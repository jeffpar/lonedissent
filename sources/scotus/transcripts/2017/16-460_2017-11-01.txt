CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

versus the District of Columbia.

Mr. Unikowsky.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Title 28 Section 1367(d) specifies

12

that the period of limitations on a

13

supplemental jurisdiction claim shall be tolled

14

while the claim is pending in federal court and

15

for a period of 30 days after it is dismissed.

16

The question before the Court this

17

morning is, what does it mean for a period of

18

limitations to be tolled?

19

hold that "tolled" means suspended, an

20

interpretation that accords with the plain

21

meaning of the word "tolled."

22

definition given in Black's Law Dictionary, and

23

that is the way "tolled" is used in every other

24

statute that uses the word "tolled," none of

25

which would make any sense under Respondent's

The Court should

That is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

interpretation.

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If that's the -- if

3

that's the way the statute operates, it seems

4

to me that the provision at the end which says

5

the state can provide for a longer tolling

6

period is generally un- -- unnecessary, if the

7

-- if the -- if -- under your position, it

8

would seem to be quite unnecessary for the

9

state to have a longer tolling period.

10
11
12

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Your Honor, states

could -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, it -- it could

13

be, of course, that they have concern about

14

there being only a week left or something, but

15

in most cases, under -- under your view, I just

16

don't see the necessity for the last clause.

17

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Your Honor, it's true

18

that typically the state savings clause won't

19

necessarily be triggered, but there are

20

certainly many sets of facts in which it would

21

be triggered.

22

enact a tolling period that's even longer than

23

the federal tolling period.

24

instance, actually restarts the clock.

25

First of all, a state could

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Louisiana, for

But they couldn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

enact a shorter one?

2
3
4

MR. UNIKOWSKY:
correct.

They could not, that's

I think this is a federal floor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In other words, your

5

-- your position gives the states zero

6

flexibility.

7

maximum flexibility; states can have it any way

8

they want.

9

to the states that don't want to have

10
11

The Respondent's gives the states

But you don't give any protection

long-delayed suits.
MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah, that is -- it is

12

certainly the case that this statute provides a

13

federal floor, and we're debating about the

14

length of the federal floor, and we believe

15

that the federal floor is longer than

16

Respondents do.

17

it's true that under our position the state

18

tolling -- the -- the savings clause will be

19

triggered less frequently under our view.

20

that's simply the necessary implication of the

21

plain text of the statute in our view.

And the effect of that is that

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But

The statute -­
Why the plain text?

24

Because 1367(d) refers to the 30-day period as

25

a tolling period too, but that period is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

recognized as a grace period, the 30-day

2

add-on.

3

as a tolling period, but it isn't, is it?

The -- the federal statute types that

4

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Your Honor, the way we

5

interpret the statute is that the clock stops

6

while the claim is pending in federal court and

7

for 30 days after it's dismissed.

8

understand the phrase "tolling period" to refer

9

to the -- the period during which the -- the

10

clock stops.

11

of the tolling period.

12

So we

So we view that 30 days as part

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does -- does "toll"

13

and -- do "toll" and "tolling" mean the same

14

thing?

15

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think that in the

16

context of this particular statute, "tolled"

17

means "suspended."

18

that in general when, you know -- there are -­

19

for instance, the Chardon case says that in

20

general the word "toll" can carry different

21

types of meanings.

22

look at the words of this particular statute as

23

to how -­

24
25

So I think that it's true

But I think that we have to

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, well, let's look

at the words of this particular statute,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

"unless state law provides for a longer tolling

2

period."

3

state statutes that suspend the period, or does

4

it also include those state statutes that

5

simply stop the clock?

6

So does that refer only to those

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So, Your Honor, I

7

think that's a -- a debatable proposition.

The

8

position we took in our reply brief is that if

9

a state grace period statute would produce the

10

arithmetic equivalent of a longer tolling

11

period than the federal statute, then that does

12

qualify as a longer tolling period.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I don't know

14

it's a debatable -- a debatable position.

I

15

think you have to take a position on it because

16

you're making a textual argument.

17

hard to make a textual argument that "tolled"

18

means something different from "tolling."

19

of the state statutes stop the clock.

20

don't suspend the period.

And it's

Most

They

21

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So let me state our -­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, unless tolling

23

includes the stop-the-clock statutes, it

24

doesn't do very much.

25

question pointed out, if it only includes the

And as Justice Kennedy's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

ones that suspend the tolling period, it does

2

virtually nothing.

3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So let me answer that

4

question.

5

"longer tolling period" is that it would

6

encompass a state statute that is the

7

arithmetic equivalent of a longer tolling

8

period.

9

So the way I understand the phrase

So the example in our reply brief we

10

give is as follows:

11

suit with five days left in the limitations

12

period and Texas gives you a 60-day grace

13

period.

14

period in that case is the arithmetic

15

equivalent of a tolling period of the pendency

16

of the federal suit plus 55 days because the

17

five more days will get you to 60.

18

Suppose you file a Texas

So the application of the 60-day grace

So the way I interpret those words is

19

that that is a longer tolling period.

Now,

20

that's debatable.

21

that, but our case certainly doesn't depend on

22

that.

23

everything I just said, I still think that the

24

grace -- state grace period statutes might

25

still apply according to their own terms.

You may disagree with me on

First of all, if you disagree with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's

Official
9
1

not obvious that this federal statute would

2

preempt the state from applying its own grace

3

period statute if it's longer.

4

I think the state might be able to apply the

5

grace period one way or the other.

6

So, in my view,

And even if you disagree with that, it

7

wouldn't affect our primary position, which is

8

that the word "tolled" means suspended.

9

be that the necessary concomitant, if you

It may

10

disagree with both of the things I just said,

11

is that the state tolling statutes would rarely

12

apply under the savings clause.

13

what the statute means, so be it.

14

that there's very powerful textual clues in

15

this statute that -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And if that's
And I think

Well, my problem

17

is that I look at statutory history; not

18

legislative history, statutory history.

19

the statutory history is that the ALI report

20

set forth a very clear grace period or -- or -­

21

grace period.

22

And

And Congress didn't adopt that

23

language.

It adopted this language.

And so,

24

if it changed it and it changed it so

25

dramatically, aren't I -- shouldn't I be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

looking at the plainer text as it reads, rather

2

than something that would have given you what

3

you wanted in a different way?

4

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yes, Justice

5

Sotomayor.

That is our exact position in this

6

case.

7

enacted it, would have done the trick for a

8

grace period.

9

I think this ALI report, had Congress

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Exactly.

10

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

11

Congress didn't use those words.

12

that that underscores that it would have been

13

so easy for Congress to enact a grace period.

14

This is not the kind of concept that's

15

difficult to express in words.

16

And in this case,
And I think

Congress could have enacted that ALI

17

report.

It could have enacted all those state

18

statutes that are cited by Respondent, none of

19

which use the word "toll."

20

just said you get 30 days after the claim is

21

dismissed.

22

But instead Congress chooses this very

23

particular wording in which it says that the

24

period of limitations is tolled while the claim

25

is pending in federal court and for a period of

Or it could have

And then we wouldn't be here today.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

30 days after it's dismissed.

2

And when you try to figure out what

3

that means, you look at the -- the way every

4

other federal statute uses the same phrasing

5

and it's very clear from those statutes that

6

they have to mean that the clock stops.

7

so, if Congress really wanted to enact a grace

8

period, it is impossible to imagine a more

9

oblique way and misleading way of doing that

10
11

And

than the words of this statute.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What do you do with

12

the Jinks case where everybody seemed to assume

13

that what 30 -- 1367(d) provided was a short

14

30-day extra time?

15

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Your Honor, I'm not

16

sure there is really a basis for saying that

17

the -- the members of the Court made that

18

assumption.

19

petition for certiorari in that case in one of

20

the merits briefs that seem to imply that

21

interpretation.

22

the opinion of the Court suggesting that the

23

constitutionality of the statute depending on

24

adopting this rather strained construction,

25

and, in fact, there's actually language in the

There are some statements in the

There's certainly nothing in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

opinion pointing in the opposite direction.

2

The Court in that opinion was

3

discussing this old Civil War era statute which

4

stopped the clock, and in the Court's opinion

5

the Court talked about that statute as tolling

6

limitations periods.

7

So, again, that's a pretty weak

8

inference, too, but I just don't see anything

9

in this opinion supporting the view that the

10

Court's decision was dependent on the fact that

11

the statute can only carry the grace period

12

interpretation.

13

I think that -- I have been talking

14

about these, the Jinks case and the statutory

15

history.

16

text because I actually think that the text is

17

extremely clear that tolling means suspending.

18

I'd like to focus a little bit on the

So if I could just make two points

19

about the text.

The first is that the statute

20

says that the period of limitations shall be

21

tolled.

22

the limitations bar, the period of limitations.

23

So Respondent's interpretation is that

Not the statute of limitations, not

24

the word tolled means removed.

So that would

25

produce the phrasing, a period of limitations

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1
2

is removed.
And that's just improper English.

So

3

just to give an example, suppose Congress were

4

enacting a statute in which it said that the

5

bar associated with filing suit in a particular

6

place was lifted, so, you know, the Court of

7

Federal Claims or something.

8
9

The statute would never say that the
Court of Federal Claims is removed.

It would

10

say that the bar associated with filing suit in

11

the Court of Federal Claims is removed.

12

And likewise here, the statute does

13

not say that the bar is removed.

14

-- excuse me, is tolled.

15

period of limitations is tolled and, therefore,

16

we think that is only consistent with an

17

interpretation that means suspended.

18

It says that

It says that the

So even in the abstract the word toll

19

can carry different meanings.

20

that's consistent with tolling the period of

21

limitations.

22

We don't think

And I think that the other textual

23

point I'd like to make is that the period of

24

limitations is tolled for two distinct periods:

25

while the claim is pending in federal court and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1
2

for a period of 30 days after it's dismissed.
And we don't think that that

3

interpretation is in any way consistent with

4

construing tolled to mean removed because you

5

don't need the tolling while the claim is

6

pending in federal court if tolled, in fact,

7

means removed.

8
9

You only need the 30 days.

And, in fact, the concept of removing
a statute of limitations while a claim is

10

pending in federal court is -- is incoherent.

11

The statute of limitations is completely

12

irrelevant when you have a presumably timely

13

claim that's already been filed.

14

And so, therefore, we think that the

15

-- the correct interpretation is to say that

16

the clock stops, which is perfectly consistent

17

with the fact that the statute defines the

18

tolling period as both the pendency of the

19

federal claim and 30 days thereafter.

20

And just one other comment about the

21

fact that the period of limitations is tolled

22

while the claim is pending in federal court.

23

So, if the statute just said that, if the

24

statute just said the period of limitations is

25

pending -- is tolled while the claim is pending

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

in federal court, period, full stop, then I

2

think there would be no debate as to what it

3

means.

4

that the clock is suspended.

5

I think we'd all agree that it means

So Respondent's position is

6

essentially that by increasing the length of

7

the tolling period, by adding 30 days, that

8

radically changes what tolling means.

9

changes the meaning of tolling from stops the

10

clock to continues the clock.

11

not the way the Court reads statutes.

12

It

And that's just

Tolled means what it means.

If toll

13

-- the tolling length -- excuse me, if the

14

period of tolling is shorter, then -- then you

15

have a shorter period, and if it's longer, then

16

you have a longer period of tolling, but

17

increasing the tolling period doesn't alter

18

what it means to toll a period of limitations.

19
20
21

If there are no further questions, I'd
reserve my -- oh, sorry, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you admit that

22

there are definitions of the term "toll" that

23

are consistent with Respondent's argument?

24

we look in dictionaries, are there not

25

definitions that are consistent with their

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If

Official
16
1

argument?

2

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I don't actually

3

think that there is.

4

dictionaries that talk about the word "tolled"

5

meaning "remove."

6

really advances the ball very much because it

7

seems to me that on both sides, in some sense

8

the statute of limitations or the limitations

9

bar is being removed.

10

So Respondent cites some

But I don't think that

The question is, what's the precise

11

mechanism behind which the limitations bar is

12

removed?

13

the clock keeps running while the period of

14

limitations is tolled, and I have been unable

15

to find any dictionary or any case that

16

understands the word tolling that way.

17

And so Respondent's position is that

And so, therefore, I understand that

18

in the abstract, toll, especially in the

19

context of, for instance, rights of entry,

20

which is a definition offered by Respondent,

21

might mean remove.

22

statutes of limitations, the concept of the

23

clock continuing to run while the period of

24

limitations is tolled seems to me completely

25

alien to the law.

But in the context of

I haven't seen any statute

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

or any case understanding the word tolling that

2

way.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think there are

4

any constitutional limitations on Congress's

5

authority to extend state statutes of

6

limitations?

7

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Yeah, I think that

8

there probably are.

So just to take the

9

extreme example, if Congress said that the

10

statute of limitations for a supplemental

11

jurisdiction claim is completely eliminated, so

12

after the claim is dismissed by -- from federal

13

court you can just bring it forever into

14

infinity.

15

unconstitutional or at least raise serious

16

questions under the -- under the necessary and

17

proper clause.

18

That probably would be

JUSTICE ALITO:

But why is your

19

interpretation more appropriate under the

20

necessary and proper clause than Respondent's?

21

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I think that the

22

way to analyze the question is to say this:

23

I think Jinks gets you a lot of the way there

24

in terms of upholding the constitutionality of

25

the statute.

It's true that Jinks didn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

Official
18
1

resolve what the statute means, but Jinks does

2

hold that some kind of tolling rule is okay.

3

And so I think the question is, is

4

this tolling -- can Congress elect to use a

5

suspension approach rather than a grace period

6

approach?

7

all members of the Court have agreed that

8

Congress gets some degree of latitude on how to

9

implement its enumerated powers.

10

I think the answer is yes, because

There is some debate among the members

11

of the Court in the Comstock case about how

12

much latitude, but everyone agrees that there

13

is some latitude.

14

modest position here under the necessary and

15

proper clause.

16

So I think we have a very

We're saying that inasmuch as that

17

latitude exists, it extends to using the

18

suspension approach, which is the common law

19

approach, according to this Court, it's the

20

approach that this Court has said is usually

21

used, and it's also an approach that's

22

ubiquitous across the United States Code.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what's notable

24

about your argument so far this morning is that

25

you haven't said one word about why your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

approach is more appropriate as a -- as a

2

policy matter than the other.

3

it's not our job to adopt policy, but in

4

determining, you know, keeping an eye on the

5

Constitution and interpreting this provision,

6

why is your approach more necessary?

7

more justified under the necessary and proper

8

clause than the Respondent's?

9

necessity in any sense of the word for your

10

And, of course,

Why is it

What is the

approach?

11

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Your Honor, I agree

12

that it's not absolutely necessary in the same

13

way that even a grace period does not have to

14

--

15
16
17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why is it more

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

I think it's more -- I

fitting?

18

think it makes perfect sense that Congress

19

would have wanted to stop the clock.

20

there is very solid policy justifications for

21

using this ubiquitous approach.

22

I think

First of all, I think that what

23

Congress is trying to do is ensure that

24

litigants are no worse off from a litigation -­

25

from a limitations perspective on the day the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

claim is dismissed, relative to the day the

2

claim was filed.

3

that if a litigant is diligent and files suit

4

one month into a three-year limitations period

5

or something like that, and then the federal

6

court sits on the case for years and years and

7

years before declining to exercise jurisdiction

8

over the -- over the state law claim, then the

9

litigants shouldn't be forced to scramble to

10

So what Congress felt was

refile within 30 days.

11

To protect that federal litigant, the

12

litigant should get all the benefit of the time

13

that was left on the clock when the claim was

14

originally filed.

15

especially compelling when one understands

16

statute of limitations as kind of measuring

10

It's a different claim.

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, you do have to

11

refile the -- the -- the supplemental

12

jurisdiction claim over which the federal court

13

declined to exercise jurisdiction.

14

But it's not as simple as just

15

refiling a new complaint.

16

things that you have to do.

17

There's a lot of

First of all, you might have to

22

You might have to figure out which

There might be a question of

which court within a particular state, you

The purpose

of the statutes of limitations are to protect

the defendants to a large extent, not just the

2

plaintiffs.

3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, that's true, but

4

I think -- first of all, I think that the -­

5

the defendants do have a measure of protection

6

in that the defendant's already seen these

7

claims.

8

surprising -­

9

So it's not like there's these very

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but you

the claims might be different, all sorts of

12

other things, you've learned new information.

13

I -- I'm just not sure that that makes much

14

sense.

15

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I think that

16

statutes of limitations reflect a balance.

17

this -- and as this Court has said many times,

18

it's true that one purpose is to protect

19

defendants, and there's another purpose, to

20

give plaintiffs a sufficiently long time to

21

sue.

And in preparing for this case -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Have you found any

statute similar to this one?

Yes, so there's lots

of statutes that stop the clock.

22

something like one and a half such statutes.

Statutes that

2

one other statute that stops the clock during

3

the pendency of another claim, and then you

4

sometimes get 30 days, depending on whether

5

certain conditions are met.

6

And there's

So it's certainly the case that this

7

particular scheme isn't particularly common.

8

However, there's lots and lots of statutes that

9

talk about tolling periods of limitation.

10

I don't think there's much debate that in

11

context those statutes have to stop the clock,

12

because if a statute just says that while your

13

administrative claim is pending the period of

14

limitations is tolled, the only way that makes

15

sense is if the clock stops.

16

that is a very common scenario.

17

And

And so -- and

And, in fact, not only in the context

18

of statutes, this Court has characterized the

19

suspension approach as the common law approach.

20

It's the approach used in the American Pipe

21

context.

22

Court has said that that's what's usually used.

23

So this is not an unusual way of running a

24

railroad.

25

In equitable tolling contexts, this

And to some extent, I think Congress

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

just kind of took a tolling approach off the

2

shelf and incorporated it into this statute

3

because that's what it does all the time.

4

think that's a pretty common way of enacting

5

legislation, and I don't think that that

6

encounters any constitutional problem.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOREN L. ALIKHAN

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

14
15

MS. ALIKHAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

16

Because a supplemental claim dismissed

17

from federal court under 1367(c) is treated for

18

statutes of limitations purposes as if it had

19

never been filed, there needed to be a

20

mechanism to ensure that those disappointed

21

federal litigants could return to state court

22

and file their claims.

23

by providing a brief window of tolling such

24

that the claim will not expire by ordinary

25

operation of state law while the claim is

1367(d) does just that,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

pending in the federal court and for 30 days

2

thereafter.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you have any

4

other federal statute that uses the words

5

"shall be tolled" to mean what you suggest, it

6

shall continue to run?

7

federal statute?

8
9

MS. ALIKHAN:

Is there any other such

So, admittedly, there is

no other statute in the U.S. Code that works in

10

this way, but Petitioner cannot point to one

11

either, because there are two features of this

12

statute that set it apart from the normal

13

"shall be tolled" statutes throughout the U.S.

14

Code.

15

And that is, first, the provision of

16

the 30-day window and, second, and I think more

17

importantly, the express and self-conscious

18

deference to state law's ability to set longer

19

tolling periods.

20

And so I think what Congress was doing

21

was enacting this statute against the backdrop

22

of the myriad state savings statutes that

23

operate in precisely this fashion.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Ms. AliKhan,

suppose you just had a statute and the "for a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

period of 30 days" was excised from it, so it's

2

"shall be tolled" while the claim is pending

3

unless state law provides for a longer tolling

4

period.

5

mean anything other than the clock is stopped

6

and resumes again -­

Would anybody read that statute to

7

MS. ALIKHAN:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9
10

That would -­
-- once the thing is

dismissed?
MS. ALIKHAN:

That would certainly be

11

a tougher case for us.

12

ordinary meaning of "toll" one might think that

13

there could be a circumstance in which you

14

might get only a little bit of time to file at

15

the end of -- when the federal court dismisses

16

the claim, but that -- you know, if Congress

17

thought that states, as states were, were

18

taking care of this problem, it wouldn't

19

necessarily have to use "tolled" just in the

20

stop-clock fashion.

21

I think still with the

I think, as this Court has said

22

throughout the cases, whether it's Hardin or

23

Chardon, "toll" has an ordinary meaning, which

24

is to do something to the statute of

25

limitations.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it does have an

2

ordinary meaning, but, honestly, until I read

3

your brief, I just sort of thought that the

4

ordinary meaning was "suspend," stop the clock,

5

so -- and then later, on some trigger point,

6

the clock starts running again.

7

And I -- you know, I had to go to the

8

dictionaries to look up what you were saying it

9

meant; whereas, you know, if I'm just any old

10

lawyer, "tolled" means one thing when it's -­

11

when it's referring to a statute of

12

limitations.

13

when you're driving on the highway, but when

14

it's referring to a statute of limitations, it

15

means you stop the clock.

16

I mean, it means something else

MS. ALIKHAN:

And I don't think that

17

is consistent with the ordinary meaning as this

18

Court has read in Hardin and Chardon.

19

sure, stop-clock tolling -- or, sorry, tolling

20

can mean to stop the clock, but as this Court

21

explained in Chardon, it's not the only

22

meaning.

23

Court's -­

24
25

To be

anything.

And there are dozens of uses of the

word "tolling" all over the place.

question that, take the words out, "and for a

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Ms. AliKhan, I

14

want you to assume something with me, but then

15

I want to give you an opportunity to do

16

something, all right?

17

So I want you to assume with me that

18

if the words "and for a period of 30 days" were

19

not in the statute, that we wouldn't be here,

20

that we would read this as a normal stop-clock

21

tolling period, and -- and that the question

22

that arises from the statute and the reason we

23

are all here comes from the addition of these

24

words "and for a period of 30 days."

25

And I just want you to tell me why you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

think the addition of those words should make

2

us read the statutes differently.

3

MS. ALIKHAN:

Sure.

So assuming that

4

stop-clock tolling only means stop-clock, or

5

that is the ordinary meaning, then we look at

6

the next two provisions of the statute.

7

the 30-day provision.

3

MS. ALIKHAN:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Also, and -­
What I'm saying is

5

that the concept of this is used, I mean, it's

6

not used commonly, but it has been used in at

7

least one other statute.

plus.
MS. ALIKHAN:

Because it said

14

But even if you think that that statute

15

functions in precisely the same way, then we

16

have to look to the "unless state law provides

17

for a longer tolling period."

18

Congress was well aware that states

19

had these tolling periods and, in fact, this

20

Court has long recognized them.

21

Congress was expressly deferring to states'

22

ability to set these periods, it seems very

23

strange then that they would have put forth a

18

and counts back three years, they see the claim

had accrued far before that.

And so, as a matter of law, at that

point, the claim is out of time and the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But what -- what do

24

you do with this Court's apparent understanding

25

of what -- what 1367(d) means in the Raygor

Heritage Reporting Corporation

case, and specifically the Court said 1367(d)

2

tolls the state statute of limitations -­

3

limitations 30 days, in addition to however

4

long the claim has been pending in federal

5

court.

6

That -- that -- that was this Court's

7

statement.

8

on, but it's a statement of what does 1367(d)

9

mean.

10
11

It wasn't what the opinion turned

It means 30 days, plus however long the

claim had been pending in federal court.
MS. ALIKHAN:

And, Justice Ginsburg, I

12

see that just as a restatement of the language

13

of the statute, which is that the tolling is

14

both while the claim is pending and for 30 days

15

thereafter.

16

This statute is unique in that it's an

17

instruction manual to state courts on what to

18

do with these claims once the federal court is

19

finished with them.

20

clear that regardless of when that limitation's

21

bar may have fallen, whether it's one day after

22

the federal suit or whether it's one day before

23

the federal dismissal, it shall not serve as a

24

bar to bringing that claim in state court.

And this language makes

a grace period statute like this.

MS. ALIKHAN:

So let me give you two

responses to that.

that you are giving, it's talking about a

federal claim that's going to be re-brought in

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I'm -- I'm not

4

sure I understand that answer.

5

mean, here, I'm not going to speak in the

6

language of a statute, but essentially Congress

7

would just be saying when the pendant claim is

8

dismissed, the person has 30 days to refile in

9

state court.

10

I mean -- I

That's a pretty easy way to state

that thing.

11

MS. ALIKHAN:

That is certainly an

12

easier way to state it.

13

Congress wanted to have a stop-clock statute,

14

they could have done what they do throughout

the U.S. Code.

they talk about how time shall not be counted

MS. ALIKHAN:

to state law.

That was one of the unsatisfactory options that

this Court looked at in Jinks and knew that

Congress was trying to remedy that problem by

saying you do not have to bring these parallel

slight intrusion on state law in that it is

24

But I think it's quite a different

category entirely to say that in every case, as

2

a rule, the time for filing in state court will

3

be subject to a federal pause button and then

an additional 30 days, where it's not

JUSTICE BREYER:

But is it -- well,

7

look, aren't there many statutes, or I don't

interpreting this statute in determining

Assuming that we think the language of "toll"

is ambiguous, either in and of itself or when

deference to state law -­

can be resolved by virtue of federalism.

want to get at, which is a serious -- I haven't

ambiguous, then I think we look to Bond, I

think we look to Gregory, I think we look to

numerous cases in which this Court has said

where a term does not expressly set how it's

entrenching on state law, one needs to read

that narrowly, consistent with principles of

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, here, how about

14

this?

15

one thing that -- that Justice Breyer should

16

read is Jinks, where the Court already upheld

17

Congress's authority to pass 1367(d) under the

18

necessary and proper clause.

19

it relied on an earlier decision of this Court,

20

which upheld a federal provision that tolled

21

state statutes of limitations by means of

22

stop-clock suspension.

23
24
25

How about -- Ms. AliKhan, I mean, maybe

And in doing so,

So, that would seem to sort of put the
kibosh on this argument, wouldn't it?
MS. ALIKHAN:

No.

I mean, if -- if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

you're referring to Jinks's reliance on Stewart

2

v. Kahn, that was an area in which there was

3

insurrection.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but it was used

--

7

If there is a federal purpose -­

MS. ALIKHAN:

-- that is met by

displacement -­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- I mean, it was -­

9

but Jinks was -- was talking about this very

10

statute and relied on Kahn to make the point

11

that federal provisions that toll state

12

statutes of limitations are perfectly

13

constitutional under the necessary and proper

14

clause, didn't it?

15

MS. ALIKHAN:

What Jinks held is that

16

it was appropriate as far as that case went.

17

There was not -- there was not a question in

18

that case of whether this statute should be

19

read to displace in every case as a rule state

20

statutes of limitations with no federal

21

purpose.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, point taken,

23

point taken, but it upheld -- but it -- but it

24

cited and relied on a case where exactly this

25

kind of suspension was at issue.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

53

And you can say yes that was in a

2

different context, but Jinks was using it for

3

this context.

4

MS. ALIKHAN:

And I think context

5

matters.

there's another reading list I need.

13

I can draw on your experience if you don't have

But here

My impression, which is not an

16

informed one, is that a lot of these cases come

17

up in the area of torts.

18

is probably -- may be a tort claim or may be an

19

employment discrimination claim, and that the

20

state statutes on those things or maybe the

21

D.C. statutes and so forth are fairly short.

22

And the state claim

they're long, it's usually property cases.

Now that's a very vague impression,

I can see that.

true that this arises mostly in a state law

talk about a variety of circumstances in which,

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you say to give

19

the -- give -- bring that claim, meaning the

20

purposes of statutes of limitations is, one, to

21

give the defendant notice, defendant has notice

22

from the federal complaint, that has both

23

federal and state claims; and the other is to

24

prevent plaintiffs from sleeping on their

25

rights.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

Plaintiff has moved promptly.

It has

2

a complaint that has two classes of claims,

3

state and federal.

4

-- this is not -- the litigant has acted

5

timely.

6

So the plaintiff, this is

MS. ALIKHAN:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg,

7

but I don't understand why acting diligently on

8

the front end gives the plaintiff the ability

9

to be dilatory by a period of two, three, four,

10

five, six years on the back end, because there,

11

yes, there is notice of the claim at the time

12

of federal filing, but once the federal suit

13

has resolved, a period of time has gone by, we

14

would submit 30 days, then the defendant thinks

15

she's not going to refile her state suit.

16

But then she could surprise a

17

defendant by saying two years, three years,

18

four years, and I think this is especially

19

significant in employment cases where you're

20

looking at back-pay awards that run from the

21

time of the adverse employment action, there is

22

a chance for gamesmanship by the plaintiff,

23

which would not happen if we were looking at

24

this as a 30-day period from while the claim is

25

pending and after its dismissal.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

But I -- I do want to get back to just

2

the structure of the statute as a whole because

3

I think that the provision of this 30-day

4

period, because it is a rarity within the U.S.

5

Code, suggests Congress was doing something

6

other than stop-clock tolling.

7

And I think combined with this

8

self-conscious legislation that defers to state

9

tolling periods, of which this Court was aware,

10

of which Congress was aware, when they were

11

enacting this statute.

12

And so 1367(d) is a precise fit to the

13

problem created by 1367(c).

And that comes

14

from the fact that a -- a case dismissed

15

without prejudice is treated as if it had never

16

been brought.

17

limitations has been ticking by the whole time.

That means the statute of

18

And to save that litigant from being

19

ousted out of a state forum by virtue of that

20

state statute of limitations, Congress said no,

21

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ADAM G. UNIKOWSKY

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

7
8
9

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I'd like to make just two rebuttal
points, one about the plain text of this

10

statute and one about the federalism

11

considerations raised by Respondent.

12

So, first of all, on the text, picking

13

up on a question by Justice Breyer, it really

14

is never the case that the phrase "period of

15

limitations is tolled" ever means that the bar

16

associated with the expiration of the period of

17

limitations is temporarily rendered

18

unenforceable while the clock continues to run,

19

which is the interpretation given by

20

Respondent.

21

Respondent offers the example of the

22

phrase that the -- a petition for rehearing

23

tolls the time to file a petition for

24

certiorari.

25

say that the period of limitations, the 90-day

But in that context, you wouldn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

period, is tolled during the entire 90-day

2

delay between the dismissal of the -- of the

3

petition for rehearing and the cert petition.

4

Maybe you would say that the start of

5

the 90-day clock is delayed until the petition

6

for rehearing is denied, but that's not

7

Respondent's position.

8

is that the tolling period consists of the

9

pendency of the petition for rehearing and the

10

Respondent's position

entire 90-day period.

11

And the word "tolled" is never used

12

that way.

13

have not found a single reference to the -- to

14

the word being used in that context.

15

Virginia statute, which we actually cite in our

16

reply brief at page 14, note 3, even that

17

Virginia statute which we acknowledge also

18

doesn't use the word "tolling" that way,

19

because even in that statute, the statute does

20

not define the period of tolling to include the

21

grace period, which is what Respondent does.

22

Not in a case, not in a statute, I

Even that

So the word "tolling" literally never

23

means what Respondent claims it means.

24

fact, I -- I actually think that the 46 U.S.C.

25

53911 statute, which Justice Kagan mentioned,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And, in

Official
61
1

is very good for us.

2

a Rosetta Stone for us because the title of

3

that statute is "Tolling of Limitations

4

Period."

5

means.

6

the clock is suspended while this

7

administrative claim is pending and for 60

8

days.

9

that tolling of a period of limitations means

10

It's -- it's almost like

And then the statute explains what it
It says that the running of the -- of

And so I think that just underscores

one thing.

11

It means that the clock stops.

So, the second point I'd like to

12

mention is this argument about federalism.

13

we're certainly mindful about the federalism

14

concerns.

15

But, first of all, constitutional avoidance is

16

not a reason to rewrite a statute.

17

that the way to adjudicate the constitutional

18

concerns is to allow the constitutional

19

argument to be aired and decide whether the

20

statute's unconstitutional, rather than

21

rewriting the statute to mean something it

22

plainly does not mean.

23

And

We're not trying to undermine them.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I think

Mr. Unikowsky, let's

24

say I'm with you on constitutional avoidance

25

and -- and using it to rewrite things.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official
62
1

what -- what about the presumption against

2

preemption?

3

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

Your Honor -­
Separate doctrine,

similar point of view.

6

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, a few things

7

about that, Your Honor.

8

don't think that the presumption against

9

preemption is a tool to rewrite statutes.

First of all, again, I

10

-- it's merely a presumption that can be

11

overcome by the text of a statute.

It's

12

Second of all, I -- I don't think that

13

the Court has typically applied the presumption

14

against preemption against statutes that so

15

plainly are intended to apply a federal rule.

16

So here's a statute that just says that the

17

federal tolling period is X.

18

plainly intended to supply a federal standard.

19

And that's

And so the question is whether this

20

federal tolling rule is -- excuse me, the

21

federal tolling period, is longer or shorter.

22

On its face, that question has nothing to do

23

with state law, and so the Court has not

24

applied the presumption against preemption in

25

that context.

We cite the -- we cite the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

Puerto Rico versus Franklin case from last

2

year, where there was clearly a federal rule

3

and the Court said that there's no presumption

4

against preemption in just interpreting a

5

plainly federal standard.

6

text of the statute.

7

Court should just do the same thing here.

8
9

You just look at the

And so I think that the

The other thing is I think that this
statute doesn't really infringe on state

10

sovereignty sufficiently to apply the sort of

11

extreme presumption that in our view would

12

essentially rewrite the text.

13

statute is readily understood as regulating

14

litigation in federal court.

15

We think the

All it's saying is that when you have

16

a claim that can be filed in federal court,

17

that has been filed in federal court, that the

18

period of limitations tolled while that claim

19

is pending in federal court.

20

Again, I think that's readily

21

understood as regulating federal court

22

litigation.

23

law to a significant -- to a sufficient extent

24

to justify effectively rewriting the statute.

25

So in our view -- but, anyway, any presumption

It's not reaching out into state

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

against preemption could not be overcome in

2

this case given that we think the text is just

3

so clear.

4

And in terms of those state statutes

5

that Respondent cites, so first of all, those

6

are just general state statutes that apply to

7

what happens when a claim is dismissed -­

8

dismissed without prejudice.

9

time, those statutes will apply as written.

10

They'll only be displaced in the particular

11

scenario where you have a claim that's brought

12

in federal court.

13

So most of the

And I think Congress could conclude

14

that it has a special relationship with

15

litigants who bring suit in federal court.

16

wants to protect those litigants by ensuring

17

that while the claim is pending in federal

18

court before a federal judge, the clock won't

19

be running down.

20

regulate the federal courts in that manner.

21

It

I think that Congress can

I agree that there are some federalism

22

implications here.

That's why I acknowledged,

23

in response to Justice Alito, that you can't

24

make these periods of limitations forever,

25

but -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, when would we

2

have a problem on federalism if it's not this

3

case?

4

actually have a problem, either under a

5

presumption against preemption or straight-up

6

constitutional issue?

7

How far would it have to go before we'd

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

Well, I gave the

8

example of -- of eliminating statutes of

9

limitations altogether.

Maybe making them 100

10

years or something might also pose a similar

11

constitutional problem.

12

relevant line -­

13

But I think that the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

A hundred years is

14

too much, six years is too little, I mean, in

15

our case, right?

So -­

16

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I -- I -­
-- so where -- where

18

do we draw the constitutional -- where would

19

you have us draw that constitutional line?

20

MR. UNIKOWSKY:

So I can't, standing

21

here right now, say that this is the -- the

22

constitutional limit.

23

this:

24

traditional, ubiquitous, common law approach

25

off the shelf.

But what I can say is

this is a statute that takes a

So I think that there should be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

a safe harbor, from a constitutionality

2

perspective, for a tolling rule that has been

3

used throughout history.

4

back to the Civil War.

5

Congress just takes a traditional tolling rule

6

off the shelf in that manner and doesn't reach

7

out to enact some extreme, unusual legislation

8

that -- that overturns state law in this

9

unexpected way, I think that that should be a

10

It was used dating
It's -- when -- when

safe harbor for Congress.

11

And so, I can't say, standing here

12

right now, that the -- there's a 10-year clause

13

or 20-year clause in the Constitution that

14

creates the line, but I just don't think that

15

this statute should be interpreted as

16

approaching those limits when it's just such a

17

traditional approach to tolling.

18
19

If there are no further questions,
we'd ask the Court to reverse.
