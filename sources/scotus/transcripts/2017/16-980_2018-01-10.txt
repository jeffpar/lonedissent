ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC E. MURPHY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. MURPHY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Congress passed the NVRA to serve

12

competing goals, increasing the number of

13

eligible registered voters but decreasing the

14

number of ineligible ones, and this

15

congressional compromise is evident in the

16

statute's conflicting mandates.

17

requires states to undertake general programs

18

to remove ineligible individuals but at the

19

same time places limits on those federally

20

mandated removal programs, including that

21

states may not remove individuals for changed

22

residence unless they fail to respond to a

23

notice and to vote over two federal elections.

MR. MURPHY:

Whether -- if there

were no (b) at all?
MR. MURPHY:

I -- I -- I think -­

11

certainly, I think, that if there is no failure

12

to vote clause, that's one of the main

13

prohibitions on which they are relying, but I

14

think you have to interpret (b) in light of

15

(d), of course.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. MURPHY:

Yes.

And (d) clearly indicates

18

that we -- if we -- so long as we send

19

individuals a notice and so long as we wait two

20

federal elections before we remove them, that

21

that is acceptable.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. MURPHY:

clause -­

-- in a way that

6

reconciles it with the use of failure to vote.

7

non-voting in (d) because -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Murphy, the -­

harbor, that Congress didn't want failure to

18

vote to be a trigger for this procedure?

19

MR. MURPHY:

I don't think so, Your

20

Honor, because I think that is a safe harbor

21

for something completely different.

22

it as a safe harbor for meeting an implicit

23

element in (d) that a state have objective

24

evidence that an individual has moved, but that

25

element is not there.

In fact, the Postal Service provision

is a safe harbor for on the other side of the

balance between removing ineligible voters and

4

keeping eligible voters on the roll.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's -­

This is a very

6

complicated system for a very simple position.

7

If you have any reason to believe someone has

8

changed address, just send them a notice and,

9

after two election cycles, disqualify them.

10

Why have the Post Office provision at

11

all?

12

I understand Ohio now is not waiting for people

13

to miss two election cycles; they're waiting -­

14

every year they're purging, right?

15
16

Why have any other provision?

MR. MURPHY:

No.

We -- we -- we run

the notices every year -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. MURPHY:

19
20

As it is,

Every year.

-- but we still wait the

-- we still wait until -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, you have

21

taken the position in your brief that you

22

really don't need anything; you need -- you

23

could send out a notice any time, any place,

24

and if someone fails to respond to it, you can

25

purge them.

Isn't that your position?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. MURPHY:

No.

No.

Our position is

2

the notice gets sent out.

3

then obviously you can't honor -­

4

If they respond,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But my point is

5

you don't even need the failure to vote two

6

years to use the notice -­

7

MR. MURPHY:

That's right.

Because a

8

statewide canvass would not be based on failure

9

to vote whatsoever.

And so that's why they

10

have to read into (d) an element that they just

11

make up from whole cloth, which is that they

12

have objective evidence of a move.

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, let -- let's

15

MR. MURPHY:

For sending the notice.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The Senate report

17

that supported the NVRA explicitly says that

18

what they wanted to avoid was a mailing that is

19

unresponded to being a cause for removing

20

someone.

21

So if that was its purpose, why

22

wouldn't it make sense that the only reason

23

that you can change -- send the notice is if

24

you have some reasonable basis to believe

25

someone has moved?

MR. MURPHY:

You have a right not to

10

So there's a -- there's a
The first was what if

I agree that there is a Senate report

11

suggesting that they were concerned that people

12

would be removed merely for failing to respond,

13

but Congress did not put an objective evidence

element into the (d) procedure in response to

15

that concern.

16

They put in the safe harbor, what -­

what they called the fail-safe voting on the

18

back end.

they still have two federal elections in which

20

they can show up to vote.

21

dealt with that provision.

22

So if an individual doesn't respond,

So that's how they

With respect to failure to vote, I

23

think the legislative history is quite clear

24

that the concern was removing individuals

25

merely for failing to vote in a recent

election.

17.

That's what the report says at page

And that's not what Ohio does.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why have the

4

three provisions having to do with the Post

5

Office notice?

6

MR. MURPHY:

Because that -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That seems like a

8

very reasonable -- why -- why do you need it at

9

all under your interpretation?

10

MR. MURPHY:

Because that is the

11

minimal effort on the other side of the

12

balance.

13

Justice Ginsburg, I think that is a safe harbor

14

for the state's obligation to engage in

15

maintenance efforts.

16

As I was trying to -- mentioned to

(a)(4) says that the states have a

17

duty to remove ineligible voters, and (c) says

18

19

obligation to remove ineligible voters by going

20

through this process.

21

one side of the balance -­

22

It's the minimum on the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, General, if I can

23

take you back to Justice Ginsburg's question

24

because it seems as though you are effectively

25

turning 8(d)(1) into a kind of safe harbor in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

this sense:

8(d)(1) says that these

2

confirmation procedures are a permissible part

3

of the program, even though part of the

4

confirmation procedures are about not voting.

5

So that's clear that 8(d)(1) says that.

6

you are trying to take that and convert it into

7

something bigger and broader, essentially

8

saying if you use these confirmation

9

procedures, your entire program is going to be

But

10

insulated from criticism, even though there's

11

another part of your program that explicitly

12

relies on non-voting.

13

And I don't see that as in any way

14

being the point of 8(d)(1).

15

take 8(d)(1), which says, sure, you can have a

16

part of the program that does this, and turn it

17

into a much bigger and broader safe harbor for

18

everything that you do.

19

MR. MURPHY:

You're trying to

So my response there

20

would be you have to interpret the words of

21

8(b)(2), the failure-to-vote clause, in a way

22

that would not prohibit what 8(d) requires.

23

And it affirmatively requires the use of

24

non-voting over two federal elections.

25

We have the proximate cause argument

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

for why the failure to respond to the notice

2

breaks the causal link.

3

debate in the 1990s between the states -­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And there was this

I -- I must say I

5

don't understand the -- I think this is a

6

little bit of a different question, but since

7

you've raised it, the proximate cause argument,

8

I don't understand, because essentially what

9

the Ohio program does is it says non-voting,

10

failure to respond, non-voting.

11

And you're trying to pick out the

12

middle piece of that and say that's the only

13

proximate cause.

14

think of proximate cause in any area.

15

That's just not the way we

MR. MURPHY:

So I think clearly the

16

"by reason of" adopts a proximate cause test.

17

This Court has repeatedly said it's a flexible

18

test.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No -- no argument on

20

that.

21

but there's more -- you know, there's more -­

22

there can be more than one proximate cause in

23

the world.

24
25

Sure, there's a proximate cause test,

MR. MURPHY:

Well, exactly, and the

Court has said that you have to pick the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

proximate cause test that fits the statute.

2

And this statute, the last cause undoubtedly is

3

failure to vote.

4

That's why I think the best way to

5

reconcile (b) and (d) is to say that a failure

6

to respond to the notice breaks any causal

7

prohibition between failure to vote and

8

removal.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

10
11

MR. MURPHY:

Why do you need the -­

And I think there was

this debate -­

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

proximate cause argument at all?

removed from the list by reason of the person's

16

failure to vote.

17

Why do you need the
What the

It can't mean but-for cause because

18

then it would run -- because the -- the statute

itself takes failure to vote into account in

22

from the list under (d).

23

but-for.

24
25

That's one of the things that is

So it can't be

And in the HAVA, Congress used the
term "solely."

So why isn't the best

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

interpretation of this that one cannot be

2

removed from the list solely because of failure

3

to vote?

4

MR. MURPHY:

That's absolutely

5

correct.

6

component of a proximate cause test, it was a

7

malleable phrase, was the sole proximate cause.

8

In CSX, the Court said one -- one

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, isn't that just

adding a word into the statute that Congress

10

wrote?

11

to vote.

12

Code where Congress wants to say sole -- you

13

know, solely by reason, and Congress says it.

14

It means something different because there are

15

lots of situations in which two components

16

together cause something.

17

The statute -- Congress said by reason
There are multiple places in the U.S.

And so to add that word "solely" is to

18

change the meaning of the statute.

19

word is not in this provision.

20

MR. MURPHY:

And that

Well, we think it's the

21

best reading to reconcile the two provisions.

22

And there was this -­

23
24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- to reconcile the two

7

provisions.

8

from HAVA was not the only provision that was

9

adopted in HAVA.

10

And, remember, the solely clause

In addition, HAVA, when it added that

11

solely clause, also added the clarifying

12

amendment to the failure to vote.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, everybody is

14

looking here for a way to reconcile these two

15

provisions.

16

provisions are like, okay, what do we do with

17

these?

18

I mean, you're right, these two

But why isn't the obvious way to

19

reconcile the two provisions just to say, look,

20

you got this failure-to-vote clause, but don't

21

think that this failure-to-vote clause bars a

22

state from using the confirmation procedures.

23

It doesn't bar a state from using the

24

confirmation procedures.

25

permissible part of the state program.

That can be a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

So that's your way to reconcile the

2

two things.

Taken on its own, the

3

failure-to-vote clause looks as though it might

4

bar confirmation procedures.

5

procedure says, no, not these.

6

MR. MURPHY:

The confirmation

So, look, I think that

7

may have been one reconcile -- one way to

8

reconcile it.

Our way may have been one way to

9

reconcile it.

The states debated the federal

10

government on this precise issue throughout the

11

1990s, and then Congress intervened and

12

reconciled it with the addition of the solely

13

clause and the HAVA provision.

14
15

JUSTICE KAGAN:
in HAVA -­

16
17

But the solely clause

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I'm looking at -­

I'm listening -­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- is a completely

19

independent provision in a completely

20

independent statute.

21

clarifying amendment, which we can talk about,

22

and the solely clause is -- it's a part of a -­

23

a different provision in a different statute

24

dealing with a related but different subject

25

matter.

I mean, it's not the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

So there would be no reason to take

2

one provision that says solely, and says

3

because that provision says solely, we're going

4

to treat this provision as also saying solely

5

when this provision does not say solely.

6

In fact, we have a rule against that

7

in statutory interpretation.

8

look, Congress knows how to do a solely

9

provision.

10

Usually, we say,

It didn't do it here.

MR. MURPHY:

But what it did add in

11

the same law, in the HAVA law that -- in the

12

computerized list maintenance for statewide

13

programs that uses solely, and then with

14

respect to the failure-to-vote clause in the

15

NVRA, it adopted a clarification amendment that

16

said except that nothing in this provision

17

shall be construed to prohibit the state from

18

using the procedures in (c) and (d).

19

think you have to interpret the clarification

20

amendment with the solely clause because it was

21

in the same law.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I

Well, that's exactly

23

what the clarifying amendment says.

You're

24

exactly right.

25

interpret the failure-to-vote clause as

It says don't -- don't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

preventing use of the confirmation procedures.

2

And that's my point about how these

3

two things are reconcilable.

4

amendment says how they're reconcilable.

5
6
7

The clarifying

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I'm missing -- I'm

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Don't -- don't

sorry.

8

interpret the failure-to-vote clause as barring

9

the confirmation procedures.

States can use

10

the confirmation procedures, but that doesn't

11

mean that they can do anything else that they

12

want to on top of the confirmation procedures.

13

MR. MURPHY:

So -- so you still -­

14

it's a -- it's a rule of clarification.

15

says you have to construe (b)(2).

16

that with that, combined with the solely

17

clause, makes quite clear that you have to

18

interpret the "by reason of" language in some

19

way to break the causal link between voting and

20

removal that is required in (d).

21

So it

And I think

I think interpreting it to be the sole

22

cause is the way to accomplish that feat.

23

think that's why there was a clarification

24

amendment on the one hand in (b) and -- and the

The public

Can we get to the

essence of this case?
It appears as if what you're -- you're
reading is that the failure to vote is enough

10

evidence to suggest that someone has moved.

11

That seems to be your position because it can

12

be the only one.

13

But is that a reasonable effort to

14

draw that conclusion when you do results in

15

disenfranchising, disproportionately, certain

16

cities where large groups of minorities live,

17

where large groups of homeless people live, and

18

across the country they're the group that votes

the least, in -- in large measure because many

of them work very long hours.

All of these impediments

So if the word "reasonable effort" has

any meaning with a Congress who said that the

failure to vote is a constitutional right, how

7

can we read this statute to permit you to begin

8

a process of disenfranchising solely on the

basis of that with no independent evidence

You can use the Post Office.

What -- what are the statistics that show that

22

the vast majority of people that you

disenfranchise from voting, that you strike

3

And that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, when it gave

12

MR. MURPHY:

But that was an example

13

from meeting our minimum duty on the other side

amount of protections for eligible voters and a

minimum requirement on the states to undertake

minimum requirement on the voter who gets your

MR. MURPHY:

Absolutely, the statute

MR. MURPHY:

No, there's no -- there's

that there's limitations on the trigger.

With respect to -- to minorities, I

would add, by the way, that our position is not

Thank you, Your

So I really would like to get back to

context is quite powerful.

you had states, from 1994 all the way up to the

14

that (b) could somehow be read to actually make

15

(d) inoperative.

On the other hand, you had

There was nobody who made the argument

16

Under our view, the clarification in

17

HAVA was designed specifically to address the

18

-- the long-standing debate that started even

19

before -- before -- before the statute became

20

effective, states were suggesting that they

21

should engage in approaches like Ohio's, all

22

the way to the final FEC report, where South

23

Dakota suggested clarifying the NVRA in a way

24

that's quite helpful to the states here.

25

HAVA was passed and it had two provisions.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
25
1

It had the clarifying amendment,

2

expressly a clarifying amendment, on the one

hand, and then it had the related provision

dealing with statewide list maintenance, which

is effectively a comparable -- comparable

decision.

I think if you read both

How many states do

it this way?

13

understand it, if you've missed just one

14

election.

15

That is, you get the notice, as I

MR. MURPHY:

That's incorrect.

If you

16

missed -- if you have no voter activity over a

17

two-year period, which would include one

18

general election and then one off-year election

19

and any primary elections as well.

20
21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yeah.

Are there

other states who do it just like Ohio?
MR. MURPHY:

There are several -- many

23

states who -- I think around eight that use

24

failure to vote as the trigger for the notice.

25

I don't -- some -- some use two, some use three

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

years, some use four years.

2

But the problem with my -- my friend's

3

position on the other side is it would not only

4

outlaw all of those states, those who use

5

failure to vote as the trigger for sending the

6

notice; it would outlaw any state that takes

7

into account failure to vote on the front end.

8

And that includes many states that target

9

individuals who have not voted recently with a

10

non-forwardable mailing and then respond to

11

that non-forwardable mailing with a

12

confirmation notice for any -- any individuals

13

who the non-forwardable mailing is bounced back

14

to.

15

That would be equally prohibited under

16

the logic of their argument here today because

17

they are saying any front-end use of non-voting

18

would be illegal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. NOEL J. FRANCISCO

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

3

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

4
5
6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
If I could begin with Justice

7

Kennedy's question.

Justice Kennedy, we think

8

that Ohio's process was permissible before

9

Congress enacted the clarification amendment in

10

2002, but the clarification amendment made it

11

even clearer for two basic reasons.

12

First, sections 8(c) and 8(d), that's

13

the Postal Service process and the notice

14

process, require that non-voting be the

15

immediate cause for removal.

16

can -- you can construe 8(b)(2) as not

17

prohibiting that is if 8(b)(2) is limited to

18

removing people only solely by reason of their

19

failure to vote.

20

The only way you

And, second, this reflected a

21

significant shift in the federal/state balance

22

at the time.

23

removed people solely for failure to vote.

24

Others had notice processes that were far less

25

protective than Ohio's notice process.

Prior to the NVRA, many states

Heritage Reporting Corporation

None of

Official
28
1

them had a four-year waiting period.

2

What the NVRA did was it required

3

everybody to improve their processes well

4

beyond what they were before the NVRA was

5

passed, but beyond that, left the states with

6

flexibility.

7

statute that says that, within that range of

8

flexibility, states are barred from using a

9

non-voting trigger in conjunction with 8(d)'s

10

And there's nothing in the

protective notice process.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, could you

12

tell me, there's a 24-year history of solicitor

13

generals of both political parties under both

14

-- presidents of both political parties who

15

have taken a position contrary to yours.

16

Before the amendment and after the amendment.

17

In fact, the Federal Election

18

Commission, when it wrote to Congress with

19

respect to the Help America Vote Act, took the

20

position the old solicitor generals were

21

taking.

22

say the Act before the clarification said

23

something different.

24
25

Everybody but you today come in and

Seems quite unusual that your office
would change its position so dramatically.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official
29
1

might accept it if you thought that the Help

2

America Vote Act, in fact, clarified something

3

that was ambiguous, but you're taking a very

4

different position.

5

that Act, it was clear you could do it this

6

way.

7

You're saying even before

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, what

8

I'm saying is I think that the Help America

9

Vote Act and the clarification amendment made

10

it even clearer and after that clarification

11

amendment -­

12
13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, so please

explain the change of position.

14

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Sure.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

After that many

16

presidents, that many solicitor generals, this

17

many years -- the vast majority of states, over

18

35 -- over 40, actually, who read it the way

19

your opponents read it, most people read it

20

that way -- how did the solicitor general

21

change its mind?

22

have an impact, a negative impact on certain

23

groups in this society?

24
25

Do you believe this doesn't

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor,

I believe that after Congress passed the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

clarification amendment, it clarified what was

2

at the time an ongoing debate between the

3

Department of Justice and the states.

4

And the only plausible way to read

5

that public context -- and with respect to some

6

members of this Court, public context is not

7

legislative history, it's -­

8
9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So point me where

in the legislative history people say that with
absolute clarity.

11

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well -- yeah.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

As I understand

13

the legislative history, both sides are saying,

14

in its history, this helps us.

15

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And, Your Honor -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's as

17
18

ambiguous as the language may be.
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Public context is

19

not legislative history.

Even the most diehard

20

textualists look to the public context in which

21

a law was enacted.

22

Scalia's opinion in Branch versus Smith and

23

Professor Manning's article in What Divides

24

Textualists From Purposivists?

25

context makes clear that the only thing that

I refer you to Justice

And that public

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

was in need of clarification at the time the

2

clarification amendment was passed was

3

precisely this question, whether states like

4

Ohio's could use a non-voting trigger in

5

conjunction with the 8(d) process.

6

And there's nothing in this statute

7

that bars that.

I think it reflects the

8

balance that Congress was trying to strike in

9

the NVRA between, on the one hand, dramatically

10

increasing the number of voters on the voter

11

rolls but, on the other, giving states the

12

flexibility they need to manage the issues that

13

arise when you have overinflated voter rolls.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was it the position

15

of the United States -- I thought it was, but

16

you correct me if I'm wrong -- I thought that

17

-- that the United States was taking the

18

position, consistently, that non-voting was not

19

a reliable indicator of residence change.

20

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, that's

21

partly correct.

Our prior position was based

22

on an understanding of the statute that read

23

into it a reliable evidence requirement, and we

24

said that non-voting was not that kind of

25

reliable evidence.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

Our current position is that when you

2

look at the statute, there's simply no way to

3

read into it a reliable evidence requirement

4

that's found nowhere in the text and that

5

Congress, in fact, rejected.

6

reflects this federal/state balance where

7

8(b)(2) and 8(d) set a very protective floor,

8

required everybody to be far more protective of

9

voters than they were before the Act was

And, again, it

10

passed, but beyond that floor, left the states

11

with flexibility over the management of their

12

list-maintenance programs precisely so they

13

could address the other side of the compromise,

14

which was giving states the flexibility they

15

need to address the issues that arise when you

16

have bloated voter rolls.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, it would be

18

right, isn't it -- I think you acknowledge this

19

-- that if your position is correct, that the

20

failure to vote clause simply doesn't apply to

21

removal programs for change of residence.

22

that correct?

23

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Is

Your Honor -­

Because, of course,

all those programs have to use the confirmation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

procedures, and your position -­

2

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah.

-- is that if you use

4

the confirmation procedures, that's a -­

5

basically, that's an out for everything?

6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

That's correct,

7

but it does have much broader application.

8

they -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If

Not much broader

10

application, because how could you possibly use

11

failure to vote to -- for, you know, mental

12

incapacity or criminal convictions.

13

broader application does it have?

What

14

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

15

it is -- it does a couple of things.

16

the principal things -- issues at the time the

17

NVRA was passed was what you put your finger

18

on.

19

a kind of use-it-or-lose-it mentality to the

20

right to vote, you either exercise it or you

21

lose it.

22

that off the table.

23

Well, what I think
One of

This practice among some states of having

And they definitely wanted to take

The other thing they wanted to do was

24

make sure that you could never use failure to

25

vote to conclusively presume that any other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

basis for removal was met.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But I guess

3

what I'm asking, General, is sort of two

4

related questions.

5

your position is to say, look, we don't mean

6

for this failure-to-vote clause to apply to

7

programs about change of residence, why didn't

8

Congress just say that?

Number 1, if the effect of

That's Number 1.

9

And, Number 2, I mean, I -- I can see

10

the point that it's not -- it doesn't make the

11

failure-to-vote clause completely meaningless,

12

but I'm still looking for the place where it

13

has some real impact on anybody's -­

14

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Sure.

-- voting programs.
And I think it's

17

because, and this comes out in some of the

18

legislative history, prior to the NVRA, states

19

simply used failure to vote as a proxy for the

20

whole panoply of grounds for removal.

21

They didn't necessarily tie it to this

22

basis or that basis.

23

concerned about simply relying on the failure

24

to vote.

25

And Congress was very

So they wanted to take it completely

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

off the board.

And (b)(2) is the only

2

provision in this statute that takes it

3

completely off the board and says nobody can

4

ever be -- be removed merely for their failure

5

to vote.

6

But when you combine non-voting with

7

the 8(d) process, the very protective process

8

that Congress set that required everybody to

9

improve their procedures, there's simply

10

nothing in the statute that prohibits that, and

11

the clarification amendment makes that even

12

clearer.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But with respect,

14

General, I don't think you answered either of

15

the two questions that I asked you, so I'll try

16

again.

17

Why wouldn't they just have said the

18

failure-to-vote clause doesn't apply to -- to

19

-- to -- to where a state uses the confirmation

20

procedures?

21

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor,

22

I -- I don't know the answer to that.

23

would say that the NVRA is not one of these

24

statutes that I would hold up as a paradigm for

25

legislative draftsmanship, but -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And I

Official
36
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So the second

2

question is what is left of the failure-to-vote

3

clause, practically speaking?

4

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

It takes

5

completely off the table using failure to vote

6

as a conclusive presumption for any other

7

ground for removal.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

ground are we talking about?

10
11
12

Well, what other

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, prior to the

NVRA -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, it's not -­

13

nobody used it as a presumption for mental

14

incapacity.

15

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, Your Honor,

16

actually, the legislative history makes clear

17

that prior to the NVRA, they used it as a

18

presumption for meeting the whole panoply of

19

different bases for removal.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, wasn't it -­

21

wasn't it itself considered to be a ground for

22

being removed?

23

states didn't regard it necessarily as a proxy

24

for anything else.

25

that it was use it or lose it.

It wasn't necessarily -- these

They just took the position
If you didn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

vote for a certain period of time, that was

2

grounds for taking your name off the

3

eligibility list.

4

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

That's absolutely

5

correct, and that's why it meant to address

6

both of those issues, those states that had a

7

use-it-or-lose-it mentality, you can never do

8

that, and those states that used it to

9

conclusively presume that some other basis for

10
11

removal has been met.
But here Ohio joins the initial

12

failure to vote with the very process that

13

Congress established for determining whether

14

somebody has been removed from the voter rolls.

15

And with respect to the notion that

16

somehow 8(d)(1)(B) does not set forth a

17

separate process apart from the 8(c) Postal

18

Service process, it clearly does.

19

at Section 8(d), there are two provisions.

20

If you look

There's 8(d)(1)(A) which allows you to

21

remove somebody if they've notified you that

22

they've moved, clearly a standalone process.

23

8(d)(1)(B) is simply the corollary to that.

24

you haven't notified us that you've moved, here

25

is another process that states can use to make

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

9
10
11

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Smith.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I think it's important to recognize

12

that the Supplemental Process violates Section

13

8 of the NVRA in two distinct ways.

14

it violates the failure-to-vote clause, as

15

we've been discussing, but it also violates

16

8(a) because 8(a) sets out an exclusive list of

17

four bases that can be used for purging people

18

from the rolls, and bars states from doing it

19

under any other circumstances.

20

Of course,

And the Supplemental Process, the way

21

it is designed, it assures that many, indeed

22

probably most of the people who are purged,

23

have not moved, let alone moved to a different

24

county or state, which is the only moves that

25

can justify a purge under the plain terms of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39

the NVRA.

2

It simply doesn't provide adequate

3

evidence to come to the conclusion that the

4

person has moved at all.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, your argument is

6

that failure to vote is not one of the listed

7

grounds for being removed, right?

8

that's the argument you just made.

9

MR. SMITH:

10

That's -­

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But is that what Ohio

11

does?

12

ground for removal, or does it say that moving

13

out of the district is a ground for removal,

14

and failure to vote plays a part in the

15

determination of whether a person has moved out

16

of the district?

17

the -- the ground for removal in and of itself.

18

Does it say the failure to vote is a

It's evidentiary.

MR. SMITH:

It's not

Well, of course, they do

19

say that they are -- they're using the change

20

of residency provision of 8(a) and that that's

21

what they're trying to -- to justify the

22

Supplemental Process with.

23

does not do that, then it becomes illegal.

24
25

But if, in fact, it

And the reality is that the -- the
failure to vote for two years tells you almost

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

nothing about whether or not anybody has moved.

2

Fifty or 60 percent of the voters in Ohio

3

routinely don't vote over a two-year period.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, I understand

5

that.

if you have not voted for 20 years, then we're

going to send out the notice.

that that violates this Act?

10

My -- I wonder what your answer would be
Suppose the state statute said that

MR. SMITH:

Would you say

Well, it plainly violates

11

the Act, Your Honor, because the Act says you

12

can't use failure to vote as the reason for

13

purging somebody from the rolls.

14

Supplemental Process does is it says we -- the

15

reason we think this person has moved is

16

because they haven't voted.

17

piece of evidence that they have when they

18

purge somebody that they have moved.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what the

It is the only

Only -­

You think that if

20

somebody hasn't voted for 20 years, that

21

doesn't raise an inference that the person has

22

moved or died?

23

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, in the

24

legislative history, they rejected amendments

25

precisely like that.

They even rejected a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

100-year rule.

2

to vote to be the basis for which people are

3

purged.

4

They said we don't want failure

JUSTICE ALITO:

In and of itself, but,

5

I mean, that isn't enough even to spark an

6

inquiry by sending a -- a postcard saying if,

7

in fact, you've just decided you didn't want to

8

vote for 20 years, but you really want to keep

9

your name on the list, and you're still in the

10

district, send this back.

11

illegal?

12

MR. SMITH:

That would be

Your -- Your Honor, we're

13

talking about the people who don't send it

14

back, which, by the way, is the large majority

15

of people.

16

back, what that tells you is absolutely nothing

17

about whether the person has moved.

18

And when you don't get the notice

And so, when you get to the end of the

19

three stages of the process, two years of

20

non-voting, not getting the notice back, you

21

have no idea why or where, and four more years

22

of non-voting, the only evidence that they have

23

that the person has moved is they're not

24

voting.

25

that they're being purged.

So it is, in fact, the sole reason

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if not getting the

notice back tells you nothing, why did Congress

make that part of the determination?

about people -- Justice Breyer's question also

MR. SMITH:

People who move, there are

a variety of ways that you -- you find them.

7

If they move within the state, the first thing

8

that happens is the Bureau of Motor Vehicles

has a change-of-address process, and under the

10

NVRA and under Ohio process, if you change your

11

MR. SMITH:

Well, when people move to

20

a different place in Ohio, they're required to

21

do -- to notify them within 10 days.

22

the law.

23

But then you have the NCOA process.

24

people move to another county or state, the

25

odds are they posted a forwarding address with

That's

Whether people do that, I don't know.
When

That address then, on an

2

annual basis, gets -- gets -- those addresses

get compared to the -- the statewide database,

and those people get taken care of long before

the Supplemental Process.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But are there -- are

commonsense argument, or are there statistics

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That when you -­

that when you move, you always notify -- notify

22

I don't think there

I'm sorry,

I thought I read it was 40 or

MR. SMITH:

No, Your Honor.

The

23

statistic in -- in the record is that 40

24

percent of the mail that gets returned for -­

25

not posted a forward address.

It's a much -­

2

likely to be a much smaller percentage of

people who don't actually forward -- do that

when they move to a different county or state.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

interpretation, could -- under your

7

interpretation, could Ohio send address

8

verification notices to the entire electorate

9

and -- and then do what it's doing?

10

MR. SMITH:

Under -- under your

The confirmation -- the

11

forwardable ones that they do under the

12

confirmation process, if they did that to the

13

entire electorate, it would not violate

14

8(b)(2), but it would most assuredly violate

15

8(a) because -­

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Right.

So the fact

17

that they use a general mail -- mail to

18

everybody wouldn't affect the outcome in your

19

view?

20

MR. SMITH:

No, it wouldn't, Your

21

Honor, because what happens is if 70 percent of

22

the people don't return them -- that's what the

23

statistics show about the notices in 2011:

24

10 percent were returned as undeliverable,

25

20 percent were returned, and 1.2 million

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

people just threw them in the circular file.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about sending a

3

card?

4

questions is because I don't believe Congress

5

would have passed a statute that would prevent

6

a state from purging a voting roll of people

7

who have died or have moved out of the state.

8
9

Look, the reason I'm asking these

So I'm trying to reconcile the two.
And, therefore, I ask you what the state's

10

supposed to do for that latter objective.

11

suppose they send a card which says no

12

forwarding.

13

of that is that if the person has moved, and

14

they wait long enough, and they send it a

15

couple of times, the post office will send it

16

back and then they'll know the person has

17

moved.

18

Don't forward.

MR. SMITH:

And

And their theory

Your Honor, that is the

19

precise system that 14 or so states use to

20

identify people who have moved, and the key

21

feature of it is that it's not forwardable

22

because then it comes back if they have moved.

23
24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, that's right.

And you think that's okay?
MR. SMITH:

4

MR. SMITH:

JUSTICE BREYER:

MR. SMITH:

7

I think it's okay too.

JUSTICE BREYER:
fine.

Okay.

All right.

Fine,

I got my answer.

MR. SMITH:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

Now -­

But you then have to go

10

12

Okay.

into the confirmation process.

8
9

I'm asking you if you

Yes.
Can I add one thing

to it?
I -- I'd like to add that because they

14

don't want to send non-forwardable cards to

15

everyone since it's expensive -- in a state

16

like California, it might cost several -- tens

17

of millions of dollars -- what they do is they

18

send those non-forwardable cards to people who

19

haven't voted for three or four years.

20

Now is it okay?

21

MR. SMITH:

Okay?

If they only proceed to

22

purge people when it comes back and says no

23

longer at this dress -- address, undeliverable,

24

I think it's fine, Your Honor, because it's not

25

based on non-voting at that point.

It's based

2

on concrete, reliable evidence -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so the

3

triggering event can be the failure to vote?

4

would have thought that's inconsistent with the

5

rest of your argument, which says what's wrong

6

with this case is that they used failure to

7

vote to trigger the sending of the notice.

8
9

MR. SMITH:

I

Well, Your Honor, I -- I

think that -- that you could differ -­

10

reasonable people could differ about this,

11

whether that is -- that is illegal, but I -- I

12

think when you have an intervening cause that

13

very clearly says this person has moved, just

14

as when they return the confirmation notice and

15

they say they've moved, then it's okay even if

16

they -- the reason they got the notice was

17

non-voting.

18

information that says this person has moved.

19

You have then some concrete

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but, I

20

mean, then I would -- the response is really

21

the -- the substance of your argument, which is

22

it's still triggered by the failure to vote,

23

and the law says you cannot use failure to vote

24

in -- in one of these processes.

25

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

that -- what the law says is failure to vote

2

can't be the reason you're purging them.

3

when you -- when -- when the only evidence you

4

have at all that they have moved is not voting,

5

then that's clearly the reason that you are

6

purging them.

And that's what the Supplemental

7

Process does.

For the people that don't return

8

the card -­

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And

The reason they're

10

purging them is they want to protect the voter

11

rolls from people that have not -- that -- that

12

have moved and they're voting in the wrong

13

district.

14

talking about are the -- the best tools to -­

15

to implement that reason, to implement that

16

purpose.

17

That's the reason.

MR. SMITH:

What we're

And Congress thought the

18

worst thing you could do to try to find people

19

who have moved is just look at who isn't voting

20

because there were two problems with it.

21

Congress knew there were vast numbers of people

22

who simply choose not to vote and that that was

23

therefore a terribly inaccurate way to identify

24

people who have moved, and it also said very

25

specifically people -- it's unfortunate that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

people don't vote, but they have a right not to

vote.

that true?

JUSTICE ALITO:

sensitive subject.

7

matter, there are strong arguments on both

8

sides.

9

It's a

There are -- as a policy

Congress had struck a compromise.

10

What we have before us is a question of

11

statutory interpretation, not a question of

12

what we think would be the ideal system for

13

achieving the result of removing people who

14

have moved from the voter lists.

15

And you haven't said very much about

16

the language of the statute.

17

MR. SMITH:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, Your Honor.
How do you get -- if

19

"by reason of a person's failure to vote" is

20

not but-for cause, how do you get around the

21

language of (b)(2)?

22

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, the -­

23

the language of (b)(2), I think, strongly

24

supports our position because what it says is

25

you can't have a system that uses non-voting as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

the reason for purging somebody, except you can

2

use (c) and (d), which is to say you can use

3

the confirmation process.

4

can come into play at the end of the process,

5

not at the beginning of the process.

And so non-voting

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

7

isn't what (b)(2) says.

8

can't use failure to vote as a reason for

9

removing someone, except that you can do what

10

But that actually
It does not say you

is set out in --- in (c) and (d).

11

What it says is that the principle

12

that you can't use failure to vote as a reason

13

for removing someone may not be construed to

14

prohibit.

15

interpret the first part of (b)(2).

16

an exception to the first part of (b)(2).

17

So the -- it -- it tells you how to

MR. SMITH:

It is not

Right, but it is -- it is

18

an explanation that the one kind of

19

consideration of non-voting that -- that it -­

20

that it should not be construed to prohibit is

21

the part that comes in at the end of the

22

process.

23

that -- the sequence.

24

not responded to the notice and, then, they

25

have not voted for two -- two consecutive

And then they went on to emphasize
They say (a), they have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56

elections.

2

was trying to preserve and to eliminate the

3

tension, perceived tension, between (b) and (d)

4

in the old version.

5

That is very clearly what Congress

JUSTICE ALITO:

It says -- it says

6

that -- that it's all right if you followed

7

either (c) or (d).

8
9

MR. SMITH:

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. SMITH:

16

Well, I think you need to

follow -­

14
15

Well, it says -- you

think you have to follow (c) and (d)?

12
13

(c) and (d), Your Honor,

with respect.

10
11

And what -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's not what it

says.
MR. SMITH:

You need to follow

17

something like (c) because clearly Congress

18

anticipated that there would be something that

19

would tell you that they have moved before you

20

go into the confirmation process, because the

21

confirmation process consists, if they don't

22

get the notice back, of no evidence at all

23

about whether they've moved from the notice.

24

And four more years of non-voting, precisely

25

the thing Congress said should not be the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

reason that you purge somebody.

2

So the whole system only makes sense

3

if you assume there's something like the NCOA

4

process or some other indication that they have

5

moved before you put them into the process, and

6

if you don't have that, you're going to vastly

7

over-purge people.

8

does because so many people don't vote for two

9

years and they get put into this process where

That's precisely what Ohio

10

70 percent of them don't send back the notice

11

and in four -- four more years of non-voting,

12

you're going to end up with -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

You just told me that

14

it doesn't matter how many years is required by

15

the trigger.

It could be 10.

16

MR. SMITH:

17

that's what the statute says.

18

that -­

19
20

It could be 20.

Yes, Your Honor, because

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that's -­

Well, where does the

-- where does the statute say that?

21

MR. SMITH:

The statute -- well, it

22

says two things:

23

unless you have good reason to think they've

24

moved.

25

It says A, don't purge people

That's (a).
JUSTICE ALITO:

And -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

MR. SMITH:

And in (b), don't purge -­

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- and not voting for

3

20 years isn't good reason to think that

4

they've moved?

5

MR. SMITH:

Well, it -- it -- they -­

6

they might be.

7

lots of people probably stay registered much

8

longer than 20 years and don't move for 20

9

years.

10

I don't believe so.

I mean,

It's not an unusual thing in -- in our

country, I would believe.

11

In any event, the -- the -- the

12

statute that we're dealing with here says that

13

the -- the reason you're purging them cannot be

14

their non-voting.

15

of the Supplemental Process, that is the only

16

evidence they have that anybody has moved.

17

And when they get to the end

Weak as it is, it's six years of

not respond to a notice that says you're going

2

to lose the registration if you don't vote

through the two years, two elections.

4

tells them something.

5

MR. SMITH:

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So it

Well -­
They have more

7

evidence than just that they haven't voted.

8

And you've indicated that under some

9

circumstances, the method of the notification

10

as we have in the states that you reference in

11

pages 14 to 15, that that is okay, even though

12

it's triggered solely by the failure to vote.

13

So I -- I don't think you can maintain

14

in a principled way the acceptance of the

15

validity of those states' positions and -- and

16

your argument against the position here.

17

you may say:

18

because of the -- the -- the -- the quality of

19

the information you get from one notice or

20

another, but you can't just attack this on the

21

basis that it's triggered by the failure to

22

vote.

Now,

Well, it makes a difference

23

You have to say failure to vote, plus

24

a method of notification that you think is not

25

sufficient, because you do think in other cases

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

failure to vote plus a different method of

2

notification would be okay.

3

MR. SMITH:

But -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, maybe

5

your position still is the same, but it can't

6

just base on the fact of failure to vote being

7

the trigger.

8
9

MR. SMITH:

We're -- we're talking

about the people who don't return the notice.

10

And I think it's clear that nobody would claim,

11

and Ohio doesn't claim, that when they don't

12

get anything back from the person, that that

13

tells them anything about whether they're still

14

living in the same place where they sent the

15

notice or whether they moved to some other

16

place.

17

They're forwardable.

They have no

18

idea which trash can it was thrown in, at the

19

original address or some other address.

20

simply doesn't give them any information.

21

Now the alternative -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It

Well, but they

23

say they get more information.

It's not just

24

that it's not -- you know, that it's not

25

returned, but that they've gotten the notice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

and they haven't voted in the subsequent

2

elections.

3

MR. SMITH:

Right, right.

So the -­

4

the -- in the end of the day, they have six

5

years of non-voting that tells them -- they say

6

that's some evidence that they've moved.

7

some evidence.

8

it's some evidence.

9

statute says you need a lot better evidence

It is

It's pretty weak evidence, but
But it -- the -- the

10

than that.

11

to do is -- is use non-voting because people

12

have a right not to vote.

13

them punish -- punished for it.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

18

And we don't want

Well, maybe

I'm just repeating myself, but -­

16
17

And the one thing we don't want you

MR. SMITH:

Maybe I am too, Your

Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- you don't

19

just have the failure -- maybe we're both just

20

repeating.

21

(Laughter.)

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We -- we don't

23

-- you don't just have the failure to vote.

24

You have the failure to vote, plus the

25

notification that you need to do something

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

because you haven't voted.

2

Now, in some situations, you think the

3

notification is sufficient, so you would say in

4

those, it's not just the failure to vote.

5

in this case, you say the notification is not

6

sufficient, so it is just the failure to vote.

7

MR. SMITH:

But

It's a fundamental

8

difference between when you get back something

9

the post office -- from the post office that is

10

undeliverable, no longer at this address, and

11

when you get nothing back.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, I

13

understand that, but the point is that your

14

argument then really turns on the adequacy of

15

the notice and not simply the fact that the

16

notice is triggered by a failure to vote.

17

MR. SMITH:

Well, I think, Your Honor,

18

the -- the notice that's in the statute, the

19

forwardable notice that Congress specifies has

20

to be forwardable, was not designed to be a

21

test of whether people have moved.

22

It was designed to be a safeguard, a

23

notice process telling people their rights were

24

at risk, and they either have -- have to return

25

it or they need to vote sometime pretty soon or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

they're going to lose their registration

2

status.

3

To turn it into the test, the -- the

4

state says we can give this to everybody and -­

5

and then purge people when they don't return

6

the notice on the assumption that that means

7

they haven't voted -- haven't -- they've moved,

8

if they don't return the notice and they -­

9

they don't vote for four years, it's -- the

10

thing about that kind of notice is when it -­

11

when 70 percent of the people don't return it,

12

which is what happened in 2011 in Ohio, the

13

ones who don't return it, you have no more idea

14

whether they've moved or not moved, it's no

15

more likely -­

19

I mean, this does seem at the moment to

You think that sending a notice, which

20

is forwardable, is not going to tell you not

21

much when it comes back because so many people

22

just don't return notices.

MR. SMITH:

You think that returning a notice

MR. SMITH:

JUSTICE BREYER:

His point is we have

support you or will support them?

MR. SMITH:

Your Honor, there is no

evidence about whether or not people who failed

to return the notice have moved, because they

have never claimed it was evidence that they

talk, if I could, about this concept of

up here.

concept here because the -- the term that the

10

I think it's -- it's a misplaced

Congress used multiple times was "reason."

11

And I think the reason has to be

12

something that is causally linked to the

13

underlying reason, which is that they think

14

you've moved to a different county or state.

15

And the only evidence they have at the end of

16

the Supplemental Process of that is the

17

non-voting.

18

They don't even claim that the

19

people -- the 70 percent of people who don't

20

return the notice, that that's evidence of

21

anything.

22

through.

23

requirement that Congress imposed, but it's not

24

the reason that anybody is being purged in

25

terms of the underlying issue of whether

It is a hoop they have to go
It is a -- it is a safeguard, it is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

they've -- they've moved.

2

But even if you want to do this

3

proximate cause concept, as Justice Kagan

4

pointed out, there are three things that have

5

to happen:

6

failure to return the notice, and four more

7

years of non-voting.

9

Two years of non-voting, the

And calling the non-return of the
notice the proximate cause is like saying when

you strike out, the only proximate cause is

strike two.

12

really make sense.

13

It just doesn't -- it doesn't

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what is your

14

standard of causation?

15

solely, it's not proximate cause.

16

thing I can think of that's left is but-for.

17

MR. SMITH:

It's not -- it's not
The only

I think that the -- the

18

analysis ought to use the -- be based on the

19

term "reason," not "cause," Your Honor.

20

not a -- this is not a tort law.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's the difference

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't understand why

22
23

It's

-­

24

it's just -- it's proximate cause, but both -­

25

strike one, strike two, strike three.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

They're

Official
70
1

all proximate causes of the strikeout.

2

MR. SMITH:

Well, I agree with that,

3

Your Honor, as well, Your Honor.

4

that that's not -- that's not the right way to

5

phrase -- way to think about it here.

6

I just think

The reason that they're being

7

identified as having moved is because they're

8

not voting.

9

That's the point.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in HAVA,

10

Congress used the term "solely."

11

something about -- about that provision of -­

12

of HAVA?

13

provisions.

14

Could you say

That says that states shall include
It's mandatory.

To have a system of file maintenance

15

that makes a reasonable effort to remove

16

ineligible voters, and goes on to say, under

17

this system, "registrants who have not

18

responded to a notice and who have not voted in

19

two consecutive general elections for Federal

20

office shall be removed from the official list

21

of eligible voters."

22
23
24
25

By itself, that seems pretty clear.
How do you get around that?
MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, I think

the except clause is a reference to the same

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

principle that's set forth in -- in (b)(2) -­

2

(b)(2), which is to say the reason that you're

3

getting put into the -- into the purge can't be

4

simply not voting.

5

goes on to say:

Right.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, under Ohio's

system, is someone removed solely because of

12

failure to vote?

13

MR. SMITH:

Yes, Your Honor.

Absolutely.
JUSTICE ALITO:

So the notices -­

16

there's no requirement -- if somebody doesn't

vote forever but returns that notice, the

18

person would be removed from the list?

about people who don't return the notice.

22

24
25

We're talking about people

JUSTICE ALITO:

The case is only

No, I understand that,

but I don't see how that -- how that's solely.
MR. SMITH:

Well, because the only

evidence that they have that you have moved,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
72

which is the permissible category, is your

2

non-voting.

3

it -- when it wrote that would have thought

4

that the -- the Supplemental Process removes

5

people solely for non-voting.

6

of the confirmation process as a reason to

7

remove people.

And so Congress, when it -- when

It didn't think

8

And it certainly didn't think

9

non-return of the notice was a reason to remove

10

people.

It was looking at -­

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

If somebody returns

12

the notice, they never vote, but they return

13

the notice, are they removed from the list?

14

MR. SMITH:

The notice -- when they

15

return the notice, the question is, what do

16

they say?

17

Street like I always have?

18

stay on the list.

19

Oklahoma, then they get purged.

20

Do they say I'm still living on Main
Then they -- they

If they say I have moved to

That -- that -- but in either event,

21

the state then has direct information about

22

where they live and can take whatever action it

23

should.

24
25

The -- the problem we have here is
that this kind of notice, which, by the way,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
73
1

says you don't have to return it, you can just

2

choose to vote sometime in the next four years,

3

most of the time isn't going to get returned.

4

And so it doesn't provide you any evidence at

5

all on which to decide that these people should

6

be purged.

7

looks an awful lot like the old Ohio use-it-or­

8

lose-it system, which is some period of

9

non-voting, one notice that most people don't

And you end up with a system which

10

return, and we're going to -- we're going to

11

throw you off the rolls.

12

Now, the other thing -- the other -­

13

other fact that's in the record is the small

14

number of people that were -- that the

15

Supplemental Process supposedly is trying to

16

find.

17

many people moved to a different county or

18

state in each year.

19

put in the record, Exhibit E to their main

20

brief in the district court.

21

about 3 percent of people in this country move

to a different county or state outside of the

Office.

tiny group of people which they then -- the

actually want to maintain adequate rolls rather

than just worry about the threat of getting

11

sued on the other side of the compromise that

12

is -- that is at issue here.

13

And I think this goes to that this, in

14

the end, was a -- a -- a statute that was

15

balancing competing purposes:

16

trying to remove ineligible voters, on the

17

other hand trying to ensure protections for

18

eligible voters.

19

On the one hand

And it came up with a compromise.

And

20

that compromise let a lot of room for states in

21

our federal system to adopt the procedures that

22

are best in that state.

23

And with respect to sending

24

information, I would say that my friend on the

25

other side mentioned the ERIC program.

of the 2016 election, Ohio sent something like

2

1.6 million letters to potentially eligible yet

3

unregistered voters, many of those if they were

removed under our process could have received

5

this notice from ERIC ahead of the registration

deadline encouraging them to register.

They get one notice, they're

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you answer

my question?

Are they ever sent, anyone who's

sent a notice and put on the inactive list, are

they ever again sent any voting information

outside of this ERIC program?

MR. MURPHY:

So Matt Damschroder's

declaration at Doc 38-2 suggested that the
