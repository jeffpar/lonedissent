ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. MESSENGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Abood should be overruled because it

13

failed to apply heightened First Amendment

14

scrutiny to a compulsory fee for speech to

15

influence governmental policies.

16

failure places it at odds with Harris, with

17

Knox, and a slew of other speech and

18

association precedents.

19

Abood's

Now Respondents attempt to justify

20

Abood's results with rationales found nowhere

21

in that decision, which undercuts any stare

22

decisis value in retaining Abood.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask,

24

Mr. Messenger, if you are right about agency

25

fees, what about three things:

One is student

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

activities fees.

2

so, why?

Another is mandatory bar association

3

payments.

And the third is you have a public

4

sector case.

5

agency fees compelled by state law in the

6

private sector?

7

Are they different and, if

What about the private sector,

MR. MESSENGER:

Yes, Your Honor.

With

8

respect to the first two instances, the student

9

association or student fees and the bar

10

association fees, those cases are

11

distinguishable for reasons stated in Harris.

12

They're justified by different interests.

13

The state bar associations are

14

justified by the state's compelling government

15

interest in regulating the practice of law

16

before its courts.

17

fees are justified by the government's or what

18

-- a university's compelling interest in

19

setting up a viewpoint-neutral forum for

20

speech.

21

The student association

And then, with respect to the private

22

sector cases, they hinge on a question of state

23

action.

24

union fees are being challenged.

25

private sector, you'd have a question of

So, in this case, only public sector

whether state action applied, and, therefore,

2

the rule of Janus would apply to that case.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, I

4

thought that we had always recognized that the

5

government as employer had a compelling

6

interest in regulating its employment

7

decisions.

8
9

We permit the government to fire
people, deprive them of all money, not just a

10

fair share fee, but deprive them of any income

11

if they speak outside of the government's

12

approved policy messages or messages generally.

13

So, if we can permit the government as

14

employer to have a compelling interest to do

15

something as dramatic as firing someone, why

16

can't that interest in having workplace peace,

17

workplace routine in which issues are decided

18

in a -- in a collective way, why isn't that a

19

compelling interest comparable to the others?

20

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, the government's

21

interests in restricting speech don't apply to

22

compelling support for speech.

23

oftentimes they cut the opposite way.

24
25

In fact,

So the government's interest in
restricting speech, for example, in the Hatch

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

Act, restricting political activities, was in

2

preventing the politicalization of the

3

workforce and preventing government employees

4

from being organized into a political machine.

5

Of course, those same interests don't

6

justify forcing individuals to support the

7

speech of an advocacy group.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's no

9

different than forcing student -- student

10

participation in fees to provide a public

11

forum, to have a bar association regulated.

12

These are all forcing the subsidization of

13

private interests for a government purpose.

14

And the government purpose here is labor

15

relations and labor peace.

16

still haven't told me why that's not a

17

compelling state interest.

18
19

MR. MESSENGER:

Why isn't -- you

The Court doesn't need to reach

whether or not labor peace into that -- such

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

interests are compelling because agency fees

2

are not a least restrictive means to satisfy

3

any labor peace interest the government may

4

have in listening to one union.

5

So the labor peace interest, as this

6

Court has explained in Abood, is the

7

government's interest in listening only to one

8

union so it doesn't have to listen to multiple

9

unions.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there's

11

another way of doing student fees.

12

have students who don't pay not participate in

13

any student activity because the price of -- of

14

being permitted to participate.

15

bar associations that the state runs.

16

have alternatives of all kinds, but the

17

question is, is the alternative that the state

18

has chosen one that is well-fitted to the -- to

19

its need?

20

tailored?

21

You can

I don't see how you can do that given

22

the interests of the government in ensuring

that unions represent everybody.

Well, an agency fee

isn't necessary for exclusive representation.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why not?

3

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, the reason, Your

4

Honor, is exclusive representation in and of

5

itself is a valuable benefit for a union.

6

provides unions with extraordinary powers to

7

compel the government to listen to it at the

8

bargaining table, to not listen to other

9

advocacy groups.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

But it drains it of

11

resources that make it an equal partner in the

12

marketing setting.

13

not only the people who are opposed to the

14

union but also union supporters who may think

15

I'd rather keep the money in my own pocket, and

16

then you'll have a union with diminished

17

resources, not able to investigate what it

18

should demand at the bargaining table, not

19

equal to the employer that it faces.

20
21

If you are right, that it's

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, I think there's

two things in that question, Your Honor.

22

The first, the question is, does the

23

duty to represent nonmembers raise union bar -­

24

bargaining costs?

25

not.

And I submit that it does

The union -- there's no reason why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

negotiating a contract for all employees in a

2

unit would be more expensive than negotiating a

3

contract just for the union members, because

4

the union's discretion in bargaining is

5

incredibly wide.

6

union has to the nonmembers, which it assumes

7

over them by assuming exclusive representative

8

authority, doesn't necessarily add any costs

9

confer.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you're not

taking into account what I -­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Have the unions -­

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- I suggested,

15

that it's not just the people who oppose the

16

union, but the people who support the union but

17

say we have a chance to get out of paying fees

18

to the union, and so, although not for

19

ideological reasons, we're going to pass and

20

we're not going to pay dues either.

21

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, I submit, Your

22

Honor, it's immaterial why an individual does

not wish to support union advocacy.

4

resources available to them could be

5

substantially diminished?

6

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, to -- to the

7

degree to which the union resources are

8

diminished by individuals exercising their

9

First Amendment right not to subsidize that

10

union, I submit that's a perfectly acceptable

11

result.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does -- does the

13

Constitution require states to demand that

14

unions provide services for nonmembers?

15

For example, is there a constitutional

16

requirement for a union to handle the

17

grievances of nonmembers, or is that something

18

that's imposed by state law?

MR. MESSENGER:

It varies, Your Honor.

In the federal law, this Court implied the duty

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, no, we're

talking about state law.
MR. MESSENGER:

Yes.

In state law,

for example, in Illinois state law, there is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

provision in the Illinois Labor Relations Act

2

that expressly provides a duty of fair

3

representation.

required?

Yeah, I understand

Are they -- is that constitutionally

7

MR. MESSENGER:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

No, Your Honor.
With reference to

some of the other cases they've discussed, has

10

-- have the unions at any point in this

11

litigation or any point in their history ever

12

said that they're committed to the -- to the

13

idea of viewpoint neutrality?

14

MR. MESSENGER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, Your Honor.
I wonder, since your

16

time is limited, I -- let me say three -- three

17

quick questions.

18

What you're doing basically is trying

19

to apply a more modern framework to some older

20

cases.

This has been the law for 50 years just

21

about.

Okay?

22

Holmes and Brandeis didn't know about

23

these modern framework.

How many cases should

24

we go back?

25

modern frameworks to all old cases, begin with

Do you think we should apply

all kinds of older cases where we haven't

4

5

There are lots of very
They will think of

So, one, what's your limiting

6

principle there?

7

principle on the matter that we're talking

8

about?

9

Two, what is your limiting

I mean, Stewart, Justice Stewart, who

10

wrote Abood in the '70s, thought the case is

11

identical or near identical to the Railway

12

Labor Act cases.

13

railroad, they're regulated, government's

14

involved, just as your clients are involved,

15

you know, just as the unions here.

16
17
18

Railway Labor Act, that's a

What's the distinction, if you're
going to try to make one?
And -- and -- and -- and really,

19

three, and this is for all of you, all the

20

lawyers here, what do you think of the -- what

21

I think of as a compromise put forth by

22

Justices Kennedy, Scalia, Souter, and O'Connor

23

in Lehnert, called to our attention

24

specifically by the brief of Professor Fried

25

and Professor Post?

Does that solve most of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1
2

your problem for any side?
Those are the three.

You see?

Stare

3

decisis, even if it weren't there, how do you

4

distinguish all the other unions, particularly

5

those in regulated industries, and, three, what

6

about the compromise?

7

MR. MESSENGER:

Yes.

So, to address

8

your questions in order, Justice Breyer, on the

9

first point, Abood is not only inconsistent

10

with cases that came after it; it was

11

inconsistent with cases that came before it,

12

such as Elrod.

13

Justice Powell would have applied exacting

14

First Amendment scrutiny to patronage.

Even the dissent in Elrod,

15

So Abood wasn't just a departure -- or

16

isn't just inconsistent with prior precedent or

17

-- sorry, subsequent precedents, but with the

18

precedents that came before it.

19

not necessarily be solely applying a new

20

doctrine to Abood but applying what the law was

21

even prior to Abood.

22

So this would

With the Railway Labor Act, as this

23

Court explained in Harris, there you have the

24

private sector.

25

dealing with government, which, of course, is

You don't have the union

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

political advocacy, and that political advocacy

2

is subject to heightened First Amendment

3

protection, which you don't necessarily have in

4

the private sector.

5

And then, with respect to the third

6

point, the test suggested in the dissent in

7

Lehnert, the problem with that is that it

8

allowed for charging of collective bargaining

9

and anything else that the government decided

10
11

that the union had a duty to bargain over.
So, in other words, that test, the

12

statutory duties test, allows the government to

13

decide what is constitutionally chargeable

14

under the First Amendment.

15

So that test would, of course, among

16

other things, allow for charging of collective

17

bargaining.

18

the core political activity, which we submit

19

individuals cannot be compelled to support.

20

But here collective bargaining is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it just the

21

collective nature of the union?

You're not

22

suggesting that if an employee goes to the

23

state and tries to negotiate his or her wages

24

that that's a First Amendment activity.

25

said it's not, right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We've

9

malfeasance, that's an employment-related issue

MR. MESSENGER:

employees come to the union -- come to the

14

state and want greater training, employment

15

issue, correct?

16

MR. MESSENGER:

Generally, yes.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why does it

18

transform into some entitlement to First

19

Amendment protection merely because a

20

collective body of employees are coming to the

21

table at once?

22

transformative nature now of making these

23

substantive questions matters of public policy?

24
25

What -- what's the

MR. MESSENGER:

As this Court

recognized in Harris, it's the scale.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So here

Official
17

you have AFSCME bargaining over issues that

2

affect hundreds of millions of dollars and

3

affect thousands of employees across the board.

4

The scale of that is what makes it a political

5

--

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's not going to

7

change whether the union asks for it or the

8

employees come -- what you're now saying is if

9

the employees came into an auditorium at a

10

business site of the state and every one of

11

them got up and said, I want higher wages, the

12

scale of that demand makes it protected by the

13

First Amendment?

14

demand.

15

It's still a work-related

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, in that

16

hypothetical, it would arguably be a matter of

public concern if there was a stage-in, you

18

know, at a public auditorium in which employees

19

stood up.

2

something that every employee wants, they've

3

now articulated?

4

MR. MESSENGER:

I would submit that it

5

starts to move towards a matter of public

6

policy if it isn't entirely.

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's now scale,

not subject?

9

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, it's both scale

10

and subject.

I mean, here the subject are

11

wages, health insurance, many ways in which the

12

government operates which are very important

13

both to the public fisc and to the operation

14

and delivery of services.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Scale -­

Mr. Messenger, may I

17

ask you about reliance interests here?

18

think that we have ever overruled a case where

19

reliance interests are remotely as strong as

20

they are here.

21

I don't

So just a few things to put on the

22

table.

Twenty-three states, the District of

23

Columbia, Puerto Rico, all would have their

24

statutes declared unconstitutional at once.

25

Thousands of municipalities would have

Official

contracts invalidated.

2

probably cover millions, maybe up to over 10

3

million, workers.

4

Those contracts

So property and contract rights, the

6

and the livelihoods of millions of individuals

affected all at once.

8
9
10

When have we ever done something like
that?

doing something like that?

11
12

What would be the justification for

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, I'd say two

things, Justice Kagan.

13

The first is that the prevalence of

14

these compulsory unionism provisions isn't

15

reason for retaining Abood; it's reason for

16

reversing Abood.

17

Amendment violations, as you said, in 23 states

18

--

19

You have wide-scale First

But that would be to

MR. MESSENGER:

-- affected -­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- flip our usual

23

stare decisis doctrine.

25

reliance is an important consideration on the

20

-­

Our usual stare

scales.

2

MR. MESSENGER:

Reliance on something

3

that's constitutional.

4

practice, no.

5

which involved searches of cars under the

6

Fourth Amendment, the Court said the fact this

7

was occurring in many places across the board

8

is a reason for reversing it, and many

9

individuals' Fourth Amendment rights were being

10

Reliance on an illegal

For example, in Arizona v. Gant,

violated.

11

And so, in that instance, the

12

prevalence of compulsory unionism in the states

13

is a reason for reversing it.

14

And then, in terms of contracts in

15

general, I submit the contracts will survive,

16

except for the excision of the compulsory

17

unionism provisions due to severability.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, why is that?

19

How many of these contracts have severability

20

clauses, do you know?

21

MR. MESSENGER:

I couldn't find a

22

number for the public sector, Your Honor, but

23

the general -- most contracts, at least I have

24

seen for anecdotal, do have severability

25

clauses and the general rule under the

opposite.

there.

I mean, California has a whole brief

You've read that.
MR. MESSENGER:

Of course, yes, Your

Honor.

7
8

California says the

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what's the answer

to that?

9

MR. MESSENGER:

The answer, Your

10

Honor, is that I submit they're severable in

11

California because they're not an essential

12

provision of the contract that would require

13

the excision of anything more than the clause.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

that's true, presumably they're bargained-for

20

The contract would have been

So to leave the contract as is, except

for one particular bargained-for provision, is

to do something that's inequitable for the

24
25

MR. MESSENGER:

Well, I don't think

that's necessarily always true as a legal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22

matter.

Foremost in some states, compulsory

2

unionism is mandated by the statute, for

3

example, in California.

4

once the provision is there, it stays there, so

5

it's not even a subject of bargaining usually.

6

It's something that was always there from the

7

prior contract.

8
9

And in other states,

It's taken as an assumption.

And even to the extent it was a
bargained-for issue in a recent contract, these

10

contracts will expire the next one to three

11

years and need to be renegotiated anyways.

12

I don't think that really changes the reliance

13

interests.

the remainder of my time.

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

GENERAL FRANCISCO:
and may it please the Court:

24
25

Mr. Chief Justice,

I'd like to focus on three basic
issues.

The first is the government's interest

Heritage Reporting Corporation

in having a necessity of agency fees.

2

second is the stare decisis question that we've

necessary to further the compelling interest in

8

on the other side of the table, I don't think

there's really any basis for concluding that.

10

For example, in the federal government, we

don't have agency fees either in the government

generally or under the -­

Well, two

First, the Postal

And in the rest of the federal

10

government, I would submit that the more

11

limited bargaining range should make it harder

12

for them to recruit members into the union.

13

And, in fact, in the Postal Service,

14

according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data,

15

we find that about 94 percent of employees who

16

are subject to collective bargaining agreements

17

are members of the union even though you don't

18

have agency fees.

19

generally, including the Postal Service, that

20

number is about 80 percent.

21

take the federal -- the Postal Service out and

22

look at the federal government, it's still

23

north of 80 percent.

the federal government generally, about a

quarter of the workplace, a quarter to a third

12

You -- you were

So my other

point was on the motion to dismiss issue, the

course is, as in Harris, you reverse the motion

particularly the reliance interests, collective

20

bargaining agreements are generally two- to

21

four-year contracts.

22

all of them were negotiated under the shadow of

23

Harris and Knox.

24

was an enormous amount of reliance on the

25

continued vitality of Abood.

So that means that almost

So I don't think that there

2

I think it would be very short-lived, until the

next negotiating session, where any new

decisions from this Court would be factored in.

5

And I do agree that there also probably

6

wouldn't be much disruption at all since you

7

would simply invalidate individual agency fee

8

provisions.

9

Now -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Francisco,

10

I would like to get your answer to the question

11

I asked Mr. Messenger and didn't have time to

12

ask him a follow-up.

13

Let's say you prevail in this case.

14

What happens in the private sector?

We have a

15

doctrine you know well, Shelley against

16

Kraemer, that says if a contract is illegal,

17

the court can't enforce it.

18

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

19

Respectfully, Your Honor, I don't think

20

anything would happen in the private sector for

21

largely the reasons that Justice Alito

22

identified in his Third Circuit opinion on the

23

issue and the D.C. Circuit identified in an

24

opinion that I -- I believe you were part of,

8

heard Archie Cox, maybe it was in your position

9

right here, say the greatest instrument for

labor peace and prosperity from the years 1945

unions.

13

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

And not all workers

And all they've seen is that this

24

of the financing of a system that at least in

25

some aspects, though it's debatable, some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

people think it brought labor peace.

Now, you are the

government of the United States.

6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

What do you

Well, Your Honor,

7

I think that the core of this issue goes to -­

8

and I'm reading from the agency brief -- the

9

agency fee provision itself, the cost of the

10

collective bargaining process.

11

And that's separate from the grievance

12

process.

I actually think the grievance

13

process raises serious First Amendment concerns

14

as well.

15

focus is on the cost of collective bargaining,

16

and I don't think you necessarily have to go

17

any further than that to resolve this case,

18

since the whole -­

But for purposes of this case, the

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Please.

20

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

-- since the whole

21

idea of agency fees, their justification and

22

their purpose, has been predicated on the -­

23

the need to compel support for the collective

24

bargaining process.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, an important

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

part of Mr. Messenger's argument is the idea

2

that all speech about employment conditions,

3

about pay, about vacation, you know, about all

4

of the various employee benefits that -- that

5

are subjects of collective bargaining, that are

6

really the heart of collective bargaining, that

7

all speech about that is -- are matters of

8

public concern when it happens in the public

9

workplace because they all cost money and, as

10

taxpayers, we would be interested in things

11

that cost money.

12

position as well, that all of that speech is a

13

matter of public concern?

14

Is that the government's

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes, Your Honor.

15

I think in the public bargaining context, all

16

of it goes to the size, structure, cost of

17

government, and the delivery of public

18

services, although I would agree that there are

19

some things that more vividly implicate public

20

policy than others.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I ask -- I -- it

22

strikes me as a very unusual position for the

23

government to be taking, looking after the

24

long-term interests of the United States

25

government, because essentially what that means

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31

is that you will have to litigate all

2

employee/employer disputes under the -­

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

-- second step of

Pickering rather than under the first -­

6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well -­

-- which is quite a

8

striking thing for the government to be saying

9

that it agrees with.

10

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yeah.

Well, I -­

11

I very much disagree with that, Your Honor.

12

think the Pickering framework is an established

13

framework that works very well, and the nature

14

of individual wage disputes, the reason it

15

rises to the level of public interest when it

16

comes to collective bargaining agreements is

17

because it really does all go to the overall

18

size, structure, and the cost of the

19

government.

20

I

Pickering is very different.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So you're saying that

21

when a union collectively bargains, it's a

22

matter of public concern but that if employees

23

in their workplace, 10 or 20 of them, get

24

together without the formal collective

25

bargaining that a union does, that that's not a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

matter of public concern?

2

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Very much so, Your

3

Honor, because when an individual employee is

4

negotiating with his employer over his

5

particular wage, that's a negotiation that's

6

taking place between the employee and the

7

employer.

8
9

In the public sector collective
bargaining context, it's taking place between a

10

private third-party organization, a union, and

11

the government in order to set the overall

12

size, scope, and structure of government.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that union is a

14

representative of the employees and has been

15

chosen to represent the employees so that the

16

employees can better wield their power -­

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

And -­

-- over terms and

19

conditions of employment.

So why should it

20

matter -- I mean, that's -- I'm -- I'm trying

21

to understand this because it struck me as a

22

quite amazing thing -­

23

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Yeah.

-- for the government

to be saying that these were matters of public

concern.

2

get together and say we want higher wages and

3

then, on the other hand, if employees get

4

together and say, you know what, we think it's

5

right to elect a union so that the union can

6

say that, it's the exact same subjects and the

7

exact same speech that's going to be involved.

8
9

Why should it matter if 50 employees

GENERAL FRANCISCO:
matters for two reasons:

One is the scope of

10

the issue.

11

it's the nature of Pickering.

12

And I think it

But, two, and more importantly,

Even in Pickering, the government is

13

allowed to prohibit core political speech when

14

it interferes with the employee's ability to do

15

their job.

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And that's the -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we're going to

20

the employee who, contrary to the chain of

command, talks about rampant corruption in a

government agency, then we're not going to

MR. FRANKLIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

This Court's cases uniformly recognize

2

that the state has a much freer hand when it

3

manages its personnel as an employer than when

4

it regulates its citizens as a sovereign, and

5

this has come up already today, that freer hand

6

includes broad authority to put conditions on

7

employees' speech.

8
9

Now my friends on the other side this
morning argue that that deference to the

10

employer's prerogatives somehow depends on the

11

scale or the scope of the speech in question.

12

That has never been the law.

The government is still acting as an

14

employer when it treats with its employees as a

15

group or as a whole.

17

other deferential public employee tests to

18

uphold generally applicable workplace policies.

19

7

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, first of all, we

8

don't know what percentage of the union's

9

activities are wrapped up with grievances.

If

10

you -- you know, we don't have a record here.

11

We're on a motion to dismiss.

12

But if you look at publicly available

13

Hudson notices that do break out categories of

14

chargeable expenses in this way, which ours in

15

the record doesn't happen to do, you'll find

16

that in many cases, especially in the out-years

17

when the CBA is not being renegotiated, charges

18

for field representatives -- those are the

19

people in -- day in and day out who are doing

20

workplace grievance work, advising employees,

21

et cetera -- can be three times, six times,

22

seven times as much on the chargeable expenses

23

line than the line for collective bargaining.

evidentiary vacuum on the basis of assumptions

leverage -- leverages that relationship in such

that that was a matter of -- that was a -- that

22

was a subject of private concern.

23

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, it's possible

24

that if you've got an Orwellian scenario where

25

the employee is being required in the workplace

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

to speak about matters of public concern, we

2

would get to step 2.

3
4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Private concern.

Private concern.

5

MR. FRANKLIN:

What we wouldn't get to

6

is strict scrutiny then.

7

the Petitioner wants to vault over all of the

8

break points in this Court's First Amendment

9

law with respect to public employees and go

10

The -- the -- the -­

straight to strict scrutiny.

11

And the fact is this Court has never

12

applied strict scrutiny to a condition of

13

public employment that was backed by a bona

14

fide interest that the state has as an

15

employer.

16

Never, not once.
And I'm happy to talk about the -- the

17

political affiliation cases, because I don't

18

think they are to the contrary.

19

So, you know, implicit, I think, in

20

your question, Justice Alito, was the

21

distinction that my friend tried to draw

22

between compulsion and restriction.

23

Court has said again and again in Wooley, in

24

Riley, and elsewhere, that compulsion and

25

restriction of speech are two sides of the same

But this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43

coin.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, then why won't

3

you answer my question about what the assistant

4

district attorney could be required to do?

5

Throughout history, many people have

6

drawn a line between a restriction on their

7

speech and compelled speech.

8

I'll give you an example that's only

9

-- that's quite different given the nature of

10

the -- of the subject from what's involved

11

here.

12

Do you remember the -- the -- the

13

movie and the play "A Man For All Seasons"?

14

Thomas More didn't insist on saying that he

15

thought the act of supremacy was wrong, but he

16

drew a line and paid for it with his life when

17

-- because he would not affirmatively say that

18

it was wrong.

19

When you compel somebody to speak,

20

don't you infringe that person's dignity and

21

conscience in a way that you do not when you

22

restrict what the person says?

23

So

MR. FRANKLIN:

You do, Your Honor, in

24

some circumstances.

But what we're talking

25

about here is a compelled payment of a fee.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

Official
44
1

it's one step removed from compelled speech.

2

And I don't want to disparage the

3

First Amendment interests that are at issue

4

here.

5

seriously.

6

that agency fees are not "A Man for All

7

Seasons" scenario by any stretch.

8

--

9
10

Abood recognized them.

We take them

But it's important to recognize

JUSTICE ALITO:

They don't

No, they're not a -­

it's not "A Man for All Seasons" scenario.

11

MR. FRANKLIN:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.
But I'm just asking

13

you about the point whether you think that

14

compelling somebody to speak is exactly the

15

same thing as saying you may not speak?

16
17

MR. FRANKLIN:

No, it's not exactly

the same, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

MR. FRANKLIN:

No.
The Pickering balance

20

could come out differently in certain

21

instances.

22

I would grant you that.

I do think, not to use Garcetti again,

23

but if Mr. Ceballos had been required to write

24

a disposition memo and had said I won't do it,

25

as opposed to what actually happened, which was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

that he wrote one and was disciplined for what

2

was in it, nothing about the logic or the

3

outcome would change.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, what is

5

there -- what is there about compelled speech?

6

I mean, our line has drawn a big difference

7

between compelled speech and compelled subsidy.

8

10
11

MR. FRANKLIN:
Justice Sotomayor.

I agree with that,

I mean, if you look at the

cases -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and we've

12

compelled people to pay bar associations so

13

long as you're not compelled or stopped from

14

speaking when you disagree.

15

a compelled subsidy.

16

MR. FRANKLIN:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We've said that's

And all -­
Bar members can

18

come out any day they want and say they don't

19

take the same position on a policy question as

20

the bar association.

to get up publicly in any setting he or she

22

wants to say they don't agree with the position

23

the union is taking, correct?

24
25

Any union member is free

MR. FRANKLIN:

Correct.

And all of

those cases, Keller, Southworth, Glickman, were

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

outside of the workplace context, where the

2

state has always been recognized to have

3

paramount interests in ensuring that its

4

managerial prerogatives can be carried out.

5

You know, the state's interest here,

6

if I can spend just a few moments talking about

7

that, is, first, we have an interest in dealing

8

with a single spokesman for the -- for the

9

employees.

Second, we have an interest in

10

imposing on that spokesman a legal duty to

11

represent everyone.

12

But as -- as regards agency fees, they

13

are complementary to those first two interests.

14

They serve our managerial interests in two

ways.

situation where some employees bear the cost of

17

representing others who contribute nothing.

18

That kind of two-tiered workplace would be

19

corrosive to our ability to cultivate

20

collaboration, cohesion, good working

21

relationships among our personnel.

22

First, they allow us to avoid a

23

an interest at the end of the day in being able

7

higher wages, for massive government, for

8

increasing bonded indebtedness, for increasing

9

taxes?

10
11
12
13

That's -- that's the interest the state

has?
MR. FRANKLIN:

No.

The -- the state

has no interest or no overriding interest -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Doesn't it -­

14

doesn't it -- doesn't it blink reality to deny

15

that that is what's happening here?

16

MR. FRANKLIN:

We -- with all due

17

respect, Justice Kennedy, we've never denied

18

that many of the topics that come up at the

19

bargaining table with public employee unions

20

have serious fiscal and public policy

21

implications.

22
23
24
25

We've never denied that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So what

about the compromise?
MR. FRANKLIN:

The -- the line that

Justice Scalia drew in his Lehnert separate

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

opinion was, in our view, superior to the one

2

that was drawn by the plurality.

3

We've offered a test for where to draw

4

the line between chargeable and non-chargeable

5

expenses that, in practice, would overlap with,

6

would coincide with, Justice Scalia's line in

7

most cases, but the reason that we think that

8

it's superior to the plurality's line is that

9

the germaneness test does have a vagueness

10

problem and in -- in some instances, it allows

11

what it shouldn't allow, which is, for

12

chargeability, for speech to the government as

13

a sovereign.

14

be drawn there.

15

And we think a very firm line can

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -- Mr. Franklin,

16

Mr. Messenger has suggested, and -- and -- and

17

General Francisco, that if we overruled Abood,

18

things would in a few years get back to normal.

19

The state would pass a new statute, and these

20

municipal contracts would all be renegotiated,

21

and it wouldn't be any real issue.

22

So could you -- what do you think

23

about that?

What would the difficulties be, if

24

any, if the state -- if -- if the Court were to

25

overrule Abood?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

MR. FRANKLIN:

I'm happy to speak to

2

that, Justice Kagan.

3

obviously, we're on a motion to dismiss, but

4

more broadly, what we know is that tangibly,

5

when these kinds of obligations of financial

6

support become voluntary, union membership goes

7

down, union density rates go down, union

8

resources go down.

9

again.

10
11

Here's what we know, and,

We've seen it again and

Mancur Olson spoke about it in the

foundational text of behavioral economics.
We also know that, intangibly, there

12

are plenty of studies that show that when

13

unions are deprived of agency fees, they tend

14

to become more militant, more confrontational,

15

they go out in search of short-term gains that

16

they can bring back to their members and say

17

stick with us.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the

19

argument on the other side, of course, is that

20

the need to attract voluntary payments will

21

make the unions more efficient, more effective,

22

more attractive to a broader group of their

23

employees.

What's wrong with that?

24

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, two things that

25

-- that I would say about that.

First, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

studies that I've read indicate that, yes,

2

there can be an initial first flush of

3

mobilization and organizing when something like

4

this gets taken away, but that over the long

5

term, human nature and basic economics dictate

6

that the free-rider problem will become endemic

7

and, not only that, but contagious, because if

8

I'm an employee and I stick with the union and

9

others over time decide not to, my fees and my

10

dues are going to go up and up and up and the

11

pressure on me to make the same choice will

12

increase as well.

13

But the other point I'd make would be

14

a legal point.

15

for example, in the Connick case that there

16

ought to be judicial deference to the

17

predictive judgments about workplace harm and

18

that in particular -- this is a quote from

19

Connick -- "we do not see the necessity for an

20

employer to allow events to unfold to the

21

extent" that the destruction of working

22

relationships has to be manifest before the

23

state can take prophylactic action to stop it.

24
25

You know, this Court has said,

This is an area, Your Honor, where not
only has this Court -- we're, of course, aware

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51

this Court has addressed this topic three times

2

in the past, what, four years, but also the

3

people around the country are addressing this

4

issue in a very visible and sustained way.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -- Mr. Franklin, I

6

mean, you just addressed what you considered to

7

be the harmful effects of a different rule, but

8

I was trying to get at a slightly different

9

question.

I was asking you, even beyond that,

10

what are the effects on -- given that this rule

11

has been in place for so long?

12

MR. FRANKLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. FRANKLIN:

15

We do think the reliance interests are

severability clause, there would be state law

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

3

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT AFSCME COUNCIL 31

4
5
6

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
I would note at the beginning that all

7

of these arguments were before the Court 40

8

years ago in Abood.

9

unanimously upheld the idea of agency fees, it

And when the Court

10

considered whether or not these issues would

11

constrain the constitutional prerogatives of

12

government to act under democratic impulses to

13

come up with a system that would fit the local

14

culture, history, private sector background of

15

what state governments were having to do to

16

recruit and attract the most willing and able

17

people to discharge the public services that

18

public employees are required to perform.

19

So, when this Court addressed in

20

Lehnert the question of how do you draw the

21

line between those fees that are deemed to be

22

ideological and those that are deemed to be

23

part of a statutorily mandated process, the

24

Court cleaved, and the question of whether or

25

not the statute mandated, as it does here,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

exclusive representation and the union is

2

required to represent the minority members,

3

what Justice Scalia said was it is fair to

4

assign a fee for the services that the union by

5

statute is required to provide.

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what if the

7

statute -- what if a state statute says that

8

lobbying is a man -- is a mandatory subject of

9

bargaining?

10

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, I -- I think

11

that the question -- I guess, what do you mean

12

by lobbying, Justice Alito?

13

exactly what you mean.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm not sure

Well, there's no -- is

15

there any limit on what states can make a

16

mandatory subject of collective bargaining?

17

if the test is whether it's -- whether the -­

18

it's mandated by the -- by the state, the state

19

can make anything it wants a mandatory subject

20

of bargaining.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

So

Justice Alito, I would

22

say that that hypothetical is so far outside of

23

what this case is really all about that if you

24

think that there's a problem, that if any state

25

ever in the union would come up with some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

requirement like that as part of collective

2

bargaining, you have the opportunity to review

3

it at this time.

4

But what we're talking about here is a

5

system that is well-settled within the states

6

to allow for this kind of dynamic interchange

7

for the benefit of management.

that this case affects the political influence

influence will be exactly the same as it was

before, if this case comes out against us?

of our sovereign system, have the authority and

9

the prerogative to set up a collective

The question is:

Do states, as part

bargaining system in which they mandate that

11

the union is going to represent minority

12

interests on pain of being subject with -- to

13

any fair labor practice.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And in which they

15

mandate people that object to certain union

16

policies to pay for the implementation of those

17

policies against their First Amendment

18

interests?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Kennedy, I

20

would ask you to read Justice Harlan's opinion

21

in Lathrop where he addressed every single one

22

of those considerations.

(Laughter.)

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. FREDERICK:

It's a wonderful -­

2

it's a wonderful opinion, because what he says

3

is that the -- what he says is that the

4

subsidization goes to the purpose of the

5

organization, here that is state-mandated

6

collective bargaining, and in which the person

7

who doesn't agree with the positions basically

8

gets two cracks.

9

One is to try to persuade the group

10

that he's right and, if that doesn't fail, he

18

something I thought I would never see in a

19

brief filed by a public employee union, and

20

that is the argument that the original meaning

21

of the Constitution is that public employees

22

have no free speech rights.

23

Where do you want us to go with that?

24

MR. FREDERICK:

Well -­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Should -- should we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

adopt that rule?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

-- what I would say is

3

that what this Court, Justice White's opinion

4

in Connick, explains that if you look at this

5

from a question of what are the three choices

6

before you, at the origins, there were no

7

rights.

8
9

What they are asking for is basically
unfettered First Amendment for public servants,

10

and what Justice White explained was that, as

11

the First Amendment evolved, there were

12

limitations on what the government could do

13

with respect to certain expression, but the

14

core principle, from the founding to today, is

15

that government has a free rein in regulating

16

expressive rights in its workplace.

17

That principle from the founding to

18

today is at stake here because what they are

19

saying is that every grievance, every

20

employment issue, becomes a constitutional

21

issue.

22

says, of course, you can't run government if

23

that becomes the principle -­

24
25

And Justice White's opinion in Connick

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think that's a

fair characterization of their argument?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

MR. FREDERICK:

I do think that it is

2

a fair characterization insofar as what they

3

say is the collective bargaining issues that

4

are in the contract are all raising matters of

5

public concern.

6

You could look at them.

They are

7

talking about who gets assignments on holidays?

8

What are leave policies all about?

do not affect the public fisc at all but go to

budget?

18

MR. FREDERICK:

Your Honor, what

19

essentially happens, as I understand it, is

20

that either the budget is set and the

21

negotiation occurs within that parameter, or

22

the governor takes the collective bargaining

23

agreement to the state and the legislature

24

decides to either ratify it or not.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So the public

to the state budget to the extent that impacts

different states the system works differently.

bargaining happens, and sometimes the

bargaining happens and, if the legislature

7

doesn't think it fits within the budget, they

say we're not going -- going to ratify this or

we're going to ratify the budget, you go back

and renegotiate this to make it fit.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Frederick, if I

understood General Francisco's argument, it's

that speech as to matters of pay and benefits

14

and employment conditions and so forth are

matters of public concern when they are

addressed in a collective bargaining framework

23

case of this Court that hinges the First

24

Amendment prerogatives of the government on the

25

scope or manner of the speech with respect to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

that.

2

And, in fact, as my colleague said,

3

when this Court upheld the Hatch Act, that

4

applied to all workers.

5

Court applied Pickering balancing to say that

6

the government interest was sufficient to

7

outweigh the restrictions on the employee's

8

speech.

9

And the -- and the

And the Court also did the same thing.

10

It applied the same Pickering balance when it

11

decided that it was constitutional to have

12

exclusive representation.

13

speech of the minority to the exclusion of the

14

majority.

15

That quelled the

So these are all broad-sweep,

16

broad-scope principles where this Court has

17

applied Pickering.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if one employee

19

says I deserve a 5 percent raise, is that a

20

matter of public concern or private concern?

21

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, it depends on

22

whether it affects the morale of the workplace,

23

as Justice White's opinion in Connick said.

24

There may be a circumstance, you look at the

25

balancing, and you look at the content and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

context in which that speech arises.

2

So that, for instance, in Connick,

3

what the Court said, the only thing that was a

4

matter of public concern there was whether it

5

affected the morale of the workplace.

6

Court said on the basis of that, it could be a

7

matter of public concern, but an individual

8

worker's agitation ordinarily for pay would not

9

raise a matter of public concern.

10

And the

That would

be classic government workplace speech.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

So, if

12

that's a matter of private concern, if the

13

union demands a 5 percent wage increase for all

14

of the -- the employees it represents, can that

15

be a matter of public concern?

16
17

MR. FREDERICK:

I don't think so

because -­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

It can't?

No?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

No, because what the

20

-- what is happening in a negotiation, of

21

course, this is a closed universe, your

22

hypothetical posits the opening bid by the

23

union.

24
25

And -- and it's important to keep in
mind the content and context of that speech.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

All negotiations between workers and management

2

do not take place in a public forum.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what -- what if the

4

effect of the 5 percent wage increase across

5

the board would push a city to the brink and

6

perhaps over the brink into bankruptcy.

7

it then become a matter of public concern?

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

Would

Well, I think that you

would look at that in terms of the context of

10

the particular scenario.

11

there are briefs on our side that make this

12

very clear -- that that particular

13

hypothetical, in fact, is an unfair smearing of

14

the -- of the collective bargaining process.

15

I would say -- and

But what I would also point out is

16

that if management says we cannot pay for this,

17

and, therefore, there is no agreement, there

18

are state-mandated procedures to determine

19

whether one side is bargaining in good faith or

20

not.

21

that is not a good-faith position, it can be

22

subject to a state penalty.

23

And if the union is taking a position

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so I don't see

24

how you can say, if one person asks for more

25

money, that affects the budget.

If one person

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

in the railroads asks for more money, that

2

affects the rates that a public body, the

3

Interstate Commerce Commission, used to have to

4

set.

5

electricity company, asks for money, that

6

affects the electricity rate.

7

If one person in a public utility, an

So the line can't be, I would think,

8

whether or not you're asking for higher wages,

9

whether collectively or individually, because

10
11

they all affect the budget.
So then what is the line?

I had

12

thought the line was wages, hours, working

13

conditions is okay, and if it's not okay, then

14

that goes way beyond just public employees,

15

doesn't it?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

And I would note

17

that Justice Powell even had no problem in

18

Abood with the wages/hours formulation and he

19

was the one who disagreed with the basic

20

formulation.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well,

22

hypotheticals are asked to address a principle

23

that can then be expanded.

24

doesn't affect wages, do -- does 20 percent of

25

the workforce affect wages -- I mean negotiate

If one employee

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

or demands with respect to wages affect the

2

public policy concerns that go into how much of

3

a budget, as to which there are many competing

4

demands, is allocated to employees?

5

MR. FREDERICK:

Your Honor, the

6

question -- I'll -- I'll concede you that there

7

are certain matters in collective bargaining

8

that might raise matters of public concern.

9

But what the Court's cases say is that, even if

10

there is a matter of public concern, the

11

government has the adequate power to restrict

12

that speech if it can show there's

13

justification.

14

And Justice Scalia's opinion in

15

Lehnert provides the compelling interest by

16

saying that the state is mandated that the

17

union be the exclusive represent -­

18

representative and must conduct itself through

19

a duty of fair representation.

20

where you get the compelling interest in agency

21

fees.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that's

Well, the germaneness

23

rule came out of Abood itself and it was

24

fleshed out in Lehnert.

25

asking -- you're suggesting we should overrule

So do you -- are you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

Abood in part?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

No.

What I'm

3

suggesting is that if you were to go to this

4

line, you should consider revisiting Lehnert.

5

That's not a question of Abood's basic

6

correctness.

7
8

Abood has been foundational precedent
--

9
10

And didn't Abood talk

MR. FREDERICK:

-- in a lot of

--

11
12

JUSTICE ALITO:

different areas.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

talk about germaneness?

15

MR. FREDERICK:

Didn't Abood draw -­

I think Abood used the

16

word germaneness.

17

give content to that because what Abood simply

18

said was it is constitutional for this to

19

happen.

20

But what Lehnert did was to

Now I'd like to turn to the reliance

21

interest because, if the other side succeeds in

22

persuading a majority of you to overrule Abood,

23

it will affect thousands of contracts and, more

24

importantly, it is going to affect the work of

25

state legislatures, city councils, school

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
68
1

districts, who are going to have to go back to

2

the drawing board in deciding what are the

3

rules for negotiating and how that works.

4

And what that means is that the key

5

thing that has been bargained for in this

6

contract for agency fees is a -- a limitation

7

on striking.

8

collective bargaining agreements.

9

And that is true in many

The fees are the tradeoff.

Union

10

security is the tradeoff for no strikes.

11

so, if you were to overrule Abood, you can

12

raise an untold specter of labor unrest

13

throughout the country.

14

Thank you.

Thank you,

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. MESSENGER

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20

MR. MESSENGER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

21

just to pick up on the last point made, the

22

proposition that agency fees are the costs that

23

employees have to pay to prevent unions from

24

striking, I submit is not only extremely

25

attenuated, but also would make agency fees

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
69
1

effectively a form of protection money, the

2

idea that the government needs to force its

3

employees to subsidize unions or otherwise the

4

unions will disrupt the government, and I

5

submit that's not an interest that this Court

6

can accept as a compelling one for infringing

7

on individuals' First Amendment rights.

8
9

I'd also like to make a brief point
about the grievance process.

And we've talked

10

a lot about collective bargaining today.

11

grievance processing is equally an expressive

12

activity and in the aggregate can have an

13

effect upon the public fisc.

14

But

Now, in terms of expressive activity,

15

a grievance is, by definition, the union is

16

trying to influence what the government is -­

17

wants to do and, if it's a grievance, it's

18

something that the government is resistant to

19

actually doing.

20
21

And advocacy to enforce a policy is
tied into advocacy to adopt that process.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're basically

23

arguing:

Do away with unions.

Because you're

24

really taking, in essence, and saying every

25

single employee decision is really a public

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

policy decision.

2

I have an individual person I want to

3

fire or discipline.

You just said it's a

4

public policy question.

5

MR. MESSENGER:

No, where I was going

6

with that, Your Honor, is that grievance as -­

7

as a whole is a public -- a matter of public

8

concern.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

don't deal with one issue.

11

a different issue.

12

for being late.

13

for a workplace disruption.

14
15
16
17
18

But grievances
Every grievance has

Some people are disciplined

Some people are disciplined

MR. MESSENGER:

Some for -­

Yes, Your Honor, but

nonmembers -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- violating a

dozen other workplace rules.
MR. MESSENGER:

But under the statute,

19

nonmembers are charged for contract

20

administration as a whole.

21

an entire year's worth of AFSCME's grievance

22

processing, some of which are very significant,

23

like a grievance AFSCME recently filed to

24

compel the state to expend $75 million to pay

25

for a 2 percent wage increase.

They're charged for

That went to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
71
1

the Illinois Supreme Court.

2

grievances are more minor matters, as you

3

mentioned, but as a whole, in the aggregate,

4

they affect matters of public concern.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. MESSENGER:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Maybe some other

As Justice -­

That is what -­
-- Breyer said,

8

every single decision affects the public fisc.

Every time you lose something, you -- the

10

public fisc is affected.

11

You're talking -­

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

Care to

comment?

14

MR. MESSENGER:

Again, to go back, I

15

think it's the scale that makes the

16

distinction, Your Honor.
