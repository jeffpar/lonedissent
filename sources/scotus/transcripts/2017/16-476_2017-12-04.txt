ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11
12

MR. OLSON:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

13

One of the most important decisions

14

made at the Constitutional Convention in 1787

15

was replacing the failed confederacy that

16

governed states with a national government that

17

could regulate individuals but not states.

18

In the words of this Court in the New

19

York case, Congress may regulate interstate

20

commerce directly, but it may not regulate

21

states' regulation of interstate commerce.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Olson, isn't

23

that what the government does whenever it

24

preempts state laws?

25

regulate.

It says you can't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

MR. OLSON:

When -- when the

2

government preempts state laws, the

3

government -- the federal government has

4

initially taken the position or taken an action

5

to regulate interstate commerce in some

6

respect, and when it does that, this Court has

7

repeatedly held, it may preempt contradictory

8

or inconsistent state laws.

Pardon?

MR. OLSON:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

or don't regulate at all.

MR. OLSON:

The -­
So -­

As a matter of fact, what

10

the consequence of that is that the -- the

11

states could regulate according to the

12

standards established by the federal government

13

with respect to the regulation of interstate

14

commerce, and if the states chose not to do

15

that, the field was left to the federal

government.

Well, the Airline

Deregulation Act is the obvious example.
MR. OLSON:

Yes, and the Airline

22

Deregulation Act is a very, very good example

because in that case, the Congress of the

24

United States took a wide responsibility with

We're not going to forbid it.

And we

I mean, you can -- you see the

20

MR. OLSON:

I do see the analogy.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. OLSON:

Okay.

So we -­

And the Morales case to

23

which you're referring has -- discusses in

24

great detail the federal regulatory scheme,

25

which included, as a portion of the federal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

regulatory scheme, a preemption of the states

2

from regulating fares, conditions of service,

3

and that sort of thing.

4

But -- but, Justice Breyer, that is an

5

area -- it's a quintessential example of the

6

federal government taking responsibility for

7

how airlines flew in this country and deciding

8

in certain areas, yes, it could be preempted.

9

This statute is completely different.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what does that

11

mean?

What would you be looking for, when you

12

say that the federal government took

13

responsibility?

14

federal government had just said we don't want

15

states to regulate.

16

ourselves; we just want -- I think this is what

17

Justice Breyer's question was -- a free market.

18

So is that enough responsibility that the

19

federal government has taken?

20

MR. OLSON:

I mean, suppose that the

We don't want to regulate

I believe it is not

21

because that is a situation where the -- where

22

the Congress would be saying we're choosing to

23

regulate states.

24

may not participate in regulating commerce that

25

is taking place in your state.

We're telling states that you

We don't want

Heritage Reporting Corporation

to take any responsibility.

2

burden and expense and accountability all on

3

the states to do so.

4
5
6

We want to put the

This is quintessentially what the -­
the Congress did here.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess what I'm

7

asking, Mr. Olson, is you're suggesting that

8

the federal government, in order to preempt

9

state activity, has to itself enact some kind

10

of comprehensive regulatory scheme; and the

11

question is, you know, how -- what would we be

12

looking for if that -- if that were our test?

13

When do we know that they've enacted a

14

sufficiently comprehensive regulatory scheme in

15

order to allow preemption of state rules?

16

MR. OLSON:

The only thing that I

17

would say in response as a predicate to

18

answering your question is that when you say

19

"sufficiently comprehensive," to the extent

20

that the state -- the federal government,

21

Congress, has taken responsibility to regulate

22

in that field, once it has done so, it can then

23

preempt, under the Supremacy Clause,

24

inconsistent or contradictory state laws.

25

the Supremacy Clause is where this preemption

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official
10
1

all comes from.

2

the -- the -- the Constitution, statutes, or

3

treaties shall be the supreme law of the land.

4

The Court has construed that repeatedly as

5

saying that -­

6

It requires -- it says that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and it

7

doesn't even have to be inconsistent if the

8

federal government occupies the whole field.

9

MR. OLSON:

Yes.

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

Pacific versus Arizona -­

12

MR. OLSON:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In -- like Southern

That -­
-- a state cannot

14

regulate the length of a -- of a freight train

15

simply because this is reserved for the

16

Congress.

17

So that's fairly standard.
Could you, in -- in this case, to

18

avoid commandeering concerns, interpret the law

19

as saying that if states do legislate, then

20

they will be preempted?

21

MR. OLSON:

Well, first -- no, not -­

22

I think, if I understand your question

23

correctly, Justice Kennedy, is if Congress had

24

taken responsibility to decide to do something

25

about sports wagering by regulating it in some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

respect or taking responsibility in some

2

respects and then it could say that, where a

3

state is doing something that's inconsistent,

4

then that can be preempted.

5

But the title of this statute says it

6

all, to -- the -- an act to prohibit sports

7

gambling under state law, so what Congress was

8

saying there -- and when Congress passed the

9

statute, it had a report from the Congressional

10

Budget Office that specifically said this will

11

have no budgetary impact on the federal

12

government -­

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can we interpret

14

that as saying that, if you do regulate, then

15

it will be preempted?

16

MR. OLSON:

If -- it -- it may be

17

preempted.

Congress, as you know, Congress may

18

adopt a statute that explicitly -- expressly

19

preempts or, in some cases, impliedly preempts

20

state laws that are inconsistent or in -- in a

21

way that -­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. OLSON:

24
25

Okay.

And then -­

-- obstructs the

accomplishment of a federal objective.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Now, I'm seeing this,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

I think.

Is this your argument?

2

just say yes if it isn't, please.

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

Dereg Act.

6

reason.

7

And don't

Forget the Airline

It was a bad example for this

Now, I think what you actually say is

8

the federal government makes a determination of

9

what interstate commerce will be like in

10

respect to this particular item.

It can do

11

that, we -- including a determination, it

12

shouldn't be -- that's a determination, okay?

13

Once it makes that determination, it

14

can forbid state laws inconsistent with that

15

determination.

16

what it can't do is say that our determination

17

is that the states roughly can do it as they

18

want, but they can't do it that way; for to do

19

that is to tell the state how to legislate, in

20

which case it is the state and not the person

21

who becomes the subject of a federal law.

22
23

That's called preemption.

MR. OLSON:

But

I wish I'd said that

myself, Justice Breyer.

the Court said it almost the same way in New

12

the Tenth Amendment limits the power of

13

Congress to regulate in the way it has chosen,

in that case, to -- instead of directly

regulating, Congress has impermissibly directed

the states to regulate.

MR. OLSON:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So if it -- if it

5

we already said that the federal government can

regulate that activity by the state?

7

MR. OLSON:

8

Yes.

In fact, it -­
So why is it that

telling the states that it can't license,

11

itself in gambling a strict prohibition of a

commercial actor?

13

MR. OLSON:

It's a -- it's -- the

14

question is interstate commerce, and, yes, just

15

as the language in the New York case, which I

16

just quoted, Congress may regulate that field.

17

If it does regulate that field, which

18

Congress has not chosen to do in this case, it

19

then can preempt inconsistent state laws.

Mr. Olson, you

-- you have not challenged 3702 subsection (2),

MR. OLSON:

370 -- subsection (2) is

simply a counterpart to subsection (1).

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you didn't

challenge it?

3

MR. OLSON:

We -- we challenged the

4

entire statute, but we were not sued under that

5

section.

6

subsection (1).

7

of the same coin because subsection (2) says

8

pursuant to law.

We were sued for violating section -­

9

Subsection (2) is another side

The law that's referred to in

10

subsection (1), we say, is something that the

11

states can do and the -- the Congress, if

12

Congress chose to prevent it, it would be

13

unconstitutional.

14

But that subsection -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but by

15

its -- by its terms, though, subsection (2)

16

operates on the individuals and not the state.

17

MR. OLSON:

Only -- only if

18

individuals operate pursuant to law, which

19

means pursuant to the state law, which is

20

referred to in subsection (1).

21

little confusing because the way Congress chose

22

to do it.

23

a belt-and-suspenders thing, and what it is -­

24

and I sort of accept that, because subsection

25

(2) simply seems -- seeks to do indirectly what

This is a

But the government refers to that as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

we contend subsection (1) can't do directly

2

under -- under the Constitution.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -­

One part of

4

subsection (1), it seems, is -- is not

5

challenged either, and that's the ban on the

6

state itself operating gambling casinos.

7

MR. OLSON:

This -- this would be

8

something similar, Justice Ginsburg, to the

9

Reno versus Condon case or the South Dakota -­

10

I mean, South Carolina versus Baker case, where

11

the federal government chose to enact a law of

12

general application to -- that applied to

13

private parties engaged in interstate commerce

14

on -- and applied the same law to the states

15

when the states were engaged as a market

16

participant in the same -- to the same degree

17

as interstate commerce -- in -- in interstate

18

commerce.

19

So, to the extent that Congress had

20

initially decided to regulate this area and put

21

itself into the field of regulating private

22

persons engaged in activity, it could then

23

address the states if the states choose to

24

engage in the same activity.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, if you took

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

this statute and you take the prohibition on

2

private parties and you can have a comparable

3

prohibition on the state, what do you

4

accomplish by knocking out the "authorized by,"

5

if you have two parts that are not

6

constitutionally infirm and they achieve almost

7

the same thing?

8
9

MR. OLSON:

It would be

constitutionally infirm, Your Honor, had -­

10

because the state -- because the Congress

11

didn't attempt to regulate interstate commerce

12

directly.

13

which it did not do so, quite obviously, it

14

could then regulate the state as a market

15

participant to the same degree it was

16

regulating private citizens as a market

17

participant.

18

And it could then, if it did so,

I could go -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

pretty comprehensive.

20

is a total -- total prohibition.

Well, this is

The comprehensive aspect

21

MR. OLSON:

Yes, it's -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so I don't

23

know whether it's -- you seem to be saying that

24

they can't regulate it if the regulation is

25

going to be a total ban.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

MR. OLSON:

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

No.
But that -­

that's -- it's -- that's very comprehensive.

4

MR. OLSON:

No.

I under -- I agree

5

with what -- the way you stated it, but that is

6

not PASPA.

7

betting, gambling on sports, then it could

8

address the state as a participant in that same

9

activity.

10

If PASPA said we prohibit sports

It did not do so.

This statute does

11

-- attempted to have the states -- and that's

12

why I quoted the name of the statute -- to

13

prohibit sports gambling, it didn't stop there.

14

It said sports gambling under state law.

15

And what it intended to do -- this is

16

what you talked about in the New York case, New

17

York versus United States, is it put the

18

accountability, the expense, the

19

responsibility, the burdens on the states and

20

basically said, as the -- as the Congressional

21

Budget Office says, it won't have any effect on

22

the federal budget because the federal

23

government is doing nothing.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Olson -­

It also said in the Senate

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20

report it won't have any regulatory impact.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So suppose I read

3

these cases as setting up a principle that the

4

federal government can't conscript state

5

officials for its own purposes, you know, the

6

federal government can -- does whatever it

7

wants, consistent with the Commerce Clause, but

8

it can't conscript state officials in order to

9

do -- help them -- help the federal government

10
11

do it.
If that's the way I see these cases,

12

what's being -- who is being conscripted in

13

order to do what here?

14

MR. OLSON:

What is -- it's both

15

conscription and the Court uses the word

16

commandeering and directing the states.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

MR. OLSON:

Yeah, so -­

All of those terms, all of

19

of preemption.

response to the Third Circuit's decision and

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have three ways

of looking at this case or of the issues here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

The first way is to say that this is a repeal,

2

which it seems you're arguing, and you're

3

saying to us does or does not this statute

4

permit a repeal?

5

And if I say it permits repeals of all

6

kinds, partial or complete -- partial or not

7

partial, we avoid the constitutional question

8

because then you could do whatever kind of

9

repeal you want.

10

The second way to look at this is that

11

the statute does not prevent repeals at all.

12

That's what you're arguing right now.

13

would make this statute unconstitutional.

14

That

And the third approach is basically

15

what the government is arguing here, which is

16

it prevents -- it permits complete repeals but

17

not partial repeals because partial repeals of

18

the nature taken here are actually

19

authorizations that are prohibited by the law.

20

So those are the three approaches.

22

approaches are?

one way, and I submit the only way, of looking

avoid that has been suggested here is that

there may be some appeals -- and the Third

much authorization," which is very much like

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4
5

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

6

PASPA does three basic things:

7

First, it tells the states that they

8

may not themselves operate or advertise sports

9

gambling schemes, such as a sports-based

10
11

lottery or a sports book.
Second, it tells private parties, in

12

3702(2), that they may not operate or advertise

13

a sports gambling scheme pursuant to state law.

14

And, thirdly, it tells states that

15

they may not authorize or license third parties

16

to conduct those sports gambling schemes that

17

would violate federal law.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Mr. Clement -­

But it does so by

20

this mechanism.

It leaves in place a state law

21

that the state does not want, so the citizens

22

of the State of New Jersey are bound to obey a

23

law that the state doesn't want but that the

24

federal government compels the state to have.

25

That seems commandeering.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

MR. CLEMENT:

No, Justice Kennedy, we

2

don't think PASPA operates in that way.

3

think that, if New Jersey wants to say we're

4

going to lift all our prohibitions, we think,

5

at least as to that law, it would not be

6

preempted by PASPA as written.

7

We

I think it's a separate question,

8

especially in New Jersey, whether the private

9

conduct that would take place pursuant to that

10

repeal, especially at casinos and racetracks,

11

would be prohibited by 3702(2).

12
13

partial repeal is forbidden, correct?

21

-- what partial repeals are not forbidden?

22

What could the state do?

Well, first of all, I

24

think it's important to recognize that what

25

PASPA regulates -- and it does regulate it

Official
33

quite comprehensively -- is the operation of

sports gambling schemes.

3

regulate sports gambling in the generic sense,

4

and it says nothing about individuals engaging

5

in sports gambling.

6

It doesn't actually

So, if New Jersey wants to say, look,

7

all our prohibitions which right now are both

8

on the supply side and the demand side, all of

9

its prohibitions on the demand side, it can

10

partially repeal.

11

It could -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could a state

12

enact a law -- I mean, the federal government

13

enact a law saying no state shall pass an

14

income tax greater than 6 percent?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I think it might be

16

able to do that because I -- I -- put it this

17

way, I mean, I don't know why in principle that

18

would be so different from the statute at issue

19

in Baker, which says no state shall issue a

20

bearer bond.

21
22
23

And -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No state shall

issue?
MR. CLEMENT:

A bearer bond.

So I

24

think it's the same.

But I think, to the

25

extent there would be anything odd about it,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

and it's what Mr. Olson suggests is odd about

2

PASPA, is this idea that there's just a

3

preemption provision.

4

And even he seems to concede that, if

5

Congress regulated the field, that there would

6

be no problem with the preemption provisions -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it seems

8

to me that there would be something a little

9

more odd about it, which is it goes to the

10

fundamental powers and prerogatives of a state

11

to sort of function their own -- own

12

government, if you say you can go so far as to

13

regulate what level of income tax they can

14

charge.

15

should amend my remarks to say I don't think

there would be a commandeering problem with

7

be free enterprise in fares?

8

the things you mentioned have the word "state

9

law" in it.

10

No, because all

So all we have here are a group, if

11

you like, of provisions, all of which are

12

addressing themselves to what kind of law a

13

state may have, without a clear federal policy

14

that distinguishes between what they want

15

states to do and what the federal government is

16

doing.

17

Given those circumstances, it falls on

18

the subject matter of this law is the state.

19

That's what this is about, telling states what

20

to do, and therefore, it falls within

21

commandeering.

22

A little long, but that's how I was

23

reading New York, the notion of not addressing

24

itself to the states.

25

you can answer the whole thing.

And it's long so that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I'll try to answer

2

the whole thing, but I'll start with the

3

proposition that we know there's absolutely

4

nothing wrong with congressional legislation

5

that operates on states as market actors.

6

And that's what the first four

7

prohibitions in 3702(1) plainly do.

8

-- tell the states, you can't operate,

9

advertise, sponsor, or promote sports gambling

10

schemes.

11

private parties that you can't do those four

12

things pursuant to state law.

13

mind, those private parties can't do it as a

14

matter of federal law in violation of state law

15

because it's a federal criminal prohibition.

16

So that's okay.

They tell

It also tells

And keep in

So all that leaves, then, is the

17

provisions that they've challenged, the license

18

or authorize.

19

context of this statute, is an express

20

preemption provision; which, of course it's

21

addressed to the states and local governments,

22

because states and local governments are the

23

ones that can pass laws that might be

24

preempted.

25

And all those are, in the

problem.

2

analogous to Baker.

3

the states they couldn't have bearer bonds.

4

They also told private parties, you can't have

5

bearer bonds.

6

Think about it -- I think it's very
In Baker, Congress told

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But -- but you -­

7

you begin by saying that this is market

8

participant as to the first three, but it's not

9

as to the fourth.

10

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it's -- I -- I

11

don't mean to be pedantic.

12

participant as to the first four, not to the -­

13

not to the fifth and the sixth, which are

14

licensed and authorized.

15

It's market

But -- but my point is you're already

16

telling the states that they can't do

17

something, just like Congress did in Baker.

18

You can't issue bearer bonds.

19

3702(2), especially right against the

20

backdrop of statutes like 18 U.S.C. 1955, tells

21

private parties, you can't issue bearer bonds,

22

you can't operate sports gambling schemes.

23

So the only thing in the middle is a

24

provision that says, states, you can't

25

authorize or license private parties to engage

Heritage Reporting Corporation

43
1

in conduct that violates federal law.

2

provision weren't in the statute, I think the

3

same laws would be impliedly preempted under

4

those that apply in implied preemption.

5

Congress says expressly, those laws -- states,

don't do that, don't authorize and don't

license private parties to engage in conduct

that would violate federal law.

preemption.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If that

And if

That's classic

Well, you seem

11

-- you said subsection (2) is the other side of

12

the coin of subsection (1).

13

that if that's the case, that subsection (2)

14

cannot be severable from subsection (1).

15

MR. CLEMENT:

And it seems to me

Well, I don't know if I

16

used the phrase "other side of the coin," Your

17

Honor, but I do think that it is not just

18

severable; I think it operates independently,

19

and it operates without even a constitutional

20

issue.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

To do the same

22

thing, right?

Because it says that it is

23

illegal for individuals to follow state law -­

24

MR. CLEMENT:

Well -­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- or to engage

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

in activity protected, authorized under state

2

law; which seems to me to be the same thing as

3

saying states shall not authorize individuals

4

to do that.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Your Honor, a

6

couple of points.

One is I do think there's

7

some difference in text between 3702(2) and

8

3702(1); and I think there's an argument that

9

the parties haven't had to brief here because

10

this really hasn't been a 3702 case.

11

think there's a good argument that 3702(2) is

12

actually broader, and "pursuant to law" is

13

broader than "licensed or authorized by law."

14

But I

So just put that to one side, though.

15

What I would say is, particularly when you read

16

3702(2) against the backdrop of the preexisting

17

federal statutes in Title 18 that made

18

operating a sports gambling scheme, in

19

violation of state law, a federal criminal

20

prohibition, then it's a comprehensive scheme.

21

It basically says, private parties, there's

22

something that is an -- a -- essentially a

23

cancer on interstate commerce that we don't

24

want to take place.

25

And that is -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, Mr. Clement,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

how do we know that Congress would have passed

2

(2) without (1)?

3

(1) makes the regulation free because

4

it says, states, you have to do this.

5

doesn't cause any budget impact on the federal

6

government.

7

And it

(2), under your interpretation, is a

8

direct regulation by the government, and

9

therefore might cost money.

And you could see

10

a legislature saying:

Well, you know, (1)

11

makes sense, and I'm only going to vote for (2)

12

because of (1) -­

MR. CLEMENT:

free.

So -­
-- because it's

It comes for free.

16

MR. CLEMENT:

So -- so, Justice

Gorsuch, I'd like to make two points in

18

response to that.

19

the CBO scored it as being zero and so it's

20

free.

21

provisions and other federal criminal

22

provisions, and CBO tends to score them the

23

same way.

24
25

One is, on this idea that

We actually looked at other preemption

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That's neither here

MR. CLEMENT:

Okay.

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But then -­

-- for purposes of

3

my -- my question.

4

asking the severability question the Chief

5

Justice posed to you, one of the questions we

6

have is what Congress would have done in -- in

7

a different world?

8

question to answer, but that's the question

9

we were posed.

10

My question is, if we're

Now, that's a very hard

And how do we know Congress would have

11

passed (2) without (1), given that (2) in this

12

world, if it's -- if (1) is fine, (2) comes for

13

free?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

So, Justice Gorsuch, if

15

I could, I'd like to refine the question -- the

16

-- in this way -- and you tell me if it's

17

unfair -- but I think really the critical

18

question is:

19

have the first four prohibitions in (1) and the

20

prohibitions in (2), if it couldn't have the

21

"licensed or authorized by law" provision?

22

Would Congress have wanted to

I think that's the relevant question,

23

because their constitutional argument only goes

24

to "licensed or authorized by law."

25

think, although all these counterfactual

And I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

questions are difficult, I think this may be

2

the easiest one that you'll ever have, because

3

I think the statute operates almost the same

4

way.

5

The net effect of a statute that said

6

that states can't sponsor, operate, advertise,

7

promote sports gambling schemes and neither can

8

private parties pursuant to state law; and, by

9

the way, they can't do it in violation of state

10

law because of other provisions -- that world,

11

what it would mean is we should have gone for

12

the injunction against the private parties.

13

Which, by the way, we did in the

14

district court.

15

still there in front of the district court.

16

When we first filed our TRO, we went against

17

the state and we went against the private

18

parties.

19

there was an unclean hands argument that arose

20

only with the private parties, so the district

21

court enjoined only the -- the states.

22

And that issue, I think, is

We got a TRO against both, and then

But the net effect of these two

23

statutes without "authorized or licensed," is

24

the same as a statute that sort of left that to

25

implied preemption.

It's essentially the same

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

statute.

2

So, I think in a counterfactual world,

3

would Congress want a statute that still told

4

the states that you can't operate or advertise

5

sports gambling schemes and told private

6

parties that you can't operate sports gambling

7

schemes pursuant to state law and, oh, by the

8

way, you can't do it in violation of state law

9

anyway because that violates a whole bunch of

10

criminal prohibitions, obviously they'd want

11

that.

provision, it's -- it's like neat -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

One -- one -­

-- tidy law-making, but

it's not vital.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Give me a

one-sentence answer.
In the Airline Deregulation Act, the

20

Congress wanted a world, i.e., the United

21

States, where market forces set prices.

22

the acts you're talking about put together,

23

Congress wanted the United States -- fill in

24

the blank.

25

MR. CLEMENT:

In all

The -- the Congress

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

wanted there to be, putting aside the

2

grandfather clause, no state-sponsored or

3

-operated gambling taking place by either

4

individuals or by the state.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

Now, you had

6

to use the word "state-sponsored" to date that,

7

and as soon as you had to describe it, you had

8

to use the word "state-sponsored" there.

9

"State-sponsored" means legislation, and

10

therefore, there is no interstate policy other

11

than the interstate policy of telling the

12

states what to do.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Can I amend my answer?

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes.

Congress -- Congress, in

17

all of these statutes, did not want there to be

18

sports gambling schemes operating in interstate

19

commerce.

20
21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Congress could

--

22

MR. CLEMENT:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

They were indifferent -­
Congress could have

24

prohibited sports gambling itself.

So what

25

federal policy is served by this statute that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

would not have been served by the former?

2
3
4

MR. CLEMENT:

Two things, Justice

Alito.
First is:

Congress could have

5

prohibited all sports gambling; but that would

6

have required it to regulate individuals as

7

sports gamblers as opposed to entities,

8

businesses that were providing sports gambling

9

schemes -­

10
11
12

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

So I amend

the question:
Congress could have prohibited

13

gambling enterprises itself.

14

could have done that, assuming it's within the

15

Commerce Clause.

16

serve that that would not?

17

No question it

What policy does this statute

MR. CLEMENT:

Ironically enough,

18

Justice Alito, it actually furthers federalism

19

values by saying:

20

one-size-fits-all policy, which says as a

21

matter of federal law, everybody who operates a

22

sports gambling scheme is going to face two

23

years in the federal penitentiary and a fine of

24

$10,000; this statute basically says, look, 46

25

states right now are more or less doing what we

instead of having a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

want, but they're doing it in 46 different

2

ways.

In some cases, it's -­

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Or -- or does it

4

serve the interest of making it cheap by

5

allowing Congress not to have to expend any

6

funds to enforce its laws?

7

MR. CLEMENT:

With all due respect, I

8

don't think trying to do this on the cheap was

9

their principal concern.

10

As I said, as a general matter, when

11

Congress passes a new federal statute, criminal

12

statute, it's -- doesn't really have like, a

13

big budgetary impact; because you don't, like,

14

have to make like a new AUSA to enforce that

15

statute.

16

and the enforcement priorities that Justice

17

Sotomayor alluded to work on the federal level

18

as well.

19

You just let everybody enforce it,

And if you preempt state law, that

20

tends to not have a budgetary impact either.

21

But what's distinct about this is it basically

22

says, look, 46 states, if you want to regulate

23

this in 46 different ways, have at it.

24

want to repeal those laws, I mean, you can do

25

it.

If you

I mean, that repeal itself won't violate

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

3702(1).

2

pursuant to it might violate 3702(2).

3

The sports gambling that takes place

I actually think that rather than have

4

a one-size-fits-all federal felony where

5

everybody's going to get the same exact

6

sentence, having a system where, you know, one

7

state makes it a misdemeanor, another state

8

makes it a felony, another state goes at it

9

with all their enforcement regulations -­

10

policies because they think it's really

11

important -­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement, what -­

13

what's the line you would draw as between

14

preemption and commandeering?

15

MR. CLEMENT:

I would draw the line

16

that this Court drew in New York and Printz,

17

because it was writing its opinions against the

18

backdrop of all sorts of preemption statutes

19

that various parties were saying were relevant

20

and the Court was distinguishing.

21

I would say that, unless the Congress

22

basically tells the states that they must

23

regulate -- that they may, basically, pass

24

federally-prescribed legislation, or enforce a

25

federally -- a federal policy as in Printz -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So what's the

2

difference between saying you must pass a

3

certain piece of legislation and saying you

4

must maintain a piece of legislation on the

5

books?

6

MR. CLEMENT:

I -- I don't think that

7

there is a distinction necessarily between

8

those two, but I don't think that's what PASPA

9

does.

PASPA doesn't say thou must maintain

10

your existing prohibitions on the books.

11

you think about it -­

12
13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How is it different

from that?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

It -- it's different

15

about that because it basically tells the

16

states, look, you want to repeal that

17

prohibition, you can do that.

18

repealing the law will not violate PASPA.

19

Okay?

20

If

Your act of

I mean, you know, and think about it

21

in analogy to Baker.

22

preexisting prohibition on issuing bearer bonds

23

in Baker and it repealed that pre-existing

24

prohibition, nothing would happen.

25

If a state had a

If, on the other hand, the state

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

itself started issuing bearer bonds because

2

there's no longer a prohibition or private

3

parties started issuing bearer bonds because

4

there was no longer a prohibition, that action

5

by the state or by the private party would

6

violate the federal statute.

7

PASPA works.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's the way

Could Congress just go

through federal -- the -- the statutes of the

10

states and pick out a long list of statutes

11

that can't be repealed except in full?

12
13

MR. CLEMENT:

May I answer the

question?

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Certainly.

No, I don't think it

16

could do that, Justice Alito.

17

think what Congress did here is it said:

18

we already say as a matter of federal law in a

19

variety of provisions that people who engage in

20

gambling businesses in violation of state law

21

violate federal law.

22

But, again, I
Look,

And we now have this prospect that

23

maybe some states are going to authorize this,

24

and we're going to complete our federal policy

25

by saying, look, if you're a private party and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

you're operating a sports gambling scheme, we

2

don't care if you do it in violation of federal

3

law, that's criminal, or pursuant to state law,

4

that's civilly prohibited by PASPA.

I don't think that's a constitutional
problem.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL ON

11

BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS

12

CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

13
14
15

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
I think Mr. Olson has boiled down the

16

state's case to what I take to be his two basic

17

arguments.

18

says, because New Jersey is forced to keep a

19

law on its books and there's no accompanying

20

comprehensive federal regime.

21

arguments are incorrect.

22

This is a commandeering problem, he

Both of those

As to the first, I'd encourage the

23

Court to look at page 383 of the JA.

The

24

injunction in this case does not remotely

25

require the state to keep a law on its books.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

It says the state cannot give

2

operation or effect to its preempted law.

3

is exactly, almost word-for-word, what Justice

4

Scalia said in Printz, the Supremacy Clause

5

requires.

6

preempted by federal law, the state can be

7

required -- and state officials can be

8

required -- not to give effect to that

9

preempted law.

10
11

That

If the state passes a law that is

That is not conscription in any

meaning of the -- of the word.
And as to the second, I think this

12

comprehensive federal regime is -- is a made-up

13

principle for the reasons Mr. Clement gives.

14

federal statute often says states may not

15

regulate interstate commerce in a particular

16

way because the federal policy is just that the

17

states are to take their hands off of that

18

particular part of interstate commerce.

19

But even if the Court thinks it's a

20

principle, it doesn't need to reach it here

21

because there is actually a federal regime

22

beyond PASPA itself.

23

A

Federal law criminalizes the operation

24

of a gambling scheme that's in violation of

25

state law; so when states in the early '90s

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

started looking at authorizing these things,

2

Congress handled the other half of the circle

3

and said, all right, look, we're not going to

4

make it criminal, but we will give an

5

injunctive action to the attorney general and

6

the Leagues so that if states start authorizing

7

sports gambling schemes -- which we know states

8

can't do and we know individuals can't do, and

9

they've never argued there's any constitutional

10

problem with those two legs of the stool -­

11

then if states start doing that, we'll give a

12

civil injunctive action, and that's far less

13

invasive of state sovereignty.

14

And I think -- look, that this -- I

15

mean, as Mr. Clement says, it's Baker all over

16

again.

17

individuals can't do it.

The states can't do it, and the

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. WALL:

20
21

Mr. Wall -­

They've never argued

there's any -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you go back to

22

the basic question, and it was raised, I think,

23

by the dissent, Judge Fuentes, who said you

24

start this discussion from the fact that a law

25

exists, if it's a partial or full repeal, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

law doesn't exist.

2

that's the baseline.

3

Period, end of story.

And

So why is a partial repeal

4

unconstitutional -- or in violation of the

5

preemption clause?

6

exist, the fact that they've carved out a

7

certain section of the -- of the population for

8

whom the law will stay in existence, that's not

9

actually authorizing.

10
11

Because if the law didn't

That's just merely

repealing.
MR. WALL:

So I think that would be

12

right for a lot of the things that the state

13

would do; but when the state says, we're going

14

to repeal our law in such a way that nobody in

15

the state can run a sports lottery or sports

16

book, except for the 12 state licensed casinos

17

and racetracks that already conduct authorized

18

gambling operations -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but that's

20

the issue that the court below avoided.

21

haven't looked at the licensing laws below -­

22

in -- in New Jersey because they weren't

23

provided to us, and it was further afield than

24

the question presented, but the court below

25

said that it was not -- passing on that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official
59
1

question because it found a different answer.

2

But you might be right if the licenses

3

that those two facilities hold really are -­

4

are general and say, you're authorized to do

5

any gambling permitted by law.

6

have an argument.

7

repeal, what does it matter?

8

MR. WALL:

9
10

Then you might

But if all they do is

So I think it's even

simpler than that, Justice Sotomayor, and it
gets to something Justice Gorsuch said earlier.

11

They want to interpret the statute as

12

barring all repeals so that they can create a

13

constitutional problem with two words of the

14

statute or law and leverage that to try to take

15

down the entire thing.

16

And our point's pretty simple.

If the

17

Court sticks to what it says in Gunther and

18

says an authorization is affirmative enabling

19

20

channels to particular state license providers,

21

but it's not going to be most things that New

22

Jersey does.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The Third Circuit

2

said de minimis private gambling isn't covered.

3

On page 30 of your brief, you indicate maybe

4

the state could have a certain dollar

5

threshold, and that wouldn't be authorizing.

6

I -- I'm really not clear why that

7

wouldn't be authorizing if you specify a

8

threshold dollar amount in state law.

9

know, what -- what if they said you can do it

You

10

at the Elks Club, is that authorizing?

11

-- where does the government draw the line?

12

MR. WALL:

Where

I think the only thing the

13

Court needs to say here, Justice Gorsuch, is:

14

in the context of PASPA, if you -- or whatever

15

-- however the state get -- gets there,

16

legislating up, legislating down, amendment,

17

repeal, enact, it doesn't matter -- if what

18

it's doing is channeling sports gambling to

19

particular preferred -- state-preferred

20

providers, that's an authorization.

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But we have no

22

record about that, as Justice Sotomayor points

23

out.

24

authorizing means any repeal of any degree of

25

any kind.

And the Respondent took the position that

Why shouldn't the Respondent have to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

live with that invited error, perhaps, now in

2

this case?

3

MR. WALL:

Justice Gorsuch, I don't

think it's a record question.
I think it's, look, in the 2012 law,

6

they affirmatively said, we're going to let

7

only the casinos and racetracks do it.

8

was a problem.

9

violated PASPA.

10

That

They didn't dispute that it

Then they came back and said, well,

11

we'll repeal our prohibition, but just for the

12

same casinos and racetracks.

13

point is -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And our only

I'm sorry, but the

15

earlier version actually explicitly licensed -­

16

it explicitly licensed and set up a complete

17

operation requirements and other things.

18

That -- I don't think they would have

19

had a snowball's chance to say that that wasn't

20

licensing or -- or effectively operating.

21

But here, what they're saying is there

22

were no laws -- there's a law prohibiting all

23

gambling, we're now going to repeal part of it

24

and say some gambling is okay.

25

MR. WALL:

So -­

Justice Sotomayor, unless

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

what the Court wants to say is no repeal can be

2

an authorization, even if New Jersey took away

3

its prohibition only at the Borgata -- which

4

would provide a roadmap, I think, for flouting

5

the Supremacy Clause; because then you could

6

just enact a prohibition and peel it back

7

wherever you wanted.

8

Unless the Court is prepared to say

9

that a repeal can never be an authorization,

10

which I think would elevate form over

11

substance, this particular repeal is -- and -­

12

and I think all the Court needs to say is, for

13

PASPA purposes, if you're channeling to

14

particular entities, here, 12 state-licensed

15

casinos and racetracks, that's an

16

authorization.

17

And read in that way, there's no

18

constitutional problem; because it requires

19

affirmative conduct by the state to enable -­

20

it's no longer a conscription, we're not

21

telling them they have to maintain anything,

22

the state, it can sit there and do nothing, and

23

it's perfectly compliant.

24
25

The one thing -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But what if

the repeal -- what if the repeal is across the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

board, no exceptions?

2

MR. WALL:

If New Jersey just repeals

3

its prohibitions, we have said we don't have a

4

problem with that.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, is that

6

serious?

You have no problem if there's no

7

prohibition at all and anybody can engage in

8

any kind of gambling they want, a 12-year-old

9

can come into the casino and -­

it, Mr. Chief Justice.

and sanctioned sports gambling schemes.

The problem that

Well, but when

21

you put the state in a position that that's the

22

only thing they can do, that's not a real

choice.

MR. WALL:
they can do.

Oh, it's not the only thing

They can strengthen, or they can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

repeal in whole, or they can repeal in part in

2

various ways.

3

The one thing they can't do is

affirmatively engage in the one kind of conduct

5

that Congress took off the table as a policy

6

matter, and that's the definition of

7

preemption.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- but the

13

government -- Mr. Wall, the last time around,

14

the government did say, in recommending that we

deny cert, that PASPA does not require New

16

Jersey to retain prohibitions it adopted

17

pre-PASPA.

18

prohibitions in whole or in part.

19

the government represented to this Court.

20
21
22

It is free to repeal those
That's what

Was that -- was that statement
inaccurate?
MR. WALL:

No.

I think we did not

23

take into account the gamesmanship in which New

24

Jersey was going to engage.

25

We said the same thing we're saying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

here today, that they've got a lot of options

2

on the table.

3

the one thing that Congress preempted.

4

The one thing they can't do is

And so we said they can engage in lots

5

of partial repeals, but we didn't have in mind

6

that New Jersey would come back and do the 2012

7

law, but style it as a partial repeal.

8
9

And, yes, I wish we had dropped a
footnote and said, if New Jersey tries to

10

accomplish the same thing, but just styles it

11

as something different, that will equally be an

12

authorization for PASPA purposes.

13

And just to return to your question,

14

Mr. Chief Justice, I will completely grant that

15

Congress assumed that states were not going to

16

start authorizing this if they couldn't profit

17

from it.

18

long time.

19

And that assumption was true for a

And if states start lifting their

20

prohibitions in whole, I think Congress may

21

well want to revisit that.

22

have anything to say about it.

23

what New Jersey is doing is giving an unnatural

24

interpretation of federal statute to create a

25

small problem with two words and then try to

But PASPA doesn't
And what the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
66
1

leverage that small sickness to take down the

2

entire patient.

3

And that's just not the way statutory

4

interpretation and severability normally work,

5

but they have to do that because it's the only

6

way that can get them where they want to go,

7

which is to take down the private party

8

prohibition in 3702(2), which they've never

9

argued is even -- even potentially

10

accommodating language.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're saying this is

12

authorization, not a repeal, because it's

13

limited to the casinos, which probably have all

14

kinds of other rules and regulations, 9:00 a.m.

15

opening and dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

16

those circumstances, it amounts to an

17

authorization, not a simple repeal, is that the

18

argument?

19

MR. WALL:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. WALL:

And under

Exactly.
Okay.

If you're trying to figure

22

out what constitutes an authorization to

23

operate a sports gambling scheme, any law that

24

says everybody can't do it, except for you two

25

or three, that's an authorization.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

And it doesn't matter whether the

2

state gets there by legislating up or down,

3

because it's substance over form.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

And then

5

-- they're then -- once you say that, I think

6

their argument is:

7

federal policy which says states can't -- well,

8

there is no federal policy against authorizing

9

sports gambling but for a federal policy that

10

says a state can't authorize sports gambling,

11

and that is to commandeer.

but, you see, there is no

12

Have I got that right?

13

MR. WALL:

I think that is their

14

argument, but I think it doesn't make sense for

15

the simple reason Mr. Clement gave.

16

Baker would not have been different

17

if, in addition to having a prohibition on

18

states and individuals, it had said states are

19

preempted if they try to authorize private

20

conduct that's separately barred by the Act.

21

If this Court finds that to be a

22

latent commandeering violation, the government

23

would respectfully submit it's going to spend

24

an awfully long time figuring out how to unblur

25

the clear line between preemption and

commandeering.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Olson, I do

have a question following up on what the Chief

asked earlier.

21

Jersey legislature is doing exactly what he

22

thinks they shouldn't do or wouldn't do, which

23

is that they are considering legislation that

would fully repeal the sports betting

prohibitions.

The Respondent says the New

MR. OLSON:

Where does that consideration

Congress could not possibly have intended in a

bill to prohibit this expansion of sports

betting, to have it construed in a way that

18

would remove -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. OLSON:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why?

-- all limitations.
Let -- let me ask

22

you, what's so crazy about Congress perceiving

23

that states would never want 12-year-olds to go

24

into gambling houses and that the states would

25

find some way of prohibiting that or living

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
70
1

with rules of some sort of creating laws,

2

regulations, conduct that would prohibit that

3

sort of thing?

4

MR. OLSON:

What Congress can do is

5

enact a statute that places restrictions on

6

sports betting and -- and have a

7

finely-reticulated statute.

8

-- the provision that it permitted Nevada to

9

have, which is careful regulation of something

It can adopt the

that's taking place.

11

What we have now is activity that is

12

billions of dollars that is taking place

throughout the United States.

unlawful.

16

selective -- your selective prosecution theory,

17

that they're permitting fantasy teams?

18

19

20

about betting on sports games, and that -­

21
22

No, no, no, I'm not

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

States.

The rest of it is illegal.

12

why don't we legalize -- this is a

13

hypothetical -- marijuana because all of -- and

14

all drugs, because there's a rampant market out

15

there for those drugs, but we've made a policy

16

choice that we don't want the state involved in

17

promoting that type of enterprise.

18

MR. OLSON:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

And the federal -­
Why is this any

different?
MR. OLSON:

The Congress of the United

22

States enacted laws with respect to marijuana

23

and with respect to other substances.

24

that's -- that's in play right now because

25

various states have done various different

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
72
1

things.

2

But we have no question here that what

3

Congress intended to do was pass a law -- would

4

look at the statute, as I said before, the -­

5

the statute says it's an act to prohibit sports

6

gambling under state law, not under federal

7

law.

8
9

The preemption process starts with the
idea that there must be a federal

10

constitutional provision in a statute or in a

11

treaty or in the Constitution, and then the

12

federal government may take steps to prevent

13

states from interfering with the accomplishment

14

of that.

15

My opponent, Mr. Clement, talked about

16

the -- the -- the South Carolina versus Baker

17

case.

18

said the exact same thing that New York versus

19

United States says, and the Printz case says:

20

Section 310, regulated states activities is -­

21

does not seek to control or influence the

22

manner in which states regulate private

23

parties.

24
25

South Carolina versus Baker specifically

And the same thing is true in the -­
in the Reno case.

My opponent talked about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
73
1

statutes of general application.

2

sentence of that case, this Court specifically

3

reserved the question whether Congress could

4

single out states with respect to activities

5

and didn't decide whether it could do so in the

6

-- outside the context of a statute or general

7

application.

8
9

In the last

When the -- when this suit was first
filed by the Leagues, their complaint

10

specifically said PASPA imposes a broad ban on

11

sports betting, subject only to the narrow

12

exceptions that apply here.

13
14
15
16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You have an

extra couple minutes, Mr. Olson.
MR. OLSON:

Thank -- thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice.
This is -- as the federal government

18

said on page 15 of the federal government's

19

brief -- we are saying that state laws that

20

attempt to change what New Jersey has done are

21

nullified by PASPA.

22

Anyone familiar, as this Court is,

23

with the history of the Constitutional

24

Convention knows that there was specifically on

25

the agenda an opportunity for Congress to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
74
1

nullify state laws.

2

That was defeated.

The whole debate with respect to

3

federalism had to do with whether Congress was

4

going to be permitted to regulate interstate

5

com -- regulate states, or would it be required

6

to regulate commerce first, and as an adjunct

7

to that, constrain what states could do.

8
9

And that's exactly what this statute
did.

The federal government, the Congress

10

wanted a prohibition under state law because it

11

would have no responsibility, no

12

accountability, and -- and our opponent's brief

13

says, if you're complaining about

14

accountability, call your Senator.

15

That's exactly what the United States

16

talked about, what the Court -- this Court

17

talked about in New York versus United States.

18

The accountability is very important.

19

The structure is important to the liberty of

20

citizens.

21

ordained structure.
