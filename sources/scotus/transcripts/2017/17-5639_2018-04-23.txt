5

Chavez-Meza versus United States.

Mr. Coberly.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TODD A. COBERLY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. COBERLY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Judicial discretion is not a whim.

12

is to be guided by sound legal principles and

13

subject to meaningful appellate review.

14

It

And if appellate review for abuse of

15

discretion is to mean anything, it is axiomatic

16

that there must be a reason for the district

17

court's decision apparent in the record.

18

is particularly true where Congress has

19

channeled the exercise of a district court's

20

discretion by directing the district court to

21

consider certain factors when making a

22

discretionary choice.

23

This

As the Court understood in Taylor, a

24

district court in such circumstances must

25

clearly articulate not only that it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

considered -- in fact, considered the relevant

2

factors but how those factors impacted its

3

decision.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I suppose

5

you're not arguing that that's true in every

6

case.

7

proceedings indicated exactly what the people

8

were talking about, they were debating a

9

particular point and that would explain it,

10
11

For example, if the record or the

that would be enough, right?
MR. COBERLY:

Mr. Chief Justice, we do

12

believe that it would be enough.

13

oftentimes, as the Court recognized in Rita,

14

how much explanation a district court judge

15

needs to give depends so much on circumstances

16

and context.

17

There's -­

And I -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What is the

18

standard of review that the court of appeals

19

uses for sentence -- for sentences?

20

MR. COBERLY:

Justice Ginsburg, it -­

21

it's -- it's reasonableness, which this Court

22

understands in the original sentencing context

23

to mean -­

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that what

-- doesn't the statute say, 3742, "imposed in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

violation of law"?

2

MR. COBERLY:

It -­

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question is

4

whether the sentence is imposed in violation of

5

law?

6

MR. COBERLY:

Yes, Your Honor.

And as

7

the Court has understood in -- in -- from

8

Booker, through Rita, through Gall, ultimately,

9

what that means, is was the -- was the sentence

10

reasonable?

11

procedural reasonableness and substantive

12

reasonableness.

13

And there's two components:

The

And, ultimately, this Court has

14

understood that what -- what reasonableness

15

means is, did the district court abuse its

16

discretion?

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how could that

18

be if the -- the district court sentenced

19

within -- within the guidelines?

20

same range, and it wasn't the same point within

21

the guidelines as the original sentence, but it

22

was still within the guidelines.

23

a within-the-guidelines sentence be imposed in

24

violation of law?

25

MR. COBERLY:

It wasn't the

So how could

Well, I think that's the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

government's position, which is, well, in a

2

sentence reduction, when it's reduced and it

3

falls within the guidelines, the government's

4

position, as I understand it, is essentially

5

that that decision is unreviewable.

6

disagree with that -- that proposition.

7

And we

No matter what, as the Court has made

8

clear in Gall, within-guideline sentences,

9

outside-guideline sentences, the district court

10

has -- has an obligation to explain the reason

11

for the sentence.

12

in the -- in the sentence reduction context of

13

3582(c)(2).

14

And that holds, we believe,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How much of an

15

explanation would -- would be required?

16

say -- and take this very case.

17

-- what explanation would have sufficed?

18

MR. COBERLY:

Let's

What -- what

Your Honor, we believe

19

what would have sufficed -- I don't want to

20

prejudge the case and tell the district court

21

-- I don't want to presume what the district

22

court was thinking, because that's the whole

23

point, is we simply don't know.

24
25

And so what we're asking is -- is for
the Court to apply the rule it has already

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

applied in Rita and Gall.

2

simply sufficient explanation to allow for

3

meaningful appellate review -­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And that's -- it's

Suppose a case, not

5

this case, suppose a case where the judge

6

sentenced to the middle of the guideline -- or

7

the old guideline range; then the new guideline

8

range comes out and he does the middle of that.

9

Explanation required?

10

MR. COBERLY:

In a -- in a typical

11

case, Your Honor, I think in that situation,

12

that would be what we're calling a proportional

13

reduction.

14

be -- it could be inferred from the record why

15

the judge did what he did.

16

All things considered, that would

However, I think there are certain

17

circumstances in that particular situation

18

where the judge might need to provide more

19

explanation, and that would be where either

20

party, either the -- the defendant or the

21

government, had made non-frivolous arguments as

22

to why there needed to be something different.

23

But in the -- in the typical, in the

24

run-of-the-mill, in a -- in a mine-run case, I

25

do believe that that would be sufficient.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And there are tens

of thousands of these hearings a year?

3

MR. COBERLY:

Well -­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Of course, it

5

depends on when the guidelines are changed,

6

but -­

7

MR. COBERLY:

Exactly, Your Honor.

8

And -- and I believe the Sentencing Commission

9

estimated that there -- that this particular

10
11

amendment, 782, affected over 46,000 prisoners.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Does that -- should

12

that be a factor in our decision; i.e., the

13

obvious workload on the federal courts?

14
15
16
17
18

MR. COBERLY:

Well, Your Honor, I

think it -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Or is that something

we don't consider?
MR. COBERLY:

Well, I think it's

19

certainly something you -- you can consider and

20

I would ask the Court to consider this.

21

not asking for anything really that the

22

district court is not already -- should be

23

doing, and that is considering the -­

24

considering the sentence reduction in light of

25

the 3553(a) factors, and Section 1B1.10 of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We're

Official
9
1

guidelines, and then coming to a reasoned

2

decision as -- as to why it's -- it's imposing

3

a particular reduced sentence.

4

All we're asking for is simply the

5

district court to jot down a few words in most

6

instances as to how that reasoning is.

7

don't -­

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So we

I don't quite

understand in practical terms -- excuse me -­

10

what that would mean.

11

goes through each of the 3553(a) factors and

12

says, well, you know, as to (A), it's a serious

13

offense and it's serious enough to warrant a

14

sentence of 114 months, and we need to have

15

adequate deterrence, and I think 114 months is

16

the amount that you need for adequate

17

deterrence and so forth?

18

MR. COBERLY:

So what if the court

Would that be enough?

It so -- it so much

19

depends on context, Justice Alito.

And in that

20

particular case, I don't think it would be

21

enough without -- without more information in

22

the record that that -- that that explanation

23

by the district court would be tied to a

24

particular fact within the record.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Let me just tell

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

you, given the workload numbers you've just

2

cited and your answer to Justice Alito, I'm

3

becoming less convinced of your case.

4

MR. COBERLY:

Justice Kennedy, we -­

5

our concern is that a simple check -- let's -­

6

let's say, for instance, the AO-247 form, which

7

we -- which we think is perfectly fine, had a

8

-- had a -- had a checklist of the 353(a)

9

factors and all that was required was a judge

10

to check a box that he considered -- he or she

11

considered those factors.

12

would be enough.

13
14
15

We don't think that

There needs to be just something
minimal in the record.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, I just

16

don't understand what "minimal" means.

17

you're answering Justice Alito the way you did,

18

which is I can't imagine needing anything more

19

than a judge saying I'm going to grant a

20

reduction, but given the seriousness of this

21

crime and how -- what you did, I think whatever

22

number he picks, why that would become

23

unreasonable or subject to more explanation.

24
25

MR. COBERLY:

If

And that's why I think,

I mean, just a few words can matter, Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1
2
3

Sotomayor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you said to

Justice Alito no.

4

MR. COBERLY:

Well -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm asking -- that

6

-- that's shocking to me, to be frank with you,

7

because that answer would mean that the judge

8

not only has to say that the crime was serious,

9

what you did was serious, but I think 108 is

10

not enough because it's the bottom of the

11

guideline range; I don't think the guideline

12

range should control.

13

I mean, what more of an explanation

14

does a judge have to do than to say it was a

15

serious crime, 114 is the right amount?

16

MR. COBERLY:

I think just some

17

indication that the judge actually had

18

considered that particular crime.

19

simply -- all I'm saying is simply just saying

20

-- I don't want to say that -- I don't want to

21

create a rule that a district court judge in

22

any instance -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so

I'm afraid that -­

24

you keep answering -- you're creating a rule

25

that makes it impossible for district court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

judges to do anything but what you want.

2
3

MR. COBERLY:

And I certainly -- I

certainly don't want that, Justice Sotomayor.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but that's

5

where it's coming.

6

here.

7

original sentence said, I'm troubled by this

8

crime and the degree of your participation in

9

it.

10
11

Let's -- let's start at

We know the district court at the

It's a serious crime.

You were a very

active participant in it.
He still gave him essentially the low

12

end of the guideline.

13

unreasonable for us to infer that in the

14

resentencing he picked 114 because he remained

15

concerned about the seriousness of this crime

16

and your defendant's participation in it?

17

MR. COBERLY:

But why is it

Your Honor, if -- if the

18

district court judge in this particular case

19

had said something to that effect of:

20

looked at this case again, and considering the

21

seriousness of the drug trafficking, and tied

22

it specifically -- just said a word that -­

23

that made it clear that that was tied

24

specifically to that case, and I remain

25

convinced that 114 months is reasonable, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I've

Official
13
1

think, in that situation, that would be plenty.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Since the

3

guidelines are advisory, what would make it

4

improper for the judge to say, I don't care

5

what the guidelines say, I think trafficking of

6

this type is serious, and I think that 114

7

months is the right amount for -- for the

8

seriousness of the crime and the deterrence.

9

How could you appeal that?

10

MR. COBERLY:

I don't -- we would have

11

a tough time appealing that, Your Honor.

12

think that's well within the right of the

13

district court.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I

I guess my -- I -­

15

I have a great deal of understanding that

16

having the judge say something makes sentencing

17

appear to the public as being less than

18

arbitrary.

19

that -- that -- that the justice system should

20

consider.

21

And there is a value in explanation

The question is how much and why

22

checking off a box is not enough, because I

23

take the judge at his or her word that when

24

they check off the box, they've done what

25

3553(a), I think it is, requires.

But is there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

a difference between checking off a box and not

2

checking off a box?

3

MR. COBERLY:

I think there is a

4

difference, Your Honor.

5

fact of an articulation that -- one can be

6

convinced, one understands that the district

7

court judge actually thought about this case

8

and considered it, and simply checking a box I

9

don't think does enough.

10

We -- we say it is -­

it is -­

11
12

And it -- it's the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Go ahead,

please.

13

MR. COBERLY:

It is not -- we're not

14

asking for much.

And contrary to what the

15

government has claimed that we're asking for,

16

which is detailed or extensive explanations, we

17

are -- I want to assure the Court we are not.

18

We're simply asking for just a -- a bare

19

minimal enough to -- to convince an appellate

20

court that there was a reasoned basis for the

21

decision.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

MR. COBERLY:

So if -­

And, Justice Sotomayor,

24

like you -- like you just said, the need to

25

assure the public that our -- our judiciary is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

acting on -- on -- with sound legal principles

2

in applying the law and not making arbitrary

3

decisions.

It doesn't have to be much.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

just says same -- same reasons as before?

6

MR. COBERLY:

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if he

Mr. Chief -­
Before he's

8

done a fairly, you know, the usual, what's

9

required under 3553, and those are the same -­

10

what he's saying, those are the same things

11

that is -- that are motivating him in this new

12

context, same reasons as before?

13

MR. COBERLY:

Well, I think, in this

14

particular case, Mr. Chief Justice, if -- if

15

the judge had said that, that would pose a

16

problem because, in -- in this particular case,

17

tied back to the original sentence, it was

18

clear that the district court judge had -- had

19

tied his sentence and adopted the reasoning of

20

the Sentencing Commission.

21

And he sentenced at the bottom of the

22

guidelines.

He referred to the reason the

23

guidelines sentence in this case is high is

24

because of the type of drug and the quantity of

25

drug.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

And if he simply adopted that same

2

reasoning, then one would expect that the -­

3

his -- his -- his understanding of how -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So you'd be

5

fine?

6

would give you the grounds you want to present

7

on appeal, just as you've articulated here.

8

that ought to be fine as far as you're

9

concerned?

10

I mean, that gives you -- you say that

MR. COBERLY:

So

I -- I think -- right.

11

And we have to -- I have to remember -- we have

12

to remember that we're talking here just about

13

the -- a procedural component, and that is

14

simply an explanation to get us to understand

15

the judge's reasoning.

16

there's some indication of the judge's

17

reasoning, we would then have something to

18

grasp onto on appeal, and maybe we would argue

19

that on appeal.

20

So, if there's -- if

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

One aspect of this

21

case, it strikes me as curious.

So this is an

22

appeal from the resentencing; couldn't -- could

23

this defendant, instead of going to the court

24

of appeals, said:

25

please reconsider or clarify why the first time

District Judge, would you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

around you put me in the bottom of the range

2

and the second time in the middle?

3

-- could have moved for clarification before

4

the district court.

5

MR. COBERLY:

You could

Justice Ginsburg, we -­

6

there -- there's no -- there's no specific rule

7

in the Rules of Criminal Procedure that allows

8

for that.

9

was -- it was appealable.

10

And so this was a final order and it

Now, in practice, would -- could one

11

in theory make such a request?

12

given that there's nothing required in the

13

rule, there's no -- there's no requirement that

14

the district court has to actually reconsider

15

that, other than just saying motion to

16

reconsider denied, and in the context of this

17

case, Mr. Chavez-Meza had filed his motion for

18

a sentence reduction under 3582(c)(2) over a

19

year before the -- the district court judge

20

made his decision.

21

I suppose.

But

And under the existing law, as -- as

22

it was understood in the Tenth Circuit, we

23

thought it was best to just take an appeal and

24

have it remanded back, which is all we're

25

asking for in this instance, is to have the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

case remanded back to the district court for

2

consideration of the reduction in light of the

3

3553(a) factors and to provide some explanation

4

for its -- its ultimate decision.

5

Your Honor, our concern -- Your

6

Honors, our concern ultimately is that the

7

government's construction of the statute would

8

allow just this particular case of -- of a

9

class of defendants and class of cases not -­

10

not subject to appellate review at all.

11

there's no principal basis looking at the

12

statute for such a rule.

13

And

And as the Court understood in Dillon,

14

the purpose of Section 3582(c)(2) was to give

15

prisoners the benefit of the Sentencing

16

Commission's determination that there was a

17

systemic problem with a particular guideline.

18

And precluding appellate review

19

entirely of this type of case would undermine

20

congressional intent.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why would this

22

preclude appellate review?

Isn't it pretty

23

obvious what -- or couldn't the court of

24

appeals infer that what the district court did

25

was this:

The district court originally

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

thought 135 months was the right sentence -­

2

that was the original sentence, right, 135?

3

MR. COBERLY:

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

district court thought:

6

was lowered, and so I'm going to go down to

7

114, but taking into account the sentencing

8

factors, I don't think it should go below 114.

9

And I think that's the -- I don't know that you

10
11

Yes, Justice Alito.
All right.

And so the

Well, the -- the range

need to spell all that out.
And if -- if that's what the court

12

said, would that be sufficient?

13

would be sufficient, why can't there be

14

appellate review, just as -- based on what was

15

done here?

16

MR. COBERLY:

And, if that

I don't think in that

17

particular case, Justice Alito, that would

18

necessarily be sufficient because it just says

19

in my opinion.

20

decision does not tie that opinion somehow to

21

the 3553(a) factors.

22

It does not -- the -- the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, why doesn't it

23

tie it to the 3553(a) factors?

There's nothing

24

-- there isn't an algorithm that tells you how

25

to put those factors together or to quantify

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

each one.

2

the various factors, the seriousness of the

3

offense, deterrence and so forth, and says this

4

is the right number.

5

It's the judge takes into account

MR. COBERLY:

And all we're asking

6

for, Justice Alito, is just a little bit

7

he's got to do is have a couple of words.

MR. COBERLY:

position we're in, because there was nothing in

something.

We couldn't -- we were precluded

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but it

11

depends on the -- the range of the departure.

12

In other words, if whatever you think is what

13

it should look like or the norm, you mention in

14

your brief an argument about where you thought

15

it should be proportionately, and if it's out

of whack, and nothing is said, it seems to me

you have a stronger case than what you've

would be helpful, Justice Kagan, but I'm not

sure that that actually -- those words either

would actually get to our point, which is that

there needs to be something that the public can

You -- you seem to

be having some kind of a presumption that the

recognizing that when -- when there is

proportionality and the record is silent, we

think that in the mine-run of cases one can -­

one can rest assured that the district court

judge here simply applied the exact same

reasoning that it applied at the original

sentencing context to the -- the amended

We're simply

So, for instance, you know, if someone

was sentenced at the top end of the guidelines,

there was no new information that was presented

24

by either party in the sentence reduction

motion, and the district court judge in a

the top of the amended guidelines range, we

think that that would be sufficiently clear in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if it was

and a lot of the appeal of your objection is

the boilerplate language.

had actually, you know, written it out?

the actual language, he says I've taken into

account the policy statement, I've taken into

account those factors, to the extent they're

14

applicable, this is what I think.

15

I think if you had seen that in an

order written out, you know, that based on what

17

you've said, that would seem to be sufficient.

I -- it -- it seems to me your objection is -­

in other words, you don't -- you don't really

believe it when it's just a check in a box.

You think, well, he really hasn't done that;

he's just checking the box.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROD J. ROSENSTEIN

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
There are three reasons why this Court

should uphold the district court's

discretionary decision to grant a sentencing

24

reduction and to impose a new sentence in the

bottom quartile of the applicable sentencing

principle.

Congress chose not to deviate from the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And this Court

What if they

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, can -­

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- a judge is

24

-- has had, you know, 600 of these

25

resentencings, every time just checks the box,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

600, he's done nothing but check the box, and

2

the results are a little off; sometimes it's

3

high, sometimes it's low; you can't really tell

4

why?

5

Do you have the same position?

6

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Your Honor, we -- we

7

believe that the premise there that the

8

district court is merely checking a box is a

9

mistake.

The form reflects what the district

10

court is required to do by statute.

11

there's no reason to presume here that the

12

court is checking a box and not actually doing

13

what's required.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And so

Even if it's

15

-- even if he's done it 600 times, never done

16

anything but check the box, you still presume

17

that he's giving the careful consideration in

18

each of those cases?

19

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, in no case,

20

Your Honor, is the court merely checking a box.

21

The court is checking a box indicating whether

22

it's granting or denying the motion, but then

23

it's actually required to compute the guideline

24

range and then select a new sentence.

25

And so it's not merely a matter of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

checking a box.

2

conscious decision about what sentence to

3

impose within that new guideline range.

4

The court is actually making a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, do you

5

have a different position with respect to a

6

denial of a motion for a reduction?

7

8

reduction, would you hold the same position?

9

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

If a judge

Your Honor, there

10

have been different variations of this form.

11

The form that's used in this case, we believe,

12

would clearly suffice because the form -­

15

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The judge denied

17

-- basically denies -- after looking at

18

everything, I deny this motion for reduction.

19

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

With or without -­
Does that permit

intelligent appellate review?
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Your Honor, if the

23

court had completed the form and checked the

24

box indicating it had denied the motion, the

25

court would have certified by signing that form

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

that the court had gone through the appropriate

2

considerations, that is, they considered the

3

3553(a) factors and considered the policy

4

statement.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how about if a

6

judge in the original sentence gives the low

7

end of the guideline but in the -- in the

8

revised reduction gives above the original

9

guideline but below the sentence he gave now?

10

Would that require more of an explanation than

11

signing this form?

12

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

No, Your Honor, we

13

don't believe it would, because that would be a

14

lawful sentence within the guideline range

15

specified by the Commission and would reflect,

16

as this Court said in Rita, the presumption -­

17

pardon me -- that in a typical case the court

18

has determined -- essentially has adopted the

19

reasoning of the Commission and has done what

20

the judge is supposed to do.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The one thing I

22

hate about absolute rules in this area, dislike

23

intensely, is that why shouldn't we trust the

24

court of appeals to determine how much

25

information it needs or doesn't need to give

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1
2

meaningful appellate review?
Some courts have said if you refuse to

3

depart completely, you should explain why.

4

Others have said but if you don't and you pick

5

a sentence within the guidelines, we will infer

6

that you've said enough if you signed the form.

7

Others have said you should always give a

8

little bit more.

9

Another character -- category of court

10

of appeals have done what the Tenth Circuit has

11

done, but I think there's only two that have

12

done what the Tenth Circuit has said.

13

Why isn't it always up to the court of

14

appeals to determine how much it needs to

15

determine whether adequate review can be given?

16

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, the

17

-- this Court in Gall indicated that with

18

regard at least to departures, courts of

19

appeals may, but are not required, to impose a

20

presumption of -- of reasonableness.

135 months.

23

But if you look to that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, do -- do you

24

think that in that original sentence it was

25

because it was -- the sentence was at a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

particular place in the guidelines, i.e., the

2

low end?

3

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

No, Your Honor, I

4

don't believe so.

5

course, we're in a post-Booker context here.

6

The district court is guided in part by the

7

guidelines but is required to consider all the

8

relevant 3553(a) factors, and at the original

9

sentencing, that's precisely what the court

10
11

Remember, keep in mind, of

said.
The court said he had taken into

12

account the history and characteristics of the

13

defendant and the need to impose a sentence

14

sufficient but not greater than necessary to

15

achieve the purposes of sentencing.

16

That is a somewhat conclusory -­

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

18

But that's -- that's

true in every case.

19

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Sure.
But why this number?

21

Why wasn't -- why wasn't this -- if -- if he'd

22

have done at the low end of the new revised

23

guideline range, that would have been okay,

24

wouldn't it?

25

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

2

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Without any

explanation?

3

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Correct.
Well, then why isn't

5

an explanation required here when he does

6

something different?

7

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Because of the

8

background rule, Your Honor.

Again, this -­

9

the sentencing guidelines were adopted in 1984

10

against a backdrop of long-standing precedent

11

of this Court, reflected most significantly in

12

the Dorszynski case, where the Court indicated

13

that in the absence of any statutory mandate,

14

at common law, the court -- district courts had

15

discretion to impose sentences anywhere up to

16

the statutory maximum.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can you explain -­
I guess I'm finding it

19

a little bit hard, Mr. Rosenstein, to

20

understand your understanding of the background

21

rule, because my understanding of the

22

background rule comes from Taylor, where it

23

said:

24

that a decision will be governed by

25

consideration of particular factors, a district

"Where, as here, Congress has declared

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

court must carefully consider those factors as

2

applied to the particular case, and whatever

3

its decision, and clearly articulate their

4

effect in order to permit meaningful appellate

5

review."

6

So we're in one of these "where, as

7

here" situations where Congress has declared

8

that a decision is going to be governed by

9

consideration of particular factors.

And -­

10

and Taylor seems to say:

11

for intelligent appellate review is for the

12

district court to clearly articulate why he did

13

what he did.

14

Look, what we need

Now it doesn't have to be lengthy.

15

can just be pointing to, you know, this was a

16

serious crime, here's -- here's why, the end.

17

But -- but there has to be something, says

18

Taylor.

19

It

No?
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Your Honor, we

20

respectfully submit that Taylor does not apply

21

in the context of sentencing.

22

overrule Dorszynski.

23

Honor, we submit that Rita well might have come

24

out differently, because this Court ruled in

25

Rita in 2007 that no explicit analysis is

It didn't

And if it had, Your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

required of the 3553(a) factors.

2

There are -- if you break them out,

3

there are 15 distinct factors in 3553(a).

4

if there's a resentencing, there are also three

5

additional factors established by the policy

6

statement, 1B1.10.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

You did at the

8

beginning -- I mean, there is something I don't

9

understand about this.

I -- I tend to agree

10

with you that if we suddenly start saying you

11

have -- I mean, I've seen hundreds, if not

12

thousands, of -- of district court decisions

13

which take the following form:

14

summary judgment denied, okay, or motion for

15

this or that denied.

16

Motion for

And if we're suddenly going to say,

17

well, this has to have more than that word

18

"denied," I don't know what's going to happen.

19

So I tended to follow what Justice Sotomayor

20

said.

21

we need to know more and sometimes they

22

wouldn't.

Sometimes the court of appeals would say

23

But I think what he's arguing, and I

24

may be missing something, is that the statute

25

says in 3553(c)(1) that if the sentence is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
40
1

within the guideline range and it exceeds 24

2

months, the court at the time of sentencing

3

shall state in open court the reason for

4

imposing sentence at a particular point within

5

the range.

6
7

Now it doesn't say that when you're
reconsidering.

8

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Correct.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

But it does say it at

10

the beginning.

And so the background rule

11

isn't that you don't have to give a reason.

12

The background rule is just what I read.

13

So how does it work?

14

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Yes.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I want to know how it

16

works and, after all, if that's the rule, if

17

I'm right that that is the rule, how do they do

18

it, and shouldn't you have whatever they have

19

to do there the same here?

20

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

No, Your Honor.

21

Respectfully, the -- the background rule that I

22

refer to is the rule in the absence of any

23

statutory -­

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:
statute.

Well, here is a

I'm saying -- my question is, how

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
41
1

does that work in the ordinary sentencing case

2

where we've all said, gee, sometimes you just

3

can't say more.

4

more.

5

Well, the statute seems to say

And then, if it -- whatever that is,

6

why shouldn't it be the same here?

7

what they're saying is you don't have to say

8

it's the same if it's proportional because it's

9

obvious.

10
11
12

And I think

But if it isn't proportional, it

isn't obvious.
And so you should have to say
something.

Okay.

So what is the -­

13

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Yes -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- response?

15
16

What is

the response?
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

-- Justice Breyer.

17

And the answer to that, Justice Breyer, is that

18

with regard to sentences that are governed by

19

3553(c) -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

21

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

-- there are actually

22

three levels of explanatory requirements.

23

first is the requirement to state reasons in

24

open court, which is 3553(c).

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

Right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official
42
1
2

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

The second is for a

sentence with a range above 24 months -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's right.

4

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

-- you provide a

5

reason for a particular point in the range, as

6

you articulated.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

8

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

And the third is for

9

a sentence outside the guideline.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, yeah, right.

11

I'm only interested in the particular point

12

within the range.

13

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Correct.

But, Your

14

Honor, this provision, 3553, was adopted as

15

part of the Sentencing Reform Act in 1984

16

contemporaneously with Section 3582(c).

17

3582(c), the Congress decided not to

18

incorporate the 3553 requirements.

19

And in

And that is why we respectfully submit

20

the 3553(c) requirements do not apply under

21

3582.

22

we recognize and the district court

23

acknowledged, but it does not incorporate the

24

procedural requirements.

25

It expressly incorporates 3553(a), which

Now this Court affirmed that in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Dillon case, where -­

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, but I guess

3

that's peculiar.

5

you know, the guideline is 108 to 122 months.

What's the reason for that?

And you have to give your

But if you do precisely the same thing
on resentencing, you don't.

10

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

But why?

And the reason -- the

11

answer, Your Honor, as articulated by this

12

Court in Dillon, is that we are not at a formal

13

resentencing proceeding here.

14

motion for a reduction, which is -- this Court

15

recognized in Dillon is not governed by the

16

constitutional or remedial holding of Booker.

17

It's an act of congressional lenity,

We are at a

18

of legislative grace, and Congress in enacting

19

that provision was entitled, we submit, to

20

permit the court to do it in an expeditious

21

way.

22

And -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So assume there

23

wasn't a form and that the judge's real reason

24

was that he thinks blacks who commit this kind

25

of crime should be punished severely.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

44

How are we supposed to know or check,

I'm not assuming that any

Yes.

-- some

impermissible motive is -- is at play.

9

he or she is doing or some basic reference to

11

If we

why, how do we know?
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

And, Your Honor, I

12

would give two answers to that.

The first is

13

that no matter what the judge says, you never

14

know what the judge is thinking and doesn't

15

articulate.

16

But the second is that, under Walton

17

v. Arizona, a long-standing principle, courts

18

presume that district courts know the law and

19

apply it faithfully.

20

contrary, we would face this issue really in

21

every case.

22

reasons; you know only the stated reasons.

23

in this case -­

24
25

If it were to the

You never know the unstated

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

But if you know no

reason, which is what Justice Kennedy started

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

with, we don't really know why he picked 114.

2

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, we submit, Your

3

Honor, that you do know enough, just as in any

4

ordinary original sentencing under Rita, you

5

know that the court was familiar with the facts

6

and circumstances of the crime, you know that

7

the court evaluated the 3553(a) factors and the

8

policy statements.

9

district court made at the original sentencing,

You have the comments the

10

which indicated that the court was aware the

11

defendant had other uncharged conduct.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -- so let's do

13

a different hypothetical.

14

gave the 114 because he got convicted of a

15

prison in -- infraction that was at the highest

16

level.

17

case -- the prison infraction was at the lowest

18

level and didn't even result in anything except

19

a warning.

20

The judge says:

I

And, in fact -- not the facts of this

How would the appellate court know

21

that the judge made a factual assumption that

22

was erroneous in picking that 114?

23

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

In your hypothetical,

24

Justice Sotomayor, the court has articulated

25

that reason?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

3
4
5

Yes.

Yes.

Well, in that

case, you -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what -- how do

we know if they don't articulate -­

6

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Right.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- their reason

8

for doing something, that they're not -- that

9

it's not based on an erroneous factual basis?

10

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

So, once again, we

11

can't deal with what the court doesn't say, but

12

if the court did express -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, but we should.

14

I mean, when we're making a rule that says you

15

never have to, as the Tenth Circuit has

16

indicated, then we don't know if an

17

impermissible factual or legal basis motivated

18

the judge.

19
20
21

And with factual, it's not
intentional; it's just wrong.
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

If there were any

22

evidence in the record, Justice Sotomayor, to

23

indicate that such an error had been made, the

24

defendant would be permitted on appeal to argue

25

procedural unreasonableness, just as this Court

contemplated in Gall.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If your

position prevails, why would any district judge

7

ever say anything about why he -- his position

8

on resentencing?

9

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

We -- we don't

10

presume, Your Honor, the district courts are

11

motivated solely by the desire to be -- to

12

avoid appellate review.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well -­

I believe a district

15

court, as -- as was contemplated in the Rita

16

opinion, it depends on the circumstances.

17

The district court can make its

18

judgment whether or not it believes that the

19

facts are such that it merits a more detailed

20

opinion, but if it's a routine, typical,

21

run-of-the-mill case, as this one was, and the

22

court looked to the original sentencing, where

23

it had said very little, we believe it's

24

appropriate under these circumstances for the

25

court to impose the appropriate sentence and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

simply say it had considered the factors.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, a judge

3

who -- under what circumstances was a judge -­

4

would a judge who did just that be subject to

5

reversal?

6

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

It would depend upon

7

the record, Your Honor.

As in all cases, the

8

appellate court would look to the entire

9

record.

Given the presumption of regularity,

10

which we submit is accorded in all cases, the

11

defendant who appeals this would have to

12

identify some error in the record, something

13

that would merit appellate review.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, like -­

15

like what?

I'm -- I'm saying the judge doesn't

16

say anything, and you say the presumption is

17

that he adequately considered all of the

18

factors and all that.

19

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Correct.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What type of

21

evidence in the record would suggest that that

22

wasn't the case?

23

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, if you're

24

talking only about procedural reasonableness,

25

as we're talking about here, you look to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

whether the guidelines were properly

2

considered.

3

there were other defendants in the case who

4

received disparate sentences.

5

find something in the record that indicated

6

that there had been some impropriety in the

7

sentencing proceeding.

8

You would look to whether or not

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You'd have to

So, as -- as I

understand it in this case, let's say there -­

there are any number of choices, but let's say

there are three choices:

kept the original sentence.

13

the low end of the guidelines.

greater than the earlier sentence.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No reasons required?

20

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, the reasons are

21

required.

The court is required to apply the

22

3553(a) factors and the policy statement, but

23

in the absence of any indication the court had

24

failed to do that, we submit that that would

25

suffice, even in an original sentencing under

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Rita.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And your -- your

18

understanding where -- the language that I read

19

you in Taylor where it said that there is some

20

necessity to state some amount of reasoning,

21

what do you think that that applies to?

22

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Your Honor -- Your

23

Honor, we believe that the Taylor case is not

24

generalizable.

25

the amount of explanation required under the

And as this Court said in Rita,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

guidelines depends upon the circumstances.

2
3

If it were otherwise, then we submit
--

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, is Taylor just

5

about the statute?

In Taylor, is that all it's

6

about?

7

suggest a broader rule.

8

where, as here, Congress has directed a

9

district court to consider particular factors,

Because, certainly, Taylor seemed to
It said, you know,

10

in order to have effective appellate review, we

11

need some brief statement about why the court

12

has come out the way it has based on those

13

factors.

14

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

So we believe, Your

15

Honor -- and there are two answers to that.

16

The first is that if you look to the concluding

17

paragraph in the Taylor opinion, the Court

18

indicated that the trial court in that case

19

relied on factors that were unsupported by the

20

record.

21

indicated that there was an error that was made

22

by the district court in Taylor.

23

So the record itself actually

But with regard to the issue of what

24

factors need to be considered, that is

25

ultimately an issue, we submit, of legislative

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

intent.

2

And in this case, in Section 3582,

3

Congress decided to permit an expedited process

4

and not to require all the procedures that

5

Congress created for original sentencing.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There's a -- there's

7

another statutory section, which is 3583(e),

8

which directs courts to consider the 3553(a)

9

factors, those -- these same factors that are

10

involved in this case, when terminating periods

11

of supervised release.

12

Do you think a judge can terminate a

13

period of -- of supervised release and send

14

somebody back to prison without any statement

15

of reasons?

16

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Your Honor,

17

hypothetically, the court would be permitted to

18

do that only if the record were sufficient -­

19
20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry.

Hypothetically what?

21

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Well, in some cases,

22

Your Honor, the record might be clear as to

23

what the basis was, but certainly there would

24

have to be a basis for the court to make that

25

decision.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, a basis.

But

2

the question is, do you think that the court

3

has to state reasons to send somebody back to

4

prison under 3583(e)?

5

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Your Honor, I don't

6

have the language in front of me.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It doesn't say

8

anything about explanation.

9

the relevant things.

10

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I apologize.

So I'll give you

Right.
It basically says you

12

have to consider the 3553(a) factors.

13

it does not say that you have to explain

14

anything.

15
16

But then

So the question is whether there's a
background rule that says -­

17

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
-- of course, before

19

you send somebody back to prison like that, you

20

have to at least say something.

21

question.

22

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Yes.

That's the

And -- and,

23

again, Your Honor, we believe it would be a

24

question of legislative intent, and we believe

25

that with regard to 3582, it's clear that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

Congress contemplated an expedited procedure

2

that would not incorporate the reasons required

3

in 3553 and would simply be subject to the

4

background rule.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7
8
9

Can you tell us -­
So can we do this -­

can we do -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
something about the form?

-- a little
What -- what was the

10

genesis of that, this Administrative Office

11

Form, what, AO-247?

12

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14
15

Correct, Your Honor.
How did that come

to -- to be?
MR. ROSENSTEIN:

My understanding,

16

Your Honor, is that form was developed by the

17

Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, along

18

with input from the Sentencing Commission, in

19

order to expedite these proceedings and ensure

20

that appropriate information was reflected in

21

the record.

22

Interestingly, Your Honor, the

23

original version of the form, I believe from

24

2008, did not include the language clarifying

25

that the court had considered the 3553(a)

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

factors and the policy statement.

2

In fact -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

4

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

-- one of the lower

5

It -­

court opinions -- pardon me?

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

I just want to go

7

back for a second to Taylor.

8

is that Taylor is speaking generally in 1988,

9

and it's considering the Speedy Trial Act.

10

My understanding

Subsequent to that, I believe we

11

decided a case called Rita.

12

Rita, we addressed specifically this question

13

at an original sentencing.

14

yes, there has to be some explanation, but the

15

length, the detail -- when it's within the

16

guideline, not outside the guideline, and I

17

think that was the intent of the Commission.

18

And I thought in

And what we said,

Outside the guideline, you better

19

explain it.

Inside the guideline, in this

20

range, it says, that the statute or precedent

21

does not insist upon a full opinion in every

22

case.

23

enough to satisfy the appellate court that he

24

has considered the arguments and has a reasoned

25

basis, but the length, the detail, the content,

The sentencing judge should set forth

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

even when to write is basically up to the

2

judge.

3

Then, when the judge does that, if the

4

appellate court needs more, it can ask for

5

more.

6

I haven't looked at it in a long time -- so I

7

thought that's what Rita was saying.

Now I thought that was what Rita -- but

8
9

And -- but there's nothing -- is there
anything wrong with that?

10

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

No, Your Honor.

And

11

I believe that's consistent with Taylor in this

12

respect, and that is that the principle -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I hope it was

14

consistent.

15

the later case and does deal specifically with

16

sentencing guidelines, as opposed to dealing

17

with the Speedy Trial Act.

18

But if it wasn't consistent, it is

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And

19

I think the -- the -- the point of commonality

20

is that the principle of Rita is that if the

21

district court is acting within the normal

22

range, the typical case, less explanation is

23

required.

24
25

When the court is doing something
unusual, outside the norm, more of an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

explanation is required.

Taylor, of course, is

2

a binary choice.

3

with or without prejudice.

The case is dismissed either

4

Here, we're talking about a range

5

where the courts have established that any

6

selection within that range could be a

7

reasonable sentence -­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, that's true, but

9

this case involves what the Petitioner calls a

10

disproportionality; that at the first instance

11

you got the low end of the range and at the

12

second instance, you're no longer at the low

13

end of the range.

14

And so the question that Rita raises

15

is, in a case like that, is something a little

16

bit more required, so that the judge says, you

17

know what, I don't want to be at the low end of

18

the range in -- in -- given this new range,

19

because of the seriousness of the offense.

20

the judge doesn't have to do that at length, as

21

Rita said, maybe the judge doesn't even have to

22

do it in writing, as long as the judge says

23

something to give both the defendant and the

24

appellate court some understanding of why the

25

judge is doing what the judge is doing.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
58
1

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

And

2

we respectfully submit that there is no magic

3

to this concept of proportionality.

4

not something that the defendant has rooted in

5

any statutory requirement or even in any

6

judicial finding.

7

This is

This idea that it needs to be

8

proportional is simply something that they are

9

trying to sell to the Court but we submit

10

really shouldn't be involved.

11
12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it raises a

question, don't you think?

13

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

No, I do not, Your

14

Honor.

15

the principle here is that the guidelines are

16

only one relevant factor.

17

The reason I do not is because the -­

If we were in a Booker world, perhaps

18

it would have more significance, but in a

19

post-Booker world, it's clear that that

20

district court in choosing 135 months was not

21

merely saying I will always pick the lowest

22

possible sentence -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Quite right.

And

24

that's why the -- the court can say I don't

25

think -- I don't want to go with the lowest

point in the new range, and -- and that's

2

absolutely the prerogative of the -- the

district court.

But the question that the Petitioner

5

raises is just whether the judge has to say,

6

I've thought about this question and I don't

7

want to be at the low end of the range anymore

8

because of the seriousness of the defense -- of

9

the offense or because of something else.

10

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Correct, Your Honor.
It just seems a -­

12

it's a minor requirement but one that seems as

13

though it would help the appellate court quite

14

a lot to know why the judge had chosen a

15

sentence that was no longer at the low end of

16

the range.

17

MR. ROSENSTEIN:

But I believe, Your

18

Honor, that if you were to look at Rita, that

19

the challenge that they are posing here really

20

would undermine the premise of Rita, which is

21

that for a typical sentence where the court

22

chooses a point within the range, there is no

23

requirement for detailed elaboration of the

24

reasons.

25

And why would more be required in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

3582, which this case has -- this Court has

2

indicated in Dillon actually is an abbreviated

3

proceeding, not subject to Booker.

4

the Court require more under 3582 than it would

5

under 3553 at an original sentencing?

6

Why would

So we respectfully submit that that's

7

essentially what the defendant is asking the

8

Court here to do, is to expand the explanatory

9

requirement not only to the Rita standard but

10
11

even beyond it.
And I think if the Court were to look

12

to the original sentencing in this case, as I

13

indicated, I believe that would not satisfy the

14

defendant.

15

In fact, they -- they have indicated

16

in their reply brief that even the one sentence

17

the government proposed, the clarifying

18

sentence we proposed in our brief at page 40,

19

the defendant in their reply brief at page 19

20

indicates that would not be sufficient for him.

21

So we really don't know what type of

22

detail would be satisfactory, but we

23

respectfully submit that if you were to take

24

their argument to the logical extreme, it would

25

require in every case for the court to address

Heritage Reporting Corporation

every conceivable factor, of which, as I say,

if you break them out, there are 15 just in

Three additional factors added by the

that what the district court did here is more

than sufficient.

8

record that it had considered the relevant

9

factors under 3553(a).

10

The court made clear on the

It had considered the

factors in the policy statement.

11

The court was familiar with the case

12

by virtue of having handled the original

13

sentencing and imposed a sentence that is

14

reasonable and for that reason should be

15

upheld.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TODD A. COBERLY
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. COBERLY:

I'm surprised that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

government suggests that Rita or -- excuse

2

me -- Taylor does not apply in the sentencing

3

context.

4

Taylor, it has been in the sentencing context.

5

This Court has relied specifically on

The times this Court has relied on

6

Taylor in Rita in stating, "The sentencing

7

judge should set -- set forth enough to satisfy

8

the appellate court that he has considered the

9

parties' arguments and has a reasoned basis for

10

exercising his own legal decision-making

11

authority.

12

Nonetheless, when a judge decides simply to

13

apply the Guidelines to a particular case,

14

doing so will not necessarily require lengthy

15

explanation."

See e.g. United States v. Taylor.

16

That's exactly all we're asking for.

17

And we understand that we're not asking for a

18

lengthy explanation but that when Congress has

19

channeled the exercise of the discretion of the

20

district court judge by directing it to

21

consider certain factors, the role of the

22

appellate court is to ensure that the district

23

court actually looked at those factors.

24
25

It's not that it's necessarily -- the
outcome is necessarily wrong but that it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

actually applied those factors in order to

2

comply with the directives of Congress.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

minimum that would suffice here?

5

MR. COBERLY:

What would be the

I think the minimum that

6

would be -- would suffice, Your Honor, in a

7

run-of-the-mill case is I looked -- I'm -- if

8

it's disproportionate, as it is here, the

9

reason I imposed a sentence of 114 months or

10

whatever it is, because of the seriousness of

11

the crime of, you know, the defendant's

12

involved in methamphetamine tracking -­

13

trafficking, something to that effect.

14

Again, I don't want to telegraph to

15

the district court what we think.

16

want to presume because we simply don't know.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

We don't

Well, you're asking us

18

to impose a standard.

And -- and you could -­

19

I -- I think it's entirely fair to ask you what

20

would be the minimum that would be required.

21

So you gave me an answer.

The judge

22

would -- if the judge made reference to

23

methamphetamine trafficking, that would be

24

enough?

25

MR. COBERLY:

I -- I think if -- if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

there was something that was tied to the

2

particular circumstances of the case, but,

3

again, I mean, the -- the reality here is

4

that's up to the appellate courts.

5

to the district court judge in the first

6

instance, and then it's up to the -- the

7

appellate courts to determine whether that was

8

sufficient reason to divine the -- the actual

9

reason of the district court judge.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's up

But in stating a

11

standard, you're essentially asking us to

12

repeat those words that you just read from

13

Rita, is that correct?

14

MR. COBERLY:

Exactly, Your Honor.

15

We're -- we're -- we're not asking anything

16

different than what Rita already requires.

17

And, Justice Alito, your -- your cite

18

to Taylor in -- in your dissent in Gall

19

recognized that the reason it's important for a

20

judge to state reasons to ensure that the

21

district court -­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

What Rita did say on

23

this point, I think -- point within the

24

guidelines that applied, the whole paragraph,

25

which you didn't really have time to read, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65
1

the paragraph there talks about sometimes a

2

judicial opinion responds to every argument;

3

sometimes it does not.

4

Sometimes a judge simply writes the

5

word "granted" or "denied" on the face of the

6

motion; other times the -- and the reasons make

7

everything clear.

8

law leaves much in this respect to the judge's

9

own professional judgment.

Sometimes they leave -- the

10

You have a borderline case.

11

-- I don't know whether more should be called

12

for.

13

way of resolving this.

14

way to resolve it would be to say you can write

15

pretty minimally, but the court of appeals can

16

ask for more if they need to.

17
18

And that's why I was looking around of a

MR. COBERLY:

I think that's exactly

right, Justice Breyer.

factors, something minimal.
