ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. DUPREE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The Railroad Retirement Tax Act levies

12

a payroll tax on railroad employees' money

13

remuneration.

14

case is whether remuneration in shares of stock

15

is remuneration in money.

16

The question presented in this

We believe it is not for a simple

17

reason.

18

of "money" is a generally accepted medium of

19

exchange.

20

buy -­

21
22

Stock is not money.

The plain meaning

And stock is not that.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

You can't

How about -- how

about a check?

23

MR. DUPREE:

We think a check would

24

constitute a medium of exchange, Justice

25

Kennedy.

It -- it essentially transfers

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

currency.

2

currency on a bank draft, so we do think that a

3

check would constitute money remuneration.

4
5

There is a legal right to obtain

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

slippery slope about that -- at that point?

6

MR. DUPREE:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8

So you end the

What about a bond, a

U.S. savings bond?

9

MR. DUPREE:

That would not be, Your

10

Honor.

11

money remuneration.

12

would constitute money remuneration obviously

13

would be cash, paper notes, coins, but it would

14

also encompass more modern ways of transferring

15

currency, such as direct deposit or a check.

16

We don't think a bond would constitute
Typically, the things that

We think that the plain meaning of

17

money remuneration is also confirmed when this

18

tax provision is viewed in the larger context

19

of the tax code as a whole, and that's true

20

both for the tax code as it existed during the

21

Great Depression, when this railroad statute

22

was enacted, and also the code as it exists

23

today.

24
25

The code -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dupree, wasn't

it -- wasn't it so that when the Act was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

enacted, compensation was in money, but over

2

time, compensation in the form of stock has

3

become more frequent.

4

purpose.

5

And it serves the same

So why can't one read "any form of

6

monetary compensation" to include any form of

7

compensation readily convertible into cash?

8
9

MR. DUPREE:

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

what the historical record shows is that at the

10

time of the Great Depression, when the statute

11

was enacted, railroad employees were actually

12

compensated through a variety of means, both

13

cash-based and also non-cash-based.

14

gave their employees everything from in-kind

15

benefits, free transportation, property.

16

so that same issue that presents itself today,

17

where railroad employees get a variety of

18

different types and forms of remuneration, also

19

existed back in the Great Depression.

20

Railroads

And

And what Congress did was it said we

21

recognize that railroad employees get a variety

22

of types of remuneration, including stock, by

23

the way, at that time, and yet it drew the line

24

in such -­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How common was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

stock at that time?

2

MR. DUPREE:

How common was it?

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

MR. DUPREE:

Yes.

It -- it was sufficiently

5

common.

There was a report cited in our papers

6

in the National Industrial Conference that

7

talked about how, going back to the 19th

8

century, many railroads offered stock purchase

9

plans to their employees.

So it certainly was

10

a well-recognized form of remuneration back

11

when the statute was enacted.

12

And I think if this Court were to

13

compare the language that Congress chose to put

14

in the railroad statute compared to what it put

15

in FICA, which was enacted virtually

16

simultaneously in the Great Depression, that

17

underscores our interpretation of money

18

remuneration.

19

FICA sweeps broadly.

As this Court

20

has noted, it encompasses all remuneration,

21

including -- and this is critical text -­

22

including any remuneration that is not in cash

23

but that can be valued in cash.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So not -­

Mr. Dupree, in the way

you talked about it, it's not just that we have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

to give meaning to the term "money."

2

you're quite right to say that the term we have

3

to look at is "money remuneration."

4

Is that correct?

5

MR. DUPREE:

6

I think

That's the key term, yes,

Your Honor.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so that's really

8

money in a -- in a compensation scheme, right?

9

I mean, that's what that means.

10
11

MR. DUPREE:

Remuneration.

Money remuneration.

That's right.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So let's even take

13

your own definition, which I think that there's

14

a lot to be said for.

15

of money tends to be the one that's first in

16

the dictionaries.

17

accepted medium of exchange.

18

Your definition tends -­

So you said a generally

But now you put that with the word

19

"remuneration", in other words, in a

20

compensation scheme, and then the question

21

becomes:

22

of exchange in a compensation scheme?

23

Is stock a generally accepted medium

And I would think that the answer to

24

that is yes.

I mean, we see this all over the

25

place, that companies give stock as well as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

cash in a compensation scheme, that it is a

2

generally accepted medium of exchange for

3

compensation.

4

MR. DUPREE:

Well, I'm not sure it -­

5

it quite works out that way, Justice Kagan.

6

other words, if a company remunerates its

7

employees through some form, say, for example,

8

free lunches, I don't think it would be right

9

to say, well, therefore, food has now become a

10

In

medium of exchange.

11

I think a medium of exchange -­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I think partly

13

it's because, you know, some companies might

14

give free lunches and other companies might not

15

give free lunches, and -- and you -- I mean,

16

this is -- this is a kind -- instead of getting

17

a check, you're getting stock.

18

right?

19

MR. DUPREE:

Isn't that

Well, you're getting a

20

stock option, which then needs to percolate for

21

many years -­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

MR. DUPREE:

24
25

Well -- right.

-- before it turns into a

butterfly and becomes stock.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you can -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

MR. DUPREE:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

But, yes.
-- you can take it in

4

stock.

5

Ninety-three percent of -- of some of these

6

companies' employees just take it in cash;

7

forget about the stock.

8
9

You can take it in cash.

So why isn't it just, you know, you
can get it in cash, you can get it as a stock

10

option or in stock when that matures; it's a

11

generally accepted medium of exchange?

12

MR. DUPREE:

Well, I -- I think a

13

generally accepted medium of exchange refers to

14

something that, number one, has a fixed value.

15

In other words, it's a measure of value.

16

it's something that any citizen could use to

17

obtain goods or services in an economy.

18

In other words, cash certainly

19

fulfills that function.

20

services with cash.

21

And

I can obtain goods and

If my employer -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's why -- I

22

mean, in your briefs, you keep on saying you

23

can't take a stock option to a grocery store.

24

But I think -- and that's obviously right.

25

But I think what I'm saying is that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

would be a relevant question if all we were

2

asking is what's the definition of money.

3

that's not what we're asking.

4

what's the definition of money remuneration.

5

But

We're asking

So the fact that you can't take a

6

stock option to a grocery store is irrelevant

7

to that question.

8

it comes to compensation, is a stock option

9

used interchangeably with money?

The question is that, when

And, I think

10

in this company and many others, it is.

11

it?

12

MR. DUPREE:

Isn't

Well, I -- I don't think

13

so.

14

shows that fewer than half the options at issue

15

were actually promptly exchanged for cash.

16

the record in this case shows that these

17

employees -- again, the majority of options at

18

issue were retained as stock.

19

sold for cash.

20

Certainly, in this company, the record

So

They were not

And -- and I think under Your -- Your

21

Honor's question, pretty much anything that

22

could be sold for cash would be swept into the

23

definition of money.

24

gives to an employee can be valued and could be

25

sold.

Anything that an employer

Granted, there are some things that are

more liquid than others.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, let me ask

3

another question, Mr. Dupree, just to test this

4

a little bit.

5

employees, and one employee makes $200,000 in

6

cash and is granted $5 million in stock-based

7

compensation.

8

million.

9

$250,000 in cash.

So let's say a company has two

Two hundred thousand plus five

And the other employee is just given

10

Now who makes more money?

11

MR. DUPREE:

Well, the -- in Your

12

Honor's -- context of Your Honor's question, I

13

think money is essentially synonymous with

14

overall wealth or assets.

15

definition of money.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that is a

Right.

So the answer

17

to my question is, of course, the guy who gets

18

the $5 million in stock makes more money.

19

MR. DUPREE:

But in -- in the context

20

of that question, I think that's fair.

21

think in the context of this tax statute, I

22

don't think it's right to say that when the

23

1937 Congress put the word "money" into this

24

tax statute, it meant it in that capacious

25

sense to include the value of everyone's assets

Well -­
I agree with you,
I don't

But why do we have to go as far as
you're going?
MR. DUPREE:

Well, I think, to answer

20

Your Honor's question about the Seventh

21

Circuit's analysis, the Seventh Circuit and

22

Judge Posner actually agreed with our

23

definition of money as a commonly accepted

24

medium of exchange.

25

Where he went awry in our view is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

concluding that in the year 2018 stock has

2

become a medium of exchange.

3

that's right.

4

economic authority for that proposition.

We don't think

He certainly cited no legal or

5

His point, I -­

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought Judge

7

Posner's main point was that there's no

8

economic difference to the recipient, whether

9

he gets $1,000 in cash in hand or a share of

10

stock that he can easily convert to $1,000.

11

MR. DUPREE:

Right.

And -- and our

12

response to that, Justice Ginsburg, is that,

13

again, taken to its logical conclusion, it

14

would mean that anything an employee gets is

15

money.

16

$10,000, in an economic sense, there may be no

17

difference between getting a car that is worth

18

$10,000 and getting $10,000 in cash.

If an employee is given a car worth

20

"money" in the statute, it did not mean to

21

sweep in anything, as the government says, that

22

can be valued or that can be sold.

23

way too far.

24
25

That goes

I think that -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you're

right, then Congress did a -- an idle thing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

when it specifically excluded from

2

compensation, subject to the tax, a qualified

3

stock option.

4

then there was no need for that.

5
6

If stock options were not money,

MR. DUPREE:

Well, a few points on

that, Justice Ginsburg.

7

The first is that the government

8

argues that that exemption is relevant to this

9

case because, in the government's view, it

10

essentially renders our definition -- or it

11

would render the provision surplusage under our

12

definition of money remuneration.

13

We think that's wrong, and the reason

14

why that's wrong is because, when an employee

15

exercises a qualified stock option, they always

16

get stock, but -- and this is the critical

17

point and one the government concedes -- they

18

often get cash as well.

19

That is why that (e)(12) exemption is

20

not surplusage under our reading.

21

work.

22

It does

I think it also bears mention that

23

that exemption was enacted in 2004, about 70

24

years after the original money remuneration

25

statute was enacted.

And I think it would be a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

little peculiar to say that in 2004 Congress

2

intended to change or to tamper with the

3

definition of money remuneration that, by the

4

way, has remained in that statute unaltered for

5

almost 70 years now.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Dupree, if we're

7

going to look back, as you're encouraging us to

8

do, further than 2004, why not look at 1938 and

9

the regulations that were promulgated then that

10

suggest that money remuneration is broader than

11

you're arguing?

12

MR. DUPREE:

Well, Justice Gorsuch, I

13

think actually that that original regulation

14

strongly supports our point.

15

regulation says, and this is the original IRS

16

regulation interpreting the statute, is it says

17

that the IRS is going to construe "money" to

18

include money or anything, and this is the

19

critical language, anything that can "be used

20

in lieu of money."

21

What that

And then they provide a host of

22

examples, most of which are salary, bonuses,

23

commissions, cash payments.

24

that original regulation strongly supports our

25

view because it underscores the IRS's original

So we think that

MR. DUPREE:

Well, what if we

Would you have any

Well, if -- if you read

it more broadly, I don't think you could read

10

it more broadly to encompass stock.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm sure you don't,

12

but let's just suppose we did.

13

MR. DUPREE:

Then what?

Well, then I would say

14

that that regulation was impermissible,

15

conflicts with the statute.

with history?

I was talking about the U.S.

You have the 1994 regulation by

23

Treasury, and you have your company and many

24

others paying this tax without saying anything

25

until very recently.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1
2
3

At what point do we say that history
supports one reading as opposed to another?
As the government points out, yes, you

4

can't perhaps change meaning with later

5

regulation, but later regulation can be a

6

reflection of what everyone has understood the

7

meaning to be.

8
9

MR. DUPREE:

Right.

And -- and,

Justice Sotomayor, I think it's fairly clear,

10

and I don't think the government disputes this

11

point, that for the vast majority of this

12

railroad statute's existence, the railroads

13

were not, in fact, paying tax on stock.

14

The government certainly hasn't said

15

we have evidence from the 1950s and 1960s that

16

this was being done.

17

regulation that Justice Gorsuch mentioned, it

18

would not be included.

19

And, in fact, under the

What the -- the government has

20

identified, and Your Honor alluded to this, is

21

that Railroad Retirement Board regulation that

22

actually first was issued by way of a decision

23

in 1938, and we think that's very telling,

24

because what the Railroad Retirement Board says

25

is it says, under the statutory language, we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

will only treat stock as remuneration if the

2

party, the employer and the employee agree to

3

do so, and that they can value it in advance.

4

None of that happened here.

5

the government is right that this Court should

6

look to the Railroad Retirement Board's

7

historic treatment of stock, we think that

8

strongly supports our position.

9

So, if

In fact, under a plain,

10

straightforward application of that regulation,

11

we win this case.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was the government

wrong in saying that at least for the last -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

to that question, the employees thought it was

taxable as well.

MR. DUPREE:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and -- and so

2

what effect do we give to this long-time

3

practice; even your -- your people in the

4

position of your own clients, until recently,

5

thought that it was taxable.

6

MR. DUPREE:

Well, again, I think the

7

history going back to the Great Depression up

8

and through the mid-'90s is, as a general

9

matter, the railroads were not paying tax on

10

this.

11

As far as what changed, in 1994, the

12

IRS came out with a new regulation, it's the

13

one that's currently on the books, which is a

14

peculiar regulation, in all honesty, because it

15

basically says we're going to treat FICA wages

16

and RRTA compensation to mean the same thing,

17

except where they differ.

18

But the IRS never, to this day, it

19

never has issued a regulation saying that stock

20

options and stock is taxable under the Railroad

21

Retirement Tax Act.

22

It has never said that.

So, in 1994, the IRS changed its

23

position.

It got rid of its long-standing

24

historic understanding that money remuneration

25

did not include stock, and it issued this new

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1
2

regulation.
At that point, there were several

3

years where I think parties, frankly, didn't

4

quite know what the state of the law was.

5

think it's right that there were some railroads

6

that paid tax.

7

just a judgment that, rather than litigate the

8

question, it was easier to pay the tax for a

9

few years.

10

I do

I suspect that may have been

But, in our case, the Petitioners in

13

years to vest.

It can be up to a 10-year term

14

in instances.

And in this case, we are seeking

15

refunds beginning with the 2006 tax year.

16

So, to the extent there was a period

17

in time where railroads were paying tax, does

18

that reflect a historical practice, I think the

19

answer is no.

20

handful of years in the overall 75- to 80-year

21

sweep of this railroad tax statute.

22

At most, it might have been a

We think that if this Court construes

23

the railroad statute's language against FICA,

24

that strongly supports our interpretation

25

because we are asking you to give meaning to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

the textual difference in the two statutes,

2

which were enacted virtually simultaneously in

3

the Great Depression.

4

Congress deliberately chose very

5

different language in establishing the tax

6

base.

7

And even though the railroad statute

8

and FICA have been amended numerous times in

9

the 80 years since, those words appear

10

unaltered today in the U.S. Code from the

11

moment they appeared when President Roosevelt

12

signed those bills into law.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MR. DUPREE:

15

Mr. -­

Congress has not changed

--

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dupree, just

17

asking a question, not about the text but about

18

reasons and purposes:

19

reason for why there should be a distinction

20

between FICA and the railroad system with

21

respect to stock options?

22

MR. DUPREE:

What would be your best

Absolutely, Justice

23

Kagan.

The reason why is, going back to

24

history and why Congress made the decision that

25

it did, it often, as this Court knows,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

legislates specifically for the railroad

2

industry.

3

The railroads, unlike all other

4

industries, had an existing pension system.

5

And so the distinction was written into the law

6

to reflect the historic practice in the

7

railroad industry.

8
9

When Congress made the decision to
federalize these railroad pensions, it said we

10

are going to federalize it, but we will

11

maintain the existing cash-based pension

12

structure that -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I understand the

14

government to be saying that that did exclude

15

certain kinds of things that were clearly not

16

cash-based, but -- you know, lunches or

17

something like that, but that's a different

18

question from the one I'm asking.

19

I'm just saying look at this thing,

20

stock options, and say why -- why would

21

Congress want it to be taxable in FICA but not

22

taxable in the railroad system?

23

MR. DUPREE:

Because the railroad

24

system -- retirement system is fundamentally

25

different in key respects from Social Security.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

It has much higher tax rates.

2

railroad combined tax rate is north of

3

30 percent, whereas FICA is about 14 percent.

4

The railroad retirement system also provides

5

for much more generous benefits to retirees.

6

I mean, the

So they are two fundamentally

7

different retirement systems.

8

similarities?

9

And in places -­

10

Yes.

Are there

Is there overlap?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

I guess I'm still

11

waiting for a difference that would -- would -­

12

would match why Congress would make this

13

different treatment of stock options.

14

MR. DUPREE:

Well, I -- I think the

15

different treatment of stock options traces

16

back to the original decision that Congress

17

made and that it has maintained now in the

18

statutory text for 70-plus years, the

19

distinction between a broad wage-based tax

20

system in FICA that encompasses pretty much

21

everything the employee gets and the far

22

narrower tax base that the railroad system

23

utilizes.

24
25

So I think it's just a natural
function that when Congress designed the tax

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

basis for these two retirement systems, among

2

many other differences between the two regimes,

3

it formulated the tax base in a much narrower

4

manner.

5

treatments for certain things, such as the

6

stock options in this case.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's why today there are different

It's a -­
I thought -- I

8

thought that the railroad pension system in the

9

1930s was at risk.

10
11

That was one of the reasons

why this scheme was developed.
Why would you base a new scheme

12

completely on the old scheme that was

13

underfunded to start with?

14

counterintuitive to me that Congress would want

15

to copy the old -- the old system, stock and

16

barrel, when it, as you say, already knew that

17

stock options were a part of -- of

18

remuneration.

19

MR. DUPREE:

It seems

Right.

The reason it

20

could address that concern, Justice

21

Sotomayor -- in other words, mirror the

22

existing cash-based pension structure in the

23

federal regime, is it could address questions

24

of solvency simply by adjusting benefits and

25

tax rates.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

In other words, it wanted to preserve

2

the overall structure, but it would adjust

3

benefit levels, it would adjust tax rates, and,

4

of course, there would be an underlying federal

5

guarantee.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's going to

7

happen now?

Every railroad is going to not

8

pay -- if we buy your argument, not pay taxes,

9

payroll taxes, on stock options.

Why don't

10

railroads move to giving out more stock options

11

and less cash?

12

MR. DUPREE:

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14
15

Well, I -- I -- I don't-­
And wouldn't that

put the system into economic difficulty?
MR. DUPREE:

It would not, Your Honor.

16

And a number of points.

17

the last point about putting the system in

18

economic difficulty, the railroad system

19

actually has a statute, a provision, that

20

self-adjusts based on the money coming in and

21

the benefits going out, to ensure that the

22

system remains solvent.

23

Your Honor's question is the statute -­

24
25

I guess with regard to

So the short answer to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The pensioners get

less, is what you're saying to me?

This

Heritage Reporting Corporation

self-adjusting system means that pensioners

2

will get less.

MR. DUPREE:

necessarily.

that the system hasn't -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So who pays is the

Joe Blow who gets minimum wage or something

13

close to it, and the people who receive a lot

14

more in stock options pay less?

15

MR. DUPREE:

I -- I -- well, no, I

16

don't -- I don't think that's right.

17

words, the -- the stock options in this case,

18

first of all, were not confined to a narrow

19

group of senior executives.

20

to rank-and-file employees, as well as senior

executives.

The other point is that the RRTA has a

24

only the first portion of an employee's

part, to this tax.

2

So, as a practical matter, it doesn't

have a dramatic impact on overall tax revenues.

4

In this case, the amount of tax -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't understand

6

that.

7

how are you going to pay out the same benefits?

8
9

If you get less money into the system,

MR. DUPREE:

Oh, and -- and my point

is that it may not be the -- less money going

10

into the system, as Your Honor is positing, and

11

that's because, if you have an executive who is

12

receiving a large salary and stock options,

13

they already exceed the compensation cap by

14

virtue of their salary alone.

15

they are getting stock on top of that makes no

16

difference because they're already maxing out

17

on the tax.

18

So the fact that

That's the point.

I think also, just as a practical

19

matter, I don't think railroads could move to a

20

pure stock-based compensation system for a

21

number of reasons.

19

MR. DUPREE:

That's -- that's right,

20

Justice Kennedy.

And actually, it's a great

21

question because the BNSF railroad, one of the

22

nation's largest employers, stock is no longer

23

publicly traded.

24

where a railroad that is not publicly traded

25

issues stock, and then you would have extremely

So you could have a situation

thorny valuation problems, because it's one

2

thing to say, well, we can calculate the value

3

of the stock based on market price, but if it's

will tell you, it can be a very difficult

endeavor.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If I get a bonus or the employee

MR. DUPREE:

I -- I'm not aware of

13

that, Your Honor.

The way that the options in

14

this case worked is that the exercise price is

15

determined at the moment the option is issued.

16

So, if in year zero the stock is trading at

17

$100, that's the so-called strike price that

18

you can purchase the stock for five, six,

19

seven, eight years down the road.

20

And I think, frankly, that also -­

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But is the strike

22

price always equivalent to the price on the day

23

that the option is issued?

24
25

MR. DUPREE:

Yes, yes.

The day the

option is issued, that's when they set the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

strike price.

2

my answer to one of Justice Kagan's earlier

3

questions, I think that's yet another respect

4

in which stock is fundamentally different from

5

money.

6

And I think -- just to conclude

It's an investment property.

The

7

value fluctuates.

When these options were

8

issued, no one had any idea what they would be

9

worth.

Maybe they'd be worth nothing five, 10

10

years down the road when the option has vested

11

and it's exercised.

12

property with fluctuating value, stands in

13

sharp contradistinction to cash, which has a

fixed value.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RACHEL P. KOVNER

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

23
24
25

MS. KOVNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Three parts of this statute

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1

demonstrate that the phrase "any form of money

2

remuneration" refers to those payments that can

3

be readily valued in or converted to cash.

4

first is the statute's text.

5

exclusions for particular kinds of stock

6

options and for in-kind benefits that only make

7

sense if the statute's money remuneration

8

language is given a broad scope.

9

The

The RRTA contains

Second are the contemporaneous

10

interpretations of the statutes.

11

predecessor legislation and the agency's

12

earlier regulations construed "any form of

13

money remuneration" broadly to reach non-cash

14

benefits like the stocks here.

15

Both

And the third is the statute's

16

objective of providing a financially stable,

17

self-supporting retirement system for railroad

18

workers.

19

employers could avoid taxes by paying employees

20

in stock, a highly liquid asset that serves as

21

the functional equivalent of cash for

22

employees.

23

That objective would be undermined if

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

does it work?

25

worker get the remuneration?

How does it -- how

When does the -- the railroad
When he gets the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1
2

stock option or only when he cashes it?
MS. KOVNER:

It's only -- only when he

3

exercises it.

4

important point that goes to what Mr. Dupree

5

was just discussing, which is that stock

6

options are only treated as compensation at the

7

moment when they have a readily discernible

8

cash value.

9

And I think it's a really

So not at the moment that they're

10

issued, but only at the moment that the

11

employee exercises them.

12

they have a 100 percent certain cash value.

13

And you can see that by looking at the record

14

in this case.

And at that moment,

15

An employee at the company in this

16

case, when they exercised the stock option,

17

there's a one-page form, which is Exhibit 78 in

18

the record below.

19

instead of stock, they just check a box on the

20

form and say:

21

this option to my bank account.

22

If they simply want cash

Please deposit the cash value of

So these options are only valued at

23

the moment when they have a readily discernible

24

cash equivalent.

25

If I can just go to a few of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

issues that Mr. Dupree discussed.

2

first is the qualified stock option exemption.

3

And this exemption was added to the statute by

4

Congress, and it exempts one particular type of

5

stock option.

6

signaling that Congress was understanding that

7

other kinds of stock options were going to be

8

subject to taxation under the RRTA.

9

I mean, the

So it -- it is obviously

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. -- Ms. Kovner, in

10

what circumstances do you think we are allowed

11

to look at what is clearly the natural import

12

of that exemption?

13

exemption came about later, so do we have to

14

find that "money remuneration" is an ambiguous

15

phrase in order to look at it, or do we take

16

the statute as a whole just generally?

17

In other words, that

MS. KOVNER:

I think, you know, what

18

this Court has said about this in West Virginia

19

University Hospitals versus Casey is that the

20

Court adopts the permissible meaning that fits

21

most logically and comfortably with both the

22

previously enacted and the subsequently enacted

23

provisions.

24
25

So here we think the only meaning that
fits with both -- I mean, Mr. Dupree

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

acknowledged when he stood up that money can

2

have this broader reading that readily

3

encompasses stock.

4

that fits with the qualified stock option

5

exemption.

6

And that's the only meaning

It's also the only meaning that fits

7

with many other exemptions that Congress added

8

for things that just aren't cash, like for

9

lodging, like for healthcare benefits, like for

10

employee achievement awards, intangible

11

property.

12

the statute extends beyond cash.

13

These exceptions only make sense if

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

May -- may I ask:

14

Was Mr. Dupree right about the history, that it

15

wasn't -- from 1938 to 1994, railroads were not

16

paying on -- cash on options?

17

MS. KOVNER:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19
20

I don't -­
Or not paying

payroll taxes on cash -- cash options?
MS. KOVNER:

I haven't seen any

21

authority on one side or the other regarding

22

very early in the statute's history.

23

we do know, and you can see, you know, page 7

24

of our brief is where we discuss cases that

25

recount this history.

I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

We do know that some employees have

2

been paying taxes on stock options for quite

3

some time.

4

They start issuing options in 1981, and they

5

pay taxes until 2007, when they file suit.

6

So Union Pacific is one example.

So 2011 is the first time that we see

7

a suit challenging whether stock options are

8

taxable under the RRTA and -- and Union Pacific

9

and other railroads were filing -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How -- what do I

11

do with the fact that where I'm having

12

difficulty making the leap in your argument is

13

Congress did use "money remuneration" in one

14

statute and "wages" defined very broadly in

15

another.

16

That was in 1938.
Generally, when you have two different

17

descriptions of words, you have to give them

18

two different meanings of some sort.

19

MS. KOVNER:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

Sure.
So what do I do

with that?

22

MS. KOVNER:

So -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're now

24

equating money remuneration with wages as it

25

appears in FICA, but there -- why weren't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

identical words used?

2

MS. KOVNER:

Sure.

So -- and we agree

3

that money has to be given some meaning.

4

we think that Congress was doing something

5

deliberate when it used money in the RRTA but

6

didn't include parallel language in FICA.

7

And

And at the time that the RRTA was

8

enacted, railroad workers -- and it's discussed

9

in the history and the hearings leading up to

10

the enactment of the RRTA -- they received a

11

variety of benefits that were sort of hard to

12

value, couldn't readily be assigned a monetary

13

value.

14

right to have certain safety gear on the job

15

and an unlimited but non-transferable sort of

16

lifetime use of the rail's travel benefit.

17

And these included things like the

So these are things that would have

18

been hard to value, and we think the use of

19

money carves those out of the RRTA, whereas

20

they weren't carved out with FICA.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You -- you

22

would agree, wouldn't you, that not every form

23

of stock qualifies under your definition?

24
25

Justice Kennedy mentioned non-publicly
traded stock.

I suppose there are some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

entities in which their stock is particularly

2

volatile, I mean, you can expect it to change

3

between the time you get the options or the

4

actual stock and -- and when you liquidate it.

5
6
7

How are we supposed to tell which
stock counts and which doesn't?
MS. KOVNER:

Sure.

So this is an easy

8

case and the Court obviously needs not go

9

further than publicly-traded stock.

10

But as with respect to

11

privately-traded stock, we think that's covered

12

too, and here's why.

13

-- private -­

14

So it's true that public

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

When you say

15

covered too, you mean that counts as money

16

remuneration?

17

MS. KOVNER:

It's -- that's right.

18

And it counts as money remuneration only at the

19

time that you exercise the option.

20

be that that stock is more volatile than a

21

publicly-traded stock, but it has a certain

22

value on the date you exercise the option, and

23

that's the only value that you look to.

24
25

So it might

Somebody's going to have to value that
privately-traded asset for the purpose of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

income tax.

2

income that's equal to the value of that stock.

3

And so we think once they're valuing it for

4

income, it also has a readily discernible

5

market value for the purpose of the RRTA.

6

They're going to have to declare

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Why would you wait

7

until the day of exercise, though, if it -- why

8

not the date of vesting, and -- and what -- I'm

9

still not clear on what you do with

10

privately-held stock that is not readily -­

11

there's no liquid market value that you can

12

look to at any point in time.

13

MS. KOVNER:

Sure.

So, with respect

14

to the first point, we think that options like

15

those that are issued in this case only have a

16

readily ascertainable market value at the time

17

that they are exercised.

18

there tend to be limitations on the options,

19

like -­

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And that's because

Almost anything can

reduced to money.

23

other than it's convenient for the government?

24
25

I mean, anything can be
So why -- why -- why wait,

and it's also the same set of principles that

are applied for valuing options under the

And there's a

It starts with this

And that sort of body of law says, for
the kinds of options that are issued here in

10

the employment context, there are just too many

11

conditions and conditions -- contingencies on

12

whether you're going to be able to exercise the

13

option at all and what its value will be at the

14

time of exercise.

15

To assign it -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, no, once it

vests, it's different.

17

that you will be able to exercise it.

just when.

later, but it vests, so you immediately at that

point in time have the right to exercise it on

looks to, first, the point of issuance and,

6

second, the point of -- the point at which you

7

exercise the option.

8

I think the IRS has sort of made the

9

determination, applying this Court's decision

10

in Commissioner versus LoBue, that those are

11

the two points that you look to.

12

And the IRS has generally said at the

13

point that the option is issued -­

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
Fine.

So more regulations.

15

Okay.

16

general problem, though, that lots of companies

17

issue lots of things to their employees that

18

are forms of compensation that can be reduced

19

readily to money?

20

And what do we do about the more

You mentioned lifetime passes for

2

MS. KOVNER:

So I think there are -­

3

our definition of money remuneration basically

4

has two pieces:

5

valued into cash and, second, can it be readily

6

converted into cash?

7

First, can it be readily

We think that either suffices, but at

8

a minimum, we think the second, which is what

9

you have here and not in those other cases,

10
11

suffices.
So, if it's something that you can

12

easily convert into cash, here just by sort of

13

checking a box on the form when you exercise

14

the option, we think at a minimum those kinds

15

of things qualify as money remuneration, which

16

is sort of what the Court of Appeals said.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

A home computer?

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What about

19

bushels -- bushels of wheat?

20

convertible into cash on the Chicago

21

Commodities Exchange.

22

20 bushels of wheat, you would count that as

23

money remuneration?

24
25

MS. KOVNER:

It's readily

So, if somebody gave you

Well, I don't think

that's readily convertible to cash for the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

person who receives it.

2

are certain circumstances in which a person

3

could buy or sell bushels of wheat.

4

It's true that there

But, certainly, the employee who

5

receives a bushel of wheat in their

6

compensation, if that were to occur, can't

7

readily convert it into cash in the same way

8

that they can convert an option.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

I mean, I suppose your

answer would -­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, okay,

12

they give you a little -- they say, okay, here,

13

you're entitled to buy 20 bushels of wheat on

14

the commodity exchange.

15

money remuneration?

16
17

MS. KOVNER:
bushels of wheat?

Does that count as

Well, a voucher for

I'm not -­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

MS. KOVNER:

Right.

Sure.

I think the

20

problem is that that voucher for bushels of

21

wheat is not going to be something that you -­

22

that the employee can readily convert into

23

cash.

24
25

If you -- if you do get to the point
where we're talking about vouchers that -- that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

do have a readily ascertainable market value, I

2

think it's a pretty helpful example to us

3

because, if you look to the 1938 regulation

4

that Justice Gorsuch was alluding to, it gives

5

a pretty expansive definition of money

6

remuneration and it indicates that it includes

7

things like merchandise orders, which I think

8

is perhaps somewhat equivalent to the bushels

9

of wheat voucher.

It's something that you

10

could exchange for -- for a commodity at the

11

company's store.

12

I mean, that kind of thing is less

13

liquid than -- than stock, which anybody can

14

convert to cash and which is used as a means of

15

exchange in a variety of circumstances.

16

predominant medium of exchange now in many

17

corporate contexts and employee compensation

18

matters.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's a

Ms. Kovner, would your

20

answer to the Chief Justice's question be

21

different if a -- if a company said you can

22

take a bushel of wheat or its equivalent in

23

cash value?

24
25

MS. KOVNER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean,

I think there it's -- it's -- and that's, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

think, more analogous to here, where

2

essentially the employee can check a box on a

3

form and they're just receiving cash.

4

essentially instantaneous conversion into cash.

5

It -- I mean, and I think going to the

It's

6

purpose of the statute and what I think, you

7

know, this Court has indicated in United States

8

versus Silk is how this statute should be

9

construed.

I mean, this is a statute that's

10

intended to provide a self-sustaining system of

11

retirement benefits for railroad workers, and

12

if an employer -­

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Except Mr. Dupree

14

told us that there -- there isn't any real

15

jeopardy to the system if these stock options

16

were not subject to the -- to the tax.

17

MS. KOVNER:

So I don't think -- with

18

respect, I don't think that the points that Mr.

19

Dupree was making are exactly correct, and if I

20

could explain why.

21

Mr. Dupree's first response was that

22

the tax rate self-adjusts under the RRTA.

23

That's true for the second tier of the RRTA,

24

the sort of supplemental pension benefit

25

system.

It's not true for Tier 1, which is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

fundamental equivalent of Social Security.

2

For Tier 1, you've got the same tax

3

rate as FICA, and you're guaranteed the same

4

benefits level as FICA.

5

strange to imagine that Congress would have

6

thought you could have the same tax rate and

7

the same benefits but a much smaller tax -- tax

8

base.

9

So I think it's very

And I think the other thing that Mr.

10

Dupree said as to why it's not going to

11

undermine the RRTA's system is that high-level

12

employees are going to max out on their

13

compensation.

14

matter how their options or how stock-based

15

compensation is treated.

16
17
18

So it's not really going to

And I don't think that's exactly right
for two reasons.
The first is only part of the RRTA tax

19

maxes out.

The part that funds Medicaid does

20

not max out.

21

nothing to stop an -- an employer from

22

converting all of their railroad's compensation

23

of a high-level executive to cash.

24

it's not uncommon for a CEO to get $1 in cash

25

and the rest of their payment in stock.

And the second is that there's

I mean,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is a third -- a

2

third possibility that the employee waits until

3

after he or she retires and doesn't receive the

4

big salary and then exercises the option?

5

MS. KOVNER:

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7
8
9

The -­
Or -- or is that

unrealistic?
MS. KOVNER:

You know, it's -- it's

possible that there are some options that don't

10

get taxed for that reason, but, obviously, if

11

the Court were to say that any payment that a

12

company makes to its employees over the

13

duration of their career that takes the form of

14

stock is not taxable, that's posing a -- a

15

threat to the railroad retirement system.

16

You know, I think if the Court has

17

doubts about how the term "any form of money

18

remuneration" is -- is construed, ambiguity in

19

the word "money," I think the surrounding

20

language is helpful.

21

suggests that the -- the Congress was intending

22

a broader meaning of the term "money."

23

then the -- and then the exceptions that

24

Congress added to the statute are really

25

incompatible with Petitioners' definition.

There's -- "any form of"

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
47
1

And then the contemporaneous

2

interpretations of the statute by both the RRB

3

and the Treasury Department are both broad.

4

And Congress amends the statute repeatedly

5

against the backdrop of those interpretations.

6

So whatever doubt one has about the -­

7

you know, whether those interpretations were

8

too broad to begin with, once Congress

9

repeatedly amends the statute and doesn't

10
11

change that base definition of compensation -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I guess I'm not sure

12

how the regulations help you.

13

recent regulation says, effectively, that money

14

is whatever money is under the statutes.

15

I mean, the more

That -- that doesn't do much work, it

16

seems to me.

17

chose to replace the 1938 regulation, that

18

might or might not be more helpful to the

19

government, we can debate that, seems to me a

20

lost opportunity for the government.

21

And the fact that -- that the IRS

MS. KOVNER:

No?

I mean, I think that if

22

-- if the regulation had provided a lot greater

23

clarity and discussed stock in particular,

24

obviously, that would have been helpful.

25

think the regulations are still helpful in two

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We

Official
48
1

ways.

2
3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

How is the existing

regulation helpful to the government?

4

MS. KOVNER:

Sure.

So the existing

5

regulation talks about specific limitations in

6

the statute as -- as being the way in which the

7

RRTA and FICA differ today.

8

only reasonable way to read "specific

9

limitations" is that it's talking about the

And we think the

10

enumerated exceptions, which are different

11

under the statute.

12

If you look at the preamble, I mean,

13

that's what the agency explains that it's

14

doing.

15

exceptions have come into the statute, which

16

deal with the kinds of hard-to-value benefits

17

that were being addressed by money in the first

18

instance, the statutes really have parallel

19

meaning.

20

It's saying that now that all these

And I think the agency also points out

21

that the statutes now function in parallel in

22

that they guarantee the same level of benefits

23

under Tier 1 and have the same tax rate under

24

-- under Tier 1.

25

those things in tandem.

So it makes sense to construe

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't know.

2

That doesn't help me because, if you're

3

equating, as the current regulations do, the

4

railroad money remuneration with FICA's wages,

5

what do we do -- FICA requires you to value a

6

hard-to-value stock option, and you're telling

7

me it's not required under money remuneration.

8

MS. KOVNER:

No, we think -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So I'm not quite

10

sure how you can equate it when you yourself

11

have recognized the major difference.

12

MS. KOVNER:

So we think that options

13

would be treated the same under FICA as they

14

are under the RRTA -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's easy

16

because it's publicly traded, it's the known

17

value.

18

it seems to be equating money remuneration

19

completely with wages.

20

-- you're not.

21

But the way the regulation is reading,

MS. KOVNER:

But you're suggesting

And we think "money" does

22

some work, we think -- but we think the work

23

that "money remuneration" is doing in FICA -­

24

in the RRTA is now basically covered by

25

enumerated exemptions under FICA.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

So, basically, Congress comes in

2

and they add exceptions for things like de

3

minimis benefits and fringe benefits.

4

kinds of things that were generally falling in

5

that money bucket under the RRTA, Congress sort

6

of acknowledges that there's a lack of clarity

7

about how those things are going to be treated

8

under FICA, and it enacts a variety of very

9

specific provisions that handle those things.

The

10

So that's why we think the agency was

11

reasonable in construing those statutes in

12

tandem.

13

But, of course, the Court doesn't need

14

to reach the question of whether all kinds of

15

in-kind benefits are treated exactly the same

16

under FICA and the RRTA.

17

presents is whether stock options, which are a

18

form of remuneration that are readily

19

convertible to cash, qualify as money

20

remuneration.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -­
If we were -­

-- and, Ms. Kovner -­
If we were to

agree with you, we would have to assume that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

whoever wrote this statute was told we want you

2

to include money remuneration and stock

3

remuneration; and he said, well, a good way to

4

do that would be to say "money remuneration."

5

Right?

6

that, aren't you?

7

You're -- you're asking us to accept

MS. KOVNER:

I -- I don't think

8

exactly.

I mean, I think, as my friend on the

9

other side acknowledged, "money" has -- has,

10

and had at the time of the statute's enactment,

11

a broader use as well as a narrow one.

12

broader use, we think, encompasses stock.

13

I think some ways the Court can see that that

14

broader use existed is looking, not only to

15

dictionary definitions, but also to the

16

predecessor versions -­

Well -­

-- of the statute.
-- I'm not -­

20

I'm not saying there isn't a broader use and

21

someone might understand it, but I think if you

22

wanted to be even close to being clear, or

23

reasonably clear, and you want to include both

24

money and stock, you wouldn't pick the phrase

25

"money."

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MS. KOVNER:

I think -­

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You would

3

either say "money and stock," or you might say,

4

as you suggested, is something readily

5

reducible -- ascertainable value readily

6

reducible to cash.

7

MS. KOVNER:

It's not clear that

8

"stock" was, you know, necessarily at the

9

forefront of the drafters' mind.

I do think

10

that the drafters used "money" in the phrase

11

"any form of money remuneration" in a broader

12

sense.

13

of the provisions that Congress put forward in

14

-- in sort of the various versions.

15

And you can see that through the text

So there were versions that included a

16

carveout for various in-kind benefits.

17

enacted 1935 version of the statute also

18

included a carveout for one kind of in-kind

19

benefits, for free transportation.

20

it's clear from those sort of versions of the

21

language that Congress put forward that it

22

understood "money" was being used in a broad

23

sense.

24
25

And the

So I think

And -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I thought -- I

thought you might have answered the Chief

remuneration.

about a C minus on the drafting.

-- if -- if Congress had

7

spoken directly to stock one way or the other,

8

either said it's in or it's out, we wouldn't be

9

here today, but I think the only reasonable

10

interpretation of the word "money" as it was

11

used in the statute, particularly given the

12

regulations and Congress's ratification of

13

those regulations and all of the exceptions

that Congress has added since, is that it

to accept that it's the most reasonable reading

of the statute -­

MS. KOVNER:

Fair enough.

We think

6

it's -- it's certainly the most reasonable

reading of the statute in light of its

8

language, in light of what happened since, and

9

in light of Congress's objective in providing a

self-sustaining employment system.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I -­

the later adopted exemptions change the meaning

of "money remuneration"?

MS. KOVNER:

I -- I don't think -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

17

MS. KOVNER:

How can they do that?

So I think what this

18

Court has said -- I mean, it said it in Casey,

19

it said it in Fausto, it's in the Scalia and

20

Garner treatise, is that when this Court

21

interprets statutes, if there's an ambiguous

22

term in the early statute and then later

23

provisions get enacted that shed light and make

24

clear that Congress is acting on the

25

understanding that it's the broader form of -­

of the term that was used, then you construe

the statutes together.

that makes sense of both provisions, rather

that you're just saying that -- that the how

and exactly -- the -- the method by which this

is understood as taxable in this context is the

18

same as in the income tax context?

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS H. DUPREE, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. DUPREE:

Thank you.

Just a few

10

points.

11

needs to construe this tax provision in the

12

context of the code as a whole.

13

numerous provisions in the code, both as it

14

existed during the Great Depression but also as

15

it exists today, that makes clear that when

16

Congress uses the word "money" in a tax

17

statute, it does not mean stock.

18

The first is this Court obviously

We identify

I think that if this Court were to

19

reach the conclusion that, in the context of a

20

tax statute, the word "money" can encompass

21

stock, I think that could have pretty

22

significant spill-over effects to the dozens,

23

if not hundreds, of places in the code today

24

that use the word "money."

25

The second -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How many of those

2

other code provisions use the words "money

3

remuneration" as opposed to just "money"?

4

MR. DUPREE:

They -- they don't,

5

Justice Sotomayor, but at the same time, I

6

think "money remuneration" can simply be

7

understood as remuneration in money, which, of

8

course, begs the question as to, well, what's

9

money?

10

And our point is that when Congress

11

puts the word "money" in a tax statute, it

12

unambiguously excludes stock.

13

question about that in the current code and the

14

code as it existed back in the Great

15

Depression.

16

There's no

The second point is to the extent the

17

government argues that anything that can be

18

valued and sold for cash falls within this

19

capacious definition of money is wrong because

20

I can think of many things that can be sold

21

faster for cash at a much lower transaction

22

cost, for example, baseball tickets.

23

If I have two tickets to the Nationals

24

and Rockies game, I can sell those and change

25

those into cash a lot faster than I could find

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

a broker and sell my shares of stock on a

2

market.

3

The third point I would make, and I

4

think it's apropos since Tax Day is almost upon

5

us, is the government, the IRS, requires that

6

we taxpayers pay our taxes in money.

7

not let taxpayers pay their taxes in stock.
