ORAL ARGUMENT OF GREGORY A. CASTANIAS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. CASTANIAS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

For three reasons, the Patent Trial

12

and Appeal Board is not authorized to issue

13

final written decisions on fewer than all of

14

the patent claims challenged by inter partes

15

review petitioners.

16

First, is the plain language of the

17

statute.

18

final written decision with respect to the

19

patentability of "any patent claim challenged

20

by the petitioner."

the context of the Act.

It requires the Board to issue a

review is instituted"?

3

MR. CASTANIAS:

If there is -- it's

The conditional was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. CASTANIAS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So

Please.
I'm not at all

15

clear what it is you're challenging here.

16

you challenging the Board's right to initiate

17

partial adjudications or are you challenging

18

the fact that they are not addressing all of

19

the claims in their final decision?

20

that you're actually asking us to review?

MR. CASTANIAS:

22

challenging the latter.

23

is focused on the language -­

What is it

Well, we are
Our question presented

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what is it

exactly that you want the Board to do with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

respect to the claims that it didn't grant

2

adjudication of?

3

MR. CASTANIAS:

We -- we believe that

4

Section 318(a) requires the Board -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you want them

6

to say we didn't grant review on these claims

7

because?

8

is valid with respect to these claims that we

9

didn't grant review?

10
11
12

Or do you want them to say the patent

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, I think it's

actually -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because the only

13

-- the only power they're given is to decide

14

the patentability of claims.

15

is it that you're asking them to do?

16

MR. CASTANIAS:

So what exactly

Well, Justice

17

Sotomayor, what we are asking the Board to do

18

is to say, in its final written decision, that

19

we are not finding, for example, claim 4 of the

20

ComplementSoft patent -- as they did in this

21

case, we are not finding that unpatentable.

22

That way, we can then appeal that decision -­

Ahh, you want to

get around Cuozzo.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's not what

Well, I don't see

10

what else you're trying to do, because what

11

will you do?

12

say the Board was wrong in not instituting

13

review of those other claims?

14

Cuozzo was about, us saying you can't do that.

You will come up on appeal and

That's what

15

I didn't agree with Cuozzo, so -­

understand that.

22

(Laughter.)

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- but -- but

24

it is what we said.

And -- and so, assuming I

25

stick with precedent on this issue, what other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

purpose would there be for the Board basically

2

to say we made a decision not to institute

3

review?

4

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, first of all,

5

Justice Sotomayor, if you look at what the

6

Board actually did in saying that they were not

7

going to institute review, the Board

8

effectively did make a patentability

9

determination in what it calls its initial

10

determination.

11

Patent -- the Patent Trial and Appeal Board

12

that has, in fact, ruled on the question, but

13

because of the way they have ruled on it, we

14

can't appeal it and it can't be estopping.

15

--

16
17

So we have a decision by the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

And

You do

want to get around Cuozzo.

18

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, it's -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because there is

20

absolutely no way that that's anything other

21

than that.

22

challenging their decision not to institute

23

review, why would that make any difference?

24
25

What's the -- if you're not

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, Justice Breyer's

opinion for the Court in Cuozzo was very clear

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

in saying that the -- that the determination in

2

that case was a challenge under the Section

3

314(a) institution only.

4

We're not challenging the Section

5

314(a) institution; what we're saying is that

6

whatever institution means, whatever

7

institution means when the Board says we're

8

only instituting as to these particular claims,

9

it doesn't take into account the fact -- and

10

this was not addressed in Cuozzo -- that 318(a)

11

by its terms, by its text, requires a final

12

written decision.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So would the

14

review on appeal be on the basis of a motion -­

15

like a motion to dismiss?

16

whatever you presented the Board with, at the

17

beginning, did the Board have a reasonable

18

basis to conclude that no reasonable basis

19

existed to challenge the validity of that

20

claim?

21

MR. CASTANIAS:

On the face of

No, the review would

22

not be over the reasonable basis or not.

23

review would be on the question of

24

patentability.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

So how could we -­

how could the appellate court make that

2

determination if there's no record with respect

3

to that issue?

Sotomayor, there actually -­

If the Board

12

didn't institute review of those claims, there

would be an incomplete record with respect to

those other claims.

MR. CASTANIAS:

that there are -- inter partes review is a -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's fine.

5

But if the Board didn't institute review of

6

those other claims, the other side has not had

7

an opportunity to present its evidence in

8

contravention of your expert.

9

You're asking the appellate court to

10

decide patentability on the basis of an

11

incomplete, undeveloped record.

12

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, we'll either ask

13

the appellate court to decide patentability or

14

at least decide that we made a case of

15

patentability that ought to be decided.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

MR. CASTANIAS:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

All right.

And -- and -­
So why don't you

get to the first issue at all?

20

MR. CASTANIAS:

Right.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What you really

22

want to say is the Board shouldn't institute

23

partial reviews; it should, if it finds -- I

24

think what you're saying is, once it determines

25

you have enough evidence to challenge one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

claim, it should hold a hearing on everything.

2

Because without that, you can't really decide

3

patentability in a due process way, in a fair

4

way.

5

So why have you limited your challenge

6

in the way you have?

7

doing that?

8

you?

9

What's the purpose of

And what advantage does that give

It seems to me that it's an unfair

10

advantage to the other side.

It's an unfair

11

advantage to the system.

12

argue what you really want to argue, which is,

13

I should have an opportunity to litigate all of

14

my claims?

So why don't you just

15

MR. CASTANIAS:

16

-- that is exactly our argument.

17

have the opportunity to litigate them in -­

18

Well, that's exactly

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We should

But the statute

19

precludes you from contesting the institution

20

decision.

21

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, the -- the

22

statute precludes me from contesting the

23

institution decision, but, Justice Ginsburg, I

24

think if we could move to the -- to the

25

regulation that the Patent Office issued in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

this case, that there -- that the government is

2

relying on.

3

What you see in the -- in the Federal

4

Register, at 77 Federal Register 48702, the

5

government considered the objection that

6

reviews ought to take place with regard to all

7

challenged patent claims.

8

And what you won't see in the Federal

9

Register, where the Patent Office took up this

10

regulation, is any reference to Section 318(a).

11

It was -- that section was never considered.

12

What we have under Section 318(a) is

13

Congress saying to us and to -- and to the

14

public that when an -- when an inter partes

15

review is instituted -- and -- and keep in mind

16

that that's a binary choice -­

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it's --and if

18

it's instituted and -- here, it was instituted,

19

but only on two of -- what -- what?

20
21
22

MR. CASTANIAS:

Nine out of the 16

claims.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Nine -- okay.

23

out of 16.

24

an inter partes review is instituted.

25

Nine

So that's -- so 318 relates to when

MR. CASTANIAS:

It's an if/then -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

it's an if/then.

2

instituted, then we're entitled to a decision

3

on all challenged patent claims.

4

It's a binary, that if it's

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And it's -­

If it's -- if it's

5

instituted on any one, then the decision has to

6

be on all 16?

7

MR. CASTANIAS:

8

on all 16, that's right.

9

318 says.

10
11

The decision has to be
That's what Section

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Even though the

only one that they're examining is one?

12

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, that is -- that

13

is a determination by the Board at the outset

14

that we apparently have not met a burden of

15

proof.

16

the scheme that the -- the Patent Office is

17

following right now is a system whereby we were

18

sued -- we were sued in a complaint by

19

ComplementSoft, in a complaint that alleged

20

infringement of -- and I quote the complaint,

21

"at least claims 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 10."

22

What we end up with under the -- under

We asked for review of all 16 claims

23

because of that "at least" language.

The

24

Patent Office then only reviewed a certain

25

number of the claims, and then, in their

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

infringement contentions in this case,

2

ComplementSoft asserted every single claim in

3

the patent against us but claim 4.

4

And so, now, what we're left with is a

5

situation whereby we are in the Patent Office,

6

fighting for years in the inter partes review

7

over the patentability of nine of the 16

8

claims, and then we're going to have to go back

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Castanias, can I

5

your position on canceled claims?

6

MR. CASTANIAS:

Uh-huh.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I understand your

8

position on canceled claims, it's that the

9

Board need not render a decision as to those

10

claims.

Is that right?

11

MR. CASTANIAS:

That's right.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I guess what's the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I understand

8

there's a practical difference, but I was

9

looking for -- because you say that your view

10

is commanded by the statute and particularly, I

11

think, by this phrase "challenged by the

12

petitioner."

13

But if you were right about the

14

statutory language, that would apply to

15

canceled claims as well?

the Petitioner in the original petition.

It was challenged by

time of the final decision.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

no longer in dispute.

22

MR. CASTANIAS:

And it is -- it is an

23

ex-claim.

It is no longer a claim.

There's

24

nothing -- there's nothing to adjudicate.

25

that's the -- that's the answer by the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official
17
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I think what the

2

Board would say is that the same thing is true

3

here, there's nothing to adjudicate because

4

they've said that it doesn't pass the

5

threshold, so they're not in the business of

6

adjudicating it.

7

MR. CASTANIAS:

But it's -- but it's

8

because they've said that, and that's not what

9

the statute says.

10

Now, it's -- our position -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what language in

11

the statute distinguishes between the canceled

12

claim and the non-instituted claim?

13

MR. CASTANIAS:

It is challenged by

14

the Petitioner -- and, actually, the word

15

"claim" would work as well because it's no

16

longer a patent claim.

17

It doesn't exist.

But there is -- the -- the chapter -­

18

the inter partes chapter of the America Invents

19

Act, Justice Kagan, tells a really -- it's a

20

very simple, straightforward, and I would dare

21

say elegant story.

22

scope of inter partes review in section 311.

23

Section 311 is entitled Inter Partes Review.

24
25

It starts by defining the

Section 311(b) is entitled Scope.

And

in that scope provision, it refers to what the

What does it require the petition to identify?

MR. CASTANIAS:

10

MR. CASTANIAS:

Justice Sotomayor, as

11

I was -- when I was engaging in colloquy with

12

Justice Ginsburg earlier and Justice Kagan, I

13

was talking about how the -- the statute tells

14

a really elegant story and -- and the way that

15

the inter partes review is supposed to work.

16

Once -- once a petition is filed, it is that

17

petition that is before the Board.

18

And Section 314, the one that you're

19

-- you're focused on, gives the director the

20

discretion to institute.

It's whether to

It's not whether to institute with

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, one of the

stories that the statute as written seems to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

tell is of great discretion to the Board with

2

respect to the institution decision.

3

MR. CASTANIAS:

Uh-huh.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It says you never have

5

to institute; it's your choice whether to

6

institute; you can't get review of the

7

institution decision, which is our Cuozzo case;

8

you get to write your own rules about the

9

institution decision, which is the -- the

10
11

rule-making delegation.
So it's a little bit odd to say, well,

12

here's the one thing you don't have discretion

13

over when it comes to institution:

14

say these claims but not those claims.

you can't

15

In a -- in a context in which Congress

16

said the institution decision is really for the

17

Board, it's a discretionary decision that lies

18

in its bailiwick, why should we carve out that

19

one thing?

20

MR. CASTANIAS:

Well, excuse me,

21

Justice Kagan, I think I would answer your

22

question by saying that the fact that that

23

discretion is imposed to grant or deny, whether

24

to grant, suggests very strongly as a textual

25

matter that there is not a further secret grant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1
2

of selective review at that point.
But, moreover, why -- why should it be

3

our choice?

4

entity that picks?

5

statutory language, we think, supports us.

6

ordinary principle that the petitioner or the

7

plaintiff in litigation is the master of its

8

complaint, we -- because so many of these cases

9

follow litigation, we know best what claims

10
11

Why -- why should we be the -- the
Well, obviously, the
The

we're likely to be facing in litigation.
And, finally, it serves exactly the

12

two purposes that the majority opinion of the

13

Court in Cuozzo identified for the inter partes

14

review system, which is it screens out bad

15

patents while bolstering valid ones.

16

What -- I mean, it's one of the

17

reasons why you don't have a lot of amicus

18

briefs on either side in this case, is that

19

we're actually in the position of saying, yes,

20

we would like -- we would like to be -- have

21

appellate review and be bound by an adverse

22

decision with regard to claims that the Patent

23

Office did not think met the standard for

24

institution.

25

But that's not -- that's not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

unreasonable, particularly in this case,

2

because as we pointed out in our reply brief on

3

the merits, the Patent Office in this case, the

4

Board, decided to institute review with respect

5

to claim 4, but not claim 2.

6

Claim 4 actually is identical to claim

7

2, except it contains an additional limitation.

8

Had we been given the opportunity to say to the

9

-- to either to the Board in the process of the

10

litigation leading up to a final decision or to

11

the Federal Circuit on appellate review, we

12

could have said:

13

claim 2 is going to fall with it.

14

-- there's no earthly reason why we should

15

confirm this claim or reject that claim but

16

allow the other claim to go into -­

17
18

Look, claim 4, if it falls,

trouble is I can't imagine how a statute is

supposed to work where you, objecting, say:

JUSTICE BREYER:

You may get.

17

They say -- now, it's up to the Patent Office.

18

And the Patent Office says, yeah, one, okay.

Now, what you're saying is because

20

there was one and nine they're never going to

is that I think that it makes -- it's very

16

practical to read the statute as we're reading

it.

18

I think it's -- I think the ambiguity is only

19

injected by the addition of the regulation that

20

the Patent Office has -- has introduced into

this, because you won't find a hint of partial

institution anywhere in the statute, and you

23

have some strong textual indicators against it.

That's why we say that even if we were

2

would still not be within the zone of

3

reasonableness with regard to the -- the scope

4

of the ambiguity.

5

But why would you write it this way?

6

For exactly the two reasons that you -- you

7

wrote for the Court in Cuozzo.

8

bad patents while bolstering valid ones.

9

IPR screens out

Look at what the Board did in this

10

case.

In their institution decision, which ran

11

22 pages, it's not -- it wasn't just a

12

determination like the statute anticipates.

13

was a full, written, reasoned decision, made in

14

very short order after three months.

15

moved all of the work that they could have done

16

at the end to this institution phase and said:

17

Yeah, we're not going to institute with regard

18

to claim 2 and claims 10 through 16.

19

It

The Board

But we've still got reasoned decisions

20

on that.

But those claims haven't been

21

bolstered, to use the words of -- of Cuozzo.

22

And the -- the decision by the Board to reject

23

our arguments ought to then, if we lose either

24

before the Board in the final written decision

25

or on appeal, it should estop us from

relitigating those issues in the federal

2

courts.

3

That was exactly the point of the

4

inter partes review statute, is to make

5

district court litigation simpler by allowing

6

the expert agency to do these types of

7

adjudications.

8

because of the first argument -- but they are

adjudications of a type that agencies may -­

I say that with trepidation

10

may make, and it streamlines the patent

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN C. BOND

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19
20

MR. BOND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. BOND:

Yeah.

In established inter partes

23

review, Congress gave the PTO an enhanced tool

24

to identify and revisit patent claims that it

25

has determined may not be patentable for

certain reasons, and it entrusted the agency

2

with determining when to use that tool and how

3

those proceedings should work in practice.

4

Petitioner's challenge to the scope of

5

the final written decision here, its argument

6

that it should have included more claims in the

7

final written decision, fails because the PTO

or the -- the Board here, as under delegated

9

authority, validly determined not to institute

on those claims.

instituted proceeding, and there's nothing in

12

the statute that requires the Board to

13

institute or to include in its final decision

14

claims that were never part of the proceeding

15

in the first place.

16

They were never part of the

Now, the crux of this dispute is, as I

17

think the prior colloquy illustrated, over the

18

partial institution decision.

19

partial institution decision here to institute

20

review, except as to claims 2 and 11 through

21

16, is not reviewable under Section 314(d) and

So it's actually not clear

that claim 4 is narrower than claim 2.

As we

broader in some respects.

determined claim 4 presents a -- a close

question.

15

That's a close

Claim 2 does not, as presented to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, that

16

doesn't seem to me -- I mean, I know we don't

17

have review of the decision which claims to

18

review, it doesn't seem to me like very

19

helpful, in terms of what the whole process was

20

supposed to accomplish.

21

MR. BOND:

So we think Congress vested

22

the Board with discretion of deciding in what

23

circumstances claims are closely-enough related

24

that granting a review on one may -- implies

25

that it makes sense to grant a claim on a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

related claim -- or grant review on a related

2

claim because they're so closely related.

3

Here, the Board determined that the

4

request for review on claim 2 failed because

5

the petition failed at the threshold.

6

didn't identify specific references in the

7

prior art that rendered claim 2 obvious over

8

the prior art.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now, that's a

Well, why couldn't

13

the Board just -- just say we -- we decline to

14

grant it unless you reduce the -- unless you

15

eliminate this claim?

16

MR. BOND:

So, we think the Board

17

could do that, and we think that the Board has

18

that authority to say we're denying review

19

across the board, but we -- and on Petitioner's

20

view, I think that he conceded that that -­

21
22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But then we can rule

against you, and there's no real problem.
MR. BOND:

We -- we could deny review

24

across the board, but if you tailor your

25

petition, we could grant review in that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

circumstance.

2

But that, we think, illustrates the

3

artificiality of the Petitioner's position that

4

the Board could get to the same result, just

5

through a more cumbersome, multistage process

6

of saying, we're not going to grant it this

7

way, but if you revise and resubmit, we will

8

then entertain your challenge.

9
10

Here, we understand that Congress
designed -­

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it doesn't

12

because the challengers might say, in that -­

13

in that event, we'll just go to the district

14

court.

15

We don't want -- we don't want it.
MR. BOND:

Sure, and they could do

16

that in this instance.

17

dissatisfied with the Board's decision about

18

the scope of review can say, you know what,

19

it's not worth our time, we can settle with the

20

-- the patent owner our -- our IPR dispute, we

21

can agree not to pursue it and can proceed in

22

litigation.

A challenger here who's

And if, as in this case, the alleged

24

infringer was sued in a -- in a district court

25

infringement case and then brings an I -- IPR

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

proceeding, there's no stay of the district

2

court proceeding, at least mandated by the

3

statute, so they can proceed in the district

4

court to litigate as they had -- already had

5

been doing.

6
7
8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I thought

roughly half of the proceedings were stayed?
MR. BOND:

As a matter of the district

court's discretion, I think a little over

10

50 percent of contested stay motions are

11

granted, but, of course, if it's the alleged

12

infringer who went to the IPR or went to the

13

PTO to ask for an IPR and then says, look, I'm

14

done with IPR, they wouldn't grant review on

15

the claims that I would like, they can go back

16

to the district court and say, I no longer need

17

a stay if one was granted in the first place,

18

let's proceed to litigate this here in this

19

infringement suit.

20

And so we think that the statute is

21

perfectly consistent with inter partes review

22

being conducted on a partial institution basis,

23

and at a minimum, as I think was discussed

24

earlier, no provision of the statute clearly

25

prohibits what the -- what the PTO is doing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

10

What is ambiguous about that?

11

MR. BOND:

So a couple of things.

12

First, we'd say, as Petitioner invited the

13

Court to do, read through the statute

14

sequentially.

15

11A of our brief in the appendix.

16

and see what -­

17

We set it forth starting at page

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that really

wasn't my question.

19

language by itself, where is there ambiguity?

20

MR. BOND:

If we look at that

Sure.

If -- if you look at

21

the four words, "challenged by the petitioner,"

22

in isolation, they don't answer any of the

23

questions about the scope of what we mean by

24

"challenged by the petitioner."

25

So, if you look at those four words in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

isolation, they don't tell you standing alone

2

challenged in an IPR proceeding or this IPR

3

to.

So we think it's actually

13

consistent with ordinary usage to say, at the

14

merits phase of a discretionary review

15

proceeding, that when you say, "challenged by

16

the petitioner," you mean within the merits

17

phase that the opening clause presupposes has

18

taken place.

19

When this Court grants certiorari -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

I put it -- I put it

21

my way because the word "any" is like Exhibit

22

Number 1 for a word, the scope of which is very

23

often ambiguous in a statute.

24
25

If you can eat any fish, you can eat
any fish.

Think about that one.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. BOND:

So -­

2

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now -­

4

now my -- my point is we have loads of statutes

5

where the word "any" has a scope and the scope

6

is determined by the context of the statute.

7

And so what I'm thinking in the back of my mind

8

is this is one of those, but as I say, don't

9

let me get off on a wrong foot.

10

MR. BOND:

So we do agree that any

11

encompasses anything within the scope that the

12

context of 318(a) and its broader context of

13

the scheme encompasses.

14

within the instituted proceeding.

So it's any claim

15

But just focusing on that word "any,"

16

I think it's actually helpful to look past the

17

language the Petitioner quotes to the -- the

18

end of 318(a).

19

challenged by the petitioner and any new claim

20

added under section 316(d)."

21

It says, "any patent claim

What "any" is doing here is not saying

22

this is an all-encompassing review provision

23

that requires the final written decision to

24

encompass anything in the universe.

25

something much more limited.

It's doing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The tail end of this sentence in

2

section 318(a) is simply clarifying that when

3

you get to the final decision, there are two

4

kinds of things the Board needs to address.

5

needs to address those claims that were

6

actually challenged within the instituted IPR,

7

if there are any left, and it needs to address

8

any substitute claims added by amendment or

9

proposed to be added by amendment under 316(d),

10

It

if there are any.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

If Congress wanted to

12

say what you think this means, why in the world

13

would they phrase it the way it is phrased in

14

318(a)?

15

the patentability of any claim found by the

16

director to have at least some likelihood of

17

success?

Or any claim on which review was

18

granted?

Why in the world would they say any

19

patent claim challenged by the petitioner?

20

Why wouldn't they say with respect to

MR. BOND:

Well, two points, Your

21

Honor.

There are several things that can cause

22

a claim not to be in the case by the end.

23

fact that the PTO or the PTAB on delegated

24

authority didn't institute is one, but also

25

canceled claims and also settled claims.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official
42
1

Parties can settle not just the entire dispute

2

but also their dispute over individual claims.

3

Any of those things would mean that

4

the claim is no longer challenged by the

5

petitioner at the time of the final decision.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

It doesn't actually

7

have to mean that.

I just thought there's

8

another tack here, that if you're voting in

9

Congress on this, you actually don't know what

10

you think of in respect to the answer to this

11

question we are now litigating.

12

And since you don't know, the best

13

answer, from the point of view of the agency,

14

you use a word like "any" and "any claim," as I

15

say, filled with ambiguity, so that the agency

16

can decide which way it wants to go.

17

any indication of that?

18

MR. BOND:

Is there

So we -- we do think that

19

Congress, indeed, left these matters to the

20

agency in 316(a).

21

that was presented in Cuozzo.

22

provision in Cuozzo specifically addressed the

23

claim construction standard.

24
25

It's just like the question
No statutory

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but

that's -- so you're saying, if I understand

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

your answer to Justice Breyer, that Congress

2

deliberately adopted an ambiguous term in the

3

statute so that the agency would determine what

4

it meant.

5

It's one thing to say, you know, the

6

agency should determine which patent claims

7

challenge it will decide in -- or which ones

8

that aren't decided will be considered?

9

another thing to decide let's pick a word

It's

10

that's so vague that nobody will be able to

11

figure it out, and we'll leave it to the

12

Commission.

13

MR. BOND:

No, and let -- let me be

14

clear.

15

on purpose a deliberately ambiguous statute.

16

Our point is that the statute Congress enacted

17

is consistent with partial institution.

18

the extent there's a question about that,

19

Congress left those questions to the agency.

20

Our point is not that Congress enacted

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But to

Well, there is one

21

very telling sign that the "any patent claim

22

challenged by the petitioner" has a different

23

meaning, and that's in 314 itself, which says

24

"claims challenged in the petition."

25

If Congress intended claims challenged

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

in the petition to be a part of 318, it could

2

have used exactly the same words.

3

MR. BOND:

That's exactly right.

And

4

that, I think, is the second answer to Justice

5

Alito's question, the reason to think that

6

Congress intended this result is that Congress

7

used this very phrase that would encompass

8

Petitioner's position in a different phrase of

9

the statute.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you think

11

"challenged by the petitioner" is narrower than

12

-- I'm sorry, any change -- "any patent claim

13

challenged by the petitioner" is narrower than

14

the -- the words that are used in 314?

15

MR. BOND:

So we think it is narrower

16

in the circumstance for the same reason the

17

Petitioner does, that it includes the

18

possibility that claims will drop out along the

19

way.

20

And, again, "challenged by the

21

petitioner" standing alone is capaciously broad

22

and could encompass any number of things.

23

context that tells you that it's narrower.

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

exactly work the other way around?

It's

But doesn't that
Of course,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

by the end, you're only going to resolve the

2

challenges that -- that remain pending.

3

you're doing the institution decision of inter

4

partes review, you're going to look at the

5

petition.

6

When

Couldn't it be just that simple?
And doesn't 314 kind of cut against

7

the government in some ways too by suggesting

8

that all the PTO needs to do is decide whether

9

there is one claim that isn't frivolous, that's

10

-- that's the sum total of its job under the

11

plain terms.

12

MR. BOND:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

14

So -­
And that -- and that

beyond that, it need not go further.

15

MR. BOND:

So two points.

First, we

16

agree that 314 is focused on the institution

17

phase and, therefore, the focus is on the

18

petition -­

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

20

MR. BOND:

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

22
23
24
25

Right.

-- whereas in 318 -­
It's what -- what's

left.
MR. BOND:

Right, it's what's left of

the proceeding.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So that's why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

there's a difference in language there, you

2

agree?

3

MR. BOND:

Right, exactly.

And we

4

think that that underscores that what's left

5

can include the fact -­

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

But -- but

7

how then do we deal with the fact that in 314,

8

we have all the -- all the PTO has to do is

9

decide whether there is one non-frivolous

10

claim.

It's a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down

11

decision -­

12

MR. BOND:

Because -­

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- that's

14

anticipated there, not a -- not a

15

claim-by-claim examination.

16

MR. BOND:

Well, two points, Your

17

Honor.

18

simply a floor.

19

that the PTO and, on delegated authority the

20

Board, may not institute, unless it finds that

21

at least one of the claims is -- has a

22

reasonable likelihood of being found invalid.

23

First, what Congress included there is
It's phrased as a prohibition

It doesn't say that the Board must

24

therefore institute or must do an up-or-down

25

determination.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

2

MR. BOND:

No.

We think that that leaves

3

room for the Board to say we can't institute if

4

we don't find at least one, but you know what?

5

We're going to conserve our resources, as

6

316(b) tells us in adopting regulations, and

7

focus then on the claims -­

8
9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, help me -­

help me out with 316 then if that's where

10

you're going to go to.

11

do you see the authority for the regulations

12

that the director is proscribed here?

13

MR. BOND:

Where do you -- where

Sure.

They're in two

14

provisions, principally 316(a)(4), which was

15

the same provision as -- at issue in Cuozzo.

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Now, (a)(4), that -­

17

my problem with that, where I get stuck is that

18

(a)(4) concerns establishing a governing inter

19

partes review.

20

yet.

21

institute inter partes review.

And we're not at that stage

We're at the decision whether to

22

MR. BOND:

Sure.

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I would have thought

24

you'd have to look to -- to (a)(2) rather than

25

(a)(4).

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

MR. BOND:

Right, so (a)(2) is the

2

second provision, but we do think that (a)(4)

3

encompasses this because it's establishing and

4

governing inter partes review.

5

determination whether to institute on a

6

particular claim is part of that universe of

7

things that was granted to the Board.

8
9

And the Board's

But certainly also (a)(2) because that
establishes -- or gives the Board authority to

10

establish rules that govern the showing of

11

sufficiency that needs to be made.

12

17(a) of the gray brief.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

This is on

I'd agree with you

14

to cover -- you've given great discussion on

15

the standards for showing sufficient grounds to

16

institute a review.

17

-- you can help me on how that also includes

18

the authority whether to grant review of this

19

or that claim, the weeding out process.

I'm not sure, I guess I'm

20

MR. BOND:

Sure.

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I can see how it

22

might affect the reasonable likelihood inquiry

23

and how the director is going to go about doing

24

that, but I -- I guess it's a little less clear

25

to me how it also grants him authority, or her

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

authority, to decide which claims to proceed

2

with.

3

MR. BOND:

Sure.

Because -- well,

4

what it says is the standards for showing of

5

sufficient grounds.

6

showing sufficient grounds, that's in (a)(2).

And those standards for

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8

MR. BOND:

9

Yeah.

And what the Board's

regulation is doing is preserving the Board's

10

ability to assess sufficiency on a

11

claim-by-claim basis.

12

encompassed within (a)(2).

13

We think that's

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but -- but

14

314(a) seems to proscribe that -- that

15

question, at least with respect to one claim.

16

It speaks to that very issue.

17

MR. BOND:

Well, it sets a floor, just

18

like the outer time limits that Congress

19

required in 316(a)(11), set an outer time

20

limit, but don't preclude the Board from

21

setting a lower time limit on the completion of

22

the final written decision.

23

The same we think is true of 316 -- or

24

314(a).

It said you may not institute unless

25

at least one of these claims, you conclude, is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

worthwhile because it clears that reasonable

2

likelihood threshold.

3

But especially in the context of the

4

scheme that gives the Board complete discretion

5

to deny review entirely, we think it's

6

improbable that Congress would have tied the

7

Board's hands in this one respect.

8
9

Moreover, not just to say you don't
have discretion -­

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Is there some

11

inconsistency with 304 where you're allowed -­

12

the director gets to decide which question

13

specifically the director wants to take up?

14

There seems to be an express grant to the

15

director there to do exactly what you want to

16

do here.

17

And is its absence here suggestive?
MR. BOND:

We don't think so, Your

18

Honor.

I think the scheme of ex parte

19

reexamination is fundamentally different in

20

that it's a party is just suggesting to the

21

Board, or the Board on its own initiative,

22

saying we're going to look at a particular

23

substance -- substantial new question of

24

patentability that has been raised, and we'll

25

look at which particular claims we think are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1
2

implicated by that.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It's not just claims

3

in 304, it's questions.

4

can pick and choose which questions.

5

granted that express authority.

6

And so the director
And is

And normally we -- we think that when

7

it's granted in one place but not clearly

8

granted in the other that that -- that that

9

intends a difference.

10

MR. BOND:

So, at a minimum, that

11

difference doesn't clearly preclude the Board

12

here under 314(d) and its regulatory authority

13

from saying we're going to treat this as a

14

floor, that we are told by Congress we can't do

15

it unless we clear this floor, but we're going

16

to hold patents or IPR petitions to a higher

17

standard and evaluate them claim by claim

18

because that's consistent with the purpose as

19

Congress told us in 316(b) to consider in

20

adopting our regulations.

21

And those purposes boil down to, as

22

the Court underscored in Cuozzo, making sure

23

we're actually improving patent quality and

24

doing so efficiently.

25

Now, the Board's partial institution

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

approach is perfectly consistent with both of

2

those aims.

3

patent claims it determines actually have a

4

reasonable likelihood of being invalidated

5

without wasting time on other claims.

6

It focuses its energies on those

The Petitioner's all-or-nothing

7

approach puts the Board to an untenable choice;

8

either it wastes time on claims it's already

9

determined don't have a reasonable likelihood

10

of being invalidated, at least based on the

11

arguments presented in the petition, or it

12

doesn't use this new tool at all and all of the

13

work of creating inter partes review was for

14

nothing.

15

And so, in either event, we're not

16

getting the benefit or achieving either of the

17

goals that Congress had in mind.

18

And there -­

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there anything in

20

the statute that would prevent the Board, if it

21

is required to render a final decision on all

22

claims initially challenged by the Petitioner,

23

from instituting a streamlined procedure for

24

dealing with the claims that were found at the

25

outset to have no likelihood of success?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

Why does it need to go through a full

2

proceeding with respect to those claims?

Can

3

-- can it not just say in a summary form we

4

found that these have no likelihood of success?

5

And then that could be appealed to the

6

Federal Circuit and the Federal Circuit could

7

decide whether that -- that determination was

8

permissible.

9

MR. BOND:

So a couple of points, Your

10

Honor.

11

Board is not deciding the merits, it is

12

deciding not to decide the merits.

13

saying you haven't for some reason made a

14

sufficient showing to make us convinced that it

15

is worth our time to investigate the merits of

16

your claim.

17

First, at the institution phase, the

It is

They can also deny, however, for

18

additional reasons, irrespective of the merits.

19

They might say, just as all agree they can deny

20

the petition entirely apart from the merits,

21

they might say this patent claim is going to be

22

very time-consuming and is not going to advance

23

the goals of the statute, so we're going to

24

deny review on that ground.

25

So there is not necessarily a ruling

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

on the merits at all, and it's fundamentally

2

different than a district court, say, folding

3

in a 12(b)(6) or summary judgment ruling

4

because it's based on the agency's discretion,

5

not just the merits.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Or couldn't the agency

7

at that point say, you know, the ground on

8

which you charge this patent is invalid is not

9

a ground we can review at this time?

10

MR. BOND:

Right.

Exactly right.

11

They -- they could as well say that you have

12

challenged this on 112 under indefiniteness or

13

under Section 101, and it's a law of nature

14

challenge, and that's not properly presented to

15

us.

16

estopped and we're not going to consider

17

those -- those -­

18

They could say on those grounds or you are

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And then it would

19

seem, I mean, that would be a strange kind of

20

thing to say, well, you can't challenge on that

21

ground, but we're going to issue a decision as

22

to patentability.

23

MR. BOND:

Exactly right.

So you're

24

forced with either the PTO -- the PTAB either

25

deciding we're not going to review this ground

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

and then that gets baked into the final

2

decision and treated as a merits ruling, which

3

can then be appealed to the Federal Circuit and

4

creates circumvention of Cuozzo, or you're

5

forcing the Board to decide the merits,

6

notwithstanding the fact that it didn't

7

institute review, didn't get submissions from

8

the parties at the merits stage, and didn't

9

apply the different standards that apply at the

10

merits stage of IPR proceedings.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It -- it

12

didn't institute review, but it issued a quite

13

lengthy decision on -- addressing the issues,

14

right?

15

MR. BOND:

It issued a lengthy

16

decision, about half as long as the final

17

decision, but they're different in kind.

18

I'd like to emphasize a few ways that they

19

differ.

20

And

So, importantly, when the Board denies

21

review, it often is denying review for some

22

threshold reason based on a failing in the

23

petition presented to it, not deciding

24

patentability at the end.

25

So a good example here is at Petition

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

Appendix page 115a to 116a where the Board

2

denies institution of claims 11 through 16.

3

Those claims are what are known as

4

means-plus-function claims, where under Section

5

1112(f) -- or 112(f) their meaning is

6

determined by a particular structure set forth

7

in the specification, not in the claim itself.

8
9

Accordingly, the Board's regulations
-- and this is 42.104 -- require a petition for

10

inter partes review to identify what structure

11

do you think determines the construction of

12

this claim so that we, the Board, can determine

13

if it's unpatentable?

14

The Board said at 115, the petition

15

didn't identify what structure it was that the

16

Petitioner thought informed the construction or

17

the interpretation of these claims.

18
19
20

So a fortiori, we can't determine
patentability based on your submission.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How often -­

21

how often does it issue decisions -- written

22

decisions at this stage in determining whether

23

to institute inter partes review?

24
25

MR. BOND:

So I -- I don't have

statistics on how frequently it issues

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

decisions of this kind.

2

Board's ordinary practice, and we think for two

3

reasons that is actually a good practice that

4

the Board, in its discretion, has -- has

5

adopted.

6

We think it is the

It's helpful for the Board itself

7

because, if the Board institutes review, it

8

then -- the judges of the panel or whatever

9

panel is assigned to it, then have a very short

10

window set by statute to determine the merits

11

of this proceeding after the administrative

12

trial is complete.

13

And, second, it's beneficial for the

14

parties to this case and other cases to know

15

what it is the Board is looking for in this

16

relatively new statutory scheme when it

17

institutes review and exercises its discretion.

18

That discussion at page 115A of the

19

petition appendix is illustrative.

It shows

20

other parties in the future, if you actually

21

don't follow our rule and include the kind of

22

structure that we say you must, because 112(f)

23

requires us to look at that in construing the

24

claim, we are unlikely to grant review on your

25

petition.

That's instructive to the bar and the
patent bar and to the patent community -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. BOND:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

the very reason given by the Board in

7

encouraging these kinds of opinions to be

8

written.

MR. BOND:

I thought -­

-- to know how -­
-- that that was

That's precisely right,

10

that it's useful to the patent -- it's useful

11

to the patent bar and useful to the community

12

to know -­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the Patent

14

Board basically told the public, we're issuing

15

these decisions for educational purposes?

16

MR. BOND:

That's right, it -- to

17

educate the -- the -- the public and the patent

18

bar and also itself and its panels on what the

19

nature of this suit is or what -- what this

20

dispute is and what it looks for in the future.

efficient method of partial institution, we

24

think that's beside the point of the question

25

presented to you today.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
59
1

Whether the Board could achieve more

2

efficient partial institution with a thumbs up

3

or thumbs down is not a reason for the Board to

4

jettison that system entirely and adopt this

5

much more inefficient approach where it lacks

6

discretion over the one thing that is common to

7

patent law.

8

that claims are evaluated independently.

litigation, each claim is independently

The default rule in patent law is
In

presumed valid under Section 282.
It would be highly incongruous for

12

Congress to say, when the expert agency is

13

reviewing patents it has issued, it lacks

14

discretion to constrain the scope of its review

15

and lacks discretion to do what is ordinarily

16

the rule in patent law.

17

in discretionary review generally, we're not

18

aware of any context in which a tribunal vested

19

with discretionary review authority is put to

20

this choice of reviewing all -­

21

And indeed, the rule

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

What do you say

22

about our -- our last argument, where a lot of

23

our attention focused on Congress's putative

24

intention to -- to want to move things to an

25

expert agency and -- and speed things along,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

make it more efficient?

2

Could -- could that be a reason here

3

why Congress might have wanted the Patent

4

Office to review any -- and -- and issue a

5

final decision on any and all claims brought to

6

it?

7

MR. BOND:

So, two points.

We don't

8

think that it would be more efficient in a

9

sense of making things go faster.

10

If the Board

--

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, I -- no, surely,

12

not necessarily efficient from the -- the PTO's

13

perspective, but efficient from the economy's

14

perspective.

15

MR. BOND:

So -- so then two points on

16

the -- on the economy benefit point.

17

going to benefit the economy first if the PTO

18

is put to a choice between not instituting

19

review at all, that is, no benefit to the

20

economy, or spinning its wheels on claims in a

21

patent on -­

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It's not

But it could do what

23

Justice Kennedy said.

That -- that would -­

24

everybody agrees would remain an available

25

choice.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

MR. BOND:

It could indeed do that,

2

and that, we think, highlights that this is

3

consistent with Congress's goals.

4

achieve -- achieve the same result in two more

5

cumbersome steps -- two more cumbersome steps,

6

it makes sense that Congress did not intend to

7

preclude it from doing so through this natural

8

--

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

If it could

Well, it would

10

require consent by the -- by the litigant in

11

that case, whereas here, this litigant took the

12

view that I really want an adjudication on

13

everything that -- would it be crazy to suppose

14

that Congress might have wanted that as a way

15

to achieve maximum efficiency through this

16

administrative process?

17

MR. BOND:

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19
20

So -­
For the -- from the

economy's perspective?
MR. BOND:

We don't think the consent

21

issue is fundamentally different, because if a

22

petitioner, again, comes in and says, I want

23

IPR on claims 1 through 10, and the Board says,

24

we'll give you IPR on 1 through 5, the

25

petitioner can, in effect, walk away if they

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

can just simply agree with the patent owner to

2

say, look, we drop our IPR challenge, I'll go

3

back to the infringement suit where you sued me

4

and presumably want to litigate, and we'll

5

litigate that there.

6

Section 317.

7

That's permitted under

Now, to be sure, the Board at that

8

point can proceed to adjudicate in its own -­

9

within its own proceeding the underlying

10

claims, but that has nothing to do with the

11

rights or consent of the parties inter se.

12

And I think to the -- the underlying

13

question here is isn't this meant as a

14

substitute for litigation?

15

statute itself makes clear that that's not the

16

design of inter partes review.

17

And we think the

The limited scope -- so it's limited

18

to 102 and 103, it's limited to particular

19

prior art, and it's limited only to particular

20

claims that this petitioner brings to the PTO.

21

It can't be viewed as a substitute for

22

litigation such that someone could reasonably

23

look at the scheme and say Congress wanted all

24

of these claims decided either in one forum or

25

the other.

It's baked into the scheme that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

there will be this potential for some claims to

2

be reviewed by the PTO and others in court.

3

And partial institution actually

4

enhances the efficiency and harmonious working

5

of these two things because the -- the Board

6

can say, look, you've got a solid challenge on

7

claim number 1, we will review that.

8

of them we don't think have met our standard,

9

or we exercise our discretion not to review

The rest

11

court, so the district court litigation can

12

proceed, and we'll deal with this one, and the

13

district court can decide what to do.

14

We're releasing those to the district

Petitioner's position, by contrast,

15

creates, I think, an incentive at least for

16

parties to seek to tie up district court

17

litigation by seeking IPR.

18

And the example we gave in, I think,

19

page 39 and 40 of our brief is where an -- an

20

entity sued for infringement, can then, on a

21

strong patent claim, can take that claim to

22

IPR, add on some weak and vulnerable claims and

23

ask the PTO to grant review.

24
25

If the Board's only choice is to grant
all or nothing and it grants all, then the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

district court is very likely, we think -- at

2

-- at least there's a possibility, that it will

3

stay the district court litigation, and the

4

alleged infringer has effectively slowed down

5

the district court litigation over claims that

6

had nothing to do with that suit.

7

That possibility, we think, is

8

inherent in Petitioner's approach that puts the

9

agency to that kind of choice, whereas -­

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Are you relying at

11

all on the notion that this entire inter partes

12

scheme is to give the agency a chance to take a

13

second look to correct its error; therefore, it

14

should not be the petitioner who controls what

15

the agency will consider?

16

MR. BOND:

Yes, Your Honor.

And I

17

think that that's an important feature of inter

18

partes review, that this notion of master of

19

the complaint just doesn't translate here, one,

20

because Section 311(b) doesn't say you may get

21

review of anything you want, but you may get

22

review only of these kinds of things, but more

23

fundamentally because the point of this scheme

24

is to give the agency an opportunity to

25

reconsider decisions in the form of patent

-- and Congress thought

18

that wasn't sufficient and adopted this

19

additional mechanism.

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21

MR. BOND:

Right, right.

And so Congress, in giving

22

the agency authority and discretion to deny

23

review entirely and so much discretion over the

24

way these proceedings work, we think it's

25

simply improbable that Congress would have

given the agency all the discretion, except

2

over the scope of which claims it will

institute and particularly given that the

MR. CASTANIAS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

I have three specific responses to

points made by my friend and then four broader

17

points that I hope I'll be able to get in in my

19

Justice Kagan, your colloquy with my

Mr. Chief Justice, you had a colloquy

25

with my friend about the lengthy decision that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

was entered at the institution phase here.

And

2

my friend responded to you that this was a

3

failure to follow the rules of the tribunal.

4

This was a merits decision that was

5

made.

It said that we had failed to show the

6

corresponding structure, which is a requirement

7

of the law under Section 112-6.

12

Justice Sotomayor, you asked the

question about what the education purpose is of

the institution decision.

15

education can come from an appealable and

16

estopping decision.

17

Our point is that

Now, the broader points, Justice

subject of inter partes review and" -- that's

"shall" and "any" in the same way that that

still have to address that?

MR. CASTANIAS:

Okay, yes.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

says that partial institution is not

11

permissible?

12

MR. CASTANIAS:

The fact that the

Board has already given the discretion whether

16

second level of discretion to decide to

17

institute anything other than the petition.

The discretion whether to

And it says,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

"The director shall determine whether to

3

And we say that's a binary choice, and

4

we say that's consistent with the if/then
