Mr. Walsh.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN C. WALSH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. WALSH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The relevant transfers in this case

12

are the transfers by and to the financial

13

institutions, Credit Suisse and Citizens Bank.

14

We know that because Congress included

15

intermediaries in the safe harbor from the very

16

beginning, focusing on what they do rather than

17

who they are.

18

We know that because Congress used the

19

disjunctive, "by or to or for the benefit of" a

20

financial institution or another institution,

21

which precludes an approach that looks only at

22

the party that has a beneficial interest in the

23

transaction.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'll read them -­

I'll read them with more care, but the circuits

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

that come out as -- as you would ask us to, it

2

seems to me focus on the word "settlement" and

3

that that controls everything.

4

talk about transfer.

5

transfer in a lay sense, but that's not the

6

transfer here that the trustee seeks to avoid.

7

MR. WALSH:

And they don't

Of course, there was a

Well, Your Honor, the -­

8

there was a lot of discussion of whether or not

9

something is a settlement payment in some of

10

the earlier cases.

11

"securities contract" and "commodities

12

contract" to the statute, and those are much

13

broader concepts.

14

In 2006, Congress added

And so there's -- there's much less

15

discussion about whether something is or is not

16

a settlement payment because frequently it is a

17

transfer in connection with a securities

18

contract.

19

But it is true that the transfer

20

targeted by the plaintiff in this case is the

21

end-to-end transfer between the parties with

22

the beneficial interest.

23

distinct or separable or independent transfer

24

from the transfers that made it up; the

25

transfers that the parties contemplated when

But that is not a

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Walsh, could

3

you explain -- I mean, here we have two

4

parties, Valley View and Merit.

5

claim that either of those is a 546(e) entity,

6

do you?

7
8

MR. WALSH:

And you don't

Neither of those is a

financial institution -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

Yes.

MR. WALSH: -- or one of the other

11

institutions named in the statute.

12

correct.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's

So now the trustee

14

is alleging that Merit got money that otherwise

15

would have been available for distribution to

16

creditors.

17
18

That's the claim.

MR. WALSH:

That's the gist of it,

yes.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So why should it

20

matter whether the transmission was through the

21

banks rather than handed over by Valley View to

22

Merit?

23

MR. WALSH:

Because the goal of the

24

statute is to protect the securities and

25

commodities markets, not just to protect

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

particular players in the markets.

2
3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We know -­

Well, how -- how is

the -- either bank at risk of anything here?

4

MR. WALSH:

Neither bank is at risk of

5

liability in this particular case, but the

6

broader issue is that parties who receive

7

distributions from securities or commodities

8

transactions have a decision to make.

9

safely reinvest in something else?

Can we

Can we make

10

a distribution to our own investors or the

11

benefits of our pension fund or what -- what

12

have you?

13

Or do we have to anticipate that there may be

14

litigation that comes along six, eight -­

15

Or do we have to create a reserve?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, who's

16

insecure about that?

17

to whom the money was ultimately sent?

18
19

MR. WALSH:

The banks or the person

Investors in general would

be insecure about that, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I understood

21

that the safe harbor was not intended to

22

protect people involved in financial

23

transactions.

24

you get into a deal that's contingent on any

25

basis.

That's always a risk whenever

MR. WALSH:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

do that, why bother even creating the

4

fraudulent transfer provisions?

5

contract that any of these people sign in any

6

of these fields is exempt.

7

MR. WALSH:

Well -­
Congress wanted to

Just say any

Well, Your Honor, I agree

8

that anyone engaging in any transaction has

9

some possibility that there could be a claim

10

that would come along later, but Congress has

11

focused here on the securities and commodities

12

markets -­

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Going -- going

back to this transfer question.

15

MR. WALSH:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The

17

fraudulent-transfer provision says the trustee

18

may avoid any transfer or any obligation.

19

it's not talking just about voiding a transfer;

20

it's talking about voiding an obligation.

21
22

Isn't the contractual obligation an
obligation?

23

MR. WALSH:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So

rights obligation?

The contractual -­
Or a contractual

So why can't a trustee

Heritage Reporting Corporation

whether it's a transfer or an obligation?

MR. WALSH:

Your Honor, the -­

5

the scope of who's involved?

6

MR. WALSH:

Sure.

And that define

The reference to

7

obligation in the fraudulent-transfer statutes

8

is -- is generally in reference to a debt

9

incurred by the debtor to someone else.

And if

10

that debt causes the debtor to become insolvent

11

or inadequately capitalized and the other -­

12

the other aspects of the statute are satisfied

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry -­

-- then the -­

17

debtor sold something to someone else or was

18

obligated to send money ultimately to Merit.

19

So how does that not fit into obligation?

20

MR. WALSH:

Well, that obligation has

21

been paid already.

It would -- that -- that

22

application of the statute would normally be in

a situation -­

6

to transfers.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what you called

8

the -- the end-to-end transfer is the transfer

that the trustee is seeking to avoid; isn't

10

that right?

11

MR. WALSH:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

That is correct.

allegedly construction -­

14

MR. WALSH:

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

That's the one that is

That is -­
-- constructively

fraudulent.

17

MR. WALSH:

That is correct.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

So why does -- why

19

shouldn't the exemption provision be applied to

20

the transfer that the trustee is seeking to

21

avoid, if the -- otherwise, is your argument

22

that these intermediate transfers are -- are

23

constructively fraudulent?

24
25

MR. WALSH:

My argument is not that

the intermediate transfers are constructively

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

fraudulent.

My argument is that the

2

intermediate transfers can't be separated from

3

the overall end-to-end transfer, and so that by

4

avoiding the overall transfer, the trustee

5

would necessarily be avoiding the intermediate

6

transfers as well.

7

To think of it a different way -­

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

9

So why shouldn't the

transfer -- why shouldn't the exemption be

10

applied to the transfer that the trustee is

11

seeking to avoid, as opposed to intermediate

12

transfers that can't -- that are not

13

constructively fraudulent?

14

MR. WALSH:

Well, I think a useful way

15

to think about it, Your Honor, is that there's

16

only $55 million involved here.

17

say, as a shorthand, now that we know how the

18

transfer played out -- because it was 10 years

19

ago -- we can say there was a transfer from

20

Valley View to Merit, but it's not different

21

from the transfer of the same $55 million that

22

Valley View sent to Citizens Bank.

23

And we can

And it's not different from the subset

24

of that transfer that Citizens Bank sent to

25

Merit on two different occasions three years

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

apart.

In other words, I understand the

2

trustee's point that I'm only seeking to -- to

3

avoid this broader transfer, but when we have

4

an overriding prohibition like 546(e), I don't

5

think it's sufficient simply to say, but that's

6

not what I'm doing.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, could the

8

trustee, absent 546(e), seek to avoid the

9

transfer from Credit Suisse to Citizens Bank?

10

MR. WALSH:

The trustee, absent the

11

safe harbor, could seek to avoid the transfer

12

from Credit Suisse to Citizens Bank.

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why -- why was there

14

not adequate consideration for that?

15

there -- it was just a pass-through.

16
17

MR. WALSH:

20

I'm -- I'm not agreeing on

--

18
19

There -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What would there be

to avoid?
MR. WALSH:

I'm sorry.

I'm not

21

agreeing on the -- on the merits.

22

suggesting the trustee could pursue that claim.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

24

MR. WALSH:

25

I'm -- I'm

But would you -­

I do think there was

adequate consideration for it, and that claim

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

would fail, but the trustee could seek to

2

pursue it.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your friend on

4

the other side says that your theory would

5

cover the simple use of a check to convey a

6

straightforward purchase and sale if the

7

purchaser pays with a check.

8

MR. WALSH:

9

necessarily.

Is that correct?

Your Honor, not

And the Court doesn't need to go

10

nearly that far to rule in our favor in this

11

case.

12

The safe harbor goes at least as far

13

as what we have here, where we have an

14

intermediary, a financial institution serving

15

as an intermediary in much the same way that a

16

broker or a clearing agency would serve as an

17

intermediary -­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I

19

understand that, but I'm concerned about the

20

scope of the rationale that we would adopt, and

21

you say not necessarily.

22

enough that the purchaser just paid by check?

23

MR. WALSH:

When would it be

Well, I think -- let me

24

address the scope first.

I think the scope of

25

checks or wire transfers is actually quite a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

bit less than -- than my opponent would

2

suggest.

3

The vast majority of transfers in

4

securities and commodities, involving public

5

securities in particular, are going to clear

6

through the -- the indirect holding system.

7

They're going to clear through paper, debits,

8

and credits and not with wire transfers or

9

checks.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm just curious -­

11

look, I have two shares of company X in my -- I

12

have an account somewhere, okay?

13

MR. WALSH:

Yes.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, knowing I'm about

15

to go bankrupt, I take my share, and I tell

16

them go transfer it to my wife.

17

MR. WALSH:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right?

Yes.
Now, you'll say they

19

can't attack that as a fraudulent conveyance.

20

I'm just trying to think, you know, of -­

21

MR. WALSH:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

Well, actually -­
-- the paradigm case

of a fraudulent conveyance.
MR. WALSH:

Well, actually, Your

Honor, that -- that very well might be a case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

that wouldn't fall within the safe harbor.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

MR. WALSH:

4
5

Why not?

Because if you transfer

your stock to your wife -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, no.

I told

6

you it's being held in a -- in a bank, and I

7

tell the bank to do it.

8
9

MR. WALSH:

It's being held in the

indirect system -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. WALSH:

12

to your wife.

Yeah.

-- and you -- you sell it

Then in -- then in that case -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

It does.

14

MR. WALSH: -- there's safe harbor.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

So this covers -­

16

that's, I think, the thrust -- this is going to

17

cover all kinds of things.

18

I have another -- another question,

19

which is -- which is, and this is just a

20

puzzle, look, when they define financial

21

institutions -- what we have here is a

22

transfer, we wanted to have a -- Valley View,

23

VVD, Valley Downs, see, wants to give $55

24

million to a group of people that include the

25

Merit Downs or whatever, Merit?

All right?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

MR. WALSH:

Yes.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.
That's what they want

3

to do.

Neither of them is financial

4

institutions.

5

Downs says its friend, Credit Suisse, which is,

6

you have the line of credit, you send it to the

7

Citizens Bank, which is the escrow.

But the way they do it is Valley

8

MR. WALSH:

Correct.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you say, in real

10

terms, it goes from Valley to Merit, but we do

11

it by means of the guy who gives the line of

12

credit, which is a bank, Credit Suisse, and

13

they send it to the escrow agent, which is

14

Citizens Bank, okay?

15

MR. WALSH:

That's correct.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so the argument

17

here is, because they used these two agents,

18

now, suddenly, does it fall into the securities

19

-- the bank -- or the -- or the bank exception,

20

the Industrial Savings Bank exception, the et

21

cetera, et cetera.

22

MR. WALSH:

Correct, right.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

And -­

So why are we

24

hearing this case?

For this reason -- now,

25

this is slightly a side issue, but it's very

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

puzzling, and I think I should know the answer,

2

when I look up the definition of financial

3

institution, it says that not only is it Credit

4

Suisse and not only is it Citizens Bank, but it

5

is also the customers of each of those

6

financial institutions in an instance where the

7

bank is acting as agent or custodian for a

8

customer.

9

Now, it seems to me that Citizens Bank

10

is acting for agent or custodian of a customer,

11

namely VVD, and it seems to me that Credit

12

Suisse is acting as a -- as an agent or

13

custodian for VVD.

14

So why doesn't that cover it?

15

MR. WALSH:

16
17

I think that is a fair way

to look at it, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, why doesn't

18

that cover it?

Why are we dealing with a case

19

which is coming out of something and deciding

20

all kinds of things about banks and my wife, if

21

I -- you know, where -- where this is

22

absolutely dealt with in a statute, under -­

23

under another provision, and nobody refers us

24

to that provision, and I can't understand why

25

they didn't -- what's going on?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

MR. WALSH:

Your Honor, we did -- we

2

did refer to that provision in -- in both of

3

our briefs, if I remember correctly.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

So -­

You may have put it

5

in your briefs, but, I mean, why in the lower

6

courts wasn't this just said, look, point to

7

that, Judge, this involves a customer of a

8

financial institution, namely VVD, and,

9

therefore, it's in the exempt area?

10

that.

11

didn't happen.

Point to

And -- and I want to know why that

12

MR. WALSH:

That I don't -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's your case.

You

14

can do it in a sense the way you want, but, I

15

mean, where this is just standing out and we're

16

asked to decide a question that I think is

17

fraught with difficulty, I would like to know

18

the answer.

19

MR. WALSH:

I'm afraid I don't have a

20

good answer for why that did not come up

21

earlier.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Perhaps it's simple -­
JUSTICE ALITO:
conceded it.

Oh, I thought you

Didn't both parties -- didn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

both parties concede that -- that Valley View

2

is not a financial institution?

3
4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You just did in

answer to my question.

5

MR. WALSH:

No, I'm sorry.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I said -- I asked

7

you that, with the question that Justice Breyer

8

raised in mind, I asked you specifically, do

9

you agree that neither Valley View nor Merit is

10
11

an entity enumerated under 546(e)?
MR. WALSH:

I may have -- I may have

12

misunderstood the difference between the two

13

questions, Your Honor.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think it's the

15

same, but, I mean, at some point, you know, if

16

we have two cases involving the Fishing Act,

17

and it involves fishermen, and both parties

18

concede we are -- we are fishermen, but, in

19

fact, what they are is both farmers and have

20

nothing to do with fish, I would say we'd have

21

a problem in this Court about whether we should

22

hear the case.

23

MR. WALSH:

And -- and, Justice

24

Ginsburg, in response to your question, neither

25

of the parties to this case is a -- is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

financial institution, as that term is -- is

2

generally understood.

3

In trying to -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

But not as the

statute understands it -­

6

MR. WALSH:

In -- in the -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER: -- which uses it to

8

include a customer of a financial institution

9

in circumstances which are present here.

10

MR. WALSH:

That -- in the rather

11

unusual definition of financial institution,

12

this is a situation in which the banks act as

13

-- acted as agents, that's -- that's an escrow

14

agent.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you -- if this

16

was such a standout issue, you must have

17

thought about it, and yet, you relegated it to

18

a footnote in your reply brief.

19

MR. WALSH:

And I -- and I don't know

20

whether it's a standout issue or not, Your

21

Honor, but that is a quirk in the definition of

22

financial institution, that is true.

23

true.

That is

24

I think one of the -- one of the ways

25

to think about what's going on here is whether

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

Congress is protecting particular institutions

2

or whether Congress is protecting transactions.

3

If Congress wanted to protect banks

4

and brokers and clearing agencies from

5

liability, and that was the only purpose of the

6

statute here, that could have been resolved in

7

Section 550, which is the section of the

8

Bankruptcy Code that deals with who has

9

liability if there is a transfer that's

10

avoided.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that -­

12

actually, 550, I think, works very strongly

13

against you because 550 says the trustee may

14

recover for the benefit of the state the

15

property transferred, so it seems to be talking

16

about who has control and dominion of the

17

property that the trustee is seeking to

11

is, Your Honor, the reason the courts have

applied that definition to the term "initial

receives a transfer is not necessarily the

It's a non-literal

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. WALSH:

Exactly.

And -- but the reference I

19

was making to 550 earlier, Your Honor, is to

20

550(c), which is an example of a situation in

21

which Congress perceived that there's a

22

problem, that a transfer may be avoided and

23

certain parties may be liable.

24

And Congress's response was to say,

25

avoid the transfer all you want, but here is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22

the very limited subset of parties against whom

2

you may recover.

3

That is what the opponent here would

4

like to happen here.

5

is the actual function of 546(e), that it only

6

protects banks and brokers and clearing

7

agencies.

8

which would have accomplished that.

9

That is what they propose

And Congress didn't do it in 550,

There -- there's also the problem here

10

that the statute protects transfers by banks

11

and brokers and clearing agencies and these

12

other parties.

13

protecting the bottom lines of banks and

brokers.

talk in the briefs about the exception

Yes.
Could I take you back

to Justice Alito's question, perhaps just put a

little bit of a different spin on it?

16

if you look at 546(e), it's clearly an

exception to the avoidance power.

"notwithstanding" all these sections which deal

19

with avoidance, the trustee may not avoid the

20

following transfers.

I mean,

It says

So, I mean, it seems odd to read that

22

in any other way than to start with the

23

transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.

24

should we not do that?

25

what the text tell us -- tells us to do, where

Why

Why isn't that exactly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

you start with the transfer that the trustee

2

seeks to avoid and then you ask whether there's

3

a safe harbor that applies to that transfer?

4

MR. WALSH:

I think the -- the first

5

-- my first response, Your Honor, is that when

6

-- when we're dealing with a prohibition of

7

that sort, we don't simply look at what the

8

party says it is doing.

9

So, if I'm called to a visit with a

10

U.S. attorney because I allegedly filled a

11

wetland, it's not a sufficient response for me

12

to say I didn't fill a wetland; I built a

13

parking lot.

14

did I do in the process of building the parking

15

lot?

16

And if I did, I have a problem, notwithstanding

17

that I characterize my actions in a different

18

way.

19

We have to look at, well, what

Did I put a bunch of gravel in a wetland?

But a second response is that because

20

these transfers, the way we characterize the

21

different pieces of this transaction as

22

transfers are integrally -- integrally

23

interrelated, to say that a trustee can avoid

24

the end-to-end transfer without affecting the

25

others, the intermediate transfers, in any way

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1
2

is just inconsistent with reality.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess you're asking

3

a court to make a shift in transfers in the

4

middle of the analysis.

5

the court has to say whether this is the kind

6

of transfer that the trustee can avoid, and in

7

doing that, the court is looking at the -- what

8

you call the end-to-end transfer.

9

In other words, first,

And then all of a sudden, when it

10

comes to the safe harbor, you're saying that

11

the trustee has to flip and look at another

12

transfer entirely.

13

strange thing for a safe harbor to do.

14

And that seems like a

I mean, usually what we think is that,

15

you know, a safe harbor would shield from

16

avoidance a transfer that's being challenged,

17

rather than a transfer that isn't being

18

challenged.

19

MR. WALSH:

I -- I think the

20

difference in -- between what you're saying and

21

what I'm saying, Your Honor, is that it's not a

22

different transfer entirely.

23

talking about, say, the transfer of the real

estate, where the plans were to build the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18
19
20

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I think it would be helpful if I could

21

start with the elephant in the room, which is

22

Justice Breyer's question about the definition

23

of the financial institution and then address

24

the question presented.

25

So, Justice Breyer, a couple of points

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1
2

about that.
First of all, I think it could not be

3

clearer that that's never been at issue in this

4

case, and even more to the point, the

5

Petitioner, when they were trying to get this

6

Court to take the case, emphasized the fact

7

that this wasn't in dispute as a sort of a

8

positive feature of this petition.

9
10
11

So, if you look at page 3 of the
petition, it is clear that the Petitioner -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

I have no doubt that

12

neither party wanted it resolved on that basis.

13

And so what's nagging at the back of my head is

14

that, since it seems so clear, it's like two

15

farmers who decide they have some other

16

financial interest in fishing, and they'd love

17

to have this Court decide the Fishing Act, but,

18

in fact, if you look at the Farming Act, you've

19

got the answer to the dispute between them.

20

And can two parties who would just

21

love it, if we could decide an issue that

22

really isn't at issue before them, and can they

23

stipulate away all of the actual, you know,

24

they stipulate away the basic rule that a

25

contract is valid upon signing or something, in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

order to get us to decide a question?

2

MR. CLEMENT:

So, Justice Breyer, if

3

you really had the farmer/fisher idea -- fisher

4

person idea, I think what you would do is

5

dismiss the case as improvidently granted,

6

which would serve my client's interest just

7

fine.

8

reasons why that issue was not put front and

9

center by my friends here.

10

But I think there are two very good

The first is that it's completely

11

inconsistent with their overall theory of the

12

case.

13

every customer of every one of the six

14

protected entities is protected ipso facto by

15

virtue of the fact that it went through one of

16

those entities.

17

Their overall theory of the case is that

So it's more than a little bit of an

18

embarrassment for them to come across a

19

definition that says that customers of one of

20

the six, in relatively narrow circumstances,

21

are also covered.

22

23

things.

24
25

It's inconsistent with their
They really can't argue both

Here's the -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think, though,

Mr. Clement -- I'm sorry, if you want to -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I was just going

2

to say the second point why they're not making

3

it, which is it doesn't apply here anyways,

4

which is, as I read that provision, it is very

5

narrow, and it protects the customer only when

6

the bank is acting -- when the bank is acting

7

as an agent or custodian.

8
9

It doesn't say when the bank has acted
or in the past acted.

It says when is -- the

10

bank is acting as the custodian or the agent.

11

So if, hypothetically, we had -- the

12

-- the trustee had tried to avoid the transfer

13

while the money was still at Citizens Bank,

14

then maybe, just maybe, we'd still probably

15

want to have a debate and actually look at, you

16

know, and talk about what agent means in this

17

context, but then maybe it applies.

18

And maybe it applies for a reason

19

then, which is, in that context, maybe Citizens

20

Bank is actually inconvenienced by this, but

21

this is why I think that I really disagree with

22

my friend when he says that the transfer the

23

trustee sought to avoid and the underlying

24

transfers are sort of indivisible.

25

Think about what happens if we prevail

the wire transfer fee.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it's not

20

that simple.

I mean, this is not simply -- I

21

think you try to portray it, it's simply a

22

matter of conduits that -- that don't have

23

anything to do with it, but as I understand it,

24

the intermediaries had a lot to do -- this -­

25

this -- they were there functioning as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37

intermediaries -- intermediaries for several

2

years.

3

to check.

They had certain compliance obligations

4

There were going to be payments in

5

this event, but no payments in that event.

6

They were seriously involved.

8

the money.

9

MR. CLEMENT:

They weren't

You're right, Mr. Chief

10

Justice, to a degree, but for whatever the sort

11

of exertion they did, they were compensated.

12

And the trustee's not trying to get that

13

compensation back.

14

I mean, if you can imagine this case,

15

when the wire transfer went from Credit Suisse,

the money went to Citizens and then eventually

17

to Merit.

Now, if the trustee here thought, you

know, this whole thing is such a bunch of

baloney, that we should get the money back from

23

$1,000 to Credit Suisse, so I have a theory, as

It then cross-references five sections

7

of the statute, each one of which uses the term

trustee may avoid.

It describes a transfer that the
It just seems like these

provisions -- there are all these textual

interrelationships between the two provisions,

12

such that it seems perfectly natural to say

the transfer that the trustee is seeking to

15

avoid.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could -- what

17

if the trustee -- would there be situations in

18

which it would make sense for the trustee to

19

want to avoid one of the intermediary transfers

20

rather than simply the ultimate one?

21

MR. CLEMENT:

It might, but they

22

probably run into 546(e), I mean, which is to

23

say you can imagine a situation where you

24

really thought that, you know, the money

25

stopped at one of those banks, and so the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39

the ultimate transferee, the right person to

bring the action against was the bank.

3

Or if the bank's trading on its own

4

account or something, I think, in that

5

situation, and you know, you -- you'd have a

6

transfer where the transfer that the trustee

7

was bringing under 544, 545, all those various

8

provisions, the transfer you're seeking to

9

avoid was a transfer to a bank.

Right, no -- look, in

that situation, an aggressive trustee might

19

seek to avoid a transfer to the bank, but in

20

that situation, 546(e) stops that in its

21

tracks.

22

And I think it's also important to

23

remember that 546(e) is added at a point where

24

you already have limitations as to which

25

transferee you can recover from.

hypothetical, it would actually be tough to

5

figure out whether or not the financial

6

intermediary really was just a conduit, in

7

which case they'd be protected under

8

preexisting law, or whether they sort of ended

9

up with the money when the music stopped.

10

And what Congress tried to do in

11

546(e) was to provide a nice bright-line rule

12

that protects these intermediaries, and it

13

seems like it is consistent with both the

14

general interest and the bright-line nature of

15

the rule to say this is relatively

16

straightforward, let's look at the transfer the

17

trustee is seeking to avoid.

18

seeking to avoid a transfer that is by, to, or

19

for the benefit of one of these six entities,

20

that's it, motion to dismiss -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If the trustee is

Well, does that

22

mean -- does that mean, Mr. Clement, that we -­

23

all we do is we look at the trustee's

24

complaint, we leave it to him to decide the

25

question?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
41
1

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes, Justice Kagan, but

2

I think the reason that that doesn't create

3

some sort of mischief here is that, in making

4

that -- the complaint, the affirmative part of

5

the complaint, the trustee isn't just sort of

6

free to pick transfers at random that he or she

7

seeks to invalidate.

8
9
10

They have to come up with a transfer
that fits the terms and the requirements of one
of those provisions of the code in Chapter 5.

11
12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So that -- that might

be right.

13

I was trying to think of cases in

14

which there could be mischief by relying

15

entirely on the trustee's power to define the

16

transfer.

17

And here is what I came up with, is

18

that there truly is a transfer from a debtor to

19

a bank, if the bank's not serving as an

20

intermediary, it is a real transfer of stock,

21

right?

22

And now, 546 -- 546(e) is going to

23

prevent the trustee from avoiding that.

But

24

then the trustee says:

25

around 546(e), I'm going to define the transfer

So, in order to get

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42
1

differently, I'm going to ask where the bank

2

then transferred the stock and -- and -- and

3

say that the transfer that I want to avoid is

4

from the original debtor to whoever it was that

5

the bank transferred the stock to, even though

6

those really were two separate transactions.

7
8
9

Could the trustee play games like
that?
MR. CLEMENT:

I don't think they -- I

10

mean, they could try, but I don't think they

11

would get away with it.

12

know, in any case where the trustee brings an

13

action against somebody, they're going to have

14

essentially two kinds of defenses to raise.

15

And I think that, you

One is going to be an affirmative

16

defense based on 546(e).

17

your hypothetical the trustee's kind of pled

18

around that, but you still have to -- the

19

trustee still has to essentially satisfy the

20

terms of the original avoidance provision, and

21

I don't think, for purposes of that

22

hypothetical, though it might depend on some

23

details of it, that the trustee would be able

24

to do that.

25

Now, it may be in

And then, of course, there's a second

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

piece of this, which is to make this in a -- in

2

a transfer situation, to really get any juice

3

for the effort, you have to not only avoid the

4

transfer, but you also have to get recovery

5

under 550.

6

And in the hypothetical that you're

7

talking about, the third-party subsequent

8

transferee would not be the immediate -- the

9

initial transferee under 550.

And so, as long

10

as they took it in good faith and paid value

11

for it, they'd be completely protected.

12

So I just don't think it would work.

13

And I think it is important to recognize that,

14

you know, this is not a situation where the

15

trustee can just sort of, you know, pick the -­

16

well, today, I feel like the Credit Suisse to

17

Citizens Bank transfer is the one I'm going

18

after.

19

That would satisfy -­

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if we're -- if

21

we're writing the -- the opinion to accept your

22

proposition, how do we -- how do we qualify it?

23

Do we -- do we say that this does not apply to

24

transfers where the settlement institution does

25

not have an equity participation?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

I mean, what -- what -­

2

MR. CLEMENT:

See, I wouldn't do that,

3

Justice Kennedy.

4

way some of the courts had -- have written it,

5

but I think the simpler way to write the

6

opinion is to say, to apply 546(e), just look

7

to the transfer that the trustee seeks to

8

avoid, and it's as simple as that.

9
10

I think that's -- that is the

If the transfer that the trustee seeks
to avoid -­

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But that -- that -­

12

that then involves Justice Kagan's concern that

13

you're giving the -- the trustee a chance -- a

14

chance to define the transfer in a particular

15

way.

16

defines a transfer so it's abundantly clear the

17

-- what transfer is -- is involved, then that's

18

one thing.

19

Now, if the -- if the Bankruptcy Code

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, but I tried to be

20

responsive to Justice Kagan's question, and I

21

think that the code puts all sorts of limits on

22

the trustee when they're picking the transfer

23

that they're seeking to avoid.

24
25

So, for example, for certain
provisions of the code, you can only avoid a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

transfer at a certain time period if it's a

2

transfer to an insider.

3

to buttress the idea that that provision of the

4

code doesn't really care much about the

5

intermediaries because otherwise you could say,

6

well, there's never a transfer to an insider

7

because it always goes through a bank first.

8
9

Now, that seems to me

So I think the trustee is disciplined
not just by 546(e) but by the various things

10

that the trustee has to show to qualify the

11

particular transfer for being avoidable under

12

one of the affirmative avoidance powers.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What do you think is

14

wrong, Mr. Clement, with the alternative

15

approach?

16

approach, which Justice Kennedy was referring

17

to, it's more of a functional analysis; you ask

18

who has dominion and control of a particular

19

piece of property at a particular point.

20

-- and that seems more what the Seventh Circuit

21

was doing than -- than what your brief

22

suggests.

23

If I understand the alternative

And

So why do you think that that's a

24

worse alternative than the one you're

25

suggesting?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan, let

2

me start by saying it's a lot better

3

alternative than my client losing this case.

4

So, if you find that attractive, I mean, that's

5

fine.

6

Here's the reason, though, that,

7

honestly, I don't think it's right.

Because I

8

think one point my -- my friend and I agree on

9

is that when Congress was passing the

10

predecessor to 546(e) back in the day, there

11

was already substantial protection for the

12

intermediaries under the recovery provision,

13

550, if they were truly conduits and weren't

14

the beneficial owners.

15

And so I think what Congress was

16

trying to do with 546(e) was to provide an

17

alternative, more bright-line way for the

18

financial intermediaries to get out of the case

19

early at the motion to dismiss stage.

20

And the problem with this looking for

21

the beneficial ownership is it's really the

22

same inquiry, and it could be fact-specific in

23

a particular case, that Congress was trying to

24

supplement with this bright-line rule.

25

And we think our rule gives a nice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

bright-line rule that courts can apply at the

2

motion to dismiss stage, literally just look at

3

the complaint, look at the transfer the

4

trustee's seeking to avoid, and then, if it

5

satisfies 546(e), you know, you're done,

6

trustee loses.

7

If it doesn't, we move forward.

Of course, when you move forward, you

8

can still get into this beneficial interest

9

inquiry.

10

That's part of the 550 inquiry

because here -- ­

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

Well, how -­

-- as in almost every

case -- sorry.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How do you -- how

15

do you answer what your colleague stressed;

16

that is, it doesn't say for the -- only for the

17

benefit of a financial institution.

18

"by."

19

enough.

20

It says

If a transfer is by a financial, that's

MR. CLEMENT:

You're right, Justice

21

Ginsburg, and we think that's right, but we

22

think what Congress was addressing in that

23

situation was the precise situation that the

24

Southern District of New York dealt with in a

25

case called Seligson, which I think both

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

parties agree is the case that Congress was

2

trying to address with the predecessor to

3

546(e).

4

And that was a situation where the

5

financial intermediary -- there I believe it

6

was a commodity broker -- is the bankrupt.

7

so -­

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. CLEMENT:

And

So for this -­

And so, in that

10

situation, you do want to protect and shield

11

the transfers by the bankrupt because the one

12

thing Congress was clearly concerned with is

13

you'd have a bankruptcy by one of the hub

14

players in the financial industry and that

15

would create this sort of ripple effect to

16

everybody who dealt with them.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, for this

18

provision, do I have this right?

19

the -- the transaction that the trustee is

20

trying to set aside as a preference or

21

fraudulent conveyance.

22

Who is the person who directed that that

23

transfer be made?

24
25

A, look to

B, ask the question:

All right.

If it's a financial institution, et
cetera, stop right there, good-bye, you're out.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

If not, continue to question 3.

And question 3

2

is:

3

conduit of that transfer?

4

a financial institution, you're out.

5

otherwise we go on to ask the other questions.

Who is the initial transferee and not a

6

And if the answer is
And

And that means that a -- that the

7

transferee, the initial transferee, if he's

8

receiving money that he is to hold for the

9

benefit of the other, he still is the initial

10

transferee.

And you will look to such matters

11

as to who this money is to benefit later on in

12

your -- your efforts.

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Is that right?
Well, Justice Breyer, I

14

think you've aptly captured the Seventh

15

Circuit's reasoning.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

18

to make this case even simpler.

I'm actually asking you

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Uh-huh.

I'm asking you to look

21

at the transfer that the trustee seeks to

22

avoid.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. CLEMENT:

25

Yeah.

That has to be by

somebody and to somebody -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah.

-- in order for it to

3

satisfy 544, 545, 547, or the two provisions of

4

548 that 546(e) cross-references.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. CLEMENT:

All Right.

So there you have, right

7

on the face of the complaint, a transfer by

8

someone, to someone, or for the benefit of

9

someone, because as we explained in the brief

10

--

11
12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you have what it

says?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

-- the reason that

14

language is there is because the avoidance

15

power is not limited to transfers to somebody

16

who is like an insider or a creditor -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

MR. CLEMENT:

That's right.

-- but also to somebody

19

who is for the benefit of a creditor or an

20

insider.

21

complaint, apply 546(e) to the transfer that

22

the trustee has put at issue, and if the terms

23

are satisfied, then the trustee loses.

24
25

So just look at the face of the

And if the terms are not satisfied,
then you move forward and you probably analyze

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

all of those transferee questions before the

2

case is all over, but I do think it's more

3

faithful to what Congress was trying to

4

accomplish when it enacted the predecessor to

5

546(e) to have a nice, bright-line protection

6

that's there for the financial intermediaries.

7

It doesn't protect all of their

8

customers.

It doesn't protect Merit.

They

9

have other arguments they can eventually make,

10

but what they wanted was a nice bright-line

11

rule so clearing agencies, commodity brokers,

12

and then eventually stockbrokers and financial

13

institutions and financial participants would

14

all have a nice, clean motion to dismiss

15

argument to win their case.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

May I address a

question that confused me in your briefing?

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You kept saying

20

that the initial transfer had to be by the

21

debtor.

22

But the code permits the trustee to

23

void a non-debtor's transfer if the property

24

that that non-debtor is transferring is of an

25

interest of the debtor in property.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

So it's not so clean to say that the

2

transfer has to be by the debtor.

3

be by the debtor's agent, a non-debtor.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

It can also

Justice Sotomayor, I

5

think you're right that it's certainly not

6

clean.

7

we're actually right, and I get some solace

8

from the fact that our position is supported by

9

Professor Brubaker, who's spent a lot more time

10

Now, I think, at the end of the day,

looking at the code than I have.

11

So I think we're actually right that

12

even when it's a transfer by a third-party of

13

an interest of the debtor, it actually ends up,

14

for purposes of the code, being a transfer

15

"made by," which I think is the relevant term,

16

"made by" the debtor.

17
18
19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So that's how

you're reading that then.
MR. CLEMENT:

That's how we're reading

20

it, but I want to make as clear as I can that

21

nothing turns on that.

22

it makes -- if you -- if you accept that, it

23

makes our position that much clearer.

24
25

Our position -- I think

But nothing turns on it.

And I think

what that just helps to show is that, either in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

100 percent of the cases or the vast majority

2

of the cases, that when you get to transfer by,

3

either for purposes of the avoidance power or

4

for purposes of the exception of 546(e), it's

5

going to be a transfer by the bankrupt.

6

whether it's 99 or 100 percent, nothing

7

ultimately turns on it.

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

So why -- but why

then did you argue that the transfer from

10

Credit Suisse to Citizens Bank -- both involved

11

property of the debtor, why did you argue that

12

that wouldn't qualify because it wasn't a

13

transfer by the debtor?

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Because the way we read

15

Chapter 5 of the code is it essentially ignores

16

conduits for purposes of identifying who's the

17

transferor and who's the transferee.

18

think that's consistent throughout Chapter 5.

19

That's why for its -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And we do

You don't think

21

Credit Suisse or -- or Citizens Bank fell under

22

the safe harbor automatically?

23

financial -­

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

They're both

I think -- I think if

the trustee had tried to avoid that transfer,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1
2

it would automatically satisfy 546(e).
What I'm making, though, is the point

3

that I don't think, properly understood, that

4

is even a transfer by Credit Suisse.

5

think maybe the way to try to at least

6

understand the point I'm making, but nothing

7

turns on it -­

8
9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I

Oh, okay.

That's

what I'm -­
MR. CLEMENT:

-- is -- is think about

11

the charitable giving exception.

Now, it

12

allows -- it exempts certain transfers by the

13

debtor to a qualifying charitable institution.

14

Now, I would think the vast majority

15

of those are made by telling your bank I want

16

to give $2,000 to this charity.

17

accept their view that you subdivide

18

everything, well, then that's not a transfer by

19

the debtor to the charity.

20

the debtor to Credit Suisse, which is not a

21

charity, and then a transfer by Credit Suisse

22

to the charity.

23

Now, if you

It's a transfer by

And that doesn't come within the

24

exception to the power, which is nonsense.

25

That's clearly not what Congress was trying -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -- but, Mr.

2

Clement, on that, I assume your friend will get

3

up and say, well, a lot of those charitable

4

contributions are by check, and those aren't

5

covered.

6

And just as -- just as we heard when I

7

asked the question about avoidable transfers,

8

that it became an empirical debate about how

9

many of those would be covered.

10

So how -- how clean a line is this

11

really?

I mean, what -- what you're

12

suggesting?

13

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, two things,

14

Justice Gorsuch.

First of all, my friend would

15

want to tell you that the checks aren't

16

covered.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

18

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah.

But, with all due

19

respect, I don't think he has a theory as to

20

why.

21

critical.

22

in that statute that allows you to draw that

23

distinction, as the colloquy with Justice

24

Breyer showed, there might be a theory based on

25

the definition of financial institution -­

And I think that's -- that's what's
I mean, you know, if there's no word

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

2

MR. CLEMENT:

Customer.

-- why the escrow

3

situation is different from the check

4

situation.

5

But if he's right, and all you have to

6

do is have a -- any kind of transfer and we

7

don't ignore any transfers by or to a financial

8

institution, I don't think he's offered you a

9

theory for why checks don't count.

10
11

So that

would be the first point.
The second point would be, yeah,

12

there's some empirical debates here we don't

13

know the answers to.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

MR. CLEMENT:

Right.

But if we're looking for

16

a clean answer, I mean, I think both sides are

17

giving you a clean answer.

18

giving you an answer that says, if it's a

19

settlement payment or a margin payment or a

20

payment in connection with a securities

21

contract, unless there's like the one person

22

out there that's doing these things with bags

23

of cash, it's covered.

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

MR. CLEMENT:

They're basically

Yeah.

We're giving you the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

clean position that -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The amici -- the

amici give us a very clean position, right,

4

that we need a transferee under the statute and

5

a debtor under the statute.

7

Maybe I misread it.

8

I read the red

Did you endorse the amici's clean
position without qualification?

MR. CLEMENT:

We think we get to the

16

exact same place.

17

coming at this more like a lawyer instead of a

18

bankruptcy professor, I think about it in

19

really simple terms, and it maps on to the

20

procedural history of this case.

I think, maybe since I'm

The trustee here brought a complaint.

defense was based on 546(e).

The -- Merit filed an answer
The affirmative

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

It just seems logical, as -- as

2

Justice Kagan suggested, albeit in a question,

3

so she might not have meant it, but -­

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. CLEMENT:

-- but as Justice Kagan

6

suggested, like what world do you look at

7

different transfers for purposes of the

8

exception to the affirmative defense than the

9

transfer that you're looking at for the prima

10

facie case of avoidance in the first instance?

11
12

It seems like the statutes work
together very well, hand in glove.

13

And we haven't talked a lot about the

14

policy implications of their clean position,

15

which is that, sort of, as long as there is a

16

bank anywhere involved in a securities

17

transaction, it's exempted.

18

And the consequences of that are, I

19

mean, really quite simple and quite striking,

20

which is, in a case like this, where otherwise

21

the unsecured creditors are going to get 15

22

cents on the dollar, which is already enough to

23

ruin your whole day -­

24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
right.

All right.

But the Second Circuit is very

Heritage Reporting Corporation

All

concerned about the effect that this would have

2

on the leveraged buyout industry and -- and,

3

therefore, the economy more broadly.

4

I can understand an argument that

5

Congress in 1978 wasn't much concerned about

6

the leveraged buyout industry because it didn't

7

exist, as we now know it, but what -- what else

8

do you say in response to that, the parade of

9

horribles that we've heard?

12

horribles, Your Honor, but let me try to be as

13

responsive as I can, which is to say, I think

14

if Congress were really concerned about the

15

leveraged buyout situation, it would have

16

written a very different exemption than the one

17

that it wrote here.

18

something like leveraged buyout.

19

exempted certain smaller ones or larger ones.

20

It might have defined
It might have

You know, when you have this provision

21

applied in the context of a very large

22

transaction on the public markets, there are

23

lots of the trustees' prima facie case,

24

including that there wasn't sufficient value

25

provided and the like, those are going to be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

relatively difficult to prove, I mean, at least

2

if you believe in sort of the efficiencies of

3

markets.

4

But when you have leveraged buyouts

5

for small companies, I mean, that is a fertile

6

ground for essentially getting money out of the

7

company and away from unsecured creditors and

8

to some favored party.

9

So as -- as the trustee's amicus brief

10

said, to sort of carve out, you know, leveraged

11

buyouts from the fraudulent avoidance laws,

12

that's carving out a lot because these are

13

transactions where there is a risk that's quite

14

considerable to mulcting the interest of the

15

unsecured creditors.

16

The last thing I'll say before I sit

17

down is just, in addition to all the other

18

textual arguments we make in the brief, I do

19

think it's worth emphasizing that, under their

20

view of the statute, Congress's effort in 2005

21

to add financial participants as the sixth on

22

the list of protected entities was completely

23

superfluous and just a fool's errand, because I

24

can't imagine that financial participants who

25

are defined as entities with $100 million or a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

billion dollars in transactions were doing

2

those transactions with cash.

3

So those financial participants were

4

already customers of these five entities, so if

5

that's enough to bring you into the statute,

6

Congress was utterly wasting its time in 2005.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I ask,

8

Mr. Clement, you might have no insight on this

9

and you might not be able to say anything about

10

it, so if so, just say so, but it is curious to

11

me, I've never seen a bankruptcy case, maybe

12

ever, but certainly a bankruptcy case like this

13

one, in which we do not have a Solicitor

14

General brief.

15
16

Do you have any thoughts about why the
SG didn't file here?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

No, I don't have any

18

particular thoughts, other than I do think

19

that, if what we were urging on you was really

20

a catastrophe for the markets or something

21

else, boy, I sure think the SG would be here,

22

wave -- you know, waving at least a yellow

23

flag.

24
25

To me, the amici that aren't here that
speak even louder, though, are, frankly, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

lack of financial institutions, stockbroker,

2

clearing agency amici.

3

I mean, look, normally, I don't think

4

you really draw any inference through -- from

5

the amici that aren't here, but, you know, if

6

you told me that, wow, there's this provision

7

that's in the code that's specifically designed

8

to protect your interests, and the Seventh

9

Circuit adopted a narrow construction of it,

10

and it's going up to the Supreme Court of the

11

United States, and they will decide the scope

12

of this exemption that protects your industry,

13

I mean, if -- if you had any thought that you

14

were not fully protected by the Respondent's

15

view as much as the Petitioner's view, I would

16

think it would be worth your while to file an

17

amicus brief.

18

And the fact that they're not here, I

19

think, underscores that the entities that

20

Congress was trying to protect are fully

21

protected by our view, and they're fully

22

protected by the Petitioner's view.

23

so is the rest of the world.

It's just

24

And I just don't think there's any

25

view that Congress actually intended to not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

just protect those six financial entities, but

2

to protect everybody else who essentially

3

transacted in them, in connection with the

4

securities contract.

5
6

So we think the decision below should
be affirmed.

7

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN C. WALSH

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MR. WALSH:

14

I'd like to return to Justice Kagan's

15

question a little bit earlier about whether we

16

can focus solely on the transfer as the trustee

17

identifies and characterizes it.

18

Thank you.

And I think it's useful to think about

19

what happens if that end-to-end transfer in

20

this case is avoided and -- and some amount of

21

that would have to be refunded by Merit.

22

think the question we have to ask is then:

23

what of the transfers from Citizens Bank out of

24

escrow to Merit?

25

I
So

Can we say that those transfers are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

still valid and in effect and have been

2

consummated and have been paid, and Citizens

3

has satisfied its obligations because Merit has

4

the 16 and a half million dollars?

5

And I think the answer to all those

6

questions is no because, once the broader

7

transfer is avoided and a recovery is made,

8

everything else falls with it as well.

9

So when we say the -­

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sorry.

I thought

11

that 550 said that post -- that transferees

12

from Bedford could be protected by other safe

13

havens, if they paid consideration in -- in

14

good faith, et cetera, they would be okay?

15

MR. WALSH:

No, that -- that's right.

16

If -- if -- well, Bedford didn't receive the

17

transfer, Your Honor, the shareholders of

18

Bedford, including my client, received the

19

transfer.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. WALSH:

22

If they had transferred it

on -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

MR. WALSH:

25

Right.

Right.

And that's what we were

talking about, the good faith defense would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
65

2

come into play.
But what I'm talking about is the

3

transfers from Citizens out of escrow to the

4

shareholders.

5

transfer is avoided and recovery is had against

6

Merit, then those transfers into and out of

7

escrow involving financial institutions are not

8

in full force and effect.

9

If the -- if the broader

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. WALSH:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what?

So -­
I mean, if I write a

12

check, and it goes to the postman, and the

13

postman delivers it to Smith, and I get my

14

money back from Smith, then I guess you could

15

say, well, the postman -- that putting it in

16

the mailbox didn't have any financial effect.

17

So what?

18

MR. WALSH:

So the -- the so what,

19

Your Honor, is that, when the trustee says, I'm

20

only seeking to avoid the one transfer and the

21

rest can -­

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that is all

that he's trying to avoid.
MR. WALSH:

-- and the rest can be

disregarded -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, I know, but I

2

mean it has no effect.

If FedEx, you know,

3

delivered the check.

4

ways of delivering the check.

5

a conduit, the bank, it's quite true in a sense

6

that transfer from the bank didn't have any

7

effect because the people who got the money had

8

to give it back to the people who deposited the

9

money.

I mean, there are many
If they're just

10

But my question was, so what?

11

MR. WALSH:

The so what is that the

12

statute says the trustee may not avoid the

13

transfer by a financial institution.

14

-- by avoiding the transfer, the broader

15

transfer -­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so by

And there's no -­

17

there's no consequence to Citizens Bank, is

18

there?

19

MR. WALSH:

20

bottom line, that's correct.

21
22

It would not hit Citizens'

JUSTICE BREYER:

No -- no -- no

consequence?

23

MR. WALSH:

That's correct.

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

MR. WALSH:

Okay.

I -- I do want to talk

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
67
1

about consequences, though, because this is a

2

case involving 16 and a half million dollars.

3

As the Court is aware, both sides in the

4

Tribune case have filed amicus briefs.

5

case is, let's call it 100 times larger than

6

ours, it's more than that.

7

That

And the issue there, and Justice

8

Gorsuch mentioned the Second Circuit's opinion,

9

which is justifiably concerned about what

10

happens, there are thousands of defendants in

11

that case.

12

Of course, if Goldman Sachs or Merrill

13

Lynch received a distribution in that case for

14

its own account, they don't have liability,

15

that transfer can't be avoided.

16

everybody would agree about that.

17

are employees who held company stock, there are

18

pension funds that held stock in Tribune.

19

these other entities remain exposed.

20

I think
But there

All

Over the past 30 years, Congress has

21

expanded and expanded and expanded the safe

22

harbor to bolt on different concepts, including

23

financial institutions.

24

courts, with a few exceptions, have been

25

interpreting the statute broadly.

At the same time, the

important.

6

It didn't do that.

And one -- one last point, Mr. Clement

7

mentioned the Seligson case.

8

was -- I'm sorry.

9
10

And it's

And what Congress

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You can finish

your point.

11

MR. WALSH:

The -- the notion that

12

transfers by an institution are protected by

13

the safe harbor covers a good bit more than

14

transfers by an institution into the clearing

15

system.

16

The example I gave before where

17

Goldman Sachs transferred me a bunch of

18

Berkshire Hathaway stock for a nominal amount

19

of money is covered as well, so it's broader

20

than Seligson.
