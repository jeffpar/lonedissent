Rosales-Mireles versus the United States.

Ms. Davidson.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTIN L. DAVIDSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. DAVIDSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The government concedes that the Fifth

12

Circuit's shocks-the-conscience standard is the

13

wrong approach for a court of appeals to apply

14

under the fourth prong of plain error review.

15

The question remains:

16

appeals exercise its discretion when confronted

17

with an obvious guidelines error that probably

18

results in a defendant serving a longer prison

19

sentence?

20

How should a court of

We ask the Court to recognize what

21

every circuit but the Fifth already has; that

22

is, in the ordinary case, such an error

23

seriously affects the fairness, integrity, and

24

public reputation of the judicial proceedings

25

and warrants correction.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One -- one

2

day?

I mean, if your -- if the person is in

3

prison one extra day, that people -- will cause

4

people to look at judicial proceedings as

5

lacking fairness and integrity?

6

MS. DAVIDSON:

I believe so under the

7

-- under the analysis of the fourth prong.

8

Certainly, a sentence of an extra 20 years,

9

versus a day, 20 years is worse, but, under the

10

analysis of the fourth prong, the question

11

really is, does the nature of the error

12

frustrate the purposes served by the rule at

13

issue?

14

And in the context of the guidelines,

15

a guidelines error directly frustrates the very

16

purposes served by the sentencing guidelines

17

scheme:

18

uniformity and proportionality and to avoid

19

unwarranted disparity; to achieve parsimony,

20

meaning that a defendant is sentenced to the

21

least amount of time necessary to effectuate

22

the statutory goals; and to have respect for

23

the district court -­

24
25

the congressional goals to promote

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, and these

are all reasons that you would consider when

Heritage Reporting Corporation

the question is -- when there's an objection

2

and the question is raised.

3

dealing with a situation was -- when there was

4

no objection, so we're in the context of plain

5

error.

6

argue more than just:

7

ought to be fixed.

Here, we're

So it seems to me that you have to

MS. DAVIDSON:

This was wrong and it

Agreed.

This Court has

always said something more is required, but at

10

-- at this point, a defendant has met his

11

burden to show a plain error that affects

12

substantial rights.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We have said many

14

times that correction under the plain error

15

doctrine should be exercised sparingly, but I

16

take it your argument is, in the context of a

17

guidelines error, the discretion should not be

18

exercised sparingly; it should be exercised

19

routinely.

20

MS. DAVIDSON:

Well, Your Honor, I

21

think the context is that 52(b) applies to the

22

grand universe of errors.

23

errors remain a narrow type of error that can

24

arise.

25

fiscal year, of the thousands of sentencing

And so guideline

And statistically speaking, in the last

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

appeals that were raised, less than 6 percent

2

got remanded because they raise a guideline

3

calculation error.

4

So we have the empirical evidence,

5

which is cited on page 12 of the yellow reply

6

brief, that, in fact, it doesn't happen very

7

often.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why are guideline

error -­

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But then you are

11

saying -- you are saying that guidelines errors

12

are -- are exceptions to the general rule that

13

plain error review should yield corrections

14

sparingly?

15

category where it should be exercised

16

routinely?

17

You are saying that this is a

MS. DAVIDSON:

I think a guideline

18

error presents a -- the nature of the guideline

19

error is such that it ordinarily will have that

20

effect, but it won't always.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and why is

22

that?

Why are guideline errors a category in

23

which we should kind of flip what usually

24

happens; it goes from sparingly to most of the

25

time?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

MS. DAVIDSON:

As the Court has

2

recognized in Peugh and Molina-Martinez, the

3

sentencing guidelines provide the essential

4

framework for federal sentencing, and there is

5

a well-documented anchoring effect so that when

6

there is an erroneously high guidelines range,

7

there's a significant risk that the defendant

8

was sentenced to a longer prison time than he

9

otherwise would have had the district court not

10
11

been influenced by the error itself.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

That seems more a

12

prong 3 question, isn't it?

13

you know, that -- that most guideline

14

calculation errors are going to have an effect

15

on the -- on -- on -- on the sentence, but then

16

there's also prong 4.

17

something different?

18

MS. DAVIDSON:

The question -­

Why shouldn't that do

It's our position that

19

prong 3 and prong 4 do have distinct inquiries,

20

but because there's such a direct nexus between

21

the sentencing guideline error and the effect,

22

the separate inquiries will also -- will often

23

be examining the same or similar type of

24

information on the record before it.

25

And while it is true that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
8
1

Molina-Martinez looks at the anchoring effect

2

of the guideline to show that the guideline

3

error itself can be evidence of an effect on

4

substantial rights, the resulting harm of that

5

is a longer prison sentence.

6

amount of prison is a serious harm that run -­

7

that has consequences both for society and the

8

administration of justice.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

And an excess

I mean, if we said

10

that an error is plain if it creates a risk

11

that the defendant will serve a longer sentence

12

than the defendant would have otherwise served,

13

I don't know what's left of the plain error

14

rule in criminal cases.

15

You -- you seem to be equating -- you

16

seem to -- your argument seems to be that an

17

error is plain unless it's harmless -- unless

18

it is not harmless, isn't that right?

19

MS. DAVIDSON:

No.

And there's

20

actually quite a lot left of the plain error

21

analysis.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what is left of

23

it in this context?

I mean, you cite three

24

examples in your brief.

25

defendant has waived an objection to the

One is when the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

guideline -- to the sentence in -- in a plea

2

agreement.

3

already completed the sentence, in which case I

4

think the case would be -- would be moot.

5

There would be no opportunity to get relief in

6

a direct appeal.

7

the defendant is serving a concurrently running

8

sentence.

9
10

The other is when the defendant has

And the other is when the -­

Do you have others?
MS. DAVIDSON:

Yes.

We -- we cite the

11

Tyson case on page 8 in the yellow brief, and

12

that's a -- a good example of where we have two

13

different inquiries that are informed by the

14

same sort of information, the effect of the

15

guideline.

16

In that case, the court of appeals

17

assumed that the third prong was met but denied

18

relief under the fourth prong because it found

19

that the ultimate purposes of sentence were not

20

frustrated by the guideline error because the

21

guideline error didn't serve the basis for the

22

sentence in the first place.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So, if there's

24

any chance that the guideline error affected

25

the sentence, then the error is plain?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

That's

Official
10
1
2

your argument?
MS. DAVIDSON:

Well, yes, it would

3

rise to a level of seriousness to warrant

4

correction.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Now, if we were

6

to apply that in other contexts, what would be

7

left of the plain error rule in criminal cases?

8
9

MS. DAVIDSON:
different.

Well, every error is

And a factor for a court of appeals

10

to consider under the fourth prong is the

11

nature of the error.

12

And I think that can be broken down

13

into two factors:

14

at what purposes are served by the rule in

15

question, and then to examine the record to see

16

if it demonstrates that those purposes are

17

actually frustrated by the error.

18

First, for the court to look

So I think that's a type of inquiry

19

that's at least implicit in Cotton and Johnson.

20

In cases like that, errors like that would

21

certainly -­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Error -­

23

evidence is erroneously admitted at trial.

24

It's hear -- it's hearsay and it's -- it's

25

inadmissible hearsay.

It's admitted.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

Official
11
1

there's an error.

But the reviewing court says

2

that the -- the harmless error standard for

3

non-constitutional errors is met.

4

a chance that it had an effect on this -- on

5

conviction.

But there is

6

So why wouldn't that be a plain error?

7

MS. DAVIDSON:

Well, it likely could

8

be a plain -- I mean, no, it -- it -- the -­

9

let me back up.

10

The evidentiary standard that has to

11

be met under the third prong of the plain error

12

is a -- is a low evidentiary standards:

13

reasonable probability.

14

preponderance of the evidence.

A

That's less than

15

So it's entirely possible that a court

16

could look at the record and see that the third

17

prong was met but then, looking at the record

18

in total, find overwhelming and essentially

19

uncontroverted evidence that the outcome was

20

right, notwithstanding the error.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

But you're changing

22

the standard.

23

error standard when you say that, aren't you?

24
25

You're changing the harmless

MS. DAVIDSON:

Harmless -- excuse me.

Are we talking about harmless error standard or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1
2

the plain error standard?
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, my inquiry is

3

what is the difference between the plain error

4

rule and the harmless error rule as you

5

understand them?

6

what I think you just told me was that the

7

court would have to say it's uncontroverted,

8

that this had no effect, otherwise it would be

9

plain error?

10

And you just told me, as I -­

MS. DAVIDSON:

If I understand the

11

question correctly as distinguishing between

12

harmless error and plain error, the -- the -­

13

one of the primary differences is that the

14

burden remains on the defendant the entire time

15

during the plain error analysis.

16

The burden never shifts like it does

17

under a harmless error standard.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19
20
21
22

Yeah, well, that ought

to cut in the opposite direction, shouldn't it?
MS. DAVIDSON:

I'm not sure I

understand the question.
JUSTICE ALITO:

The defendant has the

23

burden under plain error, right, so it should

24

be harder there.

25

don't understand what is left of the plain

I -- I still don't -- I just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13

error rule.

2

left, if the only question is, is there any

3

chance that it caused the defendant to serve a

4

longer sentence than the defendant would have

5

otherwise served?

6

There doesn't seem to be very much

MS. DAVIDSON:

I think the approach

7

that's applied by the majority of circuits

8

actually gives vitality to the plain error

9

standard, as the Court expressed it in Olano.

10

And it turns on the seriousness of the error.

11
12

So it's going to be contextualized by
the error and its effect on -­

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought you had

14

just said that the guidelines miscalculation is

15

an exception to the normal way that plain error

16

operates.

17

in guidelines miscalculations, the error should

18

be corrected routinely, not sparingly.

19

thought you were cordoning off guidelines

20

miscalculations from all other errors.

You -- you have agreed with me that

No.

I

21

MS. DAVIDSON:

Let me clarify.

22

The majority approach that circuits

23

apply don't change the formula that is in place

24

under the plain error standard.

25

remains that the defendant prove all four

It still

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

prongs.

2

What is different about a guidelines

3

error is the nature of that error.

4

particularly close nexus between the error and

5

the outcome and how that outcome frustrates the

6

purposes served by the sentencing guidelines

7

scheme.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

There's a

Well, then your

answer to Justice Ginsburg should be yes, and

10

it should have been yes at the outset.

11

said sentencing is different.

12

You

We have separate rules for sentencing,

13

in part because the costs of remand are much

14

less than the cost of a new trial, there can be

15

some complexities, and it seems to me that you

16

have to confront the consequences of that

17

choice to say that, in the sentencing case, an

18

ordinary error is very close to plain error.

19

But you seem to resist -- resist that.

20

MS. DAVIDSON:

No, I -- let me

21

clarify.

22

formulation, Justice Kennedy.

23

I think that's the correct

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if that's the

24

correct formulation, then why?

Why is a

25

sentencing guidelines error more serious than

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

any other type of error, more serious than a

2

constitutional error, more serious than a

3

violation of a statutory command?

4

Here, we're not even talking about

5

something that's mandatory.

6

exist in some kind of a middle universe that I

7

-- I don't understand, but that's another -­

8

that's another question.

9

These guidelines

Why -- why -- why is this different?

10

MS. DAVIDSON:

Well, the analysis

11

doesn't turn on whether or not it's a

12

constitutional or non-constitutional error or

13

that the sentencing guidelines are mandatory

14

versus advisory.

15

It's looking at how close of a nexus

16

exists between the error and how it affects the

17

outcome.

18

are the starting point for every sentence and

19

are in the real basis the -- what a sentence

20

becomes anchored to, we have empirical data

21

which reflects their anchoring effect, that

22

when there's an erroneously high guideline

23

range, there's a serious risk that -- a

24

significant risk that the defendant's sentence

25

was also higher than it would have been had the

And because the sentencing guidelines

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16

district court not been improperly influenced

2

by it.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I think

4

the basis for your -- or perhaps a basis for

5

your exception is that the error is so precise,

6

you know, a typographical error has caused the

7

person to stay in jail for -- to have to stay

8

in jail for another six months.

9

typographical error and exactly six months.

10

A

So I think one of the considerations

11

we take into account is the reputation for the

12

judicial system, justice system.

13

tell somebody, well, because of a typo, the guy

14

is going to stay in jail for six more months,

15

people will say, well, that's not -- that's not

16

fair.

17

And if you

On the other hand, I don't think that

18

takes into account there is cost associated

19

with that, which is the -- the remedy is you

20

send it back for another sentencing hearing,

21

who knows how long, how much time has passed.

22

The judge has to reconstruct the whole

23

operation.

24

failure to object when he should have objected.

25

And that's caused by your client's

So why doesn't it make sense to say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

that it kind of makes a difference, if you're

2

talking about a relatively insignificant amount

3

of time -- any day in jail is not

4

insignificant -- but there's a difference

5

between an error that results in an additional

6

six months and an error that results in an

7

additional five years.

8
9

Is that something that the court can
consider, or is it -- I guess it's the first

10

question I asked.

11

it's plain error?

12

Is your position one day and

MS. DAVIDSON:

I don't think the

13

amount of excess is the -- is the right marker

14

for a court of appeals to determine because it

15

would run contrary to the congressional goal of

16

parsimony.

17

And as the Court stated in Williams,

18

it's the district court's prerogative to

19

determine the appropriateness of a particular

20

sentence to begin with.

21

As to relative cost, certainly,

22

there's always some cost involved to

23

resentencing, but the fact is it is a lower

24

cost than having a new trial, for example.

25

The Court recognized that resentencing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

doesn't present the same amount of costs in

2

Molina-Martinez.

3

And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mrs. Davidson -­

4

Ms. Davidson, I think of the three prongs, the

5

third and the fourth prong, the third prong as

6

being fairness of process:

7

process that you were entitled to

8

constitutionally or statutorily?

9

Were you given the

And so, on the third prong, we've had

10

many cases where elements were not given to a

11

jury.

12

where a drug amount wasn't given to a jury.

13

look at that third prong as a substantial

14

deprivation of some form of constitutional or

15

state right.

16

This is neither case.

We've had Cotton,
We

I think of the fourth prong as

17

fairness of the ultimate outcome, which is very

18

different because often, like in Cotton, where

19

an element like drug amount wasn't given to a

20

jury, we look at the quantum of evidence and

21

say:

22

And that's most of our cases.

23

error so substantial that the outcome was

24

actually unfair?

25

Would the outcome have been different?
Was the area -­

And so, for me, that fourth prong does

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

serve even in sentencing guidelines a different

2

function.

3

is that the fairness of a judge's process of

4

considering your sentence from a correct

5

guideline was frustrated.

6

prong goes to, is there a substantial

7

possibility that the outcome was affected, that

8

you would have received a lesser sentence?

9
10

It talks -- our third-prong finding

The third -- fourth

Is there an error in the way I'm
looking at this?

11

MS. DAVIDSON:

No, I don't believe so.

12

And in Cotton, it's not just what the court

13

examined of what the outcome would have been

14

but -- but based on what that record

15

demonstrated.

16

And I think that analysis would apply

17

in this case because we don't have a record

18

that demonstrates what a district court would

19

have done by overwhelming and uncontroverted

20

evidence, especially when it's not just a

21

mathematical error of the guideline, but it's

22

premised on a factual error in the criminal

23

history.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, I think your

-- your point in your brief was he got, at the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

low end of the guidelines, 78 months, despite

2

all of the negative factors that the government

3

points to in its brief, his serious criminal

4

history, et cetera, et cetera.

5

The judge still sentenced him at the

6

low end of the guideline.

And so that

7

demonstrates that it is possible, not just

8

substantially possible, but that the judge will

9

in fairness and upholding the integrity of the

10

judiciary give him a lesser sentence, correct?

11

MS. DAVIDSON:

Yes.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

possibility -- a strong possibility?

14

MS. DAVIDSON:

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

It's a

Yes.
Ms. Davidson, I was

16

wondering about our -- our standard in Olano

17

and the fourth prong, talking about fairness,

18

reputation, integrity of judicial proceedings,

19

and where it came from.

20

And I traced it back to Atkinson, a

21

1936 opinion.

I know you've cited that.

22

wanted your thoughts about that, because in

23

Atkinson, it said district courts should be

24

guided by the following test in when to

25

exercise their discretion to correct a plain

Heritage Reporting Corporation

error and suggested that they should correct a

reputation of judicial proceedings.

5
6

And Olano turned that "or" into an
"and."

7

What do we make of that?
MS. DAVIDSON:

Well, I'm aware of that

8

history, but I also can't ignore how often

9

cited the Court has restated Olano's

10

formulation, so I don't have a position in -­

11

in going back to a pure disjunctive, but I

12

would like to point out that in articulating

13

that -- what became the fourth-prong standard

14

in Atkinson, Atkinson cites Brasfield, and in

15

Brasfield, it's an example where the Court

16

recognized a type of error that, by virtue of

17

inquiring into the numerical division among the

18

jurors, that inquiry itself impugned the

19

system.

20

And so I think there is recognition

21

that -- that different errors have a different

22

degree of seriousness and have a different

23

level of effect compared to -­

24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if that's true

on the fourth prong, public reputation, let's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

say, how are we supposed to determine that

2

normatively, right?

3

We're supposed to take a poll?

4

took a poll, we'd find that a lot of people may

5

not care about how long your client spends in

6

prison.

7

months or not.

8
9

Right?

Or as an empirical matter.
I think if we

Whether it's an extra six

Should that matter?

Should public

reputation in a -- in a -- in an institution

10

that's designed to check majoritarian impulses

11

like the judiciary's supposed to, should -­

12

should those majoritarian influences even

13

matter in our consideration of the fourth

14

prong?

15

MS. DAVIDSON:

Well, I think it's

16

difficult -- difficult because there's not

17

going to be that type of evidence on a record

18

of what the public thinks.

19

formulation of the fourth prong, public

20

reputation of the judicial proceedings, is -­

21

is less of an -- it's not public reputation of

22

the defendant.

23

proceedings.

But I think the

It's of the judicial

24

And so I do think that -­

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So it's a normative

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23

inquiry rather than an empirical one, I think

2

is what you're suggesting, in which case,

3

should -- should the fact that a person spends

4

a day in prison longer than the law permits be

5

something we should care about?

6

MS. DAVIDSON:

Yes, especially when it

7

results from an obvious and easily correctable

8

error.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MS. DAVIDSON:

If there are no further questions, I'd

like to reserve my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN ELLIS

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19
20
21

MR. ELLIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The plain error rule is designed to

22

capture a narrow set of errors that we as a

23

society are not willing to subject to the

24

ordinary rules of party presentation and

25

forfeiture that govern federal proceedings.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

The question here is whether clear

2

guidelines errors -- errors as a class will

3

almost always meet that test.

4

answer is no, and the Petitioner's argument to

5

the contrary ignores fundamental aspects of the

6

federal sentencing regime is inconsistent with

7

the federal rules and this Court's precedent.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We think the

Isn't it so that

most circuits, if not all, that have addressed

10

the question do take the position that

11

guidelines miscalculations, if they're clear,

12

call for correction on plain error review?

13

MR. ELLIS:

So I think Petitioner

14

overstates the consensus in the lower courts.

15

Only two courts of appeals have adopted -­

16
17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did the Ten -- did

the Tenth Circuit?

18

MR. ELLIS:

I'm sorry?

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Did the Tenth

20

Circuit in, what is it, Sabillon-Umana

21

overstate it when the Tenth Circuit said that

22

the third and fourth prongs of the plain error

23

test align in these guidelines miscalculations?

24
25

MR. ELLIS:

So I think -- I think what

the Tenth Circuit said is that courts of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

appeals often exercise authority -- their

2

authority under the fourth prong when the first

3

three are met and that some have adopted a

4

presumption.

5

That's correct.

Two courts of appeals have adopted

6

presumptions, but even those courts have

7

recognized that that presumption may be

8

rebutted in case -- based on the factors that

9

we've identified in our brief as grounds not to

10

exercise the -- the court of appeals'

11

authority.

12

And, in fact, the Third Circuit, one

13

of those two circuits, since Molina-Martinez,

14

has announced -- has made clear that the fourth

15

prong should be applied on a case-specific

16

basis and that it -- even in a case where the

17

first three prongs are met, even in a

18

guidelines case where the first three prongs

19

are met, it imposes a considerable barrier to

20

relief.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Ellis, can -- can

22

I just -- Justice Gorsuch, when he was a judge,

23

wrote this opinion which I'm sure you've read

24

many times, and I just want to quote one

25

sentence from it and then ask you what you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

think about it because he basically, you know,

2

suggests why you maybe lose.

3

(Laughter.)

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

said.

6

who knows, but -­

He might not agree with this anymore,

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

But this is what he

-- he says, "what

reasonable citizen wouldn't bear a rightly

10

diminished view of the judicial process and its

11

integrity if courts refused to correct obvious

12

errors of their own devise that threaten to

13

require individuals to linger longer in federal

14

prison than the law demands?

15

the cost of correction is so small?"

16

Especially when

And I take that to be combining three

17

things.

18

liberty.

19

says, of your own devise; in other words, the

20

court has something to do with it.

21

probation officer has messed up, and then the

22

court hasn't caught the error.

23

third, that the cost of correction is small,

24

certainly relatively smaller.

25

First, you have a deprivation of
Second, you have a -- an error, as he

The -- the

And -- and,

And you package those three things

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

together and you get a -- you know, a rule that

2

treats these kinds of errors differently, that

3

does mean that they're routinely, as opposed to

4

sparingly, corrected.

5

MR. ELLIS:

Sure.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

MR. ELLIS:

Why isn't that right?

So there's a lot packed

8

into that.

So I -- I think just sort of

9

starting with sort of the man on the street and

10

what -- what -- the view of the judiciary, I

11

think if you went on to explain that -- that

12

ours is a system of party presentation that's

13

been designed so that the -- the parties have

14

an opportunity to raise errors and they are -­

15

they're expected to do so, that any complicated

16

system like a system of justice has to have

17

rules and those rules have to have meaning.

18

But I think it's -- I don't know that they

19

would conclude or look less upon the judiciary

20

if -- in a -- in an ordinary -­

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

Well, I think what

they're -­

24
25

Isn't it -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm sorry.

please.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

No,

Official
28
1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

probably do it better than I can.

4
5

I -- I mean, he can

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You're doing a much

better job than I.

6

(Laughter.)

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think what this is

8

saying is, yes, the reasonable citizen,

9

assuming this great reasonable citizen exists,

10

you know, would think all of those things, but

11

he would say here's this particular kind of

12

error, and -- and it's rare that all of these

13

three things come together.

14

Deprivation of liberties, that's

15

pretty common.

But low costs, that's not so

16

common.

17

court's own making, that's really uncommon.

18

And you put all those three things

And the fact that the error is of the

19

together, there's just one result that's

20

screaming out at you.

21

MR. ELLIS:

So -- so you're -- you're

22

exactly right that the deprivation of liberty

23

is not so uncommon.

24

of criminal procedure.

25

rule comes into play, deprivation of liberty is

I mean, this is the rule
So anytime that this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

at stake.

2

costs.

3

So then we're talking about the

And we think the cost might come in,

4

in two different ways.

5

setting the standard as for when you might

6

apply plain error, but we think the Court did

7

that in Olano, that it was correct.

8
9

One way might be in

That standard was ratified in the 2002
amendments to the Federal Rules, indeed where

10

it conformed to Olano, and that this Court

11

has -- doesn't have the authority to change

12

that standard outside of the Rules Enabling Act

13

and the procedures identified there.

14

And then you move on to whether the

15

court -- was one of the court's own making, and

16

I just don't think that's quite right.

17

probation office is, of course, a part of the

18

court, but the responsibility for raising

19

errors, it still lies with the defendant.

20

The

And the defendant has ample

21

opportunity in most cases and, indeed, in this

22

case, to review the PSR and bring to the

23

court's attention any errors.

24
25

And the error in this case was one,
and in many cases will be one, in which the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
30
1

defendant is uniquely competent to identify and

2

bring to the court's attention.

3
4

So you put all that together and you
-- I don't think it follows.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would it -- would

6

it -- would it be ineffective assistance of

7

counsel for counsel not to notice a glaring

8

error in calculating the guidelines?

9

MR. ELLIS:

I think it's -- there are

10

some -- there may be some cases, perhaps.

11

don't think that there's been any claim in this

12

case.

13

obvious error in the -- in the PSR would amount

14

to deficient performance or -- or necessarily

15

amount to prejudice under this -- under

16

Strickland.

17

We

We don't think every failure to spot an

And we think this case is about the

18

category of errors that don't amount to -- to

19

ineffective assistance of counsel and what the

20

court -- a court of appeals should do when

21

they're raised for the first time on appeal.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I still am not sure,

23

when I -- when I leave here and write -- write

24

down what your position is, what is your

25

definition of the fourth prong as it applies to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
31
1
2

this case?
MR. ELLIS:

Sure.

So our definition

3

is -- is what the -- is the Court's definition.

4

Unfortunately, this is a -- not an area much

5

like sentencing itself that lends itself to

6

bright-line rules.

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What is your -- what

8

is your best guidance as to how to apply it in

9

this case using neutral principles?

10

MR. ELLIS:

So I -­

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

MR. ELLIS:

General principles.

Yeah, sure.

So I think

13

the test is the one from Olano, whether the

14

error is one that seriously affects the

15

fairness and integrity -­

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

MR. ELLIS:

18
19

Yes.

-- of the judicial

proceedings.
I think the nature of the guideline -­

20

of the error here should inform that analysis.

21

The Petitioner has argued that we deny that

22

it's relevant, but that's not true.

23

We don't think it's grounds to create

24

an exception to the rule.

And we don't think

25

it's grounds to -- to change that standard, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
32
1

we do think it's highly relevant to how it

2

would apply.

3
4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So what -- I'm -­

I'm waiting to write something down.

5

MR. ELLIS:

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. ELLIS:

Sure.

We think that in -- in a

8

guidelines case, in the ordinary guidelines

9

case, where -- where the sentence that was

10

imposed is one that is lawful and one that is

11

-- that would be reasonable even if the guide

12

-- error had been brought to the attention of

13

the court and -- and corrected, it's going to

14

be an unlikely case, an unusual case, where

15

that is the type of error that seriously

16

affects the fairness, integrity, and public

17

reputation of judicial proceedings.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But there may

20

be -- there may be a case where it does, right?

21

I mean, we're talking about whatever the length

22

of time is here.

23

But let's say the guideline says you

24

should get somewhere between 2 and 5 and, in

25

fact -- between 8 and 10, and, in fact, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
33
1

right guideline was 2 and 5.

2

Would that be a situation where you

3

say the balance worked out so that it would be

4

plain error?

5

MR. ELLIS:

I think it's hard to give

6

a concrete answer based on, you know, facts

7

like that.

8

often -- more often will be met in cases where

9

the sentence doesn't fall within the correct

We do think that it is a much more

10

range.

11

that the magnitude of the error is -- is

12

relevant to the analysis.

13

And we do think, as you noted before,

We also think that what's relevant is

14

that the court could have, even if you couldn't

15

say would have, departed from the -- the range

16

that it's calculated up to the range that was

17

the correct one.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So is

19

that -- is that -- because I have -- I'm -- I'm

20

-- I'm drawing on what the Chief Justice said

21

now and before, in my mind.

22

in my mind is, should we proceed by category?

23

And the question

And people have been focusing, which I

24

agree with, about the -- what Justice Kagan

25

said in drawing on what was written by Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34
1

Gorsuch, what people would think of this, but

2

I'm not thinking of what people would think of

3

this.

4

about.

5

I'm thinking of what the guidelines are

And we have, one, there was an error.

6

Two, it's clear and obvious.

7

affect the party's rights.

He went to jail at

8

least one day more.

So we got those

9

three things.

10

Okay?

Three, it did

And given those three things, it's

11

probably an arithmetical error, probably, but

12

not definitely.

13

error affect -- now there are three things here

14

-- fairness, and the second one is what I focus

15

on, I'm not focusing on fairness, I'm not

16

focusing on public reputation of judicial

17

proceedings, I am focusing on the integrity of

18

the judicial proceeding.

And then we ask, four, did the

19

And the reason I'm focusing on it is

20

because the guidelines have a special purpose

21

and they have a special procedure.

22

purpose is to create a kind of uniformity among

23

people who do the same thing in respect to

24

their punishment.

25

The special

And the special procedure is that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

Commission and the courts cooperate in

2

gathering statistical information so that the

3

Commission can see how that's working.

4

Now, as soon as you have people who

5

depart for incorrect reasons from what they're

6

supposed to put, you muck up that statistical

7

information.

8

And although you could say with just

9

one or two it doesn't matter, there is no way

10

to distinguish between one or two and 51 or 52,

11

and maybe one across the country but maybe one

12

in a single district does matter.

13

And so all those kinds of technical

14

mistakes that do affect the party, that are

15

clear, do interfere significantly with the

16

congressionally legislated purpose of the

17

guidelines and the effort to implement them.

18

Therefore, considered as a class,

19

because of the difficulty of distinguishing

20

among them, we don't want to go case by case,

21

distinguishing as a class, where 1, 2, and 3

22

are met, so is 4.

23

presumption to that effect.

24
25

All right.
it.

To the least, there is a

That's how I would look at

And what's the answer to that?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

MR. ELLIS:

So a couple responses to

2

that, Justice Breyer.

3

this Court recognized that the sort of

4

disparity that Congress is -- was worried about

5

in the guidelines context is not the sort of

6

disparity that's caused by the ordinary rules

7

of appellate procedure.

8
9

Number 1, in Pepper,

And so we don't think there's any
indication here that the kind of disparity that

10

the Congress was -- was concerned about is the

11

type that -- that flows from the ordinary

12

application of the plain error rule.

13

As for the nature of the -- of the

14

guidelines and how they work, we actually think

15

that cuts the other way.

16

it's relevant.

17

sentencing case is that, unlike in a trial, the

18

outcome isn't binary.

19

As I say, we do think

But the difference in a

So, when you're talking about an error

20

that meets the first three prongs, you're not

21

talking about an error that makes -- creates a

22

reasonable probability of a -- of a different

23

outcome in the trial, that is, a conviction or

24

acquittal.

25

creates a reasonable probability of some

You're talking about an error that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
37
1

movement in the sentence.

2

But a defendant in the federal system

3

isn't entitled in most cases to one particular

4

sentence after a duly -- duly being -- been

5

duly convicted.

6

one of a range of lawful sentences.

7

Rather, they're entitled to

And the sentencing commission has

8

established a framework in which there is, for

9

any given defendant with a given criminal

10

history and a given offense conduct, there is

11

actually a range of reasonable sentences within

12

that lawful one.

13

And so, when you're talking about an

14

error that may have created reasonable

15

probability of moving within that range, but

16

the sentence that was imposed still falls

17

within the right range.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Correct.

But if you

19

will read, as I hope you would someday, the

20

introduction to the initial version of the

21

guidelines, which happens still to be there,

22

you will see that the purpose of the Commission

23

is first to create a set of guidelines and

24

then, through the procedures I'm talking about,

25

to see what judges actually do in administering

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
38
1

the guidelines so that those can be improved

2

and changed over time.

3

Now, if we are looking at not what the

4

judge did under the guideline but what the

5

judge thinks he did under the guideline, but he

6

got the guideline all wrong, then, all right,

7

we can't do it, we can't carry that out.

8

MR. ELLIS:

So -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

As I say, we might be

10

able to live with one mistake in one district,

11

but then we have to distinguish which ones, and

12

there's no way to do that.

13
14

So you might end up with 50 -- the
same point I'm making before.

15

MR. ELLIS:

Sure.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I'm saying what

17

the integrity is that is interfered with is the

18

integrity of the congressionally-mandated

19

purpose and method through which the guidelines

20

are to be implemented.

21

MR. ELLIS:

So I don't think there's a

22

record for -- to -- to conclude that the -­

23

that the ordinary application of the plain

24

error rule is going to so muck up the system as

25

you say.

And if there were, I think that would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
39
1

be maybe perhaps grounds for there -- for

2

someone to consider a change to the standard.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Mr. Ellis, if

4

-- if -- along those lines, though, Congress

5

did speak to this question, the feedback loop

6

problem that Justice Breyer has been alluding

7

to, in 3742(f)(1), where it said if there's an

8

error in calculating the sentencing guideline,

9

the case shall be remanded.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yeah, that's true.
Not -- not "may."

12

take it you'd have us read "shall" to mean

13

"may."

14

MR. ELLIS:

So I think that -- that

15

provision, 3742(f)(1), was written to -- to

16

deal with preserved errors in a mandatory

17

system.

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -- well, you

19

haven't -- you haven't suggested that the

20

statute's ineffectual, have you?

21

MR. ELLIS:

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23
24
25

I'm -- I'm sorry?
You'd have us just

ignore the statute then?
MR. ELLIS:

So I think there's

actually a debate.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
your choices, right?

3

MR. ELLIS:

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

MR. ELLIS:

I -- I guess,

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. ELLIS:

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

12

MR. ELLIS:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

Have you got a third

option?

10

14

We either ignore the

respectfully, I -­

8
9

But now -­

statute or we read "shall" to mean "may."

6
7

I think those are

-- I -- I think there is.
Okay.

Number one, I think in -­
So what's the third

option?
MR. ELLIS:

So the third option is to

16

read that to discuss -- to -- to refer to

17

preserved errors and to incorporate the

18

established rules.

19

in Williams, that that -- that that "may" still

20

is subject to the harmless error rule.

21

no reason why it wouldn't be subject to the

22

plain error rule.

23

That's what the Court said

JUSTICE ALITO:

We see

Well, that "shall" is

24

part of the mandatory regime.

I thought that

25

was declared unconstitutional in Booker.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
41
1

MR. ELLIS:

So that's the first option

2

that he gave me, and I think that's still open

3

to the Court.

4

this Court specifically flagged that the

5

discussion there is not meant to settle the

6

question as to whether 3742(f)(1) -­

7

In -- in Footnote 7 of Greenlaw,

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, suppose a

8

district judge said, all right, you know,

9

there's a dispute about which -- what the

10

guidelines range is, and one of the guidelines

11

that's possible here has a range that includes

12

the sentence of 60 months, and I have

13

considered the statutory factors that I am

14

supposed to consider in identifying a just and

15

appropriate sentence and I think 60 months hits

16

it right on the -- the head, and that's the

17

sentence that I'm going to impose and I would

18

impose that sentence no matter what the

19

guidelines said.

20

Would there be a problem there?

21

MR. ELLIS:

There would not.

That

22

would not -- I think that would not meet the

23

third prong of plain error.

24

so far off from what happened here.

25

I think we've talked about the factors in our

I'd say that's not
So the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42

brief.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

But that would be -­

3

if -- if "shall" is taken literally, there

4

would still -- that -- that would still be

5

subject to reversal, wouldn't it?

6

MR. ELLIS:

I think that's right.

I

7

think the Court dealt with that in Williams

8

when it said that the -- the "shall" still is

9

subject to the harmless error rule, and I think

10

in that case it certainly would be harmless.

11

It may be worth going through why we

12

think this particular error is not one that

13

seriously affects the fairness and integrity.

14

So we've numbered out -- laid out a number of

15

factors in our brief from pages 36 to 39, but

16

we think maybe three are the most important

17

here.

18

And the first is that -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Before you -- before

19

we leave that, I'd just like to nail this down

20

--

21

MR. ELLIS:

Sure.

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- because the

23

harmless error rule makes sense to me in

24

Williams in light -- in light of the language,

25

yet because the court has to determine that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

sentence was imposed as a result of an

2

incorrect application of the sentencing

3

guideline, and if it's harmless, it wasn't

4

imposed as a result of.

5

But how do you -- how -- how do you

6

get plain error in -- into this rule?

7

you get, you know, that problem solved?

8

MR. ELLIS:

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

How do

Sure.
Without turning

10

"shall" into "may" or ignoring the statute all

11

together?

12

MR. ELLIS:

So, I think you -- you -­

13

you get it by -- by recognizing that that

14

provision was passed in the backdrop of plain

15

error, that it was talking about preserved

16

errors, and that there's no reason to think

17

that the Congress meant to overturn it there.

18

And you get it by saying that -- by recognizing

19

that that provision was enacted as part of the

20

mandatory guideline system, that what it was

21

doing was implementing 3742(e), which this

22

Court said was unconstitutional in Booker and

23

therefore struck it.

24
25

And so I think there's a decent -- a
very good argument that, in fact, with it goes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

the -- the subsequent provision that says when

2

you violate a provision, an unconstitutional

3

provision in 3742(e), here's what you do.

4

And so, in this case, as I say, there

5

are three principal reasons why we think this

6

-- the error does not seriously affect the

7

fairness, integrity, or public reputation of

8

judicial proceedings.

9

Number 1, the sentence that was

10

imposed fell within the corrected range.

11

know from that, that in the Sentencing

12

Commission's expert judgment, this is a

13

reasonable sentence for a defendant with

14

Petitioner's criminal history and offense

15

conduct, for a typical defendant in that

16

position.

17

So we

Number 2, the district court imposed a

18

sentence within the range it thought was

19

appropriate.

20

infer, that the district court concluded that

21

the Petitioner was, in fact, a fairly typical

22

defendant with this criminal history and

23

offense conduct.

24
25

And so we know from that, or can

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wait just a second.

Just in case you know this, I mean, I should

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I probably should too.

tried to save as much as we could, and I don't

7

know why we wouldn't have saved this one.

8
9
10

Did we declare this -- this

MR. ELLIS:

I mean, we

No, the Court didn't.

There was a -- there was a dispute about
whether (f) would go down with (e).

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

MR. ELLIS:

Yeah.

It was subsequently -­

13

Justice Scalia subsequently wrote about it in a

14

concurrence in Rita, and then the Court wrote

15

about it in Footnote 7 of the majority opinion

16

in Greenlaw.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

My goodness, that's

18

very good.

19

and so we kept it or we didn't?

20
21
22
23

That's very good.

MR. ELLIS:

And so what -­

It's an open question, I

think.
JUSTICE BREYER:
question, okay.

It's an open

Thank you.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. ELLIS:

We don't think it needs to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

be resolved in this case because we do think

2

it's talking about preserved errors and the

3

plain error rule would apply.

4

Number 3 -- the number 3 reason is the

5

district court imposed not just a sentence

6

pegged to the bottom or top of what it thought

7

was the correct range but somewhere in the

8

middle, albeit in the bottom half.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, pretty -- pretty

10

low, you know, just over the bottom.

11

think it -- it seems to me all these, 1, 2, and

12

3, run smack into Molina-Martinez, which, you

13

know, basically rejected all of these arguments

14

and said it doesn't matter if your sentence

15

ends up in the middle because the -- the range

16

does something.

17

determinations, and it anchors them

18

sufficiently so that even if you could have

19

reached that sentence regardless of the range

20

being wrong, we think the error in the range

21

matters and is likely to matter in the great

22

majority of cases.

23
24
25

But I

It anchors people's sentencing

And you're suggesting that we ignore
everything we said about that now.
MR. ELLIS:

Not at all, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official
47
1

think the Court was dealing very clearly with

2

that third prong in Molina-Martinez.

3

question under that third prong, as we see it,

4

is whether that creates, as the Court said, a

5

reasonable probability of a different outcome.

6

That's a predictive judgment that can be based

7

on empirics, and the Court reasonably did so in

8

Molina-Martinez.

9

that as to whether the change was a day or 10

And the

And it doesn't matter for

10

years.

11

whether there's a reasonable probability of a

12

different outcome.

13

It just doesn't.

The question is

And there is.

The question under the fourth prong is

14

whether that's the sort of error that's so

15

egregious we won't submit it to the ordinary

16

rules of party presentation and forfeiture.

17

And that's a broader inquiry, we think, and one

18

in which it matters that it's a day or 10 years

19

and one in which it matters that this is the

20

sort of error that the defendant had every

21

opportunity to raise and, in fact, was uniquely

22

competent to raise.

23

And it matters that the district

24

court, even if we can't say definitely would

25

have, although there's some indication that it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

might -- that he could have, and that sentence

2

would have been reviewed very deferentially on

3

appeal, and it would have been a reasonable

4

one.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

MR. ELLIS:

7

I'm sorry -­

All those things weigh in,

we think.

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- when -- when

9

you're talking about reasonableness, it seems

10

like you're doing substantive reasonableness,

11

which is what the Fifth Circuit was doing with

12

its standard.

13

process right or standard,

14

shock-the-conscience, and applied it to this

15

sentence.

16

It borrowed a substantive due

And it sounds like, with all your

17

three reasons and your argument, which is the

18

only thing that matters is that it doesn't -­

19

that this is a reasonable sentence no matter if

20

it's not the sentence the district court would

21

have given.

22

isn't it?

That's basically your argument,

23

MR. ELLIS:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

why?

We think that matters.
All right.

But

When the three prongs of the fourth -­

2

fairness, integrity, or -- I've forgotten the

3

fourth, but it's in -­

We think it's not unfair

So why isn't it

because -­

That's right.

unfair?

10
11

Public reputation.

MR. ELLIS:

But that's a

That's not a substantive

So a couple responses to

that, Your Honor.
We think it's not unfair because the

18

contemporaneous objection rule is the ordinary

19

rule, and we think in the ordinary case, that

20

applying that rule and the consequences of that

21

rule is fair.

22
23
24
25

We think it's -- it's reasonable to
look at the substantive result -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
this fourth prong says.

That's not what

What this fourth prong

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

appears to say is the fairness, integrity, or

2

public reputation of our judicial system.

3

What's fair about an error that the judge, in

4

part, was a part of that could be easily

5

corrected and that might very well result in a

6

lower sentence to a defendant?

7

about not correcting that error?

8
9

MR. ELLIS:

What's fair

I think what's fair is

that -- I think it -- a system has to have

10

rules and those rules have to have

11

consequences.

12

would understand that, and in the ordinary

13

case, that it does -- just the fact that the

14

defendant didn't raise this error in a timely

15

manner is sufficient reason to say that we're

16

not going to correct it on appeal.

17

And I think that -- that people

You noted the cost, and that's come up

18

several times in this colloquy, in our -- in

19

our discussion, and I think that the cost may

20

be a reason to change the standard, but we

21

don't think it's -- it's a reason to -- that

22

the Court should -- should consider in applying

23

the standard.

24
25

We don't think, for example, that two
otherwise identical trial errors should be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

subjected to a different standard because one

2

came from a two-day trial and the other a

3

two-month trial and, therefore, would be more

4

expensive to correct.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but there again

6

Molina-Martinez is against you, right, because,

7

in that case, we talked about the fact that a

8

remand for resentencing -- I'm quoting now -­

9

"while not costless, does not involve the same

10
11

difficulties as a remand for retrial."
And we talked about the government had

12

this concern over judicial resources, and we

13

specifically rejected that.

14

know, that the resources are not sufficient for

15

us to take that seriously here.

16

MR. ELLIS:

And we said, you

So what the Court said is

17

that it's not the same as a retrial.

18

Court also said is that it doesn't really

19

matter because it's not relevant to the

20

standard under the third prong, and we agree

21

it's the same under the fourth prong, that the

22

costs of resentencing aren't relevant to the

23

application of whether the error itself is one

24

that significantly affects the fairness,

25

integrity, and public reputation of judicial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

What the

Official
52
1

proceedings.

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

If we're going to

3

compare the -- the cost empirically of the two

4

systems, wouldn't we have to account for the

5

fact that under the regime you propose there

6

are a lot more appeals that the courts of

7

appeals have to resolve?

8

In the circuits where this rule exists

9

or this presumption exists, the government

10

frequently confesses error to mathematical

11

mistakes in the guidelines applications and it

12

automatically goes back for resentencing

13

without the need of -- of appellate resources

14

being involved.

15

Should that be a cost that we should

16

consider or -- or is that one you would have us

17

ignore?

18

MR. ELLIS:

So, to be clear, it's my

19

position that cost is not relevant to applying

20

the standard.

It might be -­

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

22

the fourth prong as well?

23

there too?

24
25

MR. ELLIS:

Yes.

Are you including
It's irrelevant

And I also think

that it's not clear empirically that that would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

be true.

2

I think the -- the point of the plain

3

error rule and the narrowness, the reason it's

4

strictly circumscribed, is to maintain the

5

incentives in the first instance to raise those

6

errors, so you never get to the point where

7

someone's filing an appeal about an error they

8

didn't raise.

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That's -- that's

10

just an argument against the plain error rule

11

all together, isn't it?

12

MR. ELLIS:

No, I don't think it is.

13

It's an error for -- for keeping the plain

14

error rule to be a narrow one, to be strictly

15

circumscribed, to maintain the balance between

16

Rule 51 and Rule 52 and maintain the

17

incentives.

18

said about what it's concerned about in

19

applying the plain error rule.

That's what the Court has always

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Are there -­
If the plain error -­
-- are there some

23

courts -- and I -- I don't mean to be facetious

24

because I think I remember that -- are there

25

some courts of appeals that just write the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

district judge a letter and say would it make a

2

difference?

3
4

MR. ELLIS:

So there is this limited

remand procedure that the Court identified -­

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Limited remand?

6

MR. ELLIS:

So the Court

Yes.

7

identified that in Molina-Martinez as a way to

8

mitigate the costs.

9

third prong because the third prong is, is

It's really about the

10

there a reasonable probability of a different

11

sentence?

12

And so you can answer that.

Ask the

13

judge.

14

still the fourth prong and there's still the

15

full resentencing that follows.

16

But if the judge says yes, there's

Post-Molina-Martinez, we haven't found

17

any examples of courts utilizing that for a

18

guidelines range error.

19

Circuit has said that's not about guideline

20

range errors.

21

and whether they treated the guidelines as

22

advisory or mandatory.

In fact, the Seventh

That's about the Booker errors

Thank you,

Ms. Davidson, seven minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KRISTIN L. DAVIDSON

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

6

MS. DAVIDSON:

I'd like to start with

7

what Justice Breyer said about the guidelines

8

as being a specialized body of guidance that

9

has specialized proceedings.

10

And we can't ignore the context and

11

the essential framework of the guidelines and

12

the Court's decisions regarding how those

13

guidelines function just because we're under

14

the fourth prong.

15

And so we disagree that the -- that

16

the factors that the government considers are

17

even appropriate because they're directly at

18

odds with the clear guidance the Court has

19

provided.

20

I also want to address the discussion

21

about 3742.

I agree that whether or not it's

22

still viable doesn't have to be decided today,

23

but I do think it provides clear congressional

24

judgment that at the point at which substantive

25

rights are affected, it -- it's at least

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

Congress's intention that the error is serious

2

enough that it warrants remand.

3

In conclusion, prongs 1, 2, and 3 have

been met.

legal standard under the fourth prong.

6

government presents factors that are

7

appropriate for a district court to consider.

The Fifth Circuit applied the wrong
The

And that's why we ask this Court to
reverse the judgment and remand, with

10

instructions that the sentence be vacated and

11

that this case be remanded to the district

12

court for resentencing.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would you draw a

14

distinction between guidelines errors and other

15

sentencing errors?

16

MS. DAVIDSON:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18
19

Yes.
And what would be the

ground for that?
MS. DAVIDSON:

It would depend on the

20

direct effect the particular sentencing error

21

would have on the outcome, and whether or not

22

the error frustrated the purposes served by the

23

rule in question.

24

than how the guidelines function.

25

And that could be different

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose there was a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

question about whether a defendant was properly

2

treated as a recidivist.

3

MS. DAVIDSON:

That would -- if I

4

understand the question correctly, it would be

5

a district court's evaluation of the conduct as

6

-- as opposed to the guideline.

7

conduct -­

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

If it's purely

No, I'm talking about

a non-guidelines issue, a statutory issue where

10

there's a heavier sentence imposed based on

11

prior criminal conduct.

12

MS. DAVIDSON:

If it were erroneous

13

and that's what the -- if it were erroneous and

14

the district -- and the record demonstrated

15

that the district court was influenced in -- in

16

choosing its sentence because of that error,

17

then I think that it would reflect an error

18

that improperly influences the discretion of

19

the district court and could be serious enough

20

to meet all four prongs.
