ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK PERRY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. PERRY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
SEC ALJs have been invested with the

13

sovereign power to preside over formal

14

adjudications.

15

this Court's precedents, particularly Freytag

16

and Edmond, and any textually and historically

17

accurate construction of the Appointments

18

Clause, which -­

19

They are officers under all of

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Inferior

20

officers -- you're not contesting that -- that

21

they are more than inferior officers?

22

MR. PERRY:

Justice Ginsburg, we are

23

contesting they are inferior officers, not

24

principal officers, correct, in part because

25

their work is supervised by principal officers,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

the commissioners of the SEC, and that

2

relationship of director and then supervision

3

is what marks them as inferior but not as

4

employees.

5

And that's important to note that, in

6

exercising those duties under the direction of

7

the SEC, they have independence in their

8

decisional functions, their hearing functions,

9

and their evidentiary functions.

These are all

10

sovereign powers that we give to judges, that

11

governments give to judges.

12

juger, as Montesquieu put it.

13

those are powers that ordinary citizens,

14

private citizens, simply do not have, absent

15

agreement of the parties, and that governments

16

when they delegate them must do to officers.

17

All of those powers together makes one an

18

officer, as this Court quite firmly and clearly

19

recognized in Freytag.

20

The puissance de
And that is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, of

21

course, the decisions of the ALJs in every case

22

aren't operative until the Commission issues an

23

order of finality, right?

24
25

MR. PERRY:

Well, Your Honor, the

Commission by regulation does issue a finality

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

order.

2

ALJs are deemed the decision of the Commission

3

if not reviewed, and the review period by

4

regulation expires after 42 days.

5

The -- by statute, the decisions of the

And Congress, importantly, gave the -­

6

the ALJs the power to make final decisions.

7

That's in the APA Section 557(b).

8

the right of review in the statute, in the

9

Exchange Act, is discretionary.

10

And -- and

So that when Congress says here is an

11

office of the ALJ that can make a final

12

decision on behalf of the agency, unless the

13

agency chooses to review it, that officer must

14

be invested with the power to enter a final

15

decision, whether or not the -- the agency

16

actually allows that officer to exercise it.

17

There's two levels of authority here,

18

and the one that Congress gave -- because

19

tomorrow the Commission could adopt a new

20

regulation that says:

21

we're not going to review any initial decisions

22

in investment adviser cases under our

23

discretion.

24

25

that 90 percent of ALJ decisions do become

in the court.

5

to show cause a sovereign enough power to

6

designate someone a -- a officer rather than an

7

employee, when it's being done on behalf of,

8

not in the name of, on behalf of the SEC?

9

But it's

Why is merely issuing the order

MR. PERRY:

Well, first, Your Honor,

10

the -- the hearing -- the note -- the hearing

11

notice, which is different than an order to

12

show cause, is issued in the name of the ALJ

13

and goes out under the name of the ALJ, if that

14

matters, as does the subpoena, as does all the

15

document requirements, as does everything

16

related to the hearing.

17

After the order instituting

18

proceedings is issued and it is delegated to an

19

ALJ, the ALJ issues every order in the case.

20

It -- it -- it oversees -- he oversees or she

21

oversees the gathering of the evidence, the

22

admission or exclusion of the evidence, the

23

hearing -- the taking of the depositions, the

24

hearing of the testimony, the convening of the

25

hearing, compulsory settlement, if the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -­

If -- if the

4

provision had been that the bottom line is the

6

they conduct the hearing, decide what evidence

7

would be that their bottom line is:

for two modes of ALJ decision-making:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

If -- if we follow

13

your theory of the case and -- and you prevail,

14

what effect, if any, will that have on ALJs in

15

other agencies, Social Security ALJs?

16

MR. PERRY:

Justice Kennedy, our

17

submission is limited to ALJs who decide

18

adversarial proceedings subject to Sections 556

19

and 557 of the APA.

20

150 ALJs who fit that definition, which is not

21

Social Security ALJs, by the way, in the

22

federal government, in 25 agencies.

23

There are approximately

Some of those may well have already

24

been appointed.

One of the interesting things

25

about this case is, as we have all dug into it,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

it's very obscure how these ALJs are appointed,

2

when we have a constitutional clause that is

3

designed to promote transparency and

4

accountability, not obscurity and opacity.

5

But 150 is the answer to your

6

question, and some of those may already have

7

been properly appointed, and those are the ones

8

who perform the judge-like characters that

9

Congress specified in the APA.

And the

10

Exchange Act, Section 78d-1(a), explicitly

11

adopts Section 556 of the APA for the judges.

12

And I think it's important in the APA,

13

Congress said that a formal adjudication, an

14

on-the-record adjudication under the APA, can

15

be done by three people only:

16

member of the agency, or an ALJ.

through the various agencies.

MR. PERRY:

Justice Sotomayor, the way

we are using the term is adversarial -- by

adversarial, I mean those cases -- enforcement

12

cases are a good example -- where a private

13

citizen is brought against his or her will

14

before a government body to have his or her

15

fate decided.

16

The Social Security Administration -­

17

the vast majority of ALJ determinations are

when a citizen voluntarily goes to the agency

19

and seeks benefits from the government.

They are applicants and -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Perry, if I

22

asked you why is it important for purposes of

23

deciding who's an officer that the person

24

conduct an adversarial hearing, is that what

25

you would say, that the stakes are very high,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13

2

that a person has liberty on the line?
MR. PERRY:

I think the stakes,

3

Justice Kagan, are important, but I would go to

4

the statute actually as the definition.

5

think 556(c) gives us those characteristics,

6

those sovereign powers that can only be

7

exercised by an officer.

8
9

I

So that a statutory officer appointed
under 3105, whose organic statute permits him

10

or her to conduct a formal hearing, an

11

on-the-record adjudication, which this Court

12

has said has collateral estoppel effect, right,

13

in -- in other proceedings, those are due

14

process related.

15

Those are sovereign -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

See, there's something

16

that strikes me as -- as a little bit odd about

17

this argument because, if you -- if you -- we

18

just take a step back a little bit.

19

you have some real complaints about this

20

process and how it happened and the bias that

21

you think the ALJ showed.

22

I mean,

And if that's a problem, it's a hard

23

context in which to think that the solution to

24

the problem is greater -- the greater political

25

accountability that comes from the Appointments

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

Clause.

In other words, this is a situation

2

where we have adjudications, where we typically

3

think we want the decision-maker to be

4

insulated from political pressures.

5

So wouldn't putting those

6

decision-makers even closer to the political

7

body only exacerbate the problem that you're

8

complaining of?

9

MR. PERRY:

Justice Kagan, there's a

10

difference between decisional independence,

11

which is guaranteed by 554(b) of the APA and

12

the Due Process Clause, and structural

13

independence, which the Appointments Clause is

14

designed to ensure responsibility,

15

accountability, transparency, and ultimately

16

liberty, freedom.

17

So that we know -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So then you're

18

saying assume, as Justice Kagan's question

19

indicates, that it's important to the

20

perception of justice that the adjudicator be

21

independent.

22

your argument?

23

Which way does that cut as to
I think that's -­

MR. PERRY:

Your Honor, as to

24

structural independence, it's important for

25

regulated entities, the Commission, the judges,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
15
1

and the courts that review their decisions to

2

know that they are not structurally

3

independent, that they are structurally

4

dependent even if they have statutory

5

decisional independence.

6

So that we believe tying them together

7

as the Appointments Clause requires shows the

8

lines of authority so that reviewing courts and

9

all those stakeholders in the process can

10

participate.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY B. WALL

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

18

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS

19
20
21

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
If I could just start with the

22

government's test, the one that we hope the

23

Court will adopt.

24
25

Under Buckley and Freytag, a
constitutional officer occupies a continuing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

position that's been vested by law with

2

significant discretion to do one of two things:

3

Either to bind to the government or

4

third-parties on important matters or to

5

undertake other important sovereign functions.

6

Here, the Commission's ALJs have been

7

vested by statute with both powers.

They

8

adjudicate disputes that impose liability and

9

sanctions on private individuals, and they can

10

and do issue binding decisions.

11

thus, no meaningful difference between this

12

case and Freytag.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

There is,

How many -­

There are a lot of -­

15

a lot of civil servants who have -- fit within

16

that definition.

17

list, but I think there are.

18

I -- I -- I won't give a

And I think, frankly, I don't know how

19

to decide this case for the following reason:

20

I don't think it would make much difference but

21

for the decision in the PCAOB case, Free

22

Enterprise.

23

combine it with this, then I think, if I adopt

24

your approach, goodbye to the merit civil

25

service at the higher levels and good-bye to

When I read that decision and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1
2

independence of ALJs.
But it requires both.

And you propose

3

a test as to when we can get rid of the ALJs

4

on, I think it's Point 17 of your reply brief,

5

that seems to me does not guarantee them the

6

independence that the APA hoped for.

7

So how do I decide this case?

If I'm

8

going to decide the PCAOB application first, I

9

would say, as I dissented, no, and at that

10

point, it doesn't matter very much and I can go

11

into the totally contradictory mess of what our

12

precedent is on this, I think.

13

But if the answer is yes, then I think

14

I have to look for new approaches as to who is

15

a civil servant and who is an officer of the

16

United States, in which Congress might play a

17

great role.

18

Now I've been very honest in

19

describing what I'm thinking at the moment,

20

which doesn't help you or hurt you.

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

And I'm looking to

you for advice.
MR. WALL:

I -- so two -- I -- two

things, Justice Breyer.

You said in dissent in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

Free Enterprise Fund that all ALJs are

2

executive officers.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know that, but I

4

was taking the SG's test and I was going back

5

to -­

6

MR. WALL:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

Yes.
-- the -- the Freytag

and -- and -­

9

MR. WALL:

10

Right.

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and it was not in

11

front of us, and I was looking for the

12

horribles and listed about, you know, 4,000

13

horribles as a result of a decision that I

14

disagreed with.

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So I -- I don't feel

17

that those words are absolutely written in

18

stone.

19

have to know first about PCAOB before I can say

20

whether I really want to say it does not appear

21

to me now as it appears to have appeared to me

22

then.

But maybe you're right, provide that I

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. WALL:

25

don't think it's a horrible.

Well, I -- here's why I
And we obviously

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

have urged the Court to address the removal

2

issue and what we've tried to say in our brief

3

is we think there's a way to read the statute

4

that avoids the constitutional concerns from

5

the PCAOB case.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, the way to read

7

the statute that you think is that you can

8

dismiss the ALJ for failing to follow policy

9

that may not be written into a rule that

10

they're legally applied, required, or -- and

11

once -- once there is a basis in the record,

12

facts, the MS -- the -- the Systems Protection

13

Board can't even look at it.

14

Well, they're looking -- now that to

15

me is not the kind of protection that the

16

people who wrote the APA intended.

17

MR. WALL:

Justice Breyer -­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's why I say I

19

need to know about that before I can decide

20

this.

21

MR. WALL:

With all respect, we -- I

22

think the Court has got to distinguish what the

23

-- what the -- the drafters of the APA were

24

worried about, and Mr. Perry got at this a

25

little bit, was decisional independence in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

Section 554 of the APA.

2

clear in -- in both of our briefs that we don't

3

think the agencies can impinge on the

4

decisional independence of ALJs.

5

of course, in 3105 said the agency can appoint

6

the ALJ.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So maybe

that's what you mean.

9
10

But Congress,

So we know Congress didn't mean to -­

7
8

And we've been very

MR. WALL:

-- limit it beyond the

department head.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe that's -- but

12

what it says is you can remove an ALJ for

13

failure to follow agency policies -- and I take

14

it that that isn't something embodied in a

15

rule, it's no problem if it's embodied in a

16

17

confine the Board's role to -- the Board,

factful basis exists for the agency's preferred

20

grounds.

Now try that on an Article III judge.

22

25

case until I decide that one.

Now you may be right on that, and my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. WALL:

Well, Justice Breyer, I

2

think the way to decide this case, if you

3

wanted to do it without getting to removal, and

4

we've urged the Court not to do that because,

5

unlike the appointments side, what we're

6

dealing with is largely executive practice, the

7

restrictions on removal are statutory, we're

8

limited in our ability to get our own house in

9

order there.

10

But if you wanted to sever the two, I

11

think what you'd say is Freytag sets up a

12

two-part test for when you're an officer of the

13

United States.

14

don't even need to decide whether one or the

15

other is sufficient or necessary.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. WALL:

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

ALJs satisfy both.

So you

We can do that.

And then -­
But -- but, again,

19

last point.

One thing I'm certain of, or

20

fairly certain, moderately certain -­

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- that the

23

Constitution does not inhibit the creation of a

24

merit-based civil service and an adjudicatorily

25

merit -- merit-based system of hearing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

examiners, ALJs.

2

If I start with that premise and then

3

don't know quite what that sentence on page 17

4

means and don't know how PCAOB applies, you

5

see?

6

MR. WALL:

I do, Justice Breyer.

7

one, we haven't said a word about the civil

8

service.

But,

We're talking only about ALJs who are

10

private liability -- liability and sanctions on

11

private individuals.

12

Two, we have been very careful not to

13

touch pay or compensation or directing of

14

decisions or any of the rest.

15

talking about is saying, look, 3105 says the

16

agency can appoint.

17

But -- but our -- our founding

13

difference between -- not with ALJs but with

14

other executive officers.

15

All of this seems a little bit difficult

MR. WALL:

Right.

So we have tried to

16

come up with a test that I think really

17

harmonizes the Court's cases and the historical

18

practice, and it focuses on a handful of

19

things.

20

Everyone agrees that that -- that's present

21

here.

22
23

25

Do you have a continuing office?

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

is continuous.
MR. WALL:

Exactly.

So then you've

got to look -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Almost anybody who

2

works for the government works for the

3

government under some statute.

4

MR. WALL:

That's right.

And then

5

you've got to look at what are the powers that

6

have been vested by law in that office, and

7

you've got to ask, okay, do those powers

8

involve significant discretion over one of two

9

things:

The power to bind on important matters

10

or other really important sovereign functions

11

of the kind that historically, even absent the

12

power to bind, were performed only by the

13

executive branch, generally only by

14

high-ranking members of the executive branch,

15

and that really do require the exercise of

16

significant discretion.

25

MR. WALL:

What is the

Oh, we understand our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

current line here to be a refinement of what

2

OLC said in its 2007 OLC opinion.

3

was you can be an officer because you have the

4

power to bind on important matters, but you

5

historically have been an officer in other ways

6

that isn't a complete test, it's

7

under-inclusive, and there isn't any support, I

8

think, for the own name requirement, which is

9

the manipulable part I was trying to get at

10

What it said

earlier.

11

So we understand what we've been doing

12

here to try to boil down that very lengthy memo

13

and the other OLC opinions and to try to come

14

up with a test that we really do think moves

15

the ball forward from significant governmental

16

authority in Buckley.

Assume that the perception and fact

compromise that is the APA and square it with

exercise important functions on behalf of the

6

for the Commission to say:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTON METLITSKY ON

21
22
23
24
25

BEHALF OF THE COURT-APPOINTED AMICUS CURIAE
IN SUPPORT OF THE JUDGMENT BELOW
MR. METLITSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Other than a narrow

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
35
1

historically-grounded exception concerning

2

diplomatic offices, an officer of the United

3

States is someone with power to bind the

4

government or private parties in the name of

5

his own office.

6

In contrast, someone whose acts have

7

no binding effect without the sanction of an

8

officer is not himself an officer of the United

9

States.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If I were

11

trying to figure out who an officer is, I think

12

I might have started with Freytag.

13

test that you just proposed doesn't seem

14

similar to what Freytag talked about, which was

15

a laundry list -- not that long perhaps -- of

16

particular -- particular authorities.

17

don't see, other than the contempt power, I

18

suppose, what's different here than in Freytag.

19

MR. METLITSKY:

And your

And I

Well, the contempt

20

power, I think, is crucial.

So in -- in

21

Freytag -- there are two alternative holdings

22

in Freytag.

23

consistent with our rule that's about the fact

24

that special trial judges can enter final

25

decisions.

The second one is clearly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
36
1

The first alternative holding is that

2

special trial judges are officers of the United

3

States because they can preside over trials,

4

rule on the admissibility of evidence, take

5

testimony, and enforce their own discovery

6

orders through contempt.

7

Now contempt clearly is a power that

8

can only be exercised by an officer of the

9

United States.

10
11

It's a coercive power that

binds the parties.
This Court never considered a position

12

that only included one or all or some of the

13

first three authorities.

14

Legal Counsel, the Attorney General, and

15

Congress have, for more than a century, all

16

concluded that, for example, commissions that

17

are set up to investigate but that don't have

18

any binding authority at the end of the

19

investigation do not set up offices of the

20

United States -­

But the Office of

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's hard -­

22

MR. METLITSKY:

-- even though they

23

have the same -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's hard to think,

Mr. Metlitsky, that Freytag really thought that

that was all important.

talk about the power of contempt until the

3

second half of the opinion.

4

You know, they don't

In the first half of the opinion,

5

they're just talking about we can respond to

6

discovery violations without necessarily

7

suggesting that they're talking about the

8

contempt power.

9

So, if you just read that first part

10

of Freytag, you'd get no sense that it's

11

crucial to the decision that there exists this

12

contempt power.

13

MR. METLITSKY:

So, as we acknowledged

14

in our brief, you could read Freytag broadly,

15

obviously, much more broadly than the rule

16

we're proposing, but you don't have to read it

17

that way.

around this -- the commonalities of these

11

judges and the judges in Freytag.

But the adjudicators here are not
investigators.

They are deciders.

That seems

a big difference and, again -­

11

MR. METLITSKY:

Well, so -­

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- seems to separate

13

the Warren Commission type bodies from both the

14

judges here and the judges in Freytag.

15

MR. METLITSKY:

I -- I completely

16

agree with that, but that would exclude, I

17

think, the second -- the second part of the

18

government's test, which is somebody can be an

19

officer even if they don't have the power to

20

bind.

21

So the question in this case, I think,

22

really is whether ALJs have the power to bind

23

and whether that power is vested in their

24

office.

MR. METLITSKY:

3

The problem I have -­
-- of the -- in your

own name.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

The problem I have

5

with this, the whole thing, is I have no idea

6

of what the nature of jobs are throughout the

7

civil service, I mean, in terms of importance.

8

There are probably people in the civil service

9

who can order inspections of nuclear power

10

plants.

11

can order that the company be open at 14 -- at

12

-- at 2:00 in the afternoon so we can come in

13

and see if there's a dangerous situation.

14

There are probably people at OSHA who

There are probably people in the EPA

15

who can go out and say your, whatever it is,

16

violates this or that.

17

respects, they have to have the door open.

18

They have to do this or that.

19

not be.

And in certain

But there might

20

But I don't -- I don't know that

21

anyone in this case has methodically gone

22

through civil service positions to tell me

23

whether or not, if we decide one way or the

24

other and on the theory, we are driving wedges

25

of dependence into what was to be since Chester

2

MR. METLITSKY:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

and I do not know what to do next.

5

MR. METLITSKY:

I -- I -­
That's my concern,

I -- I completely

6

agree with you, Justice Breyer, that that is a

7

concern, which is why our test doesn't turn on

8

importance.

9

I think theirs does.

And then you're

10

going to have lots of problems like you just

11

identified.

12

importance -- importance at all.

13

legal authority to either bind the government,

14

make the government do particular things, or

15

bind private parties.

16

Our test doesn't turn on
It turns on a

And -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I -- I think -- it

17

seems to me your test, maybe I don't understand

18

it, but it -- it seems to me potentially very

19

broad and also quite vague.

20

Now, the power to bind, an enormous

21

number of executive branch officials have the

22

power to bind the government in one way or

23

another.

24
25

Would you disagree with that?
MR. METLITSKY:

I don't disagree with

the de facto power to bind, but I agree with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

Mr. Wall that the relevant question is whether

2

the -- where the power has been vested, which

3

is the import of our second precondition.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So, I mean,

5

anybody -- any attorney who tries a case on

6

behalf of the government has the power to bind,

7

makes decisions during the course of the trial

8

that are not reviewed by anybody else, I won't

9

call this witness, I won't ask this question.

10

Okay.

11

power to bind is enormous.

12

So the power to -- the -- the -- the

Vested by what -- and you say it has

13

to be in the name of that -- of the office.

14

How do we find out whether it's in the name of

15

the office?

16

MR. METLITSKY:

Well, it's whether the

17

person -- so take your example, an AUSA at a

18

trial makes a binding concession or an

19

Assistant to the Solicitor General makes a

20

binding concession in this Court.

21

The reason that person doesn't have to

22

be appointed by the president with the advice

23

and consent of the Senate is because he is

24

exercising the authority of the Office of the

25

Solicitor General or of the U.S. Attorney.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

He's acting in the name of that office.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Let's take an

3

Assistant Attorney General.

4

person is an officer of the United States,

5

right?

6
7
8
9

MR. METLITSKY:

I assume that that

An Assistant Attorney

General, yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, and so, if the

Assistant Attorney General for the Civil

10

Division or the Antitrust Division does

11

something, is -- is that person exercising the

12

authority of the Civil Division or the

13

Antitrust Division or the authority of the

14

Department of Justice?

15

MR. METLITSKY:

It's the -- well, if

16

he's exercising authority that has been

17

delegating -- delegated to him, he's exercising

18

the power of his own office.

19

you know, for example, that precise example,

20

the head of the, say, Civil Division is at the

21

top of the brief.

22

The -- the reason

So, when the government makes a

23

decision, a litigation decision, which is a

24

decision that binds the government, the person

25

at the top of the brief is always the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

responsible officer.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

But is that what it

3

turns on, whether -- who's listed at the top of

4

the brief?

5

find out whether it's vested in the office?

6

we look at a regulation?

7

practice?

8
9

Do -- do we look at a statute to

MR. METLITSKY:

Do

Do we look at

So it -- it doesn't

turn on who's at the top of the brief, but

10

who's at the top of the brief derives from the

11

existing legal authority.

12

In the Justice Department, I think

13

it's entirely -- almost all of the authority is

14

delegated from the Attorney General.

15

So one statute vests all of the powers

16

in the Justice Department to the Attorney

17

General, another statute allows the Attorney

18

General to delegate those powers, and so he'll

19

delegate -­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Does it strike you as

21

a little bit odd that, essentially, that would

22

mean that the executive branch gets to decide

23

who's an officer and who's not an officer?

24

Right?

25

statutes just vest this in the Attorney

Take the Attorney General, most of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

General.

2

delegates his power out to other people.

3

It's then the Attorney General that

He can decide to, he can decide not

4

to, he can decide where it goes.

5

based on those decisions, it seems, you would

6

be saying whether a particular person is an

7

officer or not.

8
9

MR. METLITSKY:

No.

And -- and

So -- so the

question is whether a -- a particular

10

delegation to a particular person is lawful.

11

So, if Congress has created an office -- so

12

Congress has created the Office of the Deputy

13

Attorney General, who is appointed by the

14

president with the advice and consent of the

15

Senate.

16

authorized to delegate to that person the

17

authority to bind.

That means the Attorney General is

18

And so that person uses that

19

authority, for example, in the oversight of the

20

U.S. Attorneys to direct U.S. Attorneys about

21

how to prosecute corporations, right?

22

the Thompson memo.

23

They're issued in the name of the Office of the

24

Deputy Attorney General.

25

That's

It's the McNulty memo.

If the Attorney General tried to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

delegate that authority to somebody that's not

2

an officer, then that person would be -­

3

couldn't exercise the power.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I feel -- I feel as

5

though I'm missing something, because what you

6

just said to me seems to make everything

7

dependent on whether Congress has created an

8

office.

9

requirement, can it?

10

And that can't be the only

MR. METLITSKY:

No.

The question is

11

just somebody's been delegated authority.

12

they're an officer -- is it -- the first

13

question is, is it an officer function, right?

14

If it is, then somebody that has -- only

15

somebody that's been appointed under the

16

Appointments Clause can exercise it.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

If

But if it's -- if it's

18

a question of -- so the -- an Assistant

19

Attorney General is an officer because that -­

20

certain powers are delegated by the Attorney

21

General?

22

MR. METLITSKY:

Right.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

And the U.S. Attorney,

24
25

the same thing, right?
MR. METLITSKY:

I think the U.S.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

Attorney might have statutory authorities too,

2

but -­

3
4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But -- but that's what

I was suggesting.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well -­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But then everything

7

depends on whether the Attorney General in fact

8

makes a delegation or does not make delegation.

9

MR. METLITSKY:

Well, that's true.

10

That's how Congress set up the scheme.

So the

11

-- the Attorney General gets to decide which

12

officers exercise what authority.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose then the

14

-- the U.S. attorney or -- or the head of one

15

of the litigating divisions delegates certain

16

authorities to somebody within that office.

17

Does that make that person a -- a -- an

18

officer?

19

MR. METLITSKY:

No, because the -­

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why?

21

MR. METLITSKY:

Because the authority

22

rests with the -- the U.S. Attorney.

That's -­

23

that's the relevant office.

24

can delegate de facto authority, but the U.S.

25

attorney is always going to be held accountable

The U.S. Attorney

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

for every decision.

2

So, I mean, that happens as a matter

3

of fact in U.S. Attorneys offices.

As you

4

said, the assistants -- Assistant United States

5

Attorneys have a tremendous amount of

6

discretion.

7

when they exercise that discretion, the person

8

that's going to be held accountable for -- for

9

that -- for the exercise of that discretion is

10

the U.S. Attorney, which means that it doesn't

11

-- since the U.S. Attorney is already

12

100 percent accountable for the decision, it

13

doesn't matter who appointed the assistant.

14

You don't have to hold the U.S. Attorney or

15

anybody else accountable for the appointment.

But everybody understands that

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, I -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, you

18

said on -- your -- your friend, Mr. Perry, said

19

in his reply brief, "This Court has never held

20

that an adjudicatory official is not an

21

officer."

22

Do you agree with that?

23

MR. METLITSKY:

Yes, but an

24

adjudicatory official is somebody that gets to

25

decide a case, to -- to bind the parties at the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

end of the day.

That's why, for example, in

2

Stern against Marshall, what this Court was

3

concerned about, about non-Article III judges

4

adjudicating private rights, was that they

5

could issue final judgments of the United

6

States.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8

MR. METLITSKY:

9

That's what Justice

Alito's -­

10
11

So -- so -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry, go

ahead.

12

MR. METLITSKY:

Justice Alito's

13

concurrence -- your concurrence in the -- in

14

the Amtrak case identified a -- an Appointments

15

Clause problem with binding arbitration,

16

binding.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if -- if

18

the statute said the ALJ decision -- there you

19

can seek review within 90 days; if after 90

20

days review hasn't been granted, that decision

21

is final.

22

you, or would the mere possibility of

23

discretionary review mean that the adjudicatory

24

official did not have binding authority?

25

Would that be a different case for

MR. METLITSKY:

So I think that's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

harder case than this case.

2

the -- the finality order grants affirmative

3

sanction to the decision.

4

at least 1822 -­

5

So, in this case,

And the rule since

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But your

6

friend says that's really just a notice, that

7

we're not going to review it.

8
9

MR. METLITSKY:

Well, it's -- they say

that, but what -- what the finality orders all

10

actually say is that the orders contained in

11

the initial decision are hereby declared

12

effective.

13

It's -- it's affirmative sanction

14

granted to the decision.

15

the main Supreme Court's or Supreme Judicial

16

Court's opinion in 1822, somebody who doesn't

17

act, that can't take effect without the

18

sanction of an officer is not an officer of the

19

United States, which is precisely what's going

20

on here.

21

And since at least

Now, in your hypo, there's -- there's

22

a distinction between a decision that becomes

23

effective by itself but that then can be

24

reviewed.

25

courts of appeals and, you know, petitions for

That's like what happens in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

cert in this Court.

2

is reasonably going to say that this Court is

3

fully responsible for every court of appeals

4

decision.

5

And I don't think anybody

There's a different kind of order that

6

cannot take effect at all without the act of a

7

superior.

8

it might just be denying review.

9

I think that's a harder case, and I think the

The act might be plenary review or
Like I said,

10

question would turn on whether you could

11

reasonably hold the superior accountable for

12

the decision by virtue of the fact that he

13

decided not to engage in plenary review and

14

instead denied review.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

One of the

16

principles that caused the drafters to give the

17

authority to appoint officers to the president

18

was the important one of accountability.

19

MR. METLITSKY:

Exactly.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And in this

21

case, if -- if the individual were an officer,

22

he would have to be appointed by the

23

Commission, and people would know who was

24

responsible for whatever conduct or misconduct

25

or decisions he would -- he would take.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

But in this case, you don't have that

2

accountability.

3

blame us.

4

say:

5

And, instead, it's something in the

6

administrative bureaucracy which operates as

7

insulation from the political accountability

8

that the drafters of the Constitution intended.

9

The Commission can say:

We didn't do it.

Don't blame me.

Don't

The President can

I didn't appoint them.

MR. METLITSKY:

Right.

So -- so I

10

think that is the fundamental question in the

11

case.

12

Mr. Chief Justice, for two reasons.

13

And I -- I respectfully disagree,

I think the Commission is going to be

14

held 100 percent accountable for every single

15

decision, whether it's initially made by an ALJ

16

or not, for two reasons:

17

affirmatively sanction it.

18

long-standing rule that if an act requires

19

affirmative section -- sanction, that the

20

person that did that act is not an officer.

21

That's why that rule exists.

22

First, they
That's why the

Second, even if you disagree that the

23

ALJ's decisions -- if you think they're

24

binding, the way that Congress set up the

25

structure here makes clear that the decision is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

always the decision of the Commission.

2

The Commission is allowed to delegate

3

authority to an ALJ or to other delegees under

4

78d-1(a).

5

authority under subsection (b) to engage in

6

plenary review.

7

the Commission to escape responsibility if it

8

doesn't engage in plenary review, because

9

subsection (c) says that every decision is

Congress gives the Commission

But Congress does not allow

10

going to be deemed the decision of the

11

Commission.

12

So, if somebody comes to the

13

Commission and says that decision was -- you

14

know, was bad, was wrong, the Commission cannot

15

say, oh, I don't know, that was my ALJ.

16

would be like me saying I don't know, that was

17

my associate, like a judge saying I don't know,

18

that was my law clerk.

That

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's the line

20

that makes somebody an agent or not?

21

speak about ALJs in this context being agents

22

of the SEC commissioners when the SEC

23

commissioners didn't pick them, don't supervise

24

them, essentially don't have anything to do

25

with their work other than reviewing it?

Can we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1
2

So what defines someone acting as an
agent of an office?

3

MR. METLITSKY:

So I don't think

4

common law agency is exactly the right frame.

5

I think I agree, again, with Mr. Wall, the -­

6

the initial question is where the authority,

7

the legal authority, to act is -- is vested.

8

I think that's -- the first example of

9

that is the deputy marshals that were mentioned

10

before, right?

11

establishes in Section 27 of the first

12

Judiciary Act the office of a marshal, who's an

13

inferior officer, and allows the marshal to

14

appoint deputies, who are non-officers because

15

they're not appointed by somebody who's allowed

16

to make an appointment under the Appointments

17

Clause.

18

So -- so the Congress

They have all the same duties as the

19

marshal, but they're understood to be acting in

20

the name of the marshal's office.

21

even though district courts, under Section 27,

22

had authority to remove the -- the deputies,

23

right?

24
25

That's so

So -- so I don't -- again, I don't
think the -- the elements of common law agency

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

need to be satisfied.

2

Congress demonstrates that it's vesting

3

authority in a particular office, as it did

4

here, making clear that any decision is going

5

to be deemed the decision of the Commission, I

6

think the agency has to have at least some

7

ability to affect the decision.

8

course, the agency has plenary ability to

9

affect the decision as to facts, as to law, as

10

-- as to everything.

11

can't -­

12

I do think that when

But here, of

So the fact that they

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So are you

13

saying that anybody whose decisions are subject

14

to review can never be an officer?

15
16

MR. METLITSKY:

No, no, not at all.

But -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I

18

thought you were suggesting that the reason

19

that the ALJs are not officers is that the

20

Commission has the discretionary power to

21

review their decisions?

22

MR. METLITSKY:

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

So -­
And you -- and

24

you seem to be putting a lot of -- I'm sorry,

25

go ahead.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

MR. METLITSKY:

No.

So -- so they are

2

not officers for -- for two reasons:

3

that they don't have, in our view, decisions to

4

make binding -- the authority to make binding

5

decisions in the first place.

6

One is

And, second, because all the authority

7

-- if they had authority to make binding

8

decisions, that authority would be to make

9

binding decisions that are actually decisions

10

of the Commission -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

MR. METLISTSKY:

13

-- not the decisions

of the -­

14
15

And -- and -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- they don't have

authority to make binding decisions because?

16

MR. METLITSKY:

Because the -- the

17

question -- so the statute applicable here,

18

78d-1, is an authorization of delegation.

19

Right?

20

authority to the ALJ.

21

The Commission is allowed to delegate

And so the question is, what authority

22

did the Commission delegate to the ALJ?

So

23

first you can look at 17 CFR 201.111(i), which

24

is on 16A of our green brief.

25

ALJs to prepare an initial decision as provided

It authorizes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
58
1

in Section 201.360.

2

So, if you go to 201.360(d), which is

3

on 23A of the green brief, (d)(1) says that the

4

Commission can engage in plenary review either

5

on petition or, you know, on its own

6

initiative; (d)(2) says that an order won't

7

become final and effective without the issuance

8

of a finality order.

9

So, in other words, the -­

10
11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So everything in the

end depends on that?

12

MR. METLITSKY:

No.

We -- so there

13

are two preconditions for our test.

14

one depends on that.

15

the -- whatever the ALJ -­

16
17

The first

The second one is the -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But as to the

first one -­

18

MR. METLITSKY:

Yes.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- as to whether they

20

have binding authority, it all comes down to

21

this finality order?

22

MR. METLITSKY:

Yes.

They don't have

23

bind -- well, that's why they don't have

24

binding authority, because the Commission has

25

to -­

59

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Even -­

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it seems

3

to me, I mean, we've heard about the

4

independence of the adjudicator.

5

be suggesting that he is not an officer because

6

he doesn't have the kind of independence that

7

it's been suggested the APA and other things

8

were designed to promote.

9

MR. METLITSKY:

You seem to

Well, no.

So the APA

10

was -- was a compromise.

It granted ALJs

11

structural independence:

Tenure, salary,

12

various ex parte rules and the like, but the

13

one thing they explicitly did not grant ALJs

14

was decision-making authority, policy-making

15

authority; in other words, the authority to

16

make binding decisions.

17

That power always rests with the

18

agency, which is the crucial question for

19

whether somebody is an officer of the United

20

States.

If you -- did you

22

come across in your research anywhere anything

23

like this that -- because it does say an

24

officer of the United States whose appointment

25

shall be established by law.

That suggests

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
60
1

Congress has a role.

2

And so, in the set of statutes that

3

doesn't say, there would be some criteria where

4

Congress, if they establish it like this, say

5

major policy-making authority, independently,

6

and maybe some instances adjudicatory authority

7

to make binding decisions, they're officers.

8
9

In other cases, clearly not.
agents.

They're

But there'd be a middle range where

10

you'd look to the statute itself and you'd see

11

if in that statute Congress has written

12

significant parts that are not consistent with

13

appointment by the department itself and/or not

14

subject to two levels of for cause removal.

15

MR. METLITSKY:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17
18

Well, so I -­
Did anything -- have

you come across anything like that?
MR. METLITSKY:

There -- there are

19

lots of statutes dealing with how people are

20

appointed in various agencies.

21

very clear that Congress did not intend people

22

to be officers of the United States.

23

example is that there's a statute in the

24

organic -- the organic statute of the Federal

25

Aviation Administration grants the

Sometimes it's

One

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
61
1

administrator authority to -- to appoint

2

everyone in the agency, essentially other than

3

the deputy, and the administrator is not the

4

head of a department.

5

department is the Secretary of Transportation.

6

So anybody the administrator is appointing

7

under that statute is not going to be an

8

officer.

The head of the

9

That doesn't apply here because 3105

10

actually does grant agencies the authority to

11

appoint ALJs.

12

think they're officers because, in 1966,

13

Congress, when it codified Title V, wrote a

14

definition of officer, wrote a definition of

15

employee.

16

were referred to as officers.

17

statute switched all those references to make

18

them refer to employees.

You know that Congress doesn't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You said -­

Mr. Metlitsky, as -­

21

as I listen to you, and especially as I compare

22

your test to some of the others on offer, you

23

know, there seems to be a good deal to be said

24

for yours, except I don't know where it's

25

coming from, honestly.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

So you spent a lot of time in your

2

brief talking like this is a historical test,

3

this is a traditional test.

4

MR. METLITSKY:

Right.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I guess it seems

6

to me like the test actually, it's sort of the

7

opposite, the test you would make up if you

8

were doing everything on a blank slate.

9

don't really see what the source of this test

10
11

is.

But I

So tell me what it is.
MR. METLITSKY:

So -- so the source

12

for the first part of the test that you need to

13

have binding authority, I really -- I think is

14

-- has been accepted at least since 1822 when

15

the main supreme judicial court explained that

16

an officer of the United States is somebody who

17

has been delegated a portion of the sovereign

18

authority of the United States, meaning the

19

authority to bind, and that somebody whose acts

20

don't take effect without the sanction of an

21

officer is not an officer.

22

That's what that opinion held and it's

23

been understood to be authoritative since then.

24

That -- that's essentially the Office of Legal

25

Counsel test from 2007.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

The second part of the test is really

2

I think exactly what Mr. -- Mr. Wall said.

3

There's always going to be a question of where

4

the legal authority to act is, because

5

otherwise every person with discretion like

6

every AUSA is going to be considered an

7

officer, even though the U.S. Attorney is going

8

to be held 100 percent accountable for every

9

decision in his or her office.

10

I think the -- the first place where

11

you can see that -- that relationship of, you

12

know, basically agent to officer is Section 27

13

and 28 of the First Judiciary Act with the

14

marshal and the deputy marshal.

15

One of the things that under Section

16

28 the deputy marshal was authorized to do was,

17

when the marshal died, to execute writs in the

18

name of the deceased marshal until a new

19

marshal was chosen.

20

So the -- sort of the second part of

21

our test, which asks whether somebody's

22

authorized to act in the name of their own

23

office or only in the name of somebody else's

24

office, just reflects that principle, which I

25

think is, as we've talked about, ubiquitous in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

actual government practice.

2

It's why Assistants to the Solicitor

3

General don't need to be appointed by the

4

president with the advice and consent of the

5

Senate since I don't think there's a statute

6

that actually authorizes the Attorney General

7

to appoint them himself.

8

If the Court has no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MARK PERRY ON

13

BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

14
15

MR. PERRY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

16

Three brief points, if I may:

17

First, every official who satisfied my

18

friend Mr. Metlitsky's test would be a

19

principal officer of the United States.

20

If you can bind the government or

21

private parties in your own name with no

22

supervision, that's a principal officer.

23

Court rejected that as a test for inferior

24

officers in Edmond, which involved judges who

25

could never make final decisions unless their

Heritage Reporting Corporation

This

Official
65
1

superiors allowed it.

2

And the Weiss case, which involved

3

trial judges in the military whose opinions

4

were never final, which my friend never

5

mentions and never cites in his briefs, because

6

he -- they cannot meet the finality test.

7

In any event, SEC ALJs do meet the

8

finality test.

9

discretionary right of review, which means it

10

has the discretion not to review, which means

11

they're statutorily authorized to enter final

12

decisions of the Commission.

although, of course, in -- in Freytag and CFTC

9

10

in the context of constitutional challenges to

11

agency actions.

12

This case, of course, is here on

13

direct review.

14

there are -- we -- we put the numbers in our

brief -- there are 13 other similarly-situated

16

cases in the entire federal system.
