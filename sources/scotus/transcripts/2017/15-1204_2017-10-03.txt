ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

This Court has often stressed the

12

breadth of Congress's constitutional authority

13

to establish the rules under which aliens will

14

be allowed to enter and remain in the United

15

States.

16

This case squarely implicates that

17

principle.

18

removal proceedings, the question whether

19

members of a certified class will be detained

20

and the question whether they will be allowed

21

into the United States are simply two sides of

22

the same coin.

23

During the pendency of Respondents'

In practical effect, Respondents

24

assert a constitutional right to be released

25

into this country for the remainder of their

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

4
1

removal proceedings if those proceedings last

2

for more than six months and the government

3

cannot prove flight risk or dangerousness by

4

clear and convincing evidence.

5

This Court's decisions make clear that

6

Respondents have no such right.

7

like to begin with the arriving alien subclass.

8

The statutory provision that's most directly at

9

issue for these purposes is at page 152a of the

10
11

If I may, I'd

petition appendix.
And this one deals particularly with

12

what -- what I think is the most important

13

subset of the arriving alien subclass; that is,

14

individuals who come to the country for the

15

first time, they pass a credible fear screening

16

for asylum purposes, and they're then placed in

17

removal proceedings.

18

And near the top of page 152a, in

19

Romanette II, referral of certain aliens, it

20

says if the asylum officer determines at the

21

time of the interview that the alien has a

22

credible fear of persecution, the alien shall

23

be detained for further consideration of the

24

application for asylum.

25

And so, in the very provision in which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

5
1

Congress was dealing with aliens who passed the

2

credible fear screening, it was making clear

3

that the finding of a credible fear confers no

4

entitlement to be released into the United

5

States.

6

because it means that the alien won't be placed

7

in expedited removal and have -- will have a

8

thorough chance to -- to prove his compliance

9

with the prerequisites for asylum, but it

It's an important step in the process

10

doesn't confer any right to be released into

11

the United States.

To the con -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There is -- there

is a possibility of parole, is it?

14

MR. STEWART:

There is a possibility

15

of parole.

That's entrusted to the discretion

16

of DHS.

17

criteria that the Respondents would have the

18

immigration judge make in bond hearings.

19

is, it's the policy of DHS that if an alien

20

passes a credible fear screening, and DHS is

21

adequate -- is able adequately to verify his

22

identity, is satisfied that the alien is not a

23

flight risk and will not be dangerous if

24

released into the community.

25

some countervailing consideration, the policy

That's made under some of the same

That

Unless there's

2

country.

I think -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you give me any

4

idea of numbers?

5

requirement, 20 percent, or do we know?

6

Do 10 percent meet that

MR. STEWART:

We really don't know.

7

DHS doesn't keep statistics as to -- to the

8

numbers.

9

either a formality in the sense of aliens being

10

always or almost always paroled; neither is it

11

a nullity.

12

don't think we really have reliable statistical

13

evidence.

14

I don't think it's a -- it's not

But between those two extremes, I

I think there was -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I thought

15

that we had some.

16

in 2012, ICE granted parole to 80 percent of

17

arriving aliens.

18

to 47 percent.

19

And from what I understand,

In 2015, the number dropped
And it may be lower now.

So my question is it's obviously the

20

executive alone making this determination; what

21

other area of law have we permitted a

22

government agent on his or her own, without a

23

neutral party looking at that decision, to

24

detain someone indefinitely?

25

MR. STEWART:

Well, I -- first of all,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

7
1

I would not accept the premise that this is

2

indefinite detention.

3

no outer limit in terms of a number of days,

4

but it is detention that is specifically

5

pending a determination of eligibility for -­

6

for asylum.

7

It's true that there is

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, but that -­

8

that assumes that that determination is going

9

to be done in some expeditious way, but we know

10

as a matter of fact that these determinations

11

can sometimes take years.

12

MR. STEWART:

They can sometimes take

13

a long time.

14

are detained are expedited by the immigration

15

judges and by the BIA.

16

quickly than cases involving non-detained

17

aliens.

18

The -- the cases in which aliens

So they do move more

I guess the first thing I would say in

19

response to your question, is there any other

20

area of law, the Court has said time after time

21

that insofar as people arriving -- aliens

22

arriving at our shores are concerned, whatever

23

process Congress chooses to give is due

24

process.

25

the country -­

Aliens, once they've built up ties to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

8
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

the problem with that is that that's

3

lawlessness.

4

we're not a country of law, that we're a

5

country of arbitrariness in detaining people,

6

locking them up.

7

Well, but the -­

That's basically saying that

Perhaps let's -- let's -- answer this

8

question:

In which ways is immigration

9

detention different than criminal detention?

I

10

mean, I -- I understand right now that when you

11

detain aliens, you put them in orange suits,

12

they are shackled during visitation and court

13

visits, they are subject to surveillance and

14

strip searches, they are referred to by number,

15

not by name.

16
17
18

So in which ways is immigration
detention different than criminal detention?
MR. STEWART:

Well, I think the -- the

19

real difference is the justification for the

20

detention.

21

criminal detention, at least with respect to

22

convicted prisoners, obviously, is that they've

23

found -- been found guilty of a crime, and for

24

that, you need judicial process.

25

That is, the justification for

There -- there are some circumstances

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

9
1

outside this country where aliens who want to

2

apply for a visa, for instance, or who want to

3

assert an entitlement to refugee status can do

4

so outside this country.

5

avenues are available, during the period while

6

U.S. Government officials are deciding whether

7

to grant the request, the alien doesn't need to

8

be detained.

9

shores of the United States, the only two

And where those

But when the alien arrives at the

10

options are detention and release into the

11

community.

12

And so the principle that the alien

13

has no constitutional right to be released into

14

the community necessarily compels detention.

15

Now, the other respect in which -­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Stewart, there

17

are -- there is something in between.

18

doesn't have to be release, you are fancy free.

19

You can -- they can monitor.

20

monitoring devices to check on the person who's

21

been released.

22

MR. STEWART:

It

They can use

There are various forms

23

of monitoring and supervision that the

24

government can use.

25

basically release even though it's release upon

I think it's still

Heritage Reporting Corporation

10

conditions or with some form of monitoring.

2

But the Court in Demore versus Kim

3

says the Due Process Clause doesn't require

4

Congress to use the least restrictive means

5

with respect to detention of aliens.

6
7

JUSTICE BREYER:

The statute doesn't

say -­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

That -­

Mr. Stewart?
Justice

Breyer?

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

The statute doesn't

12

say about whether there'll be bail hearings or

13

not.

It just says arrest and detain.

14

We detain people whenever we stop them

15

for Miranda briefly, whenever -- not for -- you

16

know, stop and search, frisk and search, et

17

cetera.

18

Normally, if you were to say detain somebody,

19

you would then possibly -- in most cases, you'd

20

give them a bail hearing, all right?

21

We detain them when we arrest them.

Now, why is the statute different

22

here?

In X-K-, I think, the agency said we'll

23

give some of the people, those found within 100

24

miles of the border, we'll give some of them

25

bail hearings.

And, of course, if they're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

11
1

found more than 100 miles from the border, they

2

always get bail hearings.

3

MR. STEWART:

Right.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

But the people who -­

5

who are just arriving at LAX, you know, or

6

LaGuardia or JFK or something like that, and

7

who have a credible -- a credible claim of

8

prosecution, they don't get bail hearings.

9

Now, that to me is a little odd,

10

particularly when, as Justice Sotomayor said is

11

true, we give triple ax murderers, at least

12

people who are accused of such, bail hearings.

13

Are they dangerous?

14

Some of these people in the first category, you

15

know, they might have relatives in Los Angeles.

16

They might even have a green card which

17

somebody decides is no longer valid.

18

Are they risk of flight?

And so what's the basis for reading

19

the word "detained" sometimes to allow bail

20

hearings at the discretion of the agency; other

21

times not to allow bail hearings and keeping

22

the people possibly for a year, a year and a

23

half, in a jail cell without -- sorry, I don't

24

mean my voice to rise -- but -- but with -­

25

without even a bail hearing?

Where?

Where -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

I mean, the word "detain" doesn't say that.

2

just doesn't say.

3

MR. STEWART:

It

Well, Sections 1225 and

4

1226 have traditionally been understood to get

5

at different categories of aliens.

6

provision that we use when we arrest somebody

7

who is within the -- who has entered the United

8

States -- or is within the United States; 1225

9

is the one we use when we are dealing with

10

1226 is the

aliens who arrive at our shores.

11

Now, there is a tweak to that

12

principle.

13

aliens who are within 100 miles of the border

14

and have been in the country for fewer than 14

15

days.

16

though they were people who just arrived.

17

BIA has issued the decision in Matter of X-K­

18

that -- you know, you can agree with it or

19

disagree with it, but it says for purposes of

20

the bond hearings, we read the regulations to

21

say they have -- they should be treated for

22

bond hearings as though they had been arrested

23

in the interior.

24
25

And you alluded to the category of

For most purposes, those are treated as

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

They are just as much

the people you mentioned at the beginning,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

13
1

those are just as much people who have no right

2

to be in the country, just as much people who

3

haven't been here for more than a few hours,

4

just as much.

5

there's no problem with giving them bail

6

hearings.

7

And yet the agency itself thinks

MR. STEWART:

The BIA has never

8

suggested that aliens who come to the border

9

and are detained at a checkpoint are entitled

10

to what the aliens are given in -- under Matter

11

of X-K-.

12

justification for bootstrapping that ruling.

13

And I don't think there's any

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But the BIA made that

14

distinction because it thought that the

15

regulation prevented other aliens coming to the

16

border from receiving bail hearings.

17

read the statute as not imposing such an

18

obstacle.

19

MR. STEWART:

But it

The -- the statute says

20

with respect to the -- the arriving aliens that

21

these people shall be -- shall be detained for

22

further consideration -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes, and what I'm

24

saying is the BIA read the statute in exactly

25

the way Justice Breyer indicated.

So are you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

14
1

saying that the BIA was simply wrong in X-K-?

2

Because X-K- said the statute doesn't say, the

3

statute is perfectly consistent with bond

4

hearings being given; it's only this

5

regulation, and the regulation only applies at

6

the border.

7

MR. STEWART:

Well, even if you adopt

8

that reading of the statute and even if you

9

accept the decision in X-K- to -- to that

10

extent, the authority under 1226, which is at

11

page 156a of the petition appendix, this deals

12

with people who are detained within the

13

country.

14

subsection (c) of this section, which deals

15

with criminal aliens, and pending the

16

decision -- such decision, namely the decision

17

whether the alien should be removed from the

18

United States, the Attorney General may

19

continue to detain the arrested alien or may

20

release the arrested alien.

21

And it says, except as provided in

And it's the regulations that provide

22

for bond hearings for people who are arrested

23

inside the country.

24

that statute to authorize the executive branch

25

to grant bond hearings for individuals who are

So -- but even if you read

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

15
1

newly arriving at the border, nothing in the

2

statute says that that's compelled and

3

certainly nothing in the Constitution says that

4

that's compelled.

5

And if I could return to it for a

6

second, to your question, Justice Sotomayor,

7

when you asked is there anything comparable in

8

other areas of the law or why would immigration

9

be unique?

I think you -- you can think of the

10

-- the plenary power doctrine, the idea that

11

the political branches have plenary or nearly

12

plenary power to regulate nearly initial

13

admission as simply an idiosyncratic feature of

14

immigration law, but you could also think of it

15

as an immigration application of a more general

16

principle.

17

the government has to provide greater process

18

when it tries to take away something that an

19

individual already has than it would have to

20

provide when it decides whether to give a

21

benefit to an individual in the first place.

22

That is, it's often the case that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what -- some

23

process.

24

with respect to this 1225(a), is no process.

25

Here, what you're saying, at least

MR. STEWART:

Well -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

16
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because you have

2

an executive, a parole IB -- INS member

3

deciding whether someone should be paroled or

4

not, and no neutral magistrate of any kind is

5

looking at that executive decision to ensure

6

it's not arbitrary.

7

fundamental about that in due process, which is

8

someone should be looking at whether this is

9

neutral or not.

10
11

MR. STEWART:

14

Well, somebody is.

I

mean -­

12
13

There's something

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

party.
MR. STEWART:

Some -- but it -- it

15

could certainly be the case as far as the

16

Constitution is concerned that, in many

17

situations, a person who applies for government

18

benefits, for instance, could get the process

19

that -- that Congress specified.

20

specified that an employee of the Social

21

Security Administration would make a decision

22

as to an initial award of benefits and didn't

23

provide -- Congress has provided for judicial

24

review, but if Congress didn't provide for

25

judicial review, I think that the answer as a

2

Process Clause property interest -­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Stewart, is -- is

4

your argument about the new admits, the people

5

who are coming to the border, premised on the

6

idea that they simply have no constitutional

7

rights at all?

8
9

MR. STEWART:

It is premised on that.

Now, we do have the -­

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

If it is

11

premised on that, I mean, Justice Scalia in one

12

of his opinions talked about, surely, that -­

13

that can't be right; could we torture those

14

people, could we put those people into forced

15

labor?

16

that right?

17

Surely, the answer to that is no.

MR. STEWART:

Is

Yeah, I should have been

18

more precise in saying they have no

19

constitutional rights with respect to the

20

determination whether they will be allowed to

21

enter the country.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's an interesting

-JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So -- but they

do have some constitutional rights, not to be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

tortured, not to be placed in hard labor.

2

isn't it -- it pretty close to that, not to be

3

placed in arbitrary confinement, arbitrary

4

detention?

5
6

MR. STEWART:

Why

Because when they arrive

-- I mean, if by "arbitrary" you meant -­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

"Arbitrary" means that

8

nobody gave them an individualized hearing, and

9

so we don't know whether they're being held for

10

any good reason.

11

So, usually, in our -- you know, usually, in

12

our constitutional law, we think that that's a

13

problem.

14

Nobody's made that decision.

MR. STEWART:

Now, I -- I think,

15

Congress, consistent with the Constitution,

16

could have abolished parole altogether and

17

could have said, as a categorical matter, no

18

newly arriving alien will be allowed to enter

19

the country until he or she has persuaded the

20

decision-maker that the right answer ultimately

21

is to let that person in.

scheme under this Court's decisions, but

And it seems

16

to me if I'm right -- and you'll correct me if

17

I'm wrong -- but if I'm right, it's not

18

quite -- I mean, it has a lot of implications

19

because there are a lot of people in that

20

category, and -- and to say they have no rights

21

at all or even no rights, not to be confined

22

arbitrarily, dah-dah-dah, I'm pretty nervous

23

about that.

24
25

MR. STEWART:

Well, again, I tried to

be more precise with Justice Kagan.

It's no

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

21
1

right -- no constitutional right to be admitted

2

into the country.

3

And when the alien simply arrives at

4

the border, the only alternative to release him

5

to the community, subject perhaps to some form

6

of supervision, is detention.

7

also worth pointing out that with respect to

8

these class members, the people who were

9

actually detained for more than six months,

And I think it's

10

fewer than 5 percent ultimately prevailed on

11

the ground that they were not removable; that

12

is, to the extent that mistakes were made at

13

the border as to an actual entitlement -­

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Wait, but I thought

40 percent eventually win, something like that.

16

MR. STEWART:

A number of them win,

17

but on discretionary grounds.

18

asylum or they obtain cancellation of removal,

19

but they don't establish a legal right to be

20

there.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

They obtain

Mr. Stewart -­
Do you agree that

23

detention violates due process, if there's an

24

unreasonable delay in that detention?

25

MR. STEWART:

I would -- if the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

22
1

unreasonable delay is attributable to the

2

government in its prosecutorial capacity.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And how should the

4

Court assess that reasonableness when delays

5

result from backlogs?

6

that Congress has provided only one-tenth of

7

the necessary immigration judges to avoid

8

unreasonable delays.

9

the government?

10

Let's -- let's suppose

Is that attributable to

MR. STEWART:

I would not attribute

11

that to the government.

12

to focus on the two primary categories.

13

And I think I'd like

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So, if immigration

14

judges were not available for a year and a

15

half, that's not an unreasonable delay because

16

we just can't count that?

17

MR. STEWART:

Well, with respect to

18

the arriving aliens, there still is the

19

constitutional rule that they have no due

20

process rights in connection with their initial

21

entry into the country.

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But we -- we -- we

23

started from the premise that you say that

24

there can -- due process is violated when

25

there's an unreasonable delay attributable to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

23
1
2
3

the government.
And my question is going to be how -­
how can we measure that?

4

MR. STEWART:

Well, you're -­

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Isn't -- isn't a

6

bright line rule, six months, nine months,

7

whatever it is, an easier way than to say,

8

well, are there enough immigration judges -­

9

which there aren't -- how -- how can we -- how

10
11

can we measure this?
MR. STEWART:

Well, let me say a

12

couple of things in response to that.

13

first, in your concurring opinion in Demore

14

versus Kim, you said that detention, in that

15

case you were talking specifically about

16

criminal aliens who were detained under

17

1226(c), but you said detention might become

18

unconstitutional if the government was

19

unreasonably prolonging the detention for some

20

purpose unrelated to its original purposes;

21

namely, preventing flight risk and preventing

22

danger to the community.

23

The

And so, for instance, if DHS officials

24

were -- believed that the alien was going to

25

win asylum at the end of the day and wanted to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

24
1

keep him confined for as long as possible, and

2

protracted the proceedings for that purpose,

3

that would establish -- if you could prove

4

that, that would establish a valid

5

constitutional claim under that theory.

6
7
8
9

The other thing I would say about the
various bright line rules that have been -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I could just

push on Justice Kennedy's question a bit, I

10

mean, for those -- that class of aliens, we are

11

talking about people who have been in this

12

country, who clearly do have various

13

constitutional rights.

14

And are you suggesting that if the

15

backlog is five years, it's okay to keep them

16

there for five years without a determination of

17

whether they pose any risk of flight or whether

18

they're dangerous?

19

MR. STEWART:

I would say that is not

20

unconstitutional.

And one of the -- one of the

21

points I would make is -­

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you have to also

23

say under your premise that it's not

24

unreasonable, because I thought you agreed that

25

detention violates due process when there's an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

25
1

unreasonable delay.

2

MR. STEWART:

I would -­

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Now you're saying,

4

oh, well, there's no constitutional right.

5

This doesn't -- this doesn't match.

6

MR. STEWART:

Well, I would say a

7

delay attributable to unreasonable action on

8

the government's part.

9
10
11

And I think with respect to the
criminal aliens -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So five years of

12

backlog or suppose that the government decided

13

to appeal from an adverse decision and that

14

that created a -- a further delay of two or

15

three years.

16

MR. STEWART:

Let me give you my most

17

extreme answer, and then let me give you a -- a

18

backup answer.

19

The most extreme answer is the

20

criminal alien who is detained for more than

21

six months, unlike every other form of

22

detention that are -- is discussed in the

23

briefs, that alien always has the option of

24

terminating the detention by accepting a final

25

order of removal and returning home.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

26
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I take it that that's

2

your most extreme answer because it doesn't

3

sound all that good.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, the -- the -- but

6

the other -- the other -- no, the other nuance

7

to the most extreme answer is Congress, as

8

we've said, has provided certain bases; asylum

9

in some instances; cancellation of removal is a

10

more prevalent form of discretionary relief for

11

aliens who are convicted of criminal offenses

12

and have been confined under 1226(c), Congress

13

had no constitutional obligation to create

14

those discretionary bases on which an alien

15

can -- can try to remain in the country.

16

so Congress -­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

MR. STEWART:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

MR. STEWART:

And

What if we -­
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
Congress could have said

21

all of the aliens who fit within the categories

22

covered by 1226(c) will be removed without

23

regard to discretionary forms of relief because

24

those will be unavailable.

25

And if Congress can take that step, it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

27
1

can also take the step of saying we will give

2

you some hope of discretionary relief, but our

3

resources are thin, and it may take a long time

4

for us to rule on your case.

JUSTICE ALITO:

You -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm just -- just looking at your supplemental

And you say that if the process

10

prompt an occasion for review.

11

MR. STEWART:

12
13
14
15

I mean, it -- it could

be -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- it sounds

close to a concession.
MR. STEWART:

Well, I could be wrong,

16

but I believe we were talking there about the

17

immigration judge stage of the proceedings.

18

And what we were saying was in order to decide

19

whether a case is an outlier, you should look

20

to -- to statistical evidence about how long do

21

particular stages of a case typically take.

22

And if a particular -- if there is an

23

as-applied challenge and the evidence is this

24

particular stage of the case has taken wildly

25

longer than it ordinarily does, that should

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

28
1
2

prompt further inquiry.
But if due to resource constraints or

3

whatever it became typical for proceedings in

4

1226(c) cases to take three years, I think we'd

5

endorse a different principle.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, I think

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I was just going

10

to say if -- let's assume that there is a -­

11

that it would be a constitutional violation if

12

there is unreasonable delay.

13

way to deal with it?

14

What is the best

Is it for us to impose some sort of a

15

time limit, a hard time limit, or would it be

16

better to deal with it the way we deal with

17

Speedy Trial Act -- speedy trial -- not Speedy

18

Trial Act -- constitutional speedy trial claims

19

where you look at -- at all of the factors of a

20

particular case?

21

MR. STEWART:

It would be much better

22

to go the -- the latter route.

23

there are several differences between the case

24

-- this particular setting and the cases in

25

which the Court has adopted bright line rules,

And I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

29
1

but the one that I would focus on most intently

2

is I'm not aware of any situation where the

3

Court has imposed a bright line constitutional

4

deadline where the duration of particular steps

5

was so much within the control of the person

6

who is asserting the constitutional right.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Stewart,

8

individual consideration, like a habeas, if we

9

granted a habeas -- if we say habeas will take

10

care of this, the courts can look at it.

11

are they going to look at?

12

What

I think they're going to look at

13

whether or not you've unreasonably delayed and

14

decide, well, there's a possibility, so let's

15

give this person a bond hearing.

16

The issue here is whether the

17

Constitution sensibly would say give people a

18

bond hearing after a certain amount of time,

19

because then that independent neutral

20

adjudicator can decide whether the reason the

21

alien is being held is that he's a national

22

security risk, he's committed a crime that's so

23

heinous that he shouldn't be let out because

24

he's a danger to the community, or if it's a

25

1226(a) class member who was picked up merely

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

30
1

because they were in a sweep, but there's no

2

criminal record, they have strong ties to the

3

community, they own property, they should be

4

let out.

5

Why would it be sensible to put that

6

person in an individual situation as opposed to

7

creating a rule that says after a certain

8

amount of time, government, explain why this

9

person is dangerous?

10

MR. STEWART:

If the Court thinks the

11

Constitution actually imposes a six- or an

12

eight-month deadline, this case is a perfectly

13

appropriate vehicle to say it.

14

the analysis of whether there is a

15

constitutional violation depends on

16

consideration of a variety of factors,

17

including the extent to which the alien was

18

responsible for the delay.

19
20

If I may, I'd like to reserve the
balance of my time.

25

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

31

2

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

3

I think my friend's presentation

4

clarifies the basic difference between the

5

parties in this case.

6

In their view, as he says, removal and

7

a detention are just two sides of the same

8

coin.

9

provision -- position for both doctrinal and

10
11

And we fundamentally disagree with that

practical reasons.
For doctrinal reasons, it goes far

12

beyond anything this Court has ever said with

13

respect to the power to detain non-citizens.

14

All the way back in Wong Wing, when the Court

15

in 1896 first said that there is a power to

16

detain, they did so in the next sentence by

17

analogizing to the pretrial criminal process.

18

You have the power to detain, but only

19

if the detention is necessary to ensure that

20

the person appears or to prevent, you know, a

21

danger to the community.

22

v. Landon, the height, arguably, of the

23

government's detention power, the Court said we

24

won't impute dangerousness to everybody who's

25

facing deportation proceedings.

Similarly, in Carlson

Instead -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

32

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You -- you

2

mentioned -- you mentioned the pretrial

3

detainee, but there is nothing like a six-month

4

requirement.

5

the remedy that the Ninth Circuit provided a

6

hearing every six months, that is -- is not

7

provided to pretrial detainees.

8
9
10

If somebody is being detained,

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Your Honor, let's

leave the periodic part of that aside for just
a moment.

11

As for the initial six-month hearing,

12

the analogy there is to the -- the bond hearing

13

that you get within days promptly, as the Court

14

said in Salerno, after your arrest in the

15

pretrial detention context.

16

friend's position is correct, Your Honor, that

17

just the fact that you're in deportation

18

proceedings itself is sufficient to justify

19

your detention, then Congress could pass a law

20

that mandated the detention of every person in

21

removal proceedings.

22

And if instead my

And, in fact, my friend said that with

23

respect to, you know, people arriving at the

24

border.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, we -- we know

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

33
1

that Demore said that this was permissible as

2

long as it was for a matter of months.

3

that true?

4

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Isn't

Yes, two things,

5

Your Honor, that it was a brief, and also that

6

the-- the detainee had conceded their

7

deportability.

8
9

And I think both are extremely
important here.

Obviously the detention times

10

here are something like either eight or 10

11

times, depending on who you talk to, more than

12

those in Demore, but, in addition, our class

13

members are detained for a long time because

14

they are pursuing defenses to their cases.

15

And many of them, 40 percent for

16

the -- almost 40 percent for the Mandatory

17

Subclass, two-thirds for the Arrivings, won

18

their cases even when they were detained, you

19

know, and I expect that number to go up.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I agree that

21

there's a significant difference about the

22

time.

23

difference as to that second factor because

24

it's -- I think many of your clients are

25

pursuing cancellation of removal, which I

I guess I'm less sure whether there's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

34
1

believe was the same as in Demore; is that not

2

correct?

3

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

No, it is not, Your

4

Honor.

This is an important point.

5

only relief, as the Court understood the claim

6

in Demore, which was not actually what was true

7

of Mr. Kim, but as the Court decided the case,

8

the only claim he was -- relief he was seeking

9

was withholding of removal.

10

So the

And withholding of removal does not

11

give you a right to remain in the United

12

States.

13

deported to any country, except for one, you

14

know, unless conditions change in that country.

15

It's a form of weaker kind of asylum

16

protection.

You lose your green card and can be

17

In contrast, cancellation of removal,

18

which is half the Mandatory Subclass is

19

eligible for that, if you win that, you keep

20

your green card.

21

And the same is true for adjustment of status,

22

is also true for asylum, for the Arriving

23

Subclass.

24

here.

25

actually, you know, through that case.

You're never ordered removed.

So there's a fundamental difference

Those people get a path to citizenship,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

35
1

And the reason why that matters so

2

much is because the Court treated the

3

concession of deportability as like a proxy for

4

flight risk in Demore and accepted that as a

5

proxy, a categorical generalization because the

6

detention was brief, right?

I'm way over here.

I was hoping you

15

tangles I'm snarled up in.

16

One is 1252(b)(9), which as you'll

17

recall, indicates Congress's intent to strip

18

courts of jurisdiction over final orders of

19

removal, attack -- collateral attacks on them.

20

What do we do about that, in your view?

21

And then also (f)(1), which the Ninth

22

Circuit worked around by saying, in part, it

23

was interpreting the statute, not restraining

24

the statute.

grounds, we would be restraining the statute -­

But if we go down constitutional

-- at least through

a declaratory judgment, which, of course, the

5

much like an injunction.

6

we handle those two problems?

So how do -- how do

7

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

I'd like the

government's view on that too.

10

Yes, Your Honor,

11

(b)(9) unfortunately is not briefed, but the

12

government has said repeatedly that it doesn't

sense because the only time you can challenge

think waived insofar as the Ninth Circuit ruled

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

3

That would be an initial question I guess I'd

4

have.

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

6

be waived, Your Honor.

It doesn't -- it just

7

goes to the remedial power.

8

subject matter jurisdiction.

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

10

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

It doesn't go to

Okay.
And the -- the

11

Ninth Circuit ruled -- recognized that there

12

was a constitutional claim in the case at the

13

time it issued its class certification order.

14

The government argued (f) at that time, and

15

never sought certiorari, but if Your Honor also

16

has concerns about it I would say, you know, it

17

says the Supreme Court has the power.

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Right.
Because it exempts

20

the Supreme Court, and, you know, we're here

21

now.

It's a habeas petition.

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Right.
And it also doesn't

24

mention habeas at all, which was the basis for

25

the Court's jurisdictional ruling in Demore

Heritage Reporting Corporation

38

v. Kim.

And since then actually Congress

2

amended the Real ID Act and they put explicit

3

mentions to habeas in other provisions of 1252,

4

but they didn't do it in (f), so I think

5

there's a, you know, a reasonable statutory

6

argument -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

9

Thank you.
-- to that, Your

Honor.

10

You know, going back, though, to Your

11

Honor's question, Justice Kagan, you know, they

12

viewed deportability, the concession, as a

13

proxy for flight risk.

14

at least as to our group of people who have

15

substantial defenses, is it is a horrible proxy

16

for flight risk.

17

And what we know now,

And, you know, we have people in our

18

case who have citizenship claims -- excuse me,

19

have married U.S. citizens, and they have a

20

petition.

idea that the immigration judge can't just look

at that to individually assess whether or not

like the due process clause should require that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

mean that your proposed remedy, which is a

six-month line, just doesn't fit with Demore,

continued to be detained?

question.

15

So I don't think Demore controls the
I think it is open.
And I think, you know, I think I've

16

sort of given you some of the reasons why I

17

think six months is a logical rule.

18

this Court has never authorized detention

19

without a hearing before a neutral

20

decision-maker, outside of national security,

21

beyond six months.

22

extraordinary to do that.

23

You know,

So I think it would be

Demore certainly didn't say that.

24

Demore said the vast -- the outlier cases for

25

the tiny percent involving appeals will be four

what the Court here obviously does now about

process is structured.

JUSTICE ALITO:

example I can think of, but there, that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

entirely within the power, the control of the

2

-- of the government entity making the arrest.

3

So you arrest somebody, you've got a certain

4

period of time, the 48 days -- the 48 hours.

5

It would have to be short, and the 48 hours is

6

just -- provides clarity.

7

But this is -- this is different.

8

There are many factors that can go into the

9

question of whether the delay is unreasonable.

10
11

Isn't that true?
MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Well, I don't think

12

that -- let me answer two ways, Your Honor.

13

First, Congress previously doubted the

14

constitutionality of detention beyond six

15

months in Zadvydas.

16

useful benchmark for a civil commitment -­

17
18
19

It's also in McNeil a

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, how -- do you

say Congress doubted the constitutionality -­
MR. ARULANANTHAM:

I'm just quoting -­

20

I'm just quoting the Court in Zadvydas.

21

that's it.

22

And

But, Your Honor, the -- the other

23

argument for it really arises from the fact

24

that, you know, when detention becomes

25

prolonged, something is fundamentally

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

44
1

different.

2

somewhere, or else you don't end up with, you

3

know, an administrable rule.

4

what we've seen in the decade of litigation on

5

this subject since Demore is that the lower

6

courts that failed to -- I mean, it didn't even

7

start out that way.

8

said detention was unconstitutional if

9

prolonged, or construed the statute in light of

10
11

So you have to draw a line

And what we -­

The Ninth Circuit first

that, in 2005.
And then there were more cases.

Four

12

and a half years detention, I had a client in

13

2006; seven years detention in

14

Casas-Castrillon, another case that came, I

15

think, another year later.

16

the same thing happened.

17

was unconstitutional or, excuse me, they

18

construed the statute to avoid the

19

constitutional problem, which I know Your Honor

20

is not a huge fan of, but, you know, they did

21

that first, and then four -- four years later,

22

there's been two other cases.

23

The Third Circuit,
They first said it

And so then they start saying we have

24

to have some kind of guidepost.

think the rationale -­

obviously -- concerns are heightened as you get

beyond -- as you extend the time period.

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor.

sense of how I can figure out how often that is

an issue with respect to the broad group of

16

people that are -­

19

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Absolutely, Your

Honor.
If you look at EOIR updated

statistics, so the government's statistics that

they published in FY 2015, which they cite in

is when they -- when they corrected the error

7

outliers.

8

the reason for that is because our class is the

9

people who have substantial defenses.

10
11

So six months, our class, is the
You know, we are the outliers.

And

And it

is true that -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well is that

12

-- but just taking the outliers, the government

13

makes the point that in many cases those

14

individuals are compiling an evidentiary record

15

to substantiate their -- their claims.

16

that should be taken into account in

17

considering how -- how long it is.

18

So that

And I suppose the government's

19

alternative of individualized assessment, which

20

would take into account whether or not the

21

people are using the time to compile a record

22

or not and are particularly interested in

23

getting out now as opposed to in three months

24

or whatever, why doesn't the suitability of

25

individualized -- the availability of

individualized relief through habeas or another

2

procedure become more plausible to the extent

you're dealing with a smaller category of

their claim.

23
24
25

MR. ARULANANTHAM:
Justice.

Right.

Understood,

So let me answer that portion of it.
We fundamentally disagree on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

48
1

question whether you get a hearing to assess

2

whether your detention is lawful or not where

3

the reason for the delay is because you're

4

compiling a record and pursuing relief.

5

I think, you know -- I agree that if

6

you want to give up and go home -- you know,

7

Mr. Rodriguez came here at the age of one, so,

8

you know, I'm not sure where home is, but,

9

anyway -- and, in fact, a huge majority,

10

something like two-thirds of the Mandatory

11

Subclass, came here prior to the age of 21.

12

-- and they have -- 60 percent have U.S.

13

citizen children or spouses.

14

you know, if you want to leave, then you can

15

give up and you control the length of time in

16

your case; true.

17

So

But anyway, if,

But if you want to apply for any

18

relief, or make any defense, you want to

19

contest the charge, anything like that, you do

20

not have control over how long your case will

21

take anymore.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not

23

talking -- I understand -- I understand I think

24

both the government's point and your response

25

about you hold the keys in your pocket and why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

49
1

that's not satisfactory in -- in every case.

2

But my question is that it's -- it's not

3

everybody who is -- the government is not

4

entirely responsible for the length of time

5

that the individual or the individuals are

6

being detained.

7
8
9

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Yes, and, Your

Honor -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- and I'm

10

just trying to get a number.

You say 400

11

people in -- in -- in where?

In the Central

12

District -­

13
14
15
16

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

District of California.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

District of California.

17

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Yes.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the number

19

of people who are not partially responsible for

20

that delay themselves is -- is some smaller

21

percentage of that.

22

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Yeah.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

wondering, as the number gets smaller and

25

smaller, at some point the prospect of

And I'm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

50
1

individual rather than -- individual

2

application rather than unusual class-wide

3

relief becomes a more palatable option.

4

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Understood, Your

5

Honor.

I think if the Court were to hold that

6

you don't even get a hearing, you don't even

7

get to look at your detention, if you are

8

partly responsible for the delay insofar as

9

you're litigating your case, then almost nobody

10

will get out, and you're right that the number

11

of habeas petitions will be very small, you

12

know, assuming that this would be done through

13

individual habeas petitions.

14

But I disagree with the premise

15

because I don't think it's fair to say that you

16

control the length of your detention just -- I

17

mean, you control it in the sense that you

18

could give up, but beyond that, you do not

19

control it.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, control is

21

-- right.

I'm thinking something of the way we

22

approach speedy trial claims.

23

whether or not you've been deprived of a speedy

24

trial, you have to take out of the calculation

25

times when you've asked for a continuance and

In deciding

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

51
1

so on and so forth.

2

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Right.

And that

3

analogy is -- is I think fundamentally

4

misguided, you know, because the Speedy Trial

5

Act gives you release, and it gives you

6

dismissal of the prosecution if, after you do

7

the calculation you describe, you know there

8

has been a violation.

9

people are not detained, right, because the

It applies even if

10

government has a separate obligation to pursue

11

a proceeding in an expeditious manner.

12

There's probably some speedy

13

trial-like constraint also in the immigration

14

context, but we haven't argued that.

15

Process Clause is a separate constraint, which

16

is detention has to be necessary to serve its

17

purpose.

18

The Due

And even if you are litigating your

19

case in good faith, because you're a U.S.

20

citizen's wife or because Mr. Rodriguez has,

21

you know, a baby child at home, he misses the

22

first three years of his child's life, you

23

know, that is because he's pursuing relief.

24

So, in that sense, he is responsible.

25

doesn't make him a flight risk.

But it

You know, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

52
1

so all we're saying is that, for that reason,

2

you should be able to get the hearing on due

3

process grounds, not speedy trial, you get it

4

on due process grounds when the detention has

5

become prolonged.

6

And while the judge may say, you know

7

what, you are pursuing dilatory tactics, you

8

don't have a good faith claim here, or I think

9

you're going to flee, I think even putting an

10

ankle monitor with a GPS device on you is not

11

going to be good enough or you have a horrible

12

criminal history, then that's fine; that person

13

gets detained.

14

that is not true, which is a lot of people in

15

our class, you know, those people should have

16

the chance to -- to make the case in front of

17

the immigration judge.

18

Your Honor -­

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the other people for whom

Well, why do you say

20

-- why do you say it should -- it should happen

21

at six months?

22

immediately?

23

Why shouldn't it happen

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Your Honor, we -­

24

we thought it should happen immediately.

25

Demore v. Kim, we lost.

In

And I think that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

53
1

Court accepted the idea that a categorical

2

generalization, rather than an individualized

3

assessment, was okay for brief detentions as to

4

people who had conceded their deportability.

5

So -- and that's essentially it, you know.

6

If -- if -- that may be fine and you

7

don't need that hearing on day one, but once

8

your case has taken a long time, deprivation of

9

liberty is greater, then you need -­

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what -- does that

11

reflect the idea that there is a significant

12

flight risk in this category of cases?

13

why there's the six-month rule?

14

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

That's

You know -- sorry,

15

you mean the six-month rule from Demore?

16

Congress -- Congress said, and we disagree with

17

this because I think -- the Congress said that

18

there was significant flight risk concerns

19

here.

20

space, you know, but that's -- that's -- that

21

ship has passed, as long as Demore is good law;

22

you know, the -- the Court said, you know,

23

that's a -- that's a sufficient justification.

24

But it didn't foreclose our showing in a case

25

like this.

That was because of their lack of bed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

54
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, building on

2

that, I can imagine some individuals thinking

3

that they have a good argument that they should

4

be released before six months, at some point

5

between zero and six months.

6

Would the class-wide relief preclude

7

those claims and, if not, and we're going to be

8

doing individualized claims anyway for the

9

period of zero to six months, what -- what do

10
11

we gain by creating this bright line rule?
MR. ARULANANTHAM:

We defined the

12

classes that we thought was the outer limit.

13

agree with you.

14

Honor, excuse me -- that there may be people

15

who are entitled to hearings before that.

16

I think there may be -- Your

I don't read this as foreclosing that

17

because, you know, the maximum -- or the sort

18

of most favorable relief we sought was

19

detention -- excuse me -- was -- was hearings

20

at six months.

21

So I think we've foreclosed -- yeah,

22

we've foreclosed the claims we pled but, you

23

know, don't -- don't foreclose, you know, for

24

the -- for the things that we didn't ask for.

25

I

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So we're still going

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

55
1

to have individualized claims between zero and

2

six months and individualized claims, I assume,

3

between six months and 12 months and so forth?

4

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Well, hopefully not

5

the latter if -- if we were to win on six

6

months, but as to the initial -­

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, why not?

If

8

they're detained at six months, but conditions

9

change between six and 12, I would -- I would

10

want to bring a habeas petition at that point.

11
12

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

I under -- I

understand, Your Honor.

13

So first, as to the short, the before

14

six months, as a practical matter, very

15

unlikely because it is impossible to get a

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

How has it worked?

19

I'd assume that the reason six months is not

20

picked out of the air but, rather, six months

21

reflects what's -- reflects Zadvydas, where it

22

wasn't absolutely six months, it was

23

presumptively six months.

24

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
And you could say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

57
1

your continued detention was unreasonable prior

2

to six months, and you could say it was

3

reasonable up to eight months, all those things

4

were true of that case.

5

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

Now, how has that

worked out?

8
9

Right.

I assume that it has worked out that
the problems that had been raised are not

10

overwhelming and, therefore, for purposes of

11

uniformity, which gives the government some

12

time, like many times what it has in an

13

ordinary criminal case, to proceed, and yet

14

doesn't have the extreme detention, that that's

15

where that number comes from.

16
17

So how has that worked out in the
Zadvydas context?

18

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Your Honor, let me

19

answer both that and then just finish answering

20

Justice Gorsuch's question.

21

I think Zadvydas has worked out quite

22

well.

You know, after -- there was one big

23

dispute, which is does it apply to

24

excludeables.

25

Martinez.

That was resolved in Clark v.

You know, I don't -- I'd be

58

surprised if Your Honors have seen a cert

arising out of Zadvydas.

I certainly am not aware of one

You know, in contrast, the Demore

5

rule, you've got our case, you've got Prayopp,

6

which is currently pending before this Court,

7

and there is other -- I mean, there's a lot of

8

litigation that arose from trying to figure out

9

the limits on Demore, unlike Zadvydas.

10

Just to go back briefly, Your Honor,

11

the immigration judge, if they are the one

12

conducting the hearing, it does not take them

13

long to make this assessment.

take about 10 to 15 minutes actually just

because they have the merits case, right.

another look at the hearing -- at the detention

22

after one month -- excuse me -- after one year.

23

It is also a rule of

It ensures that there's

24

sufficient to detain at six months, that -­

25

that's not sufficient to detain after six

59
1

years, which is how long Mr. Rodriguez's case,

2

you know, took to finish.

3

all of his detention for that entire time would

4

have been justified because it's his fault, he

5

is the one who is trying to challenge his

6

claim.

7

And in their view,

And even when he gets to the Ninth

8

Circuit, the government confesses error, and

9

then remands it back, you know, but -- but he's

still the one pursuing relief.

their point was there are discrete periods

18

where they're actually trying to compile a

19

record.

I think

20

They're not suggesting simply because

21

he's seeking relief, they can keep him as long

22

as they want because he can always give up the

23

relief.

24

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

I -- I would hope

25

that is their position, Your Honor.

I guess my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

-- my broader point would still be that the

2

fact that he's pursuing relief, if it's

3

dilatory, that should -- you should not let

4

that person out, and the immigration judge can

5

make that assessment.

6

If it's a plausible claim, a colorable

7

claim, which it obviously was in his case, then

8

he shouldn't have to be locked up.

Would there be any impediment to the

relief you are seeking if we were to remand it

to the Ninth Circuit to take a first view of

the constitutionality?

19

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

I mean, obviously,

20

the Court could do that, certainly.

21

within its power to do that.

22

that's -- but we're continuing to press the

23

construction claim as well, although I haven't

24

discussed it, but, yes, the Court could do

25

that.

It's

I'm not sure if

That being said, the Ninth Circuit I

2

think quite clearly viewed the relief as

3

necessary to vindicate constitutional rights.

It said that at the end of the opinion, that

the purpose of these hearings is to make sure

6

that the detention actually serves its purpose.

So, you know, I can come back for
Number 3 perhaps, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, can I ask

you a practical question?

11

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.
I -- I have seen

13

the statistics that since the Ninth Circuit

14

order, under the 1226(a) category, there have

15

been more people released than previously.

16

Why?

Under 1226(a), you get a bail

17

hearing before an INS judge.

18

the -- on the -- on the immigrant to prove that

19

they're not a flight risk and are not a danger

20

to the community.

21

to have that situation relooked at.

I have two guesses,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so what

is it that has changed the outcome so much?

1

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Right.

So I'm not

2

-- I'm not actually aware of the particular

3

statistics you're referring to, but my two

4

guesses as to why there might be more releases,

5

one is the burden shifts after six months, even

6

for 1226(a) detainees, and they get also a

7

requirement that alternatives to detention be

8

considered under the injunction.

9

exist under regular 1226(a).

10

That didn't

And second, Your Honor, as a practical

11

matter, we know, you can see it in the Metidat

12

declaration, in the Inlander declaration, even

13

people who are eligible under changed

14

circumstances for bond hearings, they don't

15

have lawyers, they don't know that rule.

16

don't read the regulation.

17

have a periodic hearing, the people get the

18

hearing automatically and they're more likely

19

to get access to the Court.

20

--

21

They

JUSTICE BREYER:

Whereas when you

I mean, for sure

What is your answer

22

-- what is your argument on statutory -- I

don't get the statutory part on the second

24

part.

25

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Right.

Your Honor,

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now I can't figure

18

out a way, how do you interpret the statute to

19

get around that even under constitutional

20

components?

21

MR. ARULANANTHAM:

Right, Your Honor.

22

Let me briefly answer that and then turn to

23

Arrivings, because I see that my time is

24

limited and we haven't discussed that yet.

25

We have nothing new to say on the

3

speak in clear terms to authorize a prolonged

4

detention.

5

The two arguments were Your Honors'

We read only if as allowing release

6

even as to brief detentions, and we know that

Act they did clearly authorize detention beyond

with no parentheses.

11

argument.

12

That's -- that's the

14

points.

15

their briefs defended or cited Matter of X-K­

16

as though it was a description of the law.

17

Just three quick

You know, first, my friends twice in

So, on the question whether you do get

18

a bond hearing under 1226(a) if you cross in

19

the desert and shortly after are arrested but

20

then pass the credible fear interview, they -­

21

they -- I thought they had endorsed that.

22

say it in their -- in their brief.

23

He now relies on the regulation.

They

If

24

you look at our opening brief on this question,

25

which is unanswered by the government, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

65
1

problem with the regulation, with relying on

2

the regulation is that the statute, 1226(a),

3

says attorney general in it.

4

And the attorney general cannot then

5

turn around and give that authority to the DHS.

6

If Congress gave it to the attorney general,

7

the attorney general's delegate has to exercise

8

that.

9

Matter of Garcia/Garcia, that the immigration

And that's the BIA's decision in the

10

judges are the attorney general's delegate.

11

that's why they are the ones who have to decide

12

as a statutory matter when someone passes the

13

credible fear interview and are in their full

14

removal proceeding, whether they're entitled to

15

release on bond.

16

So

And the advantage of that -- I mean, I

17

think that's the best reading of the statute,

18

period, even if there's no constitutional

19

problem because, you know, as we discussed last

20

time, Justice Kennedy, there's a neighboring

21

provision for people who are denied credible

22

fear that says you shall be detained pending

23

the removal proceeding.

24

shall be detained for the proceeding, like I'm

25

standing in line for the movie or I'm studying

This one only says

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

66
1

for an exam, you know, that's how we read the

2

provision.

3

And certainly, if you add the

4

constitutional question of whether, if you

5

can't put them to hard labor, as in Wong Wing,

6

and you can't torture or -- or shoot them, you

7

also can't detain them for no reason

8

whatsoever, you know.

9

And the government concedes -- I -- I

10

-- I took my friend to be saying we agree or at

11

least in practice, not as a constitutional

12

matter, but we released the people who are not

13

a danger or flight risk after they have passed

14

a credible fear interview.

15

So then our constitutional dispute is

16

really quite narrow, it's just whether the

17

jailer gets to make that decision, I think

18

you're not a danger or a flight risk, or

19

instead a neutral, the immigration judge, who's

20

got the case, should be the one making the

21

decision.

22

Because we both agree that if they're

23

not a danger or a flight risk and they've

24

passed the credible fear interview, they should

25

get out.

You know, and as we saw, you know,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

67
1

two-thirds of this class, these people who

2

passed the credible fear interview, they win

3

asylum, even when they're detained.

4

that number surely goes up when you get out of

5

-- when you get out of prison, when you're

6

talking about a class of people who have fled

7

horrific persecution in some cases.

8

You know,

And in that situation, we think that

9

it's entirely appropriate for the Court to find

10

that those people have a right to be free from

11

arbitrary detention.

12

we would request the Court affirm the

13

injunction as to the Arrivings, as well as with

14

respect to everybody else.

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

20

MR. STEWART:

21

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

22

I'd like to focus on the criminal

23

aliens, because I think I spent most of my

24

initial time on the arriving aliens.

25

Justice Kagan referred to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

68
1

correction of the statistics that were before

2

the Court in Demore versus Kim, but I think

3

it's important to -- to emphasize that most of

4

what the Court thought to be true at the time

5

of Demore was true; that is, the Court said

6

this detention has a natural stopping point

7

because it lasts only as long as the removal

8

proceedings are ongoing.

That's still true.

9

The Court said the large majority of

10

cases, the IJ's decision is not appealed, and

11

in those cases, the average and median times of

12

detention are about a month, and that was true.

13

The one respect in which the detention

14

times have turned out to be much longer than

15

the Court in Demore thought they were was in

16

the category of cases around 10 to 15 percent

17

where an appeal from the IJ decision is taken

18

to the BIA.

19

But the large majority of those cases

20

are cases involving an alien who loses before

21

the IJ and takes his own appeal.

22

extent that the Court was misinformed about the

23

-- the statistics, it's really in a category of

24

cases where it's the alien's own volitional

25

choice that causes a further stage of the

That's not to say that the alien is at

the same methodology that it uses under the

5

Speedy Trial Clause, the Speedy Trial Act where

6

in determining whether a delay has been undue,

the Court focuses on the reasons for the delay,

8

whether it's attributable to some improper act

by the government.
