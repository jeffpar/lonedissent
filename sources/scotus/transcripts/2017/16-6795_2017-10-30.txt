ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE B. KOVARSKY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. KOVARSKY:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
18 U.S.C. Section 3599 entitles

12

indigent inmates facing the death penalty to

13

reasonably necessary services.

14

are reasonably necessary when they would be

15

used to identify or develop possible claims by

16

a reasonable attorney representing a paying

17

client of ordinary means.

18

And services

But in the Fifth Circuit, the standard

19

is higher.

Inmates must show necessity that is

20

not just reasonable but that is substantial.

21

As a result, courts in the Fifth Circuit, and

22

the Fifth Circuit alone, are permitted to probe

23

deeply into the merits and procedural viability

24

of as yet undeveloped claims that the requested

25

services might support.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why would a

2

reasonable attorney with finite means to spend

3

spend them on -- on the research into the facts

4

as -- as you propose, when he won't be able to

5

submit those facts to the court under

6

2254(e)(2)?

7

MR. KOVARSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, I

8

actually think that they may well be able to

9

submit those facts under 2254(e)(2), and I also

10

think that there are reasons why a reasonable

11

attorney might pursue evidence notwithstanding

12

the inability to introduce that evidence at an

13

(e)(2) hearing to prove the under -- underlying

14

constitutional violation.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, if he is

16

ever able to submit under (e)(2), it would be

17

because it's a new rule of constitutional law

18

-- I'm just looking at the statute here -- or a

19

factual predicate that could not have been

20

previously discovered.

21

have been previously discovered, it seems to me

22

you won't be able to make a case of ineffective

23

assistance of counsel.

24

he couldn't have discovered it.

MR. KOVARSKY:

It's not ineffective if

the (e)(2) analysis because the inmate didn't

clause.

because of the ineffective assistance of

counsel.

7

MR. KOVARSKY:

You think -­

I don't mean to suggest

8

they've heard the issue and decided that it's

9

nonmeritorious.

It's just that the director

10

has made that case to the Fifth Circuit, and

11

that is not the law in the Fifth Circuit.

12

not, you know, the basis of a judgment below.

13

It's not a bar that we'll encounter unless the

14

Fifth Circuit decides to make new law.

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's

Could I ask you a

16

question about the jurisdictional issue that

your adversary has raised?

disputes about the amount of funding?

JUSTICE ALITO:

So any -- any time

3

there's a -- that the attorney is dissatisfied

4

with the amount of funding, I assume, that

5

would mean that there could be an appeal?

6

MR. KOVARSKY:

No, Justice Alito.

If

7

-- for example, if an attorney comes in after

8

the case is concluded and asks for attorneys'

9

fees or something like -- something like that,

10

then maybe there's a discussion to be had about

11

whether that's appealable.

12

asking for resources in the midst of litigating

13

a case or controversy, that's bound up with the

14

case or controversy.

15

But when you're

It's an exercise -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

Well, that's -­

16

that was the situation I had in mind.

17

attorney asks for $20,000 to investigate and

18

the court grants $5,000 to investigate.

19

could be an appeal about that?

20

MR. KOVARSKY:

Yes.

So the

There

If -- I mean, if

21

the determination is based on an evaluation of

22

reasonable necessity.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the

24

statute said that for any requests exceeding

25

$7500, there has to be approval of a circuit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

9

1

court judge?

2

MR. KOVARSKY:

Justice Ginsburg, for

3

any granted amount over $7500, then there has

4

to be a finding that those services are not

5

only reasonably necessary but that they are for

6

an unusual character or duration, and then the

7

chief justice -- excuse me -- the chief judge

8

of the Fifth Circuit or his delegee will review

9

the question of whether it's for an unusual

10

character or a duration.

11

The -- what is not -- the reasonable

12

necessity determination is not reviewed by a

13

judge.

It's reviewed by a court.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, what about -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Here, we're -­

I'm sorry.
We're not talking

18

about how much.

19

whether there is access at all to funds to

investigate.

21

We're just talking about

MR. KOVARSKY:

Yes, I suppose in a

22

situation where an inmate asks for an amount

23

that exceeds $7500, the question might get

24

presented because the chief judge writes it

25

down to $7500.

But that's not this case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

10

1

The basis of the lower court's

2

decision in this case is just that the funds

3

are not reasonably necessary.

4

not reasonably necessary.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

The services are

I mean, one other

6

jurisdictional question.

Is it true that the

7

director of the Administrative Office of the

8

Courts can under some circumstances review a

9

funding grant, and, if that is so, how can the

10

funding grant be the exercise of judicial

11

power?

12

MR. KOVARSKY:

That's not accurate,

13

Justice Alito.

14

the Respondent's brief are cases about the AO's

15

authority under the CJA, not under Section

16

3599.

17

the CJA governs in all non-capital cases and

18

3599 governs in capital cases, and there's no

19

authority in 3599 for the AO to do that.

20

you'll notice that all of the cases that are

21

recited in the Respondent's brief are from the

22

1970s, and that's, of course, because none of

23

those scenarios recited there have anything to

24

do with 3599.

25

The cases that are recited in

Those are distinct statutes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Of course,

And

Looking at the cases,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

11

1

my impression was that if, say, the defendant

2

asked for $15,000 and the court gave $10,000 or

3

maybe $20,000, whatever it is, or one side or

4

the other disagrees with that, they can't

5

appeal.

6

7

appeal.

8

going to lose because the statute is read by

9

various courts, I think correctly, as giving

I mean, they can appeal.

It's like an

Of course, they can

You can always appeal.

But you're

10

very broad discretion to the trial court to

11

decide how much.

12

It's just like they want to call a

13

witness or something.

14

witness is irrelevant.

15

I'm calling him.

16

mandamus or something.

17

because it's up to the -- it's up to the court.

18

And isn't that the same here and shouldn't it

19

be the same?

I mean, you say this
Well, the judge says

You can appeal.

You're going to lose

MR. KOVARSKY:

So, first, I don't -- I

21

think it's true that there is -- that the

22

district courts have enormous discretion to

23

determine the award.

24

I don't necessarily mean

It's just like any

other situation where a trial court has to run

7

areas, and that should be the same here.

8
9

He has broad discretion over many

MR. KOVARSKY:

Yes.

I mean, and, in

fact, that's -- these -- these decisions are

10

reviewable for an abuse of discretion.

11

there's extraordinary latitude in the district

12

court to make these decisions.

13

need to, you know, worry about whether there's

14

a jurisdictional basis because oftentimes what

15

the district court does is going to carry the

16

day.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. KOVARSKY:

19
20

And so

So there's no

Do you -­

Now, if there are -­

I'm sorry.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you believe

21

that the statute can be read to mean that a

22

district court, even if it finds reasonable

23

necessity, that it has the authority not to

24

award fees?

25

MR. KOVARSKY:

I think there are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

13

1

certainly extenuating circumstances where the

2

statute suggests that could happen.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And what would

4

those be and what if a judge exercises that

5

discretion improperly?

6

MR. KOVARSKY:

Okay.

So, before I

7

answer that, I just want to be clear that's not

8

the case that we have here.

9

decided here is reasonable necessity.

10

The case that's

Now -- so, for example, if there's

11

some indication of gamesmanship on the part of

12

federal habeas counsel, the resources are

13

reasonably necessary at this point in the

14

litigation because federal habeas counsel has

15

decided not to pursue them at some earlier

16

point when he or she should have.

17

Or, as in -- as is the case in Texas,

18

sometimes if there's a new claim discovered on

19

federal habeas review and the federal habeas

20

lawyer has to take it back to state court, the

21

state court will pay for that litigation, and

22

so the federal habeas -- sometimes the federal

23

courts will say we're not going to write this

24

check until we know whether the state courts

25

are going to write the check.

So -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

14

1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The things, the

2

examples that you just gave to Sotomayor, is

3

that why you think the word "may" is in the

4

statute?

5

What is it covering and what discretion does it

6

allow?

7

What is the effect of that word?

MR. KOVARSKY:

Those are examples -­

8

"may" is basically an escape hatch that allows

9

a court to decline to award services under

10

extenuating circumstances like the

11

circumstances I just described.

12

The other work that "may" does in the

13

statute is affirm that review is for abuse of

14

discretion, because when "may" is added to the

15

statute, it's denominated as a technical

16

amendment, which means that it is an amendment

17

designed to conform the statute to what

18

existing practice is.

19

And so the idea is just that what the

20

"may" is doing is clarifying what was already

21

happening in the courts of appeal, which is to

22

say that they review for abuse of discretion.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you believe

24

it's appealable but under an abuse of

25

discretion standard?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

15

1

MR. KOVARSKY:

It's appealable on an

2

abuse of discretion standard, but as long as

3

it's bound up with the case or controversy, as

4

long as it's affecting the quality of the

5

representation, then it's appealable.

6

It's not like an order refusing

7

licensure.

It's not like, as mentioned in

8

Respondent's brief, a decision by a judge or

9

justice to hire a clerk.

10

Now maybe the closer question is when

11

an attorney comes in after the case is over on

12

a separate docket number and asks for

13

compensation and a court doesn't want to award

14

that because that decision, the attorney's fee

15

decision after the case is finished, doesn't

16

actually interfere with the representation.

17

So you can make an argument that it's

18

not part of the case or controversy, but as

19

long as the decision under 3599 about resources

20

affects the representation, then it's

21

appealable.

Just -­

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Can we get back to

23

what is the question here?

24

that the district court, as you said in your

25

brief, may satisfy itself that a defendant may

I think you agree

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

16

1

have a plausible claim or defense before

2

granting the funds.

3

So the -- the plausible claim is -- is

4

a standard that a district court can require

5

counsel to meet?

6

MR. KOVARSKY:

This Court has used

7

different formulations for referring to the

8

obligations of federal habeas counsel.

9

McFarland v. Scott, it says that the

In

10

representation is designed to allow counsel to

11

identify and develop possible claims.

12

In McCleskey v. Zant, the way it's

13

characterized is all relevant claims.

14

dissent in McCleskey calls it all conceivable

15

claims.

16

The

I don't necessarily want to get caught

17

up in, you know, is it plausible, is it

18

conceivable, is it relevant.

19

authority uses the phrase "possible claims" and

20

that's from McFarland v. Scott.

21

representation has to be capable of allowing

22

trial counsel to perform that function.

The most on point

The

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what -­

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I would think

25

the most relevant language is the language of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

17

1

the statute, "reasonably necessary."

2

And I really struggled with that, and

3

also with the phrase "substantial need."

4

taking "reasonably necessary," if it just said

5

necessary, that would be a pretty tough

6

standard.

7

But

Would you accept the interpretation of

8

reasonably necessary to mean that this is

9

something that a reasonable attorney would

10
11

think is necessary?
MR. KOVARSKY:

That -- the reasonable

12

attorney standard and a reasonable attorney

13

representing a client of finite means is the

14

standard that we think is appropriate.

15

And it's actually the way they

16

interpreted the word "necessary."

Necessary is

17

the word that appears in the CJA.

And they

18

interpret necessary to mean reasonably

19

necessary under the CJA, and every single court

20

of appeals, with the exception of the D.C.

21

Circuit, which does basically the same thing,

22

interprets "reasonably necessary" to mean a

23

reasonable attorney representing a client of

24

finite means.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the finite means

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

18

1

business is just to make sure that, like a

2

reasonable attorney for Bill Gates, would scour

3

the earth and not care about it.

4

MR. KOVARSKY:

Exactly.

Or, you know,

5

the standard doesn't involve a Richie Rich

6

client or something like that.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.

8

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the -- but the

9

attorney, the reasonable attorney still has to

10

think that it is necessary, which is pretty

11

tough.

12
13

MR. KOVARSKY:

Well, the standard that

Congress -­

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

doesn't mean necessary.

16

MR. KOVARSKY:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Unless necessary

We assume -­

19

that it's really necessary.

We know what

(Laughter.)

2

MR. KOVARSKY:

Well, Congress plucked

3

that phrase directly from the case law that was

4

interpreting the word "necessary" in the CJA.

5

And it's not a particularly close question in

6

the courts of appeal about what the word

7

necessary meant.

8
9

At the time that Congress wrote the
statute, necessary meant reasonably necessary,

10

and reasonably necessary meant the reasonable

11

attorney rule that I described at the top of my

12

opening.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, of course, a court

12

can decide a 3599 motion by reference to a

13

merits or procedural issue.

14

referenced issue can't be intertwined with the

15

evidence that the inmate is seeking in the

16

motion.

17

It's just that the

So take the following example.

A

18

claim has two elements, element A and element

19

B.

20

respect to element A, and the record is not

21

going to get any better with respect to element

22

A.

23

and asks for resources to develop element B.

24
25

And the record is fully developed with

And the inmate comes to court under 3599

A court can decide the 3599 motion by
reference to the merits if what it's doing is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

21

1

saying that your evidence on element A is never

2

going to be good enough and we know that

3

because the record there is fully developed.

4

What the court cannot do and what the

5

Fifth Circuit regularly does under its

6

substantial need rule is say, oh, we're going

7

to guess about what the record on B looks like.

8

We're going to speculate about what you're

9

going to find when you go out and you look for

10

this mitigation evidence or this evidence of

11

materiality, and we're going to -- we're going

12

to guess, based on that estimation, that you're

13

not going to meet that showing on element B.

14

So that's the difference between

15

reasonable necessity, which looks at what a

16

reasonable lawyer would do, and the substantial

17

need rule as operationalized by courts in the

18

Fifth Circuit.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I could -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But when

21

you're -- but when you're talking about

22

facts -- and this is the point you make in your

23

brief -- how do you know that the record is

24

fully developed under issue A?

25

The lawyer can come in and say, well,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

22

1

if we have another investigator and could look

2

further at this, we're going to develop some

3

more facts.

4

that's a valid distinction in your case where

5

it focuses solely on what facts are available.

6

I mean, it -- I'm not sure that

MR. KOVARSKY:

There are certainly

7

some cases where an inmate will be requesting

8

funds to develop both prejudice and deficiency,

9

both prong 2 and prong 1.

10

That is not our case.

In our case,

11

the record for deficiency is fully developed.

12

And it will often be the case that the record

13

on deficiency is fully developed in the motion

14

because the deficiency is the thing that should

15

be evident from trial counsel's files and all

16

the information that federal habeas counsel has

17

available to her.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now, do you think

19

that that includes an attorney -- that's not

20

the facts of your case.

21

your case the defendant himself, to the first

22

investigator who interviewed him, said he had

23

had head traumas and -- and some dependency.

24

And by the time the request for investigative

25

services came about, he had already had a

I -- I know that in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

23

1
2

schizophrenic episode.
But how about a case where there's no

3

evidence whatsoever of dependency and/or of any

4

mental illness, mental challenges, whatever you

5

want to call it?

6

say it is common practice to do this, so I want

7

to do it anyway?

8

suggestion in the record that this is a

9

fruitful inquiry?

10

Can an attorney come in and

Even though there is no

MR. KOVARSKY:

The answer,

11

unfortunately, is it depends.

12

like ours where there's also no social history,

13

something that this Court has said has to be

14

performed in absolutely every single case,

15

then, yes, the attorney can come into federal

16

court and say -- without any evidence of red

17

flags, and they can say look, they just didn't

18

do a social history, that's deficiency, and

19

should be able to get funds to look for what

20

the prejudice from that is.

21

So, in a case

Now, there are other cases, however,

22

where counsel -- where trial counsel might have

23

performed a social history, might have done

24

some mitigation.

25

show up and explain what the deficiency is and

And if trial counsel can't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

24

1

identify what flags -- red flags that trial

2

counsel didn't follow up on, and can't provide

3

a coherent explanation for why they need

4

resources to go look for those flags, then a

5

trial court would be within its discretion to

6

deny the resources.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I have a separate

8

jurisdictional problem that I'm hoping you can

9

help me with and it concerns the COA

10

requirement.

11

but it's jurisdictional, so I'm -- I feel like

12

I should give you a shot at it and you can help

13

me out with it.

14

And neither side discusses it,

The Fifth Circuit didn't require a COA

15

because it read Harbison as saying one wasn't

16

required.

17

one, have distinguished Harbison in similar

18

circumstances, pointing out that Harbison just

19

dealt with the appointment, I believe, of

20

clemency counsel, and the issue wasn't part of

21

the final order in the merits of the habeas

22

petition.

23

But some circuits, including my old

Here, the denial of funding was part

24

of the final order in the denial of a habeas

25

petition.

And as I read 2253, a final order in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

25

1

a habeas proceeding, you need a COA.

2

Now, maybe you can say it's just

3

independent and totally separate from that.

4

But then that might suggest you'd have to -­

5

you'd be able to appeal as a matter of right

6

anytime a funding denial takes place, even

7

before a final judgment.

8

And that seems odd too, though,

9

because funding requests, attorney fee denials,

10

sanctions, usually are wrapped up in and merged

11

with the final judgment.

12

question, but it's jurisdictional, so -- and I

13

thought you could help me out with that.

So, long-winded

14

MR. KOVARSKY:

Sure.

15

So we're appealing the judgment, and

16

the determination on 3599 is part of the

17

judgment.

18

We're not appealing the underlying

19

disposition of the claims because those claims

20

haven't been developed.

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Sure.

But you're

22

appealing the final order in a habeas

23

proceeding, and that's the language in 2253.

24

So help me out with the language in 2253.

25

MR. KOVARSKY:

You know, there are lots of

14

collateral, you know, orders that are issued in

15

habeas proceedings that I -- I don't think are

subject to COA requirements.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -- so it's like a

18

Cohen issue, you'd say, and we have collateral

19

-- you know, it's a collateral issue and so we

20

can take it up before a final judgment in -- in

21

the habeas proceeding?

22

MR. KOVARSKY:

I'm saying it's a

23

collateral order.

I'm not saying it's an

24

exception to the collateral order doctrine in

25

the sense that there's an interlocutory appeal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

from it.

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I've never heard of

3

this animal before.

It's collateral, but it

still merges to the final order?

5

MR. KOVARSKY:

Well, it's -- in the

6

same way that if you denied a hearing without

7

deciding the merits of the claim, I don't

8

necessarily know that that would be subject to

9

the COA requirement.

If I deny discovery in

a case or I deny something that just prevents

25

the claim from even being presented, the -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

28

1

premise behind 2253 is that you can take a

2

rough cut, a first look, at the claim and see

3

if it is -- it has got some merit.

4

why, you know, we have the substantiality

5

requirement and that's why it refers expressly

6

to the merit of the claim.

7

And that's

In situations where you're dealing

with a procedure that prevents you from even

generating that information, the COA

requirement doesn't apply.

JUSTICE BREYER:

correctly, listening to what you've done and it

right.

All

We granted the petition for cert in

19

in using the words "substantially necessary"

20

instead of "reasonably necessary."

21

Well, there are cases in which we have done

22

just that.

on, and then we've said:

Okay.

All right.

Well, picking up on

17

what Justice Breyer just said and trying this

18

one last time, I thought the issue that we had

19

agreed to decide was whether the Fifth

20

Circuit's formulation of "substantial need" is

21

different from "reasonably necessary," which is

22

the statutory standard.

23

And I still don't understand what the

24

difference is between those two formulations.

25

It seems possibly like just a matter of words.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

30

So explain to me what is the

2

difference between those -- those two

3

formulations?

4

MR. KOVARSKY:

The reasonable

5

necessity determination starts -- is a

6

construct that starts with thinking about what

7

a reasonable lawyer would do.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.

Would a

reasonable lawyer think it's necessary?

10

MR. KOVARSKY:

Would a reasonable -­

11

and the -- every evaluation of merit or whether

12

the evidence is helpful for the case starts

13

from the perspective of a reasonable lawyer.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

MR. KOVARSKY:

Right.
The substantial need

16

test has -- wants nothing to do with that

17

concept.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why?

I mean, if you

19

have -- if it's a reasonable attorney -- you

20

know, reasonably necessary, would a reasonable

21

attorney think there was a substantial need for

22

it?

23

MR. KOVARSKY:

A reasonable attorney

24

would -- when a reasonable attorney thinks

25

there's a substantial need for -- as the Fifth

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

31

1

Circuit defines it, then they would, of course,

2

seek the evidence.

3

reasonable attorney will also seek evidence in

4

situations that the Fifth Circuit does not

5

define as a substantial need, such as a

6

situation where it's before -- where it's

7

before the petition has even been filed.

8
9

The problem is that a

JUSTICE ALITO:

It -- it just -- it

seems to me like you're not really arguing the

10

question that we granted.

11

you're saying is that if we take a look at

12

everything that the Fifth Circuit's been doing

13

in this area in lots of cases that are not

14

before us, it's not doing the right thing.

15

That seems to be your argument.

16

really is a difference between these two verbal

17

formulations.

18

MR. KOVARSKY:

You're -- what

Not that there

Justice Alito, I'm

19

going to answer your question then I'd like to

20

reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.

21

What the Fifth Circuit did in our case

22

that it is not supposed to be able to do is

23

speculate about the record on prejudice, which

24

is the claim with two elements that I, you

25

know, that I discussed.

as to what the record is going to look like on

B.

reasonable attorneys don't take a fatalistic

view towards evidence they don't understand yet

everything else in the case.

Where does the defendant go?

MR. KELLER:

The statutory system that

Congress put in place says there's only review

13

when funding has been granted at a level of

14

more than $7500.

15

a private right of action here to go get

federal money under the statute, there is

17

nothing in the statute that evinces that.

If the judge says, nothing, I'm not

place that that can go is to a court of

MR. KELLER:

That's correct.

But

17

whether a district judge is granting or denying

funds, Article III judicial power can't turn on

19

that, that all of a sudden it becomes judicial

20

power when the funds are being denied.

21

If I can turn to the question

presented in the issue of Section 2254(e)(2),

23

it is not going to be reasonably necessary to

pursue any evidence outside the state court

record of trial counsel's performance because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

AEDPA in Section 2254(e)(2) is going to bar

2

that evidence.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the

4

argument that you forfeited -- you forfeited

5

the AEDPA argument by not urging it in the

6

Fifth Circuit?

7

MR. KELLER:

We did not forfeit it.

8

First of all, it answers the question

9

presented.

The Fifth Circuit did not err

10

because this goes to whether it's reasonably

11

necessary, and that is an issue that both sides

12

have been joined on throughout.

13
14
15

And we can't waive arguments.

We can

only waive issues.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, I'm sorry,

16

the Fifth Circuit didn't rely on that ground.

17

Neither have you below.

18

So we reach out to a totally new

19

question in which there's no circuit split and

20

answer that question?

21

MR. KELLER:

Well, this Court, of

22

course, could narrow its analysis and not

23

decide that issue.

it's open after Martinez and Trevino given the

that's a merits issue on the question.

5

having said that, why do we reach it?

6

MR. KELLER:

But

But

The reason that you

7

should reach it here is because, in asking can

8

a circuit do a preliminary merits analysis, it

9

has to account for the limits of habeas review.

10

And if it is the case that (e)(2) is

11

going to bar this evidence, and it does, then

12

there's no reason to continue to fund an

investigation to raise evidence that cannot

MR. KELLER:

The Court, of course, can

in answering the question presented, though,

take account of the fact that there are habeas

limitations inherent here.

is that it seems to me that you can make all of

your arguments under the guise of the test that

the Petitioner proposes, which is, the course,

10

the reasonable attorney working with finite

resources.

I have something of the same problem

that Justice Alito has.

it would be terribly valuable for us to spend

the time trying to figure out is reasonable

necessary; is that the same as substantial need

or not?

18

I -- I don't see that

And even if we come out and say one or

the other, I don't know that it's going to get

20

to the heart of the question, which is what is

exact -- exactly is the district court judge

22

supposed to do or -- so why -- what's wrong

with asking when a reasonable attorney working

MR. KELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice,

there's nothing wrong with that, provided that

the Court does clarify that you could do a

preliminary merits analysis, that you can

account for the underlying nature of the

6

representation, the limits on habeas.

7

Even the Fourth and Sixth Circuits,

8

which purported to create a circuit split with

9

the Fifth Circuit, analyze is this a

10
11

substantial question?

So the circuits are -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If we said taking

12

account of all the circumstances, would a

13

reasonable attorney ask for funds to

investigate?

15

that's the test?

16

That, you think, would be -­

MR. KELLER:

Provided that there would

17

be an analysis, a preliminary analysis, of the

18

merits that accounts for limitations that AEDPA

19

and other doctrines such as Martinez, if it

20

would apply, actually imposes on the

21

representation.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, take this case

23

as an example, right?

So it seems to me if a

24

judge looks at this case, a judge would say:

25

-- look, I don't know what you're going to find

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official

46

1

in your investigation, and it's unreasonable

2

for me to make a judgment about what you're

3

going to find in your investigation because

4

that's the whole point of an investigation.

5

But I do know that here no social history was

6

done at all and you've got like a schizophrenic

7

defendant, somebody who has had a mental health

8

diagnosis of a very serious order.

9

Well, of course, that's the kind of

10

thing that a reasonable attorney would

11

investigate in determining how to spend their

12

limited resources, isn't it?

13

MR. KELLER:

Well, and here, counsel

14

wanted to contact the Petitioner's Honduran

15

family members, but Petitioner himself said:

16

Don't do that.

before trial.

MR. KELLER:

Well, in this case, the

11

was suffering from mental health issues at the

12

time of the incident.

13

Is there -- is it fair to say there

was no deficient performance or a holding on

trying to do things and fails completely, as

Justice Ginsburg points out, to do even the

basics of investigation, trying to get school

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, I can

see -- I have a question about how the two
parts of the statute worked.

11
12

To go back to what

The first says reasonably necessary.
And then there's the "may" question.

13

Now, it would seem to me, I mean, it

14

can work one of two ways.

15

discretion that is granted to the district

16

court could go to the question about whether

17

something is reasonably necessary, the sort of

18

things we've been talking about.

19

In other words, the

I mean, maybe it's necessary if you

20

haven't done anything, but maybe if you're

21

saying, well, I think if I ask the parents a

22

third time, maybe they'd give me a different

23

answer.

24
25

Or is it necessarily a two-step
process where the judge has to make a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

54

1

determination:

2

and, if it is, then the district court judge

3

can still deny it because it says "may"?

4
5

Which of those do you think is how the
statute should be read?

6
7

MR. KELLER:
Chief Justice.

8
9

Is this reasonably necessary,

It's the second, Mr.

And we know that -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I was hoping

you were going to say the first.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

On any grounds?

11

(Laughter.)

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because under

13

the first it does seem to me that all the stuff

14

we've been talking about, you know, did they

15

get the school records or not, did they talk to

16

this person or not, how much did -- it strikes

17

me that those are the sorts of things that

18

would be very hard for a court in the normal -­

19

an appellate court in the normal course to get

20

into.

21

On the other hand, it seems to me

22

there are also things that you could say to the

23

district judge.

24

rulings all the time.

25

familiar than we are with how these sorts of

They do these discretionary
They're much more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

55

1

mitigation investigations are conducted.

2

that if the "may" goes into what's reasonably

3

necessary, it seems to me that makes sense.

4

So

If, however, you say the statute

5

requires an inquiry, is this reasonably

6

necessary, and then the district court has this

7

unusual power to say, even though it meets the

8

statutory standard, I'm not going to do it.

9

MR. KELLER:

Well, let me clarify my

10

answer in -- in this way.

The "may" language,

11

switching from "shall" to "may" does imbue the

12

district court with more discretion, again,

13

assuming that there is jurisdiction.

14

This would be a case sort of like

15

Olano that we cite at page 45 of our brief

16

where there what this Court said is a court can

17

analyze, is this a serious issue?

18

very close to what the Fifth Circuit did here

19

in asking is this a substantial -- is there a

20

substantial need, or the Fourth and Sixth

21

Circuits say is this a substantial question?

22
23
24
25

And that's

And so those would be proper analyses
that a district court could do.
And if I could also address Justice
Gorsuch's question about certificate of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

appealability, because I think this dovetails

-­

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

4

MR. KELLER:

Yeah.

-- with our jurisdiction

5

argument, our position is that this is an

6

administrative act, it is not a judicial act.

7

But if we're wrong about that, and

8

this is actually an appeal from an exercise of

9

judicial power, then a certificate of

10

appealability should be required because then

11

it is an appeal from the federal habeas

12

judgment -­

25

in the first instance.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

reached.

-­

And this is not a situation like

8

good authority where it came up before and they

9

didn't issue a -- COA, but we decided the issue

10

and said now you should have issued a COA too.

11

I may be wrong, but you don't have it in your

12

briefs.

13

don't have it in anything I've looked at yet.

14

But I have it somewhere in the back of my mind,

15

which is sometimes wrong.

They don't have it in their briefs.

So I'll look it up.

pretty reliable, too.

reliable.

But the question -- this is

23

reminding me of something, if I'm perhaps

24

overly simple-minded on this, but what it

reminds me of is the great argument that used

6

there isn't substantial evidence in the record.

7

All right.

You see if, in fact,

You reverse a fact finding of an

That's what the statute does.

That's -- so Jerome P. Frank, who was

closely, I discovered I didn't have that

you agreed, was we look at this case, this is a

19

horrendous murder, the only chance in the world

20

that this defendant has is if he can put on a

21

mitigation -- mitigation case and convince one

22

juror that he shouldn't get the death penalty.

23

There is nothing else, as Justice Kagan pointed

24

out.

25

And if the

But the standard, I thought

MR. KELLER:

limitations on federal habeas?

what are the inherent

4

For instance, if a claim is

5

categorically barred or if the evidence cannot

6

be introduced because 2254(e)(2) bars it, those

7

are all things that an attorney would look at

8

in doing a reasonable, necessary, necessity

9

analysis.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Did we create a

11

meaningless right in Martinez/Trevino?

12

that's what you're arguing, which is it's nice

13

to have a hearing and get past the procedural

14

bar, but all of the things that an effective

15

counsel should have done, and we've now found

16

they weren't, no record has been created.

17

Martinez/Trevino, we said that that was the

18

failing that we were remedying, the fact that a

19

defendant has not been given one clear chance

20

to fully develop a record and make his claim.

21

Is that your suggestion?

MR. KELLER:

No, Martinez will still

Trevino was an

5

MR. KELLER:

Well, and a terrible

8

record.

All of those are on the state court

9

And this Court has already held in

10

Holland versus Jackson and in Williams that

11

attorney negligence is chargeable to the client

12

for purposes of 2254(e)(2).

13

interpretation of the statute.

14

That was an

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But isn't

15

Martinez/Trevino suggesting the very essence of

16

the exception to that rule, which is if you've

17

not been given a chance, a fair chance to have

18

some court decide your claim, then you haven't

19

been represented.

20
21

I don't know what is more attorney
abandonment than that.

22

MR. KELLER:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24
25

Well -­
To have one fair

chance at having a claim reviewed.
MR. KELLER:

Martinez said it was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

62

1

creating a narrow exception.

2

-- it was -- it was clarifying Coleman in that

3

very narrow instance and it was not -­

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It was only over

But, Mr. Keller, this

5

is the language that Martinez used.

6

said that these sorts of claims often require

7

investigative work.

8

again, "they depend on evidence outside the

9

trial record."

10

Martinez

It said, I'm quoting

So the whole exception that Martinez

11

set out, you know, seems to be premised on the

12

idea that there's an opportunity to develop the

13

factual basis for the IAT -- IATC claim.

14

MR. KELLER:

Well, nothing in Martinez

15

or Trevino cited to 2254(e)(2).

16

was only considering the narrow procedural

17

default rules created by the Court, but when

18

Congress has spoken -­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the Court

Well, we said all

20

this.

It often requires investigative work and

21

it depends on evidence outside the trial

22

record, and now you're saying we'll just take a

23

look at this statute and say that of course it

24

doesn't allow investigative work or evidence

25

outside the trial record.

I mean, this is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

63

1
2

precisely what we said.
MR. KELLER:

But when Congress has a

3

statute that directs what the rule is for new

4

evidence, and Congress is raising the bar after

5

the Keeney decision, which was the cause and

6

prejudice standard, that what Martinez said was

7

this ought not put a significant strain on

8

state resources, but this would, in fact,

9

provide huge systemic costs on the system if

10

you're going to open up a trial again and take

11

in any new evidence in a claim of trial IAC

12

which could bring in anything into the record.

13

But that's the 2254(e)(2) issue.

14

The point, though, on the question

15

presented is that those type of considerations

16

are absolutely proper for not only the circuit

17

or the district courts to be analyzing but what

18

a reasonable attorney would take account -­

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

A reasonable attorney

20

with finite means might devote those finite

21

means to an avenue of investigation that has

22

very, very little chance of success because

23

there is so much at stake.

24

So I don't understand how that can be

25

the test here, where the statutory language is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

64

1

reasonably necessary.

2

That seems clearly -- whatever

3

necessary means, it -- it means some degree of

4

importance.

5

be -- has to meet some level of importance in

6

order for the standard to be met.

7

It has -- the evidence has to

I don't see how you can get around it.

8

And to say the test is whether -- what would a

9

reasonable attorney with finite means do, I -­

10

it seems to me quite meaningless.

11

MR. KELLER:

Well, and that's right,

12

Justice Alito, because we're in a habeas

13

context.

14
15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I thought you

agreed with that standard.
MR. KELLER:

Well, because we're in a

17

habeas context, the reasonable necessity

18

analysis has to account for the limits on

19

habeas review.

20

non-habeas cases.

21

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF

7

LEE B. KOVARSKY ON BEHALF

8

OF THE PETITIONER

9

Thank you,

MR. KOVARSKY:

When federal habeas

10

counsel got this case, they looked at the

11

record and they saw that when invested with the

12

momentous responsibility of explaining to a

13

court why the defendant's moral feedback loop

14

was not such that it should impose the death

15

penalty, the sentencing phase, mitigation

16

presentation, lasted two minutes.

17

They also saw that there had been no

18

social history performed.

19

had been no mental health expert that had

20

examined the defendant, and that the trial

21

counsel had failed to follow up on red flags.

22

They saw that there

They saw in the state habeas file that

23

state habeas counsel was told by his

24

investigator nine days after he hired her that

25

the first thing he had to do was a mitigation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

67

1

investigation and a social history, and he

2

didn't do that.

3

And we know that there's a there there

4

because there is a diagnosis of schizophrenia

5

in the record.

6

reasonable attorney, having received this file,

7

getting this case, would do anything other than

8

precisely what federal habeas counsel did in

9

this case.

10

It is inconceivable that a

And the reasonable attorney standard

11

is the right standard because it is the

12

standard that Congress picked.

13

At the time Congress enacted Section

14

3599, it knew that courts had spent 20 years

15

defining reasonable necessity, using a

16

reasonable attorney rule.

17

And it's also the desirable rule

18

because it gives effect to the dominant purpose

19

of the statute, which is to promote parity in

20

representation as between those capable of

21

paying for it and those who aren't.

22

And, finally, it's a really good

23

standard because it's workable.

It's flexible

24

enough to apply across phases of the capital

25

representation, courts have 50 years of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

68

1

experience in dealing with it, and it's got

2

meaningful limits.
