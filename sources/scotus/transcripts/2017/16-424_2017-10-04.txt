ORAL ARGUMENT OF JESSICA R. AMUNSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MS. AMUNSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
A defendant comes to the plea

12

bargaining table with certain rights in hand,

13

including the statutory right to appeal a

14

conviction.

15

The government concedes that in his

16

written plea agreement, Petitioner did not

17

waive his right to appeal his conviction, to

18

challenge the constitutionality of the statute

19

to which he pled guilty.

20

The question here is whether that

21

right is nonetheless forfeited solely by

22

operation of the plea itself.

23

Friendly summarized this Court's

24

Blackledge-Menna doctrine, a defendant who

25

pleads guilty can challenge the -- challenge

But as Judge

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

4
1

his conviction on any constitutional ground

2

that, if asserted before trial, would forever

3

preclude the State from obtaining a valid

4

conviction against him.

5

Petitioner's claim here is that the

6

Second Amendment and Due Process Clause

7

preclude the government from ever obtaining a

8

valid conviction against him.

9

well within the scope of the Blackledge-Menna

10

It thus falls

doctrine.

11

The government's main contention is

12

that Petitioner was required to preserve his

13

claim through a conditional plea, but as the

14

drafters of Rule 11(a)(2) noted in the advisory

15

notes to that -- to that rule, the -- the

16

Supreme Court has held that certain kinds of

17

constitutional objections may be raised after a

18

plea of guilty, Rule 11(a)(2) has no

19

application to such situations and should not

20

be interpreted as either broadening or

21

narrowing the Blackledge-Menna except -- the

22

Blackledge-Menna doctrine or as establishing

23

procedures for its application.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

this, but I don't.

I should know

The -- in the situation in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

5
1

Blackledge, et al., can the government specify

2

that those claims are waived; in other words,

3

spell it out:

4

jeopardy claim too.

5

You are waiving any double

MS. AMUNSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

Both

6

the double jeopardy and prosecutorial

7

vindictiveness claim are waiveable.

8

contention here is not that these claims cannot

9

be waived.

And so our

Our contention here is that they

10

were not explicitly waived in the plea

11

agreement and they were not otherwise forfeited

12

by operation of the plea itself.

13

And I think it's useful to take a step

14

back and look at the categories of rights that

15

are at stake when a defendant pleads guilty.

16

So first are the defendant's trial

17

rights.

18

affirmatively waiving those rights.

19

that they're not going to trial, they're

20

affirmatively waiving the protections -- the -­

21

the -- the very right to a trial and those

22

trial rights themselves.

23

The defendant who's pleading guilty is
By saying

The second class of rights that are at

24

stake are those procedural and evidentiary

25

rights that would go to the reliability of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

6
1

defendant's conviction; so, for example, Fourth

2

Amendment rights against search and seizure or

3

Fifth Amendment rights against

4

self-incrimination.

5

And the Court has held in Tollet and

6

in the Brady trilogy that those rights need not

7

be affirmatively waived but are effectively

8

foreclosed by the plea of guilty, because -­

9

once a defendant pleads guilty, we're no longer

10

worried, for example, about whether the

11

evidence against him was properly obtained.

12

But the third category of rights,

13

which are the rights at stake here, are those

14

which -- where the defendant is saying that the

15

government cannot obtain a valid conviction

16

against me regardless of the procedures that

17

are used, regardless of the evidence that is

18

amassed.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Another situation in

20

which we ask whether the -- a defendant is

21

asserting the right not to be tried is in

22

determining whether there's a right to a -- an

23

interlocutory appeal.

24

a right is one that can be protected through an

25

interlocutory appeal, it would fall within this

So would you say that if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

doctrine?

2

MS. AMUNSON:

3

double jeopardy -- right is -­

4
5
6

It would seem -- so the

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's one that can be

appealed in -- in an interlocutory appeal.
MS. AMUNSON:

Can be appealed.

But -­

7

but we think that the category is broader than

8

that because, for example, the prosecutorial

9

vindictiveness claim is not something that can

10
11

be appealed through interlocutory appeal.
JUSTICE ALITO:

How about a speech or

12

debate clause claim?

13

interlocutory appeal.

14

Congress is charged with a crime and pleads

15

guilty, that member of Congress may then argue

16

on appeal that the prosecution was blocked by

17

the speech or debate clause.

18

MS. AMUNSON:

That's -- that permits an
So, if a member of

If -- if the speech or

19

debate clause would forever preclude the

20

government from obtaining a -- a conviction

21

against him, yes.

22

require that defendant to otherwise contradict

23

the admissions that he makes in pleading

24

guilty, so that's the other important

25

limitation on this right.

If -- if it would not

And then the -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But wouldn't that

2

be the same for statute of limitations?

3

think that statute of limitations has been

4

considered to come within 11(a).

5

-- if you don't raise it, you can't raise it

6

later, even though you're saying the statute of

7

limitations ran before I was charged with this

8

crime; so I shouldn't be subjected to -- to

9

prosecution.

10

MS. AMUNSON:

And I

If you don't

Yes, Your Honor.

I

11

think it's -- it's hard to conceive of a

12

statute of limitations situation that would not

13

require the defendant to -- to contradict the

14

admissions, the factual admissions, that he

15

makes in pleading guilty.

16

would likely be encompassed within the Tollett

17

and Brady line of cases that are effectively

18

foreclosed by the -- by the plea of guilty.

19
20
21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So we think those

What about the

unconstitutional composition of a grand jury?
MS. AMUNSON:

That is -- that is

22

exactly the Tollett case, Your Honor, where the

23

Court held that that was, in fact, foreclosed

24

by -- by the guilty plea.

25

that category of rights are the category of

So -- so what -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

9
1

procedural and evidentiary protections that a

2

defendant would otherwise be entitled to if he

3

went to trial but, in fact, are foreclosed once

4

the defendant pleads guilty.

5

And this -- the Blackledge-Menna

6

category is an entirely separate category,

7

where the defendant is saying, regardless of

8

the procedures that are used, regardless of the

9

evidence that is amassed, I cannot be validly

10

convicted of this crime.

11
12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But what

about -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So there is a

14

limit to your -- your definition of what this

15

doctrine would hold.

not clear on the face of the admission?

18

MS. AMUNSON:

You're saying if it's not

That's right, Your

19

Honor.

If -- if the constitutional violation

20

is not clear on the face of the record at the

21

time of pleading guilty, and that's the

22

formulation that this Court used in Justice

Kennedy's opinion for the Court in Broce, where

24

the Court said that this category of rights is

to the standard charge, which would be the

crime was committed on 1991, a substantive

10

crime and continuing conspiracy crime.

11

Defendant pleads guilty and says, yes, I did

12

the substantive crime in '91 and I participated

13

in the conspiracy.

14

says.

15

And that's all he or she

Why would not this be subject to the

16

Blackledge line of cases, the Menna-Blackledge

17

line of cases?

18

Or would it be?

MS. AMUNSON:

Would the -- I'm sorry,

19

Your Honor.

20

saying that that was unconstitutional on

21

appeal?

22

So would the defendant then be

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yes.

Well, that

23

-- that there -- a statute of limitations has

24

run.

25

MS. AMUNSON:

Oh.

So because, Your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

11
1

Honor, I think that the -- the defendant would

2

have, in making the plea, had to admit certain

3

facts that would be -- that the defendant would

4

then have to be contradicting on appeal.

5

And so we're accepting the limitations

6

that it has to be on the record at the time of

7

pleading guilty.

8

back and saying, no, actually, those are not

9

the facts and, in fact, I -- there was a

10
11

The defendant would be coming

continuing conspiracy and -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or there wasn't a

12

continuing conspiracy, but how about the

13

substantive crime, the charge is in -- is in

14

2017, but -- on the indictment was in 2017, but

15

the charge, the substantive charge was 1991

16

with a five-year statute of limitations.

17

MS. AMUNSON:

So if -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could that

19

defendant come back and say, yes, I did that

20

crime then?

21

MS. AMUNSON:

So, Your Honor, I think

22

that is conceivable that that could fall within

23

the Blackledge-Menna line of cases, but the

24

Blackledge-Menna line of cases has generally

25

been held to be constitutional limitations on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

the -- on the ability of the Court to secure

2

conviction.

3
4

Blackledge and Menna themselves were
both about constitutional limitations.

5

And, of course, the Court need not

6

decide the outer bounds of the doctrine here

7

because all that we are arguing for is the

8

constitutionality of the statute of conviction,

9

which we think falls well within the Blackledge

10

-Menna doctrine.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

except those that once raised cannot be cured.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

4 because it was left out.

8
9
10
11

You have a crime.

The -- the defendant pleads guilty to the

Is that something that can be raised
on appeal or is that covered by his guilty
plea?
MS. AMUNSON:

Well, I think because

12

the defendant is pleading to a substantive

13

crime, as this Court defined it in Broce, that

14

the defendant would not be able to raise that

15

on appeal because the defendant is saying, in

16

fact, I -- I did this substantive crime.

17

So I met these elements of this crime

18

as defined by the -- by the legislature.

19

the defendant would then be trying to come back

20

on appeal and contradict the admissions that he

21

made in pleading guilty.

22
23
24
25

So

And that would not be permissible
under the Tollett and Brady category of cases.
So the -- the Menna and Blackledge
line of cases is analytically distinct and it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

14
1

follows in many ways the -- the line that this

2

Court has drawn in its retroactivity

3

jurisprudence of the line between substantive

4

and procedural rules.

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just -- just to be

6

clear as to your theory of the case.

Suppose a

7

state passes a statute that a guilty plea

8

waives any later right to challenge the

9

constitutionality of the state statute, the

10

federal constitutionality of the state statute,

11

and the defendant is fully advised of this, and

12

he enters the plea.

14

invalid.

17

MS. AMUNSON:

No, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. AMUNSON:

We're not claiming that

20

this is a constitutional rule binding on the

21

states.

22
23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's my

understanding.
MS. AMUNSON:

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Okay.

So -- so if

5

argument if it's not constitutional?

If it's -- what is the

substantive basis -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Just the best

interpretation of Rule 11?

10

MS. AMUNSON:

11

best interpretation of Rule 11.

12

we just have to take a step back for a moment

13

and look at what each party is coming to a plea

14

bargain with ex-ante.

15

Well, it's not only the
It's also that

So the defendant comes with certain

16

statutory rights, including a right to directly

17

appeal his conviction.

18

to him unless it is affirmatively waived or

19

somehow foreclosed.

20

And that right belongs

And, so here we know, the government

21

concedes, it's not affirmatively waived in his

22

written plea agreement.

23

look to whether it's somehow foreclosed.

24
25

So we have to then

We look to Rule 11.

Rule 11 says, no,

where you have a Blackledge-Menna claim, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

16
1

don't have to preserve it by way of a

2

conditional plea.

3

does not dispute that there is an exception to

4

Rule 11 in the Blackledge-Menna doctrine.

5

dispute only whether a constitutional challenge

6

to the statute of conviction falls within that

7

exception.

8
9

So the -- the government

They

And I think their attempts to
distinguish Blackledge and Menna fall short

10

because they cannot explain Blackledge and

11

Menna themselves.

12

Court's other relevant precedents.

13

simply unworkable.

They cannot explain the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And they're

Is the Court -­
What is your

18

conviction under it, comprehends all factual

19

and legal elements necessary to sustain a

20

binding final judgment."

21
22
23

And I'll quote the words:

MS. AMUNSON:

"A plea, and

Yes, Your Honor.

I

think that that is correct.
But if the Court also reads through to

24

the end of that paragraph, the Court will see

25

there are exceptions where on the face of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

17
1

record the Court had no power to enter the

2

conviction or impose the sentence.

3

So, we agree that a defendant's plea

4

does, indeed, encompass the factual and legal

5

elements to sustain the conviction to say, yes,

6

I -- I committed this crime as defined by the

7

legislature.

8
9

But as the Court recognized in Broce,
which is -- which comes after the passage of

10

Rule 11, there are exceptions where on the face

And the Court had no

power to enter the conviction here because?

16

MS. AMUNSON:

The Petitioner's claim

17

is that the Second Amendment and the due

18

process clause preclude the Court from ever

19

obtaining a valid conviction against it.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But you just said

21

that if a state had this law, it -- it would be

22

valid.

I don't -­

state would have that power?

understand it.

4

MS. AMUNSON:

I don't

I thought Your -- Your

5

Honor's hypothetical was that the state could

6

pass a law saying that a guilty plea forecloses

7

a later challenge.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

MS. AMUNSON:

Yes.

So we are not contending

10

that this right is not waiveable.

11

saying it was not waived here -­

17

Why is that, if there's no constitutional

18

prohibition against it?

19

MS. AMUNSON:

So I think the -- the

20

use of the word "power" and "jurisdiction" have

21

been somewhat -- construed somewhat more

22

broadly than they might otherwise be thought

23

of, Your Honor.

one that it somehow got away they will write

out specifically.

3
4

Is that right?

MS. AMUNSON:
Honor.

5

That's correct.

That's correct, Your

JUSTICE ALITO:

And, Your Honor -­
Is the question -- I'm

6

sorry.

7

implicitly concede by pleading guilty?

8
9
10

Is the question what does the defendant

MS. AMUNSON:

That's the question,

Your Honor, yes.
JUSTICE ALITO:

And so you can

11

understand Blackledge and Menna to say the

12

defendant does not implicitly concede that my

13

conviction is not barred by double jeopardy,

14

for example, but you could understand the plea

15

to implicitly concede I'm guilty of the offense

16

for which I'm charged.

17

facts and law as set out in -- in the case we

18

were discussing.

And that would include

19

Now, if that is the proper

20

understanding of Blackledge and Menna, where

21

does your case stand?

22

MS. AMUNSON:

Because if the defendant

23

is saying I am guilty of the offense as

24

charged, but the Constitution precludes my

25

conviction because of the double jeopardy

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

22
1

clause, because of the due process clause, or

2

because of, here, the Second Amendment and the

3

due process clause, that is the category of

4

Blackledge and Menna claims.

5

So the -- it is where, on the face of

6

the record, the court had, as the formulation

7

is in Broce, no power to enter the conviction

8

or impose the sentence.

9

think of it might also be the formulation that

But the easier way to

10

Judge Friendly used of things that are not

11

curable.

12
13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MS. AMUNSON:

That's correct, Your

Honor.

16
17

No power only

because it was not expressly waived?

14
15

So -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

That's the only

reason?

18

MS. AMUNSON:

Right.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So all we're talking

20

about is what -- how Rule 11 is properly

21

interpreted and how this plea agreement is

22

properly interpreted?

23

MS. AMUNSON:

Right.

We're

24

essentially talking about a federal forfeiture

25

rule that where -- and here, as I've said, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

23
1

government concedes that the plea agreement

2

does not explicitly waive the defendant's right

3

to appeal his conviction and challenge the

4

constitutionality of the sentence.

5

So the only question is whether by

6

operation of the plea itself, something is

7

waived.

8

question and say, no, that there is a category

9

of cases that are not waived by -- a category

10
11

And Blackledge and Menna answer that

of claims that are not waived by -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

But the no power

12

formulation doesn't seem to be very helpful for

13

the reasons that are pointed out by -- by

14

Justice Kennedy's question, because if it can

15

be waived, then there's power to do it.

16

MS. AMUNSON:

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18
19

Right.

So I think -­

So it has to be

reformulated, I think, in another way.
MS. AMUNSON:

So where -- where the -­

20

the -- whereas the formulation in Judge

21

Friendly's opinion, where it would forever

22

preclude the State from obtaining a valid

23

conviction against him, and that would be the

24

double jeopardy clause -­

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it doesn't

MS. AMUNSON:

Well, where the claim is

3

that if I -- where the claim -- this is

basically what is reserved.

5

Tollett line of cases say you don't have to

6

affirmatively waive everything.

7

actually implicitly concede some things, and

8

those are your procedural and evidentiary

9

objections like Fourth Amendment or Fifth

But you can still reserve after a plea

12

of guilty a class of claims that would go to

13

whether the Constitution would bar your

14

conviction.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. Amunson, would you

16

tell me if your theory is different than or the

17

same as the following theory?

18

at this is just to say that a plea substitutes

19

for a trial and a verdict at that trial.

20

the line that we should be drawing is any issue

21

that would have been decided at trial is

22

foreclosed, unless there is -- you know, unless

23

there's been an explicit statement in the plea

24

agreement, and any other is not foreclosed.

25

One way to look

So

Is -- is -- is that the right line or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

25
1

are you drawing a different line?

2

why?

And, if so,

3

MS. AMUNSON:

4

generally the line, Your Honor.

5

that also what -- a defendant might at trial

6

also raise a motion to dismiss their indictment

7

on constitutional grounds and lose that motion

8

and then try to renew that motion on appeal.

9

And that's essentially what Defendant here is

10

I -- I think that's
I would stress

also doing.

11

The Defendant, just like the defendant

12

in Menna, just like the defendant in this

13

Court's decision in Haynes, moved to dismiss

14

his indictment on constitutional grounds, lost

15

that motion, and then pled guilty and is now

16

trying to renew his constitutional challenge on

17

appeal.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

And I don't understand

19

that -- your answer to that.

20

conviction after trial permits -- if a

21

defendant's conviction after -- after a

22

trial -- convicted after a trial, the defendant

23

can -- can raise on appeal any issue that was

24

preserved.

25

MS. AMUNSON:

At trial, a

That's right, Your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

26
1

Honor, but I took Justice Kagan's question to

2

be is this about the sort of procedural and

3

evidentiary rules that you would have had to

4

overcome at trial, a motion to suppress, a -- a

5

contention that your confession was coerced.

6

Things like that that would be decided at trial

7

when the evidence is coming in against you,

8

those are foreclosed.

9

But things that are sort of beyond

10

what would be decided at trial are independent

11

of any kind of procedural or -- or evidentiary

12

ruling that might be made at trial are still

13

preserved.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So you're saying -­

15

you're saying this rule is congruent with the

16

plain error rule?

17

MS. AMUNSON:

I think -- well, Your

18

Honor, we're not contending that there's -­

19

that you don't have to preserve this issue.

20

the -- the defendant here, as I said, just like

21

in Menna and in Haynes, actually preserved his

22

constitutional objections by raising a motion

23

to dismiss his -­

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If he hadn't, there

would be a different result?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

27
1

MS. AMUNSON:

If he hadn't, I think

2

there would be plain error on -- on appeal.

3

So -­

4

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what about a

5

-- a question of statutory interpretation?

6

Suppose the defendant, after a guilty plea,

7

says, you know, this statute cannot be

8

interpreted to cover my conduct.

9

MS. AMUNSON:

Right.

So, Your Honor,

10

I will just say, in the lower courts, this

11

doctrine has largely been limited to

12

constitutional challenge to statutes.

Under -- under your

view, why should there be a difference?

MS. AMUNSON:

to impose a conviction because the statute,

19

properly interpreted, doesn't cover my conduct.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

that you propose us to -- that you would

MS. AMUNSON:

So I think that that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

28
1

could be encompassed within the

2

Blackledge-Menna doctrine.

3

indicated earlier to Justice Sotomayor, you may

4

well also say that the Blackledge-Menna

5

doctrine is about constitutional bars on the -­

6

the conviction.

7

However, as I

And in the -- the situation that Your

8

Honor is raising, the constitutional bar is one

9

step removed.

So, in the Blackledge and Menna

10

cases and in the case that we have here, the

11

defendant is saying:

12

provision prohibits my conviction.

13

defendant is -- it's one step removed where the

think the premise underlying your response to

Justice Kagan was a guilty plea waives a trial.

6

It doesn't necessarily waive other legal claims

7

that might exist outside of trial.

8

might be one, that the statute should be

interpreted differently.

Blackledge and Menna in a vacuum, but it's

I think what the drafters of Rule

19

had done in those particular situations and

20

instructed that the rule should not be

22

in those cases, which they described with some

23

specificity.

24

Blackledge and Menna as the tip of an iceberg

25

for the kind of rule Petitioner is proposing,

They weren't quite sure what to
They respected what this Court

which would, in theory, allow every criminal

defendant in the system who pleads guilty, and

3

there are over 50,000 of them each year, in

4

theory, to raise a substantive challenge to

5

their conviction without having notified the

6

government or the court of their intent to do

7

so.

8
9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, all you have to

do -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Feigin, it's

11

awfully hard to say that the floodgates are

12

opening when it's in the power of every U.S.

13

Attorney to just write this into the plea

14

agreement.

15

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, if the

16

Court were to say that in its opinion and make

17

that very clear, I think that would go a long

18

way towards resolving a lot of the problems the

19

Petitioner's rule would otherwise create.

20

But let me say a few things about

21

appeal waivers.

Under current law, we have a

22

couple of difficulties with appeal waivers.

23

One is that some District Judges believe that

24

they have discretion not to accept a plea

25

agreement that includes an appeal waiver, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

33
1

so, as a practical matter, we can't get appeal

2

waivers in those districts.

3

Number 2 is that several courts of

4

appeals have created implicit exceptions to

5

appeal waivers and some of which -- some of

6

them apply when a defendant is challenging

7

substantively the statute under which he is

8

convicted.

9

those -- in those circuits.

10

And so we can't get it enforced in

And even circuits that would otherwise

11

dismiss the appeal, nevertheless, require the

12

government to brief the issue on the merits.

13

So we don't get the benefit -- we don't

14

actually get the practical benefit of the

15

appeal waiver.

16
17
18

The other thing I'd say about appeal
waivers -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Feigin, all

19

you're saying is how much power you have and

20

how much power to coerce you have.

21

The other side is simply saying if a

22

defendant wants to accept your power, let him

23

do so expressly.

24

courts are doing separately, but that shouldn't

25

bind him or her to the whim of whether you will

You can worry about what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

34
1

let them plead guilty based on an appeal waiver

2

that's so broad that they can't challenge

3

anything that's a constitutional violation.

4

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, I think the

5

considerations of what the default rules should

6

be are the considerations that the drafters of

7

Rule 11(a)(2) took into account in the policy

8

process that produced that rule.

9

And they produced a broad rule that

10

applies not only to claims like the ones we

11

have in this case but to all the kinds of

12

claims that a defendant might want to bring

13

after pleading guilty, Fourth Amendment claims,

14

Fifth Amendment claims.

15

They concluded that the proper way to

16

preserve those claims was to make clear to the

17

government and to the Court ahead of time that

18

that was going to be something that was

19

reserved in the defendant's plea.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -- and clear to

21

the defendant what he is giving up.

22

this case, in the plea colloquy, the Court

23

informed Mr. Class you can appeal a conviction

24

after a guilty plea if you believe that your

25

guilty plea was somehow unlawful.

And in

And the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

35
1

defendant expressed some uncertainty about what

2

that meant.

3

But isn't that exactly what this

4

defendant is doing?

5

plea was unlawful because the statute under

6

which I was charged is constitutionally flawed.

7

It cannot be a crime.

8
9
10
11

MR. FEIGIN:

I believe that my guilty

Well, Your Honor, a

factual response to that and then a legal
response.
The factual response is that if you

12

read the remainder of the sentence, which is on

13

Joint Appendix 63, the Court says if you

14

believe your plea was somehow unlawful or

15

involuntary or if there is some other

16

fundamental defect in these guilty plea

17

proceedings, I think it's properly understood

18

to go to the kinds of procedural claims that

19

everyone understands you can bring after a

20

guilty plea, such as that your plea was not

21

knowing and intelligent.

22

The Court again -- and this is on page

23

76 -- tells the defendant that the plea

24

agreement actually precludes him from

25

challenging his conviction on appeal, which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

36
1

isn't correct, but if he thought he had wanted

2

to actually bring an appeal challenging his

3

conviction, he might have spoken up at that

4

point.

5

But the broader legal point is that

6

this Court has made clear any number of times

7

that a defendant need not be subjectively aware

8

of everything that he is giving up in a plea in

9

order for the plea to be a knowing and

10

intelligent waiver of those rights.

11

21

Ginsburg's question.

22

point.

23

That is also correct,

I was simply responding to Justice
I want to make one last

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Let me -- let me

24

put a case to you that seems to be strongly for

25

the other side, and it is Loving against

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

37
1
2

Virginia.
There are two people who pled guilty

3

to violating Virginia's miscegenation statute,

4

pled guilty, didn't reserve anything out.

5

that plea did not block them from seeking to

6

vacate their convictions on the ground that the

7

statute under which they were convicted was

8

unconstitutional.

9
10

MR. FEIGIN:

Yet,

So, Your Honor -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that just a slip

11

that the Court didn't notice that they had pled

12

guilty and, therefore, shouldn't be able to

13

raise the constitutional question?

14

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, that

15

case, as the caption reflects, came up through

16

the state courts.

17

quite clear that states can craft their own

18

procedures in these circumstances.

19

no one raised it in Loving against Virginia.

20

I think this Court's been

And clearly

And whatever state procedures they may

21

have had wouldn't -- apparently did not

22

preclude the claim.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But this was a case

24

where this Court, notwithstanding any state

25

procedures, and I don't think there was any

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

38
1

state procedure that says -- said that they -­

2

that their plea reserved out this question.

3

It was this Court that said they could

4

raise the question of the unconstitutionality

5

of the statute under which they were convicted,

6

not a state court.

7

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't

8

believe this particular preclusion question was

9

directly addressed in the circumstances of

10

Loving.

11

if that case came up through the federal system

12

in Rule -- under Rule 11(a)(2) today.

13

And let me explain what would happen

First of all, the Lovings could seek

14

to enter a conditional plea, and the government

15

frequently does agree to conditional pleas,

16

although different U.S. Attorney's Offices have

17

different policies.

18

If the government for some reason did

19

not agree to a conditional plea, the defendants

20

could seek to have some kind of stipulated

21

bench trial, and they agree to the facts, yes,

22

we're married to each other, and they would

23

preserve every single possible claim they could

24

bring after a trial.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And In some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

39
1

jurisdictions, the Judges use that to deny an

2

acceptance of responsibility.

3

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, that is

4

specifically addressed in the Sentencing

5

Guidelines and the commentary to 3E1.1.

6

says that a Judge may give the acceptance of

7

responsibility reduction to a defendant who

8

insists on a trial solely for the purpose

9

precisely of preserving a challenge to the

10
11

And it

statute.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And "may" -- "may"

12

doesn't "should."

And "may" is discretionary,

13

because the sentencing reduction is

14

discretionary.

15

offices who routinely tell Judges if a

16

defendant seeks to preserve an appeal right,

17

they have not accepted responsibility.

And I know of many prosecutors'

18

And many Judges, just like many Judges

19

won't accept the appeal waiver for that reason,

20

don't give the acceptance of responsibility.

21

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

22

the points that you're raising are the kinds of

23

things that are best considered through the

24

kind of process that produced Rule 11(a)(2).

25

And I think if we're going to decide that there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

is going to be a particular exception to Rule

2

11(a)(2) to -- a particular class of claims -­

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Feigin, can I

4

go to your basic 11, Rule 11 argument?

5

what Rule 11 does, if you just look at the text

6

of Rule 11, it says here are the conditions in

7

which you can enter a conditional guilty plea,

8

you know, you have to get some consents, and

9

then you can enter a conditional guilty plea.

10

Because

It doesn't say what happens if you

11

don't do that.

12

says and the consequence of not entering a

13

conditional guilty plea is X, Y, Z.

14

There's nothing in Rule 11 that

So you have to look outside the rule

15

for the consequence of not entering a

16

conditional guilty plea.

17

that the place you look, the question you ask

18

is, well, what's the inherent effect of that

19

guilty plea?

And it seems to me

20

So Rule 11 just tells you, you know,

21

go try to figure out what the inherent effect

22

of the guilty plea is, and what's covered by

23

it, and, on the other hand, what's not.

24
25

So I don't see how Rule 11 really is
the answer to this question.

Rule 11 just sets

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

41

up the problem.

2

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, I think everyone

3

agrees, Your Honor, and Petitioner hasn't

4

contested there's a negative implication baked

5

into Rule 11.

6

I think the first place I would look

7

is the Advisory Committee notes which make

8

clear that the drafters of the rule enacted it

9

on the understanding that a traditional

10

unconditional plea of guilty operates as a

11

waiver of all non-jurisdictional claims.

12

there's no dispute that this is a

13

non-jurisdictional claim.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

except for the Black -- Blackledge-Menna

16

doctrine.

17

MR. FEIGIN:

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And

Except for -­

So, Your Honor -­
And it's, you

19

know, it's obvious the key word is doctrine.

20

It suggests to me that there's more covered by

21

that than just Blackledge and Menna -­

22

MR. FEIGIN:

I'm not sure that's

23

right, Your Honor.

I think, first of all, the

24

drafters of the rule were quite well aware of

25

the issue that's before the Court here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And I

Official

42
1

think it says something that they did not

2

actually identify it as one of the exceptions.

3

I think they looked at Blackledge and

4

Menna and sort of took them as they were and

5

didn't want to interfere with the work that

6

this Court was doing.

7

But I don't think there's any reason

8

to believe that they silently intended to

9

create another exception for the kinds of

10

claims at issue in this case.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's a -- there's

12

logic.

13

brought this out before.

14

that if the government wants to make the

15

defendant waive his constitutional claims, you

16

said they simply write into the plea agreement.

17

I mean, it's logical.

Justice Kagan

I'll assume with you

And maybe there's some you can't, I

18

don't know of any you couldn't, but there might

19

be, then that's a different case.

20

assume that you could do that, and here somehow

21

you forgot to do it.

22

don't forget, but here you forgot.

23

So I'll

In a lot of cases, you
Okay.

So then we have to face the problem of

24

whether, by saying guilty, that's a waiver.

25

And I thought, having looked at Blackledge and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

43
1

Menna, the rule is simply this:

2

guilty, you have admitted you did what the

3

statute forbids.

4

When you say

Okay?

So let's go look at the statute.

See

5

what it forbids.

And you admit you did it.

6

Now, that means you're waiving all the claims

7

that the evidence wasn't good enough, that they

8

should have excluded something under the Fifth

9

Amendment, that somebody shouldn't have

10

testified under the -- the Fourth Amendment,

11

under the Fifth.

12

things -- a jury trial.

13

you did what the statute forbids.

14

There are a whole lot of
Naturally, you admit

But what you haven't admitted is that

15

the statute, for example, is a valid statute.

16

You haven't admitted that.

17

you haven't admitted, you haven't admitted

18

vindictive prosecution because I did it, I did

19

it, but they're prosecuting me for a bad

20

reason, and they can't do that.

21

vindictive.

22

And another thing

Okay?

That's

Two, you didn't admit double jeopardy.

23

I did it, I did it.

Ha, ha, you still can't

24

prosecute me because you did once before.

25

did it, I did it, but you cannot take away from

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official

44
1

me the right to claim that the statute's

2

unconstitutional because my guilty plea has

3

nothing to do with that.

4

So, when we fall into that category,

5

the guilty plea by itself doesn't waive the

6

claim.

7

moreover, where it's important, like

8

Constitution.

9

last part.

10
11
12

Now, all we have to say here is, and,

But I don't know if you need the

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, let me be -­

let me respond to that in a couple of ways.
First of all -- and this goes to

13

Justice Kagan's proposed rule that she advanced

14

to opposing counsel.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it doesn't

16

quite work, her rule, because the rule doesn't

17

take into account, which I hadn't thought of -­

18

I thought it -- it doesn't take into account

19

failures in the indictment.

20

failure in the indictment, you couldn't bring

21

up later because what you've admitted to is you

22

did what the statute forbids.

23

MR. FEIGIN:

And -- and a

Well, Your Honor, it does

24

even more than that because, for example, it's

25

clear, under Tollett against Henderson, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

45
1

can't challenge the composition of the grand

2

jury, but if you went to trial, you would have

3

a right to challenge the composition of the

4

grand jury even following conviction.

5

the Court said in Baskett v. Hillary.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

In fact,

It doesn't matter,

7

because when you say you did it, you are

8

admitting that you did what the statute forbids

9

and they can convict you for it.

Okay?

You're

10

admitting you did what the statute forbids, so

11

you can't -- you can't challenge the

12

composition of a grand jury; of course not.

13

You can't challenge any of the stuff that would

14

take away that you did the things that the

15

statute forbids.

16

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, the

17

grand jury is somewhat unrelated to that

18

factual admission of guilt, but let me -- let

19

me add a couple more points.

20

you're exactly right, you are admitting that

21

you can be convicted for it.

22

clear in Broce, just as it was clear in Brady,

23

just as it was clear in Alabama against Boykin,

24

just as it was clear in Florida against Nixon,

25

that that admits legal guilt as well as factual

First of all,

And the Court was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

46
1
2

guilt.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, that can't be

3

right because, after all, if you're admitting

4

that they can convict you and put you in prison

5

for it, we wouldn't have Blackledge and Menna,

6

because in Blackledge and Menna, they admitted

7

they did what the statute forbids, but still

8

they could claim that it's double jeopardy or

9

vindictive prosecution.

10

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, let me give

11

you one -- yet one more counterexample aside

12

from Tollett, and then let me please address

13

Blackledge against Menna and why I don't think

14

they stand for what you say.

15

actually the closest analogue we have to this

16

case is Brady against United States, which,

17

unlike Blackledge and Menna, was a challenge to

18

the act of the legislature, not the act of

19

bringing the prosecution.

20

But I think

In Brady against United States, you

21

had a statute where a defendant was only

22

exposed to the death penalty if the jury

23

recommended the death penalty.

24

held in Brady, as explained by Tollett, that

25

once a defendant pleads guilty, he cannot claim

And the Court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

47
1

that his conviction is invalid because of

2

the -- a structural defect in that statute,

3

that structural defect being that it

4

unconstitutionally burdened his right to choose

5

a jury trial.

6

his factual guilt.

7

That has nothing to do with

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Mr. Feigin -­

8

Mr. Feigin, on that, I -- I look to history to

9

start with.

And -- and Justice Harlan in

10

Haynes suggested otherwise, that you could

11

challenge the constitutionality of the statute.

12

And he cited a Second Circuit case, and we

13

traced it back and it goes all the way back to

14

1869 and Justice Ames in Massachusetts,

15

indicating quite clearly almost exactly what

16

Justice Breyer just -- he might have channeled

17

his inner Justice Ames there.

18

suggesting that not only is it -- you're not

19

admitting even to what the statute says; you're

20

admitting to what's in the indictment.

21

And it's

Isn't that maybe the most natural and

22

historically consistent understanding of what a

guilty plea is?

MR. FEIGIN:

5

And that's particularly

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, what do I do

6

about the Haynes and -- and this 150 years of

7

history?

8
9

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I think

that would be a better argument if this case

10

came before the Court in 1982 before the

11

enactment of Rule 11(a)(2).

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, putting aside

13

Rule 11, because I have some of the same

14

difficulties that haven't been addressed yet as

15

Justice Kagan expressed, but just -- just

16

understanding of what a guilty plea means.

17

MR. FEIGIN:

So, Your Honor, I don't

18

think Haynes goes to what a guilty -- I don't

19

think Haynes reflects this Court's

20

consideration of what a guilty plea means,

21

first of all, because Haynes was unconnected

22

from -­

23
24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Justice Harlan

didn't mean what he wrote?
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

49
1

wasn't disputed in that case.

2

had briefed it.

3

stands for the proposition that -- and we don't

4

say otherwise -- that this isn't a

5

jurisdictional rule; that is, it's more in the

6

nature of a mandatory claims processing rule.

7

If the government doesn't raise it, then the

8

defendant can proceed -- can proceed to bring

9

the claim.

10

Neither party

I think, at most, Haynes

But I think a guilty plea inherently

11

acquiesces to judgment and conviction being

12

entered against you and to the imposition of a

13

sentence because that's directly what a court

14

goes and does following a guilty plea.

15

could give an -­

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

If I

Well, but -- well,

17

but if I plead guilty, I'm -- I'm admitting the

18

facts and I'm admitting the elements that are

19

charged in the complaint or the indictment.

20

And it would follow that a court could enter a

21

judgment, absent some other bar, I would think,

22

but I don't necessarily see how that precludes

23

even a motion to dismiss the indictment under

24

statutory grounds.

25

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, again, Your Honor,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

50
1

I'd go back to the statement in Broce that I

2

believe Justice Ginsburg read earlier, that

3

this Court has said, more recently than Haynes,

4

that a guilty plea encompasses all the factual

5

and legal admissions necessary for the entry of

6

conviction and the imposition of a sentence.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but that could

8

just mean that the defendant admits all -- that

9

all the elements of the crime are established,

10

all the factual and legal elements of the

11

crime, not that the crime then becomes

12

insulated from constitutional challenge.

13

MR. FEIGIN:

We know it means more

14

than that because we know that from Tollett and

15

we know that from Brady.

16

real concrete example of why I think their rule

17

would be quite impractical.

18

But let me give a

Consider a circumstance in which the

19

government charges someone with, say,

20

distribution of child pornography, and during

21

the pendency of those proceedings, the

22

defendant engages in witness tampering.

23

there's a plea agreement in which the

24

government and the defendant agree that the

25

defendant will plead guilty to the child

not to bring the witness-tampering charges.

the part of the defendant that he wants to

preserve some right to appeal.

6

turns right around after sentence is imposed,

7

and he challenges the constitutionality of the

8

child pornography statute, say, on First

Amendment grounds.

And then he

At that point, the government -­

unless this Court is going to make clear that

appeal waivers would be enforceable in those

circumstances, the government has already lost

the benefit of its plea agreement, depending on

how the appellate proceedings go and what might

16

happen if some -- if the government loses and

entirely clear that the government could

We'll leave that for

2

has gotten much more focused on appeal, to the

point where it might have been useful had the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there wasn't

He said I admit all the

facts that I was charged with, but you can't

12

prosecute me for this because I have a Second

13

Amendment right to bear arms.

14

MR. FEIGIN:

Yeah, Your Honor, he

15

raised the Second Amendment, and he's now

16

challenging whether the statute under which he

17

was convicted is constitutional as applied.

18

It wasn't even clear in district

19

court, it was an as-applied challenge.

some of the arguments he makes on appeal about

the necessity of protecting the Capitol Grounds

are things we could have submitted evidence on.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In -­

Official

56
1

in -- in a bunch of different cases, Bailey

2

being one of them, the government relied in

3

many where we found things retroactive, the

4

government has relied on plea waivers.

5

most circuits have thrown out those cases by a

6

defendant.

7

MR. FEIGIN:

And

Well, Your Honor, we

8

would not seek to enforce, and I'm not aware of

9

courts enforcing waivers, for example,

collateral relief waivers in circumstances

11

where this Court has held a statute to be

unconstitutional.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

which you've done that across -- maybe not you

16

17

Attorneys across the country have.

There are cases in

there are particular -- particular cases bear

currently litigation about the effect of this

24

Court's decision in Johnson against United

25

States.

So, for example, there is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

57
1

And in some cases, we've resisted the

2

application of particular defendants because we

3

don't think they're really making Johnson

4

claims, they're trying to use Johnson to make

5

claims that are actually statutory and are

6

barred.

7

enforce the appeal -- the collateral attack

8

waivers, and we've been somewhat successful.

9

But in the -- I just want to get to

the second reason I think this is a good

prospect of succeeding on appeal.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Can I -- can I -- can

2

I ask, Mr. Feigin, how the rule that you are

3

espousing fits with the language that we've

4

used in Blackledge and Menna and Broce?

5

Because when I look at those cases, the

6

language that we use seems totally consistent

7

with the theory that Justice Gorsuch and

8

Justice Breyer raised, and not consistent with

9

yours.

10

So when they were talking about what

11

-- what -- what's not precluded by a guilty

12

plea, they say, well, where you have a right

13

not to be hailed into court at all, they say

14

where the charge is one that the state cannot

15

constitutionally prosecute; that last one is

16

from Menna, and they say where the court had no

17

power to enter the conviction; that last one is

18

from Broce.

19

So, in all three of those cases, the

20

language used is where, you know, in the end

21

you find that the -- that you've -- you've -­

22

you've done the facts, you've satisfied the

23

elements, but still the state can't prosecute

24

you constitutionally or properly.

25

And that's exactly what fits with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

59
1

Justice Gorsuch's and Justice Breyer's theory.

2

Three -- three times we've said it.

3

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, let me say a couple

4

of things.

5

think, as the colloquy with opposing counsel

6

demonstrates, that does not produce a clear

7

rule, and a clear rule is important in these

8

circumstances.

9

First of all, I don't think -- I

Second, I don't even think the author

10

of Blackledge, Justice Stewart, viewed his

11

opinion that way, and I think that's clear if

12

you look at the dissent, he joined in Ellis

13

against Dyson.

14

And, third, I don't think anything

15

that this Court said in Blackledge and Menna

16

reflects that they're really the tip of the

17

iceberg that would allow claims by all sorts of

18

defendants.

19

In those cases, you had the court

20

outside the context of any sort of conditional

21

plea procedure asking whether there's any

22

recourse for a defendant who wanted on the one

23

hand to plead guilty and on the other hand to

24

preserve a claim that he was charged under -­

25

he was charged for primary conduct for which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

60

he'd already been charged and convicted.

2

the court allowed a defendant to do that and

3

preserve those claims, but as the Brady example

4

illustrates, it's treated legislative claims

5

differently.

6

And

There's one more important point I'd

7

really like to make, which is that I believe I

8

heard opposing counsel to say that under their

9

rule, as they interpret Blackledge and Menna,

10

which, again, I think the contours of which are

11

not clear, and I would caution this Court we

12

really do need rules in this area.

13

rule, the error has to be clear on the face of

14

the indictment.

15

Under their

I think if the Court looks at the face

16

of the indictment in this case, the Court is

17

not going to find anything that relates to the

18

as-applied Second Amendment challenge.

19

The claim simply says that Petitioner

20

possessed weapons on Capitol Grounds, full

21

stop, and the as-applied nature of the claim is

22

that the -- it relates to exactly where the

23

defendant was and what he saw and that sort of

24

thing.

25

And I don't really understand how that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

1

claim could properly be preserved under their

2

rule.

3

government would win this case.

4

The other -­

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So even under their rule, I think the

I thought he was

6

saying now, he may be totally wrong on the law,

7

but saying that a statute that says I can't

8

bring guns on the Capitol Grounds is

9

unconstitutional, period.

10
11

Why is it as

applied?
MR. FEIGIN:

He has framed his claim

12

as an as-applied claim, where he claims it

13

infringes on the rights of a law-abiding

14

citizen as applied to him because he was in a

15

parking lot.

16

If you look at his Court of Appeals

17

brief, or the amicus brief in the Court of

18

Appeals that he's adopted, he makes much out of

19

exactly where he was and the fact that he

20

possessed weapons only in his car.

21

I want to make one more point about

22

appeal waivers, to get back to Justice Kagan's

23

question earlier, which is I wouldn't want to

24

sit down without informing the Court that there

25

are -- 25 percent of the pleas in the federal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

62
1

system don't even involve plea agreements.

2

They're open pleas.

3

And when a defendant enters a plea

4

without an agreement and the district court and

5

the government have every expectation that that

6

ends the case, the defendant should not be able

7

silently to reserve a challenge to the

8

substance of the conviction that the defendant

9

assented to the court entering.

10
11

If the court

-­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

What do you mean an open plea?

13

MR. FEIGIN:

-- I'm sorry.

We call them open pleas.

14

It's just a term for a plea without a plea

15

agreement.

16

plead guilty himself so the -- without a plea

17

agreement.

18

responsibility points for that.

19

So the defendant simply decides to

He gets acceptance of

And in those circumstances, the

20

government and the district court have every

21

reason to believe that the case is over, so

22

long as the plea was knowing and voluntary.

23
24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
given him that.

Why?

You haven't

You think it's in the plea.

MR. FEIGIN:

Because that's in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

63
1

nature of the plea.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

The -- the

3

nature of a plea shouldn't be to automatically

4

say you've lost all rights because you pled

5

guilty.

6

today.

7

That's basically what your position is

MR. FEIGIN:

May I answer, Your Honor?

8

Your Honor, you don't lose all rights.

9

is a procedure -­

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There

To -- to the

appeal.

12

MR. FEIGIN:

-- that was draft -- that

13

was crafted for entering a conditional plea.

14

And if a defendant does not believe that a case

15

is ended by his plea, he should -- it's

16

incumbent upon him to tell the district court

17

and tell the government that that's what he

18

means when he pleads.

REBUTTAL ORAL ARGUMENT OF JESSICA R. AMUNSON

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

25

MS. AMUNSON:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

64
1

I'll begin with Mr. -- one of Mr. Feigin's last

2

points, which was whether the error must be

3

clear on the face of the indictment.

4

fact, the claim must be clear on the face of

5

the record at the time of pleading guilty, and

6

that is clear from this Court's opinion in

7

Broce.

And, in

8

And then if I can just address quickly

9

the Rule 11 claim that the government is making

10

here about the drafters of Rule 11.

11

Chief Justice pointed out, those drafters used

12

the term "doctrine."

13

As the

And the Court need look no further

14

than Judge Friendly's opinion, which is

15

essentially contemporaneous with the enactment

16

of the 1983 amendments to Rule 11 establishing

17

the conditional plea procedures to look to the

18

definition of that doctrine.

19

That doctrine is also explained in the

20

sources that are cited in the Rule 11 advisory

21

notes.

22

time to include constitutional challenges to

23

the statute of conviction as it was enacted

24

against the background of Haynes, as Justice

25

Gorsuch pointed out, where the Court considered

And that doctrine was understood at the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

65
1

it obvious, so obvious that it put it in a

2

footnote that, of course, a defendant's guilty

3

plea did not preclude his later constitutional

4

challenge.

5

Briefly, just to address the colloquy,

6

I just want to point out that the colloquy

7

cannot waive the defendant's rights because it

8

is, first of all, a third-party that the

9

defendant would be effectively contracting with

10

when there is no plea waiver or no appeal

11

waiver in his plea agreement.

12

And that the plea agreement itself has

13

an integration clause, which says that it

14

comprises the totality of the agreement between

15

the government and that anything further will

16

be entered into in writing.

17

Finally, as to Mr. Feigin's point

18

about the potential information imbalance and

19

the government not getting the information that

20

it needs in pleading guilty, as this Court has

21

recognized, it takes practicalities into -­

22

into account.

23

And here, if there's any imbalance, it

24

is on the defendant.

The defendant enters the

25

plea bargaining process with certain rights.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

66
1

One of those is a statutory right to appeal.

2

And if the government wants the

3

defendant to waive that right, the government

4

should ask for an explicit waiver of that right

5

in its plea agreement.

6

The government did not do so here.

7

And we ask the Court to reverse the judgment

8

below and allow Petitioner's claims to proceed

9

on the merits in the Court of Appeals.

10

Thank you, Your Honors.
