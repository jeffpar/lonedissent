CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

argument first this morning in Case 16-1362,

5

Encino Motorcars versus Navarro.

6

Mr. Clement.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Service advisors are salespeople

12

primarily engaged in servicing automobiles.

13

Service advisors are plainly salespeople, and

14

what they sell and what they are primarily

15

engaged in is the servicing of automobiles.

16

Thus, Respondents and the nation's

17

100,000 service advisors come within the

18

literal disjunctive text of the FLSA exemption

19

for any salesman, partsman, or mechanic

20

primarily engaged in selling or servicing

21

automobiles, trucks, or farm implements.

22

That is -­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is -- is there any

24

other category that -- the statute lists three

25

categories:

Salesmen, partsmen, and mechanics.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
4
1

And you say the service advisor is -­

2

should fit under salesmen.

3

person that's not specifically enumerated

4

that's subsumed under one of these categories?

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Is there any other

There -- there is,

6

Justice Ginsburg, if what you mean is sort of

7

an occupation that was well understood at the

8

time that Congress passed this exemption in

9

1966.

The example would be automobile body

10

repairmen.

11

category, for example, in the Occupational

12

Outlook Handbook that my friends on the other

13

side like so much, but yet the -- the Labor

14

Department has consistently treated repairmen

15

in the body shop as covered by the exemption,

16

just like mechanics in the service shop.

17

It was treated as a separate

So I think that goes a long way to

18

showing that it's not like Congress was

19

consulting this handbook at all or had this

20

conception that it was going with a

21

three-to-three correspondence with existing

22

occupations and what it was trying to capture

23

in the statute.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Clement -­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
5
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- you said the

2

literal meaning.

3

arguments, but I have to tell you I don't think

4

that that's the best one of them.

5

And you have some good

Just if you think of what servicing

6

means -- this is one dictionary, but basically

7

all dictionaries say the same thing -- it means

8

to perform services of maintenance, supply,

9

repair, installation -- as to service a car.

10

So it actually means to do the work,

11

to do the repair, to do the maintenance -- I

12

think would be the most ordinary understanding

13

of what servicing means.

14

So it does seem as though, for all the

15

arguments that you do have, that one cuts

16

against you, that, you know, just the ordinary

17

meaning of what it means to be engaged in

18

servicing automobiles is to be repairing,

19

maintaining, fixing cars.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Your Honor, I

21

mean, I'd love to talk to you about some of the

22

other arguments you seem to like better, but

23

let me try to push back a little bit on this

24

one, which is I'm the -- be the first to admit

25

that servicing in some statutes can have a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
6
1

relatively narrow compass and includes only,

2

you know, essentially turning the wrenches

3

yourself.

4

But in other contexts, it can have a

5

broader meaning, supplying the service,

6

providing the service.

7

Congress used the term in that latter, broader

8

sense, because of the inclusion of partsmen,

9

because partsmen are not engaged in getting

10

And here we know that

under the hood and turning the wrenches.

11

The best place to look at what a

12

partsman does is the Labor Department

13

regulation that's been on the books since 1970.

14

It specifically talks about what a partsman is

15

primarily engaged in, and that is the

16

requisitioning, stocking, and dispensing of

17

parts.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So I -- that is one of

19

the better arguments, I think, is what -- what

20

"partsman" is doing in this, but I think I'm

21

still suggesting, before we get on to that,

22

that if you took partsman out of this statute,

23

I don't really think that you'd have a leg to

24

stand on here, that we would just naturally

25

mean, well, servicing automobiles is like

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
7
1

fixing them.

2

And what -- and the service providers,

3

they have something to do with servicing, to be

4

sure, but they're not doing the servicing.

5

What they're doing is selling service products.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Your Honor, I

7

think if "partsman" were not in the statute, I

8

would have a weaker argument.

9

might have a leg to stand on, especially if

I think I still

10

there were four decades of industry reliance on

11

a position.

12

But I do think that the partsman can't

13

be ignored and I do think it's actually a

14

mistake to sort of look at servicing in

15

isolation from the inclusion of partsmen in the

16

statute because -­

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if we look -­

18

if we look, Mr. Clement, at how partsmen got in

19

there, I mean, there is the legislative history

20

that Senator Bayh said the partsmen are woken

21

up at 4 in the morning because some piece of

22

farm equipment needs to be repaired.

23

there was somebody else who backed that up.

24

those senators at least thought of the partsman

25

as somebody who would work irregular hours.

And then

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

Official
8
1

Now, they may not have -- they may

2

have been talking about a specific category of

3

partsmen, the ones -- ones who attend to farm

4

equipment, but they use -- the statute uses the

5

general title.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it does more than

7

use the general title, Justice Ginsburg.

8

also -- I think there's no argument that the

9

statute only covers farm implement partsmen.

10

It

Based on its disjunctive structure, it

11

certainly covers, I think, automobile partsmen

12

and partsmen at a truck dealership.

13

think equally importantly, it covers it without

14

regard to whether they work outside or have

15

unusual hours.

16

And I

And so I think what you have here is a

17

classic example of where Congress was impelled

18

to include partsmen in the statute based on

19

some very specific concerns of specific

20

senators about farm dealer partsmen, but then

21

they expanded the statute quite a bit more

22

substantially to cover all of the partsmen.

23

One other just footnote on that piece

24

of the legislative action, I think it's

25

actually interesting that when Congress first

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
9
1

proposed adding partsmen, they proposed adding

2

partsmen who were selling or servicing farm

3

implements.

4

And so I think what that shows is that

5

Congress may have actually had with selling or

6

servicing not necessarily two siloed,

7

disjunctive terms but sort of the broader

8

process of selling or servicing, because I

9

don't think partsmen ever sold the farm

10
11

implements themselves.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

One of the amicus

12

briefs talks about what partsmen did

13

historically and makes the case that what

14

partsmen did when this statute was passed is a

15

little bit different from what -- or a lot

16

different from what a partsman does now, in the

17

sense that when this statute was passed, there

18

were not readily available, ready-made,

19

off-the-shelf parts.

20

did was kind of get under the hood and try to

21

strip engines and play with the parts and

22

adjust parts.

23

more part of the repair process than somebody

24

who was taking things off the shelf.

25

And what partsmen really

And, you know, it was very much

MR. CLEMENT:

Justice Kagan, I know

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
10
1

there's an amicus brief that says that.

I

2

think -- you know, we're here to ask you to

3

mostly look at the plain text of the statute,

4

but if you're interested in looking at

5

something, I do think that occupational

6

handbook from 1966 has a couple of pages about

7

what partsmen did back then, and I don't think

8

it really maps up with what the -- the amicus

9

brief says, which is to say, even back in 1966,

10

sure, there might be an occasion on which they

11

had to fix some part or got under the hood, but

12

in the main, what they did then is exactly what

13

the Labor Department identified, which is

14

they're behind the counter, they're making sure

15

that when you do a repair and you need a new

16

spark plug or a new fan belt, that they

17

actually have it in stock.

18

And that is, I think, classically what

19

a partsman does.

I don't think that it really

20

puts them really in the same place as the

21

mechanics.

22

want to look at those photos at the back of the

23

red brief that come from that occupational

24

handbook, I think it's telling that the service

25

advisor and the mechanic are the two photos

I mean, it's interesting, if you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
11
1

where the hood's up.

2

the partsman, he's behind the counter, which,

3

you know, I don't mean to say that's where he

4

or she belongs, but that is where they

5

typically are, and it's pretty far removed from

6

the action, which is why I think the partsmen

7

really are the clue to interpreting this

8

statute to have this broader compass of

9

services.

10

The -- the counterman,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So can I try a

11

hypothetical on you?

12

statute is designed to match this one in

13

structure and -- and -- and to present the same

14

question.

15

salesman, designer, or seamstress primarily

16

engaged in selling or making dresses.

17

right?

18

And the hypothetical

So here's the language:

Any

All

So there we -- we know the seamstress

19

is involved in making dresses.

We know the

20

salesman is involved in selling dresses.

21

designer is the partsman.

22

look, the designers, they're not actually

23

sitting there with the needle, but they're

24

still sort of making the dresses.

25

partsman.

The

And you could say,

That's the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
12
1

And then the question is, would you

2

really say that the salesman is making the

3

dresses too?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

I'm not sure I would,

5

Your Honor, but I think there are reasons for

6

that, which is I think making dresses is a

7

narrower term, frankly, than servicing.

8

think servicing is a broader term.

9

I

I also think that designers are,

10

frankly, more integral to the making of the

11

dresses than the partsman is to any kind of

12

narrow concession of services -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is exactly why

14

I've -- I was interested.

15

primarily relying on literally.

16

You say you're

Well, I think in 10 minutes the two of

17

us could think of hundreds of examples maybe,

18

or at least 50, where just, look, any

19

seamstress or customer who makes or wears

20

dresses.

21

Hey, they don't mean the seamstress

22

who wears dresses.

They mean the customer who

23

wears dresses and the seamstress makes the

24

dresses.

25

or learns at this university, they don't mean

Any professor or student who teaches

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
13
1

the professor who learns at the university.

2

They mean the professor who teaches and the

3

student who learns.

4

Any salesman who -- what's the word,

5

you know, sells or -- sells cars or -- we -­

6

you see the -- but I think there's so many

7

examples like that, that that seems to be the

8

natural meaning.

9

that are verbs, two words over here that are

You have two words over here

10

nouns.

The first seems to go with the first,

11

the second with the second.

12

And if I just gave you this and you

13

knew nothing else about it and you were just

14

looking at the literal words, I would have

15

thought on a bet you would have said that's the

16

interpretation.

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Breyer,

18

there's a couple of things.

19

examples that you are suggesting, I think, have

20

a two-to-two correspondence -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Most of the

Yeah.

-- not a three-to-two

23

correspondence.

24

big difference in the real world.

25

And I do think that makes a

The second thing is I do think, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
14
1

mean, I'm not here to tell you that there

2

aren't disjunctive series followed by

3

disjunctive series where you do have matching.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. CLEMENT:

Yeah.

Now, I think often

6

that's because the matching really excludes the

7

other cases or produces a null set.

8

also depends a little bit on sort of what's

9

going on.

10

I think it

With your professor and student

11

hypothetical, if you do -- you know, if that

12

was all tethered to a requirement as to who

13

gets issued a library card, if you had a

14

professor who was sort of visiting that

15

semester and only learning and not teaching,

16

would they really deny him a library card?

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no.

Okay.

But, Mr. Clement -­
But then you go to

20

her second point, which the second point was:

21

What about the purposes as Congress reveals

22

them?

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Could we -­
You can see in -- in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I ask your

indulgence -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

Yeah.
-- and just before you

talk to -- about purposes?

6

Just, you know, my -- what my

7

hypothetical was designed to do, and I came up

8

with a bunch of them and I'll spare you -­

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. CLEMENT:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Thank you.
-- is to have a

12

three-to-two correspondence.

13

to Justice Breyer was right away:

14

hypotheticals have a two-to-two correspondence

15

and that's different.

16

Your answer back
Well, your

My hypothetical had a three-to-two

17

correspondence and you had to do a little bit

18

of stretching to get one of the -- the middle

19

term in.

20

But the question is does that force

21

you to stress -- to stretch so much that you

22

get the first term in, when the first term

23

pretty naturally pairs with the other, with the

24

-- with the selling word, and that's what

25

you're asking us to do.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
16
1

And I think to put the point more

2

generally, the fact that you have to do a

3

little bit of stretching to get partsmen in

4

does not compel you to do a lot of stretching

5

to get salesmen in.

6

MR. CLEMENT:

But, Justice Kagan, and

7

I -- I want to try to get back to the purpose

8

of questions, but I do think that the degree of

9

stretching you have to do to get partsmen in is

10

not a significant difference between how much

11

stretching you have to do to get the service

12

advisors in.

13

And I think that's really the key.

14

mean, maybe in your hypothetical, which you

15

designed a lot of them and you probably gave me

16

one of the best ones, and I think that's

17

because -­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. CLEMENT:

I

Now you're daring me.

Well, no, no, but -- but

21

-- but I take it that because you really

22

thought there was a big gap between the

23

designers and the salespeople in terms of the

24

stretching.

25

case with the partsmen.

And I just don't think that's the
And I really do think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
17
1

-- I mean, the partsmen, I mean, God love the

2

partsmen, but they're pretty far removed from

3

the action of turning the wrenches.

4

I actually think that if you did an

5

empirical test as to who got under the hood

6

more often, the service advisors would win.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Mr. Clement, one -­
Well, why can't you

say that this -- the partsmen, they're exempt

10

because Congress put them there specifically

11

and you don't have to match them with anything.

12

Congress may have been overbroad because they

13

started with the farm equipment people.

14

So, if we just look at the two others,

15

why should we stretch service advisor to come

16

within the mechanic who's actually servicing

17

when we know that the service advisor doesn't

18

even possess the skills to be engaged in

19

servicing?

20

MR. CLEMENT:

So, Justice Ginsburg, I

21

don't -- I don't think the service advisor is

22

differently situated from the partsman in terms

23

of having the skills to go under the hood and

24

turn the wrenches himself or herself.

25

I think, as to the answer to your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
18
1

question about why don't we just say, hey, the

2

partsmen are in because the partsmen are in,

3

because the structure of the statute doesn't

4

let you say just the partsmen are in.

5

partsmen are in because they are primarily

6

engaged in selling or servicing automobiles.

The

7

Now, I take it that the partsmen don't

8

sell the automobiles, so they must be in either

9

because selling or servicing is just sort of a

10

catch-all that gets everything that the

11

dealership basically does, or it's because we

12

have a broad enough conception of servicing to

13

include the partsmen.

14

Now, the way that I understand this

15

Court to interpret statutes is, once you

16

interpret a statutory term to have a certain

17

breadth, I mean, that's what it has, even in

18

like Clark v. Martinez, even when you have to

19

stretch the language of the Constitution to

20

avoid a -- of a statute to avoid a

21

constitutional problem -­

22

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you have an

23

example of a partsman that is not engaged in

24

servicing automobiles, say a partsman in

25

another office and he -- downtown from the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
19
1

dealership, and he just picks up the phone and

2

orders parts or something?

3

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure.

I mean, first of

4

all, you could have a partsman who's not

5

employed by an automobile dealership at all,

6

that they're just an independent partsman or

7

they work at AutoZone or something like that.

8

I don't think they're covered by the terms of

9

the statute.

10

So I do think you have to interpret

11

the statute so you tether partsman to a term

12

like servicing.

13

it to have a certain breadth, I don't think it

14

can shrink back down so it can be wide as to

15

partsmen but narrow as to service advisors.

16

And so I do think then the service

And then, once you interpret

17

advisors do come comfortably within the text of

18

the statute, and we haven't talked about the

19

fact that for four decades they've been treated

20

that way, which I think -­

21

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, I -- I wanted

22

to ask you, you mentioned in your argument that

23

there's been decades of reliance.

24
25

If we want to adopt that argument and
say, well, there's been reliance here, it's a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
20
1

close question, we're not sure, it's ambiguous,

2

what case do I cite to show that reliance bears

3

on the interpretation of the statute?

4

MR. CLEMENT:

I think you'd cite -­

5

among other things, you could cite the

6

Christopher case, the Christopher against

7

SmithKline case, which is another FLSA case.

8

And this Court averted to the reliance interest

9

both in deciding not to apply our deference but

10

also in interpreting the statute.

11

And I think the principle isn't, you

12

know, well, if for four decades people have got

13

it wrong, we'll get it wrong.

14

I -- I think the principle is, you

15

know, as -- as the -- as the Seventh Circuit

16

said in the Yi case, which Christopher cited, I

17

mean, it's -- it's no mean feat to conclude

18

that an agency has been in open, notorious

19

violation of the FLSA for four decades.

20

And I think the behavior of the

21

industry is some evidence of what those terms

22

meant.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The agency, as I

24

understand it, the agency gave up after two

25

circuits rejected its position.

So the agency

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
21
1

acquiesced in the Fourth and Fifth Circuit

2

position.

3

But last time around, I noticed your

4

argument about the massive retroactive

5

liability.

6

provision that says someone who relies in good

7

faith on the agency position doesn't have

8

retroactive liability?

9

And I said, well, what about this

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, it's -- I think

10

that the issue, I'm happy to discuss that,

11

that's the Portal-to-Portal Act affirmative

12

defense, I think our reliance on that is even

13

more complicated now because it doesn't just

14

allow for no damages when you've relied on the

15

agency in the abstract.

16

about relying on agency regulations.

It specifically talks

17

So at least since 2011, when you had

18

the last change in administrative position, I

19

don't think we'd be able to rely on the

20

Portal-to-Portal Act affirmative defense to say

21

we're not subject to liability.

22

The other thing my friends on the

23

other side say is that, well, you know, there's

24

this other exemption, 207(i), that will help at

25

least those that were paid on a majority basis

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
22
1

for a commission.

2

Now, there's a couple of things about

3

that.

4

is there -- there -- there -- I don't know the

5

exact number, but there are a sizable number of

6

people in the industry who are paid majority

7

salary, and so they'd have to be restructured.

8
9

I mean, I think the most important one

But the other thing is it's a little
bit rich for my friends on the other side to

10

say:

11

I mean, when they filed this complaint, they

12

must have had some theory as to why we weren't

13

already covered by 7(i).

14

Don't worry about this because of 7(i).

So I think that just shows that what

15

-- what the industry has relied on for four

16

decades is not some combination of the

17

Portal-to-Portal Act in 207(i).

18

agency -- what the industry's relied on is the

19

idea that in this context, you know, it is this

20

exemption that exempts all service advisors,

21

not just those that are paid primarily on a

22

commission.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What the

When I think of these

24

three categories of workers, so service

25

providers, partsmen, mechanics, to coin a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
23
1

couple of silly kind of words, a service

2

advisor is customer-facing.

3

the -- the primary -- the primary job is to

4

deal with customers, to sell them things, to

5

liaison with them, to make sure they're happy.

6

You know, it's -­

Mechanics, and also partsmen, are

7

car-facing.

You know, their job is to do stuff

8

with the car.

9

ways, the partsman is more helping, but their

And, you know, in different

10

-- their focus is on the automobile, whereas

11

the service provider's focus is on the

12

customer.

13

That seems to me a pretty big divide,

14

suggesting that the service providers are

15

really, you know, salesmen, not servicers.

16
17
18

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Your Honor, a

couple of things.
First of all, you probably anticipate

19

that I'm going to take you back to the partsmen

20

again because I do think describing the

21

partsmen as just vehicle-facing really

22

misdescribes what they do.

23

you, if you have the time, to look at that 1966

24

entrance on the auto partsman counterman,

25

because what it talks about is, you know, they

And I would ask

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
24
1

really -- sometimes they sell direct parts to

2

retail customers.

3

customer-facing.

4

So sometimes they too are

And that's all part of what they are

5

primarily engaged in, which is not just facing

6

the car.

7

is the parts, whether it's the mechanic that

8

wants the parts for a particular repair or

9

whether it's some outside customer who wants to

It's really -- their responsibility

10

buy a part because they're a do-it-yourselfer.

11

Now -- so I really think the partsmen are in

12

the middle in a way that does really give

13

servicing a broad compass.

14

The other thing I would say is I don't

15

think you can underestimate the degree to which

16

these three occupations, especially in light of

17

the way the industry has structured itself for

18

the last four decades, really do go together.

19

There are many dealerships, as I understand it,

20

who -- essentially, the commission is a pot

21

that is shared by the service advisors, the

22

partsmen, and by the mechanics that all work at

23

some dealerships.

24

commission, and it all comes out of the same

25

pot, which, of course, gets to the common sense

They all get paid on a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
25
1

of the matter, which is, if the service

2

advisors don't do their job, there's not much

3

of a job for the partsmen or the mechanics to

4

do.

5

service advisors -­

6

There's no -- there's no work to do if the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is -- is everybody

7

who's in a service department -- does everybody

8

count as primarily engaged in servicing

9

automobiles who's in a service department, the

10

receptionist, the filers?

11

MR. CLEMENT:

The answer is I'm not

12

sure.

13

think it matters much because, of course, to be

14

exempt, you not only have to be primarily

15

engaged in servicing, you also have to be a

16

salesperson, a partsman, or a mechanic.

17

I think probably not.

But I also don't

So if you take somebody like a car -­

18

a car porter, you know, are they primarily

19

engaged in servicing?

20

of partsman is probably broad enough to say

21

yes.

22

way, they're not exempt.

23
24
25

I think the definition

You might disagree with me.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But, either

What about an

automobile upholsterer?
MR. CLEMENT:

Again, I would say that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
26
1

that's somebody who might be primarily engaged

2

in servicing, but they wouldn't be covered

3

because they're not a mechanic, they're not a

4

partsman, and they're not a salesperson.

5
6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How about if the

service advisor -­

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

What -- what role do

8

-- what role do the -- the three objects at the

9

end of the sentence play in your

10

interpretation?

11

yet.

12

We haven't discussed those

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I -- I hope they

13

play this role, Your Honor, which is I think

14

it's common ground among -- between the parties

15

that those are distributed to each other

16

noun/gerund combination.

17

saying, well, the first goes with the first

18

when it comes to the object, so the only people

19

that are exempt are the farm dealer mechanics.

So nobody's here

20

And I think that just shows -- I mean,

21

it would be really odd -- anything is possible,

22

of course, but it would be really odd if the

23

way you read the statute is with -- the nouns

24

vis-a-vis the gerunds, you apply this reddendo

25

principle, but with respect to the gerunds

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
27
1

vis-a-vis the objects, you apply the normal

2

"or" means "or" principle.

3

I think the real way to apply this

4

statute -- and, honestly, I think what is the

5

only thing that really ought to be left of the

6

reddendo canon is the commonsense principle

7

that when you have these disjunctive series, if

8

they combine in a way that really is something

9

like the null set, you ignore it.

You don't

10

lose a lot of sleep over it, and it's fine

11

because, you know, I'm not here to tell you

12

there are mechanics who are primarily engaged

13

in selling automobiles.

14

But since there aren't any, you don't

15

really have to lose any sleep over it, and you

16

shouldn't construe the statute primarily based

17

on the fact that there's a null set with one

18

combination, especially when there's 100,000

19

flesh-and-blood examples of salesmen who are

20

primarily engaged in servicing.

21
22
23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

What about our

narrow construction canon?
MR. CLEMENT:

Well, that's an

24

interesting question, Your Honor.

I mean, you

25

know, the Ninth Circuit applied that, and I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
28
1

suppose that, you know, the Ninth -- the -- the

2

canon that the Ninth Circuit applied and the

3

one it derived from one of this Court -­

4

Court's older cases talks about being plainly

5

and unmistakably within the exemption.

6

Now, I'm a big enough believer in my

7

argument here that I think maybe we even meet

8

the plain and unmistakable test, but I also

9

think, as we've urged the Court, that it may be

10
11

time to put that canon to rest.
And I'm not suggesting that the FLSA

12

should be interpreted differently from any

13

other statute.

14

statutory construction that exemptions are not

15

construed to swallow the rule.

16

It's a general principle of

I think that's a perfectly sensible

17

rule of construction.

18

of amp that up to the degree that it is -- has

19

to be plain and unmistakable to come within the

20

exemption really is contrary to the way this

21

Court generally interprets statutes.

22

But I do think to sort

I don't think it makes a lot of sense,

23

especially if you remember that a lot of these

24

exemptions are being passed much later in

25

history than the 1938 enactment of the FLSA.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
29
1

So even if you accept the proposition

2

that, in 1938, Congress had an unalloyed

3

interest in being remedial in the FLSA, I don't

4

know why that would inform your interpretation

5

of an exemption enacted in 1966 for the express

6

purpose of at least having some employees not

7

covered by the FLSA.

8
9

And I do think that this would be an
odd statute to have this plain and unmistakable

10

test when it's riddled with exemptions.

11

there were ever one statute where you'd say,

12

okay, Congress, yeah, it had a very important

13

purpose, it was a worthy purpose, but it didn't

14

pursue it at all costs, it would be this

15

statute.

16

So, if

If you look at 213, which has the

17

various exemptions to both the minimum wage

18

laws and the overtime laws, as I count it up,

19

there are 31 exemptions to the -- to the -- to

20

the minimum wage and overtime laws just in 213,

21

and there are other exemptions in other places

22

in the statute.

23

that the way we're going to interpret this is

24

only with a thumb on the scale in favor of the

25

coverage and against the exemptions.

So what an odd statute to say

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Feldman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

7
8
9
10

Thank you,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The exemption in this case is for any

11

salesman, partsman, or mechanic primarily

12

engaged in selling or servicing automobiles.

13

The most obvious reason why or the clearest

14

reason why service advisors don't come within

15

that exemption is they don't service

16

automobiles.

17

In our brief, we cite five -- I think

18

the five most authoritative dictionaries of the

19

English language, and they define "service" -­

20

"to service" as to maintain or repair.

21

maintain -- you don't maintain or repair a car,

22

in the way people would ordinarily speak, with

23

a pad or a clipboard and a pencil or a

24

telephone, which are the primary tools that

25

service advisors use.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

You

Official
31
1

You do it back in the back of the shop

2

when you're actually working on the car.

3

Service advisors don't do that, and, therefore,

4

they -- they don't service cars.

5

repair or maintain them.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They don't

Well, I guess

7

sometimes, though, I mean, they do look under

8

the hood sometimes, right?

9

up, you know, it's making this noise, they go

You bring the car

10

out and at least listen to the noise, and

11

sometimes they can say right away:

12

probably this.

13

down, and whether the customer is still there

14

or comes back later, all that they do in the -­

15

the mechanics or the partsmen, send it up and

16

then plug it in and it's right.

17

Oh, that's

And then they send something

So, I mean, in certain situations, the

18

advisor would play the primary role in fixing

19

the problem, not when it's more complex, maybe

20

not typically, but certainly in what I suppose

21

would be many occasions.

22

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I don't think so.

23

I mean, actually, I think what the advisor does

24

is make a guess, but really -- of what might be

25

wrong based on what the customer says.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I mean,

sometimes the customer goes in and says:

I

2

want a 20,000-mile check -- servicing.

4

need a 20-mile -- 20,000-mile servicing.

But

even -­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

-- I guess what I'm saying, sometimes the

13

primary decision in servicing the car is going

14

to be made by the service advisor, at least the

15

initial thing.

16

Sometimes -- I

You know, send something down.

The -- the mechanic may well look at

17

it himself or herself, but the service advisor

18

says it's a distributor cap or whatever, and it

19

turns out it is, they put it on, and it's done.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

Yeah, I -- I think

21

actually the service advisor's job -- they may

22

make a guess as to what's wrong and give the

23

customer -- say, well, it might be the

24

distributor cap.

25

to actually figure out what's wrong, not the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

advisor meets the customer in the morning and

supervise and to plan the servicing of your

automobile.

true, it seems to me he's engaged in servicing

the automobile.

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I don't think so

22

because I -- I think there's a huge difference,

23

as a matter of -- he's definitely not servicing

24

the automobile just because he's arranging for

25

it.

There's many people who arrange for the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
34

provision of services but don't perform the

2

service themselves.

3

If somebody is -- I will take the

4

example of some salesmen.

This is particularly

5

true of the difference between sales and

6

service, which are pretty much two distinct

7

categories.

and selling house painting services, says, you

scheduled the timing and so forth, I think they

18

could be -- they could be supervising the

19

painting of the house.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I mean, actually

21

supervising service -- supervising a repair

22

also isn't the same thing as repairing.

23

do think that it's quite clear, and you can

24

look at the machinist's brief, these people in

25

no sense supervise the mechanics.

figure out what to do.

6

It's up to the mechanic or

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I

7

mean, just in -- and maybe this isn't the best

8

guide to the interpretation, but it's sort of

9

common understanding if you, over several

10

years, dropped your car off whenever you're

11

supposed to or whenever it's broken and -- and

12

you talk to Fred about getting it fixed, and -­

13

and somebody comes to you later and says

14

something -- I've got a problem with my car,

15

you would say my service guy is Fred, go see

16

him.

17

It's just sort of your general

18

reaction is that is part of the service -- not

19

only that, it's the part, the only part that

20

you have experience with.

21

of Fred as the person who services your car -­

You can read it that

12

"involved in" instead of "engaged in."

15

I have no doubt that might even be the

MR. FELDMAN:

Suppose the word were

"Involved in" would

bring it much closer and actually -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, it would.

And

16

so what we're doing is we're trying to parse

17

the difference between "engaged in" and

18

"involved in" in a fairly technical statute

19

involving one of 40,000 different kinds of

20

workers as part of a very general statute.

21

Now, that to me rings a bell that if

22

this isn't a question for an agency, what is?

23

Now, all right.

So, if I'm thinking

24

that, and maybe no one else is, I'm only

25

speaking for myself, I was sort of surprised

Heritage Reporting Corporation

that nobody in the Ninth Circuit referred to a

2

doctrine that nobody refers to anymore.

called primary jurisdiction.

4

used to ask the relevant department to file a

5

brief, and nobody did that.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's

And it can be

No.
Now, suppose I -­

8

suppose -- suppose I -- I think, gee, I don't

9

know the answer to this question.

It's highly

10

technical.

The purpose,

11

apparently, was that they put these mechanics

12

in there because they had farm equipment

13

somewhere, that people go in the middle of the

14

night, so they didn't have fixed hours.

15

Whether that was so or not, I don't know.

16

I do look to purpose.

And maybe the service person would

17

call at 2 in the morning and tell the farmer

18

he's coming, in which case he doesn't have

19

fixed hours, so he should be exempt too.

20

I don't know.

21

you see the attitude?

Congress picked out only three and

they picked out those three for a particular

reason.

that we cite, all three of those share

18

something in common, and service advisors not

19

only don't share that but have a different

20

quality that makes them much more likely to be

21

in the statute.

22

And if you look at actually the things

JUSTICE BREYER:

farmers at 2 in the morning, did the service

MR. FELDMAN:

They were right about

I don't think they were

23

wrong.

I think what they decided is they

24

wanted to include partsmen and mechanics, who I

25

think reasonably are both said to be servicing

cars, and they then decided to include the

2

whole categories and not just limit it to -- to

3

farm implements or a particular kind of

4

mechanic or partsman, as long as they're

5

servicing cars.

6

That was the limitation.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But your definition of

7

servicing, which I think is a very natural one,

8

I mean, and not just, you know, natural, it's

9

the dictionary definition of servicing, but it

10
11
12
13

has to cope with this partsmen word.
How does -- how do partsmen fit within
your definition of servicing?
MR. FELDMAN:

Okay.

Well, I do -- I

think partsmen are reasonably said to be

servicing cars.

that they are servicing cars.

And -- and I guess also a car is nothing
And for all those

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but

11

diagnosis is part of the servicing as well, and

12

the service advisors at least do that.

13

the mechanic isn't going to know what -- he

14

needs to know what the problem is.

15

service advisor will spend a fair amount of

16

time trying to get a description from the

17

customer -- sometimes it's easy, you know, the

18

-- the car won't start.

19

it's -- it's -- it's going to be harder, and

20

they need to get a good description.

I mean,

the person who takes down your symptoms at the

25

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I think actually

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
42

the -- the relevant question is, is he or she

2

providing the treatment?

3

They're giving an initial guess.

4

And I would say no.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, the

5

statute talks about being engaged in.

that person engaged in the medical treatment?

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think he's

engaged in treating.

So is

He -- he may be -- may be

it's the -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But the dictionary

definition of engaged says to do or take part

14

in something.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

Right.

And -- and, you

16

know, there is, as far as "engaged in" goes,

17

this Court has, I mean, I actually did a Lexis

18

search, and this Court does -- has used the

19

term 500 times.

20

the U.S. Code.

21

It's used about 2,000 times in

It's used in the FLSA.

In actually

22

one of the provisions, in 2 -- 213(d) in the

23

same statute, it's engaged in the delivery of

24

newspapers.

25

It's an extremely common word.

And I can't find any instance in which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
43
1

any court has ever construed it to mean

2

anything other than what Black's Law Dictionary

3

says, which is to do something customarily or

4

regularly or continually.

5

It doesn't mean doing something that's

6

ancillary to that activity.

7

203(d) talks about engaged in the delivery of

8

newspaper, and there's an exemption for people

9

like that.

10

So if you're -­

If you're calling somebody up on the

11

phone and saying:

12

delivery of your newspaper, I don't think that

13

person is covered under that provision.

14

this Court were to construe "engaged in" to be

15

a term of breadth like that in this case, I

16

think it would actually upset a lot of settled

17

expectations across broad areas of the law.

18

Would you like your home

And if

When Congress wants to include -­

19

wants to broaden out a term, it uses terms like

20

necessary and -- consequent and necessary to,

21

which -- I'm sorry, necessary and incidental

22

to, which it uses in a couple of the FLSA

23

provisions that we cite, or it uses terms like

24

"the process of," which it uses regularly

25

throughout the U.S. Code.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
44
1

But I don't think there's any basis to

2

take in this statute, which is very, actually,

3

care -- finely written, to take the word

4

servicing or engaged in servicing and say:

5

Well, no, no, they mean something, like, in the

6

criminal law, you might say someone is an

7

accessory before the fact if they helped the

8

crime before it's committed or after the fact

9

if they help it afterwards.

10

I don't think -- but -- but in the

11

criminal law, actually, if you didn't have 18

12

U.S.C. Section 2, which made those people

13

liable as principals, they wouldn't be liable

14

for the crime.

15

And I do think it's the same principle

16

here.

17

servicing, they're talking about the people who

18

service, not the people who, I would concede,

19

do things that are necessary and incidental to

20

the servicing.

21

that.

22

When they're talking about engaged in

There's many people who do

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Feldman, when -­

23

when you talked about the purposes, you focused

24

on the fact that service advisors work on-site

25

and don't work irregular hours.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
45
1

I believe that Mr. Clement's argument,

2

and he'll correct me if I'm wrong, focuses on

3

the fact of commissions, that these people,

4

like other kinds of salesmen and like

5

mechanics, are often compensated through

6

commission schemes.

7

What about that?

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

I -- I think that

commissions are actually completely irrelevant

10

to this provision.

11

at the car dealership, including some -- many

12

of the ones who I mentioned who are paid on

13

commissions, who are not exempt.

14

people at car dealerships and throughout the

15

economy who are exempt and who are not paid on

16

commissions.

17

There's many other people

There's many

In fact, if -- where Congress was

18

interested in commissions as a basis for an

19

exemption, they provided one in 207(i).

20

you're paid more than 50 percent on commissions

21

and you make more than one and a half times the

22

minimum wage, then you can get -- you can be

23

exempt under that provision.

24
25

If

It is possible that at least going
forward -- and I would correct my friend -- at

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
46
1

the time of the complaint, one thing that was

2

true here -- that's alleged in the complaint is

3

that the dealership was not, up until recently,

4

it says, keeping track of the time and the

5

hours spent.

6

So, actually, they would have had a

7

hard time keeping track -- even though they're

8

required by law to do that, they would have had

9

a hard time keeping -- making out the 207(i)

10

exemption.

11

be in this case that these people are covered

12

by 207(i).

13

But in -- but going forward, it may

You know, they're -- as far as the

14

reliance interest that my friend mentioned, I

15

actually think the reliance argument cuts

16

exactly the other way.

17

had the case before, they were -- the question

18

that the Court said it was interest -- it was

19

concerned with about reliance was whether the

20

19 -- people had been relying on the 1978 DOL

21

letter and whether the agency in 2011 was

22

required to give some explanation of why it

23

changed its mind.

24
25

In -- when this Court

That's actually -- so that question is
no longer in the case.

The regulation, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
47
1

Court said, is not controlling here.

2

But what has happened is, in 2011, DOL

3

did tell everybody that it thought service

4

advisors are not exempt from the -- from the -­

5

are not exempt.

And in 2015, the Ninth Circuit

6

decided a case.

In 2016, about two years ago,

7

this Court remanded the case to the Ninth

8

Circuit.

9

By that time and long before that,

10

probably from 2000 -- in fact, I know from 2011

11

on, dealerships were being informed that

12

service advisors -- advisors might well be

13

covered here and that there is -- they might -­

14

you might -- they might be entitled to

15

overtime.

16

And it was certain -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, could you add

17

to that, or correct me if I'm wrong, that in

18

the two circuit cases that ruled against the

19

FLSA, the government had taken the opposite

20

position?

21

MR. FELDMAN:

That's right.

That's

22

right.

But I -- I think my point about

23

reliance is if you actually -- there's a

24

two-year statute of limitations here.

25

Everybody has known since 2011, and certainly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
48
1

since two years ago when this Court decided the

2

case last time, that there -- that these people

3

might be entitled to overtime.

4

There -- as far as I can tell, there's

5

been two cases at most, and I'm not sure about

6

both of them, one in the District of Arizona

7

and one in the Western District -- I think it's

8

the Western District of New York, that have

9

been filed claiming that service advisors are

10
11

entitled to overtime.

That's it, two cases.

So I think that in the -- the logical

12

inference to be drawn is that most

13

dealerships -- some dealerships are probably

14

paying overtime right now to service advisors.

15

In fact, I know that some are.

16

dealerships -- many, many dealerships, probably

17

the vast majority of them, have made -- have

18

arranged things so they come within the 207(i)

19

exemption.

Some

20

And the reliance now -- what really is

21

-- what -- what this case easily could be about

22

is whether dealerships can stop paying overtime

23

to people whom they're currently paying and

24

whether dealerships can change the terms of

25

their arrangements with service advisors so

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
49
1

that the people who have -- have been coming

2

under 207(i), they can -- they don't have to

3

comply with the limitations of 207(i).

4

don't have to comply with the minimum -- one

5

and a half times the minimum wage and so on.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They

Mr. -- Mr. Feldman,

7

I -- I don't understand from what you said

8

whether you are disagreeing with me that there

9

would be no retroactive liability because

10

employers relied in good faith on what had been

11

the agency's position.

12

MR. FELDMAN:

The -- I -- I agree with

13

you that would -- there could be good-faith

14

reliance that -- in this case, I think there

15

would be good-faith reliance up until 2011.

16

Then the complaint here was filed in 2012.

17

we would -- could only go back as far as 2011.

18

There would be good-faith reliance.

19

So

But the point is that isn't going to

20

be relevant to future cases.

21

cases, I think, as far as I'm aware.

22

there's another one that I haven't been able to

23

find, but I've tried to look for them.

24
25

There's only two
Maybe

There's only two cases currently
pending, but I think really the Court should be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
50
1

very careful about giving a lot of weight to -­

2

to claims of reliance where what well might be

3

happening is people are paying overtime and

4

bringing their service advisors in 207(i) and

5

what they really want to do is stop paying the

6

overtime and stop bringing their service

7

advisors within 207(i).

8
9

And so I don't think the -- the
reliance issue that my friend discussed, I just

10

don't think that's a reason to decide the case

11

that way.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Feldman, the

13

Solicitor General is not here in a case in

14

which one would expect the government to be

15

here.

16

taking place in the Department of Labor with

17

respect to this issue?

Do you know whether there's any activity

18
19

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't know.

I -- I

just don't know about that.

20

Yeah, I would make one -- one other

21

point about the purpose -- the purposes of the

22

statute.

23

people and especially auto salesmen, which is

24

where -- what Petitioner says the service

25

advisors are, the three categories that

So one of them was, these three

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
51
1

Congress included are people who work irregular

2

hours and off-site where it's hard to keep

3

track of people's hours.

4

Now, service advisors have a different

5

-- another feature.

6

work off-site.

7

hours.

8

work that cuts in the opposite direction.

9

First of all, they never

They rarely work irregular

But there's another feature of how they

The complaint in this case alleges

10

that service advisors -- the service advisors

11

in this case work 55 hours a week.

12

Congress wanted to do in the Fair Labor Act was

13

to set minimum standards of working conditions.

14

And at the very least, they did -- they thought

15

that should be 40 hours a week and that should

16

be basically what people are expected to work.

17

Now, what

Now, mechanics and partsmen, as well

18

as, you know, warranty salesmen, lube

19

technicians, all the other people at the auto

20

dealership work an occasional overtime hour,

21

but these people, this is their standard week

22

after week, regular hours, 55 hours.

23

Congress when it -- Congress, in the

24

FLSA, thought that that was -- that was the

25

kind of thing they didn't want to have happen

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
52
1

and, particularly because there was a second

2

purpose of the maximum hours of the overtime

3

requirement, which is they wanted the people

4

who are -- instead of employing somebody for 55

5

hours, they wanted to say:

6

somebody else to fill in that extra time,

7

because they wanted to expand employment

8

opportunities at the same time as they were,

9

you know, legislating in favor of -­

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, go hire

Well, but if -- if

11

you have a service advisor in the morning and

12

then a different one in the afternoon, that's a

13

completely different -- changed dynamic from

14

the same person saying we found a little

15

problem and we went ahead and did X, Y, or

16

whatever.

17

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, I mean, I -- I

18

just would say:

one is, that does happen

19

sometimes.

20

this is to have fewer days worked and you can

21

have longer hours.

22

that work that way.

23

the work around.

24

in the middle of the day.

25

dealership doesn't do any of those things.

Two, is another way to deal with

There's many occupations
You can -- you can share

You can give people time off
Okay?

This

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
53
1

They -- it's a -- it's a 55-hour week.

2

And that's exactly the purpose of the F -­

3

these are people that come directly within the

4

purposes of the FLSA.

5

that Congress didn't include them in the

6

statute when it included salesmen, partsmen,

7

and mechanics.

8
9

And it's no coincidence

Another -- I would say also that
Petitioner's argument is primarily -- is that

10

service advisors are salesmen.

11

on page 5 of the reply brief, Petitioner says

12

they're salesmen because they are principally

13

involved in selling.

14

expect salesmen to do.

15

And, actually,

And that's what you would

But that does create a logical problem

16

for Petitioner because, if you're principally

17

involved in -- you can't be principally

18

involved or it's hard to be principally

19

involved in two different things, especially

20

two things as different as selling and

21

servicing.

22

So, if they're principally involved in

23

selling, which is what Petitioner says makes

24

them a salesman, and I think what would make

25

them a salesman if they were, then it's -- it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
54
1

impossible to say that they're -- then it's

2

hard to turn around and say:

3

principally engaged in servicing.

4

No, no, they're

The -- the two categories are distinct

5

in the statute.

And as examples I gave of the

6

house painter or the -- a -- a travel agent

7

who's selling guided tours is -- you know, or a

8

AAA person who's selling you roadside

9

assistance.

All those people are selling you

10

things.

11

idea of selling something is a fundamentally

12

different concept than the idea of actually

13

doing it.

14

that I don't think Petitioner can escape.

15

They're not doing them because the

And that's a problem -- a problem

I mean, that is the reason why what

16

Congress did is they -- they put service

17

advisors with all the other people in the auto

18

dealership who I mentioned who are not exempt

19

and who get overtime.

20

I think even Petitioner doesn't

21

actually believe, at least in one respect, that

22

-- that service advisors are principally

23

engaged in selling -- in servicing automobiles.

24

There are people at the dealership who sell

25

underbody coatings and assorted paint sealants,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
55
1

upholstery treatments, tire treatments.

2

people are definitely salesmen.

3

job, is to sell.

4

Those

That is their

They -- those -- those things are all

5

services that are provided to the car.

6

Petitioner has conceded from the beginning of

7

this litigation that those people who do that

8

kind of selling, that they are not covered by

9

the statute.

10

And yet

And I think that just is a natural

11

conclusion that Petitioner draws because I

12

think that's the natural way to read this

13

statute.

14

Petitioner -- my friend did refer to

15

the -- said that the Department of Labor has

16

taken the position that auto -- that auto body

17

repair people are not covered by the -- the

18

statute.

19

mistaken.

20

I think that that is actually

The only cite -- source for that is in

21

a footnote in the reply brief.

It's a 1968

22

opinion letter by Department of Labor, and what

23

Department of Labor said there -- first of all,

24

the opinion letter stood for the proposition

25

and addressed the question of whether auto

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
56
1

painters are covered by the statute, are

2

exempt, and it concluded that they're not

3

exempt.

4

But, secondly, it did then talk about

5

a category it called body and fender mechanics.

6

And it suggested that they are not -- that they

7

are exempt under this statute.

8
9

Well, I just think it's worthwhile
looking at what happened to that.

In 1970,

10

body and fender mechanics were included in the

11

original version of the -- of the regulation as

12

an example of the kind of people who are

13

considered to be mechanics and could be exempt.

14

In 1973, three years later, I think it

15

was the first revision of it, they kept the

16

list of people who are mechanics the same and

17

removed body and fender mechanics.

18

the only thing you can conclude is the

19

Department of Labor has not concluded and there

20

isn't a history of saying that even body and

21

fender mechanics are not covered, but whether

22

they're covered or not would be a different

23

question, but at least auto body repairmen are

24

not.

25

So I think

Congress picked three distinct

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
57
1

professions who were well recognized at the

2

time of the statute and said, you know, we want

3

those occupations, specific occupations to be

4

exempt for the reasons that I said, that

5

service advisors were a well-recognized

6

occupation at that time.

7

They -- they were recognized in the

8

Occupational Outlook Handbook.

They had been

9

recognized in NLRB decisions from the 1940s on,

10

in industry publications.

11

why they're a distinct occupation, because if

12

you look at the jobs that they do, it's

13

actually a completely different job than the

14

job that's done by -- by auto salesmen, who are

15

the people who Congress undoubtedly wanted to

16

include.

17

And there's a reason

The one other thing I'd like to say is

18

about the distributive or reddendo canon.

19

mean, we don't -- we -- what that canon stands

20

for is the proposition that when you have two

21

lists like this that you have to make match up,

22

as -- as dates -- as -- as in the Simms case,

23

is actually a great example, where you have

24

three in the first category and two in the

25

second and you have to match them up, it is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official
58
1

common, and there are or's -- they're connected

2

by the word "or," it's common in the English

3

language to say, well, we match up the ones

4

that actually fit according to the context, but

5

we don't have to struggle and strain to twist

6

the ordinary meanings of words or something

7

like that to try to barely find a way in which

8

everything in the first list has to match with

9

everything in the second.

10

And that is all that that canon means.

11

It means that it's perfectly acceptable and was

12

what Congress, I think, did, is to say salesmen

13

match up with sells, they are etymologically

14

related, they're semantically related, that's

15

what Congress intended to do, and it matches

16

perfectly.

17

Partsmen and mechanics match up with

18

servicing.

Salesmen don't match up with

19

servicing and, in fact, insofar as someone is a

20

salesman, they're almost certainly not a

21

service person.

22

If there are no further questions.

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

5

Just a few points in rebuttal.

First

6

of all, I'd like to start with the reliance

7

issue.

8

at all to say that when the 2011 regulation

9

came in, without any explanation that was

I don't think it is factually accurate

10

ultimately deemed procedurally invalid by this

11

Court, that dealerships just stopped what they

12

were doing and changed 40 years of practices.

13

If that had happened, this suit would

14

not have happened.

15

across the country, based on that unexplained

16

regulation, dealerships continued their

17

traditional practices.

18

interests are all on our side of this case.

19

I mean, the reality is that

That's why the reliance

Now, there are also reliance interests

20

for the treatment of body repairmen who have

21

from the very beginning been treated as exempt

22

at dealerships.

23

Now, there is the letter that we cite

24

that talks about how painters are not covered

25

and body repairmen are covered.

It also cites

Heritage Reporting Corporation

legislative history -- I'll grant you the

2

legislative history was more focused -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Clement, how

4

-- Mr. Clement, your new definition, your more

5

expansive definition, tell me how many more

6

people that are involved in the service

7

department will be covered.

8
9

Will it include the dispatchers who
tell people -- who don't do anything but assign

10

the work, or the lubesmen, the upholsterers,

11

the -- all those other people who right now for

12

40 years, or more or less, have been paid a

13

salary, are they now going to be subject to

14

automobile dealerships saying:

15

definition, we can forego paying them minimum

16

wages?

17

MR. CLEMENT:

Given this new

No, Justice Sotomayor.

18

We're here -- we're on the status quo team.

19

don't -- we're not trying to get some change -­

20
21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We

Well, that's very

nice, but tell me -- but your definition -­

22

MR. CLEMENT:

Sure, sure.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- your definition

24

might very well include them -­

25

MR. CLEMENT:

It might -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- because you're

2

basically saying anybody involved in servicing

3

is covered.

4

MR. CLEMENT:

No, that's where -­

5

that's where, with all due respect, you're

6

wrong.

7

of servicing, but we also say it works in the

8

statute together with salesperson, partsman,

9

and mechanic.

10

We're -- we're giving you a definition

So, in order to be covered, you have

11

to be both.

12

categories of employee, and you have to be

13

primarily engaged in servicing.

14

You have to be one of those three

So nothing's going to change for the

15

non-mechanics, the non-salespeople, the

16

non-partsmen.

17

same because we have -- we have a definition of

18

servicing that has to include partsmen, that

19

includes service advisors, and service advisors

20

are included not because -- just because they

21

are primarily engaged in servicing but because

22

they are also salespeople.

23

Things are going to stay the

So I just wanted to say that the

24

legislative history is specific as to fender

25

and bodymen.

They -- they were -- they were

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
62
1

meant to be exempt mechanics.

2

as exempt.

3

to deal with.

4

They're treated

I hope we don't have another change

Under the status quo, body repairmen

5

are exempt.

Mechanics, traditional mechanics,

6

are exempt.

Partsmen are exempt, and sales

7

advisors are exempt, and there are real

8

reliance interests on that.

9

As to the Labor Department's position,

10

they're obviously not here.

11

reply brief points out that they have put an

12

advisory out that they are not going to take

13

any enforcement actions against sales advisors

14

until this Court rules in this case, which I

15

think just underscores that the reliance

16

interest, the status quo, is in our favor.

17

Footnote 9 of our

There's no current regulatory effort

18

to go after service advisors.

19

hasn't been one from the Labor Department

20

itself since about 1978.

21

And there really

And, Justice Breyer, if you're looking

22

for a tie-breaker with an agency somewhere, I

23

think it's four decades of acquiescence.

24

That's the last valid action from the Labor

25

Department.

The 2011 regulation was deemed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
63
1

procedurally invalid.

2

So the last word for them is 1978

3

opinion letter, 1987 enforcement manual.

4

For -- for 40 years everybody has understood

5

service advisors to be exempt, whether you

6

think about that as the -­

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Were the two

8

circuits that ruled in favor of the

9

employees -- was -- was that within the 40-year

10

period?

Didn't the agency take the position in

11

-- in those two cases that -­

12

MR. CLEMENT:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14
15

That, Justice Kennedy -­
-- they were not

covered?
MR. CLEMENT:

-- is really what starts

16

the 40 years of reliance.

17

those cases was a Fifth Circuit case called

18

Deel Motors.

19

brought by the Labor Department, but the Labor

20

Department lost.

21

So the first of

That was an enforcement action

Shortly thereafter they also lost in

22

the Sixth Circuit, and that's when they started

23

acquiescing.

24

along later, and that's a private party action.

25

It's not an enforcement action.

The Fourth Circuit case comes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official
64
1

So we do have, you know, roughly, at

2

least since 1978, we've had acquiescence from

3

the Labor Department, which gives rise to all

4

of these reliance interests.

5

In terms of the purpose of the

6

statute, I really thought it was interesting

7

that my friend on the other side emphasized the

8

fact that the service advisors work 55-hour

9

weeks because Congress, when it dealt with

10

people who by the nature of their job work long

11

weeks, they had one of two reactions to that.

12

One of it, they said:

Boy, that's

13

awful, and we want to have more workers, so

14

we're going to limit them to 40.

15

The other is they said:

16

that's the way it is in that industry, and

17

those people aren't underpaid, so we're going

18

to give them an exemption.

19

they did with service advisors.

20

Your Honor.

21
22
23
24

That's exactly what

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
counsel.

Oh, yeah,

Thank you,

Thank you,

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:02 a.m., the case

was submitted.)
