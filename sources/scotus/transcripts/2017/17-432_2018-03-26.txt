ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH A. ARONSON

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ARONSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
American Pipe gave individual

12

claimants the benefit of equitable tolling for

13

two reasons:

14

diligence by coming to court to assert his

15

claim when class certification was denied; and,

16

two, enforcing the statute of limitations would

17

undermine Rule 23 by encouraging individual

18

claimants to come forward while the class

19

action was pending.

20

One, the plaintiff had shown

Neither of those reasons suggests that

21

the Court today should expand American Pipe.

22

There's no basis to extend tolling to absent

23

class members who have not shown diligence

24

by -- by not filing their own claims when class

25

certification was denied, and once class

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

4
1

certification is denied, the extraordinary

2

circumstance of -- of protective individual

3

actions no longer exists.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is it your position

5

that once certification is denied, then members

6

of the now-defunct class can come in and bring

7

their own individual actions, but that's it?

8

That what -- what American Pipe preserves is a

9

right -- if you were a putative member of a

10

class, the class motion denied, you can then

11

bring your individual claim but not any class

12

claim?

13

MR. ARONSON:

Yes, if the statute of

14

limitations had expired and you are seeking

15

equitable tolling, then American Pipe and

16

Crown, Cork say that you can come to court and

17

assert your individual claim.

18

of limitations had not expired, another class

19

action could be brought.

20

proposing is that the Court honor the statute

21

of limitations and require that anyone who

22

wants to file a class action come to court

23

early and in no event later than the -- the

24

running of the statute of limitations.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If the statute

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But what about

2

-- what about honoring Rule 23?

It seems to me

3

that you're creating an exception to the rule.

4

If you just read it on its face, the statute of

5

limitations hasn't run because of American Pipe

6

and Crown, Cork, so why shouldn't that rule be

7

available to you?

MR. ARONSON:

The statute of
What an individual can do

is show that it's entitled to equitable

11

tolling.

12

that -- by coming forward to the court and

13

asserting your claim and to show that the

14

extraordinary circumstances no longer exists.

15

And you do that two ways.

By showing

So these people have their claims, but

16

case, we already have a determination by a

18

court twice that class certification is not

19

appropriate.

20

Remember, in this

The statute of limitations has run.

21

American Pipe and Crown, Cork say you can bring

22

your action, but it has to be an individual

23

action.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't

understand, Mr. Aronson, why the diligence

Heritage Reporting Corporation

argument doesn't work the same way in the

2

second stage, after the denial, as it does in

3

the first.

4

what we said was, if you're relying on a class

5

action, that's diligence enough.

6

In other words, in American Pipe,

Now, you know, that might itself be

7

controversial, contestable, but that's what we

8

said in American Pipe.

9

said that, I don't see why it's also not

10

And I guess, having

diligence enough to rely on a new class action.

11

MR. ARONSON:

What American Pipe and

12

Crown, Cork say, it is diligent to rely on the

13

class action until class certification is

14

denied.

15

forward with your claim.

16

And at that point, you must come

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I don't -- I mean,

17

it obviously didn't deal with this case, but

18

the whole theory of American Pipe was that for

19

any given individual, we weren't going to make

20

them come forward; we were going to say

21

reliance on a class action is sufficient to

22

show diligence.

23

So, here, these people were doing just

24

that.

They're relying on a class action.

25

happens to be a second class action, but under

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official

7
1

the same theory, they should be able to rely in

2

order to show diligence, that that's what we

3

said counted as diligence.

4

MR. ARONSON:

But once the class

5

action fails, it is not diligence to rely on an

6

untimely class.

7

statute of limitations has run.

8

court enforces the statute of limitations, all

9

of these issues would be solved up front.

That's the difference.

The

And if the

We

10

would have before the court early on in the

11

case all those who wish to present class

12

claims, not wait until the end, not wait until

13

after the statute of limitations, but everyone

14

come in early so that the district court can

15

pick the best representative and make the best

16

class determinations early on.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, that's

18

not -- the statute doesn't talk about the best

19

represent -- best representative in terms of

20

individual members.

21

representative is who has the greatest

22

financial interest.

It says the best

23

So if I'm -- if my financial interest

24

is moderately sized or small sized, there's no

25

inducement for me to do anything other than

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

8
1

what American tolling tells me to do, which is

2

to wait until the class issues are resolved

3

before stepping forward.

4

MR. ARONSON:

Well, Your Honor, I was

5

-- I was answering the question from Justice

6

Kagan in the broadest sense, but in the -­

7

under the Private Securities Litigation Reform

8

Act, the PSLRA, which you mention, yes, there's

9

a regime there that does require that these

10
11

issues be resolved early on.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It does, but it

12

says how, and that how is based on American

13

tolling, in part, because it's suggesting who

14

should be the lead counsel and the lead

15

plaintiff.

16

MR. ARONSON:

Right.

The PSLRA does

17

have a regime set out for who should be the

18

lead plaintiff and the lead counsel, and it -­

19

and it anticipates that there will be multiple

20

class actions filed and those class actions

21

will be consolidated, and then the court will

22

pick the best lead plaintiff and the best lead

23

plaintiff's counsel.

24
25

And that regime is -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So your regime is

now encouraging the very thing that American

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

9
1

Pipe was trying to avoid, which is to have a

2

multiplicity of suits being filed and

3

encouraging every class member to come forth

4

and file their own suit.

5

MR. ARONSON:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

That's what you're

suggesting has to be done.

8
9

No, Your Honor.

MR. ARONSON:

No, American Pipe and

Crown, Cork say we don't want you bringing your

10

individual actions while the class action is

11

pending.

12

your own class action.

It says nothing about bringing on

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16
17

Please tell me -­

Well -­
I'm sorry, go

ahead.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let's suppose you're

18

right about that, Mr. Aronson, that what Rule

19

23 is primarily about, it's a comparison of

20

class actions to individual actions and saying

21

there are times in which we think class actions

22

is the more efficient way to do things than a

23

million individual actions.

24
25

But, again, that interest seems to be
the same here because, once the class

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

10
1

certification is denied, you're saying, well,

2

now everybody has to come bring their

3

individual actions.

4

And I think what somebody who was

5

looking at the American Pipe reasoning might

6

say is something to the effect of:

7

as, at time one, it made more sense to have a

8

class action than a thousand individual

9

actions, so too, at time two, it makes more

No, just

10

sense to have a class action than a thousand

11

individual actions.

12

Nothing has changed.

13

MR. ARONSON:

Well, American Pipe and

14

Crown, Cork say you bring your individual

15

actions.

16

what the courts have said should happen

17

because -­

18

So this is not my proposal.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's

Well, here, again, of

19

course, they didn't deal with this case.

20

I'm suggesting is that both interests that they

21

mention are served in the identical way with

22

respect to what should happen after denial of a

23

class certification motion as before.

24
25

MR. ARONSON:

All

In the abstract, yes,

Your Honor, but when the statute of limitations

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

11
1

intervenes and it does cut off rights, then we

2

have to see whether or not the individual

3

members are entitled to equitable tolling.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, there was always

5

a question in American Pipe that we were doing

6

something extraordinary, that we were saying it

7

doesn't matter that the statute of limitations

8

has run on you.

9

Because we think -- thought that there was

And we did it for two reasons:

10

enough diligence and because we thought that

11

Rule 23 policies indicated that we should

12

encourage the class action device rather than

13

the individual action device.

14

And here, again, the exact same thing

15

is true.

16

reliance on the class, and, once again, even

17

after the denial of a single motion for class

18

certification, Rule 23 would indicate that we

19

don't want to have a million individual suits

20

but instead want to encourage a class.

21

Diligence is shown in the same way by

MR. ARONSON:

Well, Your Honor, it is

22

not reasonable to rely on a class action where

23

the -- where the statute of limitations has

24

already expired.

25

If you -- if we enforce a statute of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

12
1

limitations, Rule 23's interests would be

2

served because we would have the classes coming

3

forward early.

4

class who feel they can do a better job than

5

someone else will come forth to the court, make

6

their case, present their class representative,

7

and the court can decide which is the best way

8

to proceed.

9

And those who want to lead the

That's much -- much more efficient but

10

much more in line with Rule 23 than having

11

seriatim shots at trying to get a class

12

certified, which is what we had here.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

18

Counsel -­
Is it -- I'm

sorry.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- I just -- no,

please go ahead.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

My question is,

19

does the reason why the class was denied have

20

any bearing on the rule you're proposing?

21

mean, I see various different potential kinds

22

of reasons.

23

I

Let's say that the plaintiff is

24

inadequate, like happened in the second case

25

here, that there was some collusion between

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

13
1

plaintiff's counsel -- and I -- I'm using a

2

loaded term, but I'm -- more as a

3

hypothetical -- which is the plaintiff isn't

4

representative of the class.

5

a special relationship with counsel.

6

The plaintiff has

Any of those inadequacies of

7

plaintiff's counsel, is that different from a

8

deficiency in pleading in your mind?

9

MR. ARONSON:

It is until you get to

10

the statute of limitations.

11

there's a class-wide defect, that's one thing.

12

And that's what happened in the first class

13

here, where there was a ruling from the court

14

that this case cannot go forward -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, yes, if

Well, all right.

16

So are you saying that if that ruling had been

17

that plaintiff's counsel was inadequate, the

18

former -- the Third Circuit rule, let's call

19

it, that that wouldn't bar a subsequent class

20

action?

21
22
23

MR. ARONSON:

It would if the statute

of limitations had run.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you don't see

24

the reason for the failure of the class to have

25

any bearing on the right of a subsequent class

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

14
1
2

to be formed?
MR. ARONSON:

Not once the -- the

3

statute of limitations has expired.

4

that person who is part of the class who wants

5

to proceed can come forward with his or her

6

individual claim.

7

It'd -­

But if we follow the statute of

8

limitations, again, and we have multiple class

9

actions that are decided at the outset of who's

10

the best lead plaintiff, and something happens

11

-- and -- and they join those cases, whether

12

through consolidation or however they join

13

them, those other people who want to lead the

14

class will be part of this case.

15

So, if something happens with the lead

16

plaintiff, then there's someone else right

17

there who can step right in and say, okay, that

18

lead plaintiff, the lead plaintiff might have

19

died, or something might have happened with the

20

lead plaintiff, there will be others there

21

lining up ready to take over.

22

That's why enforcing the statute of

23

limitations would serve the interests of the

24

class members and serve the interests of Rule

25

23 by having all of this decided at the outset.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Oh, you are,

Official

17

mechanism that -- that is available to everyone

2

who can meet its requirements.

3

MR. ARONSON:

Right.

But Shady Grove

4

is different from Rule -- from -- from this

5

case and equitable tolling in this sense:

6

term, in the CalPERS versus ANZ Securities

7

case, this Court said that the origins of

8

American Pipe tolling do not come from Rule 23.

9

Rule 23 says nothing about statute of

10
11

Last

limitations, tolling, or -- or limitations.
The American Pipe rule comes from

12

traditional principles of equity, and those

13

principles require diligence and extraordinary

14

circumstances.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it seems to me

16

that what you're proposing is that we give

17

preclusive effect, something we've said doesn't

18

exist, to bar named plaintiffs in a second suit

19

to whatever the findings of the court -- prior

20

court were with respect to the class.

that we not expand the intrusion into the

statute of limitations with another court-made

doctrine that we did in American Pipe by saying

now it applies to class actions.

16

justification for that.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And what we're proposing is

There's no

There's no basis.
Well, Mr. Aronson, let

18

me give you a hypothetical.

19

it's one of these class actions where there's

20

actually a very serious wrong and aggregate

21

damages are very high, but each individual

22

person's damages are very low, $32.

23

I mean, suppose

And there's a class certification

24

motion, and let's say in this there is -- that

25

motion is denied for a reason that really has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

27
1

nothing to do with whether this is something

2

that's properly treated by a class action.

3

Let's suppose that, just on the individual

4

facts of the case, this was a bad named

5

plaintiff, not adequate -- not an adequate

6

representative.

7

Your theory would then say:

Okay, so

8

he's dismissed, the statute of limitations has

9

run because these things take a long time, and

10

then all these people with extremely valid

11

claims, claims that we would want to be brought

12

in order to force defendants to internalize the

13

costs of their illegal behavior, well, too bad,

14

that just can't go forward.

15

MR. ARONSON:

Under our theory, if you

16

enforce the statute of limitations and announce

17

that we have a statute of limitations, we're

18

not going to allow all of this back-end

19

maneuvering, then people will step forward so

20

that if there's a problem -­

21
22
23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

They all have claims

that are $32 claims.
MR. ARONSON:

Well, 30 -- you know,

24

people have $32 claims and they have to make a

25

decision as to whether or not they want to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

28
1
2

pursue the $32 million -- $32 claims.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that is the entire

3

purpose of our -- of -- of Rule 23, is that we

4

understand that with respect to some category

5

of claims, we're not going to have them

6

individually or it will be so ridiculous if we

7

have them individually that we would prefer the

8

class action device.

9

MR. ARONSON:

If it works.

But if the

10

class action device doesn't work, then the -­

11

then the individuals have their own claims.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but, again,

13

here, it's not working just for some reason

14

that has nothing to do with the appropriateness

15

of class treatment; it just has to do with the

16

fact that one named plaintiff is not a good

17

named plaintiff.

18

MR. ARONSON:

Right.

And if -- if we

19

have all of these cases up front by enforcing a

20

statute of limitations and requiring anyone who

21

wants to lead the class, and, hopefully, there

22

will be more than one and not others sitting

23

back and waiting for the statute of limitations

24

to -- to expire, but coming up forward and

25

something happens with the class representative

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

29
1

that you mentioned, there will be someone else

2

waiting there because they will have filed

3

their claims early, they would have been part

4

of that case and can step forward, and they

5

could fix that.

6

And even if the statute had run and if

7

they were part of the case, then it would

8

relate back, so the statute of limitations

9

would not be an issue -­

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In -- in that

14

instance, is there ever an amended complaint

not in the initial class action.

21

22

you'll have -- you won't have this problem,

23

because you'll have other class representatives

24

ready to go and can step right up and they will

25

have been part of the litigation.

So it's the -- it's the -- the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

counsel.
Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
I'd like to start with the question

18

that you posed and the one that Justice Gorsuch

19

posed about the application of Rule 23.

20

Petitioner concedes that every individual class

21

member had a timely claim at the time the

22

second class certification motion was denied.

23

That concession means that you have to consider

24

whether or not there is some exception to the

25

notion that all of the Rules of Civil Procedure

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

31
1

apply.

2

In the Shady Grove case, this Court

3

held that if an application for class

4

certification is made under Rule 23, it applies

5

automatically if the conditions for Rule 23 are

6

satisfied.

7

Procedure, Civil Procedure Rule Number 1 says

8

it applies to "all civil actions."

9

So, under the Rules of Civil

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

So -­

But -- but, Mr. -­

Well, I don't think

11

they -- I don't think they made that

12

concession.

13

characterization of their argument.

14

don't know whether I agree with their argument

15

or not, but I don't think that's the -- that's

16

the argument.

17

I don't think that's a fair
And I -- I

The argument is basically this:

18

You've got a statute of limitations.

19

courts have to follow it, like it or not.

20

how does a court justify allowing somebody to

21

file a claim after the statute of limitations

22

has run?

23

The
Now

And the theory, they say, is that

24

there was this old doctrine of equitable

25

tolling, and when Congress enacted the statute

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

32
1

of limitations, it did so with the

2

understanding that it would be subject to the

3

doctrine of equitable tolling.

4

So, in order to allow the -- the case

5

-- the claim to be filed after the statute of

6

limitations has run, it has to fit within the

7

doctrine of equitable tolling.

8

tolling requires diligence and extraordinary

9

circumstances.

10

And equitable

So you have to show that those are

11

present in the case where a new class action is

12

filed after the -- the expiration of the

13

statute of limitations.

14

If -- if, you know -- if you proceed

15

from the assumption that their -- they -- that

16

all of the members of the class had claims that

17

were equitably tolled for all purposes, then,

18

of course, your argument is a good one, but

19

they don't proceed on the basis of that.

20

is not -- they do not concede that premise.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

That

Well, the second class

22

action here, Smyth, was filed within the

23

statute of limitations period, so I think you

24

have to confront the question of the logic that

25

Justice Kagan's questions pose, which is why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

33
1

doesn't the same diligence and extraordinary

2

circumstances that applied in the first timely

3

filed class action also apply in the second

4

timely filed class action?

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well -- well, that's

6

true, Mr. Frederick, but I had the same

7

question that Justice Alito had because let's

8

assume, just for the sake of argument, and you

9

can tell by my questions I'm a little bit

10

skeptical of this, but let's assume that the

11

interests were different.

12

about Rule 23, about the Rules Enabling Act,

13

about Shady Grove, about Tyson, do -- is that

14

an argument that applies even if you think that

15

we're in a different world with respect to

16

diligence and exceptional circumstances?

17

MR. FREDERICK:

Is your argument

It would, although I

18

think that it is fair to say that this Court's

19

decisions, including last term in ANZ and

20

CalPERS, described the American Pipe rule as a

21

different form of judicial equitable power

22

designed to enforce the principles behind Rule

23

23 and to promote judicial efficiency in the

24

adjudication of individual claims.

25

And that's why in the Menominee

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

34
1

decision the Court distinguished between "class

2

action tolling" and the type of equitable

3

tolling that arose in Holland for individual

4

claims where you have to look at both due

5

diligence and extraordinary circumstances.

6

And I would think that the way you

7

synthesize and rationalize these principles is

8

that you say the American Pipe rule does

9

satisfy those classic instances of due

10

diligence and extraordinary circumstances, but

11

they do it in a somewhat different way because

12

we are trying to incentivize people not to

13

bring duplicative claims.

14

That was the whole driver behind the

15

American Pipe rule to begin with.

16

extraordinary circumstance.

17

then about due diligence is, do you look at due

18

diligence before or after the case was filed?

19

That's the

And the question

Classically, under equitable

20

principles, you looked at what was the due

21

diligence of the person before the case was

22

filed.

23

Here, the idea is that a class member

24

who is an absent class member is exercising the

25

due diligence by relying on the American Pipe

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

35
1

rule.

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

3

And that's pretty -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

Exactly.

All right.

What about after -­

I'm sorry.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm sorry, and

7

that's pretty unusual, right?

I can't think of

8

another example in equitable tolling doctrine

9

where we do this, which may suggest some

10

question about whether American Pipe is

11

correct.

12

And if we have doubts about that, why

13

should we extend it so radically here in a way

14

that was unforeseen even by the authors of

15

American Pipe?

16

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, you're not

17

extending it, Justice Gorsuch, and the reason

18

you're not extending it is because, if a claim

19

is a timely-filed individual claim, all of the

20

reasons to deny, encouraging and incentivizing

21

duplicative multiple -- multiple claims, those

22

all apply.

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm sorry -- I'm

24

sorry to interrupt, but -- but if -- if we

25

doubt those rationales, if we doubt American

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

36
1

Pipe and think that it doesn't really represent

2

true equitable tolling principles at common

3

law, why would we extend that?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, you wouldn't -­

5

again, you would not be extending that.

6

think you would be doing is to say, as Mr.

7

Aronson, I think, has acknowledged, that the

8

individual claims are timely under his reading

9

and his understanding, and then the question is

10
11

What I

-JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But only on the

12

understanding of American Pipe that it's after

13

the fact rather than before the fact.

14

the difference, I guess.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

That's

And that is an

16

expansion -- what he's proposing is an

17

expansion on the idea of what due diligence is,

18

because you don't classically look at due

19

diligence after a case has been filed.

20

You look at what was the plaintiff

21

doing before the case was filed.

22

that extent, he is asking for an expansion from

23

what the common law understanding of equity was

24

in the determination of equitable tolling.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And so, to

I guess I'm not -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Frederick,

2

there's one thing I find very puzzling about

3

your argument.

4

Grove.

5

That is your reliance on Shady

Rule 23 says nothing about tolling.

6

Tolling is, as you have said, an equitable

7

doctrine.

8

Courts decide if there is tolling, how long the

9

tolling will be.

10

Tolling is made up by courts.

They're not -- tolling questions are

11

not resolved by the federal rules.

12

tolling is court-made law, not rule-made law.

13

MR. FREDERICK:

Equitable

Justice Ginsburg, it

14

is correct that Shady Grove did not address

15

tolling.

16

Grove, however, that if a plaintiff has a

17

timely claim, which we assert has been conceded

18

here for individual claims, then the Rules of

19

Civil Procedure apply automatically and all of

20

the rules apply.

We distilled the principle from Shady

21

He's acknowledged, I think today, that

22

Rule 20 and Rule 24 apply, so that intervention

23

and joinder can occur, and the question is,

24

what is the principle of equity that says Rule

25

23 doesn't apply?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

38

JUSTICE BREYER:

He says it's, I

2

think, I think, and I don't want to put words

3

in his mouth, but I think let us focus on

4

someone like me, a common person.

5

is you sit home, you go to your office, and one

6

day this complicated letter comes, and it says:

7

There is a class action being filed, did you

8

buy some pencils from so and so during a period

9

of time?

And if so, you are entitled to some

10

damages.

And do you know what I do about that?

11

Nothing.

It tells me I have a right to opt

12

out.

13

Nothing.

What you do

Do I finish reading it?

All right.

No.

Now think of people who

14

are like that.

15

letter came in plenty of time to file a suit.

16

Then there was a class action.

17

dismissed.

18

Now what happens is that first

Then it got

Then some individual people filed

19

because they were tolled.

20

Let's look back to that common person there.

21

You know what he did the second time?

22

Did he read the letter?

23

in the wastebasket?

24

All right.

25

Now he's saying:

No.

Nothing.

Did he throw it

Probably.
So, as to that, he is

saying, it is not equitable to give that person

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

39
1

who didn't even read the letter a second chance

2

again to be a person who didn't read the

3

letter.

4
5

I think -- I think that's something
like what the argument is.

6

MR. FREDERICK:

And I think that the

7

answer to that was actually addressed by the

8

principal drafter or reporter of Rule 23 when

9

it was amended in 1966.

Professor Benjamin

10

Kaplan, who was the reporter, had a very long

11

article, which this Court has cited, I think,

12

nine times, in the Harvard Law Review in 1967.

13

And what he explained was that the

14

reason for this change, in part, was to address

15

the situation of the small claim of the small

16

person.

17

Those were his words, not mine.
But the idea behind bringing a

18

representative action was the idea that if you

19

had what would be a small value claim, you had

20

the ability to aggregate those claims by the

21

filing of your class action.

22

allowed that.

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And Rule 23

I don't think

24

anybody questions the importance of that -­

25

that function of the rule.

I think the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

40
1

question that Justice Breyer is getting at, and

2

I guess I am too in a way, is can you stack

3

them forever, so that try, try again, and that

4

the statute of limitations never really has any

5

force in these cases.

6

that, given the congressional judgment that

7

there should be a statute of limitations?

8
9

What do we do about

And what restraints might there be
if -- if not the ones that your friend proposes

10

that the Ninth Circuit suggested, for example,

11

that class action attorneys would exercise

12

restraint.

13

Should we rely on that?

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Gorsuch, I

14

would have a couple of responses to your

15

question.

16

the answer, that the repose period is the outer

17

limit.

In the securities context, we know

18

For cases where there is no repose

19

period, what the Ninth Circuit proposed and

20

suggested was that the principle of comity is

21

the most powerful mechanism for limiting the -­

22

any concern that there might be about serial

23

class certification motions.

24
25

We know from Smith versus Bayer that
the first denial of a class certification is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

41
1

not issue or claim preclusive.

2

question is, what respect does the second court

3

apply when the same class is brought forward

4

with the same claims?

5

So then the

There are multiple cases in the

6

district courts that have dealt with this very

7

issue outside of statutory contexts where there

8

is a repose period.

9

41 and 42 of our brief in Note 9.

10

We've cited them on pages

I would point the Court in particular

11

to a case called Winco Foods, where Judge

12

Breyer in the California district court has

13

noted that there is -- it is relatively easy

14

for a district judge to determine whether the

15

same rationale would apply to deny the second

16

class certification motion as the first.

17

There's another decision called Ott,

18

which we cite in that footnote, and there the

19

district court looked very carefully at what

20

were multiple subclasses and said one of them

21

the same rationale would apply.

22

not allowed to be brought.

23
24
25

That one is

A second one, the same rationale would
not apply.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's preclusion

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

42
1

but not calling it preclusion, if you're saying

2

we look at the two class actions, if the second

3

one is the same as the first, we're not going

4

to allow it, but we'll call it comity instead

5

of preclusion.

6

Is that -­

MR. FREDERICK:

No, it's not

7

preclusion, Justice Ginsburg.

8

comity in the sense that the rationale has to

9

be the same.

10

It really is

So here we know in our case the first

11

class certification motion was denied because

12

the lawyer and his expert made a foot fault.

13

They were unable to come up with the requisites

14

of the fraud on the market reliance theory, a

15

problem that was corrected in the second case,

16

the Smyth case, where the evidence was so

17

overwhelming to meet the fraud on the market

18

presumption that the other side did not put in

19

any contrary evidence.

20

And so the question here really is are

21

you going to deny what is undoubtedly a

22

meritorious fraud by a company that was

23

delisted from the NASDAQ stock exchange by the

24

SEC for completely cooking the books because

25

the claims that are being brought are by small

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

43
1

value claims that are seeking to aggregate

2

them.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, you're -­

4

you're going to deny it because the claims are

5

filed outside the statute of limitations.

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Your Honor,

7

respectfully, the Smyth case was filed inside

8

the statute of limitations.

9

question is, why would you apply a different

And so the

10

equitable principle for tolling to the second

11

one as opposed to the first one?

12
13
14

And, here, what everybody I think has
acknowledged -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Because they slept

15

on their rights once, it's okay, but they can't

16

sleep on their rights twice.

17

MR. FREDERICK:

I think that the

18

question in equity, Justice Kennedy, is whether

19

or not -- there are two questions.

20

equity allow the Court to say you can apply

21

certain Rules of Civil Procedure in one setting

22

but not in another because equitably we say so.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

One is does

Do you -- perhaps -­

24

all right.

So your response is, if I

25

understand this correctly, to my worry I said,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

44
1

well, I sit up in the -- you know, with my

2

pencils and whatever, and I sit up in the attic

3

and I never read my mail and -- and dah, dah,

4

dah, and you can bring the class action, and I

5

get rewarded even though I've never really done

6

much of anything, and I've done it.

7

And you say:

Well, why does that

8

solve -- why do -- why does my claim survive

9

the running of the statute of limitations?

And

10

your response to that is, well, you behaved no

11

worse the second time than you did the first

12

time and that the reasons for giving you this

13

reward are exactly the same, they are no

14

different, because it really had nothing to do

15

with time.

16

of allowing small claims to be recognized.

17

I have that correct?

18

It had to do with the desirability

MR. FREDERICK:

Do

Well, I -- I think

19

that the problem about the incentives is

20

misunderstanding what the representative action

21

that's being brought in a class action is

22

designed to do.

It's intended to say in this

23

kind of context:

I have a low-value claim.

24

my claim individually were to proceed, I

25

probably would spend more on lawyers than I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If

Official

45
1
2

would be able to recover.
And that's why Rule 23 provides, as a

3

representative matter, that you can aggregate

4

these claims in order to make sure that the

5

low-value -­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. FREDERICK:

8
9

They are.
-- claims are all

brought together.
JUSTICE BREYER:

10

MR. FREDERICK:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

So you're saying -­
And -­
You're saying that,

12

and his -- his -- what they have to show is,

13

well, why is it worse the second time than it

14

was the first time?

15

MR. FREDERICK:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

MR. FREDERICK:

And what -­
Is that right?
Yes.

But what the

18

courts have said -- what the courts have said

19

is that the reason -- this Court in particular

20

in Crown, Cork and American Pipe -- is we want

21

to avoid having duplicative filings.

22

I mean, one solution to the issue that

23

you're surfacing through your various questions

24

is that multiple class action cases get filed,

25

and then the district court is dealing with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

46
1

what are a large number of filings in a

2

procedurally complex matter to determine which

3

class action ought to be the one to rise to the

4

top.

5

And you're having exactly the same

6

problem this Court asked to avoid.

In

7

Petrobras, which the National Council -­

8

National Conference of Public Employment

9

Retirement Systems' brief on page 7 points out

10

that there were 500 protective filings in the

11

Petrobras Securities Litigation.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, one

13

reason that the second might be different -­

14

might be different than the first, because if

15

you allow the second, you've got to allow the

16

third and then the fourth and the fifth.

17

there's no end in sight.

18

MR. FREDERICK:

And

And what judges have

19

held, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the end in

20

sight is that you have to have a new rationale

21

for why the subsequent class certification

22

motion should be granted.

23

-- and they get denied fairly routinely, and

24

they get denied across the broad spectrum of

25

the statutory claims that people bring.

And they get denied

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

47
1

And that is the empirical truth of it.

2

And it is a solution that this Court in Smith

3

identified as the mechanism because this Court

4

could have cut this off at Smith several years

5

ago by simply saying:

You only get one shot at

6

class certification.

But the Court unanimously

7

held no, because it is not preclusive against

8

the absent members.

9

rationale with the idea that if there is

And if you apply that

10

tolling, you have the chance for a meritorious

11

class.

12

Here, we had the situation where,

13

because of inadequate representation

14

functionally, a class of what would have been a

15

very meritorious claim -- set of claims against

16

this company that had committed fraud is

17

basically being foreclosed because of the

18

inability to bring high-value claims on an

19

individual basis or to have adequate counsel

20

who can properly construct a securities class

21

action.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

You -- you argue that

23

if the second -- let's say class certification

24

is denied in the first case.

25

case is brought.

Then a second

And the new district judge

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

48
1

doesn't -- just says, well, I just think the

2

first district judge was wrong and I don't care

3

about -- I know -- I'm not going to accept that

4

as a matter of comity.

5

Is there any remedy for that?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, I think, Justice

7

Alito, I've not encountered that in the cases.

8

What frequently happens is that these

9

subsequent cases get related and transferred

10

back as related cases under various MDL

11

procedures, but I think the answer to your

12

question would be resolved under a -- abuse of

13

discretion standard, and the issue on appeal

14

would be:

15

comity on the -- on the basis that the same

16

rationale applied?

17

argument and that would be how a court of

18

appeals would review that.

19

Should the second judge have applied

I think that would be the

JUSTICE ALITO:

I -- I've never seen

20

this as an enforceable -- you know, as an

21

enforceable doctrine.

22

district judge would be perfectly right in

23

saying:

24

independently.

25

consideration to what the first judge did, but

I would think the second

Look, I have to apply the law
And I'll give respectful

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

49
1

if the first judge was wrong, I'm not going to

2

follow what the first -­

3

MR. FREDERICK:

And that's why -­

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- judge did.

5

MR. FREDERICK:

I think that -- and

6

that's why it is under an abuse of discretion

7

standard, because one would be looking at, did

8

the district court abuse the discretion vested

9

to him or her in that circumstance?

10

But I would point out that I'm not

11

aware of where these kinds of cases get

12

appealed and brought up.

13

of the point that Justice Gorsuch raised from

14

the Ninth Circuit opinion, which is that

15

attorneys who are bringing these cases tend not

16

to bring them if they are not going to succeed,

17

here, we have a situation where, because of the

18

default by the attorney, there is a meritorious

19

case.

20

been properly brought.

21

whether or not the time ran out.

And precisely because

It should have been certified had it
And the question is

22

And that leads me -­

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if we -- if we

24

were to rule against you, it seems to me the

25

effect might be that we would encourage more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

50
1

protective filings, and that would solve the

2

problem, wouldn't it?

3

create these extraordinary rules in extending

4

American Pipe in new ways; we'd just create a

5

new incentive structure that would ensure that

6

there are backup class actions available.

7

-- what's wrong with that?

8
9

We wouldn't have to

MR. FREDERICK:

What

I think that what's

wrong with that is that it is inconsistent with

10

what led the Court to the American Pipe

11

principle to begin with, which was that this

12

was really a balancing among a multiplicity of

13

interests.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And -- and we're now

15

balancing a multiplicity of interests in a

16

slightly different context.

17

the balance with respect to encouraging

18

protective filings might be slightly different

19

here?

20

MR. FREDERICK:

And why wouldn't

I think that the

21

answer is that one of the rationales of the

22

American Pipe rule was to protect district

23

judges from having to do a lot of unnecessary

24

work in processing both individual and

25

protective class action claims and to do a lot

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

51
1

of things that have to be done as an

2

administrative matter that's unnecessary if you

3

recognize the representative nature of the

4

class action that is filed.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -­
The alternative is

6

backhand administration over comity questions

7

that are effectively unreviewable.

8

MR. FREDERICK:

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

10

Well -­
So how do we weigh

those two interests?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

I -- I don't agree

12

that these are comity questions that are

13

unreviewable.

14

transfer -­

15

And, of course, where you have

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Are you aware of any

16

court that's ever held that a district court

17

abused its discretion in -- in -- in declining

18

to follow another district court's decision?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

No, but I'm also not

20

aware of any decision of a court that says that

21

just because you have an equitable tolling of

22

an individual claim, you can't use all of the

23

Rules of Civil Procedure that are available to

24

you.

25

some extent, Justice Gorsuch.

I mean, we are in uncharted waters to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

52
1

But I think that the first instinct of

2

the American Pipe Court, as reaffirmed in

3

Crown, Cork, was to say that the tolling

4

applied to "all class members."

5

when -­

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And remember,

But in -- in the -­

7

the underlying idea, I thought, of American

8

Pipe, was class action denied, anyone can come

9

in in a window after that, they are diligent,

10

but the class members that have done nothing,

11

that are sitting tossing the notices into the

12

wastepaper basket, they -- they are not

13

diligent.

14

So American Pipe is protecting

15

diligent parties who will come in immediately

16

after the class action is denied, and the ones

17

who don't come in are still sleeping on their

18

rights.

19

MR. FREDERICK:

Right.

But the second

20

subsequent class action here, Smyth, would

21

satisfy the diligence rationale.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, that -- that

23

one case, Smyth was within the statute of

24

limitations.

25

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official

53
1

so -­

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MR. FREDERICK:

This one isn't.

That's correct, but

4

the rationale, the logic of it applies in the

5

same way.

6

Justice Ginsburg, to say that the Court in

7

Crown, Cork was talking about diligence.

8

Remember that in both American Pipe and in

9

Crown, Cork, the class certification denials

And it's not correct, I don't think,

10

were done because the class certification could

11

not meet the requisites of Rule 23(a), and that

12

meant that there was not going to be a

13

possibility of a class in those factual

14

circumstances.

15

to suppose that what -­

16

So it would have been natural

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, there could

17

have been people who were worried about the -­

18

the weaknesses, the vulnerability of the class

19

representative could have intervened in that -­

20

in that action.

21

the class action was denied.

22

They didn't have to wait until

MR. FREDERICK:

The -- and, Justice

23

Ginsburg, that goes to my point, which is that

24

equity should not allow the courts to pick and

25

choose which Rules of Civil Procedure apply if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

54
1

you have a timely filed claim.

2

You know, the principle here that I

3

think has been important is the idea that the

4

procedural rules shouldn't matter.

5

ends up happening is that the Petitioner's

6

position has particularly harsh results because

7

the defendant has much more control over the

8

running of the statute of limitations.

9

And what

Here, both the Dean case and the Smyth

10

case were settled through individual

11

settlements.

12

that a defendant who did not want to face a

13

follow-on class action would simply wait until

14

one day after the statute of limitations has

15

expired and the class certification motion has

16

not been acted on yet, will simply buy off the

17

lead plaintiff and know that it will never face

18

a class action.

19

So, if you were to hypothesize

And -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Frederick,

20

there's been a circuit split, I see it as three

21

ways.

22

Circuits have basically followed your

23

adversary's rule.

24

there's a deficiency in the plaintiff, they

25

will permit a follow-on class action but

The First, Second, Fifth, and Eleventh

The Third and Eighth say if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

55
1

otherwise, no.

2

And I'm assuming that that's the rule

3

you should -- you would like here to say:

4

Smith, it was a timely class action.

5

deficiency was in the plaintiff, not in my

6

claim.

7

In

The only

And so you would win here.
And in the Ninth and I think the Ninth

8

and the Sixth, and somebody else has -- have

9

followed the rule you're trying to advocate

10

for.

11

a little bit and tell me if we're thinking of

12

doing what your adversary says, why shouldn't

13

we accept that compromise?

14

Go back to the Third and Eighth argument

MR. FREDERICK:

I think that the

15

compromise position would certainly solve the

16

problem in this case because of the -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. FREDERICK:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. FREDERICK:

For you.

For me.
Yeah.

So leaving that aside,

21

I think that if you were to do that, you would

22

affirm on a separate basis, but the judgment of

23

the Ninth Circuit would be upheld and the case

24

would be timely and allowed to go forward.

25

I think that the -- the principal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

56
1

difficulty from it as a doctrinal matter is

2

that the Court has not tended to use these

3

types of equitable arguments as a way of having

4

Rule 23 operate as a toggle on and off switch.

5

And that, I think, is where you have a certain

6

amount of analytical difficulty.

7

The way we have proposed the solution

8

to this case is if the claim is timely and it's

9

timely as an individual matter, the individual

10

can bring in, under Rule 23, that is a very

11

straightforward, clean, simple rule.

12

So, if you were to then look at, say,

13

we don't accept the simple rule, we want to

14

have something a little bit more complex, I

15

think at the very least you would say:

16

plaintiff who brought that adequate to

17

represent the class and was there a deficiency

18

in the adequacy of that representation?

19

Was the

And I think to that extent, you would

20

then have to look hard at what were the various

21

factors that went into that adequacy.

22

becomes a much more complicated question when I

23

think, as the Court has told us, we want these

24

timing rules generally to be simple and

25

straightforward so that litigants know how to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official

57
1

follow them.

2

But certainly, as a matter of equity,

3

it does not seem fair where you're talking

4

about a rule that is allowing potentially

5

meritorious claims to go forward to be snuffed

6

out simply because the person who got to the

7

courthouse first happened not to be competent

8

in bringing about the kind of case that would

9

be representative of all of the various

10

plaintiffs.

11
12

Unless the Court has any further
questions, we'll submit.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SETH ARONSON

17
18

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ARONSON:

Let me begin by saying

19

that we have not conceded that all of the

20

absent shareholders' claims are timely.

21

are not timely.

22

they have not come forward.

23

They

They are not timely because

Mr. Resh's individual claim is timely

24

because he showed the diligence by filing an

25

action, and these extraordinary circumstances

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

58
1

existed beforehand where he should not have

2

filed that action.

3

But as to absent class members, they

4

have not shown any diligence, they have not

5

stepped forward to file anything, and there are

6

no extraordinary circumstances because the

7

class has been denied.

8
9

And we're not saying that Mr. Resh is
not able to use Rule 23.

He can.

But what he

10

cannot do is use Rule 23 to revive claims that

11

have been dormant, that are not timely.

12

what he can't do with Rule 23.

13

That's

But if he wants to come into court and

14

say:

15

no one else in that class, because they have

16

not filed their -- they're not entitled to

17

equitable tolling.

18

I've got a Rule 23 claim, fine, there's

Let me also address what Justice Alito

19

and Justice Gorsuch identified on comity.

20

illustrate how weak comity is as a defense is

21

-- we asked the judge in Smyth, who was the

22

same judge in Dean, we couldn't say you're

23

precluded because Smyth was filed in a timely

24

way, so we could not use preclusion under Smith

25

versus Bayer, so we said we'd like you to show

Heritage Reporting Corporation

To

Official

59
1

comity.

2

deference to himself.

3

other judges to show deference to other judges?

4

That's how -­

5

The district judge wouldn't even show
So how can we expect

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I thought that

6

that was because the problem that he identified

7

had been cured.

8
9

MR. ARONSON:
it had not been cured.

It had not been -- well,
He thought that -- that

10

Smyth might be able to do it in a different way

11

and then threw out Smyth because of adequacy

12

and typicality grounds.

13
14
15

But -- but we asked for comity, and we
didn't get it from the same judge.
And, Justice Kagan, you earlier

16

remarked that American Pipe says that the class

17

members are diligent for relying on the class.

18

Yes, but up to a point.

19

Crown, Cork.

20

And let me read from

And I'm reading from 103 Supreme Court

21

at 2397 to 98.

"We conclude, as did the Court

22

in American Pipe, that the commencement of a

23

class action suspends the applicable statute of

24

limitations as to all members of the class who

25

would have been parties had the suit been

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official

60

determined to continue as a class action.

2

the statute of limitations has been tolled, it

3

remains tolled for all members of the putative

4

class until certification is denied.

5

point, class members may choose to file their

6

own suits or to intervene as plaintiffs in the

7

pending action."

At that

So reliance on the class action
alone -- on -- on the class action itself is
not enough.

You have to do something else.

Counsel said that he's okay with

12

getting tolling from one of the class actions

13

but not the both -- but not both.

14

the math, they filed so late that Respondents

15

need tolling from both cases.

16

If you do

So, if you rule that he's not entitled

17

to tolling in the first case because it was on

18

a class-wide basis, then their claims are

19

time-barred under any standard.

20

But let me go back to the -- the basic

21

point that we're trying to make here by

22

enforcing the statute of limitations.

23

that if -- if class members get in there early,

24

class representatives apply early, it solves

25

all of these problems.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We think

Official

1

It solves the problem, Justice Kagan,

2

of the $32 claimant.

3

this will have -- this will enhance Rule 23

4

because the best class representatives will be

5

there early.

6

to make the best decision early on.

7

That person -- this -­

The district judge will be able

And if we have multiple class actions,

8

fine.

The driver of American Pipe was not

9

multiple class actions.

American Pipe and

10

Crown, Cork said we don't want all these

11

individual actions while we're trying to deal

12

with class issues.

13

Dealing with more class issues, better

14

class representatives, we think that's a good

15

thing.

16

does the same thing for us.

We think that the PSLRA, for example,

17

So I have to remark that in -- in

18

Crown, Cork at the end, in -- in Justice

19

Powell's closing concurrence, he said that

20

American Pipe gives us a very generous rule and

21

it invites abuse.

22

litigation of class actions is that abuse.

23
24
25

And we think that serial

We ask that the court below be
reversed.

Thank you.
