ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. CROOKS:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case arises on direct review of the first

10
11

Federal death sentence imposed under the Federal Death

12

Penalty Act of 1994.
Of critical importance in this case is the fact

13
14

that the FDPA is a weighing statute in which jurors are

15

required to weigh any statutory and non-statutory

16

aggravating factors they find against any mitigating

17

factors.

18

In this case, the court of appeals found that

19

two of the four aggravating factors found by the jury were

20

constitutionally invalid, but then held that that error

21

was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

22

The court of appeals erred in concluding that

23

this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because

24

if the two invalid aggravating circumstances are removed

25

from the mix altogether in this weighing jurisdiction,

1

this record simply cannot support a finding of harmless

2

error beyond a reasonable doubt.

3

reasons why this is so.

4

There are several

First and foremost, there was an unusually

5

powerful case in mitigation presented here.

This

6

petitioner had a stellar military record, including 22

7

years of service in the United States Army as an Army

8

Airborne Ranger.

9

was decorated extensively.

He served in two foreign conflicts and

10

Furthermore, jurors in this case found that this

11

petitioner, unlike many or most capital defendants, had no

12

significant prior criminal record.

13

Jurors also found that at the time of the

14

offense the petitioner was laboring under severe mental or

15

emotional disturbance, duress and stress, and impaired

16

capacity.

17

And the jurors also took the extraordinary step

18

of writing in as a mitigating factor the name, Sandy Lane,

19

who was petitioner's ex-wife, thereby indicating they

20

believed that the break-up of petitioner's marriage with

21

Ms. Lane was in some degree a mitigating factor for this

22

offense.

23

It is also significant to look at the

24

aggravating factors in this case which the jury did not

25

find.

The jury rejected fully three of the seven

1

aggravating factors submitted by the Government.

2

did not find that this offense was committed as the result

3

of substantial planning and premeditation.

4

not find that the petitioner had created a grave risk of

5

death to someone else besides the victim, and

6

significantly the jury did not find that the petitioner

7

would be a future danger.

8

QUESTION:

The jury

The jury did

Were the objections that -- the

9

instructions, rather, that you're talking about now, Mr.

10

Crooks -- were those objected to by the respondent -- by

11

the petitioner?

12

MR. CROOKS:

13

It is also significant to look at --

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Yes, they were, Your Honor.

On the express grounds of overlap or

being duplicative?
MR. CROOKS:

I don't recall whether there was an

17

express objection at trial on the grounds of duplication,

18

but definitely there was an objection on the grounds of

19

vagueness and overbreadth.

20

QUESTION:

Those are certainly the kinds of

21

things that the prosecution could argue to the jury, and

22

so this had the effect of focusing the jury's attention on

23

a certain area.

24

too imprecise for eligibility, but -- but this is the

25

second stage, selection.

I would -- I would think they would be

MR. CROOKS:

1

This evidence is,

indeed,

2

admissible, Your Honor, as the Court pointed out in Payne,

3

but the problem here is that this is a weighing

4

jurisdiction.

5

it's especially important that aggravating factors in a

6

weighing jurisdiction be defined with some degree of

7

precision.

8

these factors were too vague and overbroad for use in a

9

weighing jurisdiction.

0

And as the Court pointed out in Stringer,

And as the court of appeals correctly held,

QUESTION:

Does the Government concede that the

court of appeals was right in saying those two factors
2

were invalid?

3

MR. CROOKS:

4

QUESTION:

It does not, Your Honor.
It doesn't now, but it did in its

5

brief in opposition to the cert petition, didn't it?

6

didn't raise any question about the aggravating

7

circumstances.

8

QUESTION:

It

Well, that's not the same thing as -

9
20

MR. CROOKS:

2

QUESTION:

Yes.

22

QUESTION:

So, we -- we take the case on the

That's correct, Your Honor.

23

assumption that they were -- they were properly found to

24

-- to -- to have been erroneously submitted to the jury.

25

MR. CROOKS:

That is certainly our position,

1

Your Honor.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. CROOKS:

Yes.
As the court of appeals noted,

4

these factors failed to distinguish this homicide from any

5

other because every victim has a background and every

6

victim has personal characteristics.

7

submitting these factors to the jury, the Government

8

stacked the deck because the jury could not help but find

9

these factors as they were worded, and once the jury found

Therefore, by

10

those factors, in this weighing jurisdiction it was

11

required to weigh those factors on death's side of the

12

scale.

13

As the court of appeals also noted, the mere use

14

of terms like background and personal characteristics,

15

without any further instruction, which there was not in

16

this case, leave the jury with precisely the type of open-

17

ended discretion this Court condemned in Furman v.

18

Georgia.

19

circumstances -- had they been removed, it cannot be said

20

beyond a reasonable doubt that the result would have been

21

the same in this case.

22

In fact, the two invalid aggravating

QUESTION:

Well, supposing that we -- we don't

23

agree with the Fifth Circuit, that those -- those factors

24

were invalid, are you prepared to argue that they were?

25

MR. CROOKS:

We are prepared to argue that they

1

are invalid, Your Honor.

2

hold that they were both vague and overbroad and also

3

duplicative because these factors are present in every

4

homicide.
QUESTION:

5

The Fifth Circuit did correctly

But if -- if -- if you can -- if

6

Payne says you can put in victim evidence, in a sense

7

that's true, every victim is going to have some sort of

8

background, but isn't that exactly what Payne means?
MR. CROOKS:

9

Payne does mean that the jury may

10

hear about evidence of the victim's characteristics and

11

the effect on the survivors, but we're not arguing that

12

Payne should be overruled.

13

a weighing jurisdiction, the factors must be defined with

14

some degree of precision and they can't be vague and

15

overbroad, and the jury's discretion must be channeled in

16

an appropriate way for a weighing jurisdiction.

17

QUESTION:

What we're arguing is that in

It would seem to me to be very

18

difficult to design mitigating factors for submission to

19

the jury that had no overlap.
MR. CROOKS:

20

I don't believe that's true, Your

21

Honor.

I think that the Government could and, in fact,

22

did in its brief, make an attempt to draft -- redraft

23

factors 3(B) and 3(C) in a fashion that would not be

24

vague, overbroad, or duplicative, but the very extent to

25

which the Government had to rewrite those factors in order

1

to make them even attempt to pass constitutional muster

2

highlights the problems with the factors which were

3

actually submitted to this jury.
QUESTION:

4

Are you suggesting that perhaps the

5

statutory aggravators are models because they certainly

6

are discrete, the statutory aggravators?

7

MR. CROOKS:

8

QUESTION:

9

I'm sorry, Your Honor.
The statutory aggravators are

discrete, one from another.

They're not overlapping as

10

these two.

So, if those are the models for what

11

additional aggravators are, models of the extent of

12

precision and clarity, I suppose that that would support

13

the Eleventh Circuit's view.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CROOKS:

Fifth Circuit.
That would be correct, Your Honor.

16

The statutory aggravators certainly highlight the problems

17

that are present in these non-statutory aggravators

18

because the statutory aggravators are worded a good bit

19

more clearly and give much more direction to the jury than

20

these factors 3(B) and 3(C) that the Government drafted.

21

QUESTION:

How is that?

That is, what I'm

22

having trouble in my own mind -- I take it it's

23

constitutional.

24

aggravator as heinous -- what is the words, you know --

25

heinous, cruel, and depraved, which is a little vague, but

It's perfectly okay to have a statutory

1

I see the point.
But then why can't it be a statutory factor

2

3

where you'd think of whether the -- the victim is

4

vulnerable?

5

young age or -- you know, they go through.

6

age, slight stature, her background, and unfamiliarity

7

with the region.

8

precise.

9

And here what makes her vulnerable is her
They say young

That seems more precise, not less

I mean, I -- I'm not taking a view one way or

10

the other, but I'd like -- just looking at it directly, I

11

read those three words, heinous, depraved, et cetera, and

12

then I compare it to the four rather precise things that

13

have to do with the victim.

14

argument that that's vaguer rather than more precise?

15

MR. CROOKS:

Why is the -- what's your

First, Your Honor, I think it's

16

significant that the statutory aggravator, heinous, cruel,

17

and depraved, doesn't just stop at the words heinous,

18

cruel, and depraved, but goes on to tie that definition to

19

torture and makes it more specific than just the words

20

heinous, cruei, and depraved, which under this Court's

21

decisions in Godfrey and Maynard v. Cartwright might,

22

indeed, pose a problem.

23

But what was problematic with the non-statutory

24

aggravators is that whether or not it might have been

25

permissible to tie the petitioner's culpability to the
10

1

special vulnerability of the victim, the aggravators as

2

submitted, the non-statutory aggravators, did not do that.

3

They simply required the jury to find her age, her

4

background, her slight stature, and her youth and, once

5

having found them, to treat that factor as aggravating,

6

making the petitioner more death-worthy.

7

factor didn't require the jury to find that she was more

8

vulnerable and therefore that he was more culpable.
QUESTION:

9

As written, the

Would it have been all right, in your

10

opinion, then if it added the words Tracie McBride's young

11

age, slight stature, her background, and her unfamiliarity

12

with San Angelo, Texas made her more vulnerable and

13

therefore?

14

it would have been okay?

15

Or it therefore made her more vulnerable, then

MR. CROOKS:

That might indeed pass muster, Your

16

Honor, and that shows the very probably with this non-

17

statutory aggravator, is the extent to which it has to be

18

written in order to create that sort of nexus between the

19

particular characteristic and the petitioner's culpability

20

and death-worthiness.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Crooks, can I ask just -- I'm

22

trying to clarify my -- about the facts here?

23

defendant in this case was an African American?

MR. CROOKS:

2

QUESTION:

Was white.
And did this aggravating circumstance

3

sort of highlight that relationship, that contrast, do you

4

think?
MR. CROOKS:

5

It certainly could have invited the

6

victim to think -- or invited the jury to think about the

7

respective races.
QUESTION:

8

9

The vulnerability point and the young

white girl who was killed by this black defendant.
MR. CROOKS:

10

And especially the words background

11

and personal characteristics are so open-ended, they

12

certainly could have invited consideration of things like

3

race or other --

4

QUESTION:

Well, correct me if -- if I'm wrong.

5

I thought the law specifically required the jury to say

6

that -- that the race of the victim or the perpetrator

7

were irrelevant to their considerations.

8

that?

20
21

MR. CROOKS:

No, Your Honor.

Am I wrong about

You're correct

about that, but -QUESTION:

And the redrafting that you said

22

could have -- could have made this okay, that -- would

23

that any less have pointed out the fact that this was a

white woman?

It would not, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

I mean, is this a new argument?

2

you saying that this is invalid because -- because it

3

invited the jury to consider race?

4

MR. CROOKS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. CROOKS:

Are

No, Your Honor.
Is that your argument here?
No, it's not, Your Honor.

We

7

contend that these non-statutory aggravating factors are

8

invalid because they were overbroad in the sense that, as

9

worded, the jury could not help but find them because

10

those factors are present in every homicide, and thereby

11

the Government stacked the deck because the Government had

12

two factors the jury could not help but find, and then the

13

jury was told you must treat these as aggravating and you

14

must find that the petitioner is more death-worthy as a

15

result of these non-statutory aggravating factors by

16

definition.

17

QUESTION:

Do we have to agree with you in order

18

to find for you on this point?

19

your arguments was that regardless of how ultimately you

20

should assess these particular factors, it was the failure

21

of the circuit, in effect, to -- to discuss the issue in a

22

-- in a comprehensive way to flesh out its analysis, which

23

-- which made its treatment as a matter of process

24

inadequate.

25

Because I thought one of

Is that also an argument of yours?

MR. CROOKS:

That is an argument, Your Honor,

1

and we do contend that the Fifth Circuit on this record

2

simply could not have found that the error in the

3

submission of these aggravators was harmless beyond a

4

reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

5

Well, those are really two different

6

points.

I think Justice Souter's question is asking you,

7

do you think the court of appeals should have had a longer

8

part of its opinion dealing with this part of its

9

analysis?

And you're saying that regardless of how long

10

an opinion it might have been, it could not have

11

rationally reached that conclusion.

12

Now, on -- on the process point, do you think

13

that the -- there's a certain minimum amount of space that

14

a court ought to devote to a harmless error analysis?

15

MR. CROOKS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. CROOKS:

Yes, Your Honor.
What would that minimum be?
At a minimum there should be, as

18

the Court pointed out in Clemons, a detailed explanation

19

based on the record, and as Justice O'Connor noted in her

20

concurrence in the Sochor case, there should be a

21

principled explanation of how the court reached the

22

conclusion of harmless error and that a bald assertion of

23

harmlessness cannot substitute for that sort of principled

24

explanation.

25

QUESTION:

Well, but supposing you go a little

further than that and agree that you can't simply say we

2

find the error is harmless.

3

of greater explanation beyond that that you think the law

4

requires?
MR. CROOKS:

5

But is there any fixed amount

Yes, Your Honor.

At a minimum, the

6

court should discuss the evidence underlying the

7

aggravating factors and particularly the mitigating

8

factors.

12

The court -QUESTION:

And you -- what opinion is it of --

of this Court that you say supports that?
MR. CROOKS:

Both Clemons and Parker v. Dugger

stress the importance of courts in conducting harmless

3

error analysis in discussing the mitigating evidence

4

particularly.

5

QUESTION:

What -- what does this -- I mean, is

6

this some special rule for -- for mitigating and

aggravating factors?

this argument and find it insubstantial.

constitutional requirement of individualized sentencing

2

which requires a new comparison of the aggravating and

QUESTION:

So, the court could say, we -- you

6

this opinion that the court considered -- aggravating and

determination the jury made was -- was okay.

to say anything more than that?

MR. CROOKS:

Why?

Where do you get that from, it

QUESTION:

What's the best Court opinion that

supports the statement you just made?
MR. CROOKS:

Clemons v. Mississippi in this

particular context is the best opinion, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Mr. Crooks, do I understand that your

24

principal argument, however, is that an aggravator of

personal characteristics, effect on family is too vague

and it fits every case, rather than this process argument

2

that you're now making?

3

words -- any number of words could satisfy your objection

4

that personal characteristics, effect on family wouldn't

5

-- wouldn't pass muster.
MR. CROOKS:

6

In other words, are any number of

That's correct, Your Honor.

And we

7

do argue not only that they were vague and overbroad, but

8

also that a court conducting harmless error analysis

9

simply could not have found on this record that the

10

particular error was harmless in this case.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Crooks, our own questions have

12

kept you on this point, but are you going to go to the

instructions?

MR. CROOKS:

Yes, Your Honor.
Let me, if I may.

I have a question

16

that I want to ask you and maybe that can get the ball

17

rolling.

On page 29 of the Government's brief, the

19

Government quotes section 3593(b)(2), and the portion that

20

the Government quotes is this.

21

the -- the court may impanel a second sentencing jury.

And the particular text that refers to the -- the further

23

25

hearing if the jury that determined the defendant's guilt

quote.

And that's the end of the

Do you take the position that the inability of

3
4

the jury to disagree -- to agree, rather, unanimously on a

5

penalty would be good cause for discharging that jury

6

after it had had an opportunity to consider sentence?

7

other words, can you have a hung -- is it proper for the

8

court, within the meaning of the statute, to discharge a

9

jury which hangs up on -- on sentence?
MR. CROOKS:

10

In

The jury would have to be

11

discharged, but there would not be a further sentencing

12

proceeding or a new sentencing proceeding following from

13

that.

14

QUESTION:

Well, why -- and I presume that's

15

because that reason does not amount to good cause within

16

the statute.

17
18
19

Is that your argument?

MR. CROOKS:

Our argument is that the statute

must be read as a whole, and looking at section 35 -QUESTION:

I -- I don't want to cut off that

20

argument, but I want to stick to my point for a minute.

21

Do you take the position that the inability of the trial

22

jury to agree.unanimously on a sentencing recommendation

23

is good cause or is not good cause within the meaning of

24

the statute for discharging it?

We take the position that that does

not fall within the discharge for good cause provision

2

Your Honor is discussing.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. CROOKS:

And why not?
Because the situation of a deadlock

5

on a penalty recommendation is covered more specifically

6

in section 3594 which provides that in the case of the

7

jury's failure to reach agreement on the penalty

8

recommendation, the court shall impose any lesser sentence

9

which is authorized by law.

10

QUESTION:

Well, but that can also be read, it

11

seems to me, consistently with the text of this provision

12

because this provision refers to the -- the court's

13

capacity to impanel a successive jury by -- by using the

14

-- the permissive term that he -- he may impanel one.

15

so, I suppose you could read the two statutes together by

16

--by saying that if the -- if the judge chooses to do so,

17

the judge may impanel a -- a further sentencing jury and

18

may submit the sentencing question to them.

19

does not choose to do so, then the judge is in a -- in a

20

position to make the determination by default.

21

you read the statutes together in that fashion?

22

MR. CROOKS:

And

If the judge

Why can't

The statutes cannot be read

23

together in that fashion because the plain meaning of the

24

term otherwise in section 3594 encompasses the possibility

of a jury that is deadlocked between particular sentencing

But I'm not sure that -- that the

3

otherwise has to be read in such a way as to exclude the

4

possibility of impaneling, let's say, at least one further

5

sentencing jury.

6

MR. CROOKS:

In that regard, it's important to

7

look at the background to the FDPA, which is that the

8

FDPA, in adopting this otherwise language, took it from a

9

previous Federal death penalty statute, the Anti-Drug

20

Abuse Act of

988, which contained an identical otherwise

21

sentence and a penalty provision like section 3594 which

22

the courts had universally interpreted to mean that if the

23

jury could not reach unanimity after one try, then there

24

would be a default court sentencing.

25

assumed that Congress, in adopting the identical sort of

otherwise language, intended to import that understanding

2

into the FDPA.

3

QUESTION:

Did the other statute have a

4

provision in it which on its face seems to permit the

5

impaneling of'a successive sentencing jury as this statute

6

does?

7

MR. CROOKS:

8

QUESTION:

I don't know that, Your Honor.
Can I ask you a question on -- on

9

this part of your argument?

0

and I think you may be right on -- on the interpretation

Imagine that you're right,

11

of the -- a statute, you know, that there isn't hung

12

juries, et cetera.

3

Imagine too that you can raise this

because of the fact that you submitted an instruction.

4

It's prejudicial in your case for the reasons

5

that you state, but would you state, but would you say

6

ordinarily, if we followed your rule, it would be harmful

7

to death penalty defendants for the reason that most

8

statutes will permit a judge to sentence to less than

9

life?

And indeed, to require the jury to know of that

20

fact is more likely to produce deadlocks and bargaining

2

that will end up with the imposition of the death penalty

22

rather than the jury doesn't know it and finally the jury

23

gives up and it goes to the judge.

24

mind of comparing your case, which I know you have to

what would probably happen is that the six who were voting

It seems to me it's more likely to go the other

Your argument is that this will induce the

First, Your Honor, as was pointed

out in the plurality opinion in Simmons, the fact is that

11

as the possibility of a less than life sentence also

13

But'even if it could go both ways, imagine, for

jurors are deadlocked, six for life, six for death, but no

MR. CROOKS:

11

If there are jurors who are

deadlocked between death and life but no one wants a

lesser sentence, their belief that they will produce a

14

lesser sentence if they don't agree is going to drive one

or the other over to the other side.

that randomness that is the error.

MR. DREEBEN:

1

That was the question that

petitioner presented in this case in attacking the ruling

of the court below that there were -- there was harmful

4

error resulting from the submission of these non-statutory-

5

factors.

7

We argued that certiorari was not warranted to

In briefing the issue on the merits in this

8

Court, as in briefing the issue on the merits in the court

9

of appeals, we developed a substantial amount of

10

argumentation to showing that these factors were not

11

invalid to begin with.
And I think that, although the Court has

12

13

discretion not to reach that question, it should reach

14

that question for two different reasons.

15

First, it should not review in the abstract a

16

holding that certain errors occurred and whether they are

17

harmful.

1

question is whether the court of appeals correctly held

2

that the submission of invalid, non-statutory aggravating

3

factors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

4

we would have focused our attention on the assumption that

5

they were invalid and did they perform the right harmless

6

error analysis.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

Certainly

Well, I think that that's a fair

8

reading of what we wrote at the brief in opposition stage.

9

The question now for the Court on the merits is how it

10

wants to resolve the harmless error holding that the court

11

of appeals made below.

12

intelligently consider whether the court of appeals got

13

that issue right or wrong unless you have an idea of what,

14

if anything, is wrong with these factors because these

15

factors address, as petitioner has conceded, legitimate

16

areas for a sentencing jury to consider.

17

QUESTION:

It's very difficult to

I guess if you take it on the

18

assumption that there were two invalids -- we don't deal

19

with it, we just assume it -- was their analysis adequate?

20

I mean, that's what basically the petitioner is arguing

21

based on Clemons, that it just wasn't a sufficient

22

analysis.

23

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice O'Connor, I'd like to

24

answer that question on two levels.

25

address what the court of appeals actually did, and then

First, I'd like to

27

SUITE 400

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

1

I'd like to address what we think would be the sounder

2

resolution of this particular issue.

3

The court of appeals gave an explanation of why

4

it believed that the submission of these two factors was

5

harmless error by adopting a methodology that says we're

6

going to redact the factors and consider whether, with the

7

valid remaining factors, this jury would have, beyond a

8

reasonable doubt, reached the same result.

9

court of appeals that is under a statutory obligation to

This is a

10

review the entire record in the case, and its opinion

11

makes clear that it did that because its statement of the

12

facts reviews in some detail the procedural history of the

3

case, the evidence surrounding the crime, the mitigating

4

factors that the jury actually found, and the application

5

that the jury reached based on those factors.

6

After the court of appeals declared, wrongly in

7

our view, that two of the non-statutory factors were

8

invalid, it went on to examine then whether that was

9

harmless.

It recalled in its opinion that there were

20

mitigating factors, and it said it was considering those

21

mitigating factors.

22

placed primary stress on the statutory aggravating factors

23

that the jury found and that the court of appeals did not

24

invalidate, and it said that, reviewing that material, its

25

conclusion was that the error in this case was harmless.

It noted that the Government had

SUITE 400
WASHINGTON, D.C. 20005

(800) FOR DEPO

1

Now, this Court has reversed several State court

2

determinations of harmless error upon consideration of the

3

invalid aggravating factors when the court of appeals

4

either summarily announced with nothing more that it found

5

the error to be harmless or when the court of appeals --

6

the State court in those cases did not, indeed, make clear

7

that it either acknowledged that mitigating evidence

8

existed or that it was conducting harmless error analysis.

9

Those things are clearly inadequate.
What the court of appeals in this case did is

10

11

not in our view constitutionally inadequate under the

12

standards that this Court has announced in its review of

13

State court decisions.

14

Now, if one steps back from what the court of

15

appeals actually did and asks whether these factors were

16

invalid and if they were invalid what influence, if any,

17

did that have on the jury, I think it's vital to

18

understand that the two factors in question related to

19

evidence that.was properly before the jury.

20

to factors that the jury was entitled to consider as

21

petitioner concedes, and the error, if any, in them is in

22

loose drafting.

They related

24

age, slight stature, background, and unfamiliarity with

25

the area.

And these were things that the prosecution had

exacerbated the culpability of the crime.

4

which we have reproduced in appendix to our brief, surely

made that clear.

And if the

Now, the second factor that petitioner has

challenged adverts to the personal characteristics of the

victim and the effect of the crime on her family.

And

11

that is language which is virtually verbatim out of this

12

Court's decision in Payne v. Tennessee, which makes clear

that the specific harm that a crime causes is a cognizable

feature of the sentencing jury's consideration.

Now, there is an argument, which I don't agree
with, but there is an argument that there is some

duplication between the factor of personal characteristics

4

and background and the other things.

5

QUESTION:

Well, if you don't agree with it,

6

explain to me why young age, slight stature -- those are

not personal characteristics.

8
9

MR. DREEBEN:

They are personal characteristics,

Justice Ginsburg, but the argument made clear to the jury

20

that those were personal characteristics relevant to the

21

culpability of this defendant in this particular crime.

22

He was an Army Airborne Ranger with over 20 years of

23

experience, and he has in his power a very vulnerable

24

victim who was very inexperienced, very young, very small,

25

and it was that -- that vulnerability to the crime that

the prosecution argued exacerbated his culpability and

constituted an aggravating factor.
Now, in the area of personal characteristics and

effect of the offense on the family, the evidence was

brief, but it made clear that Trade Joy McBride was the

And

that this crime is particularly exacerbated because of the

13

exceptional harm that it inflicted in taking this victim's

14

life and causing these effects on her family.

As it is, it presents to the jury the

16

opportunity of taking the evidence, which it heard and

which petitioner concedes that it legitimately heard, and

order to phrase a proper aggravating factor, the factor

has got to be phrased in a way not merely that it says,

11

says, look to what is unusually vulnerable about this

factors didn't do it.

5

And if that is correct, then -- then these

MR. DREEBEN:

I think the factors would be

6

better phrased, Justice Souter, if they were phrased as

7

you described, but I think that one significant point on

8

which I would disagree with your formulation is that the

9

fact that every crime, every murder has a victim, and

20

every family of a murder victim suffers harm has to be

21

unique or exaggerated in some way beyond the norm in order

2

MR. DREEBEN:

3

QUESTION:

Yes,

it is.

But once there's death eligibility,

4

in -- in weighing the factors, you can take into account

5

routine factors, as well as extraordinary ones,
MR. DREEBEN:

6

I assume.

I think that that's absolutely

7

correct.

The narrowing that this Court has required to

8

occur before a defendant may be eligible for a death

9

sentence occurs in the Federal system when the jury

10

considers the statutory aggravating factor.

If no

11

statutory aggravating factor is found, that defendant is

12

not eligible for a death sentence.
Once a statutory aggravating factor is found,

13
14

the jury considers all of the mitigating evidence and all

15

of the mitigating factors that the defendant submits, and

16

it can consider all of the circumstances of the crime

17

formulated as aggravating factors by the prosecution in a

18

non-statutory setting.

19

And although this Court has made clear that even

20

at the selection stage, these factors have to be specific

21

enough so that they are not basically masks for the

22

consideration of arbitrary or invidious or capricious

23

things,

24

formulation, relate to legitimate characteristics that the

25

sentencing jury may consider and, taken in context with

these factors, even if they are imperfect in their

QUESTION:

But there's this kind of a converse

22

problem, if you analyze it that way, and I -- I see the

sense of -- of what you're saying.

24

problem is that when, as Justice Scalia pointed out, these

in the sense of the statutory ones that go to eligibility.

2

If you continue to call them aggravating factors, you are

3

really putting a thumb on the scale because aggravating

eligibility is a factor which really does differentiate

this defendant from other defendants, says this is worse

MR. DREEBEN:

11

In a weighing State, the jury's

12

deliberations are more channeled and focused by the

13

necessity for finding that there is an aggravating factor

14

before it may consider it.

15

seem to provide more protection for the defendant because

16

it focuses the jury's deliberations on what the

17

prosecution alleges is aggravating.

18

from the fact that the jury must find that and determine,

19

as the judge instructed, that an aggravating factor is a

20

specified fact or circumstances which might indicate or

21

tend or indicate that the defendant should be sentenced to

22

death.

23

QUESTION:

The Court has made clear that once

stage, the decision maker can be given as much information

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, one part of your earlier

argument that went by quickly was we know that the jury

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Ginsburg, this Court has

12

made clear that a reviewing Court may conduct harmless

13

error review if a non-statutory -- if an aggravating

14

factor that is improperly defined goes to the jury.

15

has not elaborated precisely how a reviewing court goes

16

about that exercise.

QUESTION:

But if it's harmless beyond a

1

out the same way.
MR. DREEBEN:

2

The court of appeals in this case

3

chose what I think is the hardest method of harmless error

4

analysis.

5

to determine whether the result would have been the same

6

if the non-statutory factors had never been submitted.

7

It chose to redact the factors altogether and

This Court has made clear in Clemons v.

8

Mississippi that there is an alternative method of

9

harmless error analysis which asks whether it would have

10

made a difference if the factors had been constitutionally

11

defined in an adequate manner.

12

Here the distance, if any, between a

13

constitutionally adequate aggravating factor and the

14

imprecisely formulated aggravating factor that was

15

submitted is not great, and whatever distance there is was

16

crossed by the argumentation of the prosecution explaining

17

exactly what was meant by those factors.

18

The jury furthermore certified -- and this is in

19

response to a question Justice Stevens asked earlier --

20

that it did not take into account the race or gender of

21

the victim or of the defendant in formulating its verdict.

22

And it was instructed by the judge that it may not take

23

those things into account.

24

no evidence in this case reached the jury that the jury

25

would not have heard absent these factors.

And petitioner concedes that

1

Under that form of analysis, I think the Court

2

can be confident that this jury verdict would not have

3

been different if the factors had been formulated in the

4

specific manner that petitioner now appears to concede

5

would have been appropriate.

There is dictum in

The significant difference between the drug

kingpin statute and the Federal Death Penalty Act is that

7

the drug kingpin statute required unanimity for a death

sentence, and that was the only sentencing recommendation

9

that the jury was given to make.

10
11

It had no sentencing

authority in any other respect.
Under the Federal Death Penalty Act, the

12

sentencing jury should be told, when these options are

13

available under substantive law, that it can unanimously

14

recommend a capital sentence, it can unanimously recommend

15

life without the possibility of release, or it can

unanimously recommend a lesser sentence.

recommendations by so emphasizing that the role of the

sentence, but to reach a unanimous verdict as to what

22

sentence he should get.

that that's enough to overcome these other four things,

MR. DREEBEN:

10

Well, that is true, but Congress

11

is quite clear when it requires jury instructions as to

12

particular matters to go to juries.

13

Congress instructed that the jury shall be told that it

14

may not take into account the race or the sex of the

15

victim.

16

jury shall be told about the effects of hung juries, which

17

is a topic that's not even addressed in the statute.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY CROOKS

20

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

21

MR. CROOKS:

First, I would like to return to

22

Justice Ginsburg's question about the question of

23

harmlessness in this particular case.

24

extremely close and difficult decision for this jury

25

because they took a day and a half to reach a penalty

This was an

1

decision.

2

And it's also significant to remember that if

3

even one juror had weighed the balance between aggravating

4

factors and mitigating factors differently, no death

5

sentence would have resulted.
And on this record particularly, it simply can't

6

7

be said beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was

8

harmless.

9

With respect to the validity of the aggravating

10

factors at issue, again we stress that we do not dispute

11

the admissibility of victim characteristic and survivor

12

impact evidence in capital sentencing hearings.

13

problem here is the use in this weighing jurisdiction of

14

vague and overbroad aggravating factors.

15

factors were drafted and submitted to the jury,

16

allowed the jury to consider not only the things which the

17

Government highlighted in its argument, but many other

18

impermissible considerations that were very vaguely and

19

broadly worded.

jurisdiction, once having found them, was required to

21

weigh them on death's side of the scale.

MR. CROOKS:

If the jury were told that those

were the only two possible sentences, that might have
