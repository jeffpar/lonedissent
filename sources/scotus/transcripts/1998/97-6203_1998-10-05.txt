ORAL ARGUMENT OF QUIN DENVIR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. DENVIR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issues presented by Mr. Jones' case are,

11

first, whether in selecting certain factors to increase

12

the sentence from carjacking from 15 years maximum to 25

13

to life, Congress intended those factors be considered

14

only at the time of sentencing under a reduced standard of

15

proof, or did they -- Congress intend that they be

16

elements of an offense which would have to be pled and

17

proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.

18

We believe that the proper interpretation is

19

that these are offense elements.

20

decide otherwise, then the Court would have to face the

21

constitutionality of treating these types of factors only

22

as sentencing factors.

23

QUESTION:

If the Court should

Has the term elements been used or

24

defined by this Court in a decision, or a series of

25

decisions, or is it -- is the term we get from the common

law which is a summary of what the actus reis is?
MR. DENVIR:

2

I don't think it is -- has been

3

defined.

It may have been defined in Winship, when the

4

Court held that the prosecution had to prove beyond a

5

reasonable doubt all the facts that constituted the

6

offense with which -- of which the defendant is charged.

7

That may have been the closest to a definition, but I

8

don't think there's any definitive definition, at least

9

that I'm aware of.
QUESTION:

10

And I don't recall that that used the

11

term elements, although it might have.

12

been around since the ancient common law, I suppose.

13

just not sure that we have ever used it as the pivotal

14

point for decisions or for formulating rules.

15

MR. DENVIR:

It's a term that's
I'm

That may be correct, Your Honor.

16

think what -- as I say, the Court talked about facts

17

necessary to constitute the offense with which someone is

18

charged.

19

On the other hand, in McMillan for the first

20

time the Court did use the term sentencing factors, and

21

that appears to be a term that the Court has said can be

22

proved at -- to the judge only under reduced standard of

23

proof and perhaps by a lesser form of evidence that --

conclusory.

MR. DENVIR:

1

It's almost

I think it's the

2

reverse of the sentencing factor.

3

either an element of the offense, an element of an

4

aggravated offense, should be deemed an element of the

5

offense, but I think the major point we believe is that it

6

has to be alleged in the indictment and it has to be

7

proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

8

9

We've argued it's

Well, the Federal sentencing scheme

has a whole array of factors that the sentencer takes into

10

consideration after the conviction for the crime, doesn't

11

it?
MR. DENVIR:

QUESTION:

It does, Your Honor, and -And quantity of drugs being one of

4

them, and I guess if we were to adopt your position that

5

would be unconstitutional.

6

MR. DENVIR:

Well, Your Honor, I think our

7

position is that you have to look to the statute and see

8

whether Congress has identified a particular factor of any

9

kind, and has used that or made that the basis for an

20

increased sentencing range.

21

I think a separate question which we don't --

22

QUESTION:

So if Congress has spoken to the

23

issue, then we have to treat it as an element of the

24

crime?

question that the Court posed in Almendarez-Torres was,

2

what was Congress' intent?

sentencing factor or not?
QUESTION:

4

Was it intended to be merely a

I'm glad you brought up the case,

5

because I would have thought that might govern the

6

resolution of this case.
MR. DENVIR:

7

On the statutory question, Your

8

Honor, I think we have a much different statute and we

9

have a much stronger argument that these were not meant to

10

be sentencing factors.
On the constitutional question, we don't believe

11
12

that Almendarez-Torres resolves that, because we believe

13

that the Court stressed so strongly in Almendarez-Torres

14

the fact that what Congress had selected to trigger the

15

increase in sentence was recidivism, and the Court said in

16

both the constitutional and statutory parts of it that

17

recidivism has been as traditional a sentencing factor as

18

ever, and has been -QUESTION:

19

Well, so has injury to a victim.

MR. DENVIR:

It has been that, but it has not

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. DENVIR:

death would be relevant.
I don't believe that the Gov -- I

3

think the Government and we agree that there's no

4

distinction between serious bodily injury resulting, and

5

death resulting, at least in terms of interpreting the

6

statute, that they're either both elements of the offense

7

or something of that nature, the opposite of a sentencing

8

factor, or they are sentencing factors.

9

But I think that the key point in Almendarez-

10

Torres, at least it appeared from what the Court wrote,

11

was that the recidivism factor of prior convictions had

12

always been limited to sentencing.

3

as an element of the offense.

4

QUESTION:

It has.

It had never been used

It's been -- it was an

8

9

In Federal statutes?

That Congress hadn't done it?
Congress had not made recidivism

a -- that was the point the majority made twice, so we

3

think that that's quite different here, because what you

4

find is that Congress clearly has made serious bodily

5

injury an element of several offenses which we have cited,

6

and in fact that the States, who have traditionally dealt

7

with robbery, have almost invariably treated serious

8

bodily injury as an element of the offense, or at least

9

something that must be pled and proved to the jury beyond

20

a reasonable doubt.

21

QUESTION:

I mean, I think you're absolutely

22

right.

I think that the recidivism is, if you like, the

23

extreme.

24

all right, do you have a rule that just governs the

25

extreme, or is it a rule that governs -- maybe in the

1

statutory interpretation this is a fortiori against you

2

from Almendarez-Torres, that if you reach the

3

constitutional question, then I guess you have to say,

4

well, is it an extreme that only recidivism or is it

5

somewhat less?

6

MR. DENVIR:

QUESTION:

8

9

I think -Which is asking us to narrow

Almendarez-Torres away and make it disappear.
MR. DENVIR:

No, Your Honor.

I think if you

10

look at In re Winship and you look at Mullaney v. Wilbur

11

you have the basic idea that a fact which is an element of

12

the crime, which is necessary to constitute the crime,

13

must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

14

QUESTION:

15

Mullaney v. Wilbur.

MR. DENVIR:

QUESTION:

MR. DENVIR:

Well, we've come a long way from

I think that's -Patterson -- yes.
I think it has, Your Honor, and as

19

I understand it the Court in McMillan has said if it is

20

merely a fact which restrains the sentencer's discretion

21

within the statutory range, that it need not go to a jury,

22

and then in Almendarez-Torres the Court said, if it is a

23

recidivist factor which increases the statutory range, it

24

need not go to the jury.

QUESTION:

But --

Let me ask you the question, I think

1

in my own mind only -- I'm only speaking for myself, but I

2

would say that at the heart of this was --at least the

3

thought in my own mind that since, let's say 1,000

4

years -- that's an exaggeration -- a couple of hundred

5

years, we have statutes that define crimes, and we have

6

judges that assert punishment under the statute.
And when they assert punishment, sometimes it's

7
8

a little punishment and sometimes a bigger punishment, and

9

you can look into it scientifically with the aid of search

10

and find out what in general bigger or littler turns on,

11

and when we find that out we find certain factors, like

12

how much drug there was, like whether a person was hurt,

13

like whether there was a recidivist, and that turns out to

14

be true regardless of what the judge says.
Now, suddenly, if you decide to write some of

15
16

that into law, either in the form of statutory -- of

17

guidelines or statutes, does that suddenly become

18

unconstitutional, the effort to regularize what happened

19

in the past by saying explicitly that those factors that

20

did, in fact, govern punishment in the past now will be

21

presumptively, or sometimes in statutes more than

22

presumptively, grounds for increasing or diminishing a

23

sentence?

24

What is it about that effort to regularize that

25

should suddenly constitutionalize procedural requirements

that were not there when this very same thing went on

2

under the cloak of darkness because the judge didn't say

3

what was going on?

4

MR. DENVIR:

5

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor -That's what in my mind is lying at

6

the heart of this and, of course, my answer in Almendarez-

7

Torres is, except in extreme cases the Constitution does

8

permit Congress and the Commission to regularize what

9

previously happened silently, or without understanding,

10

or -- et cetera.

11

That, to be honest, was what my thought was.

12

MR. DENVIR:

I understand that, Your Honor, and

13

I think it partly goes to what is the definition of a

14

criminal offense and what conduct is ascribed to a

15

violation of that, and I'd like to give you a example of,

16

if what you say is correct, what could happen, and I

17

don't -- this was really -- was envisioned by the

18

dissenting justices in the Monge case.

19

But we have 18 U.S. Code section 247.

20

that someone who intentionally defaces real property, or

21

intentionally obstructs a person in the enjoyment of their

22

religious freedom, is -- shall be punished as in

23

subsection (d).

the acts include kidnapping or intent to kidnap, you can

receive life or death.

If bodily injury results, or --

2

and other things, it can be 40 years.

3

injury under other circumstances it can be 20 years, and

4

in any other case, it is 1 year or a fine.

If it's bodily

Now, the Solicitor General's position is, and I

5
6

think the position that would follow from what you've said

7

is that the jury would only determine whether there was

8

this intentional defacing real property, or interference

9

with religious rights, and then -- which would only

10

trigger a fine or a 1-year sentence, but the judge then

11

would make all of these critical findings which would

12

really determine this person's deprivation of liberty --

1

judge happened to get your case, and that's not the case

2

under these statutes, is it?

3

MR. DENVIR:

No, it isn't at all, and it raises

4

the possibility in this case, for instance, if Mr. Jones

5

had pled guilty to the carjacking as charged, and during

6

the time between his guilty plea and sentencing the person

7

had died, he would have just gone from 15 years to in this

8

case a potential sentence of life imprisonment.

9

But I think the other thing in response to

10

Justice Breyer's question is, I don't think you can -- you

11

can really quantify what judges have done in the past,

12

because judges sometimes don't express all that.

13

But I think the key point is, we've always

14

thought, at least In re Winship says that, that a jury is

15

the most reliable determiner of these basic facts as to

16

what a person did that was wrong, and what exactly will

17

trigger the potential deprivation of liberty that he or

18

she faces, and in this particular case, the serious bodily

19

injury resulting factor, a factor that only arose at the

20

time of sentencing, in effect increased the sentence that

21

Mr. Jones was facing by two-thirds.

22

QUESTION:

Well, would our system be any better

23

off if we went -- if we repealed the Sentencing Guidelines

24

and went back to the situation where the judges didn't say

25

what they were taking into consideration, but two people

would end up in Leavenworth convicted of the same crime,

2

one was committed for 2 years and the other was committed

3

for 20 years?
When Congress tried to regularize that, have

4
5

they made it subject to a lot of constitutional objections

6

that, as Justice Breyer says, the process wasn't subject

7

to before because no one explained their reasons?
MR. DENVIR:

8

9

Well, Your Honor, I think that once

again we are not challenging the fact that Congress can

10

pick out particular factors that will restrict the

11

sentencing authority's discretion within the statutory

12

range.

13

What we have here, and which we think is

14

critical, is, you have the definition of a criminal

15

offense and the attaching of potential penalties by

16

Congress, and we think at that point those facts that

17

trigger that increase, all the way up to death or life,

18

are facts that should be determined by a jury, because

19

that's the most reliable way it should be done.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DENVIR:

22

QUESTION:

But that was Almendarez-Torres.
Your Honor -I mean, those were facts that were

23

not proven in the crime-in-chief, and it increased the

potential maximum sentence.

I think what was pointed out in Almendarez-Torres is that

QUESTION:

11

MR. DENVIR:

Well -I mean, he did or he didn't.
Well, it may be as to whether that

12

death resulted from this crime, and certainly in a case

13

like we have here there is certainly a substantial

14

question as to whether this was serious bodily injury as

15

defined by the statute.

16

But these are traditional components of the

prohibited transaction that juries make factual findings

on under a higher standard because we want that

2

there was a very large quantity of drugs involved here.
MR. DENVIR:

That's correct, Your Honor, and the

3

only case that the Court has decided in that range is the

4

recidivism question, and the Court selected certain

5

factors about that that apparently were critical.

6

One was that traditionally recidivism prior

7

convictions had been limited to sentencing, had not been

8

used as elements.

9
10
11

12

The second was, they were very seldom disputed.
The third thing was that they were easily
verifiable.
The fourth thing was that the prior conviction

13

had been the subject of reliable fact-finding either by a

14

jury trial or an informed waiver of that trial, and all

15

those factors are really important.

16

The other thing that the Court cited was the

17

fact that the defendant could suffer from having that

18

prior conviction brought before the trier of fact jury,

19

and that -- as another reason.

20

None of those apply when you're talking about a

particular part of the criminal conduct that has been

singled out.

MR. DENVIR:

Your Honor, first of all, in the

2

carjacking statute it is likely that will come in anyway,

3

because the Government will try to use it to show that the

4

taking was by force or -- force and violence or by

5

intimidation, so it's already going to go before the jury.

6

If a particular defendant wants to keep that

7

out, he always has the opportunity to seek a bifurcation

8

on that issue, or to stipulate to the issue, but we think

9

the defendant should be able to make the choice as to

10

whether they will have the jury hear these and make a

11

reliable fact-finding --

12

13
14

QUESTION:

If that's true with respect to bodily

injury it's also true of a prior conviction.
MR. DENVIR:

It is, Your Honor, except for the

15

fact that that's seldom disputed, and generally it has

16

been found reliably in the past, where serious bodily

17

injury is a brand-new issue and should be found under this

18

higher standard by a more reliable fact-finder.

19

QUESTION:

But in the Old Chief case it was

20

disputed as just what should be the form of presenting the

21

prior conviction to the jury.

22

MR. DENVIR:

That's correct, and there would be

23

ways, perhaps under Old Chief or by seeking bifurcation,

24

that a defendant who did not want this information to go

So you use the term elements, which

is what your adversary uses, and it's just a question of

our parsing the meaning of the term, elements?

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think not, because what the

It was talking about a background where the

argument had been made much like the argument here, that

must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Court

says no, the State here has defined these to be the

has to be proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt,

MR. DuMONT:

Maybe it has, but --

Well, it is done against a long

practice, so I think what you

have in the elements of

have here. You have a

statute that says, whoever.

you a set of punishments.

robbery, the serious bodily injury would go to the jury,

and the other, it would go to the judge?

4

You say it's a matter of what Congress intended.

5

I read your brief and you say, well, the way the robbery

would go to the judge.

Is there any indication that Congress -- it

seems to me it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to

distinguish those two.

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think there has been

13

something of a paradigm shift over the last 40 years if

you want to look at the way statutes have developed, and I

1

The analysis was somewhat less clear, say, 40 or

2

50 years ago, and I think when you look at something like

3

the bank robbery statute, all of the cases under those

statutes have always proceeded on the assumption that the

question is, lesser included offense, greater offense,

6

separate offenses in the double jeopardy sense, or one

And the conclusion there has been that Congress,
when they set out three separately subdivided offenses,

each starting with the whoever language, each having

QUESTION:

Ve

Mr. DuMont, I assume if you have a --

5

you know, a crime that has a 10-year penalty, 10 years in

6

prison, now, that's serious enough that you need a jury

7

trial, I assume.

8

burglary, 10 years.

9

That's all it says, just, you know,

But if you define a crime as defacing a

10

religious building, or something like that, and provide 10

11

years for that, and then 20 years, another 10 years for

12

some other sentencing factor that's put into that, you

13

don't need a jury, and maybe even 20 years.

14

That's not disproportionate yet, is it?

I dor.'t

15

know at what point you say it becomes disproportionate.

Is increasing it from 10 to 20 disproportionate yet?

right to trial by jury, why would they think it

22

unimportant that in the one context you should have a jcry

23

determine that you deserve that 10 years, but so long as

about a jury?

I mean, I'm trying to come up with some

2

interpretation of the jury guarantee that makes sense, and

3

that doesn't make any sense to me.

4

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I can appreciate that effort,

5

but we would be trying to come up -- if we went the other

6

way, if we went back to a Mullaney system, then it seems

7

to me we would be trying to come up in a long series of

8

cases with some limits on this theory of, well then, what

9

is going to be an element?

10

11
12

What increases punishment

sufficiently so we're now going to call it an element?
Whereas, it is not only consonant with tradition
but much simpler and clearer to say, Congress defines the

3

elements of the offense, there are certain, perhaps a

4

number of checks on that, but if Congress has defined an

5

offense and then provided for a maximum sentence, as in

6

this case of life, there's nothing wrong with it then

7

saying, here are some intermediate stopping points as a

8

matter of sentencing, and we are directing sentencing

9

judges, in applying this statute, to stop at those points.

20

QUESTION:

Well, you have a constitutional right

21

to a jury trial to be -- where the jury, not the judge,

22

determines if a person is a bad man, but if the question

is whether he's a very bad man, that goes to the judge?

mean, is that where we are?

give notice of what they prohibit, or are invitations to

Justice Scalia's hypothetical in his dissent in Monge,

8

that we're talking about a -- it is unlawful to willfully

cause injury, knowingly cause injury to another, and

10

everything else is a sentencing factor, it seems to me

11

that would be quite vulnerable to challenge on vagueness

12

grounds.

13

It's not, it seems to me, very vulnerable to

challenge on the ground that the legislature doesn't have

the right to make knowingly causing injury to another a

square it with the results that we're asked to reach here.

MR. DuMONT:

Well, I think the jury trial

for that offense until a jury of your peers has found that

set a high maximum, which would have been perfectly

MR. DuMONT:

You don't have to give that notice.
No, nor do you have to give notice

of any other sentencing factor in any normal case.
I mean, if you have a kidnapping statute, and

the range on the statute is zero to life, the Government

11

is under no obligation to give notice about particular

things that might urge the judge at sentencing.

that you can invoke at the indictment stage, so I don't

has made certain sentencing factors more obvious on the

face of the statute.

It's

In fact, you've given more notice to the

sentencing in a way that he might not at the other -- in

the old type of hearing.
MR. DuMONT:

3

That's absolutely right, and there

4

was no question here of any lack of notice at any stage of

6

QUESTION:

How can you assume the defendant

7

always knows what the Government thinks happened?

8

it didn't happen the way the Government thought it did.

9

Maybe there wasn't in fact serious bodily injury, he was

10

11

Maybe

injured by somebody else.
I mean, the whole system is that you give the

12

defendant notice of what the charges are so he can decide

13

what to defend.

14
15

You're saying he committed the crime, therefore
he knows what the Government's going to charge.

16

MR. DuMONT:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. DuMONT:

Well, at sentencing -That's what you said.
At sentencing the whole principle

19

is that you know in advance if -- under the current system

20

you actually know in advance, much more than you

21

traditionally did, what the factors that are relevant are

22

going to be and, in this instance, a question of serious

23

bodily injury did arise between indictment and the

24

sentencing, and the defendant had notice of that at

25

sentencing, there was a sentencing proceeding in which the

defendant was free to contest that, and the judge made a

2

finding.

3
4
5

So in terms of whether there has been due
process here in any normal sense, I think there has been.
QUESTION:

In the facts of this very case, the

6

magistrate judge told him he was facing 15 years, and it

7

was a little confused because, do I understand correctly

8

he was not the one who actually administered the blow, it

9

was his codefendant?

10

MR. DuMONT:

11

QUESTION:

I believe that's correct.
So here was a magistrate judge who

12

didn't accurately notify the defendant of what he faced.

13

The magistrate judge says, it's 15 years.

14

MR. DuMONT:

That's true, and I misspoke.

There

15

was that notice issue.

16

issue that went out of the case at the time the defendant

17

decided to go to trial.

18

It seems to me that's a notice

If there had been a guilty plea, for instance,

19

based in important part on that misinformation, that would

20

have been a good ground, perhaps, for vacating the plea if

21

it later turned out to have been wrong, but I don't know

22

under what principle a defendant who was misinformed at

23

the arraignment but then had counsel and was presumably

24

aware of the contents of the statute, and went to trial

25

and got a jury trial on all the elements of the offense, I

1

don't -- I think that notice issue simply washes out of

2

the case.
QUESTION:

3

So ultimately there's no notice.

I

4

mean, notice isn't the problem.

5

notice either before the trial or before the sentencing.

6

MR. DuMONT:

7

QUESTION:

The defendant always gets

That's right.
All right.

That's right.

So if we call it a

8

sentencing factor, the defendant gains one thing and loses

9

two.

He gains the right not to have it proved in the

10

middle of his trial.

He loses the ability to have it --

11

the right to have it proved before a jury beyond a

12

reasonable doubt.
I think that's the practicalities of it, and if

13
14

that's so, the question becomes, does Congress have

15

authority to pick and choose which things it wants to make

16

elements, and which things it wants to make sentencing

17

factors.

18

MR. DuMONT:

19

QUESTION:

Correct.
And everybody seems to think there's

20

some limit on that, and I take it you don't have a clear

21

idea of how to phrase what that limit is.

22

that's what I'm driving towards.

23

MR. DuMONT:

If you did,

Well, the Court has given a variety

24

of clues along the way.

25

that a State or a legislature cannot define something as

It certainly has clearly stated

1

an element of the offense and then presume that it exists.

2

If you are going to define something as an element of the

3

offense, then you have to send it to the jury.

4

thing the Court has said.

5

That's one

There is a question of fundamental fairness.

6

There might be circumstances under which fundamental

7

fairness would require, says the Court, that something be

8

treated as an element.

9

and I cannot give you a good answer on how to give more

That is what the Court has said,

10

content to that, except that we will probably know that we

11

have a serious issue when one arises.

12

I don't think that any such issue arises under

13

this statute, because here we have a very serious, very

14

violent offense, defined in wholly conventional terms.

15

If you look at this, it is a robbery offense all

16

the way up until the word shall.

17

unconventional about that offense, except perhaps that

18

Congress added the element of possessing a firearm, which

19

is an additional protection, and what you have below the

20

shall are extremely conventional sentencing factors.

21

There is nothing

Here's a basic sentence we think is appropriate.

22

If, however, there's victim harm that rises to a serious

23

bodily injury, then it's more serious.

24

harm that goes to death, it's very serious.

25

If there's victim

There's nothing in that whole structure that we

think remotely challenges whatever constitutional limits

2

there may be on how Congress can define offenses, and

3

that's, I'm afraid, the best I can do for you.

MR. DuMONT:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF QUIN DENVIR
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. DENVIR:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I would

12

like to address quickly, if I could, the statutory

13

question, which we believe this statute should be

14

construed as not setting forth sentencing factors.

15

The Government's position is that, to identify

16

three offenses in the text of the section, the statute's

17

three penalty clauses would have to be read as alternative

18

completions for the offense definition begun in the

19

initial paragraph, and each completed alternative, taken

20

as a whole, would then be read to define a separate

21

criminal offense.

22

We believe that's exactly what happened there,

23

that if you take everything before the dash, you do not

24

have a criminal offense.

25

it does not say it is prohibited, it does not say it will

It does not say it's unlawful,

53

1

be punished in a certain way.
It is only when you go past the dash to 1, 2,

2

3

and 3 that you get alternative completions to that -- to

4

the introductory part, alternative offenses.

5

But if the Court should not rule in our favor on

6

the statutory construction question, on the constitutional

7

question, I'd like to make one more try, if I could, on

8

what I -- what we believe is required.

9

It appears that what the legislature does in

10

enacting a criminal offense is, it tells the citizenry

11

that if you engage in particular conduct, then you will be

12

sentenced -- you will potentially face a particular

13

sentence, a certain loss of liberty, and then we know that

14

behind that, behind the Constitution is the idea that

15

those facts, that to establish that conduct which leads to

16

that loss of liberty is something that goes to a jury and

17

is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.

18

We think that what the Court should hold is, if

19

there's any fact that the legislature singles out from a

20

transaction, from the citizen's conduct, whether it is an

21

action, whether it is a mental state, or whether it's a

22

result, that should be treated as an element of the

23

offense, and it ought to go to a jury.

24
25

A jury trial is not something that has to be
avoided.

A jury is -- under our jurisprudence is supposed

1

to be the most reliable determiner of that, and we would

2

have a higher -- this -- the whole idea is kind of, if we

3

can hide these as sentencing factors, we won't let a jury-

4

deal with them.

5

That seems to me contrary to our Constitution,

6

to the values that we have in proof beyond a reasonable

7

doubt and jury trials, and I think what I've suggested to

8

you would fit very easy.

9

be a different definition given to the jury and they would

All it means is that there would

10

play their traditional role of making factual findings

11

about the defendant that subjects that defendant to a

12

particular punishment.

13

I think that that is -- that seems to me that's

14

consonant with our Constitution and with those valued

15

principles, and this trying to somehow say we can treat it

16

differently, we can call it a sentencing factor, we can go

17

over the standard, we can get the jury out of it, just is

18

contrary to what we think criminal offenses are and what

19

they mean to our citizens.

20

They should know, if you do this, you will have

21

a right to have a jury determine it, and if you -- and if

22

they find that you've engaged in that conduct, then you

23

could be sentenced in this particular way.
