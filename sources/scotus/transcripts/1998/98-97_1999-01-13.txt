ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE GARELIS

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

15
16
17

MR. GARELIS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We are here today because California has been

18

stymied and hampered in its efforts to exercise

19

flexibility implementing a nationwide congressionally

20

authorized program of welfare reform.

21

California is merely asking that its statutes be

22

judged under the traditional, appropriate, rational basis

23

analysis standard and not under strict scrutiny which is

24

unduly restrictive.

25

appropriate only in an equal protection context --

Strict scrutiny, as we all know, is

1

Well, when -- when you -- when you

2

have a - - an alleged invasion of the right to travel,

3

right to move to another State freely and enjoy the

4

benefits there as a new resident, we have applied

5

something other than rational basis scrutiny to test that

6

invasion.

7

abandon that - -

And you're telling us that we -- we should

8

MR. GARELIS:

9

QUESTION:

I think what --

-- stricter test.

MR. GARELIS:

10

the

I am not asking you to abandon the

11

stricter test.

12

our statute does not either impact a fundamental right to

13

travel or suspect class or any other right.

14

is - -

15

What I'm asking you to recognize is that

QUESTION:

Our statute

Well, certainly we have some

16

authority from this Court that durational residence

17

requirements do affect the right to travel.

18

MR. GARELIS:

Except that our durational

19

residency requirement, because it affects only a benefit

20

level decision -- it does not affect eligibility -- is not

21

therefore a penalty.

22

context of this, where someone moving --

23

QUESTION:

A penalty would be something,

Well,

in the

I -- I think you'd be hard

24

pressed to tell a family that is forced to live on welfare

25

that instead of getting California's, let's say,

2

that's not a penalty.

3

consequences for that family.

4

I mean, this is -- this has grave

MR. GARELIS:

Because our statute is carefully

5

crafted to avoid the considerations that you're talking

6

about, Your Honor, our statute is carefully crafted to be

7

a temporary level, a temporary level of 1 year, and the

8

family is eligible for all of California's welfare

9

benefits.

10

The family is eligible for cash aid.

It's just

a benefit - setting adjustment for a period of 1 year.
QUESTION:

11

Well, just on that standard of -- of

12

review point, if we were to find -- and I know you -- you

13

disagree with this, but if we -- if we thought that the

14

right of travel were implicated here, were affected here,

15

would the standard then be strict scrutiny?

16

MR. GARELIS:

Yes, it would be if -- if the --

17

if our statute touched on the right to travel more than

18

just incidentally and remotely, and at best our statute

19

impacts upon that right remotely and incidentally.

20

change in benefits level or any change in life condition

21

22

to move.

23

upon a wide variety of reasons.

1

unless there's a reason to suspect that they're going to

2

take the benefit and run -- that the newcomer should be

3

treated like the long-term residents, that that is the

4

genius of the United States, that people can pick their

States and States can't pick their people.

MR. GARELIS:

California is not picking its

people, and people are fully able -QUESTION:

It's making a distinction between

longer-term residents and the person who is a newcomer.

10

And that runs through all of these cases, that you can't

11

-- well, perhaps you have some precedent in mind that's

12

not in the front of my head.

13

line of cases that distinguishes new residents from older

14

residents, that there has any -- been any one other than

15

the two where there's reason to suspect that the claim of

16

residence is not genuine.

17

MR. GARELIS:

But I don't know in that

Are there any such cases?

But the cases that discuss this do

18

it in terms of cases like Shapiro and Memorial Hospital

19

where there's an absolute denial of benefits, and we do

20

not have an absolute denial of benefits.

21

QUESTION:

Our newcomers --

Well, I suppose you could think of

22

the Maricopa County as not a denial of benefits because

23

they were given emergency care, so it wasn't they couldn't

24

get any benefits.

25

MR. GARELIS:

But there was a complete denial of

non-emergency care, and we don't have that in our case.

2

What we have is people are entitled to benefits.

3

are entitled to set benefits at the rate that they believe

4

is consistent with their budgetary constraints.

That's not the objective of the

What is it?
MR. GARELIS:

No.

The objective of the statute

is clear on the face of the statute:

money; number two, to help reform the welfare system by

16

removing a possible incentive to move to a higher benefit

MR. GARELIS:

2

QUESTION:

I'm sorry.

I don't understand.

Well, you said that there were two

3

objectives of the statute.

4

other was to deter migration.

5

that -- migration for purposes of higher welfare benefits

6

-- I said isn't that a -- a substantial impact.

7

at least one-half of the purposes that you've offered

8

affects travel.

MR. GARELIS:

One was to save money and the
And I said, well, isn't

It's --

No, it isn't because, as I stated,

10

we're making a very careful distinction here.

11

trying to deter travel in any way, shape, or form.

12

Because our statute is carefully crafted for a temporary

13

limit and people are given the rate that is the maximum

14

made payable in their prior State of residence and it's

15

only one part of our panoply of welfare benefits, it is

16

not a deterrent.

17

that somebody might care to consider when moving to

18

California.

20

We're not

We are merely neutralizing one factor

That is not --

QUESTION:

You're saying that the elimination of

an incentive is not necessarily a deterrent.

21

MR. GARELIS:

22

QUESTION:

That's correct.

I don't understand this.

I mean, if

23

I have -- Shapiro I guess -- Shapiro, for whatever theory

24

of it, I mean, it holds, doesn't it that a State cannot

25

say no welfare for a year, and the reason a State wanted

1

to do that is so people wouldn't come to get a higher

2

welfare benefit.

3

reduced welfare for a year, and the reason we're doing

4

that is so you don't move here to get a higher welfare

5

benefit.

Well, you say not no welfare, but

I mean, what's the difference?

6

The only

7

difference is you're more generous but not really that

8

much more.

9

difference in the -- in the -- in the theory of it?

I mean,

somewhat more generous.

MR. GARELIS:

10

What's the

Well, in - - under Shapiro, the

11

people affected by those statutes were not eligible for

12

benefits.

Here people are eligible for benefits.
QUESTION:

13

No,

I understand that.

You're -- but

14

-- but you're -- you're going to save money by the means

15

of not providing an incentive to move, say,

16

Mississippi to California.

17

save more money by not giving them anything so they

18

wouldn't move to California, it's clearly unconstitutional

19

under Shapiro.

20

you're trying to save a little less money?

Now, if you were trying to

So, why is it constitutional just because

MR. GARELIS:

from

It's constitutional because our

22

statute should be judged under the rational basis

standard.

MR. GARELIS:

And I believe this Court has

8

acknowledged that in the footnote in Shapiro which states

9

that not all waiting periods are penalties because our

11

They said that -- well, I mean, they

12

could have said that not all waiting periods are penalties

Isn't that the tenor of that

I don't -- I don't believe in - -

18

in terms of the footnote in Shapiro, that it makes that

qualification.

Sosna case and the cases on tuition, but we believe that

21

our case where people our -- are eligible for welfare

benefits, they -- they receive welfare benefits.

thing is that they're receiving them at a State mandated

rate.

6

there something special about welfare that distinguishes

7

it from other kinds of benefits?

8

MR. GARELIS:

9

Are you now saying, yes, you can

Is

There's something very different

and distinct about what California is doing because

10

California has carefully limited what it's doing to merely

11

the benefit level, and States have the prerogative and do

12

have different benefit levels --

13

QUESTION:

Well, I can understand that in terms

14

of, say, workers' compensation or unemployment

15

compensation.

16

we have higher benefits, but you're a newcomer, so you get

17

the lower benefits till you've been with us 12 months.

18

The same thing.

MR. GARELIS:

Suppose California said,

I think what you have to look at,

19

the analysis that would have to be done is you look and

20

see whether or not there has been a detriment to the

person who has moved.

that person was receiving in the prior State compared to

what they're receiving in California.

MR. GARELIS:

QUESTION:

Okay.

You get less -- you got less in your

Is the same principle applicable?

California is more generous.

Yes or no?

say my State of origin charges more annually -- less --

more annually -- right -- more annually to -- to register

13

14

said money is the driving force here, so we're going to

charge you the higher registration that you would have

paid in the State from whence you came?

MR. GARELIS:

I would tend to say that it would

Therefore, rational basis, not strict scrutiny applies.

But what could I cite for that then?

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think, Justice Souter, it's

important when one talks about the right to travel, which

is an enormously inarticulate phrasing of essentially an

interest that encompasses both a prohibition or a

MR. WAXMAN:

In our -How have they tailored it?
In our brief, Justice O'Connor, we

12

have suggested that it appears to us that California has

13

not, in fact, tailored it, and therefore the Court ought

14

to affirm the preliminary injunction.

15

If you look at what other States have done,

16

Illinois, for example, has one of these residency

17

requirements or two-tier systems, but it won't apply

18

unless the new resident was obtaining welfare benefits

19

from the prior State.

20

You could also tailor it by saying that it won't

21

apply to people who come to the State, as at least one of

22

these plaintiffs did, for a job and then lose it because

23

those kinds of people Congress wanted to -- it's clear

Congress wanted to encourage people to move in order to

obtain work.

The answer, Justice Scalia, was

jurisprudence that the right of free interstate migration

that rational basis is the test, but the -- the notion of

comparing citizens, Your Honor, is what emerges from the
