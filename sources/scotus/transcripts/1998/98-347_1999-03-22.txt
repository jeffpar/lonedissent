CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 98-347, William J. Clinton v. James Goldsmith.
Mr. Dreeben.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, in

11

this case, declared unconstitutional the President's power

12

to drop from the rolls of the military an officer who had

13

been convicted in a court-martial proceeding, sentenced to

14

more than 6 months of confinement, and who had served more

15

than 6 months of confinement.

16

Our submission is that this judgment should be

17

reversed for two reasons:

18

the Armed Forces lacked jurisdiction to use power under

19

the All Writs Act to reach the action to drop him, Major

20

Goldsmith, from the rolls and to declare the statute under

21

which he was dropped unconstitutional.

22

statutory power of the President to drop an officer from

23

the rolls is not a punitive criminal measure that

24

implicates the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause

25

or of the Ex Post Facto Clause.

First, the Court of Appeals for

And, second, the

1

Now, the jurisdictional question involves a

2

consideration of what powers Congress gave to the Court of

3

Appeals for the Armed Forces in reviewing court-martial

4

judgments which consist of findings and sentences.

5

Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is given a

6

specifically defined jurisdiction to review the results in

7

court-martial cases when particular sentences have been

8

entered and the judgment below has been reviewed by the

9

Court of Criminal Appeals for the relevant service.

10

The

The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces is not

11

given free-ranging jurisdiction over all matters that

12

might have something to do with military justice or that

13

might implicate matters affecting servicemembers who have

14

been sentenced under the Uniform Code for Military

15

Justice, the UCMJ.

16

allocated powers elsewhere within the military to consider

17

personnel actions that might be viewed as collateral

18

consequences --

19

Rather, Congress has specially

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, exactly how could the

20

Respondent have proceeded to raise his issue of double

21

jeopardy, and -- and before what agency or agencies?

22

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice O'Connor, Major Goldsmith

23

had three avenues essen -- essentially, in which he could

24

raise his claim.

25

would be to raise it before the military itself, the

The first, which he availed himself of,

Secretary of the Air Force, in response to the notice that

2

he received that action was being considered to drop him

3

from the rolls.

4

agency, which in this case he in fact did, along with a

5

myriad of other reasons, both equitable and statutory, why

6

he claimed he should not be dropped from the rolls.

7

So he could present that claim to the

If the Secretary of the Air Force does indeed

8

finalize an action to drop him from the rolls -- which has

9

not happened in this case -- he can present a claim to the

10

Board of Correction of Military Records, which is a

11

civilian body within the military service, and has the

12

power to correct military records or to relieve injustice.

13

And he can, before that body, make a claim that his

14

action -- to drop him from the rolls -- is

15

constitutionally barred or otherwise improper.

16

And most importantly here, he has recourse to

17

the Federal district courts to make a claim that the

18

action to drop him from the rolls would violate the

19

Constitution.

20

could avail himself of.

21

Administrative Procedure Act in a court that had proper

22

venue and jurisdiction to hear that claim, and he could

23

challenge the action -- dropping him from the rolls --

24

claiming that it violated his constitutional rights.

25

There are two different avenues that he
One would be an action under the

1

suffer some irreparable injury from the action, seek

2

injunctive relief that would bar the finalization of the

3

action, provided he could make the normal equitable

4

showings that go along with that.

5

QUESTION:

Well, what if, in the case of an

6

ordinary criminal conviction within the armed services

7

that's been upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Armed

8

Forces, does a defendant in a situation like that have

9

resort to Federal courts under habeas corpus or something

10
11

else, or not at all?
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Chief Justice Rehnquist.

12

After the conviction has been finally reviewed within the

13

military system, and the servicemember has exhausted other

14

avenues that are provided under the UCMJ to attempt to get

15

relief from the conviction, he can then bring a habeas

16

corpus action under the standard section governing habeas

17

corpus, Section 2241 of Title 28, and argue that his

18

conviction is affected by a fundamental defect that

19

requires that it be set aside.

20

In this case, of course, Major Goldsmith is not

21

challenging his underlying conviction.

He is raising a

22

claim that the action to drop him from the rolls is, in

23

effect, another criminal punishment, because it was

24

enacted after the time that he committed his offenses,

25

violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, and because it is being

1

imposed, or might be imposed, after his conviction has

2

become final, violates the Double Jeopardy Clause.
QUESTION:

3

Mr. Dreeben, what about the argument

4

that this relief was necessary to protect or effectuate

5

the result of the court-martial, which was specifically

6

that he not be dismissed from service?

7

that they had and that they didn't impose.

8

this a legitimate means of protecting the judgment that

9

there be no dismissal?

10

MR. DREEBEN:

That was an option
So, why isn't

Justice Ginsburg, we don't dispute

11

that the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has, in

12

appropriate circumstances, the power to rely on the All

13

Writs Act.

14

available to do service when there are other provided

15

statutory means of accomplishing the end in question.

16

Here, the standard, typical means of raising any kind of a

17

double jeopardy defense is to set up that defense as

18

against the action that is brought against you.

19

long as there are adequate means of raising that claim,

20

there can be no warrant for using the All Writs Act to

21

circumvent the specifically provided means that Congress

22

has allowed for the raising of this claim.

23

But the All Writs Act itself is not generally

And so

The All Writs Act is an equitable power.

If

24

there is an adequate remedy at law, there can be no resort

25

to equity.

QUESTION:

1

And you -- you say the remedy is ask

2

the Secretary, then ask the Board of Corrections of

3

Military Records, and -MR. DREEBEN:

4

The BCMR, the Board of Correction

5

for Military Records, is an optional administrative

6

procedure.

7

that that is where Congress intended that servicemembers

8

go, within the military, to obtain relief from adverse

9

personnel actions.

It's significant here because it signifies

QUESTION:

10

Is that the one that's been spending

11

its time deciding whether Samuel Mudd was properly

12

convicted?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

I'm not entirely sure, Chief

14

Justice Rehnquist.

15

to consider claims that servicemembers might make, arising

16

from any aspect of their military record.

17

QUESTION:

It does have broad-ranging authority

In this case, but -- but not the

18

Samuel Mudd case -- in this case, does the APA review come

19

from the Board of Corrections?

20

MR. DREEBEN:

21

QUESTION:

22

You indicated in your answer to

Justice O'Connor there is APA review.

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

APA --

That's right.

Do you exhaust your remedies before

You can go to court under the APA and challenge

You can also go to the Board of

QUESTION:

My question is,

if you did that with

10

the Board, do you then have any judicial review of what

11

the Board did?

12

MR. DREEBEN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. DREEBEN:

15

Yes.

Yes, you do.

Under the APA?
Yes.

The Board's action itself is

a reviewable agency action.

16

There's another avenue of relief here --

17

QUESTION:

18
19

And -- and are these rev -- are --

are its actions often reviewed in the courts?
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

BCMR actions are often

20

reviewed in the courts.

They're most typically reviewed

21

under the guise of Tucker Act proceedings, because the

22

ultimate challenge here is that the servicemember should

23

not have been terminated from the military, which causes

24

him to lose military pay and other benefits.

25

claims can be framed, and typically are framed, as claims

And those

for monetary relief.

They're brought before the Court of

Federal Claims.

3

and thereby judicial review is obtained of any of the

4

statutory, regulatory, or constitutional objections that

5

the servicemember has.

They're appealed to the Federal circuit,

Now, in this --

I'm surprised to hear you say that --

that in order to pursue these judicial remedies, you don't

have to go before the Board of Corrections.

that well-established?

11

an exhaustion requirement.

12

MR. DREEBEN:

Is that -- is

I would have thought that there's

It is fairly well-established,

under the Tucker Act, the action that the individual is

challenging is being fired.

final action.

to the Board of Corrections of Military Records.

Frequently, service --

It is not

But that -- but that's not an APA

action; that's a Tucker Act action.

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

25

And if he is dropped from the

It's going to be implemented.

QUESTION:

One is that,

That's correct.

You -- you said that there was an --

an action under the Administrative Procedure Act.

MR. DREEBEN:

1

That's correct.

And I think that

2

under this Court's decision in Darby v. Cisneros, unless

3

there is a specific statutory or regulatory requirement of

4

exhaustion, the servicemember need not, before bringing an

5

APA action, exhaust a -- the provided administrative

6

remedy, such as the BCMR.

7

make a challenge to the actual decision to drop him from

8

the rolls.

9

He can do it, but he can also

If he is going to sustain such an action under

10

the APA, he has to be able to show that something more is

11

at stake than simply the money that he would have been

12

received if he had not been dropped from the rolls.

13

the courts have generally recognized that, through one

14

avenue or another, the Federal courts are going to be able

15

to hear and adjudicate the very constitutional claim that

16

Major Goldsmith presented to the CAAF.

17

QUESTION:

But

Is -- is it the case that the merits

18

in the jurisdictional question are tied together?

19

is, if you see this action as a punishment, it would make

20

sense to say that the -- the criminal court has

21

jurisdiction, through the All Writs Act, to stop some

22

other part of the Army from -- let's say they explicitly

23

said, And we're going to punish you some more by making

24

you do extra duty, making you do this, making you do that,

25

dropping you from the rolls -- I guess they might have

That

1

jurisdiction there.
But if you don't see it as a punishment, you

2

3

rather see it is as a consequence or some kind of other

4

general action, then, of course, they wouldn't have

5

jurisdiction.

6

to decide the merits in order to decide if they have the

7

jurisdiction.
MR. DREEBEN:

8

9

But, I mean, looked at that way, you have

Breyer.

I don't think you do, Justice

Because I think that the jurisdictional question

10

is fundamentally an allocation of power within the

11

military.

12

jurisdiction to review court-martial findings and

13

sentences.

14

here -- dropping from the rolls -- is not a findings or

15

sentence that can be imposed in a court-martial

16

proceeding.

17

barred from dismissing or discharging an officer except as

18

in accordance with the UCMJ.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. DREEBEN:

21

22

The CAAF is given specific designated

The particular challenged action at issue

The court-martial is in fact specifically

Well -It does not have power to consider

DFR, dropping from the rolls, actions.
QUESTION:

Well, even -- even if -- even if --

23

even if this were something other than you're saying it

24

is, certainly the way a double jeopardy is ordinarily

25

administered is not for the court where the first sentence

was imposed to start proceedings to enjoin another court.

2

You raise it in the second court, do you not?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

4

QUESTION:

That -- that's absolutely correct.

That's true.

That's -- that's

5

exactly the question I'm -- I'm -- I don't know the answer

6

to.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

8

QUESTION:

9

So --

So, imagine, though, that the --

the -- the different part of the Army had said this --

10

they -- they write out the following.

11

think that that court-martial board did enough by way of

12

punishment.

13

so, by way of punishment, what we shall do -- and we

14

promise it's punishment -- is we shall throw him out of

15

the Army in order to really punish him.

16

many of the words "punishment" 50 times.

We don't

We want to punish this person further.

And

And they write as

All right, now suppose all that had really

17
18

They say:

happened.

Then would this court have jurisdiction?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

Because?
Because this Court's jurisdiction

22

is defined to review certain kinds of actions that are

23

taken under the UCMJ by the court-martial proceedings

24

itself.

25

you've described has another method of recourse,

An officer who faces the kind of sanction that

1

specifically defined by statute.

2

can present his claim to the Secretary of the Air Force or

3

the relevant service Secretary.

4

And he can go to Federal district court.

5

Within the military, he

He can go to the BCMR.

And I think that it's important that in thinking

6

of the jurisdictional question that one keep in mind that

7

Congress set up the CAAF and the subordinate, intermediate

8

military tribunals for very important but specific and

9

limited purposes -- to review the court-martial sentences

10

that have been presented to them in accordance with the

11

jurisdictional statute.

12

given to these bodies to review, essentially, personnel

13

actions that may occur as a collateral consequence of the

14

conviction or other consequences that may occur of the

15

conviction.

16

There is no free-ranging power

And --

QUESTION:

Do you agree that the -- that the

17

jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces

18

is being impaired when additional punishment is added?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

No.

No more than the jurisdiction

20

of a criminal sentencing court is impaired if the

21

government initiates a second action that could be

22

described of -- as violative of double jeopardy.

23

original judgment stands.

24
25

QUESTION:

I see.

The

And, indeed, it still has -Right.

I assume if they

tried to impose the second punishment instead of the

1

first, and -- and undo the first, then -- then there would

2

be an impairment?

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

And there would be a -- a

4

separate question raised if what the military did was take

5

the actual court-martial findings and sentence and

6

specifically revise it, and increase the punishment,

7

contrary to the specific provisions of the UCMJ, and

8

contrary to the affirmed judgment of the appellate court.

9

A traditional use of the All Writs Act power would be to

10

compel that the judgment that has been affirmed and

11

adjudicated in a particular manner be adhered to.

12

But this action in this case reached beyond the

13

judgment and beyond the terms of the authorized sentence,

14

and enjoins other parties, who were not part of the

15

court-martial proceeding, per se, and who are not acting

16

under the UCMJ, and who are not acting in pursuance of the

17

judgment of conviction, but, rather, are exercising

18

separate authority altogether to take an officer who has

19

been convicted in a court-martial and get him out of the

20

Air Force as a result of that.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, is there any practical

22

difference in these three ways of removing an officer?

23

One is if the court-martial itself had imposed discharge.

24

One is an administrative separation.

25

what we're dealing with here; you refer to it by three

difference among the three?

They all get the person out, and that person

MR. DREEBEN:

Is there any practical

There -- there are a number of

5

legal and practical differences, Justice Ginsburg.

The

6

first and central one here is that the action of a

7

court-martial in dismissing an officer is considered to be

8

about the worst punishment that a court-martial can

9

impose, about the worst punishment that can be experienced

10

by an officer.

11

out of the military service as a punishment.

12

a punitive measure, and designed to be perceived as such.

13

It carries the stigma of having been taken
And so it is

The action of dropping from the rolls, in

14

contrast, grew up from the history of a law in the 18 --

15

enacted in 1870, that permitted the President to simply

16

recognize that if an officer were AWOL, absent without

17

leave, and not serving any services for the military, not

18

performing any work for the military, he could be simply

19

dropped from the rolls without characterization of how he

20

left the military.

21

A dismissal is roughly equivalent to a

22

dishonorable discharge.

23

a removal from the military without characterization of

24

the service experience at all.

25

Dropping from the rolls is simply

And you say that Congress set up this

MR. ECONOMIDY:

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
QUESTION:

9

Well, actually, I do.

I mean,

what -- what do you say to his point, that -- as I take

10

it, he says that the -- that the CAAF has very broad

11

jurisdiction, that -- that if a commander decides to put

12

somebody in prison for 3 extra months or extra duty or any

13

of these things intended as a punishment, yes, you can go

14

to the CAAF, because that's the most practical route, it's

15

somehow related to the basic sentence, and that's all you

16

need?

17

So -- so, if you were to say there's authority

18

here that says to the contrary -- and this is all military

19

law, I -- I don't know what the military -- we have an

20

expert military court saying he's right.

21

authority do you have to say he's not right?
MR. DREEBEN:

22

So -- so, what

of the meaning and interpretation of All Writs Act

law.

2

appellate court that might have, but did not, actually

3

review an underlying criminal judgment if somebody else

threatens actions that conceivably would implicate double

jeopardy rights.

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose he'd say that the --

in the military, perhaps though not in the civil system,

what -- there -- there is some kind of a remedy, where a

commander takes a person and subjects him to punishment

10

growing out of a conviction, and that conviction specified

11

you shouldn't have that punishment.

12

go back to the original court-martial and attack it first.

13

But if you do do that, there might be an appeal, so

14

they're preserving their appellate jurisdiction.

MR. DREEBEN:

And maybe you have to

on such and such a date.
MR. DREEBEN:

2

Well,

I -- I think I conceded

earlier that if there were a formal modification of the

actual judgment that had been before a reviewing court,

5

it to rectify the --

QUESTION:

What if it purported to be a

modification but there was no actual power to modify; the

to modify the earlier judgment, but they didn't?

Would they have jurisdiction to

19

MR. DREEBEN:

If I understand your hypothetical

20

correctly, they would have authority to say that you

21

cannot modify the judgment in the fashion that you thought

22

you had authority to do.

23

broadly on that, because there is actually authority of

24

the JAG to reduce a sentence even after it has been

25

affirmed.

And so, to a large extent, you really have to

2

understand that the CAAF's authority is limited to

3

ensuring fair rights under the UCMJ for the court-martial

4

sentences that are brought before it for review.

5

thereafter, other bodies in the military and other bodies

6

in the Federal court system have responsibility for

7

adjudicating the constitutional and statutory claims that

8

servicemembers might render.

9

And

And I don't think that that's terribly different

10

from the civilian courts, but it should be reinforced by

11

an additional principle here.

12

justice is to reinforce discipline and order within the

13

military system.

14

jurisdictional and statutory bases within the military for

15

maintaining discipline, of which the CAAF and the UCMJ are

just one.
