ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL S. REHUREK

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. REHUREK:

QUESTION:

14

Rehurek, Your Honor.

Rehurek.

Very well.

Would you

proceed?
MR. REHUREK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether

15

the scope of a search under the automobile exception

16

extends to the personal belongings of a passenger when

17

police have developed probable cause to search a private

18

vehicle generally, but have no probable cause specific to

19

the passenger or her belongings.

20

Under United States v. Ross, a search of an

21

automobile based on probable cause extends to every part

22

of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the

23

object of the search.

24
25

The officer here had probable cause to search
the entire vehicle and its contents because he had reason

to believe that the vehicle was transporting contraband

to

and that it could be concealed anywhere inside the

3

vehicle.

4

Once probabl'e cause is established to search the

5

entire vehicle, that probable cause extends to every

6

plausible repository of the object of the search.

7

QUESTION:

Am I right that in -- in Ross the

8

reason that -- the source, if you will, of the probable

9

cause was -- was information about -- I guess it was the

10

driver of the car, one person anyway?

11

MR. REHUREK:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

That's correct, Your Honor.

So, Ross did not have the issue in it

that we have here.
MR. REHUREK:

That's true, neither Ross nor

\jr

%

15

Carroll nor Acevedo nor other cases from this Court on the

16

automobile exception.

17

The precise question involved here, of course,

18

involves the passenger's personal belongings when there

19

isn't specific probable cause.

20

still controls the outcome of this case because the rule

21

announced in Ross covers this kind of situation and many,

22

many other kinds of situations.

23

QUESTION:

However, I feel that Ross

Well, Ross was an effort to get --

24

25

those cases that just parsed the thing down to a fare4

thee-well, wasn't it?
MR. REHUREK:

2

It absolutely was, Mr. Chief

3

Justice, and it was also a way to allow officers to know

4

what the extent of their legal authority was.

5

regard, it was also a way to let citizens know what the

6

extent of their rights were.

7

QUESTION:

And in that

If this passenger, when she was told

8

to exit the vehicle by the police, clutched her bag with

9

her, then is that the dividing line that -- could the

10

police, not having suspicion relating to her, but relating

11

to the driver who had the syringe in his pocket -- could

12

the police say that was in the vehicle, therefore I can

13

search it?

14

MR. REHUREK:

Justice Ginsburg, there's two

15

responses to that.

16

plausible repository of the contraband that was being

17

searched for here, and it was inside the place where the

18

probable cause attached.

19

even if the passenger had picked up her purse and taken it

20

outside with her, the officer would have been within his

21

authority to have her put it back in the car or,

22

alternatively, to tell her not to take -- pick it up and

23

take it out of the car --

24
25

QUESTION:

First, that item, the purse, is a

In view of that, I think yes,

search the person?

No, Your Honor.

DiRe teaches us

2

that a search of a person is going to require the

3

individualized probable cause that respondent wants to see

4

attached to the purse.

5

QUESTION:

If DiRe is a given, if it's the law

6

that you can't search the person, then why is that we can

search the purse?

MR. REHUREK:

MR. REHUREK:

Your Honor, I think there's a

dividing line here that -- that's probably based more on

10

actual practice and common sense than anything else.

11

I would argue that a line should be drawn at articles of

12

clothing that are actually being worn by the person

13

getting out of the car.

14

clothing, that amounts to a search of the person.

15

However, any other object that might be inside the car

16

when probable cause is established, picked up and taken

17

out of the car, even if it's an item of clothing, ought to

18

be subject to search by the officer because again it's at

19

the place when probable cause is established and it's a

20

plausible repository.

QUESTION:

But

If there's a search of an item of

Well, do you take the position that

probable cause extends to every container in the car?
MR. REHUREK:

Only, Justice O'Connor, with one

24

qualification, and that is that the container has to be

25

capable of holding the object of the search.

MR. REHUREK:

I think the

officer always had probable cause to search the entire car

in this particular situation.

Young, the driver, that furnished that probable cause.

It's just that it was Mr.

didn't -- the probable cause didn't exactly start there

of the car.

MR. REHUREK:

Well, that's a Rakas sort of

situation by and large, but if that passenger was not the

owner of that property --

5

QUESTION:

He's not.

6

MR. REHUREK:

Okay.

Rakas tells us that a

7

passenger who is not the owner of the car has no

8

legitimate expectation of privacy in places such as under

9

the seat or in the glove box or, for this example, on the

10

front seat either.

12

situation, I would say probably not, he wouldn't be able

13

to challenge that.

14

QUESTION:

So, without that legitimate

So the -- so the -- the passenger

15

would not have standing to challenge the search of the

entire car, but the right to search the entire car would

privacy interest in her own purse.

MR. REHUREK:

Well, I'm not trying to say that

3

the search of the person can occur without individualized

located in a place where there is generalized probable

cause to search, then that container is subject to search

MR. REHUREK:

I think the search of a purse

3

that's being held by somebody is not the equivalent of a

And again, of course, the officer -- officer

can't just approach and decide to search the purse because

12

it's not a search of the person and he can get away with

it.

He'll need probable cause for that too.

However, in my view it certainly would have been

covered by a warrant had a warrant issued, but not because

the officer had particularized probable cause to the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA A. McDOWELL

15

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

16

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

17
18
19

MS. McDOWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In United States v. Ross, the Court articulated

20

a clear, logical, and easily applied rule that probable

21

cause to search a car gives the police the authority to

22

search any container in the car that might contain the

23

object of the search.

24

from that rule simply because it's owned by a passenger

25

whom the police do not have probable cause to arrest.

The container should not be exempt

In many such cases, like this one, a police

1

2

officer still could reasonably conclude that the object of

3

the search may be found in the passenger's purse or other

4

container.

5

QUESTION:

We're probing why this rule doesn't

6

extend to the search of a passenger in the car.

It would

7

seem to me almost easier for the driver to say, here,

8

quick, take the drugs, to the passenger than to stop and

9

put it in the passenger's purse.

Why can't we search the

10

passenger too?

11

Certainly under your -- the logic of your position, it

12

would clearly extend to the passenger.

13

Let's say DiRe is not on the books.

MS. McDOWELL:

Certainly the logic of our

14

position would tend to extend to a search of the passenger

15

as well.

There might be --

We would conclude that the

20

rationale of DiRe may be incorrect to the extent that it

21

suggests that there's no probable cause to believe that

22

there's contraband on the passenger.

23

However, there would be another rationale to

24

preserve DiRe but to allow the search here, and that would

25

be to recognize that a search of the person is more

1

intrusive for Fourth Amendment purposes than a search

2

merely of someone's belongings.

3

QUESTION:

But the standard to justify that

4

search is the same whether we're talking about a search of

5

the person or -- or a search of a receptacle.

6

it's still the probable cause standard.

7

MS. McDOWELL:

I mean,

That's correct, but the Fourth

8

Amendment also incorporates the concept of what is a

9

reasonable search and one might be able to say that what's

10

reasonable in the context of property is not reasonable in

11

the context of a personal search.
QUESTION:

12

So, probable cause -- to search the

13

person, you're saying perhaps we would have to say there

14

would be probable -- required probable cause plus

15

something more.

16

MS. McDOWELL:

Perhaps one could say that there

17

needs to be somewhat more individualized suspicion

18

directed at the person in order to conduct a personal

19

search.

20

QUESTION:

I'm not sure why that is.

I'd much

21

prefer that a police officer search my pockets than my

22

briefcase.

Maybe that's just idiosyncratic with me, but

Also, we have raised the possibility that in

2

many circumstances, a driver of the car who is clearly

involved in illegal activity would have an opportunity to

11

The Fourth Amendment requires probable cause,

12

and in this case there was no probable cause to search the

passenger.

with this Court's holdings in Ross and Acevedo which

require probable cause before a container can be searched.

The State is asking this Court to carve out an

MS. DOMONKOS:

Without probable cause, this -- this search

That is correct.

6

10

alternative, if they have reason to believe that a
