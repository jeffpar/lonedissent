CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

3

We'll hear argument

4

now in two cases that have been consolidated for argument:

5

No. 97-1927, Rodney C. Hanlon, et al. v. Paul W. Berger;

6

and 98-83, Charles H. Wilson v. Harry Layne.

Mr. Cordray.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN NO. 97-1927
AND THE FEDERAL RESPONDENTS IN NO. 98-83

10

MR. CORDRAY:

11
12

please the Court:
I represent the Marshals Service officers in

13
14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Wilson and all the officials in Hanlon.

15

There are two issues in these cases:

the

16

constitutional issue itself and the further issue of

17

whether in any event these officers should be held

18

personally liable for money damages when, at the time they

19

acted, the law was not clearly established and it was not

20

apparent that their conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.
We submit that however the Court decides the

21
22

constitutional issue is a matter of first impression in

23

this case.

24

qualified immunity should be upheld for these officers

25

here.

Mitchell v. Forsyth compels the result that

Turning first to the constitutional issue, as

1

2

framed by the Court, the issue is whether law enforcement

3

officials violate the Fourth Amendment when they permit

4

members of the news media to accompany them in order to

5

observe and report on their execution of a warrant.
We submit that it would be wrong to erect a per

6

7

se rule that in all circumstances such conduct is

8

improper.

9

Hanlon case involved open fields or had the arrest of

Certainly to the extent that the search in the

10

Dominic Wilson occurred in a public place, it would be

11

unproblematic that the media accompanied the officers and

12

observed and reported on their execution of a warrant.

13

As a larger matter, moreover, there are many

14

instances throughout this country every day in which third

15

parties accompany officers as they execute warrants, and

16

this has been true since the inception of bench warrants.

17

There are many different circumstances.

18

to join in performing the search or the seizure in

19

assistance of the officers.

20

in other more tangential ways:

21

translating, identifying evidence.

22

facilitate the law enforcement objectives that are served

23

by procuring and implementing the warrant itself.

25

QUESTION:

They may be there

They may assist the officers

They may also help

Well, let's -- let's get to the help

that you claim was provided here.

What's your argument

here?
MR. CORDRAY:

2

Your Honor, as reflected in the

3

Justice Department policy in the U.S. Attorneys' Manual in

4

effect at the time of the Hanlon search and --

QUESTION:

Is that correct?

MR. CORDRAY:
correct.

9

Since been amended.

That's

Yes.
QUESTION:

Amended out of existence as I recall.

MR. CORDRAY:

10
11

It has since been -- that section has

No.

Modified.

Modified with

respect to the execution of a warrant.

12

QUESTION:

How does it read now?

13

MR. CORDRAY:

It -- it still is the case -- this

14

is set forth in the appendix to the blue brief in the --

15

in the Hanlon case -- that law enforcement officers may

16

assist the news media in reporting on and observing and

17

videotaping --

18

QUESTION:

Does it say that they may take

19

members of the media into people's houses, into private

20

places --

21

MR. CORDRAY:

It doesn't speak to that, but it

22

has now specified that they should not facilitate media

23

accompaniment in the execution of a warrant, Your Honor.

24

However, at the time the policy certainly countenanced

25

such conduct and, in fact, encouraged it.

1

However, the purposes served are the same ones

2

that were served as -- as stated in that policy, which are

3

to promote the aims of law enforcement by deterring

4

criminal conduct and by enhancing public confidence.

5

QUESTION:

Well, why do you have to take

6

photographers into someone's house to aid law enforcement

7

in that respect?

8

when it's over if you want to.

9

have to take people into private places.

10

I mean, you can have a news conference

MR. CORDRAY:

I don't see why you -- you

This Court has held that the

11

Fourth Amendment doesn't require a least intrusive means

12

test as long as the conduct is reasonable.

13

QUESTION:

No.

I just want to know whether

14

there's anything substantial to this or whether it's --

15

whether it's fluff.

16

It sounds like fluff.

MR. CORDRAY:

Well certainly, Your Honor, to the

17

extent that the media are permitted to give a firsthand

18

objective account of the actual events, that facilitates

19

accurate reporting on law enforcement functions, and it

20

may be quite helpful in preventing abuses in instances.

21

QUESTION:

But why just the media, Mr. Cordray?

22

Do -- do you know of any other area of law in which the -

23

- the media, quotes, have been given special

24

constitutional privileges that -- that John Q. Public

25

wouldn't have?

MR. CORDRAY:

1

No, Your Honor, and no one

2

contends that the media should have special privileges

3

here.
QUESTION:

4

So, they could have brought in maybe

5

their sister-in-law to -- to watch the thing too as well.

6

Is that -- is that it?

7

MR. CORDRAY:

Many law enforcement departments

8

around the country do have a public ride-along program

9

that will permit public to ride along with officers and

10

observe --

11

QUESTION:

Do they drive right into the house?

12

QUESTION:

Yes, right into the house or -- or

13

inside premises on a search warrant or -- or is the

14

program more one of letting them ride in squad cars and

15

see whatever occurs on the street?

16
17
18

MR. CORDRAY:

Well, there are a variety of such

programs, and I'm sure that in various circumstances -QUESTION:

Do you know of any that allow private

19

citizens to accompany officers inside dwellings to execute

20

a search warrant?

21

MR. CORDRAY:

Well, yes, Your Honor.

The

22

Marshals Service policy at issue in the Wilson case in

23

place at the time clearly countenanced -- page 7 of the

24

joint appendix --

No, but your argument was that there

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Do you have specific instances in

which this is going on?
MR. CORDRAY:

We have -- we have cited to the

Court the Fletcher case from the Florida Supreme Court

10

which recognized, as a matter of common usage and custom

11

at the common law as of 1972, that it was common practice

12

to allow media to accompany police --

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CORDRAY:

15
16

No.
-- even into private property or

residence -QUESTION:

I think the question -- excuse me.

17

think the question that we're -- we're pursuing is, are

18

individuals other than those in the media going into

19

people's houses for the execution of warrants in a

20

capacity simply as observers, not performing any law

21

enforcement function?

22

of us I guess got the suggestion from you that the answer

23

to that was yes, and we want to know whether that is

24

specifically correct.

members of the public, performing no law enforcement

2

function, into private places during the execution of a

3

warrant?

4

MR. CORDRAY:

That's where I beg to differ.

The

5

purpose of a public ride-along program, as with the media

6

ride-along program, is to serve law enforcement purposes.

7

That's the whole -- it's not merely for someone's

8

entertainment value or to satisfy someone's curiosity.

9

QUESTION:

that qualification.

going into people's houses during the execution of the

warrants?

All right.

MR. CORDRAY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. CORDRAY:

We'd just like to

I -- I can't speak to that one way

Do you have any instances?
I can speak to the fact that it

18

was recognized at the common law as of 25 years ago, that

19

it was common practice around the country for the media to

20

accompany --

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Cordray --

22

QUESTION:

For media to accompany, but not for

23

private individuals.

24

has never been common practice for police officers to

25

bring in non-media people to show that -- that everything

MR. CORDRAY:

QUESTION:

Can you answer my question?

as you know, there was no such practice.

MR. CORDRAY:

wouldn't want to concede that --

QUESTION:

I believe that's right, but I

Do you know -- do you know of any --

do you know of any such practice?
MR. CORDRAY:

I know that there are public ride-

11

along programs.

I'm sure they have different components.

12

I don't know for certain that they contemplate entry into

13

a home, but they do contemplate the public attending or

14

accompanying officers.

15

QUESTION:

16

about the law school program?

17

do have their students ride along.

18

have had professors who have written books about their

ride-along experiences.

20

of ride-along to avoid the unnecessary intrusion on

people's privacy?

MR. CORDRAY:

There are law schools that

Are there controls on that kind

I'm certain that they are, just as

a matter of common sense practice and to avoid potential

lawsuits and the like.

they are fairly common.
QUESTION:

In the -- in the Montana case, there

was no entry into the house by virtue of the warrant.

MR. CORDRAY:

That's correct.

misunderstanding.

12

13

QUESTION:

But there was an entry into sheds and

outbuildings, as I understand it.

14

MR. CORDRAY:

15

QUESTION:

Correct.

With regard to those, does the

16

evidence disclose whether those buildings had open doors

17

or anything like that or -- or what do we know about those

18

sheds and outbuildings?

19

MR. CORDRAY:

The search in the Hanlon case was

20

executed in two different places, in open areas on the

21

ranch, which I think fairly clearly would fall within the

22

open fields doctrine, although it is private property, and

23

at the same time in outbuildings.

25

way or the other whether they were within the curtilage or

not.

But they may well be.

constitutional argument that they are open fields -QUESTION:

3

I think there is a

And that issue wasn't resolved below

4

because it was a -- pretty much a per se rule applied, I

5

take it.
MR. CORDRAY:

6

I think that's right, both ways,

7

by the district court in our favor and by the court of

8

appeals --

9

QUESTION:

Well, do you understand the open --

10

QUESTION:

You don't really know whether open -

11

- whether sheds, closed sheds at least, that are outside

12

the curtilage come within the open fields doctrine.

13

haven't -- we haven't held one way or another on that

14

point, have we?

15
16
17

MR. CORDRAY:

We

I don't believe the Court has

specified all the details of that, no.
QUESTION:

But you don't understand the -- or

18

maybe you do -- the open fields doctrine to permit a

19

police officer to stay on an open field if the owner tells

20

him to leave, do you?

21

MR. CORDRAY:

As I understand the open fields

22

doctrine, it would because the Court has said that

23

searches of open fields, even though they may be private

24

property, do not implicate the Fourth Amendment.

25

therefore, I -- I think that that's correct, although

And,

1

again I don't believe the Court specifically addressed

2

that.

3

QUESTION:

But in the -- in the Oliver case, the

4

Court was referring to the fact that officers happened to

5

be in an open area and they were concerned with viewing

6

something in an open field from a highway.

7

-- in this case, the police and the accompanying news

8

people demanded, in effect, entrance and had the right to

9

enter under a warrant --

10

MR. CORDRAY:

11

QUESTION:

But in -- in

That's correct.

-- and -- and threatened the owner

12

with -- with imprisonment if -- if he obstructed their

13

search.

14
15
16

So, it seems to me that's quite different.

I --

I'm not sure the open fields doctrine would apply if you
told the police officer to leave.
MR. CORDRAY:

I think it's an open factual issue

17

in this case, and I think what's germane to the issue that

18

the Court has framed is that there was no execution of a

19

warrant in a home in that case.

20

particularly concerned with execution of a warrant in a

21

home, that would not be implicated on the facts of the

22

Hanlon case.

23

QUESTION:

And if this Court is

Well, supposing there's a policeman

that's standing out on your front lawn, and you tell him,

(Laughter.)

2

QUESTION:

3
4

I mean, is that a trespass violation

or a Fourth Amendment violation or what?
MR. CORDRAY:

As here, the police are operating

5

pursuant to a valid warrant, and it's been determined in

6

both cases that they were properly executing the warrant.

7

In a -- in a situation where the police are looking

8

through a window, they may or may not have right to be at

9

the vantage point they're at --

10
11
12

13
14
15
16

QUESTION:

I think that bears on the open --

open fields question.
MR. CORDRAY:

It may.

It may, and again I think

that's an open factual issue in this -QUESTION:

Why do you need a warrant under the

open fields doctrine?
MR. CORDRAY:

I think you would not need a

17

warrant, although perhaps in an abundance of caution to

18

avoid any problems that might arise in later litigation or

19

motion to suppress, certainly the better practice would be

20

for the police to obtain a warrant, as they did here.

21

But in any event, to return to the --

22

QUESTION:

Of course, just because the police

23

can -- can play around in open fields, it doesn't mean

24

that they can bring along anybody else they want to play

25

in the open fields.

1

MR. CORDRAY:

2

QUESTION:

No, but certainly --

So, I mean, even if you resolve the

3

open field question, there's still the further question of

4

whether whatever open fields immunity from the Fourth

5

Amendment the officers have extends to the -- the officers

6

bringing along somebody else as well I assume.

7

MR. CORDRAY:

I think that's correct, but that's

8

why I thought it was important to emphasize the Court

9

should not erect a per se rule against media accompaniment

10

in all circumstances where a warrant is involved.

11

instances, a warrant would be executed in such a way as to

12

not even implicate Fourth Amendment interests.

13

be executed in a public place.

14

area of open fields.

15

intrusion is much reduced in that setting, and -- and

16

across the board, across the spectrum of different

17

possible settings, each of them somewhat fact-specific,

18

each of them raising maybe a greater or lesser extent of

19

intrusion, those are factors that would be relevant in

20

trying to draw this balance.

21
22

QUESTION:

It might

It might be executed in an

Certainly the nature of the

But as you put it, we shouldn't adopt

a rule regarding media accompaniment.

QUESTION:

Correct.

So, it is -- it is part of your case

Perhaps.

The Court framed the

issue in terms of media, but in general the Court -- the

10

Court has -- has -- has never addressed the issue of any

11

third parties coming along.

12

We don't contend that the media have a special,

13

privileged constitutional right of access.

14

under this Court's case, but they as surrogate for the

But those are to aid in the specific

MR. CORDRAY:

7

In many cases, that's true, but

8

there are also a number of instances in which that really

can't be maintained.

For example, in the Hanlon case, the

assistant prosecutor, Kris McLean, accompanied the

the same objectives for which the officers had sought and

Well, let's -- let's assume for the

14

how do you weigh that balance if it -- if it involves

that?

16

Now,

Let's say a search of the home.
MR. CORDRAY:

I think that there the fact -- the

fact of entering a residence is a -- is obviously an

important consideration.

19

that raises the nature of the intrusion and magnifies it.

20

So, certainly that's a concern.

It is -- it is a consideration

On the other hand --

So, how -- how do we weigh the

That's correct.

So, how do we weigh that balance in

MR. CORDRAY:

6

In our view, we would suggest that

7

in any case where we're talking about execution of an

8

arrest warrant, not involving a search that's going to be

9

10

much adopt a general rule --

11

QUESTION:

But inside the home.

12

MR. CORDRAY:

That's right.

That execution of

an arrest warrant is going to be generally reasonable to

allow medic accompaniment because an arrest is a public

Well, but I -- I didn't pose arrest

I posed -- which is involved in the other case

-- a search warrant for items executed in the home or

MR. CORDRAY:

20

I think that it -- it's fairly

clear that as we proceed along a spectrum here, a search

that the photographers were brought along because there

We don't know that one way or

QUESTION:

Mr. Cordray, as I'm listening to your

10

argument and you keep saying no per se rules and it

11

depends on what the particular facts and circumstances

12

are, I have a certain deja vu feeling, and it relates to

13

the old days when this Court was trying to draw a luggage

line, telling the police they couldn't search the -- the

15

green suitcase but they could search the paper bag, and

16

then finally they decided in Ross, no.

know going in what they can do and what they can't do.

when, well, we'll decide after the fact and there will be

no rules going in.

Isn't there some real importance to being able

But to draw bright

Here I think there are certain bright lines that

could be drawn.

Yes, although we've -- we've

indicated that Semayne's Case is quite distinguishable in

our brief.

6

British case involving service of civil process in a home,

7

and the court itself distinguished between civil process

In Semayne's Case it was service.

That's the

Blackstone echoed that and that's

10

generally been this Court's approach, for example, and

Payton recognized that an arrest warrant permits an

intrusion into the home.

13

So, again, I think to extrapolate from older,

14

especially British cases and early cases general

15

principles to say that officers must have known how those

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE RESPONDENTS IN NO. 98-83

20

Very well, Mr. Cordray.

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

21

There are two fundamental facts that establish

22

the qualified immunity of the three deputy sheriffs I

23

represent.

24
25

The first of those is that the most able lawyer
researching this issue in 1992 would have found no cases

from any court condemning the mere presence of media when

2

a warrant is executed lawfully as a constitutional

3

violation.

4

held to the contrary, that media presence at most was a

5

tort under common law principles if -- if the media was

6

brought inside a home.

The only cases then in existence, in fact,

7

The second point is that --

8

QUESTION:

9

May I ask -- suppose it had been

clearly established that it was a common law tort to bring

10

the media into a home, but there had been no decision on

11

interpreting section 1983 or the Fourteenth Amendment.

12

Would you think under those -- under that assumption there

13

would be qualified immunity?

14

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

No, Your Honor.

I think it

15

would still be an open question whether -- whether this

16

Court would eventually incorporate those common law

17

principles into the Fourth Amendment.

18

QUESTION:

Well, assume that -- assume that we

19

on the first time we -- we decide yes, it's a clear

20

violation.

21

officers have been aware that they shouldn't go in if

22

their only restraint on going in was a well-established

23

common law rule -- a common law tort rule.

The only issue we have to face is, should the

No, because the -- the

doctrine of qualified immunity would operate only as to

the constitutional principles.

2

immunities for the officers concerning the common law, and

3

in fact, one -- one could find the situation where the

4

common law would -- would suggest to these officers that

5

they should not do this.

6

Amendment jurisprudence and the Bivens or 1983 action

7

against the officers, I think the law would still not be

8

clearly established as a matter of constitutional

9

principle.
QUESTION:

10

There may be other

But as a matter of Fourth

Don't you think it's a clearly

11

established constitutional principle that it is

12

unreasonable to commit a tort in -- in the course of the

13

search?

14

question of whether -- whether it was clear that this was

15

a tort, but if it was a tort, I think the game is up.

16

Surely you're not authorized to commit a tort in the

17

course of a search.

I mean, once you -- I mean, I think it's an open

18

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

19

QUESTION:

Wouldn't that make the search

20

automatically unreasonable?

21

that?

22

No, Your Honor.

Do you need a case that says

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

Let me give an -- an

23

illustration.

24

that in the absence of a warrant, something would clearly

25

be a trespass.

The technical issue of trespass may be such

1

under Fourth Amendment jurisprudence of having authority

2

to come into the house based on a warrant, then that

3

potential superior authority of the officer would overcome

4

the tort violation.

5

QUESTION:

Well, supposing you -- you have --

6

during a search or an arrest an officer commits what's

7

later decided to have been an assault and battery.

8

- you run up against the person in a way a court says

9

there wasn't -- that wouldn't make it invalid under the

10
11

You -

Fourth Amendment, would it?
MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

That's correct.

You -- you

12

would still have the issue under the Fourth Amendment, but

13

whether that use of force, which might admittedly be -- be

14

a battery at common law, is justified by the need to

15

control, under Michigan v. Summers, the people who are in

16

the -- the premises where the warrant is being executed.

17

QUESTION:

There occurs to me an even better

18

answer than that which is that the open fields doctrine

19

explicitly says that you can commit a tort and not violate

20

the Fourth Amendment.

21

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

Well, Your Honor, in many

22

cases the -- the tort issue and the constitutional issue

23

are going to overlap very closely.

24

case, the Wilson case, provides a good illustration of

25

where they don't overlap and where I think there's an

The common law has arisen in the

That's true.

protects the security of a person in his house against an

8

unreasonable search.

He knows that the Fourth Amendment

He knows that.

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

That's correct.

He knows a police officer normally

has to get a warrant -- normally -- before he can go into

12

that house in order to protect that privacy.

13

have a very good reason to intrude on that privacy.

14

He has to

Now, a person knowing that -- why wouldn't he

think, well, obviously you can't bring in a person who

16

isn't even mentioned in the warrant, which person is going

17

to broadcast personal things to 10 million people?

18

mean, if the lesser is forbidden, why isn't it obvious

19

that the greater is?

20

I

And so, what I -- what I want you to do is to

21

explain what's the thinking of a person who knows the

22

lesser is forbidden, but nonetheless he thinks it's

23

reasonable to do the greater.

it is a serious proposition to enter someone's house

2

without consent to make an arrest, but these officers had,

3

matching that issue, valid arrest warrants which they knew

gave them clear authority to enter the house.

that warrant he could take in other people regardless of

2

what the general law might be if the warrant were less

3

exact in specifying those to -- to whom it gave authority?

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

These officers could believe

5

that because at the time they operated, they were

6

operating under the direction of the Marshals Service.

7

The media presence was --

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, but there was a Federal statute

I believe in effect at the time.

It may still be in

10

effect as far as I know in 18 U.S. Code 3105, and it says,

11

a search warrant may in all cases be served by any of the

12

officers mentioned in its direction or by an officer

13

authorized by law to serve such warrant, but by no other

14

person, except in aid of the officer on his requiring it,

15

he being present and acting in its execution.

16

Now, how do you read that statute as allowing

17

private citizens or media ride-alongs?

18

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

If applicable at all, that

19

statute would be applicable only to the Hanlon case which

20

was a search warrant and not to the officers here who were

21

executing an arrest warrant.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose it isn't the fact

23

that the statute limits the number of people who can serve

24

the warrant, doesn't in so many words say that nobody else

25

can come along.

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

12

Well, Your Honor, I think a

MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

It would exclude on the

substantive violation, but I don't think it would exclude

still be the case that these officers armed with those

warrants would be operating under a Marshals Service

QUESTION:

Well, but in Wilson v. Layne, we know

what the Montgomery County Sheriff said, and he said it

5

wasn't the policy.
MR. FLETCHER-HILL:

6

That's true, and I think if

7

anything, those statements by Sheriff Right illustrate the

8

predicament of these officers because what Sheriff Right

9

also said was as to this operation, he understood his own

10

officers to be operating under Marshals Service guidelines

11

which did permit this activity, and he himself would not

12

condemn the conduct of his own officers at -- at this time

and not operating under his own office's policies.

The searches and seizures involved in the Berger

MR. ROSSBACHER:

Your Honor, there is a problem

normally would be allowed to go in, the theory that they

up, and that would relate to the purpose of actually

silence of the books speaks against the authority of the

legal authority to go in, not the burden on the homeowner

QUESTION:

Is the answer to this question no?

7

You have some cases that show that there are certain

people you could bring in, the translator, the property

you found anywhere about people you couldn't bring in aid,

you couldn't find any.

As a matter of fact we could.

found a number of cases, which we cited in our brief,

But we

that he can trespass in the open fields without violating

because the Fourth Amendment has been held by this Court

14

to protect houses and not open fields.

QUESTION:

indicates that when they're talking about serving a

MR. CORDRAY:

1

First, Your Honors, on the

qualified immunity issue, the fact that there's a regular

practice that's occurred frequently around the country,

the silence of the books there has to weigh in favor of

qualified immunity.

obeying instructions to allow the media to come along with

This practice has not been

It came down from headquarters.

How could it

How do we know that -- that not just

ride-alongs but entering with the execution of a warrant

16

17

for that?

MR. CORDRAY:

What -- what is your evidence

We speak to that.

It was taken

judicial notice upon much -- many submissions and much

22

Prahl case, the Wisconsin trial court found again that

23

this was common custom and usage around the country for

24

media to accompany police inside a residence when there

25

was an issue of crime or other matter of great public

in the Fletcher case where the Florida Supreme

QUESTION:

Was there

evidence to that effect in the case?
MR. CORDRAY:

4
5

What did they base it on?

There was.

There were voluminous

submissions and affidavits of this.
QUESTION:

6

But I'm not sure of the relevance of

7

that because there have been instances of police who have

8

been doing things that -- pursuant to clear policy where

9

the policy was clearly unconstitutional.

10

MR. CORDRAY:

11

QUESTION:

That's true.

So -- so, are we supposed to give any

12

weight to the fact that -- that there's some book in which

13

somebody has an interpretation --

14

MR. CORDRAY:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CORDRAY:

No, but when the --

--or even practice?
When the practice is fairly widely

17

engaged in, which is what was found in those cases, and it

18

has not been ruled unconstitutional, it's very difficult

19

to say officers should have known.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CORDRAY:

22

And --

Can we say --- the Moncrief case was a Fourth

Amendment case specifically.

23

QUESTION:

Can we say it is widely engaged in in

24

execution of warrants as distinct from visiting crime

25

scenes?

Because if there's a crime scene, robbery, body

Does the -- does the case evidence take us beyond crime

MR. CORDRAY:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

Do they go beyond crime scenes to

execution of warrants?

MR. CORDRAY:

They talk generally about a

variety of circumstances where there had been a crime
