ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. WALLACE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether the

13

standards of judicial review specified by the

14

Administrative Procedure Act apply to the Federal

15

Circuit's review of decisions of the Patent and Trademark

16

Office's Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences

17

rejecting claims of unsuccessful patent applicants.

18

The en banc court of appeals held that those

19

standards do not apply, but neither that court nor the

20

respondents contend that by their terms these detailed

21

provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act -- neither

22

of them contest that by their terms they would directly

23

apply and would prescribe review of the board's factual

24

findings under the substantial evidence standard set forth

25

in section 706(2) (E) of Title 5, set forth on page 5 of

our brief.
QUESTION:

2

Can I interrupt you, Mr. Wallace, and

3

I know you don't care for that very much, but let me do it

4

anyway.

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

Let's talk about the standard of the

7

scope of review under the statute, 706, which says that

8

under the APA the reviewing court will hold unlawful

9

agency action found to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse

10

of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law,

11

subsection (A).
Now I would have thought that was the standard

12

13

that we would be talking about.

14

having espoused that for years, has now backed off, says

15

no, it's under (E), unsupported by substantial evidence in

16

a case subject to sections 556 and 557 of this title or

17

otherwise reviewed on the record of an agency hearing

18

provided by statute.

19

situation.

20

Somehow the Government,

I don't see how (E) applies to this

Now, is the Government espousing that or what?

21

I mean, it's very peculiar and I'd like you to speak to

22

that for a minute, if you would.

23

MR. WALLACE:

One does not preclude the other.

24

We would not say that agency action should be upheld if

25

it's arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion.

We're not arguing that that standard is precluded.
QUESTION:

2

Well, why aren't you arguing that

3

it's required under the statute?

covers this situation -MR. WALLACE:

5

We --

I don't see how (E)

(E) --we think (E) comes in

6

because under the patent code, the court of appeals is

7

reviewing these determinations of the Board on the record

8

before the Board.

9

in the court of appeals is to be on the administrative

The patent code specifies that review

10

record, and while these are not hearings subject to

11

sections 556 and 557 of the act, they are in our view, and

12

we conceded before the en banc court, otherwise reviewed

13

on the record of an agency hearing provided by statute.

14

QUESTION:

That doesn't mean --

15

MR. WALLACE:

The Board proceedings are provided

16

for in the patent code, and --

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, I thought the

18

distinction was, indeed, I wrote a law review article on

19

this --

20

(Laughter.)

21

-- in the days when I knew something about

22

23

administrative law.
I thought that the distinction is that the

24

arbitrary-capricious standard, the first standard, applies

25

to all determinations, determinations of policy,

determinations of fact that are not based on a closed

2

record and so forth, and that the substantial evidence

3

test is merely one instance of what constitutes arbitrary

4

or capricious action when you are -- when you are making a

5

determination on a closed record.
That is to say, if you have a closed record and

6

7

there is not even substantial evidence in that record to

8

support your factual determination, substantial evidence

consists of with regard to fact-finding on a closed

record.

Thank you.

But this is just a

Well, good, if you agree, fine --- and I'd amend my answer to

Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

22

If you agree, then we come back to

23

the question that was asked about whether or not the

24

proceeding before the Patent Office is a proceeding on a

25

record.

proceeding of record?

I doubt it.

I very much doubt it.

10

Certainly I could find nothing that supports that it is.

11

Rather, it's like any other agency proceeding, say,

12

informal rulemaking, where of course you review it in a

13

court of appeals, informal rulemaking on the record before

14

the agency, but it was not in the sense of 556, 557, or

15

what I think is a second clause here, not record in that

16

sense.

17

So you can explain to me, what is this

18

proceeding like before the Patent Office.

19

like any record proceeding I've ever heard of.

MR. WALLACE:

It didn't sound

MR. WALLACE:

MR. WALLACE:

QUESTION:

Well, this is not rulemaking.

-- 550 -- I understand that.

But I

10

mean, on your definition of what (E) is, you're suddenly

going to get the substantial evidence standard applying in

a host of informal rulemaking proceedings reviewed by

about taking that --

15

MR. WALLACE:

That's what I'd worry about,

Well, I -- we would not go that

16

far.

We're -- we're dealing here with what amounts to a

17

form of rejection of a particular applicant's claim, an

18

adjudication of the particular claim.

19

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. --

20

QUESTION:

But of course, it doesn't matter, as

21

you agreed, since the substantial evidence test is simply

22

a version of the arbitrary or capricious test, that any

case that doesn't have even that minimum of substantial

24

evidence to get you to the jury, and is decided that way,

has to be arbitrary or capricious.

MR. WALLACE:

Is that the standard they

And I always thought maybe that was

a -- a standard that was more generous, really, to the

agency finding.

unless it's clearly erroneous.

14

they're telling us that that's more stringent than a

substantial evidence standard.

QUESTION:

MR. WALLACE:

Would you --

number of lawyers not familiar with this long-standing

1

MR. WALLACE:

What counts for purposes of this

2

case, since this is a determination of what -- of how

3

review should proceed in the Federal circuit, is the

4

understanding of the Federal circuit about the difference

5

between the two standards and why they're choosing one

6

standard rather than the other, and they explain that, I

7

think quite candidly, in the en banc opinion that they

8

were insisting on what we would term a more intrusive,

9

less deferential standard where they can proceed on their

10

own reasoning rather than in compliance with the standards

11

of the Administrative Procedure Act, which would require

12

them to determine the case not on the basis of their own

13

interpretation of the record transmitted to them, but on

14

the basis of whether the board's reasoning was justifiable

15

as not arbitrary or capricious --

16

QUESTION:

Well, if you'd -- if you'd take our

17

opinion in U.S. Gypsum, which was many, many years ago,

18

but there the Court said, I think, that clearly erroneous

19

gives the court more latitude than enough evidence to go

20

to the jury.

21

It said, although there's enough evidence to

22

support the verdict, the Court is convinced that a mistake

23

was made, and isn't that basically what we're talking

24

about here?

25

MR. WALLACE:

That -- I think that is precisely

the concept of the en banc court, that they have more

2

leeway to make their own determinations that otherwise

3

they would --

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Wallace, although that's true as

5

to the current members of that Court, is it not possible

6

that Justice O'Connor's suggestion would apply to the use

7

of clear error, those words, in all the cases decided

8

before 1947?
MR. WALLACE:

9

Well, that certainly is a way of

10

looking at them.

Those cases, as -- as we explain in our

11

reply brief, do not sharply differentiate between the two

12

standards of review that we have under discussion in this

13

case.

14

with a sentence or two about the propriety of def -- of

15

deferring to the technical expertise of the board in this

16

kind of proceeding.

17

QUESTION:

They will juxtapose a sentence about clear error

Well, it was well settled -- well

18

settled, wasn't it, that if the patent examiners were not

19

in agreement, did not concur, the predecessor to the court

20

of appeals for the Federal circuit would give a very

21

searching analysis of the record.

22

MR. WALLACE:

23

QUESTION:

That -- that was true --

And so they were consistent in that,

24

at least, but they were not consistent, we all know, in

25

the words they used.

MR. WALLACE:

1

The en banc court said that until

2

the early fifties, at least, the CCPA as it was called,

3

the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, had disparate

4

approaches to review.

5

QUESTION:

What -But that's not -- it seems to me that

6

that's fatal to your case.

I mean, you are asking us to

7

apply a provision which makes an exception to the normal

8

APA requirements, where there are additional requirements

9

imposed by statute or otherwise recognized by law.
Now, when you say, by law, I'm prepared to

10

11

acknowledge at least for the sake of argument that by law

12

doesn't mean just by statute, that it can mean by

13

practice.

14

and clear practice that it has the same kind of uniformity

15

and force as a provision in a statute, and I --

But it seems to me it must be such a consistent

16
17
18

MR. WALLACE:

But that was our contention,

precisely.
QUESTION:

But you say it's one way when there

19

are dissenting opinions in the board, it may be another

20

way in another case, that they may have been using clearly

21

erroneous to mean the same thing as substantial evidence

22

in some cases.

23

clarity that -- that this expression, by law, requires.

24
25

It doesn't seem to me to have the kind of

MR. WALLACE:

Well, that's the -- the other side

is arguing that it has that kind of clarity.

taking the position that this was not recognized --

of this provision, section 559, or -- the original section

QUESTION:

Mr. --Mr. Wallace --

QUESTION:

Let me ask you a question.

19

QUESTION:

-- I don't agree for this reason.

20

Clear error is the standard if we went from the PTO to the

21

district court, right?

22

MR. WALLACE:

23

QUESTION:

And then -Right.

And then the Federal circuit is

24

reviewing -- so, you have one mode of review where

25

undoubtedly the standard is clear error and my thinking

1

is, if there is any doubt, why should the standard vis-a-

2

vis the Federal circuit be different if you come to it

3

through another court, and one would think that you've had

4

an extra layer of review, that the Federal circuit at that

5

point should be more, not less deferential.

6

But if you go from the district court, you get

7

clear error and, if you go from the agency, you tell us

8

you get arbitrary and capricious or substantial evidence.

9

MR. WALLACE:

Well, when you say get clear

10

error, it depends on what you're talking about.

11

error is the standard of review by the court of appeals of

12

the district court's factual findings when the district

13

court has heard evidence on its own, but the case law, and

14

there's not a great deal of it, does indicate that when

15

you go from the PTO to the district court and don't ask

16

the district court to make findings on its own, but to

17

decide it on the basis of the board's record, that it's

18

then a -- not a trial de novo.

19

Clear

But we would argue that the district court, too,

20

should then be reviewing under the APA substantial

21

evidence standard, and I can refer the Court to two cases

22

on this subject.

23

in the District Court for the District of Columbia, at

24

page 569, and Gould v. Quigg, 822 F.2d 1074.

25

One is McKay v. Quigg, 641 F. Supp. 567,

Well, then you're suggesting that

it's really the would-be patentee's choice, because the

2

patentee could say, district court, look at the record

3

from the PTO, but I'm going to put in some other things.

4

So -MR. WALLACE:

5

There is that choice, which has

6

been a historical choice of proceeding by a bill in

7

equity, and the direct review proceeding was added later

8

on.

9

the Federal circuit.

The great bulk of applicants choose to go directly to
It's quite risky to go to the

10

district court, because it's not only the applicant who

11

can submit additional evidence; it's also the commissioner

12

who can submit additional evidence.

13

And rather than deal with one examiner who on

14

his own spent an average of two days looking into the

15

prior art, you might be faced with a team of lawyers

16

who've prepared the case with great care and have brought

17

in expert witnesses who will expose much more of the prior

18

art that could put your application at risk.

QUESTION:

And --

I don't understand what your position

20

is as to what the district court should do, if the person

does go the district.

is submitted, you use the substantial evidence test, but

if any additional -- one scrap of additional evidence is

submitted, then you review everything de novo and use a

You say, if no additional evidence

10

You use substantial evidence.
Right.

So you have two standards.
It's a hybrid proceeding, is what

those cases that I just said call it.
But I just wanted to finish my previous answer,

11

and the last sentence of 35 U.S.C. 145 says that the

expenses of the proceeding will be borne by the applicant,

all the expenses, and that includes the expenses of the

commissioner's expert witnesses.

Yes, but if you see that the price at

to me before.

When I looked at this complex I said, well,

21

gee, this favors the rich, because you go to district

22

court, if you can afford the time and the money, otherwise

23

you go to Federal circuit, which is faster and less

24

expensive if you go there directly, but you said that you

MR. WALLACE:

2

Correct, that the commissioner

will expand the record unless they are adversity

4

applicant, because the record can be expanded by either

5

party, whereas the applicant is in much greater control of

6

the record he's been making in the administrative

7

proceedings, which are basically ex parte, and there are

8

also ways of continuing the administrative proceeding and

9

then reapplying again under section 120.
So the great bulk of review is sought through

10
11

the direct route to the court of appeals for the Federal

12

circuit.

MR. WALLACE:

The Court makes law, as we hope it will in this

The fact that there's been fewer

before, saying the standard of review is not just some

8

Is there any other case where a court of appeals has said

9

that?

10

MR. GELLHORN:

Not to our knowledge, Your Honor.

11

However, I think it really relates to the standard of

12

obviousness, articulated by this Court in Graham v. John

13

Deere, where we have three questions that are put before

14

the agency and the Court in terms of determining

15

obviousness.

16

One, what were the claims made; two, what was

17

the prior art, the difference between the claims and the

18

prior art; and, third, would a person of ordinary skill in

19

this field have known that additional difference?

20

Now, all of that is presented to the Patent

21

Office and to the board on a written record.

cross-examination, there's no direct testimony, there are

no expert witnesses, and so what we have is a record that

somewhat more divided than that?

is united on that, and the summary is perhaps best

expressed in the New York Intellectual Property Lawyers

5

terminology, our reasoning, which was discussed earlier in

6

the questioning of Government counsel.
And while we wouldn't necessarily have selected

7
8

that word, we do think it does not undercut the opinion.

9

First of all, we could find no other decision by the CCPA

10

or the Federal circuit that used it, so I don't think it's

11

intimately affected with the clearly erroneous test.

12

addition, we believe it's actually inherent in the clearly

13

erroneous test because it was used initially by this

14

Court.

MR. GELLHORN:

In

What is the word you're referring to?
Our reasoning.

Our reasoning.

There was a

20

discussion earlier by the Court with Mr. Wallace on the

21

meaning of the term, our reasoning, and what does it mean

22

in connection with the clearly erroneous test.

23

And what I was seeking to explain was, that that

24

was not introducing some kind of new concept that was

25

unheard of.

In fact, it's origin, as far as we can tell,

is this Court's opinion in District of Columbia v. Pace, a

2

1944 decision.

QUESTION:

Well, it was a little odd.

I mean,

4

the C. A. Fed. seemed to say, we're not going to analyze

5

the reasoning of the Court of Patent Appeals.

6

going to look at our own.

7

MR. GELLHORN:

We're just

I thought it was very peculiar.
But if you look at the decision

8

of this Court in the Pace case, it uses the term that if

9

it's clear error, then there is no support in reason if

10

the second court could not make its finding as a result of

11

its own judgment.

12

means, we believe, is that the court applying the clearly

13

erroneous test is deciding for itself whether or not that

14

evidence is sufficient, and that's all.

15

And all that our reasoning linguage

As a consequence, the follow-on argument, which

16

is made by the Government, that this is somehow a

17

violation of the Chenery doctrine, we believe is an

18

erroneous reading of what happens.

19

under the clearly erroneous test is say that, you don't

20

have enough evidence, and the case is remanded back.

21

does not make its own findings.

22

terminology has no weight or holding in terms of reaching

23

this result.

What the court does

And therefore, that

Finally, we would point out that as a matter of
policy, the Federal circuit has made it clear that

consistency between review directly to it under section

2

141 from the Patent Office, and review to it through the

3

district court ought to have the same standard, that

4

Congress in 1982 made it clear that uniformity in the

5

patent law and its application was an important value,

6

and that it, along with the Administrative Procedure Act's

7

desire to strengthen the quality of review and the

8

standard of practice ought to be approved.
QUESTION:

9

But Mr. Wallace says that it's your

10

theory that would destroy the consistency, because he says

11

the district court ought to be applying a substantial

12

evidence test when there's no additional evidence

13

introduced.

What is your response to that?

MR. GELLHORN:

14

There is no basis, we believe, in

15

terms of applying that under the Administrative Procedure

16

Act, simply because in this instance we have, again, a

17

long-standing practice -- they acknowledge that -- from

18

going all the way back to 1894, because the decision in
