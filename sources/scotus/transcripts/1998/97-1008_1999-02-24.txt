ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN E. WALL, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:
Carolyn Cleveland, a stroke victim with a known

11

12

perceptive and expressive aphasia, a known language

13

disruption, didn't even get a chance to present her

14

Americans with Disabilities Act case, even though, or even

15

because, she had applied for Social Security disability

16

benefits.

17

case, in the McKenna case, Christine McKenna, who had

18

committed various infractions in the workplace, got to

19

present her case, and Carolyn Cleveland has not.

20

In a case very similar to Mrs. Cleveland's

In fact, Ms. McKenna received more favorable

21

treatment than Mrs. Cleveland in the fact that Mrs.

22

McKenna did not have to overcome a presumption.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

What is the bearing of the McKenna

action on the question presented here?
MR. WALL:

Mr. Chief Justice, the McKenna case,

as this Court is well aware, involved the issue of after-

2

acquired evidence.

3
4

QUESTION:

It involves what?

5

MR. WALL:

After-acquired evidence.

6

QUESTION:

It seems to me the difference is -- I

7

have the same concern as the Chief Justice apparently has

8

-- here you have an application, an official form.

9

would be like a judgment in some other hypotheticals we

10

might suppose.

11

cite.

That wasn't involved in the case that you

MR. WALL:

12

It

I agree, Your Honor.

The distinction

13

is in our particular case this evidence, these

14

representations, these general statements that were made

15

by Mrs. Cleveland to the Social Security Administration,

16

were discovered after the violation of the Americans with

17

Disabilities Act and somehow are used to presumptively

18

penalize Mrs. Cleveland from being able to bring action.

19

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Wall, do you think that

20

statements made by your client in making an application

21

for Social Security disability should be admissible as

22

evidence in the event of a subsequent ADA request?

23
24
25

MR. WALL:

I certainly believe they should, Your

QUESTION:

And if somebody such as your client

has said, I am totally disabled, that might be pretty

2

strong evidence, I suppose, even if you don't give it

presumptive effect?

disabled.

5

Presumably, that could change over time.

6

of the time she made the statement, that would be an

7

important piece of evidence, I suppose?

8

9

That's what she said:

I am totally

I suppose that that is some evidence.

MR. WALL:

But speaking as

It would be in the sense that at

various points in time she did have to say, in response to

10

various questions of the Social Security Administration,

11

words of that caliber or character.

12

particular situation here there was a period of time, as

13

the Court is well aware, that Mrs. Cleveland returned to

14

work and was physically capable of doing the job.

15

she been accommodated by her employer, there would have

16

been no necessity to resurrect her Social Security

17

disability claim.

18

QUESTION:

Now, in our

And had

Well, why shouldn't it be even more

19

than just strong evidence?

20

government agency that she is 100 percent disabled, why

21

doesn't that shift the burden to her to show that, even

22

though there are differences between what "disabled" means

23

under the Social Security Act and what it means under ADA,

24

why doesn't it shift the burden to her to show that those

25

differences are relevant in this case, that is to say that

If she has sworn to a

1

her statement did not take into account accommodation or

2

her statement was made at a later date or whatever?

3

doesn't it shift the burden to you

4

MR. WALL:

Why

it seems to me?

Well, I would think that that would

5

upset the normal summary judgment process here, being that

6

this is an affirmative defense raised by the respondent.

7

It is their burden to establish the essential elements of

8

their defense.

9
0

QUESTION:

Well, but the doctrine of judicial

estoppel does upset the normal process.

I mean, when you

11

have on the record testimony under oath in another, in

12

another government proceeding, we upset the normal

3

process.

4

she's

And here she's there under oath saying that

00 percent disabled.

5

Why isn't it reasonable to put the burden on her

6

to explain to the tryer of fact why that doesn't mean that

7

she's

8
9
20

00 percent disabled for purposes of the ADA?
MR. WALL:

I believe that she should be required

to explain it, as we did.
QUESTION:

But the question is is it just an

21

admission against interest that can come in along with all

22

the other evidence in the case or is it something more,

23

something that should actually shift the burden of proof?

24

MR. WALL:

I think not, Mr. Chief Justice.

25

QUESTION:

Why not?

MR. WALL:

1

The reason being is because people

2

who apply for Social Security disability may be victims of

3

Down's Syndrome, may be victims of dyslexia, may be

4

victims of brain damage, may be victims of strokes, may

5

have expressive and perceptive aphasia, as Mrs. Cleveland

6

does, may have any number of other psychomotor

7

abnormalities which may interfere with their normal

8

language perception.

9

QUESTION:

Well, they have enough normal

10

language perception to fill out the application, I take

11

it?
MR. WALL:

12

Well, the process as I understand it,

13

Mr. Chief Justice, is that this initial application that

14

was completed by Mrs. Cleveland here was compiled after a

15

telephone interview, and she signs it.

16

she would have the liberty, I suppose, in the normative

17

world to give further explanation as to what she may have

18

said.

And sure enough,

19

QUESTION:

20

facts are a little confusing.

21

initially had her stroke nobody knew whether she would

22

recover, because she wasn't -- at the time she had her

23

stroke, she had no memory, she could hardly talk.

24
25

With respect to that, Mr. Wall, the
I thought that when she

At what point did she file that application?
This is the kind of disability one may recover from and

1

one may not.

So had she -- had she made a startling

2

recovery by the time she filed that application?
MR. WALL:

3

No, Justice Ginsburg.

As a matter of

4

fact, the application for Social Security disability

5

benefits I believe was filed on or around January the 21st

6

of 1994, which was some 14 days after the onset of the

7

stroke.
QUESTION:

8

9
10

time?

MR. WALL:

At that point in time no one could

QUESTION:

And when she -- when her doctor told

tell.

13
14

Could anyone say whether she was going to get back

to any kind of non-disabled state?

11
12

What was the medical opinion at that

her that she could work, did she notify Social Security?

15

MR. WALL:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, she did.

She

16

wrote to them in April of 1994 and advised them that she

17

had returned to work.

18

QUESTION:

So I think that would be relevant,

19

too.

20

benefits, when she went back to work.

She was not claiming benefits, entitlement to

21

MR. WALL:

Precisely.

22

QUESTION:

Well, why couldn't all of that

23

evidence come in and nonetheless have the burden of proof

24

shifted by virtue of the application?

25

obviously could come in by way of explanation of why she

I mean, all of that

1

shouldn't be bound by this thing.
MR. WALL:

2

Well, the reason being, Mr. Chief

3

Justice, is that this unfairly, I would submit, submits

4

the burden upon the petitioner or the plaintiff in an ADA

5

case to disprove an affirmative defense raised by a

6

defendant.

7

QUESTION:

Well, but as Justice Scalia says, if

8

we were to apply any sort of judicial estoppel that would

9

be the effect.

10

And why not at least a halfway house here,

where you say the burden of proof is simply reversed?
MR. WALL:

11

Because it's not Mrs. Cleveland's

12

burden to prove or disprove an affirmative defense.

13

bear the burden of the preponderance of the evidence.

14
15

QUESTION:

They

But that doesn't deal at all with the

whole idea of judicial estoppel.

16

MR. WALL:

I agree.

17

QUESTION:

Well, I think you have to deal with

MR. WALL:

I agree, Your Honor.

18
19

it.
The reason we

20

would submit to the Court that this theory of judicial

21

estoppel should be discarded in the ADA-Social Security

22

Administration context is because of all of the reasons we

23

have enunciated for the Court here.

24
25

QUESTION:

That lots of people have disabilities

and so forth who file, who sign the applications?

1

MR. WALL:

I'm sorry, I missed.

2

QUESTION:

Well, you say for all the reasons

3

that you have assigned.

What are those reasons?

4
5

MR. WALL:

Well, number one, the Social Security

6

Administration never takes into consideration a reasonable

7

workplace accommodation at any stage of the game.

8

the information that's gathered, I would submit, from the

9

Social Security Administration passes through the filter

All of

10

of the Social Security Regulations and, as we know from

11

the amicus brief by the United States of America in this

12

case, those issues are never inquired about.

13

QUESTION:

Well, fine and she can bring in that

14

evidence as part of the rebuttal.

15

simply the only burden that's placed on her is to show

16

that the reason that this prior sworn statement does not

17

put her out of court here is because the accommodation

18

issue was the difference, that at that time had she taken

19

into account accommodation she wouldn't have made that

20

sworn statement.

I mean, the proposal is

That's the only burden put on her.

21

But if in fact accommodation is irrelevant to

22

the matter, then I don't know why she should be able to

23

swear one way one time and another way another time.

24
25

QUESTION:

May I ask, may I ask you what you

think that the -- is it the Fifth Circuit here -- Court of

1

Appeals held?

They spoke in terms of saying a rebuttable

2

presumption was created that would judicially estop your

3

client from asserting she was a qualified individual and

4

that she could overcome it, if at all, only under some

5

limited and highly unusual set of circumstances.
Do you think that the Fifth Circuit applied more

6

7

than just a simple burden shift, but rather a very strong

8

sort of a presumption?

9

MR. WALL:

Well, we know in light of --

10

QUESTION:

It isn't clear to me.

11

How do you

interpret that opinion?
MR. WALL:

12

Two ways, Justice O'Connor.

Number

13

one, the Fifth Circuit since the Cleveland decision was

14

enunciated has not ruled in favor of an ADA claimant,

15

period, on this issue.

16

highly unusual as far as their review.

17

QUESTION:

So clearly it is very limited and

Well, what if it were just a normal

18

burden shift?

Somebody has filed with an application for

19

a permanent disability, an application that says I'm

20

totally disabled.

21

rebuttable presumption, so that the burden shifts then to

22

the claimant to say, yes, I said that then, but in the

23

meantime I've recovered almost totally, and besides I

24

could be, with reasonable accommodation, I could be

25

employed?

Now, what if it were just an ordinary

1

Now, would that be okay?

2

MR. WALL:

Yes, Your Honor, and I think that's

3

precisely what happens in a normal summary judgment

4

setting.

5

defense would say:

6

otherwise qualified to perform this job with or without

7

accommodation, by reason of what you said to the Social

8

Security Administration.
QUESTION:

9
0

What would happen, I would envision, is the
You cannot establish that you're

But it would alter, it would alter

the summary judgment matrix, I take it, in one sense, that

11

you would lose, if you don't carry at least showing a

12

factual dispute about a point, rather than the other side

3

losing.

4

MR. WALL:

Precisely.

5

QUESTION:

Well, if you -- let's assume there is

6

no, there is no presumption, rebuttable presumption of

7

estoppel.

The other side files a motion for summary

8

judgment.

On the basis of the motion -- in support of the

9

motion for summary judgment, it presents through

20

affidavits the records of what your client had sworn to in

21

getting the Social Security benefits, and on the face that

22

evidence shows that your client says, I am disabled.

23

Do you agree that if you do nothing, if you

24

present no counter-affidavit, no counter-evidence, you're

25

going to lose the motion for summary judgment, right?

You

1

don't need a presumption to lose it; you're going to lose

2

it?

3
4
5

MR. WALL:

Perhaps, depending upon the filing

dates, Justice Souter, depending upon what's represented.
QUESTION:

So it's a difference, it's the timing

6

is perhaps the one respect in which it will make a

7

difference whether we have an enduring presumption or

8

whether we simply follow the normal rules of summary

9

judgment, which would require a response in order to

10

establish that there's a genuine issue.

11

what it boils down to?

12

MR. WALL:

Yes, sir.

Is that basically

Also there is this issue

13

that ever remains, and that's the issue of whether or not

14

workplace accommodation is taken into consideration.

15

light of the guidelines --

16

QUESTION:

In

Well, we all realize that it's not.

17

But I think it's also -- you may dispute this, but I was

18

assuming that it was fair to say that, even though the

19

legal standards of the two acts are different, in most

20

cases in which an individual says for Social Security

21

purposes, I'm disabled, that person probably is not going

22

to be in a position to work at the old job for ADA

23

purposes even with some accommodation.

24
25

I'm sure there are cases in which that is not
true, but I would suppose that as a general rule if you're

1

disabled for one you're probably not going to be able to

2

work with accommodation for the other, and therefore a

3

probability inference would be justifiable for summary

4

judgment purposes, i.e., you would raise an issue of fact

5

and if that fact was not rebutted you'd lose.
Am I wrong about the unlikelihood that you would

6

7

be disabled for Social Security and still be able to work

8

with some accommodation?

9

MR. WALL:

I would humbly disagree.

10

QUESTION:

What do we have -- do we have any

11

empirical evidence on it?

12

legally it's possible, no question about it.

13

in the real world how this tends to work out?

14

MR. WALL:

I mean, we all recognize that
Do we know

Unfortunately, no, and the reason

15

being is the question has never been as far as I can

16

understand analyzed on an empirical basis as to how many

17

people have been on Social Security disability, have tried

18

to remove themselves from the roll as a ward, and have

19

been unsuccessful in their effort to return to gainful

20

employment with accommodation.
QUESTION:

21

Is there any -- is there any study of

22

the Social Security program that allows people to keep

23

their disability benefits and yet work for this nine-

24

month trial period?

25

program?

How many people are enrolled in that

1

Have enrolled?

That I'm aware of,

2

no, Your Honor.

I'm sure there is the data available.

3

Unfortunately, I'm not able to provide it.
QUESTION:

4

But at least the two are not

5

inconsistent, because the law itself allows people who are

6

getting benefits to be working and keeping those benefits

7

for the, is it, nine-month period?
MR. WALL:

8

9

Precisely, to effectuate this

rehabilitation program, the nine-month period, the

10

intermittent periods of unsuccessful work attempt, the

11

efforts to go to some sort of rehabilitation program.
If I may, I would like to reserve the remainder

12

13

of my time for rebuttal if necessary.

1

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes, the Social Security

2

Administration doesn't consider reasonable accommodations

3

that have not been made.

4

whether a reasonable accommodation is necessary is very

5

fact-intensive, resource-intensive, and a time-consuming

6

effort, and it's one about which the Social Security

7

Administration doesn't have much expertise.

8

9

That's because the question of

Therefore, to do it would be detrimental to the
efficiency of the program, and that efficiency is critical

10

to the program because the Administration handles about

11

two and a half million claims a year, which is about ten

12

times as many cases as go in the Federal court system.

13

In addition to that --

14

QUESTION:

You could -- you could not take it

15

into account in the initial granting of benefits, but

16

allow it to be refuted later on, it seems to me.

17

find it extraordinary that we have a law here which

18

requires employers to make accommodations to disabled

19

persons and yet your agency is giving away money under

20

the, under the Social Security disability provisions

21

presumably to people who are entitled to those

22

accommodations and who therefore are employable, but

23

you're just closing your eyes to the fact that the

24

employer must make accommodations.

25

It just doesn't make any sense at all.

The law

3

MR. ROBERTS:

It's just your

The Social Security Administration

4

has interpreted the law to permit it to consider the jobs

5

as they actually exist and the jobs as they existed.

6

in addition to the efficiency reason that I stated before

7

to Justice Kennedy, there are additional reasons, because

8

the purpose of the Social Security Act, which is also a

9

purpose of the ADA, is to try to enable people to move off

10

And

the benefit rolls and return to work.
QUESTION:

11

Well, of course, the Social Security

12

Act, there are substantial hearings on whether or not the

13

applicant can pursue any kind of gainful employment, and

14

the Administration just closes its eyes to the employer's

15

duty to accommodate?

16

I just don't understand that.

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor, it doesn't close

17

its eyes.

the jobs are ordinarily performed in the national economy

19

or as the past job was performed.

MR. ROBERTS:

2

Well, that's required by the

statute, Your Honor, and the purpose of that provision in

4

the statute is to enable people to test their ability to

return to work.
QUESTION:

Well, so there's a real incentive for

someone certainly to apply for Social Security disability,

but also to pursue whatever rights there are under ADA.

MR. ROBERTS:

Congress certainly intended the

possibility of people doing both.

QUESTION:

Let me ask you whether you think that

it is workable in the government's view to have just a

presumption that shifts the burden of proof based on an

disability.

look at the reasonable accommodation.
MR. ROBERTS:

2

That would mean that in the

3

borderline cases there would be a risk that the claimant

would lose, which would be contrary to the policy of the

possible.

MR. ROBERTS:

2

A presumption might be appropriate

3

if there was a reason to believe that there was an

4

inconsistency that arises simply from the application or

5

the receipt of benefits.

6

that there's that inconsistency.
QUESTION:

7

But there's no reason to believe

Well, I mean, there certainly is.

8

You have to say that, well, the one reason why there may

9

not be, the one reason why there may not, is that it may

10

not have taken into account accommodation.

11

may be the case in how many percentages of the cases, do

12

you think?

13

MR. ROBERTS:

You know, that

Well, in 40 percent, 42 percent of

14

the cases that people who had Social Security disability

15

benefits returned to work, their employer made an

16

accommodation.

17

is in a large percent of cases.

18

60 percent of Social Security disability benefit

19

determinations, awards, are made at step three of the

20

process, which is at the state of listed impairments.

21

in that case the Administration presumes that somebody is

22

entitled to benefits without any inquiry into their

23

ability to do their past job or their ability to do other

24

employment in the national economy.

25

So I think that there is evidence that it

impairments that, while most people might not be able to

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. MORRISON:

12

13

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

14

The courts will continue to be faced with the

15

obvious tension between the Social Security Administration

16

definition of "disability" and the ADA.

17

continue to find some cases where this is -- the Social

18

Security Administration records should be dispositive, and

19

the courts will need a sensitive and sensible tool to deal

20

with that.

21

They will

That sensitive and sensible tool should begin

22

with the fact that the under oath statements to the Social

23

It was not a presumption that rested upon the terms

MR. MORRISON:

QUESTION:

Justice Souter, I think it relied

specifically to application or award of benefits, not to

Am I wrong?

Justice Souter, that is the

reference in the case.

6

MR. MORRISON:

Okay.
However, the rebuttable

presumption would be a sensitive tool to require the

courts to go down into the record and look at the

statements, because if the rebuttal was made the court

would then look at the context of the statements that were

made.

QUESTION:

Okay, and that gets to the suggestion

that I was going to make and ask you to comment upon,

Let's assume that the person has applied for the

Social Security benefits and later makes an ADA claim.

4

There's a motion for summary judgment made by the

defending party in the ADA claim and what that summary

6

judgment says, the motion says,

7

the plaintiff,

Social Security benefits that he was totally disabled, or

whatever it was,

is this:

The applicant,

that the applicant used.

If the applicant makes no response to that,

time.

3

QUESTION:

Isn't the difference that the

4

evidence which this presumption requires is not evidence

that he is now able to work with accommodation, but

6

evidence to show that his prior statement was not

perjurious?

8

MR. MORRISON:

9

QUESTION:

Exactly, Justice Scalia.

And if it was perjurious then he's

out of court.

11

MR. MORRISON:

12

QUESTION:

Exactly, Justice Scalia.

And do you think that if the rule is

3

otherwise he is going to ignore the risk of having his

4

earlier statements regarded as being genuinely

5

inconsistent and hence raising a presumption of perjury?

6

I would assume no, he's going to explain it.

7

case the issue that ends up in the lap of the court is

going to be exactly the same,

9

MR. MORRISON:

So in any

it seems to me.

Justice Souter, the statements

20

that are made have to be given weight or credit in the

course -- he can't just come in and say,

I didn't mean it,

3

a statement has to be given credit or power without

placing it in some -- the litigation context.

I mean, it really doesn't do a lot of good to say

These matters, Chief Justice

Rehnquist, will arise frequently at the summary judgment

stage, and essentially what we would suggest is what the

I think he's still answering the

And when that occurs, when that

occurs, then the rebuttable presumption comes into play

to go forward.

against the Social Security Administration, because they

MR. MORRISON:

In other words, the party is presumed judicially estopped,

there was never any court proceeding.

MR. MORRISON:

It went for 18 months, all the

During that 18 months she continually represented that she

was totally and completely disabled from all work in the

Mr. Morrison, do you assume that it's

the interest of SSI to have the people who are on the

that are false at that stage are going to cause trouble

later on will not make those statements at that stage.

MR. MORRISON:

9

QUESTION:

Exactly my point.

But is your point any different than

10

-- I hate to say this, but I don't understand what the

11

disagreement is about.

12

everybody saying, yeah, we agree to that; one thing an

13

applicant cannot do is go in and say, wait, I am disabled,

14

Social Security Administration, and then later in the next

15

suit they can't come in and say, oh, no, no, no, what I

16

said before was false.

I thought I heard the SG and

17

Everybody says they can't say that.

18

could say is, yes, yes, I did say I was disabled, I was

19

disabled for purposes of the Social Security Act, that

20

means I couldn't hold any job in the economy, and I'd like

21

to tell you something; I just did it under subpart P,

22

where they don't really look to see whether there's some

23

other job somewhere, that's why.

business is properly accommodating.
But they have to say something like that, and

2

3

they can't just say, I didn't tell the truth before or

4

sweep it under the rug.
Now, if they agree to that and you agree to

that, why don't we end this case?
QUESTION:

7

What's this about?

Have they agreed to that, Mr.

8

Morrison?

Again, I question the premise.

I thought -- I

9

thought that what they would say is, I'm entitled to come

10

in with evidence to show that I currently am entitled to

11

accommodation and I can do the work with accommodation.

12

Now, you're entitled to bring in that statement in the

13

past and that'll go to the factfinder for whatever it's

14

worth.

the past was false --

Those

And under those circumstances, the rebuttable

presumption should come into play and she should be

16

required to explain that in some way.

QUESTION:

If she cannot --

Mr. Morrison, the problem I have with

18

your explanation is that as I read the Fifth Circuit

with an explanation.

and highly unusual set of circumstances can it be

rebutted.

I don't understand that.

That seems to be more

than burden shifting, more than allowing her to come in

with a reasonable explanation.

MR. MORRISON:

MR. MORRISON:

Justice O'Connor, under those

do not articulate that as a standard.

Don't defend that as the standard?

had sworn to that over a period of 18 months, that she was

In this case there was not only a showing

It seems to me that implicit in what the Fifth

latter, to discourage false statements, and that's what

judicial estoppel is for, I suppose.

MR. MORRISON:

Justice Kennedy, the primary goal

is to focus on the search for the truth, and in that you

cannot ignore past statements under oath.

MR. MORRISON:

It's more than an admission

to the current position being taken.

terms of art.

She was talking about disability for the

Social Security Act in terms of disability as understood

through step three of the process of certification.

4

MR. MORRISON:

5

QUESTION:

It's through step five.

Well, I thought -- at any rate,

6

through the steps, whatever number.

And for purposes of

7

ADA she's simply using the word in a different fashion.

8

One reason that has been suggested in the briefs, although

9

that's not what we're here to resolve, but I mean one

10

reason that's been suggested in the briefs is that in her

11

Social Security application she was using form language.

12

In other words, she was using the language of Social

13

Security's own application.

14

ultimately a satisfactory explanation.

15

That may or may not be
I have no idea.

But isn't that a further reason for saying we

16

ought to think twice before we set up presumptions,

17

because in fact if people use the terms of statutes the

18

way the statutes are written and the terms are not

19

inconsistent with each other, even though they might seem

20

to be in normal English, we don't want to penalize

21

somebody by setting up this presumption?

22

What is your answer to that argument?

23

MR. MORRISON:

Justice Souter, it is not

24

sufficient to say that this case involves just the

language on the record.

that, and I think the better answer to that is that she is

2

required under the Social Security Act to tell her

4

I can't process information and data.

And what she said is,

She was a telephone operator taking telephone

couldn't take in the information, process it through the

But your answer is, number one, she

didn't just confine herself to the forms, and I take it

your answer is no one, in effect, can plead that as an

applicant he was just using forms, because you have to

9

make discursive statements in which you tell facts not

10

repeating formal language.

Is that basically it?

11

MR. MORRISON:

Exactly, Justice Souter, exactly.

12

So when we look at this matter altogether and we

13

begin to focus on what the individual test would require

in this case, we find that she's made this series of

statements, and then you come back to her statement in the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN E. WALL, JR.

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. WALL:

23

The very troubling notion that's posed here by

Mr. Chief Justice, please the Court:

24

the respondent in this case is that somehow the matrix of

25

the summary judgment system should be reinvented.

As a

practical matter, the presumption arises once the motion

is filed.

3

disabled, the motion is filed, the evidence comes forward

4

in the form of the claim file, and then the explanation

5

must be made.

What we have is a complaint filed by the

QUESTION:

6

Must it be made?

I'd like to clarify

7

whether Justice Breyer's assumption of your position is

8

correct.

9

summary judgment proceedings the plaintiff establishes

Do you acknowledge that, even though in the

10

that she currently could do the work with an

11

accommodation, even though she establishes that,

12

nonetheless if she does not establish that she was not

13

lying previously she loses?

14

MR. WALL:

Well --

15

QUESTION:

Suppose you come in with all the

16

evidence that shows she can be accommodated, but what you

17

haven't done is explain the contrary statement she made

18

earlier.

Do you lose?

19

MR. WALL:

I think not.

20

QUESTION:

I didn't think you thought so.

21

QUESTION:

If you take out the word "currently."

22

Sorry, then I didn't understand it.

23

day one your client has filed an application for Social

24

Security saying, I'm totally disabled.

25

in court and she says, I want to tell you about day one.

I thought you said on

On day two she's

On day one, the same day, I want to win under the ADA, and

2

they say, what about your application to Social Security?

3

She says, I'm not telling you a word about that, I refuse

4

to explain it.

5

All right.

Now, does your client win or not?

6

7

MR. WALL:

Loses.

8

QUESTION:

Fine, okay.

9

Add something else.

In

the context of the summary judgment motion, although she

10

doesn't explain the prior statement, she puts in a ton of

11

evidence that demonstrates quite conclusively that her

12

current condition can be accommodated.

13

lose?

Does she win or

14

MR. WALL:

She wins.

QUESTION:

I missed that.

I rest, I rest my case.

(Laughter.)

20

MR. WALL:

Your time has expired.

The frightening proposition here is

21

is that somehow these people for whom Mrs. Cleveland is

22

the voice, the voice of one, the disabled, who cry from

23

the wilderness, the wilderness of the world if the

24

disabled, is that they are presumed to have lied.

25

a fundamental problem with that concept, particularly in

I have

1

light of the fact that the Social Security Administration

2

doesn't ask these questions that arise in the ADA, never

3

inquires about accommodation.

4

In the normative, in the ideal world, what would

happen here is in Mrs. Cleveland's case there would have

been a referral from the investigator at the Texas

Rehabilitation Commission to the EEOC and they would have

sent the enforcement division there.

10

QUESTION:

But that doesn't

But I thought it's been conceded that

11

if all that she's done is to make the conclusory

12

allegation that tracks the language of the statute that

13

she's disabled, that that would not trigger this, this

14

alteration in the summary judgment matrix.

15

she makes very concrete statements -- I have been unable

16

to do, I have been unable to lift my arm, I have been

17

unable to do work.

19

MR. WALL:

It's only when

That's not terms of art.
It still never inquires, Your Honor,

about the question of accommodation.

The case is submitted.
