ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND J. LaJEUNESSE, JR.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents three issues under the

14

National Labor Relations Act.

15

its duty of fair representation by negotiating a contract

16

that falsely tells employees they must be union members

17

and pay full dues to keep their jobs when this Court has

18

held, and the union concedes, that neither of those

19

requirements may lawfully be enforced?

20

First, does a union breach

The second question is whether the National

21

Labor Relations Board has exclusive jurisdiction over a

22

performer's claim that the Screen Actors Guild, or SAG,

23

breached its duty of fair representation by negotiating a

24

contract that misinforms performers who have been employed

25

in the motion picture industry for 30 days or more that

1

they must meet their union obligations under a union

2

security clause immediately upon hire by any employer in

3

that industry.

4

And third, is the employer a necessary party in

5

this case because the plaintiff employee is seeking

6

reformation of the misleading contract provisions?

7

I will submit the last issue on the briefs today

8

and only address the first two issues, because neither the

9

union nor the employer has opposed our arguments on the

10

third issue.

Of course, I'll be glad to answer any

11

questions that the Court has throughout any of the three

12

issues.

13

The first question is whether this contract

14

breaches the duty of fair representation on its face,

15

because it says that more is required of employees as a

16

condition of employment than can lawfully be required.

QUESTION:

That's my point, Your Honor.

A lawyer can be expected to

What other portions of the contract

that are very intricate have to be spelled out for the

10

employee?

I mean, is that the obligation of the union, to

11

make every provision of a contract that affects the

12

employee clear to the employee?

13

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

My goodness.

No, Your Honor.

Well, where do we draw the line?
We draw the line at the union

16

security clause, because that is the only provision of the

17

contract as to which the interests of the individual

18

employee are adverse, and as to which the union has a duty

19

to inform employees truthfully and fully as to what their

20

rights and obligations are.

QUESTION:

Well -- go on.

2

contract, a sufficient response to the problem that you

3

raise?

4

6

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

I don't believe so, Justice

Souter, because the contract is the basic law of the shop.
QUESTION:

No, but the fact is, the employee is

7

quite un -- is far less likely to read the contract than

8

to have contact with union representatives, who have, as

9

you acknowledge, an obligation to explain,

in fact, what

10

those terms mean and what the employee's real obligation

11

is, so it seems to me that you're arguing for a formality

12

which the average employee is likely, unlikely even to

13

take notice of.

14

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

I don't believe that I'm

15

arguing for a formality, Your Honor.

16

this Court held in Beck and has held in other cases, the

17

union has a duty to act fairly with regard to all

18

employees in the bargaining unit both in negotiating the

19

contract and in enforcing it and --

20
21

QUESTION:

I believe that, as

What does that say with negotiating

the contract?

22

I wasn't aware that Beck -- if Beck said that

23

there has to be in the contract this clause that you're

24

urging there would be nothing to argue about, but my

25

understanding is that the contract not only reflects the

language of the statute but the NLRB's -- what it was --

2

is it Keystone Coat, or whatever it is, their model

3

clause.
And the NLRB still hasn't gotten around to

4
5

replacing that model clause, so whatever else this is, how

6

can it be a violation of the duty of fair representation

7

to keep in the contract what the NLRB and the statute say

8

is okay, as long as the union notifies anyone who doesn't

9

want to be a member that, right, you don't have to be a

10

member?
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

11

12

There are two points to your

question, Your Honor.

13

First, you say that the National Labor Relations

14

Board hasn't replaced it.

15

replaced it, but in Electronic Worker's Local 444 in 1993,

16

more than a year before SAG negotiated this contract with

17

this employer, the board overruled the Keystone Coat

18

clause, saying that it was, in fact, ambiguous and would

19

have the effect of misleading employees.

It's true that the board hasn't

And secondly, with regard to the statute itself,

20
21

the statute is not just what the statute says, after this

22

Court has authoritatively interpreted it and placed a

23

judicial gloss on it, which as Judge Posner and the

24

Seventh Circuit said actually inverted the meaning of the

25

statute.

The employee isn't going to know what that

The contract would say --

QUESTION:

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

4

Well, Mr. LaJeunesse ---go read the statute, and

they'd still be misled.
QUESTION:

5

Suppose -- suppose the contract had

6

been written with all the complicated things you want in

7

there, so that she would have had to come up with, what,

8

$485 instead of $500 to join the union, she still wouldn't

9

have gotten the job, because she didn't have the money.

10

How was she injured by the contract?
MR. LaJEUNESSE:

11

Well, she was injured because

12

the casting agent in this case enforced the contract as it

13

was written, saying, you are not going to work tomorrow if

14

you don't pay the full amount demanded by the union by

15

5:00 this afternoon.

16

QUESTION:

Yes, the point is, I guess -- you say

17

the correct amount would have ben $485 instead of $500 and

18

the contract could have made that clear, but she didn't

19

have $485 either, so she still wouldn't have gotten the

20

job.

21

written as you want it written?

How did the contract hurt her, even if it had been

days.

would have been paid by the employer, and then she could

have paid the union.

By that time she would have done the job and she

Is that - MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Correct, Your Honor.

That's

the first answer.
And the second answer is that this contract is

14

15

a standard form contract that it uses with all employers,

16

18

production, and she --

the obligation even if Beck had been applied in the

drafting of the contract, as you say it should be, where

4

is her harm?

I think it was a Beck question.

QUESTION:

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

decisions to hire or fire don't know and they, like the

casting agent in this case, look to the language of the

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

Everybody agrees that's the

The only question is, must they put it in the

contract, and I think we can all agree that most people

don't read the collective bargaining contracts, but they

will read the union's newsletter that will say it ought to

pay the full dues.

MR. LaJEUNESSE:

the wrong information.

It's going to say, you're obligated to become a

affirmative obligation to tell her that she doesn't have

to do that, so that isn't the answer to your answer to

Justice Scalia simply the recognition that the union

will not refuse every single time to fulfill its

by the union in Beck, Your Honor, and this Court said in

Beck that the union, in negotiating the contract or

enforcing it, had breached the duty of fair representation

implementation in terms of the collection of excessive

has to do with the implementation of the clause, the

standard of irrationality, or beyond the range of

the Beck case, as you may recall, a theory of the

2

plaintiff in the Beck case was based on three reasons, one

3

that there was a violation of 8(a)(3) and 8(b)(2) and

4

therefore, per se, then there was a violation of the duty

5

of fair representation.
And second was that there was a constitutional

6

7

question, and third that there was a pure and simple duty

8

of fair representation that had to do with how the union

9

collected its dues and whether it collected excess amount

10

of dues over objections of an employee for political

11

purposes.
The Court very clearly -- in fact, I think this

12

13

was a unanimous opinion where the centrists also agreed

14

with this part of the Beck case that the claim as to the

15

constitutional issue was not to be decided, it was put

16

aside, that clearly the Beck Court said that the issue of

17

being an unfair labor practice, and that in itself, a

18

violation of 8(a)(3), 8(b)(2), made it a violation of the

duty of fair representation, was not the law and was not

great discussion of how you find the standard.

up duty of fair representation as a violation of 8(a)(3),

It's a

It's a question of how the complaint is worded.

11

When you cut through the substance of it, the

12

substance of it is, there has to be a finding, and this

13

should be done by the labor board first, and of course

14

reviewed by the courts, is that when the parties

15

negotiated this contract that said 30 days, did they

16

violate 8(a)(3) and 8(b)(2)?

17

Now the NLRB has to look at a numerous number of

18

factors. They have to look at the industry, they have to

look at employment practices, as I said earlier the multiÂ­

employer unit question -- that is not a function of the

Well, of course, in the context of

10

the factual situation of Beck, which was really decided

essentially that there's a separate duty of fair

The board could have concurrent

QUESTION:

3

-- could a line be drawn this way,

that by recognizing that the decision in Beck, the

5

construction of the statute that the Court announced in

Beck was at least driven by a concern over First Amendment

issues.

9

And, therefore, could we say that if, in fact,
the argument that is brought is an argument which

10

depends -- which would -- if it's a statutory

11

interpretation argument, that would depend on, or turn on

12

a concern over constitutional issues, perhaps avoiding

13

constitutional issues, that that would be an appropriate

14

case to bring in the first instance in a court under fair

15

representation because that's not the labor board's

principle subject of expertness, whereas if the

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. GEFFNER:

9

-- in constitutional terms.
I'm not sure of that, Your Honor,

but the problem in terms of avoiding constitutional

10

issues, which of course Beck said it was not involved in

11

the Beck case, but I think I agree with Justice Souter

12

that in referring back to the Street case and the Railway

13

Labor Act, which Beck was based on, that there were at

14

least in the background somewhere some constitutional

15

issues about collecting money from people over their

16

objections for political activities.

17

But beyond that, it seems to me that the

18

constitutional questions really are not faced in this

19

area, because any doubt -- any doubt, even if you want to

20

raise it to the dignity of a constitutional question, is

21

resolved by the point that was made, I believe, by Justice

22

Ginsburg, and that is, the union is required, and there's

a very clear body of law that has developed in the last

few years by the NLRB and also by the courts in

an affirmative obligation for the union to notify every

2

person that's subject to the union security clause of

3

their Beck rights.
In fact, they go even further.

4

They have to

5

advise them of numerous rights that flow from the Beck

6

decision.

7

that a contract might do, as I believe one of the Justices

8

pointed out, because that obligation that the board, the

9

labor board is now imposing has to be shown that the

11

That is an obligation that goes beyond anything

individual received that notice.
Whether through a newspaper, or whether through

12

a mailer, or whether through an application form, whatever

question, or to Justice Scalia's question that perhaps in

4

the background when the Court decided the Beck case there

5

was some concern of a constitutional question, but it

6

didn't involve political activities and collecting dues

7

for political activities.
And the Beck case clearly tagged on to the

8

9

i was responding, I believe to Justice Souter's

Street case, which is a Railway Labor Act case, which did

10

involve a constitutional issue because of the statute

11

being drafted and written separately and differently from

12

the Taft-Hartley Act, which the Beck case didn't -- it did

13

not involve the constitutional issue.

14

But I simply agree with Justice Scalia that

15

somehow you could look up in the sky and pick that issue

16

out of there.

17

But clearly the holding of the Beck case was not

18

on constitutional questions.

that the standard that would be applied, that may be a

the duty of fair representation really something that's

separate from a pure statutory violation, that there's

some -- because the duty of fair representation was really

After the Beck case and the

9

they said the ambiguity is cleared up and remedied by

Now they say it's

10

these outside notices that have to be given to the

11

individuals, so that clarifies the ambiguity.

12

Now, the D.C. circuit reversed the board and

13

said no, that -- the clause is not ambiguous, the clause

14

is facially valid, and reversed the board on that issue,

15

and now the board is wrestling with the consequences of

16

that for that decision, and there's some dissention in the

board itself, actually, on that issue right now, but cases

clearly that's ambiguous, that's their position, but not

petitioners are asking in this case, to declare a

to unilaterally just modify a collective bargaining

It's not the reality of labor relations.

renegotiate with the employer.
