ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL W. McCONNELL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McCONNELL:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
As you know, in this case there are two

11

12

questions presented, one having to do with the State

13

action doctrine, one having to do with procedural due

14

process.

15

of these theories, I'd like to begin by urging this Court

16

to reach both of these questions.

And although my clients could prevail on either

17

Certainly the Court has authority to reach both

18

because even if the private insurance companies are found

19

to -- not to be State actors and, thus, to have no further

20

liability in the case, there do remain other parties in

21

the case, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the School

22

District of Philadelphia, and they are -- they are

23

certainly affected by the due process holding in and of

24

itself.

25

But more important -QUESTION:

MR. McCONNELL:

petitions were denied.

this Court pursuant to this Court's rules.

Their

They are, of course, parties in

More important, from our point of view, is the

5
6

effect upon the system in Pennsylvania were this Court to

7

leave -- to affirm on the State action question but to

8

leave the due process holding of the Third Circuit in

9

place.

10

There is a single, comprehensive, integrated

11

workers' compensation system in Pennsylvania that involves

12

both government employers and private employers, both

13

private insurance companies and a government insurance

14

company with exactly the same rules and obligations

15

applying to all of them and, very importantly, with risk

16

sharing among them in the form of assessments that are --

17

that are put into a fund for the purpose of dealing with

18

the -- with the risk of providing -- of medical providing

19

of unnecessary and unreasonable care.

20

QUESTION:

Should --

Mr. McConnell, from what you've said,

21

it seems to me that if the due process question were

22

decided in your favor --as you mentioned, you have the

23

State insurance fund in there and public employers.

24

the due process question is decided in your favor, isn't

25

the State action question academic?

MR. McCONNELL:

1

Your Honor, that may very well

2

be true.

I do think that the State action question is

3

logically prior, and so I assume that the Court must reach

4

that question first, but in terms of full relief -- excuse

5

me.
QUESTION:

6

That was the way we decided Jackson

7

v. Metropolitan Edison.

8

the State action question first because we thought it was

9

prior, but we did not go on to decide the due process

10

We have the State -- we decided

question.
MR. McCONNELL:

11

Yes, Your Honor, although in the

12

-- in the San Francisco Athletic case, the Gay Olympics

13

case, the Court did both decide a State action question

14

and the First Amendment question which was logically

15

related to -- to the two.

16

certainly has authority --

MR. McCONNELL:

21

So, the Court -- the Court

Lower courts, fortunately,

aren't free to say that, Justice Kennedy.
Well, if I can now turn to the State action

issue.

At stake in this doctrinal question is whether to

constitutionalize major aspects of the administration of

then quintessential questions of regulatory policy that

are now decided by private parties subject to regulation

QUESTION:

If these issues involve State action,

What's your best argument to

8

distinguish Tulsa Professional Collection?

9

to be one of the cases that's closely on point.

10

MR. McCONNELL:

It seems to me

Well, Your Honor, in -- in Tulsa

11

-- an ordinary private citizen, such as the administrator

12

of an -- of an estate does not have the power to -- to

13

end, to cut off the rights of their creditors.

14

not something that private citizens can do on their own.

15

In Tulsa, they go to the State and the State provides the

16

active assistance that enables them to accomplish this

17

result, that is, cutting off their creditors' claims, that

18

they couldn't do on their own.

That is

In our case, by contrast, private companies

regularly withhold the payments to -- pending resolution

of -- of disputes.

cutting it off all together and simply deferring payment?
MR. McCONNELL:

2

Well, Your Honor, it has to do

3

with -- what the -- what the private party can do is

4

withhold payment pending some kind of legal process that

5

comes down the road, which is, of course, the standard

6

practice with insurance.

7

involved in a fender bender and you have a dispute with

8

your insurance company, the insurance company will decline

If you have -- if you're

to pay, and then -- and you will have some sort of a cause
10

of action against the insurance company.

11

that's going on in this case.

That is all

In fact, rather than State assistance in this

12

13

case, all we have is -- is a limitation on what would

14

otherwise be the perfectly private right of a private

15

company to withhold payments pending resolution of a

16

private dispute.

17

as well as other cases, that regulation of private

18

activity does not make that activity into -- into State

1

action.

20

And the Court was very clear in Jackson,

Well, that is true if you focus just

21

on the specific action here, to wit, failing to pay

their private State tort action as part of the overall

workmen's comp scheme?

State action?
MR. McCONNELL:

4

Does that bring this any closer to

Well, Your Honor, workers'

compensation is a substitute for private tort, but that

seems to support our contention that this is private

action.

Workers' compensation has a different set of

negligence liability, and has a somewhat different set of
10

procedurals, a streamlined administrative procedure

We wouldn't because it might be advisory.

MR. McCONNELL:

Third Circuit and who are confessedly State actors.

scheme, you all contribute to the fund for, whatever you

3

call it, recoupments by companies that pay and then later

4

are determined not -- not to have been liable, so that the

amount that you have to contribute to that fund will vary,

I suppose, depending on how the due -- could vary,

depending on how the due process point comes out.
MR. McCONNELL:

8

Because in -- as I understand the

Souter.

That's exactly right, Justice

The -- the risks of -- of these mispayments, that

10

is payment for medical care that turns out not to be --

11

not to be reasonable and necessary, is borne by the system

12

as a whole, private insurers as well as public insurers.

13

So, we have a direct financial interest in the outcome as

14

applied to the government parties in this case as well.

15

But as this -- as the discussion so far has

16

already indicated, that this case is a -- does not involve

17

a traditional public function in any -- in any sense.

18

That is to say, neither the provision of workers'

19

compensation nor the specific decision in this case to

20

suspend payments in what amounts to a commercial dispute

21

is traditionally a public function, let alone an exclusive

22

public function.

the State is involved in -- in requiring certain filings

possible that the insurer might pay for treatment, let's

12

say, chiropractic treatments, over a period of months and

13

then conclude maybe it should suspend further payment and

14

raise the question of whether it's reasonable and

15

necessary?

16

Under the Pennsylvania system, is it

MR. McCONNELL:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

The

17

assumption here is that a course of medical treatment

18

that's appropriate in one month is not necessarily

1

reasonable or necessary in some other period.

Is every payment a new issue, if you

will, or not?

payment, Your Honor, and so when the doctor submits the

2

bill, the insurance company decides whether -- if there's

3

no question about its appropriateness, they simply pay

4

within the 30-day period.

5

some question, then they submit it for utilization review

6

and withhold payment pending that.

7

If they believe that there's

And that brings us to the due process issue,

8

because I'd like to be -- like to talk about what is the

9

impact on the individual worker of this kind of a -- of a

10
11

-- of an arrangement.
QUESTION:

Note that the -Yes, because if the worker were

12

receiving some kind of a series of medical treatments and

13

thought at least that it was helping and then, all of a

14

sudden, it suspended, is there some kind of a -- an

15

expectation that we have to weigh in the balance?

16

MR. McCONNELL:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

17

that people automatically assume that just because they've

18

been receiving a course of treatment that it necessarily

19

is going to be something that they have forever.

20

But let me be more specific about that because I

21

think it's important to distinguish between the effect on

22

the treatments that have already been received and then

23

for the future.

24
25

For those that have already been received, the
worker is essentially not affected.

The question is, is

the doctor going to be paid?

The focus of this litigation

2

has been on the indirect effect, the fear that because of

3

the process being invoked, that their medical provider

4

might choose not to provide further treatments in the

5

future.

6

assumption that a suspension in payment was tantamount to

7

terminating the medical benefits, but I think any

8

reflection upon that will show that that is simply not the

9

case.

And the Third Circuit seemed to operate on the

What the medical provider has to do, the medical

10
11

provider becomes on notice that someone is going to be

12

examining the reasonableness and necessity of the course

13

of treatment.

14

provide the treatment if he believes that an impartial

15

process will conclude that it's reasonable and necessary.

16

It's only in the case where the medical provider himself

17

realizes that the bill in the end is likely not to be

18

payable that -- that the medical -- that the course of

19

treatment will be -- not be provided.

And that medical provider will continue to

But, Your Honor --

QUESTION:

Do you say this as a matter of logic

22

or experience?

There are other States that have a similar

regime.

concerned about not being paid by anyone and so indeed

suspend treatment?

MR. McCONNELL:

1

Your Honor, I think it's a

matter of the logical implication of this -- of this

statutory scheme.

conclusion of -- of full process is that the -- that the

5

medical procedures are reasonable and necessary, and they

will be compensated for the delay in payment by 10 percent

or the provider would not continue treatment is if he had

some doubt about the -- the outcome of that proceeding.

The doctors will be paid if the

The only reason that the doctor would --

And far from being a denial of due process, Your

10
11

would comport with due process.
As to the State action question, in our view the

principle from an insurance company's actions in any other

may well be the triggering of a State adjudicatory

And the conduct of that adjudicatory mechanism

is that a slightly different legal standard applies:

Mr. McConnell pointed out, if the insurance company denies

And I think more generally we could analogize

7
8

the insurance company to the defendant in any private

civil action.

Again, the

private parties.

So, we think that the UR itself would be

MR. STEWART:

Well, certainly if -- if -- to

utilization review organization was composed of people who

I think what's -- what's crucial in this case

with respect to the due process issue is that, at least as

the case comes to this Court, there is no dispute as to

19

the adequacy of the procedures by which the UR and the

20

workers' compensation judge will make the ultimate

21

determination as to whether expenses are reasonable and

end.

Their only complaint is with the withholding of

2

payment by the insurer, pending the UR's determination of

3

the dispute.
And in our view, as -- as Mr. McConnell said,

4
5

that's a practice that is consistent with the way that

6

ordinary dispute resolution typically works.

7

when a person has a claim against him for money, the usual

8

rule is that the person can withhold payment pending

9

resolution of the dispute.

That is,

And in a sense, the -- the workers' compensation

10
11

scheme here is more favorable to the employee and the

12

doctor than the typical rule would be because if the -- if

13

the doctor prevails before the UR, if the UR makes the

14

determination that the care is reasonable or necessary,

15

the insurance company is required to pay at that time,

16

even if the insurance company intends to seek further

17

review before the workers' compensation judge.

18

19

final resolution of the dispute.

said the insurance company doesn't have to make payment

established all the prerequisites to entitlement to a

3

stream of benefits and where State officials attempt to

4

cut off those benefits on the ground that circumstances

5

have changed such that the individual has become

disentitled, and in that context, the Court has said that

procedural due process protections apply, that there is a

deprivation of property.

9

But here, the initial determination that the

worker is eligible for workers' compensation, that he was

imply any determination as to the reasonableness or

the -- the UR -- when the insurer invokes the UR to

MS. McKINLEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Workers' compensation in Pennsylvania is a noÂ­
fault system which was substituted for the claimant's
right to sue their employer for -- in tort for work-

related injuries.
It is an exclusive system.

Not only is the

worker precluded from suing the employer for negligence or

any other common law action that he might have had prior

I have no idea, Your Honor,

1

because this case was dismissed on a 12(b)(6) and there is

After the decision goes to the utilization

9
10

review organization, they have 60 days because they have

11

30 days to acquire the records, 30 days to make a

8

to me you say that once a State passes a statute enacting

a certain welfare scheme, everyone has a vested interest

10

in that welfare scheme, and any change from it -- I mean,

11

it's your characterization that it's a welfare scheme.

12

I'm not sure I agree with it, but assuming it is, any

13

change from that original welfare scheme is the

14

elimination of a vested right and is therefore invalid.

15

MS. McKINLEY:

Not necessarily.

Not

16

necessarily.

It depends upon the nature of the property

17

interest that the State has conferred to begin with.

18

in this situation, what we had was a State conferring a

property interest that could not be divested without the

State itself making a determination that the treatment was

not reasonable and necessary.
