ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER E. DELLINGER

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. DELLINGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When the North Carolina General Assembly enacted

10
11

its 1997 congressional districting plan, compliance with

12

this Court's decision in Shaw v. Hunt was its number one

13

goal.

15

either for its own sake or as a proxy, but they were made

16

on the basis of actual election data.

17

to accomplish the constitutionally legitimate goal of

18

maintaining partisan balance in the State's congressional

19

delegation.

20

Democratic Senate who determined not to gridlock and leave

21

this vital function to Federal courts.

22

on a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that retained six

23

districts leaning to each party, a goal that was

24

accomplished by having a Democratic-leaning district

25

created in the midst of the Republican sea that is the

It met that goal.

Let me put on the table a half dozen ways this

plan differs from those that this Court invalidated in

4

Miller and Shaw and Bush v. Vera.

6

districts.

detailed racial data.

units that are about a hundred times larger than the --

12

than the racially encoded census blocks used in Texas,

this plan -- they were not adopted for the express purpose

15

of creating a majority-minority district.

QUESTION:

Was there any allegation that the --

18

the precinct numbers were used as a surrogate for race;

19

that is to say, precinct numbers were used in order to

20

include people of a certain race in the district?

21

there any allegation of that here?

22

MR. DELLINGER:

Was

I take it, Justice Kennedy, that

23

is the -- the heart of the case, that there is this --

24

this overlap, and so given the fact that this -- that the

25

precincts included in district 12 are more Democratic and

that there is a correlation

3

present time — that one could have done that as a

pretext.

5

concur that there's simply no evidence that that was the

6

case.

7

it's more African-Americans

But I believe and I think that Mr. Everett would

I mean, I think what you have here is the

8

precise question that the Court answered in Bush v. Vera.

9

In the plurality opinion by Justice O'Connor, the Court

10

said that if a State's goal is the otherwise

11

constitutional political gerrymandering, it is free to use

12

precinct general elections, voting patterns, precinct

13

primary voting patterns to achieve that goal regardless of

14

its awareness of its racial implication and that if

15

district lines merely correlate with race, because they're

16

drawn on the basis of political affiliation which

17

correlates with race, there is no racial classification to

18

justify.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Dellinger, you say that there's

20

no evidence, but I -- some of the districts that -- that

21

were carved up in order to create this unusually shaped

22

district or some of the -- some of the counties were

23

indeed overwhelmingly Democratic, and it would have been

24

easy to put in more Democrats without putting in more

25

black Democrats.

And -- and part of the allegation is

1

that the -- what was done shows that there was an

2

intentional effort not only to get in Democrats, but to

3

get in black Democrats.

4

And that -- and that circumstantial evidence is

5

--is affirmed by the -- the affidavits put in by your

6

side which say that one of the purposes of the legislature

7

was to -- was to retain the election of incumbents.

8

here you had an incumbent who had been elected by a

9

district that had been unconstitutionally established on a

10

racial basis, and to simply come in and say, well, we want

11

to make sure that he'll get reelected is, it seems to me,

12

more circumstantial evidence.

13

MR. DELLINGER:

14

QUESTION:

I mean --

Well, you make --

-- there may not be enough evidence,

15

but it seems to me to go too far to say that

16

evidence that

17

here.

18

And

there's no

-- that there was any racialgerrymander

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, to be precise, Justice

19

Kennedy's question was whether there was any evidence that

20

they -- that they made a pretextual use of creating a

21

Democratic district, of using Democratic precincts in

22

order to create a district that was more African-American.

23

And one could

imagine counter-examples.

24

First of all, the State has direct evidence of

The examples that are given that there are

in terms of the incumbency, I don't think you can have a

bill of attainder that -- that Congressmen want, the

this Court held about the original plan.

This is not -- the chain of causation from the

for a second?

MR. DELLINGER:

QUESTION:

Sure.

Let's assume, for the sake of

chain of causation is broken or not.

argument.

I mean, you're arguing

Am I right?

I

Well, we're making two points.

One, we believe that it is obvious that the court below

erred in granting --

QUESTION:

Okay, but --

10

MR. DELLINGER:

11

QUESTION:

-- in granting summary judgment.

-- the only thing we've got from --

12

in -- in front of us is -- is an appeal from a grant of

13

summary judgment.

14

MR. DELLINGER:

Well, we would hope that the

15

Court, having before it the permanent injunction against

16

the legislature's '97 plan, would clearly indicate that

17

the State on facts like these was entitled to prevail,

18

it's entitled to summary judgment, because what the State

19

puts on is both direct and supporting evidence

20

demonstrating that the shape of the district reflected

Well, that -- that's true, but --

Did you-cross

No.

Well, we -- we -I understand that --

-- can't give you a judgment here

that is -- that goes beyond what -- what you've asked for.
MR. DELLINGER:

In the course -- it would not be

10

beyond the course of an opinion of the Court holding that

11

the district court was, of course, wrong in granting

12

summary judgment against the direct evidence of the --of

13

the State that politics was used, to make it clear to the

14

district court that the State's explanation, both direct

15

and supported, that it created a Democratic leading

16

district in a sea of Republicans, and that that is a fully

17

explanatory answer and which was contradicted --

QUESTION:

Well, it may be a fully explanatory

19

answer if we assume there is nothing else in the world

20

that might come in as an evidentiary matter here.

MR. DELLINGER:

were said to impeach the State's direct case.
One was the shape of the district, to which I

will come.
The other is that the -- that there are some

5

Democrats outside the district in precincts that are less

6

Democratic that -- that are not included.

7

And the third is basically a racial imbalance

8

argument, that if you look at the districts, the heavily

9

Republican -- southeastern Mecklenburg and otherwise

10

heavily Republican district of Representative Sue Myrick

11

as more proportionate whites than the heavily Democratic

12

leading district of -- of -- of Congressman Watt, that is

13

evidence only that it does not in any way contradict the

14

State's assertion that it was the desire to -- and the

15

difficulty of creating a political district.

What you have here is the complete absence of
counter-examples.
QUESTION:

Yes, but it sounds to me very much

19

like a cross-appeal.

20

say that they have not put in sufficient evidence, given

21

this total record, upon which one could say there was no

you're arguing is -- is something that strikes me like --

MR. DELLINGER:

I understand

Or the State didn't take.
-- that the -- the -- what the

4

State is -- wishes to establish is that the preliminary-

in junction -- the permanent injunction was in error.

6

clearly did not make their case for summary judgment.

7

But moreover --

8

QUESTION:

9

They

Well, if the summary judgment case

wasn't right, you could have the injunction vacated, and

10

then it goes back presumably for further development.

11

on that score, I wanted to ask, having had a preview of

12

what's going on in the summary judgment submissions, what

13

would the State -- what additional, if anything, would the

14

State put in were this case to go to trial?

15

MR. DELLINGER:

And

I do not believe that the State

16

-- I am not aware --we haven't thought through to that

17

point, Justice Ginsburg.

18

has or indeed would need any other information.

19

the challengers have appropriately a very heavy burden

And now, it

it has to be evidence

showing that there is a controverted issue of fact.

3

Suppose the evidence showing the controversion is so weak

in light of the evidence on the other side, that no

Can you bring in a 10-times felon who has perjured himself

in so many cases testifying to a fact that is inherently

controverting that fact, is that enough to get you by

motive in drawing district 12 was race.

What does a predominant motive mean?

I'm -- I'm a little unclear about that.

MR. FELDMAN:

QUESTION:

I think the --

MR. FELDMAN:

Does that

I think that that -- I think the

14

-- the fact that there were substantial parts of the

15

district that may have been put there for racial reasons

16

would be evidentiarily very significant, but I don't think

17

the fact that there were a few isolated pockets would be

18

sufficient to establish a predominant motive.

In Shaw against Hunt, the Court explained a

predominant motive as being that that couldn't be

We certainly wouldn't say,

But it didn't say as to the whole

of the district that -- that may have had race as a factor

QUESTION:

Well, what would be the rationale

which would allow you to use -- to use race only as the

sole factor in -- in comprising part of a district?

8

-- what conceivable rationale would allow that under the

9

Equal Protection Clause?

10

MR. FELDMAN:

What

Well, I -- I think the rationale

11

would be that the Court has -- when it's discussed the

12

issue, has talked -- has mentioned the fact that race --

13

legislators commonly are aware of race when they draw a

14

district, as they are aware of many of the other

demographic factors of the district they're drawing.

the Court has --

talking about specific purpose.

19

MR. FELDMAN:

And

I'm

Right, but I think given that

20

awareness, the Court has also said, or at least the

21

plurality said, in Bush that the mere desire to draw even

22

If -- if you have some legislators who

that has been, for many years, represented by a white
Congressman, and they're worried that too many blacks in
that district might make it difficult for him to get
reelected because his policies have generally not been
favored by blacks, it can take those blacks and chop them
out of his district and put them into this new
gerrymandered district so long as that's not a big part of

under this Court's decision in Shaw, that they drew the

6

MR. FELDMAN:

That's correct, and I -- I think

that was where the district court went wrong, because it

was completely consistent with the State's evidence to

left out, to say what the legislature claimed it did was

11

not trying to draw districts that had a lot of registered

12

Democrats, it was trying to draw a district that had

13

precincts that include those who would reliably vote

14

Democratic on election day.

15

And I think the experts' evidence and the maps

16

and, indeed, even the maps that the plaintiffs put in make

17

quite clear that at least that explanation is very

18

consistent with all of the facts.

Mr. Feldman, don't you think it's

giving the sort of evidentiary consideration to your map,

MR. EVERETT:

Well, Your Honor, there a couple

of things that seem very important in that context.

is to recall that, according to undisputed evidence,

Mr. Everett, can -- can one say that

You know, if you're -- if you're sitting as a finder of

characterize it that way.

MR. EVERETT:

Well, Your Honor, we -- we would

-- we point out in our brief that there are some decisions

of this Court which would certainly suggest that post hoc

10

affidavits by legislators are not competent to show what

11

the intent was at the time.

12

We think in this instance they actually confirm

13

that which we have suggested, as for example, there's a

14

portion of Senator Cooper's affidavit which makes it clear

15

they were concerned about -- and this is specifically in

there -- concerned about whether the removal of some of

the African-American voters, particularly those in Durham

The posture of that litigation is

that it's in a holding pattern awaiting the disposition of

14

Interestingly enough, if in this case the

instead, as exhibited by their own -- the submission under

They were concerned that because of the removal

districts which are not predicated primarily on race,

And we would suggest, Your Honors, that if you
