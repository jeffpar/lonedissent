CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Ms. McDowell.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA B. McDOWELL

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MS. McDOWELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has

11

the authority to award compensatory damages in the

12

administrative process to redress violations of title VII

13

by agencies of the Federal Government.

14

conferred by two provisions of title 42 read together.

15

The first is section 2000e-16, which authorizes the EEOC

16

to award appropriate remedies in the administrative

17

process against Federal agencies that violate title VII.

18

The second is section 1981a, which authorizes awards of

19

compensatory damages in title VII actions against the

20

Federal Government.

21

QUESTION:

22

23

That authority is

But it doesn't specifically say by

the EEOC in that section, does it?
MS. McDOWELL:

No, it doesn't, Mr. Chief

24

Justice, but we believe that the two sections, read

25

together, provide the EEOC with that authority.

Essentially, by waiving the Government's sovereign

2

immunity with respect to compensatory damages, that made

compensatory damages also an appropriate that may be

4

awarded in the administrative process by --

7

QUESTION:

So many administrative agencies award

compensatory damages?
MS. McDOWELL:

Yes, they do.

Agencies

8

themselves award it, and the EEOC on appeal also awards

9

them in the administrative process.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

In those instances is there judicial

review from the amount -- from the agency award?
MS. McDOWELL:

If an employee or applicant for

13

employment is dissatisfied with the award that's made at

14

the administrative level, he can bring an action de novo

15

in district court.

16

QUESTION:

What about the Government?

17

MS. McDOWELL:

18

QUESTION:

The agency does not, though.

So in the other statutory instances

19

that you mentioned in your answer to the Chief Justice,

20

I'm curious to know, are there any instances in which the

21

Government is bound and cannot have judicial review of the

22

amount of compensatory damages awarded by an agency?

23

MS. McDOWELL:

There are other statutory schemes

24

that are somewhat similar.

For example, the Federal

25

Employees Compensation Act, which compensates employees

1

who are injured and killed on the job, doesn't have a

2

judicial review mechanism.
QUESTION:

3

So the Solicitor General is arguing

4

here for the proposition that the Government is subject to

5

unreviewable damage awards on the part of the EEOC.
MS. McDOWELL:

6

Essentially, yes, Your Honor,

7

that Congress made that determination in 1972 when it

8

provided that only employees and applicants for employment

9

can challenge EEOC awards.
QUESTION:

10
11

But at that time there were no

compensatory damages available.
MS. McDOWELL:

12

That's correct, Your Honor, but

13

there were back pay awards and other sorts of awards,

14

including reinstatement, promotion and so on, that in many

15

senses are more intrusive to agencies than compensatory

16

damages.

17

Presently, of course, back pay and compensatory

18

damages are both available in the administrative process

19

and the back pay awards exceed the compensatory damages

20

award by a factor of at least three.

21
22

QUESTION:

The Government would have the usual

appeal if the damages were awarded in the district court.

23

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct, Your Honor.

24

The court of appeals construed section 1981a as

25

limiting the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity to

proceedings in court in which a jury trial would be

available.

3

reasons.

That position is incorrect for at least three

First, the court of appeals' position is

4
5

inconsistent with the administrative exhaustion

6

requirement of section 2000e-16 (c), which is a condition

7

on the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity under

8

title VII.
QUESTION:

9

May I just clarify one other thing

10

about the damages.

Supposing that the employee is

11

dissatis -- gets damages from the EEOC but he's

12

dissatisfied with the amount.

13

employee can go -- still file an action seeking greater

14

damages?

15

MS. McDOWELL:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. McDOWELL:

18

QUESTION:

Is it your view that the

Yes, Your Honor --

Okay.
-- he may.

And one further clarification.

Is

19

the EEOC a necessary stop for the employee, or can the

20

employee go upon the agency to court?

21

no, no discrimination, or discrimination but no back pay,

22

can the employee skip over the EEOC?

23

MS. McDOWELL:

If the agency says

Yes, Your Honor.

The EEOC is an

24

optional choice, although it certainly is a choice that is

25

made by most employees in the process.

For example, in

1

fiscal 1997 approximately 1,000 cases were filed by

2

employees in court.

3

4

desirable route for a large number of employees.

5

Approximately 7,00 appeals to the

That suggests that the EEOC is a

QUESTION:

It might have made sense for Congress

6

to say, if you want damages you go immediately to court,

7

and if you don't want damages, you can go to the EEOC.

8

9

MS. McDOWELL:

It might have made sense, but

Congress did not say that.

Congress didn't disturb the

10

administrative exhaustion requirement, which had always

11

been understood to enable an employee or applicant to

12

obtain full relief in the administrative process.

13

QUESTION:

But you say -- it's not exhaustion

14

once it's an option that the employee can go there or not,

15

and the second leg of your argument that I'm having

16

difficulty with, I don't understand the extent of your

17

exhaustion, waiver, or whatever.

18

Suppose the employee never asks the agency, it just

19

said to the agency, you discriminated me -- against me on

20

the basis of sex, and the agency said, and he doesn't

21

specify damages.

22

forfeit compensatory damages by not asking for it before

23

the agency, or does the forfeiture come only from not

24

asking for it before the EEOC?

25

It was a he in this case.

MS. McDOWELL:

Does he

1

situation that he would forfeit that by not asking for

2

them at the agency level as well.
QUESTION:

3
4

Is it true that most of these people

at the agency level are not represented by counsel?

5

MS. McDOWELL:

I believe that's correct, Your

6

Honor, at least a large number of them are not.

7

not to suggest, however, that most of them aren't asking

8

for compensatory damages.

9

QUESTION:

That's

Indeed, they are.

Well, a lay person, really, terms

10

like compensatory damages, they're not familiar with those

11

words.

12

of counsel, instructions, advice that says, when you file

13

a complaint with us, this is what you can complain about,

14

these are the possible remedies, so then we could say,

15

well, the employee saw that, it's an intelligent action?

16

Does the agency or the EEOC have some kind of set

MS. McDOWELL:

There's no requirement that an

17

employee be specifically advised of what sort of remedies

18

he can receive.

19

However, the EEOC does have procedures that

20

agencies are required to follow, that if an employee says

21

anything to indicate that he has suffered compensatory

22

damages, if he mentions emotional distress, for example,

23

if he mentions that he's seen a doctor, the agency is

24

supposed to make further inquiry to see whether a

25

compensatory damages claim is indeed appropriate in that

1

case.

The agency and the EEOC are not allowed to rely on

2

an employee's failure to use particular magic words to

3

request compensatory damages.

4

QUESTION:

Well, how does the agency know, then,

5

what amount of compensatory damages are being sought when

6

it's defending these charges in the EEOC?

7

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, presumably the employee, if

8

he has made a claim for compensatory damages, bears the

9

burden of proof, and the EEOC has held this, of

10

establishing both the amount and the nexus to the alleged

11

discrimination.

12

QUESTION:

Does the employee file some sort of a

13

paper that says, you know, I want $50,000 in compensatory

14

damages before the -- in the EEOC proceeding?

15

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, the second step, actually

16

the administrative process is the filing of a formal

17

complaint at the agency level and that typically, as in

18

this case, asks the employee what relief are you asking

19

for, and in this case Mr. Gibson requested back pay.

20

didn't request compensatory damages.

21

22

23

QUESTION:

He

And so -- but under your view he

didn't waive compensatory damages by not asking for them?
MS. McDOWELL:

That's -- the view that the EEOC

24

has taken is that he doesn't necessarily have to request

25

them in his complaint or in particular words -9

1

QUESTION:

2

MS. McDOWELL:

3

Well then, how --- but he does have to identify

the need for compensatory damages at some point.
QUESTION:

4

How does the agency know how to

5

defend against a complaint like that if it doesn't even

6

request compensatory damages?
MS. McDOWELL:

7

Well, typically that is why it's

8

our position that the employee does need to waive the

9

compensatory damages claim if the -QUESTION:

10
11

I thought you said just a minute ago

he didn't have to.
MS. McDOWELL:

12

No, certainly he does.

He

13

doesn't have to say compensatory damages in so many words,

14

or he doesn't necessarily have to say compensatory damages

15

in his complaint, but at some point in the administrative

16

process he certainly does have to put the agency on

17

notice.

18

QUESTION:

Well, but could it be at the very --

19

I mean, if he doesn't have to do it in his complaint,

20

which is where most claims for compensatory damages are

21

made, could be doe it at the very end?

22

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, then there would have to be

23

an investigation to determine the amount of his claim and

24

whether it is connected with the alleged discrimination,

25

so at some point there would be a fact-finding process.

1

In many of these cases there's actually an administrative

2

hearing before an EEOC administrative judge at the agency

3

level, and at that point, at times the evidence that's

4

taken on compensatory damages claims can be quite

5

extensive, including reports from competing psychiatrists,

6

and so on.

7

QUESTION:

Doesn't it put the agency in a rather

8

peculiar position?

It's defending against a claim, and at

9

the same time you're telling us that it will advise the

10

plaintiff exactly what claim he has.

11

sees that -- if the agency sees that there's a basis for a

12

compensatory claim, the agency will tell them to make a

13

compensatory claim?

14

MS. McDOWELL:

You see that if he

The EEOC has held that it's

15

appropriate when an employee indicates that he suffered

16

that kind of damage to make further inquiry to see if what

17

he is really seeking are compensatory damages

18

QUESTION:

I thought you said -- I thought you

19

were referring about the agency by which he is was

20

employed.

He initially goes to that agency, doesn't he?

21

MS. McDOWELL:

22

QUESTION:

23

MS. McDOWELL:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct, yes.

Now -And there's a --

And you say he has to make the

compensatory claim before that agency, as well.

1

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes, although the EEOC has said

2

that in some instances he may defer raising the claim if

3

he's not aware of it until he gets to the EEOC level, the

4

second level.

5

the EEOC, the typical procedure is for it to be remanded.

6

7

In that case, if he raises it first before

QUESTION:

But he ordinarily has to raise it

before the employing agency, right?

8

MS. McDOWELL:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

And you're saying that the employing

10

agency is going, what, out of the goodness of its heart,

11

to advise him that he has a compensatory claim which it

12

should pay?

13

position. It's both defending against the claim, and

14

supposedly advising the plaintiff as to what claim he

15

should make.

It puts the employing agency in a strange

MS. McDOWELL:

17

QUESTION:

18

MS. McDOWELL:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, he does, it does, and --

Well, Ms. McDowell, this --- the EEOC has felt that --

-- the requirements, this is a

20

peculiar kind of thing, but the -- isn't the agency

21

required to have an EEO officer who, when people complain

22

about discrimination, is there to aid the person, so you

23

have the agency both as being assistant to the

24

complainant, and the agency is the adversary, but am I

25

wrong in thinking that the agency is obliged to have an

1

EEO counselor?
MS. McDOWELL:

2

Yes, and that's the very initial

3

phase of the whole EEO process,

4

and this is an effort to try to resolve these complaints

5

before a formal complaint is filed.
QUESTION:

6
7

By the agency that would be the

adversary?

8

MS. McDOWELL:

9

QUESTION:

10
11
12

is informal counseling,

Yes.

The informal counseling.

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes, that is a counselor of that

agency, yes.
QUESTION:

And that's kind of a conflict of

13

interest, where the agency is counseling the employee, and

14

presumably that's to tell the employee what his rights

15

are, and then the agency ends up being the target of

16

whatever complaint the employee files, but the agency does

17

have that obligation, to be a counselor to the employee.

18

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct, and as a

19

practical matter there are different people performing

20

these different functions within the agency.

21

counselors are supposed to be independent of those who are

22

making the determination on the merits of a claim when it

23

comes to that.

We don't perceive that we were

making precisely that argument, Your Honor.

It's our

10

position that there does need to be a clear waiver of

sovereign immunity, and that was made here in section

13

this broad language in the statute enabled the EEOC to

What would happen if the employee

QUESTION:

Even though we are envisioning an

uncounseled employee, and an officer in the agency who has

the obligation to advise this uncounseled person about his

MS. McDOWELL:

failure to exhaust administrative remedies by not

2

requesting compensatory damages from the agency would

require the dismissal of his claim.

4

necessarily mean that his claim would have to be dismissed

5

with prejudice, however.

6

7

extent that the issue must be raised before the agency,

but the time limits for exhaustion are not, so in cases

he failed to exhaust before.

QUESTION:

It seems to me that if the EEOC is

monitoring their system, it's very odd that there aren't

instructions, as there are in many cases.

give a party appeal instructions, if you don't like what

we do you can go here, and not to tell an uncounseled

employee who just says, I want money, what the options

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, as we say, it wouldn't

entirely preclude an employee who could establish once he

13

went to court that he had a good reason for not having

14

raised the claim before.

15

It's our understanding that most employees are

quite well-informed of their ability to obtain

compensatory damages.

cases that are appealed to the EEOC in which compensatory

damages are theoretically available because they're under

Most are.

There were

approximately 26,000 cases resolved at the agency level in

MS. McDOWELL:

No.

There's nothing about the

MS. McDOWELL:

No, it doesn't.

And it would be a very strange

13

scheme, it seems to me, if you don't have to ask for

if you allow it at the EEOC it doesn't make any sense not

MS. McDOWELL:

Well, there's one other point,

Justice Scalia, and that is that everybody agrees that an

The general rule there is that an agency can

QUESTION:

Could you focus for just a second,

20

please, on the jury trial argument?

21

against you as being that 1981 says that in an action

22

brought under 717, and this is an action brought under

would have thought they could.

1

seeks compensatory damages any party may demand a trial by

2

jury, and since it's obvious the EEOC is not a place where

3

you'd have a trial by jury, it's obvious that this doesn't

4

apply to the EEOC, the waiver that's in 1981.

5
6

That's the argument, and I'd like you to respond
to that argument.

7

MS. McDOWELL:

We think that the most

8

appropriate construction of the jury trial provision as

9

applied to Federal employee cases is that if, indeed, a

10

case reaches district court because the employee was not

11

satisfied with either the administrative agency's award or

12

the EEOC's award, then either party can, indeed, request a

13

jury trial, but this doesn't foreclose the EEOC from doing

14

it.

15

QUESTION:

Now, has that ever been determined?

16

I ask that because the argument continues, the Government

17

isn't going to be able to ask for a jury trial.

going to be bound by the EEOC.

2

Has it ever been interpreted

authoritatively?

3

MS. McDOWELL:

4

QUESTION:

No, not that I'm aware of.

But the Government's position is that

5

means that if you don't get compensatories before the

6

agency, you have a right under that provision to have the

7

issue done anew in the trial court.

8

MS. McDOWELL:

That's correct, yes.

9

It's important to recognize that the jury trial

10

provision is a general provision.

11

specifically at the Federal Government.

12

provision that applies to all title VII cases whether

13

against the Government or against private employees.

14

provision is already in the legislation that became

15

section 1981a before Senator Warner offered his amendment

16

to extend compensatory damages to Federal employees as

didn't.
QUESTION:

2

No, but the amendment in 1981a, the

3

jury trial point, it emphasized it focuses on actions for

damages.

the EEOC under 2000e-16.

You think of a judicial proceeding, and that

7

MS. MCDOWELL:

8

QUESTION:

9

MS. McDOWELL:

Yes.

Yes.
It's also important to recognize

10

that all of this legislation was enacted against a

11

historical background of Congress' historical aversion to

12

jury trials on monetary claims against the Government.

13

Certainly that's reflected in the Tucker Act and the

14

Federal Tort Claims Act, where a condition of the

15

Government's waiver --

16

Yes, but the Government -- there is a

right to a jury trial on both sides once you get to court,

Congress made back in 1972, Your Honor.
QUESTION:

5

You say that Congress made this

traditional sovereign immunity principles suggest that the

8

Government doesn't like jury trials.

9

certainly would rather have a jury trial than no trial at

The Government

all, I would think.
MS. McDOWELL:

11

Well, Congress decided otherwise

12

when it determined that finality was more important than

13

whatever extra accuracy would be obtained by judicial

14

proceedings with respect to equitable relief, back pay and

15

so on, under title VII.

16

QUESTION:

That's --

Of course, when the Government has no

trial at all, it's the Government's own fault, right,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY M. KELLY

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. KELLY:

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I'd like to address initially Justice Ginsburg's

9
10

concerns about the issue as to how an employee goes about

11

requesting compensatory damages. I think if you take a

12

look at the appendix, the joint appendix in this case, at

13

the two fold-out pages in the center, I believe pages 23

14

and 24, you'll see the actual EEO form that Mike Gibson

15

filled out back in 1992 when this case initially arose,

16

and you'll see in that form that there's really no place

17

for an employee to indicate that he wants compensatory

18

damages.
The only question that's asked on this form

19
20

relating to any kind of remedy at all, it asks not what

21

injury you suffered, but what corrective action are you

22

seeking.

23

corrective action is in direct lineage with the

24

interpretation of the Federal employee section of title

25

VII, which has always held that only equitable remedies

It's our position that this request for

were available for either Federal employees or private

2

employees of discrimination until the 1991 act was passed.

3

QUESTION:

And I suppose it goes to the

4

obligation to raise the issue at the agency level.

5

mean, if I were reading that form I would not get a hint

6

from the section referring to corrective action that it

7

might be appropriate for me to ask for damages.
MR. KELLY:

8

I

And that's exactly our position

both in the district court and in the Seventh Circuit with

10

respect to Mike Gibson's exhausting his administrative

11

remedies and the argument that the Government ought to be

12

estopped from raising the bar of exhaustion in this

MR. KELLY:

You did not, Your Honor, but the

24

opinions of this Court indicate that it's the judgment

25

that's reviewed not the reasoning of the court of appeals,

1

and all of the arguments that we've presented are strong

2

reasons to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals if

3

not according to the same reasoning, and we do agree with

4

the reasoning of the Seventh Circuit.

5

I point this out because not only did the form

6

draw Mike Gibson in a different direction, the

7

regulations, the EEOC regulations specifically require the

8

agency and the EEOC to advise Mike Gibson of his rights

9

and to oversee this instruction of pro se litigants

10

through the administrative system, and that was never

11

done.

12

QUESTION:

Well, that -- I repeat, that's really

13

not the issue that we're interested in.

14

assume for purposes of your argument that this form were

15

required to be corrected, as the Government would

16

doubtless say it ought to be, to say what -- not what

17

corrective action are you seeking, but what remedies of

18

any sort, including compensatory damages, are you seeking.

19

Then what would your argument be?

20

MR. KELLY:

Why don't you

Well, in that event, Your Honor, we

21

have argued also that Mike Gibson invoked the compensatory

22

damage remedy by telling the investigator from the

23

Veterans Administration that he was seeking a monetary

24

cash award.

25

The EEOC has ruled that a request for an

1

appropriate cash reward is a request for compensatory

2

damages, and for the agency to take the position that

3

monetary cash award is a request for compensatory damages,

4

and appropriate cash reward is not a request, or vice

5

versa, we think is a return to the hypertechnical

6

exhaustion requirement that predates giving Federal

7

employees access to the Federal courts in 1972.
With regard to the sovereign immunity issue, we

have argued not only the jury trial provision of section

1981a, and I believe that the -- Ms. McDowell misreads

not begin with, if a case gets to Federal district court,

the possibility of a bigger box than what you would get

MR. KELLY:

that can be done by offering compensatory damages, by

Isn't that the answer?

They can

always anticipate that at some point the claimant will end

The trouble is, I don't know of any

5

and what you're allowed to ask the agency for is

you're asking for $100,000 and the agency says, well,

There are some published statistics.

Unfortunately, the EEOC doesn't keep its statistics

according to the number of compensatory damages cases

where awards were made, and so it's impossible to say how

MR. KELLY:

Well, beginning in 1992 with the

Jackson decision, which by the way is not published, and

was not published in West Law or any of the private

to award compensatory damages, or at least consider awards

19

of compensatory damages in certain cases, and the EEOC

It seems

6

that if you are insisting that the employee ask for this

before the agency, ask for it before the EEOC, instead of

8

taking it out of a general demand for relief, then you're

asking for an exactness in the administrative proceeding

you the relief to which you're entitled even if you

haven't asked specifically for it.
MS. McDOWELL:

13

Yes.

The 54(c) talks about

14

relief that you have actually proven, and that's

15

consistent with the EEOC's position here, that if you have

16

proven compensatory damages in the administrative process,

yes, you can recover them, but an agency and the EEOC

shouldn't be forced to guess at what damages you may have
