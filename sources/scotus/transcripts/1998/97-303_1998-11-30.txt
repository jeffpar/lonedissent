ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. COLBERT, III

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. COLBERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The issue presented before the Court here

14

reduces itself down to two questions.

15

most fundamental question is the meaning that Congress

16

intended to the phrase invalidate, impair, or supersede as

17

used in the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

18

The first and the

Did Congress intend to afford to those words,

19

and particularly to the word impair, its common parlance

20

plain meaning, or did Congress intend a special,

21

restricted meaning, as respondents and the Government have

22

argued and as the Court below has found?

23

I suggest to the Court that that critical

24

question makes the second question easy.

25

question is, under a proper reading of the word impair,

The second

1

and I focus on that because I think it is the critical

2

word, under a proper reading of the word impair, as

3

intended by Congress, is a State regulatory scheme

4

impaired by an alternative Federal remedy that renders

5

academic the State legislature's decision as to the

6

appropriate remedy to be afforded for the violation of

7

some standard?

8

9
10

Those are the two questions that I believe are
dispositive of the matter before the Court.
With respect to the first question, the Court

11

below did not attempt a parsing of the language.

12

not see anything in the decision of the Ninth Circuit or

13

of the other circuits that adopt the same view as the

14

Ninth Circuit, no attempt to go to the words of the

15

statute and ask, what does the word impair mean?

16

it mean to the 79th Congress when the McCarran-Ferguson

17

Act was adopted?

18

We do

What did

In the courts of appeal, what we had is an

19

interpretation by analogy.

The McCarran-Ferguson Act has

20

about it an aspect of preemption in that it has an

21

analogous effect and therefore the Ninth Circuit and the

22

other circuits that go along with the Ninth Circuit have

23

reasoned, we believe incorrectly for the reasons set forth

24

in our briefs, that preemption and the special rules of

25

preemption apply.

QUESTION:

1

Well, how do you say we should look

2

at the level of conflict between Federal and State law to

3

determine impairment?

4

that the Federal RICO law gives a remedy that is not

5

precluded by State law, and that may be supplemental but

6

doesn't impair the State scheme.

7

MR. COLBERT:

I mean, one way to look at this is

Whether a remedy is supplemental

8

of a State scheme or impairment of a State scheme depends

9

upon the answer to the question of whether we take

10

seriously the decision of the State legislature to limit

11

remedies.

12

If Nevada in this instance, when it had adopted

13

the private cause of action under its State insurance law,

14

had said, we -- had put a preamble in that said, the

15

legislature has considered and rejected enhanced damages

16

because of a concern for impeding the solvencies of

17

insurers for the purpose of giving windfalls to the first

18

person to get into the courthouse door, if we had such a

19

preamble, there could be no question --

20

QUESTION:

But I thought the law didn't commute

21

punitive damages which have no lid and could be higher

22

than treble damages.

23

MR. COLBERT:

But the limit on punitive damages,

24

which is critical to this issue, is that punitive damages

25

are not allowed where they impair the solvency of the

1

defendant.

You may punish, but you may not destroy, and

2

the first goal of the insurance laws of the State of

3

Nevada and every other State in the Union is to protect

4

the solvency of the insurers.

5

RICO gives no discretion to the Court.

6

damages are mandatory, and if that impairs the solvency of

7

the insurer, so be it.

8

damages.
QUESTION:

9

Treble

The same is not true of punitive

Well, I can understand if Nevada had

10

passed some statutory provision in expressing its intent

11

that its State remedies be exclusive, that this would be

12

an impairment, but absent that, it isn't so clear to me

13

that allowing the Federal remedy is an impairment.

14

MR. COLBERT:

But why do we put the burden on

15

the State of Nevada to adopt the hypothetical preamble I

16

came up with a moment before?

17

to justify its legislative decision?

18

McCarran-Ferguson --

19

QUESTION:

Why is it Nevada's burden
The structure of the

Well, it doesn't have to, but when

20

it's enacting its own laws it can certainly make it clear.

21

In the meantime, how is it an impairment?
MR. COLBERT:

22

Well, what are we to have the

23

district courts do in applying Federal law in this

24

instance?

25

to examine the legislative history of every portion of the

Are we to now ask the Federal district courts

insurance law in Nevada or the several States, and ask the

2

question, did the Nevada State legislature mean it when it

3

adopted - -

4

QUESTION:

Well, the obvious thing would be much

5

simpler.

I mean, the obvious thing if you didn't know

6

anything about it, you'd say, well, this Court held that

7

insurance was interstate commerce.

8

And at that point Congress is worried that it might have a

9

whole lot of laws out there that affect interstate

10

commerce, and it doesn't want those laws to affect

11

insurance.

12

by surprise.

Surprise, surprise.

It doesn't want, in other words, to be taken

13

MR. COLBERT:

14

QUESTION:

Absolutely.

So Congress simply says, look all

15

these laws out there that we've passed, general laws

16

affecting interstate commerce, all right, they don't

17

preempt State insurance laws unless we specifically said

18

so by directing limited insurance, end of the matter,

19

period, and the only purpose that the word impair is doing

20

there is that sometimes you could in effect impair --

21

sorry.

22

wrecking it through your preemptive interpretation that

23

although it's still on the books it's severely impaired.

24
25

You could in effect preempt the State law by so

In other words, impair does almost nothing, not
completely nothing but almost nothing, and now, if that is

1

so, you have the purpose achieved of what you think was

2

ordinary.
What's the evidence that what I just said is not

3
4

the case?
MR. COLBERT:

5

Well, it is perfectly plain from

6

the debates and the enactment of the McCarran-Ferguson Act

7

that Congress was, as you've just suggested, Justice

8

Breyer, extremely concerned about inadvertent interference

9

with the State regulation of the business of insurance,

10

and it's for that reason that Congress placed upon itself

11

the burden of saying when congressional legislation would

12

apply, the reference in the McCarran-Ferguson Act to no

13

act of Congress except that specifically related to the

14

business of insurance.

15
16

And it is perfectly plain that Congress intended
more than just antipreemption, but remember --

17

QUESTION:

It couldn't have said when it would

18

apply.

19

laws, for example, don't specifically mention insurance,

20

but they apply.

21

to insurance, like everything else, so Congress couldn't

22

have meant just, we have to say specifically when Federal

23

law applies.

24
25

I don't mean to cut you off, but obviously the tax

I mean, thousands of Federal laws apply

MR. COLBERT:

When -- Federal law applies where

the Federal rule of decision results in a different answer

1

from the State rule of decision with respect to the

2

business of insurance, the relationship between an

3

insurance company and its insureds.

4

And the notion that it is somehow the burden of

5

the State of Nevada to say, when we adopted a private

6

remedy that allows only compensatory damages, we thought

7

about that, we thought about whether compensatory damages

8

would be sufficient, or whether we should have enhanced

9

damages, the notion that McCarran-Ferguson places on the

10

States the obligation to put such preambles in the law is

11

inconsistent with the observation you just made, Justice

12

Breyer, which was Congress didn't want Congress to

13

interfere by accident with the regulation of the States.

14

Congress could have provided that RICO applies

15

to the business of insurance.

16

it is not Nevada's burden under the act to anticipate that

17

Congress will adopt a statute and then have an ambiguity

18

down the road as to whether or not the Nevada decision

19

with respect to remedies will or will not be respected by

20

the Federal courts.

21

QUESTION:

It can do so tomorrow, but

Mr. Colbert, what is your authority

22

for saying that Nevada does not allow punitive damages

where they would threaten the solvency of the insurance

company?

MR. COLBERT:

That is correct.

It is an issue

QUESTION:

keep saying Nevada doesn't have to prove this or that.

It's slightly uncomfortable for you to be such a stalwart

champion of the State when we have the National

MR. COLBERT:

QUESTION:

14

McCarran-

That is correct.

And what law enacted by Nevada was

impaired by this?
MR. COLBERT:

It's Nevada Code section 686A,

15

16

specifically sections .310 of that particular chapter,

17

which enumerates various acts which are rendered unlawful

No, but the remedies provided in

those provisions may be enforced to the letter as far as

the Nevada legislature is authorized.

MR. COLBERT:

QUESTION:

Yes.

The -- in other words, the Nevada

6

laws can be fully enforced, notwithstanding the

7

enforcement of RICO, and that's -- for that reason it's

8

hard for me to see how those laws have been impaired.
MR. COLBERT:

9

Well, I return to the question,

10

suppose the preamble to the private remedy contained in

11

that same statute expressly recognized the possibility of

12

enhanced damage and stated the decision of the Nevada

13

legislature to provide only compensatory damages, not

14

enhanced damages.

15

me wrong.

QUESTION:

That preamble does not exist, don't get

No, but even if it did, and they'd

17

say for that reason we've decided there's going to be a

18

cap on all State law causes of action, you may still

19

enforce the State law cause of action 100 percent, and

20

therefore, how is it impaired?
MR. COLBERT:

21

Because you have made the decision

22

of the Nevada legislature to limit damages in that fashion

an idle act.

in the Nevada courts you can only get those damages.

still -- it defines the scope of the Nevada remedy, and

3

the Nevada remedy is precisely the same, whether or not

4

MR. COLBERT:

But keep in mind, Justice Stevens,

6

that the principal goal of insurance regulation in this

State and every other State is the protection of the

solvency of the carrier.

MR. COLBERT:

13

I

It's not just to

Oh, no, I don't mean to overstate

14

it, but it clearly is the principal aim of all State

15

insurance legislation, because that is how you protect

policyholders.
The policyholders of an insurance company are

most protected if the company is still in existence to pay

Giving a mandatory trebling of that amount with

5

no discretion in the trial court to reduce it is not

6

consistent with the notion that what you want to do is

7

have the insurance company here tomorrow to pay tomorrow's

claims.

9

Now, again, I cannot point the Court to a

10

preamble in the Nevada law that says, we, the legislature,

11

gave this thought when we were adopting the private right

12

of action that exists in Nevada law.

Well, the traditional analysis,

significantly impair the net worth of the company.
It's a -- it is the kind of analysis that's done

QUESTION:

If that's so,

that's what -- the kind

of thing that convinces me that impair can't mean impair,

On good legal advice we've learned that

the Federal Government law can't impair ours, and on that

11

assumption we pass a law that all insurance companies will

12

pay a 5 percent corporate tax, and we pick this number 5

13

because we know they won't have to pay any more Federal

14

tax once we pass this law, because we think for them to

15

pay the Federal business tax, you know, under ordinary

16

corporate tax law, we'll really impair what we're trying

17

to do here, which is to raise 5 percent.

They're all claiming the same pool of funds, the

ultimate availability of which is dependent upon the

continued solvency of the insurance carrier who's going to

different policyholders, we are not going to permit

We're only going to permit recovery.
I see a difference between that and the decision

10

on the part of the State that we're going to collect a

11

tax, and because we want to collect a tax, we're going to

12

urge that we have the ability under the McCarran-Ferguson

Act to restrict Congress' ability to tax the same entity.

14

You're not directing yourself at the same issue.

15

In the instance in which you have single damages

yourself the question, should I be taking money out of the

yourself if the laws of the State are materially different

what the consequence may be to the insurance company.

You

2

could have a situation in which, as a result of mandatory

3

treble damages, the insurance company defendant goes

4

straight into liquidation.

It is insolvent.

5

You could have the same award come out of a jury

6

and the trial judge doesn't have to let that happen, and I

7

suggest it would be an abuse of discretion to allow that

8

to happen, and that is a very real difference.

9

Now, I'm not pretending in this case that the

10

award below is going to put this petitioner into

11

liquidation, but if you're -- but if you want to ask

yourself the question of whether we have an important

clear that we do.

QUESTION:

So that RICO would be incompatible

with any State law that didn't provide for treble damages.
MR. COLBERT:

Any State insurance law that

said the treble damage provision in this case - - because

My name is G. Robert Blakey and I represent Mary

about the insolvency question that came up previously.

Before I begin my

First, the case that my colleague was referring

15

to is Nevada Cement, 514 Pacific the 2nd, 1180.

17

is to vindicate the public interest without annihilating

the defendant.

The case

I don't see how he has standing

20

to complain about the possibility of an insolvency.

He

21

has conceded he's not insolvent.

22

construing the word impair, it would be impaired as

applied, so if we got it in a company where triple damages

would, in fact, make it insolvent, in that situation you

would have an impairment under his test, but not

2

This was not part of the briefing, and so I didn't get it.

3

My mind has the fact that there's an Oklahoma district

4

court opinion that says you cannot collect triple damages

5

under RICO in a bankruptcy, and if that's good law, it

6

seems to me is what would happen in this case, if the

7

actual damage judgment sent them into bankruptcy, we

8

couldn't collect RICO triple damages against them in

9

bankruptcy anyway.
QUESTION:

10

Well, do insurance companies go into

11

ordinary bankruptcy if there's an insolvency proceeding

12

under State law?

13

MR. BLAKEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, that is in fact

14

my next point.

15

so if a judgment put it into bankruptcy, the stock -- the

16

stockholders might lose, but the policyholders would be

17

paid by the insolvency fund, so in fact we've taken into

18

consideration in Nevada law the danger of insolvency.

19

Most every State has an insolvency fund,

QUESTION:

Well, his point would be you would

20

need a bigger insolvency fund, which means you would need

21

higher premiums, and his point would be that the

22

legislature has carefully calculated what a good level of

23

premiums is, and it doesn't include the level necessary to

24

pump up the insolvency fund enough to cover treble

25

damages.

MR. BLAKEY:

I hesitate to opine on insurance

2

law generally, but my understanding of many of the

3

insolvency funds is, they're not real funds.

4

is just, they assess all the insurance companies for

5

whatever has to be paid.

6

the other policyholders, except in the sense that they

7

would assess all policyholders generally.

8

9

What they do

They do not necessarily assess

The last two points I make, and it is extremely
quick, is his notion that actual damages makes somebody

10

whole flies into the face of all economic analysis.

It

11

doesn't discount the opportunity cost and others, and I

12

would refer the Court on that point to an able opinion by

13

Judge Easterbrook in the context of a RICO case, and it is

14

Mosler v. the S&P Enterprises, and the relevant page is

15

888 Fed.2d at 1143-44.

16

And as to the general economic analysis of the

effect of triple damages, the studies particularly under

the antitrust law is, they result in actual settlements

phrases in the law, actual doesn't really mean actual.

MR. BLAKEY:

QUESTION:

prohibits the insurance companies to defraud their

to each of you respondents' Exhibit Number 1, which is the

2

actual text of the statute from the statutes at large, and

3

you can see it right on the face of the statute.

4

I've highlighted the five places in that statute

5

that adjust the relationship between Federal and State

law.

7

You start at the bottom.

Section 4 preserves

8

labor law under a standard of, to affect in any manner.

9

That's the typical preemption of Federal labor law of all

10

State law.

That's no privileges of State law in that.
Section 3(b) preserves the Sherman Act insofar

12

as agreements to boycott and coerce or intimidate is

there.

15

It's fully applicable under this Court's

If you look at section 3(a), he got his reverse

16

field preemption for a temporary period of time in order

17

that the States could enact laws.

18

And finally, we move up to the crucial section,

19

but my point has been, this is a carefully balanced

20

statute that privileges Federal law sometimes and State

21

law the other, and for him to want to interpret it in

22

light of one of its purposes and not its others is to

23

forget that this is a compromise, not a recognition of a

24

jurisprudential proposition that State law is more

25

important than Federal.

What he's done is, he's unhooked impairment from

any limitation.

Indeed, he suggests that the word impair

5

is derived from 3270, which was the original McCarran-

6

Ferguson Act as introduced, but if you go to 3270, what it

7

said in that context was, apply to or in anywise to

8

repair -- impair, and what happened between 3270 and

9

S. 340 is that in anywise was dropped out, and this

Court's jurisprudence teaches that if you drop language

out, it's presumed to be deliberate.
QUESTION:

12

I'm still a little puzzled, because

State law without impairing it?

15

MR. BLAKEY:

No.

No, on the contrary.

I think

that invalidate -- these words are not necessarily

mutually exclusive, but my argument is that if impair is

MR. BLAKEY:

Okay.

If -- suppose, in his

example, the State legislature squarely and unequivocally

said as against insurance companies in this State, only

5

actual damages can be recovered, and at that time it

abolished the State common law and it put an exception in

the State RICO so there wasn't insurance fraud there, and

the only way you could get -- or even more so, the only

interpret the word impair to resolve that hypothetical

problem?
MR. WALLACE:

9

The -- I think it would be, as I

10

say, a much closer case, but the fact is the State is not

11

in a position to tell the Federal Government what remedies

it can provide for patterns of criminal enterprises, and

13

to the extent that it purports to do that, it's a law

regulating the Federal Government rather than a law

RICO does not impair that statute, because the operative

words of that statute are the same which are at present

Is that your answer?

MR. WALLACE:

The answer is that the statue

would stand because the courts of the State, which are the

State courts, not the Federal court, would still not be

11

able to award treble damages under State law, but - QUESTION:

Well --

But they did not want the Sherman Act

8

9

That is quite correct, and there's

a special provision about the Sherman Act. That special

10

provision shows the limited reach of the rule of

construction, because that special provision says that

12

with respect to the antitrust laws if the State has a

are ousted except for boycott, intimidation, or coercion

so it shows that the special rule of construction is
