ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. KAYATTA, JR.,

9

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. KAYATTA:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
This is an action for plan benefits under ERISA.

12

13

Now, the plan in question in this case is an insurance

14

policy.

15

the Ninth Circuit has determined that certain claim

16

administration rules in this ERISA plan cannot be enforced

17

in this Federal action because California courts would not

18

enforce those same claim administration rules under common

19

law principles that are regularly applied by California

20

courts in breach of insurance contract cases.

21

It is not a self-funded plan.

Citing this fact,

There are two basic flaws to this holding.

22

First, the Ninth Circuit has disregarded Congress' intent

23

to create uniform exclusively Federal rules for claims

24

administration and enforcement without reference to

25

varying State laws, even State laws that regulate

1

insurance.
Second and independently, the Ninth Circuit has

2

3

misapplied ERISA's statutory preemption clause by

4

determining that California's notice prejudice rule is a

5

rule that regulated insurance and by determining that a

6

rule of California common law that precludes a plan

7

administrator from doing what Congress says the

8

administrator can do does not relate to an employee

9

benefit plan.
QUESTION:

10

Well, you do agree that, even under

11

ERISA, a State law that satisfies McCarran-Ferguson Act

12

requirements is not preempted?

13

MR. KAYATTA:

There is a savings clause?

We agree there is a savings

14

clause.

15

McCarran-Ferguson is automatically saved.

16

a law that satisfies the definition of business of

17

insurance that this Court could determine is not a law

18

which regulates insurance.

19

We do not agree that any law that satisfies
You could have

Secondly and more importantly, this Court has

20

held in Pilot Life,

21

again in John Hancock,

22

saved under the savings clause are preempted if they stand

23

as an obstacle to one of Congress' purposes in enacting

24

ERISA or in a specific provision.

1

ERISA, because if you did that wouldn't you have to call

2

every one of them in favor of the beneficiary, because the

3

purpose of ERISA was to protect people's insurance,

4

workers' insurance, right?

5

ERISA wasn't passed to make life easy for insurers.
MR. KAYATTA:

6

Isn't that the -- I mean,

ERISA made a number of balances.

7

One of its primary purposes was to make employers more

8

likely to have these plans to benefit workers.

9

the major benefit that ERISA produces for employees, and

10

it has been fabulously successful, in large part because

11

of what this Court did in Pilot Life.

That is

Now, having said that, I agree with you that an

12

13

amorphous purpose of ERISA without some clear foundation

14

in the record is not enough to preempt a law that would

15

otherwise be saved.

16

QUESTION:

Well, what does the savings clause

17

save?

18

would require modification is that if you have a policy

19

term and it's something written into the policy, that

20

wipes away the savings clause.

21

It's not given to private ordering to do away with the

22

savings clause.

23

One argument that you made that I thought certainly

MR. KAYATTA:

And that can't be right.

We agree with that, Your Honor,

24

and we're not saying that you can do away with the savings

25

clause.

The savings clause -- we also agree that the

1

analysis starts with the presumption that State law is

2

saved.

3

says, is this within the savings clause?

4

However, the second stage of the analysis then

And the third stage, and this is the stage we're

5

talking about now, says even if it is within the savings

6

clause it will not stand, it will be preempted, in certain

7

circumstances.

8

one identified by this Court in Pilot Life and reaffirmed

And the most important circumstance is the

in Taylor and Hancock, which is when you go to the heart
10

of ERISA's -- Congress did not do many things in ERISA.

11

It left the

12

welfare plans, totally alone and silent.

13

substantive benefits of plans, particularly

But what it directed its attention to was

14

erecting a comprehensive, uniform Federal civil

15

enforcement scheme modeled after section 301 of the LMRA.

16

And you cannot -- this Court has held that that purpose is

17

not to be frustrated.

18

QUESTION:

Why couldn't the Federal scheme adopt

1

the same rule as California?

20

proposition of general contract law in California and

21

other States, would you have any objection to the Federal

22

courts -- I mean, let's say we remanded to the Ninth

23

Circuit and they say:

24

have applied this provision of California law; but as it

25

happens, Federal law's the same way.

I mean, if this is a

right?
MR. KAYATTA:

That would -- that would eliminate

one of the problems with what the Ninth Circuit has done.

4

QUESTION:

The one you just talked on.

5

MR. KAYATTA:

Yes, because now you would be

6

doing what Congress said for the courts to do and what you

7

told the courts to do, which is in a 502(a) action apply

8

the statute and as necessary develop a uniform body of

9

Federal common law.

So if you're now saying, okay, we're

10

not going to have a Federal court's decision in an ERISA

11

action as to how to interpret a plan mandated by a State

12

common law, we're going to develop Federal common law,

13

then the Court would confront several other questions.

14

One would be are we going to develop a common

15

law that conflicts with any other substantive provisions

16

of ERISA, and there are two in particular which the Court

17

would need to pay attention to.

18

identified by this Court as one of the core aspects of

19

ERISA, which is the role that the written plan instrument

20

plays under ERISA.

21

say, before we go and say that the plan fiduciary must

22

not, as Congress ordered him, act in accordance with a

23

written plan instrument, we need to satisfy that there is

24

some other Federal interest here that would overbear that,

25

such as for example if you had a facial illegality of a

One is that which was

1

policy that might be a circumstance.
The key point is, though, that the analysis

2

3

would be one of Federal law and the Federal courts can

4

look to State law, the Restatement states courts law

5

around the country, to inform itself as to what the common

6

law might be on a uniform Federal basis.
QUESTION:

7
8

question.

May I interrupt just for one

I just don't know the answer because I don't

have the Act clearly enough in mind.

Was the term of the

10

Act, the term that you just used,

11

instrument," as distinct from something like, say, "terms

12

of the plan," a more generic term?
MR. KAYATTA:

13

"written plan

I do not believe the three words

14

"written plan instrument" appear in a row.

15

it says is "written plan document."
QUESTION:

16

However, what

So it's referring to the words.

What

17

I'm getting at is, and I think you've answered my -- the

18

question that was in the back of my mind -- is would we

1

have to say that the terms of the plan as ERISA used it

20

might be the terms of the plan as modified by applicable

21

State law?

22

I think your answer implicit in what you said is

23

no, because ERISA is referring to the document and the

24

document cannot possibly include an accommodation of State

25

law, a modification of its terms.

Is that fair?

MR. KAYATTA:

1

And we're now addressing,

2

understand your question correctly, not to 301,

3

preemption that we talked about in the beginning.

QUESTION:

Right.

QUESTION:

MR. KAYATTA:

if I

I'm jumping ahead.

Now we're on to the written plan.

Yes.
And I think this Court in Curtiss

8

Wright captured it this way, that reliance on the face of

9

the written plan document -- those were this Court's words

10

-- is one of ERISA's core functional requirements.
QUESTION:

11

If ERISA uses the word "document,"

12

that's -- even without any other explication from us,

13

that's pretty strong language for your position.

14

MR. KAYATTA:

Yes,

it is.

And ERISA section

15

404(a) (1) (D)

specifically in Congress' words requires that

16

the fiduciary act in accord with the plan documents.

17

QUESTION:

Okay.

18

QUESTION:

And the savings clause is shoved

19

aside,

20

California law had said the people who make benefit claims

21

take time to get their act together, so we are mandating a

22

two-year proof of claim period, and if insurers put in

23

their policies anything less than that it doesn't count.

24

Suppose that were the California law and California said,

25

we are adopting this to regulate insurance,

then,

QUESTION:

MR. KAYATTA:

I do not think that a State could

do that with the specific one, because in that situation,

21

even though you would have a facial illegality of the

22

policy if the underlying rule were saved,

23

example the rule in Metropolitan-Massachusetts, but here

24

the underlying rule is a dictate to Federal courts as to

25

how they must enforce or interpret language in the plan,

MR. KAYATTA:

1

Well, the answer would -- the

2

answer to this particular question, we would get over one

3

hump.

We would have a facially illegal policy if it did.
QUESTION:

4

Well, let's make it even easier than

5

that.

6

many, maybe most, States, the policy terms have to be

7

submitted to the insurance commissioner before a policy

8

can be sold using those terms.

I don't know how it works in California, but in

That's right.

QUESTION:

11

approve the policy.

12

these particular terms in it:

13

absent prejudice.

14

would not even have the issue in front of us because it

15

would have been perfectly proper under ERISA for

16

California to say you can't sell the policy; if they did

17

sell the policy, it would have the terms in it that we're

18

arguing about?

19

The commissioner says:

I won't

No policy gets approved unless it has
Time is not of the essence

And in that case do you concede that we

MR. KAYATTA:

In that -- we're not conceding

20

that, because in that circumstance what California would

21

be doing is directing its attention not to the 502 issue,

22

but to the other provisions in ERISA which say and

23

delegate to the Secretary the authority to promulgate

24

regulations on claims administration matters.

25

be the problem with a statute that said this, is it would

That would

1

be California saying, no matter what the Secretary says is

2

a reasonable claims procedure --

3

QUESTION:

I see your argument.

4

MR. KAYATTA:

So I'm off to a different argument

5

here, which is why that statute would not work.

6

statute -- and that's why --

7

QUESTION:

That

But that's ultimately, I suppose,

8

your answer to Justice Ginsburg's question, too, then.

9

mean, you're not caviling, because you say at the end of

I

10

the day, no matter how you do it, if the State purports to

11

require this term, it is in fact violating the plenary

12

grant of authority over administration, which is Federal.

13
14

MR. KAYATTA:

Well, I'm saying two things, yes,

and perhaps you're saying it better than I am.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. KAYATTA:

I'm sure I'm not.
I think how the State does it does

17

make a difference, and I can come back to it if you like.

18

But yes, in either situation it would not be the State

19

purporting to do something substantive that Congress has

20

not directed its attention to.

21

QUESTION:

Well, supposing that a State wanted

22

to impose on your client this requirement of notice and

23

prejudice in submitting claims.

24

do it?

25

MR. KAYATTA:

Is there any way it could

Well, practically it certainly

could, because any State bar of that sort insurance

companies will comply with.
QUESTION:

3
4
5

Well, but that's not an answer in a

court.
MR. KAYATTA:

And as a legal matter, I do not

6

think a court can dictate -- a State can dictate the

7

claims administration procedures under an ERISA plan.

8

don't get to that question.
QUESTION:

We

So what is your answer to my

10

question, that there is no way a State can legally require

11

the sort of notice and prejudice with respect to claims

12

that California has here?

13
14
15

MR. KAYATTA:

In an ERISA plan, as a matter of

imposing State law, that's correct.
QUESTION:

So that your case -- there's a lot of

16

talk in the briefs about this being a common law rule.

17

That's really irrelevant to your position?

18

same if it were a statute or a regulation of the insurance

1

commissioner of California; is that correct?

20

MR. KAYATTA:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. KAYATTA:

It'd be the

No, it's not, Justice Stevens.

I thought you told the Chief it was.
It is not irrelevant because the

23

fact that it was a common law rule I think means that this

24

isn't even that case.

Yes, but would produce the same

result in your view --

2

MR. KAYATTA:

3

QUESTION:

4

Yes.

-- whether it were a common law rule,

a statute, or a regulation by an insurance commissioner?
MR. KAYATTA:

5

Yes, we would get to the same

6

result, for a different reason, for a reason that is also

7

applicable here.

8

reasons that is applicable here, that being our argument

But we would lose one of the other

that a common law rule of this type does not regulate
10

insurance.
QUESTION:

11

I don't understand that because what

12

business is it of the Federal statute what -- how a State

13

makes its law, whether the State makes its law through its

14

courts, through its administrative agencies, through its

15

legislature.

16

I thought ERISA itself makes that clear, that

17

the savings clause saves State law, and then it's up to

18

the State, not the feds, to tell the State how it's going

1

to go about making its laws.

20

as well as administrative law as well as -- ERISA doesn't

21

put a statute on a higher plane than a court decision,

22

does it?

Doesn't ERISA save court law

So that poses the question, what did Congress

QUESTION:

That's back to Swift against Tyson,

you know, where a statute had one level for diversity

jurisdiction, but that a common law didn't.

me it would be unusual for Congress to have reimposed that

sort of requirement.

Well, I don't quite see the

analogy, because the issue here is, given that Congress
10

said a law which regulates insurance, did it have in mind

11

common laws of this type, particularly --

12

QUESTION:

General common laws.

Mr. Kayatta, am

13

I not correct that you would say a statute would be just

14

as bad under your "doesn't regulate insurance" theory if

15

the statute were framed not as specifically as Justice

16

Ginsburg's proposal, but it was a statute which said in

17

all contracts, not just insurance contracts, in all

18

contracts either party -- well, time is not of the essence

1

unless there's prejudice?

20

MR. KAYATTA:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct.

You would say that that fails for two

22

reasons, both because it impinges upon the administration

23

of the scheme which is given to the Secretary and,

24

secondly, because it does not regulate insurance.

25

MR. KAYATTA:

That's correct.

MR. KAYATTA:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

What's special about this?

That is,

others, that have in them a phrase that says you have to

have to notify us or you still win even if you miss the

deadline unless we're prejudiced -- that's the rule,

right?

That's the rule we're talking about?

That is the rule.

And it only applies to insurance

And they've found no case in their

research that says it applies to anything else.

20

MR. KAYATTA:

21

QUESTION:

That's not what they've said.

Well, what I have them as saying is:

"Our survey of California law reveals no cases where the

State courts applied the notice prejudice rule as such" -

QUESTION:

-- "outside the" -- oh, "as such"?

2

MR. KAYATTA:

Yes, and the reason they say "as

4

amicus VACLI, the mechanic' lien case, a notice to a

conservatee case, a real estate case.

QUESTION:

Okay, okay.

Let's now make mine an

assumption.

So we assume it's an insurance contract.

them to death.

have dozens and dozens and dozens of regulations.

have to have big print and you have to have this or that.

12

Well, fine.

You

So what's special about your

13

regulation?

Why does 502, which just says you have to

14

have a procedure for recovery, suddenly preempt your

15

regulation when it doesn't preempt any one of a thousand

16

others that govern when you can recover against an

17

insurance company, when you can't recover, what their

18

contract has to say, what print it has to be in, whether

19

it has to be in English?

I like that one.

20

You know, what's special?

21

MR. KAYATTA:

Well, what's special is because it

22

purports to dictate the enforcement and interpretation of

23

claims administration procedures, and that is the one area

24

in particular that Congress meant to preempt the field

25

entirely on.

QUESTION:

Well, why is it more of a procedure,

a claims administration procedure, to say, insurance

3

MR. KAYATTA:

Why is the one procedure, but

Because we are in a 502(a) action

exclusively Federal actions modeled on 301.

In a 301

Well, this is a 502 action.

It

doesn't mean that there still can't be a rule regulating

MR. KAYATTA:

If you're talking about a rule --

18

QUESTION:

They did bring it under 520.

19

MR. KAYATTA:

That's correct, but the rationale

20

that this court adopted for finding that a 502(a) action

21

is an exclusive remedy -- and the State law might have

22

lots of remedies that would be fully applicable in a State

23

court; you can't bring them, you can't pursue them, you

24

can't get those damages here -- the rationale was

25

Congress' instruction that this be modeled after 301.

rationale for having the exclusive remedy in the first

able to determine the legality of their actions without

MR. KAYATTA:

1

If you say that Congress meant

2

that we would have 301 here, but with a savings clause,

3

that's the equivalent of saying we don't have 301, because

4

everything in ERISA --

5

QUESTION:

Yes, but we do have it.

6

QUESTION:

We do have the savings clause.

7

MR. KAYATTA:

Yes, everything in ERISA preempts

8

but for that savings clause anyhow.

Why, then, does 502,

9

as this Court found and as Congress intended, have a

10

special preemptive force by reference to 301?

11

because 301 occupies the field of enforcement and

12

administration, and in fact was the reason this Court

13

cited in Taylor for taking the extraordinary step of not

enforcing the well-pleaded complaint.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,

9

SUPPORTING PETITIONER IN PART AND RESPONDENT IN PART
MR. KNEEDLER:

10
11

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,and

may it please the Court:
I'd like to address several things at the outset

12

13

in terms of petitioner's argument that the notice

14

prejudice rule conflicts with provisions of ERISA itself,

15

before I get to the insurance savings clause.

16

counsel mentioned or argued that the application of the

17

notice prejudice rule would be inconsistent with the

18

requirement that a fiduciary administer the plan in

19

accordance with its terms.

20

1104(a)(1)(D) of Title 29 says, it should be administered

21

in accordance with the documents and instruments governing

22

the plan "insofar as such documents and instruments are

23

consistent with the provisions of this subchapter."

24
25

First,

Actually, what section

clause.

is required to comply with State law in the same way that

3

the administrator would obviously be required to comply

4

with Federal law.

5

7
8

QUESTION:

So the argument based on, in effect,

on the word "document" is essentially a circular argument?
MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, because the statute itself

says only insofar as it's consistent with the subchapter,
which itself incorporates State law.

10

The other point that's been argued is that

11

section 503 of ERISA, which requires plans to have claims

12

adjudication procedures in accordance with regulations of

13

the Secretary, somehow occupies the field or ousts any

14

notice -- any application of a rule like the notice

15

prejudice rule.

16

And we think that is also incorrect.

Section

17

503 says nothing about the filing of claims.

18

Secretary's regulations under section 503 say nothing

1

about the time period for the initial filing of a claim.

20

21

22

QUESTION:

The

Could the Secretary adopt regulations

like the notice prejudice rule and then occupy the field?
MR. KNEEDLER:

We believe she could, but section

23

24

do not occupy the field.

QUESTION:

2

Mr. Kneedler, applying the same

3

principles, do you think that California's Elfstrom rule

4

is one that applies general agency principles or is

5

insurance-specific?
MR. KNEEDLER:

6

We believe that that's a general

7

agency principle, and in fact the respondent doesn't try

8

to defend it on any other ground, nor did the court of

9

appeals.
QUESTION:

10

Are you going to address whether this

11

notice prejudice rule is something regulating the business

12

of insurance?

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes, I would like to address

14

that.

15

Court really went through a two-step analysis.

16

and I think primary focus should be on whether the law is

17

one regulating insurance within a commonsense or

18

straightforward meaning of that term.

19

Life the Court held that a mandated benefits provision to

20

be included in the contract of insurance regulates

21

insurance within a commonsense understanding of that term,

22

and specifically focused on the fact that "contract of

23

insurance" is one of the phrases mentioned in the deemer

24

clause and that that was the sort of thing intended to be

25

saved to the States under the insurance savings clause.

In this Court's decision in Metropolitan Life, the

(800) FOR DEPO

The notice prejudice rule is directly parallel

1

2

to that.

You could look at it either as a mandatory term

3

in a contract, in effect, that untimeliness will not be a

4

ground for rejecting the claim unless there is prejudice,

5

or that it effectively renders unenforceable a provision

6

in a contract that has a time limit unless prejudice is

shown.
QUESTION:

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

That is, certain

under the McCarran-Ferguson Act directly, the Court has

clause seems to us to be broader -- it talks about laws

22

23

literally.

24
25

And even where the Pireno factors apply

We don't think,

I think it's important to look at the Court's

1

a State law, anti-subrogation law, regulates insurance

2

within the meaning of the insurance savings clause, and

3

that certainly did not allocate the risk, the initial risk

4

for the injury or the occurrence.

5

say that if the insured recovers on a policy against the

6

wrongdoer that there is no recovery from the insurance

7

company on that.
So we think the commonsense view of it is that,

8

9

What it did was simply

at least if the issue concerns something that is in the

10

contract of insurance -- and this Court said in

11

Metropolitan Life, referring to the National Securities

12

case, that the relationship between the insured and the

13

insurer, the contract of insurance and its enforcement,

14

are at the very core of what Congress intended to save to

15

the States under the insurance -- excuse me, under

16

McCarran-Ferguson.
We think the contract of insurance and the

17
18

relationship between the insured and the insurer is at the

19

core here as well of what Congress intended to save to the

20

States.

21

rule goes to the relationship between the insured and the

22

insurer and goes to the enforceability, one of the

23

important things saved to the States, of the contract

24

provision that is included within, either included within

25

the contract or is rendered unenforceable in the absence

What is the rule?

On the one hand,

the rule is,

it more as a factual question under general agency law,

fact?

combination of the two, because it depends on the

predicate fact that the employer has actually assumed some

20

responsibilities for administering the contract.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. EHRLICH

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

MR. EHRLICH:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
I think the place to start is back with the

19

savings clause in ERISA, where Congress said that any law

20

of any State that regulates insurance would be saved from

21

preemption.

22

define or add conditions to this by redefining the notice

23

prejudice rule or the savings clause to exclude a rule

24

that they characterize as administrative.

25

As I hear UNUM's argument, they are trying to

But in our view the notice prejudice rule can't

be accurately described as administrative, because it

2

changes a condition precedent for coverage under the

3

policy.

4

within a particular period of time and if he didn't do so

5

UNUM wouldn't have to pay.

The policy said that Mr. Ward had to make a claim

QUESTION:

6

Is that a question of coverage or a

7

condition for the payment of benefits?

I mean, when we

8

usually talk about coverage under the policy we usually

9

refer to the substantive terms -- what kinds of injuries,

10

disabilities, and so on are covered.

11

characterize it as a coverage provision?
MR. EHRLICH:

12

Is it fair, then, to

Justice Souter, I believe it is

13

fair because in its effect it determines whether or not

14

the coverage is available to the claimant in this

15

situation, and the State has changed it.

16

the notice prejudice rule alters the terms of its policy,

17

and in fact it's that alteration that forms the entire

18

basis of its claim that there's a conflict with section

19

502 .
QUESTION:

20

UNUM admits that

Well, it alters the terms, but it

21

doesn't necessarily alter the coverage.

22

- the terms include more than what the coverage is.

QUESTION:

Where you have to mail your notice,

is that -- is that a coverage provision?
MR. EHRLICH:

No, I wouldn't say that's a

5

provision or the requirement in its policy that if you

6

don't meet it we don't have to pay your claim.

7

goes directly to whether coverage exists for Mr. Ward, and

8

California has said that that kind of --

9

QUESTION:

But here UNUM has treated the claims

They could say the same thing about

10

the wrong address:

11

address and therefore you're not covered.

12

coverage provision, too.

13

So that

You sent your thing to the wrong

MR. EHRLICH:

So that's a

I don't know that -- the word

14

"coverage" is not what Congress put in the savings clause.

15

It says "any law that regulates insurance."

16

the notice prejudice rule is seen as a rule that somehow

17

only applies to the administration of the policy, I'm not

18

sure that that suddenly automatically means that it's not

19

within the scope of the savings clause.

20

So even if

I have a great difficulty, I think UNUM has

21

great difficulty, or would have difficulty, in trying to

22

square its argument with the Court's holding in FMC, where

23

the Court said that the anti-subrogation law, which

24

doesn't affect the coverage of the policy -- the insurer

25

still has to pay, but may be entitled after the fact to

2

the insured can recover it from a third party.

3

Pennsylvania passed a law saying you can't have that kind

of term.

And

And the Court said that that law invalidated the

subrogation provisions and therefore it controlled the

terms of the insurance policy and therefore it was a law

that regulated insurance.

Doesn't that -- doesn't that change

But here California by rule has categorically

each other, there's no notice prejudice rule.

And although UNUM has cases where the words

8

Suppose, suppose the Secretary

9

decided that this just makes the administration of plans

impossible, that every plan administrator has to figure
out what the law is in 50 different States and go through

12

the same job of determining whether it is narrowly applied

to insurance or it's a general law and so forth, and he

says:

5

Can the Secretary do that, to all plans?

We're going to adopt a rule that'll apply to all.

MR. EHRLICH:

So as I understand your question,

would it be valid if the Secretary under its authority

under section 503 adopted a rule, and would that preempt

the field?

QUESTION:

1

Of course, the government doesn't

2

like that.

3

But it seems to me that if this is indeed the regulation

4

of insurance the Secretary has no control over it.

5

The government wants to have it both ways.

MR. EHRLICH:

The Secretary's power is obviously

6

delimited by the terms of what Congress gave the Secretary

7

in ERISA and what Congress -- part of what the Secretary

8

has to work with is the fact that laws that regulate

9

insurance are saved.
QUESTION:

10

But I mean, you know, that doesn't

11

help your case a whole lot, because that means that there

12

could be all sorts of different rules in different States

13

pertaining to the administration of insurance plans, and

14

they would all be applicable.

15

MR. EHRLICH:

And it could make -- it's clear that

Congress wanted administration of these plans to be

simple.

MR. EHRLICH:

I suppose that when the rule --

there are rules of administration and rules that go

directly to whether the claim's going to be paid.

than the rules that the Court has already found regulate

1

Court defined for the purposes of the McCarran-Ferguson

2

Act what the scope of the business of insurance was, the

3

Court said that if it's a rule that addresses the

4

relationship between the insurance company and its insured

5

or if it goes to the type of contract that can be issued,

6

its reliability, its enforcement, or its interpretation,

7

that's within the scope of the business of insurance.

8

9

It seems that the Court should apply the same,
or that Congress would no doubt -- that was said before

10

ERISA was enacted -- and when Congress put a savings

11

clause in that let States regulate insurance, that it must

12

have known that that might create some disuniformities.

13

And the Court has recognized that in Metropolitan Life.

14

I don't see any conflict here between the

15

ability to change the terms of the contract under the

16

savings clause and then the power to enforce the contract

17

once it's been changed or permissibly altered.

18

argument, which UNUM makes, would completely swallow up

19

Metropolitan Life and the FMC versus Holliday case, where

20

in neither of those cases did the insurance -- well, in

21

one case, in Metropolitan Life, the policy did not contain

just disappear because any time the State exercised the

2

power that Congress gave it to regulate insurance and

changed or altered the terms of the policy, then there

4

would be a conflict and it would not be enforceable.
So I don't see any conflict with 502, and

5
6

obviously the government doesn't see any, either.

7

I guess I would part also company with UNUM's

8

attempt to rely on this three-part Pireno factor that the

9

Court developed in a different context, which was to

10

decide whether the State law -- I'm sorry, whether a

11

particular business practice regulates the business of

12

insurance.

13

word "law" for "business practice," and as a result UNUM's

14

formulation would be:

ERISA.

17

UNUM has changed the test and substitutes the

Does this law constitute the

The test is whether it's a State law that

19

the category of laws that regulate the business of

20

22

And as the Court in Fabe recognized,

So in our view, where the State has changed the

MR. EHRLICH:

Justice Ginsburg, we didn't make

that argument because we were troubled by the fact that

19

what the Ninth Circuit appeared to apply were generally

20

applicable rules, and so it looked to us maybe too much

21

like the situation in Pilot Life, where the Court said

that a rule that was generally applicable in all cases

wouldn't be specifically directed at insurance.

the Ninth Circuit really didn't apply Elfstrom, which I

2

find very difficult to follow in view of the language of

3

the Ninth Circuit.

4

It said Elfstrom, Elfstrom, Elfstrom.

MR. EHRLICH:

It was difficult, Your Honor.

But

5

in our view, as I read the California Supreme Court's

6

decision in Elfstrom, the court established that if the

7

employer assumed these administrative duties then as a

8

matter of law it was the agent.

The Ninth Circuit

remanded for a factual finding.
10

QUESTION:

To see if it had assumed the duties.

11

MR. EHRLICH:

Well, another clue to what we view

12

as the way the Ninth Circuit read the Elfstrom rule was

13

the discussion of the Oregon case where the Ninth Circuit

14

sort of harmonizes Elfstrom and all other rules that are -

15

- might initially seem at odds with each other, and comes

16

out saying that Elfstrom is one end of a continuum and

17

there are other cases on the other end of the continuum.

18

And actually we read Elfstrom to require no more -- I'm

1

not saying it right because I hadn't focused on this.

20

the Ninth Circuit reformulated the Elfstrom rule so that

21

it was no longer a categorical rule where you simply said,

22

well, if the employer is the administrator then it's the

23

agent, and instead it said we look to the facts of the

24

matter on a case by case basis.

careful about simply adopting a provision that says

essentially everything that's in the Restatement of

14

Contracts or Trusts, as long as it is given an insurance-

15

specific name and applied and adopted repeatedly in

16

insurance cases, where it will be applied the same each

17

time because insurance policies by State law often have

18

the exact same language, so you will get -- and they

19

happen to be the source of a lot of litigation -- so you

20

will get lots of these cases having the same name.

21

that would cover essentially the entire Restatement of

So they become not

think when we're talking about something that is a
