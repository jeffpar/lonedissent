ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRA S. SACKS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SACKS:

8

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Over the years, this Court has spoke in

10
11

disparate, sometimes sharply divided voices regarding many

12

Confrontation Clause issues.

13

of one voice concerning confessions of an accomplice given

14

in custody incriminating a defendant.

15

consistently viewed as inevitably suspect, inherently

16

unreliable, less reliable than ordinary hearsay, and

17

presumptively inadmissible.

18

examine an accomplice regarding a statement incriminating

19

the accused lies at the core of the Confrontation Clause.
QUESTION:

20

However, this Court has been

They have been

The opportunity to cross

What if the -- what if the statement

21

of the accomplice also is a declaration against penal

22

interest?

23

MR. SACKS:

Your Honor, I think the -- the test

24

for that is as follow.

25

depends on many other things about the statement.

I think the -- the test for that

First, a court needs to look at whether it's

1

2

against that person's penal interest and then you start

3

with the test.

4

statement is such, the circumstances and whether one looks

5

in Wright at just the circumstances of making the

6

confession or the totality of the circumstances -- whether

7

the circumstances are such that cross examination of the

8

declarant, of the accomplice, would be of marginal

9

utility.

And then the question becomes whether the

That's the bedrock.
QUESTION:

10

Well, you -- you can say that about

11

any number of well established hearsay exceptions, that

12

perhaps it would have been better if -- if there had been

13

cross examination, but those have, nonetheless, been

14

rooted in the hearsay exception.

15

you've got to deal with not just the statements in our

16

opinions about confessions of accomplices, but also about

17

declarations against penal interest.

18

MR. SACKS:

And it seems to me that

I -- I agree with that, Mr. Chief

19

Justice.

I think, however, that in dealing with the

20

firmly rooted hearsay exceptions that were viewed as an

21

exception, if you will, under the Confrontation Clause,

22

this Court has observed that those exceptions were such

23

that cross examination of virtually any declarant who fell

24

within such an exception would be of marginal utility, and

25

that is not the case with statements of an accomplice for

two reasons.
One, with respect to a statement of an

2

3

accomplice incriminating a defendant, those statements

4

are, as this Court has observed and in situations where

5

it's against the accomplice's penal interest, that those

6

are inevitably suspect and inherently admissible.

QUESTION:

On the

Can -- can you give me an example of

a case in which we have held that a declaration against

10

penal interest which was also the confession of an

11

accomplice -- and that may be a fairly narrow class of

12

cases -- was inherently suspect?

13

MR. SACKS:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Lee.
Was there a declaration against penal

interest there?
MR. SACKS:

Oh, no question.

Your Honor,

if you

17

consider the confession of the accomplice Thomas in Lee

18

where the core of that confession is,

19

planned the murder of Aunt Beedie, Thomas would not have

20

been responsible at all for the murder of Aunt Beedie

21

absent that confession, as -- as was -- was noted in the

22

dissent by Justice Blackmun in the Lee case.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. SACKS:

25

is that Lee and I

Which several of us joined.
The -- the confession of Mr. Thomas

in the Lee case was unambiguously against his penal

1

interest, and despite that, it was held by the Court in

2

Lee that the right of Lee to confront Thomas on the stand

3

on cross examination was required by the Confrontation

4

Clause.

5

QUESTION:

So -- so, you think that our doctrine

6

then is that the -- if it's a confession of -- of an

7

accomplice, the -- the declaration against penal interest

8

is simply swallowed up.
MR. SACKS:

No, Your Honor, I don't.

I think

10

that -- that what -- that what a court has to first do is

11

recognize that there's a different test for custodial

12

statements of an accomplice that incriminated a defendant

13

than just declarations against penal interest.

14

that's what this Court was getting at in footnote 5 of Lee

15

when it said that in looking for whether there's a

16

Confrontation Clause exception for this category, the

17

category we're dealing with is not declarations against

18

penal interest, but confessions of an accomplice.

1

then what one has to look is whether the circumstances are

20

such that cross examination would be of marginal utility.

21

I think

And

I can imagine -- and I think there are

22

situations where -- because we do not ask for a per se

23

rule -- where there would be circumstances that were such

24

that cross examination would be of marginal utility.

25

types of factors that a court could look at would be, one

-- and these are all suggested by these -- by this Court's

2

decisions.

implicating himself in something more than he's

implicating the accused?

Two,

One,

is the -- is the accomplice admitting or

is there blame-shifting involved in the

6

sense that blame-shifting was defined by Justice Kennedy's

concurrence in Williamson?

8

the -- is the accomplice attempting to shift blame?

9

he's not, that's another factor in favor of finding an

exception.
Third, was the statement spontaneous?

Was the

statement done in response to leading questions?
But the -- fourth, was it in custody?

Because

14

this Court's decisions have also made'very plain that

15

situations in custody are different than a situation --

16

QUESTION:

Well,

it's made it plain so far is

17

admissibility of evidence against the declarant.

said that custody makes a great deal of -- of difference

20

so far as the -- say, an admission against penal interest

21

where the declarant isn't present.

for example.

MR. SACKS:

23

all due respect,

is a -- is a Federal rule 804(b) (3) case, that the -- that

1

the Federal rules, 804(b)(3), of a -- of a -- of a

2

statement to another prisoner, as in Dutton v. Evans, as

opposed to a statement in custody makes a great deal of

difference.

Justice.

And -- and that makes sense, Mr. Chief

6

This -- this case -- in this case you have a

7

situation where Gary Barker was questioned before Mark

Lilly.

9

motives of the police, but just to talk about the normal

The police -- and this is not to ascribe any bad

10

situation.

Mark Lilly is then questioned, but both of his

11

statements indicate, on the face of the statements, that

12

there was questioning of Mark Lilly before the tape was

13

turned on.

14

In the first statement that was taken from Mark

15

Lilly, he gets to a point where he -- where he says to --

16

to -- to Investigator Price in response to tell us what

17

happened, nothing that you -- you already don't know, man.
In the second one -- in the -- in the statement

taken by Mr. -- by Investigator or Detective Hamlin, the

tape is turned on at 2 o'clock.

say that there's something different about a carefully

than a statement that somebody walks up to somebody else

2

on the street or walks up to somebody else in the prison

3

yard and says, you know, by the way, you know, if it

4

wasn't for that guy Evans, I wouldn't be here right now.
But the bedrock it seems to me, Your Honor,

5
6

under this Court's decisions is you have a right to

7

confrontation and there's an exception to the right to

8

confrontation if the nature of the statement is such that
cross examination of the declarant would be of marginal

10

utility.

Now, that may be a hard test, but that's what

11

the Sixth Amendment is about.

12

QUESTION:

May I ask you, if you're at a break

13

in your argument, have you read Justice Thomas' opinion in

14

White against Illinois?

15

MR. SACKS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Yes.
How would you apply the analysis in

that opinion to this case?
MR. SACKS:

Well, you know, it's -- it's at --

1

the answer is that we would be happy if this Court decided

20

to adopt the view of Justice Thomas, joined by Justice

21

Scalia, in Wright because we believe that either under Lee

22

and what I would call existing case law or under the

23

suggestion by Justice Thomas in White and the concurrence

24

that a hard and fast rule be used for the Confrontation

25

Clause, we think that either way, the decision has to be

1

reversed because as I understand the concurring opinion in

2

White it would extend the right of confrontation to

3

witnesses who testify and to testimonial material such as

4

affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, and confessions,

5

and there would not be an exception for reliable

6

statements.

7

In the words of Justice Thomas at page 363 of

8

the opinion, nor does it seem likely that the drafters of

9

the Sixth Amendment intended to permit a defendant to be

10

tried on the basis of ex parte affidavits found to be

11

reliable.

12

So, although we believe --

13

QUESTION:

14

But, of course, this is not an

affidavit.

15

MR. SACKS:

Well, it's -- it's -- but the -- the

16

extension that Justice Thomas used there was formalized

17

testimonial material such as affidavits, depositions,

18

prior testimony, or confessions.

19

thrust of the concurrence -QUESTION:

20

21

22

And I think the -- the

It's or confessions that you relying

on.
MR. SACKS:

Yes.

And the thrust of the

23

concurrence, as -- as we understand it is, it would -- it

24

would divorce Confrontation Clause jurisprudence from the

25

hearsay rule.

It would look at the literal language of
10

1

the clause.

It would apply it to witnesses and to

2

testimonial materials and not other extrajudicial

3

materials, and it would be a hard and fast rule.

4

wouldn't matter how reliable the -- the -- those

5

statements were or were not.

And it

And although we believe that petitioner is

6

7

entitled to a reversal of the judgment of the Supreme

8

Court of Virginia based on existing law, we believe it's

9

also plain that there would be reversal required under the

10

view of the Sixth Amendment that Justice Thomas, joined by

11

Justice Scalia, had described in the concurrence in White.
I want to deal with the issue of firmly rooted

12

13

and whether the evidence in this case fell within a firmly

14

rooted hearsay exception mostly because the State of

15

Virginia and the amici in support of the State of Virginia

16

spend so much time on it.

17

QUESTION:

But before you get to that, may --

18

I'm a little confused about the declaration against penal

19

interest.

20

trying to introduce a statement that was made that was

21

exculpatory vis-a-vis the defendant, inculpatory vis-a-

22

vis the -- the person who was apprehended with him.

23

I can understand it if the defendant had been

24

to be confronted with the witnesses against you.

1

confrontation principle has been adopted widely throughout

2

the world in many systems where they never have a hearsay

3

rule.

4

that they go together, when in fact the Confrontation

5

Clause states a general principle of the right of a

6

criminal defendant, and that has been well accepted

7

throughout the world, including in places that have the

8

only qualification on -- on evidence coming is relevance.

So, I don't understand.

MR. SACKS:

You seem to be conceding

Justice Ginsburg, the -- the reason

10

why -- and conceding is probably -- is -- is probably too

11

-- too strong a word.

12

Court's current case law, as we understand it, we

13

understand that this Court's current case law has to some

14

degree linked hearsay, hearsay exceptions --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

We are -- we are -- under this

To some degree is an understatement.

Ohio v. Roberts just spells that out, doesn't it?
MR. SACKS:

As a general rule, but this Court in

18

Inadi indicated that -- that Roberts did not intend to

1

have its rule as a rule that applied in all circumstances,

20

and that, at least in the words of the Court in Inadi,

21

that -- that there -- there would be exception that courts

22

in -- that the Court in Roberts was not seeking to have a

23

rule that applied in all circumstances.

24

both Inadi and in White, this Court has disregarded a

25

portion of the Roberts general rule.

And in fact, in

QUESTION:

2

not in favor of excluding it.
MR. SACKS:

3
4

And in favor of admitting evidence,

That's truly correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.

5

But getting back --

6

QUESTION:

So, I mean, that tends to show that

7

you're going to -- so far as being able to exclude things,

8

you're not going to be able to exclude them if they're a

9

recognized hearsay exception.

You may be able to get them

10

admitted even though they're not a recognized hearsay

11

exception.
MR. SACKS:

12

With all due respect, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, it went way beyond a recognized hearsay

14

exception.

15

was looking at in White and Inadi, to situations where the

16

Court recognized that the hearsay -- that the evidence

17

there fell within -- and the category of evidence there

18

fell within a hearsay exception that was firmly rooted and

19

firmly rooted in the sense that cross examination -- and

20

this is in the opinion in White, adopting from the opinion

21

in Wright -- that cross examination of the declarant would

22

be of marginal utility.

23

that is linked with firmly rooted hearsay exceptions.

24

I don't think that this Court has meant to suggest that

25

merely on the basis of a hearsay exception, that you lose

It went in my view, in terms of what the Court

That is the bedrock principle

1

your right to confrontation.

2

that.

I think it's far more than

Now, to -- to -- to finish the -- the concept,

3
4

Justice Ginsburg, it's -- our understanding is on the

5

Court's -- this Court's current case law that there is a

6

link to some degree, to a significant degree, under

7

Roberts between hearsay, hearsay exceptions, and firmly

8

rooted hearsay exceptions on the one hand and

9

confrontation on the other.

We believe that even under

10

that standard, we are entitled -- petitioner is entitled

11

to reversal of the decision of the Supreme Court of

12

Virginia.

13

We also adopt the views, as I

-- as I said to

14

Justice Stevens -- we adopt the views expressed in the

15

concurrence in White in the -- and in the amicus petition

16

submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in support

17

of petitioner that would separate the notion of

18

confrontation from the hearsay rules.

19

We think that what has happened with the hearsay

20

rules is -- is that you've wound up with a lot of labels

21

and not a lot of answers.

22

-- as a lawyer as I grew up as an antitrust lawyer, and I

23

was thinking about this argument, and there is a phrase in

24

BMI v. CBS which -- which is 441 U.S. 1, which has nothing

25

to do with this case other than being an apt phrase, which

And one of my disabilities as a

1

is that easy labels do not always supply ready answers.

2

And that's the problem with firmly rooted hearsay

3

exceptions.

4

If you deal with firmly rooted hearsay

5

exceptions, as this Court has done, one has to not forget

6

why one is looking at that.

7

QUESTION:

Was -- was this argued to the Supreme

8

Court of Virginia in anything else other than firmly

9

rooted hearsay exceptions?

10
11

Was there any broader

principle urged upon that court?
MR. SACKS:

The broader principle that was urged

12

below in the -- in the Supreme Court of Virginia was that

13

these statements were not sufficiently reliable to be

14

admitted under the Confrontation Clause.

15

And when you get to the notion of firmly rooted,

16

the problem with the firmly rooted label is that some

17

courts, particularly some lower courts, forget why this

18

Court has asked courts to look at that.

19

looking at whether something is a firmly rooted hearsay

20

exception, one, you're supposed to be looking at whether

21

the evidence or the category of evidence falls within a

22

firmly rooted hearsay exception.

The reason for

23

And two, the reason for looking at it is because

24

this Court has observed with respect to some firmly rooted

25

hearsay exceptions that virtually all evidence within them

meets the constitutional norm and makes the declarant

2

someone whose cross examination would be of marginal

3

utility.

4

courts not to forget that that's the reason why we look at

5

firmly rooted exceptions.

And it is important for this Court and other

In this case, if you look at the key piece of

6

7

evidence -- and there's lots of stuff in Mark Lilly's

8

statement that shouldn't come in, but let's look at the

9

statement by Mark Lilly, petitioner was the triggerman.

10

That is not within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.

11

can start off with the principle that that is not self-

inculpatory.

QUESTION:

It's not a declaration against penal

interest.

15

MR. SACKS:

Well, you know, that's -- and -- and

16

maybe -- and maybe that's the reason to -- to just

17

overturn.

18

Justice, is that the Virginia Supreme Court got it right

19

when they said that Mark Lilly's statement was self-

20

serving, and then they got it wrong when they said that

went to -- went to weight, not admissibility.

Well, it's -- it's -- in answering

the broad question, Justice Kennedy, as to whether ever a

5

that incriminates the defendant could be a declaration

6

against penal interest that fell within -- that was such

7

that cross examination would be of marginal utility, I

8

could conceive of such a case based on the factors that I

9

talked about before which would be does it inculpate the

10

declarant more than the defendant, does it attempt to

11

shift blame, was it spontaneous, and -- and -- and

12

although I don't think this is so much a matter of

13

corroboration as adoption, whether there is a confession

14

by the defendant that matches in all significant respects

15

the statement by the declarant.

16

here.

17

That's not what we have

But I think as a general category, we're not

18

seeking a per se rule.

19

as opposed to under the position advanced in the

20

concurrence by Justice Thomas in the White case --we can

21

--we would concede under current doctrine that there

22

might be circumstances where a statement by an -- by a

the Chief Justice indicated in response to my comment, the

You would say no portion of -- I

10

mean, suppose the whole statement contains a number of

provisions that are inculpatory of -- of the declarant.

12

Would you say that those portions that are not inculpatory

13

cannot come in?

14

MR. SACKS:

I -- I think at some point the whole

16

that, Justice Scalia, you're quite right that our view is

17

that you look at the specific statements, as this Court

18

suggested under rule 804(b)(3) you look at specific

19

statements, and you take those specific statements and you

20

test those specific statements.

21

Now, at some point, it may be that the

22

confession as a whole is so -- is -- is so self-serving as

MS. BALDWIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

4

My procedural argument has not been argued this

5

morning, and -- and I will not belabor it, but I do want

6

to make the point that Benjamin Lilly is asking this Court

7

-- it is our position, is asking this Court to reverse his

8

conviction on the basis of arguments that were not

9

presented to the Virginia Supreme Court in a timely

10

manner.

For the first time in a petition for rehearing

11

below was where there was any argument that there was a

12

per se rule, that the Confrontation Clause did not allow

13

these types of confessions, although I understand it

14

sounds this morning as though the petitioner is backing

15

away from that argument of it being a per se rule.

16

certainly never made the argument, until his petition for

17

rehearing, about the nature of his particular case

18

involving a co-defendant's confession being some

19

subcategory of -- of the exception which is not firmly

20

rooted.

Mark Lilly was unavailable.

So, that was not an issue

Secondly, the timing or the -- the --or Mark

The arguments that have been made for the first time on

I don't believe they do if you

look at how -- how this particular hearsay exception works

11

and what the Virginia -- Virginia Supreme Court has always

20

It has to be genuinely self-inculpatory.

21

It's got to meet the general common law hearsay

He has to know it's against his interest.

Ms. Baldwin , I understand what you

I think this is a significant factor for this case, and I

2

think it completely distinguishes it from Lee v. Illinois

3

and any of the other cases that have found -- that have

4

found this type of evidence inadmissible in those

particular cases -- and that is that the only issue in

this case -- the only issue -- was who pulled the trigger.

7

given, it was quite evident I think that Mark might have

been charged with being the trigger or being directly

complicit in pulling the trigger or in doing the killing.

No.

In the Virginia Supreme Court

it was -- what was litigated under the State evidentiary

The Virginia Supreme Court found that this was a

In other --

They said regardless of the penal

interest exception, this is reliable, independently

that what they said?
MS. BALDWIN:

No.

They found that it met the

penal interest exception because it was a genuinely -- it

was genuine statements against his interests that he knew

were against his interests.

16

MS. BALDWIN:

That's what I thought.
And then in addition to that,

there was also corroborating evidence to show its

reliability.

And then in addition to that, the Virginia

Supreme Court found that for Confrontation Clause

purposes, that this was a firmly rooted exception.

May I ask on that question, in your

view, to decide whether an exception is firmly rooted, is

it sufficient that it's firmly rooted in Virginia?

So, you have to look at

Yes.

And if you've surveyed the States and

you find that a -- a given State, a hypothetical State,

that says, yes, we have a -- a declaration against penal

interest exception to the hearsay rule, however that does

11

not encompass declarations when they are by an accomplice

12

against a third party, which side of the line would we

13

count that State, as supporting a firmly rooted or as not

14

supporting a firmly rooted?

15

MS. BALDWIN:

I suppose the Court would have to

16

put that in the not firmly rooted.

17

to -- I think there's a -- there's a confusion between

18

something that's firmly rooted and whether the evidence in

So, that's a question we really have

to research the State laws at some depth.
MS. BALDWIN:

I think there are very few States

a lot of cases have said is that in a particular case, the

I think -- I think you

the fact that during this confession there were no

promises of leniency made, the fact that Mark Lilly had

the Miranda warnings given to him, the fact that he was

caught when he was arrested before he even had a chance to

15

talk to Gary Barker or anybody else to decide who was

16

going to fabricate some story, the fact that these were

statements against his own brother, the fact that he made

18

these statements and clearly the tenor of the statements

in the confession on the audiotapes was that he was very

20

reluctant to say anything bad about his brother -- in

21

fact, it was Gary Barker who said a lot more, went to much

22

more extreme and more detail as to what Ben Lilly had done

this Court would believe was not self-inculpatory, it --
