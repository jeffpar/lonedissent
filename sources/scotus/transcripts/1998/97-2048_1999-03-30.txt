ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. BROWERS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. BROWERS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Discretionary review by a State's highest court

11
12

should be recognized as an available remedy to vindicate

13

Federal constitutional interests before one comes to

14

Federal habeas court.

15

available remedy would foster concerns of comity and

16

federalism which have been the driving forces of this

17

Court's habeas jurisprudence for many years.

18

The recognition of this as an

The defendant, Darren Boerckel, brought three

19

claims to Federal habeas court which he had raised on

20

review to the Illinois appellate court, but failed to

21

raise in his petition for leave to the Illinois Supreme

22

Court, which he filed.

23

the remedy of a petition for leave to appeal as to these

24

issues should preclude his bringing them in Federal

25

habeas --

His failure to avail himself of

MR. BROWERS:

QUESTION:

4

Is there some research that is

MR. BROWERS:

If it's available, I neglected to

include that.

I am not asking necessarily for a uniform rule

No, I haven't.

5
6

Have you practiced other places?

The States are entitled to give whatever remedies

QUESTION:

The Seventh Circuit opinion, as I

11

read it, put great stress on the fact that the Supreme

12

Court of Illinois did not wish to get involved in a lot of

13

these things.

14

regarded probably more path-breaking than typical error

15

correction.

It reserved it for itself questions that it

16

But we really --we can't have a State-by-State

17

breakdown on this thing if the Supreme Court of Minnesota

18

felt differently that the rule would be differently --

19

different in the Eighth Circuit than the Seventh Circuit.

20

I think we have to have some sort of a national --

21

national rule.

22

MR. BROWERS:

I beg to differ, Your Honor.

I

23

think the driving force here is 28 U.S.C. 2254(c), and it

24

speaks to the right under this law of the State to raise,

25

by any available procedure, the question presented.

full provision is quoted at pages 16 and 17 of our brief.
The question is one for the Federal courts to

determine whether any one State court provides such a

remedy.

Boerckel's case, does Illinois Supreme Court rule 315

provide such a remedy?

QUESTION:

So, the question here is, in terms of Mr.

We disagree with the Seventh

the board that as long as there is an avenue, even if it's

11

the Chief Justice.

12

that you must exhaust discretionary, as well as mandatory

13

remedies and that you weren't taking a State-by-State

14

approach.

15

So, I don't understand your response to
I thought you were taking the position

But am I incorrect in that understanding?
MR. BROWERS:

No.

I'm taking a global approach,

16

but I could theoretically -- I could theorize a State in

17

which, for example, a State might say we will not hear

18

Federal constitutional claims.

19

purposes, whether that would be a legitimate rule or

20

not - QUESTION:

21

For Federal habeas

Well, let's stick in -- with your own

22

State and -- and what is the picture with respect to State

23

habeas?

24

must he exhaust not only his appeal of right, but also his

25

petition to the Illinois Supreme Court?

For a prisoner to avail himself of State habeas,

MR. BROWERS:

1

No, he must not -- he need not.

2

But State habeas is very different from Federal habeas.

3

And that analogy breaks down in prior Seventh Circuit

4

decisions, one of which is cited in this decision, called

Hogan V. McBride, which is an Indiana case, and Gomoz v.

6

DiTello, which is an Illinois case.

a default under Illinois law for failure to take a

9

petition for leave to appeal.

That's what the

is called post-conviction in Illinois, is somehow

analogous to Federal habeas.

Nothing could be further

QUESTION:

May I ask, you couldn't get State

18

habeas if you had let your appeal of right pass by, could

MR. BROWERS:

20
21

It would be an irrelevancy under

State law.

QUESTION:

It would be --

regardless of whether you did a petition for leave to

appeal or not, it wouldn't be a claim that could be

QUESTION:

Not a petition for leave to appeal.

3

Do you have to exhaust anything to raise whatever you can

raise on State habeas?

pursue your appeal of right.

MR. BROWERS:

QUESTION:

MR. BROWERS:

I thought that you had to take --

No, you don't.

You don't.

You don't.
But you would be limited in what

you -- you're always limited in what you can raise on what
we'll call State habeas, which is -QUESTION:

Well, I understood you to say that on

12

State habeas, you couldn't raise anything that you could

13

have raised in your direct appeal.

14

MR. BROWERS:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BROWERS:

Exactly.

Okay.

So, there -- I see.

They're completely unrelated, and

17

the analogy to Federal habeas completely breaks down.

18

cannot bring in Federal habeas that which they haven't

19

brought in the State courts.

20

what Illinois does internally has no relevance in the

21

Federal picture at all.

QUESTION:

One

So, any attempt to look at

Mr. Browers, I think I -- I would not

have difficulty in accepting your -- your general

proposition that if there is discretionary -- that if

there is an avenue of discretionary relief available under

2

But here there seems to be a further feature.

3

The feature here is that the -- that the statute providing

4

-- I'm sorry -- that the rules of the court that implement

5

this discretionary avenue of appeal to the State supreme

court give some examples of the sorts of things that they

7

are interested in in exercising their discretion.

8

the -- as the I think the Chief justice alluded to a

9

moment ago, they -- they sound like -- they sound like

And as

10

sort of, for lack of a better term, broad policy

11

questions, path-breaking kinds of questions, rather than

12

fact or case-specific questions.

13

This particular petitioner had what sounded to

14

me like the most case-specific questions in the world, you

15

know, was -- was my -- was my confession truly voluntary

16

and so on.

17

When a State gives signals, as I think the

18

Illinois Supreme Court has given signals, about what it is

19

interested in, why then shouldn't the rule be that if your

20

case does not fall within the kinds of examples that the

21

State supreme court says it's interested in, you don't

22

have to exhaust because it would be futile to do it, or

23

almost always futile?

24

but it would almost always be futile.

look at the nature of Federal habeas.

In Brecht v.

Abramson, this Court described it as an extraordinary

remedy for those who are grievously wronged and something

qualitatively different than reversible error on a direct

appeal.

Now, if claims are so extraordinary, like Darren

Boerckel's, that they're to be brought into Federal court,

11

why are they too extraordinary for a State supreme court?

The -- the notion that a claim is merely fact-specific or

He's been through three levels of -- he's

QUESTION:

Mr. Browers, I'm curious.

I'm

15

MR. BROWERS:

16

QUESTION:

I am too.

Do you have any explanation for that?

Is it -- is it that when issues are significant enough to

the opportunity.

The various circuit courts of appeals, cited in

footnote 32, I believe it is, of our brief -- those that

accept our position rely on those very precedents, as well

question for a minute, what in your view would make a

difference if -- suppose the State had quite clearly said,

as South Carolina has said, they said in a -- they

17

published something called In re Exhaustion of State

20

litigant shall not be require to petition for certiorari

MR. BROWERS:

3

QUESTION:

Exhaustion is a Federal question.

So, in other words, your view is that

4

even if the State of Illinois were to say, we've thought

5

about this matter.

6

that if we say you don't have to exhaust in trivial cases,

7

we're also saying you don't have to exhaust in important

8

ones.

9

We don't want it.

We don't want all that flood of things.

10

That's our policy.

Nonetheless, we would have to say to

11

the State prisoners, you have to go to the supreme court.

We understand, says the supreme court,

We understand that, and we don't want to hear them.

Now, why should that be?

12

We don't say that

13

about post-conviction release -- relief in States.

14

would we have to say that?

15

MR. BROWERS:

I understand the lure of that, and

16

in fact, Boerckel relies on Arizona precedent doing

17

precisely that.

18

no.

19

Why

But the Ninth Circuit said, no, no, no,

This is a Federal question.
QUESTION:

I understand it's a Federal question.

20

I'm just saying that given our reading of the language of

21

the statute, the Federal statute, a reading that does not

22

take it literally because we do not apply it to State

23

habeas, nor a lot of other things, a reading that looks to

the policy, if we discover that the policy in respect to

MR. BROWERS:

2

I acknowledge that.

I -- I think

that aspect of this Court's jurisprudence regarding

exhaustion remains valid, that the States -- that the

Federal courts will not require a petitioner to do a

redundant action in State court.

QUESTION:

What I'm testing out -- and I suppose

8

you don't have an answer to it -- was Justice Kennedy's

I don't mean to be pejorative

I mean --

13

MR. BROWERS:

I understand.

I think that makes

a presumption that this would increase the number of

In 1996, the Seventh Circuit reversed itself.

1

I

2

haven't seen any appreciable increase or decrease in

3

petitions for leave.

4

initially hoping to get relief in the State courts and not

5

necessarily with an eye toward Federal habeas corpus.

6

I don't accept the proposition that this will encourage an

7

increase of either issues or petitions in the Illinois

8

Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

9

I think petitioners go there

Should we make an exception under

10

your rule for States such as, for example, Arizona that

11

have made clear, we don't want these?

12

MR. BROWERS:

13

QUESTION:

Don't come here.

No.

Illinois is silent, but there are a

14

few States that have said, we don't want them.

15

we should make an exception.
MR. BROWERS:

16

Now, maybe

The only exception I think would

17

be rational, since the question is a Federal one, is if

18

you have a State that has a rule that on its face shows

19

that relief is impossible with respect to Federal

20

questions.

21

QUESTION:

So,

Mr. Browers, to me this discussion

22

indicates that the point on which you and I disagree, that

23

there has to be some national rule, and you say, no, it

24

can just be State by State, that a national rule is going

25

to be very, very difficult to put together particularly if

5

I wonder if we don't need something more general

MR. BROWERS:

Well, I'm not sure the attitude of

the State is as important as what its rule is.

seeking a national rule, and for those States for which no

relief would be available within the wording of 2254(c),

uniform rule based on that line.

4

line to choose is the one that will require more petitions

petitions to be filed in the State's highest court.

MR. BROWERS:

No, I don't.

I would assume most.

11

But I'd like to back up to your question.

I

12

don't think this encourages laundry list petitions.

I

13

think one has to look at what is one seeking in habeas,

14

and to the extent that one is seeking to vindicate

15

constitutional errors where one has been grievously

16

wronged, I don't think inclusion of that in a petition for

17

leave to appeal to a State's highest court can be deemed

18

so minimal as a laundry list.

constitutional claim, and if one is really there, however

20

fact-bound it is, it's not onerous to require a petitioner

21

to raise it.

I think it's a serious

No further questions.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

1

MR. MOTE:

2

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

4

I'd like to initially address a question by

5

Justice Stevens regarding statistics.

We do, in our brief

6

in footnote 2, provide some statistics regarding the

7

number of PLA's and the number of -- petitions for leave

8

to appeal and the number of petitions for leave to appeal

9

granted.

And in the most recent 2 years for which those

10

numbers were available, the Illinois Supreme Court granted

11

petitions for leave to appeal in approximately 3 percent

12

of the cases.

13

I'd also like to respond to --

14

QUESTION:

That's 3 percent of criminal cases.

15

MR. MOTE:

Correct.

16

QUESTION:

Do you know what the percentage is

17

across the board?

18

MR. MOTE:

19

I'd also like to respond to -- to something Mr.

20

Browers said regarding three cases, three Illinois cases,

21

that had reviewed the kind of claims that Mr. Boerckel did

22

not present.

23

QUESTION:

Granted?

Excuse me.

No, I don't.

Before you go on to that,

24

do you know whether that -- you know, some States --

court of appeals and every appeal to the supreme court was

2

discretionary used to assert -- I don't know whether it

3

was true -- that cert was never denied unless the court

4

satisfied itself that there was no substantial error.

5

MR. MOTE:

That is certainly --

6

QUESTION:

Now, might not some State supreme

7

courts and, for all I know, the Illinois Supreme Court do

8

a -- do a quick look and if it -- if it has no reason --

9

at least no reason to think that there was an error, deny

10

it, but if it has reason to think there was an error,

11

grant it?

I mean --

12

MR. MOTE:

On that --

13

QUESTION:

-- we don't know what they're doing

14

just because they have a discretionary system.

15

MR. MOTE:

On that, there is an Illinois

16

opinion.

17

decision not to grant a petition for leave to appeal by

18

the Illinois Supreme Court is in no way a review of the

19

merits or a decision on the merits.

20

that would not be the case.

21

It's an appellate court opinion that says that a

QUESTION:

So, to that extent,

Well, Virginia had the same rule.

It

22

wasn't a decision on the merits.

It didn't purport to be,

but nonetheless, they claimed that they were really

24

looking for those cases that in their view were erroneous

25

and would grant cert if there was any real possibility of

2

doesn't still do that even though it now has an

3

intermediate court or that some other States don't do it.

4

I can't say for sure that -- that Virginia

MR. MOTE:

If -- I -- I think that Illinois

5

Supreme Court rule 315 tells us that -- that the Illinois

6

Supreme Court, like this Court, is trying to set itself up

7

as a body to resolve broad questions, and as in this

8

Court, if -- if a claim amounted to nothing more than the

9

right standard was applied but the result was wrong,

10

there's no indication in Illinois Supreme Court -- in

11

Illinois Supreme Court rule 315 that the Illinois Supreme

12

Court wants to hear that kind of a claim.

13

QUESTION:

Supervisory authority.

I mean,

14

that's one of the grounds that they say, and what in the

15

world could that cover except correcting an error?

16

MR. MOTE:

I think that what that -- what that

17

would cover is -- is allowing -- I think it has been

18

applied in cases involving allowing misconduct and in some

19

-- but that -- that is the most general provision --

20

QUESTION:

Yes, I know, and we -- we have the

21

same, and we use it, you know, rarely I will admit, but

22

occasionally we take a case just because we think it was

23

wrongly decided, if the injustice is outrageous enough.

opinions of the court where the court has ever said that

2

claims such as these should not be submitted to it?

3

MR. MOTE:

That -- that's fair to say.

4

QUESTION:

What about -- I thought you were

5

going to get down to a comment specifically on sort of the

number of error correction cases that in one way or

7

another the Supreme Court of -- of the State does

entertain.

9

entertains a good many of them.

10

Is that -- is that not

true?
MR. MOTE:

11

Numerically I have not looked at all

12

the cases.

I -- I have looked at the three cases that Mr.

13

Browers cited, and I think a close reading of those cases

14

or even a cursory reading shows that they did not resolve

15

the fact-specific questions that it would appear from the

16

Illinois Attorney General's summary they resolved.

17

example, in People v. Tulate, which is the case they cite

18

saying the Illinois Supreme Court has resolved a

sufficiency of the evidence question, what the question

20

was, was whether a -- a conviction for burglary to -- a

21

burglary with intent to commit rape could stand based on

22

no evidence of intent to commit sexual assault.

23

they said is that while Illinois cases had recognized that

24

an intent to commit a theft could be inferred from a

other felony.

3

It wasn't a normal sufficiency --

4

So, that was just a broad question of law.

QUESTION:

Okay.

Let me -- let me ask you a

5

broader question.

I just cited two or three cases because they were very

close in their subject matter to -- to this particular

case.

spectrum of the criminal law, either because it actually

I mean, the State's counsel said, look,

But he said that generally speaking, over the whole

reviews or because it -- it will remit to a -- a lower

11

court for review under its supervisory authority, the --

12

the supreme court actually entertains a -- a large number

13

-- lots I think was the term I used in -- in commenting on

14

his answer -- lots of these cases which seem to be error

15

correction cases.

16

As a general proposition, do you dispute that?

17

MR. MOTE:

Yes, I do.

And -- and I have not --

18

I have not done a -- tried to do a comprehensive review

19

of the cases decided by the Illinois Supreme Court, but of

20

the three cases they chose to cite, they are all upon

opposed to a likelihood of success in some other State

supreme court and where there's an intermediate court of

appeals?

5

MR. MOTE:

No, I don't -- I don't think this

6

Court should adopt a rule where -- where they look at it

7

and try to determine the likelihood of -- of success a

8

particular petition would -- would have.

9

would -- that would be very subjective and -- and put the

I think that

10

Federal habeas court in the position of trying to guess

11

what a State supreme court would have done on cert.

12

that -- that would be a very difficult thing for the

13

habeas court to -- to decide.

14

And

I do think in -- in response to -- to a question

15

of yours, Mr. Chief Justice, about the fact that this has

16

never been presented before, it should be pointed out that

what the -- what the Illinois Attorney General is doing is

authority to make that rule under both the Illinois

MR. MOTE:

In the sense that has been

In the sense that the -- that

the Illinois Supreme Court, while it says this is not an

8

the Illinois Supreme Court, like this Court, reserves to

And it's understandable that

QUESTION:

There's no rule providing for that.

MR. MOTE:

No.

But that -- that brings up, Justice Stevens, a

-- a good point, which is that this Court has -- has on

10

numerous occasions said that the any available remedy

language doesn't include, as Mr. Browers has put it,

12

redundant actions.

13

as this Court stated in -- in Wilworth v. -- Wilwording v.

would agree to hear the claim.

we're not -- this is not an exhaustion case.

that the language of the statute is complied with if the

MR. MOTE:

And -- and, Justice Stevens, under

And I don't know why, if we're just talking the

here.

9

MR. MOTE:

Well, this Court has previously held

10

that exhaustion within the terms of this statute refers to

11

whether or not there -- there are available remedies left

12

at the time the Federal habeas petition is followed.

13

that is one of the line of cases that the Illinois

Attorney General's position would require essentially

overturning.

it that.
MR. MOTE:

Your Honor,

I -- I would point out

3

that in -- in the habeas context, this Court has

4

previously held that it's not necessary to ask this Court

5

for certiorari enable to -- in order to preserve issues

6

for Federal habeas review.

7

-- in Coleman v. Thompson that the State's procedural

8

rules are entitled to the same respect as Federal

9

procedural rules.

10

And this Court has stated that

Given that and given the fact that, as we stated

11

in our -- our brief, the Illinois Supreme Court has

12

recognized that its petition for leave to appeal practice

13

is similar to this Court's certiorari practice.

14

effect of not asking for that discretionary review,

15

particularly when you're talking about just not asking on

claims based on the guidance given in the rule -- the

effect should be the same if we give the State procedural

18

rule the same respect we give the Federal procedural rule.

this question of just what is the right word because you

said it's not a question of exhaustion.

to go now, but it is a question of exhaustion,

SUITE 400

1

it's because you did not exhaust that last step in the

2

Illinois State courts that you are in this posture now in

3

the Federal courts.

4

MR. MOTE:

There -- there is certainly a -- a

5

connection between the two.

Procedural default comes

6

about if one doesn't -- doesn't comply with a practice

7

that's firmly established by the State courts.

8

that will mean at some point is that there was something

9

that wasn't exhausted, but as Justice Stevens stated,

And what

10

under the -- the way this Court has defined exhaustion,

11

when the time to pursue that possible avenue has run, then

12

it becomes exhausted because exhaustion talks about merely

13

the fact that it's no longer available.

14

QUESTION:

But it seems to me it's just the same

15

thing but you're calling it procedural default; that is,

16

you didn't exhaust the remedy that was there when you had

17

it, when you could have done so.

18

because it's time barred, and so the reason that you can't

19

proceed in Federal court you say is -- we're calling it a

20

procedural bar or something like that, but what it means

21

is there was a step to take and you didn't take it in the

22

State court system.

23

MR. MOTE:

Therefore, you can't now

There's a distinction, Your Honor.

24

Procedural default means not just that there was a step

25

that you could have taken that you didn't take.

It means

41

SUITE 400

1

that there was a step that you were required take and

2

didn't take.
QUESTION:

3

Well, if it were that, then you would

4

prevail because you're not required to petition for cert

5

in Illinois.
MR. MOTE:

6

7

10

And that -- and

that's exactly our position.
QUESTION:

8

9

Correct, Your Honor.

Do you know why your client waited

for 10 years after the direct proceedings had run their
course before filing for Federal habeas?
MR. MOTE:

11

I do, Your Honor.

It's not in the

12

record.

13

the record does reflect that Mr. Boerckel has an IQ of 70

14

and the State appellate decision reflects that at the time

15

of his conviction, his -- his reading level was grade 1

16

and a half.

17

filed was written by a cell mate of his, and it just

18

happened to be that period of time before he understood

19

and had the help to do it.

20

would have become aware of that option and -- and been

21

able to do something with it much earlier.

22

It's not in the record explicitly anyway.

But

The initial habeas petition that -- that was

Certainly most State prisoners

In -- in terms of -- of the decisions of this

23

Court that the State's position route effectively require

24

be overruled, there are the cases that draw the

25

distinction between exhaustion and default.

That includes

1

Coleman v. Thompson, Engle v. Isaac, Wainwright v. Sykes,

2

and Fay v. Noia.

3

There's also the cases I mentioned before,

4

saying that the right to raise by any available means,

5

talks about whether you have the right to raise by any

6

available means at the time the Federal petition is -- is

7

filed, and that includes some of the same cases.

8

9

QUESTION:

Well, then you're saying that

procedural default is the -- the what we're talking about

10

here rather than failure to exhaust.

Supposing that you

11

don't take an appeal from a judgment of conviction to the

12

Illinois appellate court where you have appeal as of

13

right, and the time for that goes by, is that a failure to

14

exhaust or is that a waiver?

15

MR. MOTE:

That -- what happens is the failure

16

to exhaust, when the time that you could take that step

17

runs, ripens into a procedural default.

18

QUESTION:

So, once the remedy is gone under the

19

terms of State law, it's no longer a question of failure

20

to exhaust.

It's a procedural default.

21

MR. MOTE:

Exactly, Mr. Chief Justice.

22

And -- and this -- this Court has said that

23

procedural default, as I said, requires violation of a

24

firmly established and regularly followed State procedure.

The Court said that in Ulster County v. Allen, James v.

3

QUESTION:

What do you -- what do you say about

4

the consequence which follows from your theory which is

5

that even where the issue that is sought to be raised on

habeas is a major question of State law which the Illinois

7

Supreme Court would have loved to reach?

8

no requirement to bring it, you don't have to bring it,

9

and you would -- you would say there is no -- there is

Since there is

10

neither a failure to exhaust nor a procedural default

11

since the -- whether to go to the Illinois Supreme Court

was optional.

13

which will be decided by a Federal --a Federal district

14

court in habeas simply because the prisoner chose not to

bring it to the Illinois Supreme Court.

16

And it's a major issue of Illinois law

MR. MOTE:

My response would be that Illinois

they draw -- you know, issues raising major issues of

State --a Federal district court would then have to

3

It's another chance

Mr. Browers suggested that if a claim is

4

important enough to raise in a Federal habeas, it's

important enough to present to the State supreme court.

6

think that -- that whole viewpoint is incorrect because

7

the mere fact that there's an alleged constitutional

violation, while it's very important to the prisoner,

9

doesn't mean it's important in a broader sense, that --

10

that the claim in that particular case, particularly a

fact-specific claim, be resolved.

12

But if a State supreme court wants to be --

13

wants the first chance to review everything that will end

says that you have a right and to exhaust your remedies

--we could even say there's no procedural default if
