ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID D. LAWRENCE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LAWRENCE:

10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case involves the valid service of a search

11
12

warrant and murder investigation in which the West Covina

13

Police Department lawfully seized 17 items of property

14

which they believed were evidence in that investigation.

15

The residents of the home, the respondents in

16

this case, were not at home when the home was searched.

17

The officers left a notification of the search which

18

provided a great deal of information.

19

pursuant to the authority of the Citrus Municipal Court.

Under California law, these police officers did

not have the discretion to release that property once it

of the court.

12

contacted those officers, that he was advised that he

4

would need to get a court order to get that property back.

5

The record is also undisputed that he was advised that he

6

would have to contact Judge Oki in order to do so.

7

The record is also undisputed that at most the

8

respondent, Mr. Perkins, went to the Citrus Municipal

9

Court on one occasion, approximately

month after the

20

seizure of the property.

The record shows that he asked

for Judge Oki.

The record is also undisputed that he took no

1

2

further actions to obtain return of that property.
QUESTION:

3

Because he didn't have the warrant

4

number.

And I was wondering why, since you -- as you

5

stated, you provided notice that there had been the

6

seizure, why it wouldn't be a good idea simply to have the

7

warrant number on the notice that's left and then we would

8

have avoided this great Federal case.
MR. LAWRENCE:

9

Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe

10

the record is clear that the warrant number or the absence

11

of it really prevented the respondents from obtaining the

12

return of the property.
QUESTION:

13

But whether that's so or not, it

14

would make it easier if you had the warrant number to look

15

up.

16

MR. LAWRENCE:

It might.

It might, but the

17

record is really bare as to what those procedures were at

18

the municipal court in terms of locating a file or

19

something of that nature.

20

And in fact, as we submitted, one of the

21

postdeprivation remedies the Ninth Circuit found to be

22

adequate in this case is the procedure of mandamus.

23

Certainly a search warrant is not necessary for that.

24

Mandamus is a proceeding that compels a public officer

25

like a judge to do their duty.

Penal Code section 1540

well and good and it may not violate the Constitution to

10

do what the city did, but like Justice Ginsburg, I wonder

11

why the city doesn't want to help its citizens by giving

them the information that would be useful, like a correct

that he believed he did not give the warrant number.

a number, but he felt that it was the wrong number.

2

Mr. Perkins and whether he received it or not.
QUESTION:

3

But if you have the number, as I

understand it, it's the Federal practice they leave you a

5

copy of the warrant so you have it, just a copy of the

warrant, right there.

That's correct.

The --

All it takes is a piece of carbon

paper and it seems so simple and would avoid snafus like
this .
MR. LAWRENCE:

But, Your Honor, the record also

12

shows that the warrant number was not the only way to

13

access that information at the courthouse.

14

shows that the information was listed not only by the

15

warrant number, but by the address where the search took

16

place and by the date of the return.

17

had both of those pieces of information.

18

warrant number would have assisted the respondents in

19

getting their property back, but the record also shows

20

that even after they were provided with that information

21

as early as January of 1994, they did nothing to get their

22

property back.

2

MR. LAWRENCE:

QUESTION:

4

MR. LAWRENCE:

I believe it was an error of law.

And what was that error of law?
The error of law is that notice

There is no authority for that proposition.

are cases where a person might be unaware that a property

right has been affected and that some sort of notice in

that context might be appropriate.

5

QUESTION:

I submit that that is

But even -- you know, even where you

6

realize your property has been taken, if you come home and

7

find your house has been ransacked, you still want to know

who did it.

11

MR. LAWRENCE:

Absolutely.

I agree with that.

And that -QUESTION:

Well, what if the city -- if it -- if

12

we were in a predeprivation situation and the city wanted

13

to take property of the -- the person, the citizen, now

14

you agree that due process would require giving some

notice to the person of the State's or the city's

intention to take their property.

required that the property was taken and who took it and

6

when.

7

9

MR. LAWRENCE:

And there was that notice

provided in this case.
QUESTION:

So, then the principle is there must

10

be some notice which gives the citizen the basis for

11

proceeding to claim the property that's been taken.

12

MR. LAWRENCE:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. LAWRENCE:

I think --

Would you agree with that?
I think in a case like our case

5

where they weren't home, that it would be unreasonable to

6

go into the home to search, to take items of property, and

7

to leave --

8
9

QUESTION:

Well, whether or not a search, it

would be unreasonable to take it under any context, and

then we're back in the Fourteenth Amendment not to search.

Due Process Clause.

2

MR. LAWRENCE:

3

QUESTION:

I understand.

And I want to know what the minimum

4

principle is.

The minimum principle is,

it seems to me,

5

you have to give notice sufficient to the citizen so that

6

the citizen can ask for the return of the property.

7

if that's so, then the only error the Ninth Circuit made

8

was,

9

application of the principle.

And

in your view, an over-application or an improper

MR. LAWRENCE:

10

If this Court views that sort of

11

notice, that factual notice, that a search has taken place

12

and that the property has been seized as due process

13

notice, then I agree, and I submit that the notice that

14

was provided in this case is certainly adequate.
QUESTION:

15

All right.

Why do you draw the line

16

there?

You've conceded that it is reasonable for due

17

process purposes to require at least an identification of

18

the person who took the property so that the property

19

owner doesn't have to start,

Why isn't it equally sensible to narrow down

apply to the judge for property seized under warrant

and saying go to the judge.

Somebody says, well, the judge isn't there and you can't

You go to the judge.

Nobody ever seems, until sort of

Why not then -- going back to my question, why

8

not then say fairness requires for due process purposes

9

not only an identification of the perpetrator, but at

10

least this simple bit of information which would make it

11

clerically easy to do what you have a right to do?
MR. LAWRENCE:

12

13

Because, Justice Souter, that --

that analysis looks at the facts of the case in a post

14

hoc basis.

15

that the owner of the property was Mr. Perkins, but when

16

the search occurs, like in this case, the officers don't

17

know who owns that property.

18

In this case we know -- or at least we assumed

QUESTION:

They don't know --

What difference does -- does that

19

make?

20

is unidentified to them, but they can give notice, as you

21

have conceded it is -- it is fundamentally reasonable for

22

them to do, to the person from whose premises the property

23

is taken.

24

result, why not take it a baby step further and say, if

25

you want to get it back, use this number and ask X?

They can't -- they can't give notice to someone who

1

Well, if -- if you're talking

2

about simply providing a telephone number to call

3

somebody -QUESTION:

4

I was talking about the warrant

5

number which Justice Ginsburg and Justice O'Connor spoke

of.
MR. LAWRENCE:

7

The reason is that there are a

8

variety of methods for getting that property back, and

9

whether one can get it back in the method that one follows

10

depends on -QUESTION:

11

Yes, but it's up to you, it seems to

12

me.

13

for getting the property back is.

14

what that method is, go to the judge, go to the police

15

department, go somewhere else -- that's your -- that's

16

your choice, but once you've decided it, why don't you

17

give the -- why isn't it reasonable to expect you to give

18

the information that will allow the person to take an

19

efficient first step as opposed to running the risk of

20

getting this kind of runaround?

21

It's up to the government to decide what the method

MR. LAWRENCE:

Once you've decided

For example, if there is a

22

prosecution, there is a Penal Code section 1538.5, and if

23

the Court looked at that, it is a tremendously lengthy

24

statute and whether one can get the property back --

with the proposition that appears in the brief filed by 30

States?

3

in the course of a criminal investigation, due process

4

required the city to provide notice reasonably calculated

5

to inform the residents where the property was and how to

get it back.

7

is the proposition of law and the question in this case is

8

how to apply it, or do you disagree?

9

And it says, upon seizing respondent's property

Would you say -- would you agree that that

I disagree.

On the portion of

how to get it back, that is legal advice that this Court

11

has never required.

QUESTION:

it back is mandamus and you have statutes which give

notice to the entire public at large, you're given notice

QUESTION:

Does the State have any obligation to provide a

means of getting it back short of suing the State for it?

MR. LAWRENCE:

QUESTION:

Exactly.

-- instead of having public statutes

4

that provide for mandamus actions.

5

MR. LAWRENCE:

6

A suit that says, sue me and

here's how to do it.
QUESTION:

7

Well, I take it that would be fairly

8

difficult because there were several -- there was not just

9

one remedy under California law, but there were several

10

different avenues that could have been preferred.

11

wasn't just a question of you could pick out one sentence

12

and say -- if you -- you're certainly not going to decide

13

to choose yourself among the remedies that the State has

14

provided.

15

MR. LAWRENCE:

So, it

That's correct, Your Honor.

16

There were a variety of remedies that these respondents

17

could have used, and there were a variety of other

18

remedies that persons in situations slightly different

19

than those in which the respondents were in --

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Lawrence, can I ask?

Because I

21

think when one responds to a lot of different questions

22

from the Court, you sometimes take positions that are not

23

entirely consistent with one another.

24

At one time I thought you had conceded to the

25

Chief Justice the Constitution did require some notice,

but that this notice was adequate, and other times you

2

seem to be saying the Constitution does not require any

3

notice.

Which is your position?
MR. LAWRENCE:

4

What I'm saying is that the

5

Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause does not provide a

6

requirement of notice in this postdeprivation context.

Well, by -- excuse me.

Could I just

Is there any

constitutional requirement of any notice in your view?
MR. LAWRENCE:

I believe the Fourth Amendment,

5

in the context of a surreptitious search, requires that

6

some sort of notice be provided, and that would -- that

7

makes the -- the seizure and the search reasonable.

QUESTION:

Can we be more precise?

Are we

talking about notice of the taking of the property or
notice of how to get the property back?

MR. LAWRENCE:

3

Right, and I think -- I think it

I believe it's required --

Because I think you -- you answered

me before that it would be reasonable to provide the

So, I cannot say in all cases

Well, give the devil its due here.

18

You -- you concede that it would be unreasonable not to

let somebody know that the State has taken his property,

20

and therefore it would be an unreasonable search and

QUESTION:

Yes.

And the reason for drawing the line

between that Fourth Amendment position and the due process

position that you take I assume is this, but correct me if

I'm wrong.

It's reasonable under the Fourth Amendment --

it is a requirement of reasonableness under the Fourth

Amendment to identify the perpetrator, otherwise the --

9

the individual has no idea where to look, whereas it is

10

not a requirement of reasonability to reveal the process

necessary to get it back because anyone who has been

deprived of property and knows the State deprived him of

it can look up the law and find out how to do it.

MR. SMITH:

submit that that is certainly something that this Court

was they found a situation where the due process rights of

the Perkinses was -- were violated because they weren't

given the information under Mullane which was reasonably

calculated to allow them for an opportunity for a hearing.
Now, what the Ninth Circuit then did is decide

And if the Court would look at joint appendix

I believe that in this case is that maybe the Ninth

10

Circuit, in requiring that information, maybe went too

11

far, but what the court was doing was using the Mathews

12

balancing test to determine what notice should be given.

13

And I think that even if the Court believes that the Ninth

14

Circuit went too far in giving all of this information,

15

still the affirmance of the judgment in this case is

16

appropriate because under Mullane, which everybody admits

in the earlier part of your answer to Justice Stevens that

2

if you had been doing it, I think the way you put it, I

3

might have filed a writ of mandate.

4

- I take it you mean by that -- a document with the court

5

saying, look, I need a number in order to get my client's

6

property back.

7

presume you would have gotten some relief if you had filed

8

that.

11

They haven't given me the number.

I

And if that is so, why really isn't that the end of

MR. SMITH:

10

I might have filed -

Because I don't believe I

necessarily would have gotten the number.
QUESTION:

12

Well, we don't know whether you would

13

have gotten the number or not, but I think aren't we

14

entitled to assume, in the absence of a demonstration to

15

the contrary, that the court would have done something

16

other than throw you out and say I'm not going to help

17

you.

18

Too bad.
MR. SMITH:

Well, the information is in the

19

record, is that the document was sealed, and the clerk's

20

office, the declaration of the joint appendix, 76-77, is

21

that you couldn't get the warrant number because the

22

document was sealed.

court, isn't it?

MR. SMITH:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
Okay.

So, if you -- you admit that

4

-- that there is a procedure whereby you could have gone

5

-- you could have addressed the court with a pleading and

6

said, I need this number that you have in order to get

7

back property that they took from me that they're not

entitled to keep.

demonstration that you would have been turned away

And in the absence of some

10

arbitrarily, we have to assume, I think, that there is a

11

process by which you could have gotten what you wanted,

12

and ultimately you would have -- your client would have

13

gotten the property back.

14

And if that is so, I don't understand what the

15

premise would be for constructing a due process right to

16

an alternative to that.

17

MR. SMITH:

The question is, Your Honor, is does

18

it require essentially -- and I don't mean to be facetious

-- some herculean effort by a citizen to get the property

back.

lawyer who could be creative in terms of getting that

property back?

I don't believe the Due Process Clause requires that.

or the Fourth Amendment is information which would

Well, that's one -- that's one way of

3

-- of stating the conclusion, but I would have thought

4

that what you have to demonstrated to get the due process

5

right that you claim is that it is fundamentally unfair

6

for the State to take the property, telling you that it is

7

they, the State, that have taken it, and then leave it to

8

you to figure out what the procedure under State law is

9

for its return.

10

Is that fundamentally unfair?

MR. SMITH:

No, I don't believe that that

fundamentally unfair.

fundamentally unfair not to allow -- not to give the

Perkinses the necessary information.

3

a policy by the City of West Covina to leave it to the

discretion of the officer, and that is what's unfair.

5

What needs to be -- what has to happen here is that the

6

Court I think needs to indicate that the city -- that due

7

process requires a policy where information is imparted to

8

a person to allow him to access the remedy.
QUESTION:

9

What we have here is

But we don't see any kind of abuse of

10

that discretion, if it was that, because the -- the police

officer did say the property is in -- in the court's

12

custody, so you have to go there to get it.

any misleading by the police except with respect to this

number.

MR. SMITH:

So, it wasn't

That's correct, and the police was

16

-- the police were right.

17

because if you got this note left at your residence, you

18

would think you would have to go to the police department.

So, I think it would be incumbent upon the city to tell

20

them what court you have to go to.

think that that's required.

He did have to go to court

They did that, and I

The question is did they give them the

to get in and -- and talk actually to the judge in the

QUESTION:

Would we -- would it have been okay

if they gave him the warrant number and it was the city's

What the problem is, is that it's an

What happened is they left it to the discretion of

But I think even under a Fourth Amendment

standard or a Fourteenth Amendment standard here, the

policy of the City of West Covina is deficient, and it's

14

deficient because, number one, if the Court looks at

precepts, and you have given us the example of 41(d).

2

why are we talking nebulously about not using balancing

3

and all that when we have a concrete example of what you

4

say here's what does it, here's adequate notice?

5

MR. SMITH:

So,

I -- I agree that that's a concrete

standard, that I believe that probably when the -- the

7

enactors of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 probably

8

went through what notice is required in order to

adequately inform the person or give them the information

QUESTION:

41 -And it's a very simple.

It's a copy

of the warrant.
MR. SMITH:

Exactly.

That's our position, that

14

the City of West Covina should come into line with what

the Federal Government does and what the rest of the

Further, in that case, the Court stated that

2

notice is a necessary element of due process when there is

a final adjudication, and the notice is to give the person

4

whose property rights are at issue an opportunity to

5

appear and to contest that hearing or to choose not to

6

appear.

7

a final adjudication or a hearing that notice could be

given up.

That is not the case here because we did not have

My opposing counsel states that they did not get

9
10

the property back or they could not get the property

11

because they did not get it, and the record shows that

12

even after receiving the search warrant number and even

13

after getting advice of counsel, myself, as to how to get

14

it back, they did nothing to get it back.

15

that that's not a very good test to determine whether or

not it was possible for counsel or the respondents to

obtain the return of their property.
