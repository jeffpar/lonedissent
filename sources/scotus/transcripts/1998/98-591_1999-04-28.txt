ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. GORDON:
please the Court:

Our case addresses both the issue of disability

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

reading of the statute and under this Court's decision in

17

A functional analysis establishes whether the impairment

Defining the impairment, simply naming the

The Ninth Circuit held that Mr. Kirkingburg is

20

disabled because he sees differently from other people,

21

not because he sees substantially -- in a substantially

restricted or a substantially limited manner.

Kirkingburg sees with one eye almost everything that an

average person in the general population sees with two

eyes.

And yet, on cert, we are to address

whether he was disabled.
MS. GORDON:

that the respondent did obtain a waiver from DOT and a

valid waiver at the time.

same unreviewable autonomy that the regs give a - - a

2

manufacturer the right to set production standards?

3

- is that basically your point?

4

MS. GORDON:

Is -

I think that is -- that is the

5

position under the statute itself.

6

standard may be set by the employer, and the EEOC has

7

applied that both to safety type standards, such as this

8

one, and production type standards.

9

QUESTION:

A qualification

But you don't -- you don't concede

10

that there is, in effect, any reasonableness limitation on

11

the standards that you can set?

12

MS. GORDON:

I think the reasonableness

13

limitations are twofold on the face of the statute.

14

standard must be job-related and consistent with business

15

necessity, and the second test is whether it meets the

16

direct threat test if it's a safety issue.

17

in this case meets both of those tests.

on the DOT and the DOT says they're not safe.

if there's a waiver, what the waiver means is DOT isn't

saying, given the nature of this program, they are safe.

1

QUESTION:

So,

if DOT says you're not sure, then

2

your client thinks they're not safe, the other side thinks

3

they are -- their client is safe, and -- and therefore, we

4

have a proceeding in a court and work out who's right.

5

mean, would that be the answer to this?

6

MS. GORDON:

I

Possibly that would be the answer,

7

but I would suggest that the EEOC itself has given another

8

defense, and that is in the Technical Assistance Manual at

9

page 4-16, they say that if you have a Government

10

regulation that requires an employer to have a certain

11

standard, if the employer is following that standard,

12

which this employer was doing at that time and continues

13

to do, that that operates as a defense and you don't have

14

to look at the business -- the job-related and business

15

necessity test.

16

QUESTION:

But is that -- have they taken into

17

account the very unusual situation where there is such a

18

reg, but then the agency itself gets a subgroup of people

19

and says, we don't really know whether it should or should

20

not apply here?

21

MS. GORDON:

QUESTION:

23
24
25

Yes.

I --

I mean, I would imagine the EEOC reg

is silent on that point.

that example
QUESTION:

2

3

Exactly.

So then, don't we have to

have the trial or the further proceeding?
MS. GORDON:

4

I don't think so because I think

5

you can find, as a matter of law, that when safety is an

6

issue and an agency has issued a mandatory safety

7

requirement -- and again, the waiver program was not

deemed safe.

When you're following a mandatory safety

absolute defense.

11

If this employer is found not to be entitled to

12

an absolute defense, however, it can easily meet both the

13

job-related and business necessity test and the direct

14

threat test.

15

QUESTION:

Ms. --

16

QUESTION:

Well, unless unqualified can be

17

determined as a matter of law, this case would have to go

back.

19

This person is unqualified as a matter of law because we

20

ignore the waiver bit.

21

requirements, and -- and we don't take that position.

22

then you can prevail as a matter of summary judgment.

23

In other words, unless we could say, you're right.

MS. GORDON:

We take as mandatory those fixed

Certainly this Court can take care

That's a direct -Just sort of thrown in there for no

No.

They were thrown in there

How can we find someone is not disabled who sees

The way we reach that analysis is this.

The EEOC would suggest I think that

that is too broad if you look at the entire national

However, looking at a narrow category of jobs like truck

1

Well,

I think the company would have

to provide evidence that they had considered that

objective evidence that Your Honor refers to at the time

4

that it refused to accept the waiver.

5

years ago.

It would not be

MR. HUNT:

If -- if new -- if it's additional

if we are?
MR. DUMONT:

8

9

Well, I would say that with respect

to this case, Your Honor, the best way out of that problem

10

for this case is to say that what happened here was that

11

the employer clearly viewed respondent as substantially

12

limited in the life activity of seeing.

13

The anomaly that is presented here is what they

want to say is that this is a person who can see so well

that he's not even disabled within the cognizance of the

16

ADA, but so poorly that he can't drive a truck.

position to turn around and say that, nonetheless, your

vision is so good that you are not even substantially

MR. DUMONT:

1

With respect, I think you're

2

focusing on jobs, and that's the wrong focus here.

What

3

I'm suggesting is that if you focus on the life activity

4

which here is seeing, not working, then I agree with you

5

that the statute requires us to say is there a substantial

6

limitation on seeing.

7

who has 20/200 vision without her glasses and with respect

8

to somebody who, because of a physical difference in the

9

way his eye is constructed, in effect sees only out of one

10

eye, we think that it's fairly clear that those people are

11

-- are substantially limited with respect to seeing.

But both with respect to somebody

And not only that, but if an employer adopts an

12

13

employment standard which is based on precisely that

14

physical characteristic, the inability to see better than

15

this, what they are doing is to treat that person as

16

substantially limited in his seeing.

17

QUESTION:

18

Dumont, that as a matter of law, a person in Mr.

20

Not as a matter of law that he's

disabled.

22

-- that's the qualification, isn't it?

2

certainly not the determination of whether someone is

3

4

MR. DUMONT:

Or perhaps -- but

I think the two are very closely

5

related, and let me address that point this way.

6

Under the act, under the definition of

7

discrimination in the act, it is discrimination to use a

8

qualification test that has a disparate impact on a person

9

with a disability, which in this case is certainly true

10

about Mr. Kirkingburg if you believe that his limitation

11

comes within the definition of disability.

12

QUESTION:

Except there's a defense if a

13

Government agency requires a certain standard, as the DOT

14

did here for vision for drivers.

15

MR. DUMONT:

16

QUESTION:

There's that defense -You have to get a license, and

17

there's a defense if the person doesn't have that license.

18

Isn't that right?

19

MR. DUMONT:

Absolutely.

There is that defense

20

and there is also the defense that, although you are in

21

fact taking action on this characteristic, it's

22

legitimately related to the job, it's -- it's necessary

for safety.

That's right.

blue eyes.
MR. DUMONT:

Because it's not an impairment

which the statute requires.
Here's another example of something that is an
impairment.

No, because we look to the language

of the statute and some language - - some language is open

Some language is pretty precise

An occasional headache.

there's somebody who's missing the third toe from the left

on his left foot, and in fact you can demonstrate -- now,

ability to do anything.

It seemed as if at the beginning this --

I've never heard of giving

So, are we just debating this

I think we are and I think that's

all we want is to go -- all the respondent wants is to go
back for trial here.
Now, I do think you can say that the Ninth

11

Circuit may have spoken a little too broadly, exactly as

my colleague said.

But I -- I would actually not agree -

You say a little too broadly.

18

MR. DUMONT:

If it's different manner equals,

19

but I wouldn't say it's entirely the wrong inquiry.

I

20

mean, I think the regulatory inquiry -- and that's where

21

that comes from is the EEOC's regulations -- the inquiry

22

is perfectly valid.

23

right-handed performs the same task as someone who's left-

24

handed in a different manner, that makes him disabled, I

25

think that is -- that might be within the Ninth Circuit's

That would be improper.

But I think it is true to say that simply

2

3

because somebody has what anyone would recognize as an

4

impairment -- I mean, suppose you started off with a --

5

well, many people who lose an eye midway through life, for

6

instance, will go through a transition period where they

7

have very poor depth perception, very poor vision in the

8

very beginning because they're adjusting, and then they'll

9

get better and better as time goes by.

Now, I think it -

10

- it would be wrong to pretermit the inquiry into the fact

11

that when they get to the end, they may see pretty much

12

functionally the same way for some -- for many purposes.

13

But it's wrong to pretermit an inquiry into whether the

14

fact that they have to do it through a different purpose

15

-- through a different manner is -- is substantially

16

limiting.

Suppose we say that under section (a)

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CORBETT GORDON

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MS. GORDON:

4

I just have two brief points I'd like to address

5

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

responding to points made by Mr. Hunt.
First, he was talking about the waiver program

6

7

as a proxy for safety, and I would like to call the

8

Court's attention to some things in the Federal Register.

9

At 59 Federal Register 59388, the Federal Highway

10

Administration recognized that its study was flawed and

11

has admitted that some of the waiver drivers were sub-par

12

performers who individually may represent an unacceptable

13

risk to safety.

14

November of 1994 after Mr. Kirkingburg got his waiver.

15

That Federal Register entry was in

Their own panel of doctors that advises the

16

Federal Highway Administration and other studies and

17

advisors over the years, as recently as October of last

18

fall, have advised the Federal Highway Administration not

19

to change the 20/40 each eye acuity standard.

20

that standard or a like standard has been in place since

21

1935, starting with good vision is important to safe

22

driving.

23

QUESTION:

In fact,

But how can you reconcile that with

24

the decision to allow all existing waivers to remain in

25

effect?

MS. GORDON:

QUESTION:

3

MS. GORDON:

I can't.
Oh, okay.
I can't.

In the same breath, the

4

Federal Highway Administration declared the current people

5

in 1996 to be sufficiently safe to grandfather them, and

6

-- and I can't reconcile that.

QUESTION:

Close enough for Government work.

I

think that's --

9

(Laughter.)

10

MS. GORDON:

I would refer the Court to pages 12

11

to 16 of our reply brief where various criticisms are

12

taken of the Federal Highway Administration's protocol and

13

studies that were in effect and available to them and

14

noted in their - - in the Federal Register that they

15

ignored.

16

The other thing I'd like to address very quickly

17

is the fact that I do not believe that the comment, he is

18

legally blind or blind in one eye, is susceptible to

19

construing the term legally blind separate from the phrase

20

or blind in one eye.
