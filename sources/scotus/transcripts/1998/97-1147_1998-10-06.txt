Mr. Backstrom.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. BACKSTROM

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BACKSTROM:

10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Minnesota supreme court has ruled that a

12

person who is present in another's residence for a brief

13

period of time for the sole purpose of engaging in an

14

unlawful business has a legitimate expectation of privacy

15

in the premises.

16

This decision, if allowed to stand, would

17

reestablish the automatic standing rule of legitimately on

18

the premises projected by this Court 20 years ago in Rakas

1

v. Illinois, and it would allow visitors to vicariously

20

assert the privacy interests of their hosts.

21

Furthermore, the Minnesota supreme court's

22

determination that an officer's nonenhanced observations

23

while standing in a public area outside the curtilage of a

24

residence constitutes an unreasonable search is

25

inconsistent with this Court's prior decisions and will

expand the exclusionary rule to the detriment of justice.
The defendants here presented no evidence that

QUESTION:

Mr. Backstrom, may I slow you down a

minute by asking you a question?

11

What if the State passed a statute -- I remember

12

years ago there was a debate on maybe all defendants

13

should have standing to challenge Fourth Amendment

14

violations, and what if a State passed a statute and said

15

that the defendant shall always have standing to object to

16

an unlawful search or seizure?

17

would be constitutional?

18

MR. BACKSTROM:

Do you think such a search

Well, Your Honor, I do not

19

believe that it would.

20

Amendment -- it was intended to provide protections to

21

everyone.

22

QUESTION:

I do not believe that the Fourth

I know the Fourth Amendment was, but

23

could the State pass a statute that gave additional

24

protection to a defendant without violating the Federal

25

Constitution?

MR. BACKSTROM:

1

Yes.

It is possible, Your

2

Honor.

3

they could pass different provisions that relate to this,

4

but this particular decision the Minnesota supreme court

5

decided based upon the Fourth Amendment of the Federal

6

Constitution.

7
8

9

States have independent State constitutions and

QUESTION:

Do you think standing is always a

Federal question?
MR. BACKSTROM:

Your Honor, I believe it is an

10

important Federal question, and when a decision is based

11

upon the Federal Constitution, as it was in this case,

12

then I think the Federal standard should apply and, as

13

this Court has been very consistent in applying its

14

standards, in essence a totality of the circumstances

15

test, which we would argue is the appropriate analysis to

16

be used in determining whether someone has a significant

17

enough connection to the premises to give them a

18

legitimate expectation of privacy --

19

QUESTION:

Well, given the reasoning of Rakas,

20

would it be fair to answer Justice Stevens by saying this

21

isn't a standing question at all, it's a question of the

22

substantive reach of the Fourth Amendment?

23

I had thought that the Chief, then Justice

24

Rehnquist, in writing the opinion in Rakas, went into

25

this, and said this is not a standing question, or am I

incorrect?
MR. BACKSTROM:

2

Well, Your Honor,

I believe

3

Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist, as he wrote that particular

4

opinion,

5

referred to as standing is a subjective issue in terms of

6

having to analyze the issues, but there's still -- it's

7

still important that a criminal defendant establish a

8

significant enough connection to a particular premise as

indicated that the question which was formally

to give them an expectation of privacy that society is
10
11

willing to accept as being reasonable.
QUESTION:

Yes, but that's a substantive

12

interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.

It is not a

13

question of who has rights to raise a violation.

14

a slight difference,

There's

is there not?

15

I thought that Rakas discussed this.

16

MR. BACKSTROM:

But -- Your Honor,

I believe

17

Rakas made it very clear that the appropriate test to

18

apply in these particular provisions is one which looks at

1

an individual's first subjective expectation of privacy

20

and then whether that's the type of expectation that

21

society is willing to accept as being reasonable.

22

Here, under these circumstances, we don't

23

believe that brief transient visitors that are in a

24

residence solely for --

hours, and you said brief time, unlawful purpose.

Would

2

it make any difference, in your view of the applicable

3

law, if they had gathered to play a game of poker instead

4

of to put together coke, or whatever they were doing?

5

Would that have made a difference?

6

MR. BACKSTROM:

I do not believe it would, Your

7

Honor.

8

analysis to these types of issues, you have to look at a

9

wide variety of factors such as their ability to control

When you apply a totality of the circumstances

10

access, the frequency of their visits, how long they

11

stayed on a particular occasion.

12

QUESTION:

But you wouldn't know about whether

13

they were there for a lawful purpose before you began this

14

search, so it can't turn on the -- can we take that out of

15

it, whether they're there to play poker or whether they're

16

there to prepare drugs?

17

MR. BACKSTROM:

No, I do not believe you can,

18

Your Honor.

19

police officer's never going to know what the person's

20

connection with the premises is at the time he conducts

21

his observations, but the nature of the conduct that's

22

involved I think is a factor to be considered.

23

It's not the -- you know, obviously the

It's a factor to be considered as it relates

24

back to their connection of the individual to the premises

25

themselves, but we believe that as it relates back, as it

relates to the type of activity that's normally associated

2

with the privacy of a dwelling, then that nature of the --

3

the nature of the activity may be a factor to be

4

considered,

but we believe --

QUESTION:

5

What you're saying, aren't you, is

6

that whenever there is a need to invoke a Fourth Amendment

7

protection this factor is going to count against the deed?
I mean, the only time people raise the Fourth

8

Amendment is when somebody is about to introduce something
10

into evidence in a criminal trial, and I think you're

11

saying that this factor always counts against them when

12

they want to do the very thing that the law allows them to

13

do by filing a suppression motion.

14

MR. BACKSTROM:

Well, Your Honor, I believe what

15

I'm saying is the nature of the activity involved is a

16

factor to be considered under a totality test.

17

QUESTION:

So I mean, the tendency of what

18

you're saying is that criminals should not have a right to

1

raise Fourth Amendment issues under a totality test.

20

that --

21
22

23

MR. BACKSTROM:

Is

No, that is not what I'm saying,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

Then tell me how the criminal nature

24

of the activity properly counts if that is not the

25

tendency of what you're arguing.

MR. BACKSTROM:

1

Criminal activity is obviously

2

not the type of conduct that's normally associated with

3

the privacy of a dwelling.

4

criminal in nature should provide no benefit, is what

5

we're arguing, to the totality analysis, whereas if

6

there's -QUESTION:

7

The fact that the activity is

Oh, I thought you were arguing that

8

it should provide a burden, as it were, in the test.

9

You're not arguing that at all.

10

MR. BACKSTROM:

No, we're not, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

12

QUESTION:

Was there any testimony at all from

13

the defendant in this case as to how long he had been

14

there?

15

is it not?

As I recall, the record is simply silent on that,

MR. BACKSTROM:

16

The record is silent, Your

17

Honor.

18

regarding those issues, and it is the defendant's burden

19

of proof.

20

There was no testimony offered by the defendants

QUESTION:

Yes, I would think so, that if he's

21

claiming a violation of the Fourth Amendment he's got to

22

show that it was his rights that were infringed.

23

QUESTION:

The States have applied various

24

standards in courts to determine whether there's a Fourth

25

Amendment violation with regard to a visitor in a home

1

and, as I look at the cases, they seem to turn quite often

2

on the extent to which the visitor has control over the

3

premises.
A visitor who's been given a key and the right

4
5

to exclude others would be treated much like the

6

homeowner, but someone with a more casual contact would

7

not.
I find the totality of the circumstances test

8

9
10

pretty vague.

Do you place any reliance on the control

test that's used by some of the State courts?
MR. BACKSTROM:

11

Yes, Your Honor.

I believe that

12

the ability to control access is a factor to be

13

considered, and again, there are -- these different

14

factors may have different weight in the analysis under

15

the totality test, but this Court has used a totality of

16

the circumstances test a long time for purposes of Fourth

17

Amendment analysis, not just in issues relating to

18

standing, but in issues relating to the voluntariness of a

19

search, whether or not there's enough probable cause to

20

obtain a search warrant --

QUESTION:

6

Mr. Backstrom, you said a moment ago

7

at the beginning of your argument that the position below

8

was tantamount to the readoption of the automatic standing

9

rule, and I'm wondering if it is.
Isn't there a distinction to be drawn between

10
11

this notion of common enterprise that there would be

12

standing when the stranger, when the guest or invitee is

13

engaged in some kind of a common activity with the owner

of the dwelling on the one hand and on the other hand the

Can't a line be drawn there, and if a line can

18
19

be drawn,

isn't the rule below something short of

20

reestablishing automatic standing?

21

MR. BACKSTROM:

Well, we do believe the rule

22

below, Your Honor, would establish the automatic standing

23

legitimately on the premises, because we believe that the

24

near engagement in a common task with a resident or a

25

property possessor is basically tantamount to establishing

that.

It's nothing more than -QUESTION:

2

What about a line I suggested?

3

There's something -- like all lines, there are going to be

4

times when you're going to have difficulty drawing it, but

5

there is, it seems to me, something intuitively different

6

about three people sitting around a table, in this case

7

packaging cocaine, and on the other hand the individual

who comes in to fix the telephone, who really is simply

to no greater sanctity than if it were carried on in a

2

store, a garage, or a car.
This court has addressed similar issues.

3

In

4

that case it was an unlawful business, as it is here,

5

and - -

6

QUESTION:

Well, are you then saying the reason

7

is that it was business, whereas if it had been a criminal

8

enterprise not for profit, you would admit the

9

distinction, the line that I was suggesting?

10

Is it that the line cannot be drawn, or that you

11

shouldn't draw it in a business case as opposed to a

12

nonbusiness enterprise, or a nonbusiness activity?

13

is the reason for your answer?

14

MR. BACKSTROM:

Which

Well, Your Honor, I believe what

15

we're arguing here is that the business differential, the

16

business versus a social guest is a line to be drawn, and

17

an important one, but that's not to say that business

18

visitors don't have the rights of privacy --

19

QUESTION:

criminal enterprises?

21

(Laughter.)

Do you know of many nonprofit

22

MR. BACKSTROM:

23

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

What is the difference, as you see

24

it, between your brief and the Government's brief that

25

supports you here?

MR. BACKSTROM:

1

There is no dramatic difference

2

between our two briefs, Your Honor.

We would agree that

3

most temporary guests, as the Solicitor has put forth in

4

their brief, would not have a legitimate expectation of

5

privacy in the premises.
However, we believe that under certain

6

7

circumstances a short term guest may have those

8

connections, if they've been a frequent visitor, had

9

ability to control access, and so forth.
QUESTION:

10
11

A poker player that doesn't have the

key but comes every week to play the game?
MR. BACKSTROM:

12

Well, again, I think that is a

13

factor to be considered, Your Honor, the frequency of

14

visits, what's the nature of their connection --

QUESTION:

I've given you the case, so what is

16

it?

with their connection to that particular residence.

There are --

12

QUESTION:

Yes, but how about that factor?

13

MR. BACKSTROM:

14

additional information that might render their connection

with the premises more significant than the first time

QUESTION:

I understand the factual difference,

but I don't know why it should make a difference.
If in each case the individual is invited by the

owner to engage -- I guess in this instance I'm sure it's

a lawful activity.

whether they play once a week, or three or four or five

2

times a week?
MR. BACKSTROM:

3

Well, Your Honor, we're just --

4

we're suggesting that under totality of the circumstances

5

test you have to look at all of those factors.
QUESTION:

6

I know you're saying I have to look

7

at it, but what I'm saying, why should that distinction be

8

a potential source of difference?

9

MR. BACKSTROM:

That distinction by itself may

10

not be, but if you add that to some of the other factors,

11

such as whether they have an ongoing intimate relationship

12

with the person that they're involved in playing this --

13

QUESTION:

I play poker once a week.

It seems

14

to me I've got a pretty strong personal relationship with

15

somebody.

16

MR. BACKSTROM:

Well, that in itself may not be

17

enough to give you a significant enough connection to a

18

residence other than your own for purposes of establishing

19

whether you have an expectation of privacy that society's

20

willing to accept as being reasonable.

21

QUESTION:

What are we driving towards with

22

these tests?

In my own mind, perhaps wrongly, I've used

23

the Spanish expression, mi casa e su casa --my house is

24

yours -- and insofar as that's the attitude, there's the

25

expectation of privacy, and insofar as it's not, there

1

isn't, and is that what these cases seem to be driving

2

towards?
When we invite a weekend guest, that's what we

3
4

say, my house is yours, but we certainly don't say that

5

with a business visitor normally, and perhaps with a poker

6

player it depends on the nature of the game, but is that

7

what this is driving towards?

MR. BACKSTROM:

Yes, I believe -- this Court has

2

obviously indicated that in Minnesota v. Olson, and we

3

believe that's the outer standard for purposes of

4

establishing a legitimate expectation of privacy.

5

On the other hand, one certainly has to be

Well, certainly when you say guest it

there by some sort of subterfuge.

MR. BACKSTROM:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, it seems to me that what you're

13

suggesting is what we might call a multifactor test, and

14

it may be almost impossible to avoid it, but that the

15

Government tries to reach a higher level of generality and

say that there is just no legitimate expectation of

17

privacy by a social or business guest in a home, other

18

than an overnight visitor.

20
21

I guess that's it, I think there's a difference
between the two of you in that respect.
Now, maybe on analysis we're going to have to

ask the Government, well, how do you know it's not

legitimate, and then they'll give us all these factors,

MR. BACKSTROM:

I agree, Your Honor, and what

we're asking the Court to establish in this case under

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Respondents did not suffer a violation of their

1

The questions we ask would be the questions this

2

Court asked in Olson, which is, is this person effectively

3

the functional equivalent of a member of the household,

4

such that they would exercise some element of control,

5

perhaps in the host's absence?

6

Is this person someone who's expected to conduct

7

their intimate or private affairs in the home such that

8

society accords them a privileged sense of privacy there?

9

Does this person fall within a social tradition

10

under which the host would be expected to defer to the

11

visitor's privacy interests?

12

For an overnight guest, those factors all point

13

that this person is functionally a member of that

household.

Does frequency of visitation enter

into that balance?

believe it would be dispositive.

and the window.

Why?

The bushes are

Why is that?

I mean, I thought

7

you had a fairly good case until I looked at two exhibits.

8

Once I looked at Exhibit 10 which is the same as

9

Exhibit 9, I take it, it is just taken from a different

10

angle, and then I looked at Exhibit 8 -- and I'm asking

11

you this.

12

than I am -- I thought, well, this is just a basement

13

apartment.

14

I'm not -- I'm going to sound more definite

I mean -- I lived in a basement apartment once.

15

Our kitchen's still sort of underwater -- and when I'm

16

there, I know that if you don't pull the blinds the right

17

way, everybody can walk in and look, so when I'm in the

18

kitchen when I used to live in that basement apartment, I

19

assumed I had to pull the blinds.

20

Now, it's true that in my -- on my basement

21

apartment was about 2 feet away from the sidewalk, but I

22

thought people used to wander by.

23

Now, I look at this, it looks about the same to

24

me, particularly is a bicycle behind these bushes.

So why wouldn't you expect, if you live in that

apartment, that somebody might walk by, and you'd better

wrong way anybody can see in.
MR. COLBERT:

7
8

I think the bushes will protect

you from looking into these windows.
QUESTION:

9

How do they in Exhibit 10 protect me?

10

Suppose I start here on the left, and I simply walk over

11

one window, two windows, three windows, there I am.

12

never went to any bushes.
I mean, I grant you I could go through the

13
14

bushes, or I might not go through the bushes.

15

MR. COLBERT:

But in this case these officers

16

went over the bushes, which is what the Minnesota supreme

17

court found, crawled over the bushes to get to these

18

windows, and so I think it's clear that these bushes were

19

protected -- were put there so you would not walk by these

20

windows.

21

QUESTION:

Well, if you look at Exhibit 12, I-

22

23

anybody could walk right up.

Mr. Lamken, Justice Kennedy asked Mr.

What's your answer to that?

It's a two-step analysis.

3

What is your position on what is a good,

legitimate conduct for the police officer who wants to

MR. COLBERT:

Where do you draw the line?

The bottom line is, when looking

into a home, any kind of intrusion into a home, unless

8

there are exigent circumstances there should be a warrant,

9

especially when you have to go through the contortions

10

that this officer had to go through to intrude upon the

11

privacy of the home, so that is this Court's bottom line,

12

and that is what is at the core of the Fourth Amendment.

QUESTION:

So what about -- does it make any

14

difference whether it's somebody who's there as a

factors in this case would show that he had an expectation

That's correct, Your Honor.

So really what we're getting at is

23

not whether there's an expectation of privacy, but whether

24

it is the sort of an expectation of privacy that society

25

is willing to recognize as reasonable, which leaves it up

In this case, one important factor is that they were

Another important factor --

QUESTION:

What burden is that?

I mean, again,

to you to establish that they were more than that, not up

to the State to prove that they weren't.

to protect that person's privacy, the one who owns the

That's his castle.

But why do we want to protect the privacy of the

MR. COLBERT:

QUESTION:

9

MR. COLBERT:

For two reasons.

Yes.
First, as the host, I want to

10

share my privacy with my guests.

11

for a dinner party, be it for 2 hours, I want to share my

12

privacy with them.

13

upon my house while I'm having a dinner party, it would

14

not just be offensive to me, it would be offensive to the

15

people I invited over, so I don't think it -- it's not

16

necessary that it be an overnight to be -- to share the

privacy.

4

that should change.

5

There's no expectation of privacy when the Avon lady comes

in.

7

I just don't understand why

This is a commercial transaction.

MR. COLBERT:

She -- if they've evidenced no

8

subjective expectation of privacy, but if I'm coming over

9

to discuss life insurance, or some other business activity

10

that may be an intimate activity, that's a different

11

matter.

12

You might want to have privacy.

In that case you might want to close the blinds.

13

And that's why it's important in this case that

14

the defendants exhibited an expectation of privacy.

wasn't -- they tried to shield their privacy from

everyone.

Mr. Colbert, I was just glancing

QUESTION:

It was not relied on, then, by the

supreme court of Minnesota?

4

MR. COLBERT:

No, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Colbert --

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Colbert, I am thinking of another

7

reason.

You haven't given it yet, and it may not be

8

sound, but I'd be interested in your thoughts on it, and
maybe Mr. Backstrom could comment when he gets back up.

10

One reason you might want to afford the guests

11

the standing to contest here is not merely because -- and

12

as a reason for finding that reasonable, is not merely

13

because the host wants to share the host's privacy, but

14

because the host wants to preserve the host's own privacy.

15

And it's quite true that the host in this

16

situation will have standing to contest the search, or the

17

intrusion if there is one, but the breach of privacy, if

18

there has been one, will have been complete, whether the

1

host can contest it later or not, and it might very well

20

be that we would want to give standing to the guest in

21

order to avoid, as it were, tempting the police to come in

22

and make searches which will necessarily violate the

23

privacy of the owner.

24
25

Is that a sound reason?

You haven't given it,

and maybe there's a reason for not getting into that.

MR. COLBERT:

1

That is a sound reason, Your

2

Honor, and it's, I think because they're working together

3

makes it even more sound.
QUESTION:

4

Well, if that's a sound reason, then

5

you pick up the pizza delivery man and the Avon lady --

6

you pick up everybody.
QUESTION:

7
8

Does that take you back to automatic

standing of Jones?
MR. COLBERT:

9

No, it doesn't, and I go back to

10

the issue of having exhibited a subjective expectation of

11

privacy.
There may be some circumstances where you invite

12

13

the pizza man in, where it's important that you have some

14

private interaction --

15

QUESTION:

Why is that important?

If your

16

object is what Justice Souter says, to reinforce the

17

privacy expectations of the owner, you ought to let

anybody reinforce it, the pizza man, the Avon lady -- who

cares whether they have an expectation of privacy.

Yes.

We believe -- the record's

In reference to Justice Souter's question, we do

not believe the -- there would be any tempting of the
