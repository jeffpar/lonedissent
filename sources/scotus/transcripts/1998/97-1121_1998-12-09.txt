ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE ROSENTHAL

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
As the record before the Chicago City Council

12

makes plain, gang crime is different from most other forms

13

of criminal activity.

14

commit their crimes in broad daylight, in full view of

15

law-abiding citizens, and on the public way.

16

gang crime.

17

Most criminals, of course, do not

Not so with

Street gangs rely on their ability to so

18

terrorize their neighborhoods that they may commit crimes

19

with impunity while law-abiding persons are afraid to

20

cooperate with the police, indeed, afraid to even use the

21

public spaces in their own neighborhoods.

22

present, however, all they see is gang members pretending

23

to innocently loiter.

24
25

When police are

On that record, the city council enacted the
gang loitering ordinance.

It provides that whenever a

police officer sees a group of loiterers in a public place

2

and reasonably believes a member of a criminal street gang

3

to be present, he may order the group to disperse.

4

This morning, I will discuss the two holdings

5

below and explain why this ordinance is neither

6

impermissibly vague nor inconsistent with principles of

7

substantive due process.

11

QUESTION:

Just one question.

Do the police

have special training and instructions to know who members
of the gangs are?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

The general order that govern

12

enforcement, 92-4 -- it is in the petition appendix --

13

contains quite explicit instructions and demanding

14

standards for making determinations of gang membership

15

and, of course, even respondents do not challenge --

16
17
18

QUESTION:

And it takes some experience and

expertise to know this?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

It does.

For example, under the

19

order, not all police officers are permitted to enforce

20

this ordinance, only gang specialists, tactical officers,

21

and other specially designated personnel familiar with the

22

gang files of the Chicago Police Department are permitted

23

to make arrests under the ordinance.

24
25

QUESTION:

Well then, how does the person who's

not a member of the gang know that he is doing something

unlawful?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

2

Well, interestingly, Justice

3

Kennedy, the critical point here is that, on the question

4

of fair notice, as Your Honor's question points out, it is

5

not unlawful to loiter in the City of Chicago.

6

loiters with a gang member one is not breaking the law.

7

When one

Under this ordinance, it is a crime only, after

8

having received an order to disperse, to fail to obey that

9

order, order -QUESTION:

10

Does the police tell the person who

11

is not a gang member, this is a gang member and therefore

12

you must disperse?

13
14

Does he say that?

MR. ROSENTHAL:

The ordinance does not provide

for that?

15

QUESTION:

Well, how does the person know?

16

does the nongang-member know that the other person's a

17

gang member?

18

MR. ROSENTHAL:

How

Well, what the person has --

19

what the police are told, what the police do is, they give

20

an order in terms of common parlance to disperse.

21

provides fair notice of what the constitution requires,

22

how to conform one's conduct with the requirement of the

23

law.

That

24

Of course, individuals ordinarily ought to

25

presume that when police issue orders they do so for

not.

Well, regardless of whether one wants

to test it or not, if the police do not have the predicate
for the order the individual doesn't have to move.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

11

Well, the traffic laws provide a

12

good example.

13

go down a street, we know of no principle of

14

constitutional law that says the police officer must

15

explain why that street has been closed and that there is

16

sufficient ordinance authority.

When a police officer refuses to let cars

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenthal, are you saying, then,

18

that if the law -- simply read, it would be much easier if

19

a police officer gives you a command to disperse and you

20

don't obey you've committed an offense.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

21

Justice Ginsburg, we think that

22

that is what this law reads for purposes of fair notice.

We think it would supply fair

There might be other problems with an ordinance.
QUESTION:

What other problems?

If it simply

5

said, the police ordered you to disperse, you disperse,

6

otherwise you've committed an offense --

7

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, that ordinance is so broad

8

it might reach picketing demonstrations, activity

9

protected by the First Amendment.
What people are told on a point of fair notice

10
11

is what they must do, disperse.
Now, there are other standards for enforcement

12

13

under the ordinance.

14

QUESTION:

Suppose the hypothetical were changed

15

so that it says, the police give you a lawful order to

You think that would be okay.

of fair notice.

2

their enforcement discretion has been circumscribed or

3

not.
QUESTION:

4
5

There might be other issues about whether

Suppose the police had secret

guidelines for when they give you the order to disperse.

6

MR. ROSENTHAL:

QUESTION:

11
12

If those guide --

But they were -- no one else knew

them.
MR. ROSENTHAL:
QUESTION:

Well --

Would you have to assume that the

order's valid?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

I think on a facial challenge,

13

one could bring a facial challenge to such an ordinance

14

and if the police refused to disclose the guidelines, the

15

court obviously could compel disclosure of the guidelines

16

and if the guidelines were not on principle then there

17

might be a basis.

18
19

The FBI, for example, has all kinds of rules
that they don't necessarily disclose to the public.

20

Our point is, it is important not to conflate

21

the issue of fair notice and standards for enforcement.

22

When people are told to move on, they are given notice of

23

what the law requires them to do.

24
25

QUESTION:
we keep raising.

That --

I think that comes back to the point

They are given notice of the fact that

1

the police officer has concluded that, but the question

2

that is bothering some of us is, on what basis can they

3

come to a conclusion that they have, in fact, violated the

4

ordinance.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

5
6

We know of no principle of

constitutional law --

7

QUESTION:

Strike that.

I've misspoken.

On

8

what basis can they come to a conclusion that the police

9

officer has the necessary predicate to give them the

10

order?

That's what's bothering us.
MR. ROSENTHAL:

11

The city --we start with the

12

ordinance.

13

public record which grants to the police the authority

14

under these specified circumstances when a member of a

15

criminal street gang is present, to issue the order.

16
17

The public, of course, has notice of the
authority that is conferred on the police.

18
19

The city council passed an ordinance, it's

QUESTION:

When he tells them to disperse, does

he tell them why?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

20

Under the ordinance, people are

21

only told to disperse, and again, we know of no principle

22

of constitutional law that entitles one to be given a

23

reason.

Washington because the President is about to walk by, we

know of no rule that says they have to explain to people

the reason you need to move is that the President is

QUESTION:

to me that's not the problem.

6

individual has notice of the standard of conduct to which

7

he must conform, or to which he can refer when he decides

8

whether the police officer is worthy of obedience legally

9

in making the order that he makes, and that's -- that's --

Well, I can accept that, but it seems
The problem is whether the

14

defined, is another.

15

Identification of the conduct of loitering, so

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, Justice Souter, as the

16

Illinois supreme court acknowledged, as a matter of

17

ordinance construction, the term loiter has a common and

18

accepted meaning.

19

definitions of the term loiter, and it acknowledged --

absence of an apparent purpose, right?

That is the definition of the

In addition --

QUESTION:

Well, don't most -- I mean, it - - I

have difficulty with that, because it seems to me that

1

there usually is an apparent purpose for most of what we

2

call loitering.

3

Some people, for example, with nothing better to

4

do like to sit and -- or stand and watch the cars go by.

5

That's a purpose, it seems to me that under this

6

ordinance, the problem is not that there is no apparent

7

purpose but that the ordinance necessarily is making some

8

silent assumptions that some purposes are worthy and some

9

are not, and it's difficult, I would think, for a person,

10

particularly for a non gang member, to stick with Justice

11

Kennedy's first question, to know in advance what purpose

12

is, in fact, going to be an acceptable one under the

13

ordinance or to the police.

14

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, the ordinance -- what is

15

critical under the ordinance is if an individual's purpose

16

for remaining in any one place is apparent.

17

officer cannot tell --

18

QUESTION:

Is what?

19

QUESTION:

Apparent?

20

MR. ROSENTHAL:

If the

If the person's purpose for

21

remaining in any one place is apparent, if the officer

22

does not know if the reason the individual is standing

23

still, the group are standing still, is they're enjoying

24

the night air, or they're going to resume dealing drugs

25

from their specified location as soon as the officer

1

leaves, the purpose for remaining still, for standing

2

still is not purpose, is not apparent.
But Justice Souter, I think what's even more

3
4

critical is, is to consider the premise whether people are

5

doing anything wrong when they're loitering under this

6

ordinance.

7

One of the premises for this regulation is that

8

the nongang member is at risk when he is standing still at

9

public.

When people know they're with gang members, at

10

least you can say that they're assuming the risks that

11

adhere in standing still with someone who is --

12

QUESTION:

Well, I think you have to assume that

13

the ordinance is broad enough that some people would not

14

know they happen to have a gang member present.

15

maybe some would, maybe some wouldn't.

16

I mean,

Has any attempt been made in any other city

17

ordinance to focus on some action by the so-called gang,

18

intimidation of people, or seeking to obtain physical

19

control of an area for some illicit purpose?

20

I mean, if it were something like that in the

21

ordinance, then it seems to me people would understand if

22

they engaged in activity like that --

Justice O'Connor --

Yes.
Justice O'Connor, Illinois has
One should not underestimate,

The only way to bring an intimidation case when

the police are not present is to put oneself in harm's way

11

by offering to be a witness.

ordinance is that people call the police and, instead of

13

being told, sorry, unless you're willing to testify

14

there's nothing I can do for you, they see visible

15

results.

16

The great virtue of this

The loiterers are dispersed, and not only does

that inhibit crime and violence, but it also energizes the

I suppose, Mr. Rosenthal, the streets

MR. ROSENTHAL:

constitutionality of such a statute that said, anyone who

2

loiters and is told to move on commits an offense?
MR. ROSENTHAL:

3

Well, and on the question of

4

vagueness, I don't mean to say the end justifies the

5

means.

6

aside, there is one unquestionably objective standard for

7

enforcement.

8

question that's objective.

9

loitering is, enforcement is delimited to people who

10

What I do mean to say is, even putting loitering

First, people need to be standing still.

No

Even if one doesn't know what

aren't walking.
Second, enforcement is limited when there is a

11
12

reasonable belief that a member of a criminal street gang

13

is present, and always there, even if another individual

14

doesn't realize he's next to a gang member.
QUESTION:

15

So it isn't really loitering.

It's

16

prohibited -- it's loitering with a member of a street

17

gang.

18

MR. ROSENTHAL:

19

QUESTION:

That's correct.

There is --

Let's just take loitering.

I guess,

20

what I gather from your response to Justice Ginsburg, that

21

you concede that loitering is a constitutionally protected

22

right?

23
24
25

MR. ROSENTHAL:

We do -- we find nothing in the

Constitution that protects the right to loiter.
QUESTION:

QUESTION:

11

Why is loitering above smoking

We see no constitutional

Much less loitering with a member of

MR. ROSENTHAL:

And absolutely no right to join

16

QUESTION:

This isn't the Court's first

17

encounter with a loitering statute, and there are cases

18

like Papachristou, where the Court found, at least those

19

statutes were problematic because of the discretion given

20

to the officers.

21

MR. ROSENTHAL:

Well, and of course Papachristou

22

was a drag net.

23

anyone outdoors at night could be arrested.

1

Ginsburg made.

2

that what we're really concerned about in Kolender was

3

that the police have -- there are no standards to guide

4

the police for when it's going to enforce the order.

5

I think the Court was very careful to say

MR. ROSENTHAL:

What I think is so interesting

6

about Justice O'Connor's opinion in Kolender is, loitering

7

was an element of that offense.

8

the Court identified any problem with using loitering as a

9

member of the offense.

Not a single member of

Justice Brennan even wrote

10

separately, because he thought there was an additional

11

constitutional infirmity.

12

QUESTION:

But the opinion says the important

13

thing is that there be minimal guidelines to those who

14

enforce the ordinance.

15

MR. ROSENTHAL:

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's correct, and --

And it seems to me we can't affirm,

17

or rule in your favor unless we modify that, or somehow

18

confine it.

19

MR. ROSENTHAL:

I quite agree there must be

20

minimal guidelines, although Kolender hypothesized a law

21

with loitering as an element that would be constitutional

22

and didn't identify loitering as the invalid element in

23

that statute.

24
25

fatally imprecise, enforcement is delimited only to a

the only

affirmative defense in this ordinance is that you

weren't -- that somebody wasn't a gang member.

with was not a gang member, an impossible burden.

the position if you were defending someone that the

I suppose that if you

definition of loitering, no apparent purpose, but

13

you're -- you have two major changes.

members, so if there are, say, five or more gang members

But once the court of appeals construed it as

being a congregation which posed a threat to safety, at

that point in time it required an individualized

determination on the street, and if that kind of an

You disagree that it was treated as a

Court, and is this case a First Amendment case?
MR. GROSSMAN:

I agree that the Court considered

it problematic without too much definition, and that it

must have been concerned about First Amendment rights, but

14

I don't think that First Amendment rights are not present

in this case.

The city itself has indicated that there is a

MR. GROSSMAN:

9

Well, Your Honor, this is a

10

regulation of the public street and in Kolender, the last

11

time this Court saw a pure loitering ordinance, it said

12

that it implicated freedom of movement, and that it had

13

the potential to arbitrarily suppress First Amendment

14

freedom.

15

The same is true of Shuttlesworth, the same was

true in Thornhill, and there isn't a case that this Court

17

has looked at in the last 60 years which deals with street

MR. GROSSMAN:

Because when you are attempting

to regulate the street there are a multitude of interests

14

and activities which the citizen possesses.

15

16

in.

There are a

And so when this Court has approved efforts to

18

regulate the sidewalk, and notwithstanding concerns that

19

hanging out is not communicative activity, this definition

20

of no apparent purpose embraces and includes communicative

21

activity, the Court has required individualized

22

determinations of wrongdoing.

For example,

in Grayned, when this Court looked

24

at an antinoise ordinance in close proximity to a school,

it approved it as opposed to a general breach of the peace

simply provides that whenever, let's say, five or more

individuals reasonably suspected of being gang members are

seen standing and not moving on a public street, they may

be ordered to disperse, the justification legislatively

is to that?
MR. GROSSMAN:

The answer to that, Your Honor --

12

and we have not gotten into that fray, but the answer to

that, Your Honor, is that eight African American aldermen

14

opposed the ordinance, and six voted in favor.

15

QUESTION:

What about the assertion in the

16

petitioner's brief that in the last year in which the

17

ordinance was enforced, gang-related homicides dropped 26

18

percent, a considerable -- considerably steeper decline

19

than the 9 percent drop in the overall homicide rate, and

20

that in the first year in which the ordinance was not

21

enforced because it was enjoined, although the overall

22

homicide rate fell another 4 percent, the level of gang-

23

related homicide increased 7 percent.

24

Do you contest those figures?

25

MR. GROSSMAN:

I would agree with those figures,

1

and then I would add one for clarity, and that is, in

2

1997, after the ordinance was no longer in effect for 2

3

years, that gang-related homicides dropped 19 percent to a

4

figure of 183, and while those are significant, each and

5

every murder, of course, is significant, that in 1993,

6

when this whole process started, there were 223 gang-

related homicides so gant-related homicides have decreased

8

over the last 5 years, and they are down to 183 in the

city.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROSENTHAL:

14

United States Attorney's Office

15

for the Northern District of Illinois estimates there are

16

100,000 gang members in the City of Chicago.
Mr. Grossman says we must use laws that require

individualized determinations.

19

of those laws to satisfactorily address the problem that

20

led to the enactment of this ordinance and, indeed, gang

crime has been rising since the ordinance was no longer in

effect in '97.

40 percent this year in the City of Chicago without this

2

ordinance.
What does that tell us?

3

Well, on the vagueness

4

prong -- there are two prongs, of course, to vagueness

5

inquiry.
Fair notice.

6

Mr. Grossman doesn't really

7

address that, because no criminal sanctions are available

8

under this ordinance for loitering alone.

9

sanctions come into play only after an officer

Criminal

10

specifically informs an individual that he has loitered in

11

that officer's -- the officer's determined he's loitered

12

with a gang member in a public place and is subject to an

13

order to disperse.
Mr. Grossman therefore focuses on the second

prong.

The second prong the Court describes as minimal

standards.

whatever the imprecisions in loitering, even if this

MR. ROSENTHAL:

By ordering everyone to move on,

11

it is far simpler, rather than sorting through a crowd and

telling each individual who must stay and who -- who may

13
