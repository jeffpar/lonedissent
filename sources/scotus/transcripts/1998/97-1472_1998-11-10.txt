ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. STEBBINS:

11
12

the Michael A. Haddle v. Jeanette

We're going to have to move along.

6
7

We'll hear argument

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about whether there is any Federal

13
14

civil remedy for a Federal witness in the position of my

15

client who was fired from his job of 10 years'

16

because he responded to a Federal subpoena, appeared at a

17

Federal grand jury proceeding, prepared to testify as to

18

facts involving a Federal health care fraud investigation.
QUESTION:

19

standing

Would you clarify for us what the

20

status of Georgia law is on the subject of recoverability

21

for at-will employment discharge?

22

MR. STEBBINS:

Yes, Your Honor.

Under Georgia

23

law, as stated in the leading Supreme Court case of

24

Georgia Power Company v. Busbin, which is cited in the

25

brief,

there is a cause of action for tortious

interference with at-will employment which can be brought

2

by the at-will employee for damages against any person

3

other than his employer and those who share the immunity

4

of the employer under State law.
QUESTION:

6

Now, there was a supplemental brief

calling the Court's attention to some new case.
MR. STEBBINS:

7

Yes, Your Honor.

It's my view

8

that that case doesn't illuminate anything about this case

9

whatsoever.

I'm surprised that it was cited.

In that case, the Robbins decision -- Georgia

10
11

has a strong at-will policy that the employer can never be

12

liable for discharging his at-will employee.

13

Robbins case, the employee contended that because he was

14

an employee of a Federal credit union, he had a Federal

15

statutory right to notice and hearing before he was

16

discharged.

17

employee of a Federal credit union is not an employee of a

18

Federal agency and has no statutory Federal right to

19

anything more than any other at-will employee.

20

does not change Georgia law in any respect as to that

21

issue.

In the

The Georgia Supreme Court found that an

1

Georgia law, the action is characterized as an injury to

2

property.

3

jurisdictions, as I pointed out in the brief, some

4

jurisdictions characterize this as an injury to the

5

person, others as an injury to property.

6

is that all jurisdictions characterize it as either an

7

injury to person or property, thereby falling within the

8

language that Congress used when it gave a - - a Federal

recovery under this Federal tort that Congress created for

QUESTION:

11

So, if the injury were purely an

12

emotional injury as a result of what happened, would that

13

be recoverable in your view?
MR. STEBBINS:

14

Under the Federal statute, Your

15

Honor, I'm not sure whether it would be or not.

16

the answer to that question would be the same answer that

17

would be given if this were a case premised on Title 7 or

18

section 1981 or section 1982 or any other Federal law that

19

provides for liability for discrimination in employment of

20

some kind.

often recognized, against the background of general tort

law.

in this situation, but that, as you say, other States

would all give relief.

Suppose Georgia alone would give

MR. STEBBINS:

5

Well, I believe, Your Honor, that

a Federal tort created by Congress should be governed by a

uniform Federal rule of damages.

But under the Fourteenth Amendment,

generally we look to State law for the definition of

property.

15

MR. STEBBINS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

Your Honor, I agree --

And why should we not do the same

here?
MR. STEBBINS:

Because this section of 1985 is

not premised on the Fourteenth Amendment and, in fact, has

MR. STEBBINS:

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.

I mean, a particular property is

damaged by -- by the miscreant under this statute.

5

you know,

6

You say we adopt a Federal rule?

7

MR. STEBBINS:

And,

the threshold question is, whose property is it?

No, Your Honor,

I don't say that.

8

I would first point out that the chances of such a case

9

arising are very small and they don't arise here --

10

QUESTION:

So, you acknowledge we look to the

11

State law for whose property it is, but then you want us

12

to create a general Federal law to - - as to whether there

13

has been a - - been a tort or not.

14

MR. STEBBINS:

Well, again, Your Honor,

I say

15

this, that when Congress uses the phrase,

16

person or property, when it used this phrase in 1871,

17

create a tort, not in the context of the Fourteenth

18

Amendment where we're talking about the adjustment of

19

authority between the State and Federal Government,

20

believe that the content that has to be given to the term,

21

injury to person or property,

22

got to be drawn from what you might say is the common

23

meaning of the terms.

And it would be my contention that although

there are difficulties with the idea that when Congress

MR. STEBBINS:

1

2

Your Honor.

When the act --

QUESTION:

3

Well, I don't know about that,

Most unlikely.

I mean, isn't there a

4

significant deterrent for the State to -- to modify its

5

-- its internal law just to spite the Federal Government?

6

MR. STEBBINS:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. STEBBINS:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

They're not going to do that.
That's true, but there's also a

very -- it's very unlikely in my opinion that the Federal

10

Government and the State government will disagree as to

11

what property means.
What's happened in this case is that the Federal

12

13

and State governments have disagreed as to who may have a

14

recovery -- rather, as to who may be liable for an

15

invasion of property.
QUESTION:

16

Well, in -- in order to get to that

17

issue, why do you look to tort law as such as opposed to

18

going directly to the statute and saying the purpose of

19

the statute seems to have been to protect people from

20

getting hurt for testifying?

21

that the statute must be - - must be referring to would be

22

anything that a witness or potential witness would regard

23

as enough of an injury to induce that witness not to

24

testify or to fear that he would be hurt if he did

25

testify.

And therefore the injury

And if you look at it that way, you don't look

1

2

to tort law as such, though tort law may be -- be helpful

3

in suggesting things to you, you -- you look to the way

4

witnesses are going to be motivated by what happens to

5

them.

6

which I suppose would clearly cover your case.

7

And if you do that, you have a concept of injury

So, my question is, why do you confine yourself

8

to tort law concepts, as helpful as they may be, as

9

opposed to going right to the object of the statute and

10

saying injury should be defined in terms of that

11

ostensible object?

12

MR. STEBBINS:

Your Honor, my only answer to

13

that is that I agree with Your Honor, and I didn't mean to

14

confine myself to --

15

QUESTION:

Oh, you do.

So, it doesn't have to

16

be person or property.

17

invent an object of the statute beyond the words?

18

it says you have to be injured in your person or property.

19

I mean, if someone says, if you testify, I am going to

20

break the -- break the knees of your -- of your son-in-

21

law, would that be covered by the statute?

22

all, it would fit the purpose of the statute, but are you

23

injured in your person or property?

24
25

MR. STEBBINS:

I mean, you -- you feel free to
I mean,

Because, after

I believe the son-in-law has been

injured, Your Honor, and I think he would have a claim.

QUESTION:

MR. STEBBINS:

15

some things that will deter people from testifying which

MR. STEBBINS:

Well,

It certainly

I think that the tort law

4

concepts have got to have some relevance to the inquiry

5

whether there has been a sufficient injury to person or

Mr. Stebbins, maybe I misread your

position, but I thought you were saying the statute could

just as well have said injured, any person who is injured,

But that in his person or property was an

11

endeavor to show the breadth of the statute rather than

12

the narrowness of it.
MR. STEBBINS:

13

That's correct, Your Honor, and I

14

tried to illustrate that by reference to mid-19th century

15

sources to indicate that that was the intention of

Congress.

something that would bother someone a great deal and

2

perhaps induce him not to testify, but is that injury in

3

the light of the statute?
MR. STEBBINS:

4

Your Honor, I would not think it

was, and this is why general tort law is relevant to the

6

determination of what the scope of injury to person or

property is.

restrictive.

QUESTION:

May I ask you about compensable?

If

we would go this far with you and say it's an injury, but

6

what would be the measure of compensation given that it

was an at-will employment and the employer could have

8

said, for any unpoisoned reason, go, I don't like you.

9

MR. STEBBINS:

Your Honor, again this same

10

question comes up, say, in a Title 7 case where this Court

11

has never spoken to that issue, and I believe there's a

12

difference of opinion among the circuits.

13

our circuit, the Eleventh Circuit, the Court generally

14

holds that the extent of compensation available will be

15

measured by what it states vaguely as a reasonable

16

standard.

1

assuming or asserting that -- that injury to person or

2

property means general -- general tort law, but you're

3

also assuming that it means general tort law as it may

4

evolve into the future.

5

Why do you assume that?

If -- if, for example, at-will employment was

6

not considered or any interference with at-will employment

7

was not considered to be a tort at the time this provision

8

was adopted, why -- why would I believe that the Congress

9

which enacted this would want that rather minor injury to

10

be sucked into the provision because some future states

11

give causes of action for interference with at-will

12

employment?

13
14
15

MR. STEBBINS:

Well, Your Honor, I have two

answers to that.
First of all, the most direct answer would be

16

that when Congress legislates in this broad manner and

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Petitioner was injured in his person or property

21

because he lost wages when he was fired pursuant to a

22

conspiracy prohibited by section 1985.

Well, should we look to State law to

determine whether there's injury to person or property?

3

MR. ROBERTS:

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor.

Why not?
Injury to person or property was a

6

term of art with a well-established meaning at common law.

7

It meant a loss or damage that was compensable in a tort

8

suit.

9

its legislative history warrants a departure from that

Nothing in the other provisions of section 1985 or

10

meaning and, indeed, the limited legislative history on

11

point confirms it.
In addition, there's no question that lost wages

12

13

were compensable in 1871 and that they remain so today.

14

An employee who loses his job because he's struck by a car

15

driven negligently can recover the wages he has lost, and

16

he can recover them whether or not his employment was at

17

will.

18

employment was terminated by a conspiracy prohibited by

19

section 1985, likewise has suffered a compensable injury.

The question is whether there's been a harm

QUESTION:

9

But isn't there also a question

10

whether someone who was incapable of committing the

11

substantive offense can be guilty of conspiracy to commit

MR. BRADLEY:

There are not many statutes that

use that precise phrase, injury to person or property.
I would like to take you, if I may, Justice

5

Scalia, to this particular statute and look at some of the

6

scenarios that arise if you construe injury to person or

property in this particular context to mean what the

petitioner and the Government --

QUESTION:

Before you do that, could you just

it from your answer to my question that you say the word

MR. BRADLEY:

2

First of all, Your Honor, I would

3

point out that there are modifying terms in the statute

4

that involve the use of force, intimidation, or threat

5

which suggest that you're talking about something other

6

than an inchoate interest such as property.
Number two, if you focus on what the concept of

7
8

employment at will was at the time this statute was

9

enacted, you must keep in mind that the -- that the

10

country was coming out of an era where the employment

11

relationship with the people primarily intended to be

12

protected by the statute was slavery, where the employee

13

was the property of the employer.
We then shifted into an era that's described by

14
15

H.G. Wood in the Law of Master & Servant back in 1877 of a

16

pure at-will employment, where the employer had the right

17

to employ, the employee had the right to work, but there

that was fine as well.
QUESTION:

2

Okay, but what's the answer to my

3

question?

Assuming that there is this sphere of genuine

4

harm to the witness or potential witness, why would

5

Congress want to have left that sphere totally uncovered

by the statute?
MR. BRADLEY:

7

Employment was not considered

something that was going to be injured because there was

the freedom to move both on the side of the employer and

10

on the side of the employee.
QUESTION:

But do you - - do you - - do you

It's the Government's remedy to

What remedy is there for a Mr. Haddle?

MR. BRADLEY:

Mr. -- Mr. Haddle could have

He can get it under both of them.

Under both?
Mr. Haddle's articulated reason

5

for not proceeding with the False Claims Act action in his

6

brief is that the particular company that was his employer

7

was in bankruptcy, but that doesn't mean that that

8

eliminates his right.

9

company in bankruptcy ended up generating far more dollars

And in fact, that particular

10

than anybody would have believed.

He simply elected not

11

to pursue the remedy that was available to him and to try

12

to concoct a remedy out of this old civil rights statute

13

which has never been used to protect employment at will.

14

The recent case that we filed with our

15

supplemental brief is Robbins v. Federal Credit Union, and

16

I do think it's an important case for those who may look

17

and say, we are looking to State law to determine whether

or not a property interest is involved.

was recently decided, you had an employee who was an

20

employee of a Federal credit union, initially took the

21

position that makes me a Federal employee and therefore I

22

am protected by various statutes, but asserted a cause of

action for wrongful termination and for tortious

24

interference under Georgia law.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES C. STEBBINS, III

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

MR. STEBBINS:

There was a substantial

16

impediment to Mr. Haddle bringing an action under the

17

False Claims Act, and it was that the company was in

18

bankruptcy.

19

however.

20

It was not a financial consideration,

I was there and made the decision.
The fact is that officially Mr. Haddle was

21

terminated by the United States trustee in bankruptcy.

22

This was a result of a conspiracy among these respondents,

23

none of whom were the employer, to feed false information

24

to the trustee in bankruptcy who was duped and tricked

25

into dismissing Mr. Haddle.

1

Now, I couldn't sue the trustee in bankruptcy.

2

He's a -- a well-respected member of the bar in Augusta,

3

and my investigation revealed that there was -- he had not

4

done anything wrong.

5

Mr. Haddle had no way to utilize the False Claims Act in

6

order to remedy this situation.

7

recovered a judgment, a verdict which is on appeal.

8

Haddle did not have that available.

He was completely innocent.

So,

Mr. O'Neal did and we
Mr.

And I would observe that the False Claims Act is

9
10

a relatively narrow provision and certainly would not

11

provide a suitable alternate remedy.

12

witnesses who have an at-will employment and are fired

13

because they have testified in Federal court have an

14

adequate remedy, civil remedy, under any statute that I'm

15

aware of is simply not the case.

16

just as widely as I possibly could to find somebody to

17

remedy this injury to Mr. Haddle, and there was no way to

18

do it.

19

To say that

I canvassed the statutes

This brings me to the second point I wanted to

20

make which is that none of the defendants in this case are

21

Mr. Haddle's employer, and under Georgia law, Mr. Haddle

22

had a valuable property right as to everyone other than

23

his employer which is protected by this act as well as by

24

Georgia law.

25

And I would refer in response to the question

that Justice Souter and Justice Rehnquist gave -- asked

2

the Government as to whether it makes a difference if only

3

the employer were the defendant.

4

I would refer to the last words of section 1985 which

5

provide that when there is a proscribed conspiracy,

6

injured party shall have an action against any one or more

of the conspirators.

legislative history, but it almost appears to me that this

language was put here to abrogate any immunity that the

That's not my case, but

I couldn't find anything in the

employer might have had at State law.

one of the reasons.
