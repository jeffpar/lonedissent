ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ENGLERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Bank of America lent 203 North LaSalle Street

11
12

Partnership $92 million.

The loan was secured by 15

13

floors of an office building in the Loop, in Chicago.

14

Outside of bankruptcy, the bank would have been entitled

15

to be repaid $93 million in January of 1995, or to

16

foreclose on the real estate.
In the bankruptcy proceeding that the Court is

17
18

reviewing today, the bank wac denied the right to

19

foreclose.

20

in January 1995 was converted into a right to receive $60

21

million worth, present value, of payments over a period

22

extending to the year 2005.

23

was left in the hands of 203 North LaSalle Street

24

Partnership, despite its default on the loan, in exchange

25

for a promise to contribute $4.1 million net present value

Its right to receive a $93 million repayment

Yeah.

QUESTION:

Right.

And -- and the -- the -- the

15

$50,000.
MR. ENGLERT:

16
17
18

The trade creditors had claims of

$90,000.
QUESTION:

All right, 90,000.

So why wouldn't

19

the major creditor just have paid them their $90,000?

20

I right, that if -- if your client had just said, I'll

21

write a check for $90,000, you get the money, at that

22

point you would have been the only one left.

23

MR. ENGLERT:

24

QUESTION:

25

Correct.

And then there would have been no

doubt they couldn't do this.

Suppose you -- they

would have thought -- if you were the only creditor left,

if there was only one class of creditor, because you had

And it was the plan that excluded

2

anyone other than the pre-petition equity holders from

3

having the option to buy equity in the reorganized debtor.
It's also the plan that gives the pre-petition

4
5

equity holders the equity interest in the reorganized

debtor on account of being pre-petition equity holders.

7

In other words, on account of their prior claim or

8

interest.

QUESTION:

Are you saying that if an equity

owner is ever to be allowed to contribute new value, that

11

that must be made available on the same terms and

12

conditions to all -- to the --to all persons?

13

MR. ENGLERT:

Not quite, Your Honor.

If they're

14

ever to be allowed to contribute new value over the

15

objections of a class of impaired creditors, then yes,

16

we -- our position is that the -- the opportunity to buy

17

the equity for new value must be distributed equally.

18

But the real-world way that new value plans get

confirmed all the time is through creditor consent.

We're dealing here with a

MR. ENGLERT:

You don't reach

29(b) unless

there is an objection by a class of creditors --

6

QUESTION:

But is it not also true that whenever

7

a cram-down is approved, some objector has been not paid

8

in full?

9
20

MR. ENGLERT:

That's also correct, Your Honor,

yes.

21

QUESTION:

Okay.

22

MR. ENGLERT:

But the absolute priority rule

23

says that you go in absolute priority, that you see if the

24

people who are not being paid in full are more senior than

25

junior people who are receiving or retaining property.

1

And if they are, the plan violates the absolute priority

2

rule.

3

QUESTION:

So there could never be a cram-down

4

unless equity owners and non-equity owners are treated on

5

an equal basis so far as new value participation?
MR. ENGLERT:

6

Yes, Your Honor.

Because,

7

otherwise, the equity owners are receiving something on

8

account of their junior claim or interest.

9

exactly what 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) prohibits.

Which is

Now, it's our position that the statutory

10

11

language is dispositive here.

12

is also legislative history is also extremely helpful to

13

the bank.

But the legislative history

Before you get to the legislative

15

history, would you just answer -- make sure you've

MR. ENGLERT:

Would your position -- is your

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

And tell me what the difference is.
In a typical bankruptcy case,

22

especially involving a small business, the debtors'

23

pre-petition equity holders will often have lent money to

24

the business in the form of debt and not equity.

25

excise the phrase "on account of" from the statute, those

If we

1

people could not receive or retain anything on account of

2

their debt, as well as being unable to receive anything on

3

account of their --on account of their equity interest.

4

That would be a radically different world than

5

the world we have under Section

In

But if you -- if you deal only with

8

the cases where everybody is only a member of one class,

9

you say there are some people who are members both debtors

10

and equity holders.

11

MR. ENGLERT:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

But if everybody just was -- only fit

3

in one class and you don't have membership in more than

4

one class, then would the statute mean exactly the same

5

thing whether the words "on account of" were included or

6

deleted?

7

MR. ENGLERT:

No, it would not, Your Honor.

8

That raises the -- the questions of bidding for the

9

equity.

If the words "on account of" were deleted, the

20

debtor could not bid against the bank for the equity.

21

Because the words "on account of" are in there, if someone

22

wanted to hold an open auction for the equity in which

23

the -- the debtor bid, or the debtor's pre-petition equity

24

holders bid, and the bank bid as well, then whoever won

25

that auction would be receiving the equity on account of

1

having the highest bid and not on account of the

2

pre-petition equity interest.

3

That's why the words "on account of" have a role

4

to play in addition to their role of allowing people to be

5

paid on their debt claim.
QUESTION:

6

7

in which the equity position is not the highest bidder?
MR. ENGLERT:

9

So you're concerned only with cases

Well, here there was a one-horse

Can you elaborate a bit on this open

auction, which we don't even know whether this is already

the order, but you did answer the one-horse race, to say

23

no, of course there would be a two-horse race, and the

1

which you explained that, but --

2

MR. ENGLERT:

The bank wouldn't always have the

3

stronger horse, but the bank would always be in the race.

4

Because there is a point at which they could outbid us, on

5

the facts of this case.

6

could outbid us for the equity in this property.

7

our best interest to maximize the value of the estate.

8

And if their bid for the new equity is so high that we

9

think we're really going to get more money out of their

There comes a point at which they
It's in

10

plan than out of foreclosure, then they can win the

11

auction with our blessing.

12

But we think this property is worth a lot more

13

than what we're going to get under this confirmed plan.

14

And up to the point where they have satisfied us that

15

they're going to make us better off, we will continue to

16

outbid them, bidding our deficiency claim --or bidding

17

cash, because we get it back on a deficiency claim -- so

18

that -- so that we can win the auction.

19

many cases, if banks -- if senior unsecured creditors, or

20

senior secured creditors with unsecured deficiency claims,

21

are allowed to bid, that's how the auction will work.

22

And -- and in

Now -- now, let me add, to the best of my

23

knowledge, no debtor and no creditor has ever proposed an

24

auction as the way to get around Section

25

1129(b)(2)(B)(ii).

Only bankruptcy judges have ever

proposed that as a creative solution.

3

very great deal to them,

4

And creditors don't like it because they don't want to go

through the nonsense of an auction.

have the absolute priority rule applied as it's written.

QUESTION:

Debtors don't like

They just want to

Suppose the court had said that the

bank could contribute dollar for dollar with the equity

holders and receive a proportionate share of the equity.

10

MR. ENGLERT:

Not, not quite exclusivity.

We'll

12

say we'll -- we'll allow the bank to participate on the

same terms as the - -

statute.

That would clearly violate the

No question it would violate the statute.

16

QUESTION:

Because?

17

MR. ENGLERT:

Because they are receiving

something

interest -- on account of their junior claims of interest.

20

- the right to the 50 percent equity

QUESTION:

Well, but you're getting the same --

22

your prior equity interest.

MR. ENGLERT:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. ENGLERT:

No, but --

So how can that be?
The statute doesn't ask whether we

because we're the objecting impaired class.
QUESTION:

3

Well, but I -- I -- I'm not so sure.

4

If -- if they have the right and you have the right,

it's not just because of their -- of their position.
MR. ENGLERT:

It's -- it's not just because of

But it's because of their position.

10

then

Well,

It's

that would be the case if you

Under our view of the case, it is

never possible for him to say for that reason, I'm going

to choose to allow the equity holders to retain the equity

without some sort of competitive bidding.
QUESTION:

Well, he could have a competitive bid

He cannot do that because he is

thing they would have had to have done to save this would

that the absolute priority rule is not just about money.

others that will allow them to know about the value of the

12

But in addition, another thing the absolute

13

priority rule does -- remember, we're in a reorganization,

14

where this entity is going to continue, many times in

15

cooperation with its creditors, and the creditors have a

16

right to limit the ability of the equity holders to stay

17

in control of that reorganized debtor.

especially in a manner that's going to benefit themselves,

19

to set their own price for new equity interests to

They did, Justice Scalia, but they

never appealed the bankruptcy court's factual finding that

the value of the property was $55.8 million.

13

important to remember in this case that the bankruptcy

judge's factual decision was 2.8 percent -- factual

bank to come in here, having not appealed that factual

determination, and suggest that the bankruptcy judge made

make mistakes that banks should have the right to decide

QUESTION:

Well, but it might be possible, if

there were other people who felt that the property had

6

6 million, but

7

0 million, maybe?

MR. BENDIX:

Well, that's possible.

The

8

interesting fact here is that -- it's important to

9

remember that the bank is here, arguing as an unsecured

10

creditor.

29(b)(2)(B)(ii) and the absolute priority

11

rule only applies to a dissenting class of unsecured

12

claims.

Under this plan, the deficiency claim got all of

the future appreciation in the building until its claim

was paid in full.

5

Therefore, what difference does it make to an

unsecured creditor who gets that whether the building, for

purposes of the bank's separate secured claim -- which

8

they're not here contesting today -- was worth a million

dollars more or less?

They get everything that's there

seems obvious, and it seemed clear to the judge, that this

through with respect to the disagreeing party -- whether

They -- they received a very obvious form of property;

14

namely, 100 percent of the equity in the reorganized

What they're trying to do is create a separate

There was -- there was a general obligation on

10

is it going to make a difference to the decision?
MR. BENDIX:

2

If you accept our interpretation of

"on account of" as meaning in exchange for or in

received this equity interest in exchange for the new
