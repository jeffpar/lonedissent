ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL I. SIEGEL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIEGEL:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

11

There are three reasons why the failure to warn

12

of appellate rights is a structural error which justifies

13

relief as a matter of law.

14
15
16

17
18

First, there is no substitute for a warning that
comes directly from the judge.
Second, there is no way to correct the error on
direct appeal.
And third, a judicial warning has been deemed

19

necessary both by this Court and by the Congress.

20

Turning to the first point, there is no

21

substitute for a --

22

QUESTION:

You -- you state these three reasons.

23

I think Fulminante was where we talked - - talked about

24

structural error and what it took.

25

reasons you cite don't come out of that opinion, do they?

Those don't -- the

MR. SIEGEL:

1

This Court has never dealt with a

2

structural error regarding access to an appeal.

3

structural errors discussed by this Court have been trial

4

errors.

5

All the

But I'd like to analogize this case to a

6

structural error to explain why, using the terms of Hill,

7

the failure to warn by a judge is a rudimentary demand of

8

fair procedure.

9

Why is it there's no substitute for a warning

10

that comes directly from the judge?

11

anticipates that when the defendant hears the warning that

12

comes from the judge, he may at that moment on the record

13

state at the sentencing hearing, yes, I want an appeal.

14

And, indeed, the rule takes account of that possibility

15

because the clerk is empowered to immediately file a

16

notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant who

17

spontaneously requests a notice of appeal after being

18

warned by the district court judge.

19

Because rule 32

For that mechanism to work, the warning has to

20

come from the district court judge, and the failure to

21

follow the rule we submit should, therefore, be akin to a

22

structural error which is remedied as a matter of law.

23

QUESTION:

Is -- is it true that -- that if you

24

are right, the same thing would be said for the rule 11

25

warnings in the plea colloquy, that -- that failure to

1

give any one of them or to give one of them accurately

2

would also be structural error with the same result?
MR. SIEGEL:

3

No, for a very important reason.

4

When a defendant doesn't get his full rule 11 warnings,

5

his attorney, assuming that there's a warning of the right

6

to appeal and it's properly preserved -- his attorney can

7

raise those errors on direct appeal in the court of

8

appeals.

9

You can do that with virtually any error under

10

the Rules of Criminal Procedure except this rule because

11

if a defendant doesn't get the warning from the judge of

12

his right to a direct appeal, that may effectively block

13

the defendant's access to a direct appeal.

14

of an issue is a structural error which we submit should

15

be - -

16

QUESTION:

And that kind

Well, it may or may not, and -- and

17

with other structural errors, you can't tell whether it

18

does or not.

19

it did or not.

20

an appeal, it did not.

21

But in this situation you can tell whether
If, in fact, he knew of his entitlement to

MR. SIEGEL:

We know from the record as a

22

finding of fact from the district court judge, and the

23

defense attorney testified that he discussed the appellate

24

rights with the defendant and that the defendant agreed

25

not to go on with an appeal and to, instead, cooperate.

But we will never know, despite that warning, what would

2

have happened if the judge had then warned the defendant

3

of his appellate rights.

4

QUESTION:

5

care?

6

right to appeal.

It's very possible --

Why do we need to know?

Why do we

What we do know is that he understood that he had a

7

What more do we need to know than that?

MR. SIEGEL:

We have no indication from the

8

record what his response would have been if the judge had

9

told him.

For example, I can tell you from experience

10

that the sentencing hearing is often the low point in the

11

attorney/client relationship, and sometimes defendants do

12

not trust their attorneys, especially if it is an

13

appointed attorney.

14

and have in his mind the thought, oh, I'm going to get in

15

trouble if I file an appeal or my cooperation won't work

16

out if I file an appeal.

17

Sometimes a defendant can be confused

But if the defendant hears it from the district

18

court judge on the record at the sentencing hearing, first

19

he knows it's legitimate.

20

judge tells him under the rule, Mr. Defendant, you have a

21

right to proceed in forma pauperis, to have a free appeal.

22

The structure of the rule then anticipates that in

23

response to what the judge says, the defendant may make a

24

spontaneous statement on the record saying, yes, please

25

file the appeal, and it happens immediately.

Second, the district court

a lot different than the rest of the

1

a little different

2

structure of the Rules of Criminal Procedure.
QUESTION:

3

Well, Mr. Siegel, if your position is

4

correct, that it is a structural error if -- if the

5

defendant were not advised by the judge of the right to

6

appeal but subsequently perfected an appeal, he'd still be

7

entitled to relief under your theory because there's been

8

a structural error I guess.
MR. SIEGEL:

9
10

there - QUESTION:

11
12

Well, I would say that in that case

That's the consequence of labeling it

as you would have us label it.
MR. SIEGEL:

13

There would be no -- the rule

14

wouldn't apply where the defendant had actually filed his

15

appeal.

16

sure the defendant gets his appeal, and if gets his

17

appeal, there's -- there's no reason to apply the rule.

I think this rule, fairly read, is a way to make

18

The same for the exception - -

19

QUESTION:

How about -- is there ever a plea

20

agreement in which a defendant agrees to give up any right

21

to appeal?

22

MR. SIEGEL:

23

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, and -And suppose that were the case.

And

24

again, if it's a structural error, then we ignore that I

25

guess.

MR. SIEGEL:

1

Well, no.

In - - in the case of a

2

defendant who pleads guilty, pursuant to a plea agreement,

3

and then waives his right to appeal, there's a colloquy on

4

the record at the guilty plea hearing where the judge has

5

to explain to the defendant what he's giving up in his

6

rights.

7

can always make a knowing and voluntary waiver on the

8

record of -- of a procedural right, or any right indeed.

9

But it is different where there is no appeal filed and

If there's a knowing and voluntary waiver, you

10

there is no plea agreement waiving the right to appeal.

11

Now, the Third Circuit has recognized another

12

exception which is that if the defendant gets the warning

13

at the guilty plea hearing a few weeks earlier, then

14

that's enough to meet the rule.

15

QUESTION:

But as soon as you start getting

16

exceptions, it seems to me you're strongly cutting against

17

your argument, this is so-called structural error, that

18

it's much like any other kind of error that you evaluate

19

for harmlessness.

20

MR. SIEGEL:

Well, I would have to disagree with

21

that, going back to the fundamental point that you never

22

know what the defendant would have said if he had been

23

told by the judge.

24
25

Now, if there was a colloquy between the
defendant and the judge giving up his appeal rights, then

you know.

If the appeal was filed,

2

the rule is not applicable.

then it's clear that

QUESTION:

4

harmless error determinations,

5

only say there is harmless area - - error when you know - -

6

I mean, you never know for 100 percent certainty.

7

harmless error determinations, you -- you -- you make an

8

assessment which is, you know,

9

some scintilla of a doubt left in it.
MR. SIEGEL:

10

If -- if we applied that test to all
that is to say, you can

In

always -- there's always

Well, Your Honor, we don't dispute

11

the general applicability of the harmless error rule or

12

that there are no broad exceptions to it.

13

is so unique and unusual - -

14

QUESTION:

But this rule

I just think it's unrealistic to say

15

he knew about this right to appeal, but if the judge told

16

him what he already knew, there might have been a

17

different outcome.

18

MR. SIEGEL:

19

QUESTION:

20

it's impossible.

21

unlikely.

22

The -I mean,

I can't say no.

I can't say

It just seems to me very, very, very

MR. SIEGEL:

Well,

in this case,

Your Honor, we

23

submit that the structure of the rule shows that it is

24

likely because this is a rule where the people who put

25

together the rule, which was approved by this Court,

1

specifically created a structure where the defendant could

2

spontaneously request it on the record.
QUESTION:

3

The rule is there so that we don't

4

have to inquire into whether he knew about it all the

5

time.

6

MR. SIEGEL:

7

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
We may have to in some exceptional

8

case such as this, but 99 percent of the cases are taken

9

out of that situation by the fact that on the record the

10

judge asked him and he says no.
But that doesn't speak to the fact of when the

11
12

judge makes a mistake, do we have to assume, even when he

13

knew about that same thing, that somehow this -- this

14

impaired his right to appeal.
MR. SIEGEL:

15

Because the right to appeal is so

16

important and because you can never really know what would

17

have happened if the structure or the rule had been

18

followed, I would say, yes, in this unusual circumstance,

19

just

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SIEGEL:

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Siegel, can we back up for a bit?
Yes.

Yes, Your Honor.

Is it clear that defendant knew?

23

defendant, who also testified, say, yes, he knew?

So, it is -QUESTION:

But why do we have to go beyond the

10

fact that there is a - - there's a second claim here, and

11

the second claim was ineffective assistance of counsel for

12

failure to take the appeal that the defendant requested

13

him to take.

14

the defendant's own claim, we have to determine --we can

15

only conclude that he knew.

16

So, at some point in the relevant period, on

MR. SIEGEL:

Well, the district court made a

17

factual finding that there was a discussion between the

18

defendant and his attorney --

19

QUESTION:

Why do we need a finding?

We've got

20

this -- we've got the defendant's claim of ineffective

21

assistance, which is predicated on the fact that he knew

22

he had a right of appeal and told his lawyer to take it

23

and his lawyer didn't.

MR. SIEGEL:

Why do we have to go beyond that?

QUESTION:

Well, let's leave per se rules aside

what facts should be the predicate for our decision, why

do we have to go beyond the - - the second claim here of

he had a right to appeal.

Just as a factual matter in determining

MR. SIEGEL:

Because no matter what was stated

by the petitioner, there is always the possibility that if

10

the defendant had been properly warned by the judge, as

11

contemplated by the rule, that he would have --

QUESTION:

13

different question.

14

can we make the assumption that he in fact knew?

15

seems to me, of course, we've got to make the assumption

not say, but it took him 4 years to bring this forward, so

2

at least we're going to limit this automatic operation to

3

the diligent defendant, not someone who waits 4 years to

4

say, oh, I should have been told I had a right to a

5

lawyer?

6

MR. SIEGEL:

Well, there's no question about the

7

4-year delay, but under cases that will be arising under

8

the current law, there is now a 1-year limitations period

9

under the AEDPA, Anti- terrorism and Effective Death

10

Penalty Act.

11

ruling today is going to be this.

12

So, the practical effect of the Court's

If a judge, say, here in the District of

13

Columbia Federal District Court goes through a sentencing

14

hearing and neglects to inform the defendant of his

15

appellate rights, and 4 or 5 months later, the defendant

16

is taken to another State and placed in a penitentiary and

17

meets a jailhouse lawyer who says, hey, you -- you had a

18

right to an appeal, you had a right to be informed, when

19

the defendant files that motion within the 1-year period,

20

the outcome of this case is going to decide whether the

21

judge can do one of two things.

22

On one hand, you can do what happened in the

23

Gaeta case in Massachusetts, Judge Tauro's rule, which is

24

simply say, well, I've reviewed the transcript of the

25

sentencing hearing, I see there was an error here.

going to reinstate the sentence, and we're going to

2

reinstate the appellate rights and have the clerk file a

3

pro se notice of appeal on behalf of the defendant.

4

If you adopt the Government's position that the

5

Timmreck and Hill standards requires proof of prejudice in

6

this particular instance, then the judge has got to ask

7

the marshall to bring the defendant back from the prison.

It seems to me that judicial efficiency in the

interests of the Federal courts cut in favor of a rule

discretion to simply correct the error in an expeditious

That is true, Your Honor.

But the

question of a voluntarily and knowing guilty plea is

So - - so, are we just discussing this

12

in the abstract, or did this defendant have something

QUESTION:

Is -- is that correct, that -- that

the only two claims that he's raised are those?
MR. SIEGEL:

The only claim that is active now

14

in the 2255 petition is the failure of the judge to inform

Is that correct?

MR. SIEGEL:

20

On this point, however, I'd point out an

Yes, in the 2255 petition.

agreement with the Government at page 25 of their brief

22

where they point out that proving a meritorious issue on

23

MR. SIEGEL:

They added to the rule to require

requiring now under the guidelines that defendants be

MR. SIEGEL:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROY W. McLEESE, III

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

20

MR. McLEESE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under rule 32, the district court should have

21

informed petitioner at sentencing that he had a right to

22

appeal, but petitioner knew he had a right to appeal and

23

so he was not prejudiced by the district court's failure

24

to tell him what he independently knew.

25

therefore, not entitled to collateral relief.

Petitioner is,

1

To obtain collateral relief, petitioner would

2

have to establish a fundamental defect which inherently

3

results in a complete miscarriage of justice.

4
5

QUESTION:

In other words, he's got to negate

the possibility of harmless error?

6

MR. McLEESE:

7

QUESTION:

The burden is on him?

Yes, in the context of --

Now, why -- why is the burden on him

8

here, whereas the burden, I take it, is on the Government

9

if there's a rule 11 failure?

10

MR. McLEESE:

No, Justice Souter.

In the

11

context of rule 11, as well in this Court's decision in

12

Timmreck, the burden upon a defendant who is alleging the

13

violation of a Rule of Criminal Procedure, as a basis for

14

collateral relief, is on the petitioner to establish that

15

that violation was prejudicial to him.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. McLEESE:

Is -- is that true under 11(h)?
11(h) is a provision which relates

18

to direct appeal, and in circumstances when a defendant is

19

noting a direct appeal from his -- the adjudication of

20

guilt and ensuing sentence on the ground that there was a

21

deviation from the requirements of rule 11, the burden is

22

on the Government to show the harmlessness of the error.

23

But when we move over into a collateral

24

proceeding, the burdens shift.

So,

the burdens alter in the

collateral context, and this Court's decisions beginning

MR. McLEESE:

No.

This Court's decision in

5

Rodriquez and subsequent decisions as well of this Court I

6

think make clear that the complete loss of the right to

7

appeal is a form of prejudice that will entitle you to

relief, collateral or otherwise, without regard to whether

9

you in fact have presently established that you have

10

meritorious claims.

QUESTION:

So, this case would have come out the

12

other way appropriately in your view if the defendant in

13

fact did not know within the 10 days that he had a right

to appeal.

15

MR. McLEESE:

I should add the qualification

16

derived from this Court's decision in Timmreck that in

17

some cases there might be a question as to whether the

18

defendant would have wanted to or would otherwise have

19

been able to appeal.

20

agreement.

22

a defendant might not have known that he had a right to

would find later, be unable to establish that he would

MR. McLEESE:

They said -What they said was, he has been

5

QUESTION:

Correct.

6

MR. McLEESE:

And it reached that conclusion

7

based not solely on the rule 32 violation, but on two

8

other features of the case that supported a conclusion of

9

prejudice.

10

One was that the defendant who had up to that

11

point been represented by an attorney had his attorney

12

withdraw at the sentencing proceeding, and therefore there

13

was no attorney around to give the advice that it's

15

And second, that the defendant at the sentencing

proceeding indicated to the judge that he wished to pursue

further in forma pauperis.

19

there would be no reason to make that request unless he

20

wished to appeal.

21

And the Court pointed out that

And the Court went on in Rodriquez to say that

on the defendant's articulated desire to appeal, coupled

24

with the other two failings, the failure to comply with

failing, but the withdrawal of an attorney so that the

2

defendant was unrepresented, combined to deprive the

3

defendant of the right to appeal.

4

And that case is completely different from the

5

present case where all you have is a rule 32 violation,

6

and that rule 32 violation is, without dispute, treated as

7

playing no causal role in - - in interfering with the

defendant's ability to appeal at all because the defendant

knew he had a right to appeal.
QUESTION:

Did he know he had the right to have

doesn't rule 32 say two things?

MR. McLEESE:

I

I think that the

the

2

weight of authority is not as disproportionate as

3

petitioner would suggest, but I think the principal

4

explanation for that is that the case law in this area

5

evolved before much of this Court's collateral relief

6

jurisprudence, and it -- there is not a single court of

7

appeals that has applied a rule of per se collateral

8

relief when it considered the applicability of Timmreck.

9

None of the cases that apply a rule of per se collateral

10

relief have confronted Timmreck.

11

that has considered Timmreck has concluded that Timmreck

12

forecloses this claim.

1imit.

2

The Government suggested that if the defendant

3

doesn't meet the 10-day limit,

that it can be corrected if

4

he acts promptly.

5

to file a late notice of appeal if he shows good cause for

6

doing it, but that's only a 30-day window of opportunity.

7

And what happens as a practical matter is that the

8

defendant gets moved quickly by the United States

9

marshall.

The defense counsel can ask the court

Sometimes defense counsel doesn't get to him.

10

The defendant could be moved across State lines to a

11

Federal penitentiary or can be in transit to a Federal

12

penitentiary and not be able to get in touch with him.

13
14

So,

that 30-day limit at the -- at the maximum

and it's a 10-day limit with the 30 days for good

15

cause - - is a very short limit.

16

that might be one of the reasons why that the courts of

17

appeals are adopting this per se rule even after the

18

Timmreck case.

19

In fact,

QUESTION:

District of Columbia Circuit, discussed the Tress opinion

from the Seventh Circuit which adopted their view of the

account of it, but that court still stood by the -- the

5

per se rule.

So, you could say that they took

And I think - - I think it shows something about

6

7

the severity of the problem.

We were able to find 31

8

cases since 1989 on Westlaw where a defendant had not been

9

warned of his appellate rights and it was necessary to use

10

a 2255 proceeding to get his direct appeal right back.

11

submit to you that that probably represents the tip of the

12

iceberg because normally the way you would expect a case

13

like this to be resolved is that it comes down to the

14

district court judge, he or she takes a look at the record

15

and says, oh, we -- we made a mistake at the sentencing

hearing.

And now that there is a 1-year limitation on

20

interests of -- of the courts, in addition to the

21

defendants, in a fair rule is -- is served by recognizing

22

this is as an unusual structural type of error.

23

The -- there was a question, I believe from

Justice Ginsburg, regarding the warning about the clerk

the district court judge is under absolutely no obligation

2

to tell a defendant that the clerk can immediately file a

3

notice of appeal on his behalf.

4

written it says that on the request of a defendant, the

5

clerk can immediately file a notice of appeal on

6

defendant's behalf.

7

The way the rule is

What that suggests to me is that the drafters of

8

the rule anticipated that in response to the warning from

9

the judge,

the defendant might spontaneously on the record

10

of the sentencing hearing ask for the reinstitution - - ask

11

for his direct appeal.

12

structural error that - - that should be remedied as a

13

matter of law.

office where we've had this problem.

So, I would submit

2

to you that it is something that recurs.

Did I answer your question fully?

QUESTION:

MR. SIEGEL:

Okay.

reference to the Rodriquez case.

And Rodriquez does have

8

a different factual situation, and it is not on point for

9

this case because of the additional facts that were

10

involved.

11

of quotes from this Court's opinion at 395 United States

12

Reports 331 and 332 where the Court observed first, it

13

appears from the trial transcript in this case that the

14

trial judge erroneously failed to advise petitioner of his

15

right to appeal.

16

But I -- I'd like to read to you just a couple

Then the Court went on to make an argument,

17

which is very similar to the argument I've made today.

18

Had he known that the clerk would file a notice of appeal

19

for him, he could easily have avoided the difficulties he

20

has faced.

21

inquired into the circumstances surrounding the attempt to

22

make the in forma pauperis motion.

23

we're talking about the district judge's failure.

24

failure to do so effectively deprived petitioner of his

25

right to appeal.

At the very least, the trial judge should have

His failure -- and

And so I would submit that the rule, which

2

recognizes the value of direct appeal, is a rule which

3

would most -- go furthest in honoring the defendant's

4

right to choose that appeal under all circumstances.

5

Given the new limitation of 1 year, I would state that

this rule creates an unusual structural error which should

justify relief as a matter of law.

If there are no further questions.
