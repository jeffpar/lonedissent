ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. BRAZILE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
To answer the first question of certiorari

11

raised in this case, there has to be a determination made

12

as to whether or not Petitioners in this case engaged in

13

egregious or outrageous conscience-shocking conduct.

14

case, and the case of County of Sacramento v. Lewis, as

15

well as the case of Washington v. Glucksberg, has set

16

forth the test that should be used in -- in making the

17

analysis in a substantive due process case such as this,

18

which involves executive action.

19

This

What the Court has told us is that we look to

20

the historical precedent, we look to the case precedent,

21

and we look at the traditions of our Nation.

22

case, the liberty interest at stake is the question of

23

whether or not an attorney has a right not to be subject

24

to a search at the time his client is testifying before

25

the grand jury.

In this

In this case, the Ninth Circuit found that the

1

2

search warrant was in fact a valid warrant.

3

juncture of the proceeding -- this was a grand jury-

4

proceeding; there had been no charges filed against Miss

5

Baker, so the sixth amendment right to counsel did not

apply.

lawyer at the very moment when his client was being -- was

But do you concede that it -- it was

allowed her to leave the grand jury in order to consult

2

with her lawyer.

3

Now, according to this Court's decision in U.S.

4

v. Williams, she had no right to have that lawyer in the

grand jury room with her.

QUESTION:

But apart from what -- your -- your

12

argument about constitutional violation is my question to

13

you was, is there any sanction for this?

14

could have been -- it could have been executed before the

15

witness appeared before the grand jury or after, but it

16

wasn't a coincidence that they occurred simultaneously.

17

And my question to you, just -- is -- is whether there is

18

any sanction for this?

19

constitutional standard, that's it?

20

MR. BRAZILE:

If the warrant

Or if it doesn't meet the

Well, there is a sanction for this

21

type of conduct if -- under California laws and many

22

others States, there is the tort of abuse of process.

23

they felt that the warrant was used for the -- for an

24

ulterior motive, in an abusive way, they could have

25

brought a tort action for abuse of process.

So, there is

QUESTION:

Is it correct that the service was

MR. BRAZILE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. BRAZILE:

8

I mean, do you

No, Your --

That it was calculated to -No, Your Honor, we do not concede

that the warrant was somehow calculated to interfere or to
interrupt with Mr. Gabbert's practice of his profession.

10

What in fact happened is, earlier in the morning, when

11

they were up in the district attorney's office,

12

Mr. Gabbert indicated that the documents that were

13

requested in the subpoena, that he had the documents.

14

indicated that to Mr. Conn.

15

decided to go and to get the warrant.

16

QUESTION:

He

And it was at that point he

20

right to it.

21

who is an officer of the court, has an instrument of the

22

crime that the government has a right to, why wouldn't the

23

government just ask him for it, or subpoena it?

24

I've never heard of a search warrant for -- for -- is this

25

a normal procedure?

I mean, I would

The government, I take it, has a

I've just never heard of -- if the lawyer,

MR. BRAZILE:

QUESTION:

3

Justice Breyer hasn't practiced in

California.

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

6

Well, I haven't either, but it is a

rather unusual practice out there, I guess.

MR. BRAZILE:

QUESTION:

MR. BRAZILE:

10
11
12

Justice Breyer --

QUESTION:

Well --

Is this typical out there?
Well, Justice --

Is this the way you normally get

documents from lawyers?
MR. BRAZILE:

Just -- Justice Stevens, there is

13

a penal code section that applied here, that requires,

14

when you serve a search warrant on a -- on a lawyer, there

15

are certain formalities you have to comply with, one of

16

which is -- is getting a special master appointed.

17

terms of getting the documents from Mr. Gabbert, they did

18

get a special master, and they did obtain a search warrant

19

from the court.

20

So, in

That's the procedure that's --

QUESTION:

So, that's the normal way you get

21

documents from lawyers out in your -- your esteemed bar,

22

you serve -- you serve warrants --

23

MR. BRAZILE:

24

QUESTION:

25

I do have --

-- rather than call them up and ask

them or serve a subpoena?

Is this typical?

Honor.
QUESTION:
California.

Wow.

My brother is out in

It's a jungle out there.

QUESTION:

My family has lawyers out in

California and never heard of this.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

What?

This is a normal thing; they

don't just ask the lawyer, Please, give me the document?

10

If the lawyer is uncertain about it, they need protection

11

legally, and say, Bring -- get a subpoena, or --

12

MR. BRAZILE:

Well -- well, Your Honor, Justice

13

Breyer, what had occurred is they served a subpoena on the

14

witness, Traci Baker.

15

her to produce the documents, not the lawyer.

17

QUESTION:

And part of that subpoena required

So, why didn't they have a subpoena

for the lawyer?

18

MR. BRAZILE:

19

QUESTION:

Pardon?

Why didn't they have a subpoena for

20

the lawyer?

21

thought that the lawyer would just say, Here it is, if

22

it's undisputed.

23

get a subpoena or some other court procedure?

24
25

If he wants that protection, I would have

And if it is disputed, why wouldn't they

MR. BRAZILE:
He was there.

Well, they chose to get a warrant.

He indicated that he had the documents.

They obtained the warrant.

If they had waited any longer,

possibly to get a subpoena, he could have transferred the
documents to someone else.
QUESTION:

But he's an officer of the court.

MR. BRAZILE:
QUESTION:

Exactly.

I would assume that he would not take

a -- a -- is there some reason not to go on the normal
presumption that people try to follow the law, who are
lawyers?
MR. BRAZILE:

Well, the problem that the

prosecutors were confronted with -- days before the
appearance of the witness before the grand jury, the
subpoena, which required the documents, had been served on
Mr. Gabbert at his office.

He had been in communication

with Mr. Conn days and a couple of weeks before the
incident occurred.
So, he knew exactly what documents they were
after, and he never at one time volunteered, Oh, by the
way, here they are; I'll give them to you, you don't need
to subpoena anyone.
In their minds, the witness was giving the
documents to her lawyer.

She was not producing the

documents as required by the subpoena.

To search

Mr. Gabbert, if the documents are in fact in his
briefcase, they wanted to get a warrant -9

QUESTION:

When did the subpoena require the

2

production of the documents?

3

MR. BRAZILE:

4

QUESTION:

Pardon?

The subpoena required the production

5

of the document where and when?

6

MR. BRAZILE:

The subpoena required the

7

production of the documents on March 21st, 1

8

of her grand jury testimony.
QUESTION:

4, the day

Well, she didn't have a duty to

10

produce it before she showed up before the grand jury, did

11

she?

12

MR. BRAZILE:

13

her at her grand jury testimony.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BRAZILE:

16

QUESTION:

She had to produce it with -- with

At the time of her testimony?
Correct.

So, at the time you served the -- the

17

search warrant, she was not in default on the subpoena,

18

was she?

1
20

MR. BRAZILE:

Well, she hadn't gone before the

grand jury at that point time.

21

QUESTION:

Right.

22

MR. BRAZILE:

But she had also earlier indicated

23

that the documents that -- when her apartment was

24

searched -- I believe it was on March the 18th -- she told

25

them during that search that all the documents that you

2

QUESTION:

And I presume --

3

QUESTION:

But there's -- there's no doubt, I

4

take it, that the subpoena was valid under California law?

5

MR. BRAZILE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist,

6

the subpoena was valid under California law.

7

never been any challenge to the warrant -- I mean to the

8

subpoena.

9

QUESTION:

There has

And I assume that the reason it was

10

served that morning was that she said she wasn't bringing

11

the documents with her, because her lawyer had them, and

12

that they wanted the documents in order to examine her

13

before the grand jury when she appeared?

14
15

MR. BRAZILE:

That's -- that's correct, Justice

Scalia.

16

QUESTION:

So, if you didn't get the doc -- the

17

documents from the lawyer, and she showed up without them,

18

she'd have to go ahead with her grand jury testimony

19

without the documents to cross-examine her with?
MR. BRAZILE:

20

happened.

And, essentially, that's what

And -QUESTION:

Well, did you -- when -- when your

23

client got to that point, did -- did your client say to

24

the -- to the lawyer, We -- we are told that you have the

25

documents subject to the subpoena; will you give them to

QUESTION:

9

MR. BRAZILE:

To the lawyer?

Yes.
No, they did not.

Did they say, Please give them to us?
No.

They didn't do that?

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BRAZILE:

No, they did not.

Why didn't they do that?
There was a discussion upstairs,

12

before they went down to the grand jury room.

13

Mr. Gabbert indicated that he had the documents and that

14

the documents were in his briefcase.

15

QUESTION:

16

they're subject to subpoena?

17

And

At that --

But nobody said, May we have them;

MR. BRAZILE:

Mr. Conn did not say that, but

18

Mr. Gabbert knew full well that the documents were subject

19

to a subpoena, because a subpoena was served on his

20

office.
QUESTION:

21
22

25

I just wanted

to know whether anybody asked for them.

23
24

No, I'm sure he did.

QUESTION:

1

But this case comes to us on summary-

2

judgment.

I take it you can argue the case -- that you do

3

argue the case on the assumption that it might be proved

4

that this warrant was timed so as to deliberately

5

interfere with the representation of the client before the

6

grand jury.

7

no substantive due process violation.

position?

And you say that even if that is so, there is

MR. BRAZILE:

9

Is -- is that your

Justice Kennedy, that's correct.

10

Even if it was timed in that fashion, there still would

11

not be a substantive due process right violation here.
QUESTION:

12

Do you concede that there may well be

13

a fourth amendment violation -- that's not before us; and

14

I take it that will be inquired into on remand to the

15

district court -- but do you concede, for the sake of

16

argument, that there may be a fourth amendment violation?

MR. BRAZILE:

fourth amendment violation because --

21

I don't concede that there was a

QUESTION:

But there may be, that that's an open

question?
MR. BRAZILE:

Well, as to the second search that

22

occurred after the grand jury testimony, that is still an

23

open question.

And that issue will have to be resolved --

Honor.

The -QUESTION:

3
4

There were two searches, Your

I thought we were talking about the

search that was going on during the grand jury testimony.

5

MR. BRAZILE:

6

QUESTION:

That -- that's correct.

But --

That -- I thought that was -- that --

7

that was the search which he says interfered with his

8

right to represent his client.
MR. BRAZILE:

9

Correct.

And the Ninth Circuit

10

has held that that search was a valid -- that warrant was

11

a valid warrant.

12

question.

So, there really is no Fourth Amendment

QUESTION:

13

Well, it may be a valid warrant, but

14

an unreasonable search.

Is -- is the question of the

15

reasonableness of that search still an open question?

16

MR. BRAZILE:

No.

17

QUESTION:

Okay.

18

QUESTION:

Because that was put under the fifth

And --

19

amendment.

The other part of the case that is still alive

20

in the district court, as I understand it, was put under

21

the fourth amendment, because there was no warrant for the

22

second search.

QUESTION:

MR. BRAZILE:

1

QUESTION:

And in -- in -- in that light, since

2

there is this piece of the case that unquestionably

3

remains alive --

4

MR. BRAZILE:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

-- the second, unwarranted search,

6

why wouldn't it be open to the plaintiff to amend the

7

complaint to assert that the first search violated the

8

fourth amendment, because, although there was a warrant,
it was -- the timing of it was unreasonable?

10

MR. BRAZILE:

In this case, I think the -- the

11

way the complaint was pled, yes, they would have to amend

12

the complaint to state such a cause of action.

13

would be our position that under these facts, the

14

execution of that warrant was not unreasonable.

15

QUESTION:

But it

But it would still be as -- there's

16

nothing that is before us now that would foreclose the

17

plaintiff from, in the district court, moving to amend the

18

complaint to add to the fourth amendment claim that's

1

already there, this further fourth amendment claim?

20
21

22

23

MR. BRAZILE:

Not as to the first search.

As --

they could amend the complaint as to the second search.
QUESTION:

No.

The second search is not before

us, as I understand it.

MR. BRAZILE:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

1

MR. BRAZILE:

2

QUESTION:

That's correct.

You have made an argument that this

3

is not a violation of the fifth amendment due process

4

clause.

5

it's a violation of the fourth amendment.

6

amici -- amici briefs made that suggestion, that if

7

there's anything wrong here, it has to do with the fourth

8

amendment, not the fifth amendment.

My question to you is, it was never asserted that
But one of the

So, could the complaint be amended to so assert?
MR. BRAZILE:

10

11

yes, the complaint probably could be amended.
QUESTION:

12

13

Well, that issue isn't before this

Court at all, is it?

14
15

It's -- it's -- Justice Ginsburg,

MR. BRAZILE:

No, it's not before this Court,

but - -

QUESTION:

Getting to the issue that -- that is

and was executed in a way deliberately to interfere with

the representation of the client, is -- is the only State

MR. BRAZILE:
QUESTION:

10

Those cause of actions, no.

That -- that is to say, if there is

11

adequate remedies under the State -- an adequate remedy

12

under State law, is that a ground for saying that there is

13

no substantive due process right under the 14th amendment?

14

MR. BRAZILE:

Yes, it could be.

Because if --

15

if we allow for any and every alleged governmental tort to

16

be a 14th amendment violation, then the 14th amendment

17

essentially becomes a font of tort law.

18

That's why what we're saying in our -- our

19

position is that, in order to have a 14th amendment

20

violation, you need a complete ban or exclusion from the

21

practice of the profession, not this temporary delay or

1

Well, is there any case from our

Court that says there's a substantive due process right to

The cases from this Court, Your

There's also the case of Cafeteria Workers v.

Those cases deal with someone losing their job.

There's the case of Board of Regents

But, by analogy, those cases would suggest, and it's our

position, that you have to have a ban or exclusion or

question of -- of qualified immunity.

that this right that's being alleged here, this right to

conscience shocking conduct in this case, or that there is

would address how you deal with witnesses and lawyers

12

MR. BRAZILE:

The district attorney's office

13

does have a manual that governs grand jury proceedings.

14

But I don't believe it's specific as to the situation that

15

arose here.

16

would have governed this situation that they were faced

with.

18

that they were confronted with.

19

And I can't think of any ethical rules that

Because these were some rather unique circumstances

So, I think the remedy, if there is one, is

20

through the State tort law.

And I think, clearly, as I

21

indicated earlier, Justice Ginsburg, the tort of abuse of

22

process is what would remedy a situation like this, where

23

they're alleging that we used the warrant in a deliberate

24

fashion to somehow deprive someone of -- of a right or to

25

harm a particular person.

1

but it's not the 14th.

That's not the

vehicle.

Because we don't want to have the 14th amendment

as a vehicle or a mode for setting rules that are going to

want the 14th amendment to somehow supervise how the grand

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Our contention has been, from the time that we

of the litigation, that the prosecutor's action here was

20

to intentionally time the execution of the search warrant

21

so as to prevent Mr. Gabbert from giving counsel to his

client outside the grand jury, and specifically with

23

Did he ask to have the search stopped?

conducted, that once he invoked the privilege, under that

3

law, the search has to stop.

4

read -- as a matter of fact, one of the reasons, as

5

indicated in the complaint, that did not allow Mr. Gabbert

6

to leave the room was that the special master, who was in

possession of the documents, insisted on copying the

MR. LIGHTFOOT:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

You said that under the California

14

statute that governs this, once he invoked the privilege,

15

the search should have stopped.

16

Does he have a cause of action under the California

17

statute?

18

MR. LIGHTFOOT:

And you say it did not.

We -- we pled it under the

Okay.

Now, may I -- one related

question.

I take it, based on the representations of --

of counsel on the other side, that you did not, or have

not, raised a claim that this search, under the warrant,

was an unreasonable search within the meaning of the

fourth amendment; is that correct?

9

MR. LIGHTFOOT:

We did, Your Honor, but not on

10

the basis of the timing of the search, so as to prevent

11

him from giving counsel to his client.

12

13
14

QUESTION:

Is there any reason that you could

not raise that claim?
MR. LIGHTFOOT:

Well, Your Honor, we didn't --

we don't see this as a -- as a -- as particularly a fourth

17

QUESTION:

Well, you're -- you're saying you

18

want us to see it as a 14th amendment problem, but my

19

question is, why shouldn't you raise it as a fourth

20

amendment problem?

21

a claim for relief can be raised under a specific

It has the manner -- it has to do

QUESTION:

Well, if that is the case you relied

on, surely you lose on the qualified immunity ground.

6

Because it's -- it's a great leap, wouldn't you agree,

7

from that to supporting your present claim?

8

MR. LIGHTFOOT:

Well, that's the -- that's the

closest case in the Supreme Court.

There -- there's a

10

case in the Eighth Circuit, decided in -- in 1974; Wounded

Ninth Circuit held -- at the precise moment in time when

QUESTION:

Well, of course there was a reason;

Menendez Defendants.
MR. LIGHTFOOT:

But, Your Honor, it was made

clear to the prosecutors as early as the day the -- the

10

subpoena was served on the lawyer that she had a fifth

11

amendment right to refuse production.

ultimately -- that was the ruling of the California court.

It was -- it was a clear example of her -- her exercising

And so, when he -- when Mr. Gabbert came to

opportunities to get the counsel, the advice from her

he was there to give her.

QUESTION:

Well, what would he have told her

different from "Read the card I gave you"?
MR. LIGHTFOOT:

Well, it depends, Your Honor, on

that the argument you're now making is just totally wrong.

16

MR. LIGHTFOOT:

So

Your Honor, our claim doesn't

17

rest on whether or not Ms. Baker had a sixth amendment

18

right to counsel.

19

under practice and procedure in California, to leave the

20

grand jury.

21

She was -- she was afforded the right,

You can't give a right and then --

QUESTION:

You also said earlier in your

22

argument that -- that she refused to -- she had a right

23

not to turn -- a fifth amendment right not to turn over

24

the documents.

25

MR. LIGHTFOOT:

She did, Your Honor.

What is that?

You have a right not

QUESTION:

There -- there is a fifth amendment

right not to turn over evidence which you have if -- if

11

the evidence would incriminate you?

12

MR. LIGHTFOOT:

If the act of production would

13

tend -- you're virtually saying, "These are my documents,"

14

that verbal conduct is incriminating.

15

Mr. Gabbert had indicated to the prosecutors beforehand;

16

asked for a period of time so that he could make the

17

motion -- pursue a motion to quash before the court, which

18

was denied.

1

And that's what

When he did attempt to file the motion on -- on

20

the Friday before the Monday appearance, the first thing

21

the prosecutors did was to get a search warrant and go out

22

themselves and search through her apartment, to see if

23

they could find the documents.

24
25

It was their intent, when they took him aside,
not to get the documents from him, but to bring her in,

5

That's what our theory

They could have done that a number of ways.

The

6

way they chose to do it was to use the search warrant to

7

separate them.

And that's what we --

MR. LIGHTFOOT:

and remained outside the grand jury before she was ordered

13

to come back in and -- and answer questions.

She was allowed to leave on two occasions,

No, it includes -- she

She was not asked

And as the Court knows, the search warrant that

the prosecutors got on the morning in question was a

search warrant not only to search Mr. Gabbert, through the

special master, but to search Miss Baker, as well, for the

documents.

They had the special master there, and they

If they were intent on finding the documents on

the person of Miss Baker,

brought her in and, before asking her to produce the

documents, they asked her questions that would have

that would intend to incriminate her.

There's nothing here that shows that,

on the two occasions when she left and came back, that the

10

prosecutors inside the grand jury room knew that she

11

hadn't been able to find her lawyer.
MR. LIGHTFOOT:

12

Well,

there -- there is, Your

13

Honor.

Because, as I indicated before,

that she

1

Well, the record indicates, Your

2

Honor, that, after she left the grand jury the first time,

3

that the two prosecutors left the grand jury room, as

4

well.

5

And as we know, it was one of the employees of the

6

district attorney's office, during that break, who

7

actually spoke to Mr. Gabbert.

8

So, they would have seen her out in the hallway.

And the other indication is that Mr. Oppenheim,
who was there, having been picked by the district

10

attorney's office as the special master to perform this

11

search, he never came back and reported his findings until

12

after her appearances before the grand jury.

13

QUESTION:

So --

Well, would he report -- under

14

California law, would the special master report to the

15

grand jury?

prosecutors, Your Honor.

No, he would report to the

No, Your Honor.

There's no

provision in the statute who he reports to.

and accompanied the district attorneys and introduced to

But he was

1

what the results of his search were.
QUESTION:

2

3

And that -- that was all as

contemplated by California law?
MR. LIGHTFOOT:

4

Well, not -- not all of that,

5

Your Honor.

The California law requires that when the

6

master first approaches the lawyer who is the subject of

7

the warrant, that the lawyer be given the opportunity to

8

essentially turn it into a subpoena and voluntarily turn

9

the documents over.

Which is exactly what Mr. Gabbert did

10

here.

11

the Ninth Circuit indicated, his first act was to turn

12

those over to the special master.

13

He had copies of two of the three pages.

And as

But the -- despite the mandate of the California

14

statute, the -- the search continued.

The mandate of the

15

statute is that if at any point the lawyer invokes the

16

attorney-client privilege with respect to any of the

17

materials, then it's the duty of the master to seal the

18

documents and take them to a court for that court to

19

resolve the disputes with respect to the privilege.

20

And as we know, Mr. -- from the record --

21

Mr. Gabbert invoked the privilege consistently during the

22

20 minutes to a half an hour that the search took place.

23

And according to Mr. Oppenheim, the master's testimony,

24

because the documents didn't have the words

25

"attorney-client privilege" on them, he didn't view them

as privileged.
And so, when he went back to the prosecutors, he

told them there was nothing in the files that was

privileged.

outside the grand jury room.

And that's when the second search took place

Your Honor, with respect to the -- to the
