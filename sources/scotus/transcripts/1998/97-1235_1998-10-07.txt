ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE A. YUHAS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. YUHAS:

11
12

13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
We are asking this Court to decide three issues

14

in this inverse condemnation case.

15

important the constitutional standard for review of a

16

city's land use decision does not allow the imposition of

17

takings liability based upon a de novo second guessing of

18

the city's policy and factual determinations.

19

First and most

Second, courts, not juries, are the appropriate

20

decisionmakers for all inverse condemnation liability

21

issues and, finally, the concept of rough proportionality

22

does not apply to this case, where the city denied the

23

proposed development.

24
25

What ties these issues together are the concepts
of deference and the concepts of the limited role of the

Constitution and the Federal courts in the local land use

planning process.

3

This case is not atypical in some respects.

The

4

city was faced with a complex decision it had to reconcile

5

competing interests, sift through facts, and exercise its

6

discretion and judgment, and.it did so.

Five times.
It did so, Your Honor.

It was a

11

that is, its consideration of the restoration plan

20

fact, the city council had faced the question as to

21

whether there was an adequate recommended plan.

There was access, and there was the

in question was reasonable, the history of the zoning and

2

the previous attempts are relevant, are they not, in

3

determining the reasonableness of the city's action?
MR. YUHAS:

4

I submit that the issue is not the

5

reasonableness of the city's action, but rather the issue

6

is whether, in fact, the city's action in the first

7

instance bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate

8

goal.

QUESTION:

Well, could you -- suppose you told

10

the jury, the issue for you to decide is, was the decision

11

based on reason?

question?

I've read the record.
MR. YUHAS:

I submit that the question presented

to the jury in the instructions was, does the city's

action bear a reasonable relationship to a legitimate

goal.

1

you said those are presented here, and it seems to me that

2

the past history of what the developer was required to do

3

is relevant to that.

4

MR. YUHAS:

And we didn't argue that the jury

5

could not consider that past history, but on the specific

6

issue that the jury was asked to address, over our

7

objection, because we continue to believe that that is an

8

issue for the court, on the first prong, the substantially

9

advance a legitimate public interest, that prong, which

10

derives essentially from substantive due proc language,

11

that is a deferential test.

12

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that the jury

13

was not entitled to consider the length of time that these

14

proceedings were underway at all?

15

MR. YUHAS:

16

QUESTION:

17
18

I'm not suggesting that, Your Honor.
How long were they underway, from

beginning to end?
MR. YUHAS:

The first time that the city was

19

presented with this development application was 1983.

20

final consideration was 1986.

21

planning for 1983, because the local coastal plan was

22

being implemented or developed at that time.

The

There was some additional

QUESTION:

What happened between 1986 and now?

MR. YUHAS:

After 1986, the testimony is that

the developer made no further effort to develop the

the developer paid, and something less than - -

6

QUESTION:

The property was sold in

We have a lawsuit here.

Surely the

lawsuit must have begun sometime after 1986, one hopes.
MR. YUHAS:

Well, one hopes.

Believe it not,

7

the lawsuit began in 1986.

8

there was a ripeness challenge, that went up to the Ninth

9

Circuit, it was reversed, it came back, and that

10

11

In 1986 the lawsuit was filed,

resulted

in the trial that brings it to today.
QUESTION:

May I ask about that ripeness

12

challenge, and it relates to how significant this jury

13

trial issue is because, as I understand it, the Ninth

14

Circuit said it was ripe because at the time California

15

had no proceeding which the developer could bring, but now

16

California does and, as I understand our case law, a

17

developer in the situation that this one is in would be

18

obliged to go to the State court, not Federal court, is

19

that correct?

20

MR. YUHAS:

21

QUESTION:

22

And under the California procedure

the liability issue would not go to a jury.

23

MR. YUHAS:

24

QUESTION:

25

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is also correct, Your Honor.
So is there, now that the States have

been told that they must have these proceedings, is this

1

question of jury trial or not just a question for these

2

cases hanging over from the eighties?

3

MR. YUHAS:

Your Honor, I certainly submit that

4

the issue of the jury trial is very significant to my

5

client in this case.

6

think, great significance directly in cases litigated in

7

the State courts.

8

9

QUESTION:

It is not -- it does not have, I

Does it have any continuing

significance at all?

That's my question, because if

10

there's no ripe challenge until we've gone to the State,

11

the State would decide those questions.

12

decide the liability questions, and then you might have

13

some constitutional question about it.

14

MR. YUHAS:

The State would

There are two issues that were

15

raised, one which was raised by the amicus filed on behalf

16

of some of the States is there might be, under some

17

circumstances, a question as to whether, in fact, the

18

State determination would be fully collaterally estoppeled

19

in a subsequent case, or whether it would give rise to

20

collateral litigation.

21

But I think of more importance is that,

22

depending upon the nature and the reason why it's

23

determined that there is a right to jury trial, the

24

character of the issue is important.

25

If, in fact, the issue is one that requires a

1

deferential standard, because one that is akin to

2

substantive due process, that is an issue that cuts across

3

simply the procedural issue as to who decides, and goes to

4

what standard should be used.
The Ninth Circuit standard, the reasonableness

5
6

standard, is one that says, when a Government agency makes

7

a decision -- it could be establishing seismic standards.

8

It could be anything, and all a developer, a property

9

owner needs to do, is to say, you know, we have an expert,

10

and our expert says that we can build safely, we can

11

essentially dispute the fact that you need these

12

standards, or we can say that those standards are

13

excessive.

14

QUESTION:

Well, let's talk about -- we're

15

dealing with inverse condemnation here, and it's a two-

16

part inquiry if we follow Agins.

17

inquiry is.

I don't know what the

What do you think it is?

18

MR. YUHAS:

19

QUESTION:

I believe -Agins says two things, that the

20

city's action has to substantially advance a legitimate

21

purpose, and deny the subject property all economically

22

viable use.

23
24
25

MR. YUHAS:

Yes, that is what Agins says.

That's what the jury was instructed here.

traditionally would go to a jury, it seems to me.
MR. YUHAS:

4

Those are certainly ad hoc factual

inquiries.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. YUHAS:

Absolutely.
However, they are not inquiries that

7

I believe are properly decided by the jury, because the

8

decision of economically viable use is not simply a

9

question of valuation.

That is certainly a component, but

10

going with that is the question of what is the reasonable

11

investment-back expectations of the property?
QUESTION:

12

But surely a jury could be charged on

that.

factual component of the question.

Juries decide all sorts of questions where they get

MR. YUHAS:

California, Arizona -Mr. Chief Justice that is absolutely

correct, and if the only issue on a denial of all

say the jury had the competence, but it goes far beyond

million, or 4.8.

I may not have it precisely right, but roughly.

That was the judgment we're reviewing.

MR. YUHAS:

The taking damages went all the way

to trial.

sold the property, but --

MR. YUHAS:

QUESTION:

But it's a temporary taking.
It is, Your Honor.
All right.

Now, if that's so, and if

10

I believe the jury could assess this question, had it

11

during that time been deprived of all value, I suppose

12

that's a jury question in my mind, supposedly.

13

decide that question, whether or not all value disappears

14

from the property, therefore it warrants -- and, moreover,

15

the jury could assess the amount.

All right.

They can

If I believe those two things, is

there any reason for me to go further in this case?

MR. YUHAS:

QUESTION:

MR. YUHAS:

I believe there is, Your Honor.
Why?
First, in this case the evidence was

undisputed and, in fact, the jury was instructed that if

22

they found insubstantial value --

QUESTION:

Could anyone have found -- could

24

anyone, any reasonable person have doubted that the

property lost all its value during that temporary time?

Is there some evidence here?

Is there some dispute?

I mean, I know there is a dispute as to whether

or not, when they got paid the money later -- I mean, you

had 4.8 million.

value?

I understand that dispute.

7

MR. YUHAS:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. YUHAS:

But during

Oh, very much so.
There was.
In fact, the plaintiff's expert

10

opined that immediately after the city's action the

11

property retained $2.9 million in value, and he opined

12

that that value from that point in time went up, so that

13

when the property was sold to the State in its regulated

14

State it was worth $4.5 million.

15

Now, that was, to be fair, according to that

16

expert, a diminution value.

17

believe was in the ball park of about 50 -- about 55

18

percent, but, in fact, there was substantial value the

19

entire time and that's why, when the jury was instructed,

if this property has substantial value, you should

conclude that there has been no denial of economically

viable use.

didn't want this land used for anything and wanted to

That's

Now, let's talk about deference to the city's

judgment.

8

to.

I can under -- our normal rule is that we do

But where you have a consistent process, as is

10

alleged here, of turning down one plan, the next plan, the

11

next plan, okay, I'll do this to satisfy you, isn't there

12

some point at which, although there's a rational basis for

13

the fifth decision, a rational basis for the fourth and

14

the third and the second and the first, you begin to smell

15

a rat, and at that point can't we say, despite our normal

rational basis review, there's some other factor that

begins to come in here, and that is, at some point you can

say, this is simply unreasonable.

MR. YUHAS:

I submit, Justice Scalia, that that

inquiry does not occur in the first prong of Agins as to

21

whether the decision substantially advances illegitimate

22

use.

fact, there are economically viable uses available.

That comes into the second prong as to whether, in

fact could conclude, well, I guess this thing doesn't have

2

any economically viable use, and presumably it would have

3

no value.

4

But on the first prong, the first prong simply

5

says, is there, in fact, the city's action denying this

6

development, leaving the property as it is, does that have

7

a substantial relationship to a legitimate goal, whether

8

that goal be open space, whether that goal be habitat

9

protection.

10

QUESTION:

What if the commission, instead of

11

saying no, you can't -- we'll reject your plan five times,

12

says, we're going to reject it for 100 units but we'll

13

approve it for 10 units?

14

Now, there the owner can't say it was denied all

economic value, but isn't it possible that an element of

16

bad faith would come in somewhere along the lines of

17

Justice Scalia -- I'm not saying it happened here, but if

a jury or a finder of fact was convinced that the city

council was simply going through motions here, that it was

determined not to really appraise the situation in the

light of the ordinance, couldn't a finder of fact, either

22

a jury or a judge, say that an element of bad faith plays

23

a part in the decision?

QUESTION:

But what the Chief Justice is asking,

3

and I think it was prompted by Justice Scalia's question

4

in my mind as well, let's assume that the city is

ordinances, and that it's in bad faith in the

implementation of its planning ordinance.

8

The property

Is there -- the city still liable in damages for
that unreasonable treatment of the landowner?
MR. YUHAS:

Not under the Fifth Amendment.

12

There may be a remedy under State law and if, in fact, the

13

city participates in an effort to deliberately deflate the

14

value of the property for purposes of condemnation there's

15

a remedy for oppressive and unreasonable precondemnation

conduct, certainly under State law.

QUESTION:

Why doesn't it come under the

that we force this under the economically viable use

criteria rather than under whether it substantially

legitimate Government purpose aspect of this case I would

like to briefly address another point which the Ninth

2

Circuit addressed and that is that the Ninth Circuit,

3

without any prompting by the parties, brought this Court's

4

decisions in Nollan and Dolan into this case and said that

5

the overall denial of the plan in this case had to be

6

assessed under the rough proportionality formulation that

7

this Court announced in the Dolan case.
QUESTION:

8

9

Well, of course, the jury wasn't

instructed on that theory.

The oral arguments weren't on

10

that theory.

I'm not sure why that issue is in the case

11

if the verdict can be sustained on another basis.
MR. KNEEDLER:

12

Well, I -- but -- that seemed to

13

be an important aspect to the court of appeals affirmance

14

of the judgment.
On both page 16 and page 20 of the appendix to

15
16

the petition the Court relies upon the rough

17

proportionality standard as the basis for finding that the

18

jury could have found that there was no sufficient

19

evidence to support the city council's verdict, and it may

20

be sufficient for this Court simply to vacate the judgment

21

and eliminate that discussion from the Ninth Circuit's

22

decision.

23

But we do want to make clear our position on

24

that question, that this Court's decisions in Nollan and

25

Dolan imposed that special rule for a special situation,
21

1

where the concern was that the city might actually be

2

extorting a right of physical access, essentially an

3

interest in property on the land, and using the occasion

4

of a permit approval in order to extort that.

5

It was a special rule for that situation.

In

6

fact, in the Dolan case the Court specifically

7

distinguished that situation from one in which the -- you

8

simply had regulations that controlled the landowner's use

9

of her own property as opposed to having someone come onto

10

11

the property.
QUESTION:

Well, suppose we agree with you that

12

the court of appeals got it wrong on the Dolan point, what

13

is -- how would reversing that, or vacating it, affect the

14

balance of the decision, if at all?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the question then would be

16

whether the court of appeals was correct in affirming the

17

judgment on the ground that there was sufficient evidence

18

from which the jury could have concluded that there was

19

not a reasonable basis for the action in this case, and

20

that really goes to the substantial relationship prong,

21

and we have -- we have two basic problems with that.

22

One is, we believe that the Court's formulation

23

of that aspect of finding a compensable taking in Agins

24

was erroneous, and that the question of whether a land use

25

regulation substantially advances a legitimate

It was not, Mr. Chief Justice.

Ordinarily we don't accept any new

questions or positions from an amicus.
MR. KNEEDLER:

I understand that.

The reason

8

that I do think it's relevant to the Court's

9

consideration, however, is the Court is being asked to lay

10

down a rule for the lower courts in terms of how a jury

Presumably all new points from amicus

MR. KNEEDLER:

My point was that in order to

to be addressed is the nature of the governmental action,

and if we take that into consideration properly, isn't the

issue of bad faith something that may be considered right

14

up front under that particular heading?

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think not.

The purpose of the

just compensation clause is to address the situation where

17

the Government has taken lawful action, but lawful action

unfair to visit that cost of a lawful action on a

Bad faith, arbitrary action, those are not

understand this Court's decision in First English, not

from unlawful governmental conduct, unlawful procedure,

20

but where there's a substantive limitation on development

MR. BERGER:

12

They're very unlikely to make an

It's a determination that the city did not act

arbitrarily, and once the Court makes that determination,

12

as I think it could make legitimately in this case, which

13

is why we did not appeal that finding, the city did not

If this is basically a temporary

clarify what Mr. Yuhas said, and if this is wrong please

15

tell me, that the motive, bad faith and motive were not

16

made issues in this case?

17
18
19

MR. BERGER:

That is correct, Justice Ginsburg.

Motive was not an issue that was submitted to the jury.
QUESTION:

And what was submitted to the jury

20

was either-or, and can you explain to me now why it

21

doesn't make any difference that we don't know whether it

22

was the substantially justified or the no economic value

23

that the jury in fact determined?

24
25

MR. BERGER:

Well, I believe, Justice Ginsburg,

it doesn't make any difference, because, as the court of

appeals explained, the evidence amply supports both prongs

2

of that Agins test, and therefore whichever way the jury

3

went, and they may well have gone both ways, it's

4

supported by the evidence in the record.

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Berger --

6

QUESTION:

Well, how is it amply supported if

7

the Ninth Circuit says that there's no arbitrariness

8

within the meaning of the Due Process Clause?

9

where we get tangled up.

10

MR. BERGER:

That's

I think, Justice O'Connor, it has

11

to do with the level of examination that goes on in a due

12

process case as opposed to a takings case.

13

QUESTION:

What if we assumed --

14

QUESTION:

How is it different in your view, the

15

inquiry of the substantial relationship to a legitimate

16

city purpose?

17

essential due process inquiry?

18

MR. BERGER:

How does that really differ from the

I believe that the essential due

19

process inquiry simply looks on its face at what the city

20

said it was doing, and if the city said we are basing this

21

determination on our conclusion that we need to protect

22

this habitat for a butterfly that nobody's ever seen

23

there, then that is sufficient to get the city past the

24

extremely low threshold of review that happens in a due

25

process case.

1

I think when the matter gets submitted to a

2

determination of whether there's a substantial advancement

3

of legitimate State interest, the jury in this case or a

4

judge if it didn't go to a jury would be entitled to look

5

at what the city is trying to accomplish -- that is, to

6

set up a butterfly preserve - - and look at the means that

7

it adopted to get there, essentially total frustration of

8

the use of this 36-1/2 acre parcel of property, and say,

9

is this an appropriate way to achieve that end as a matter

10

of fact, and I think that that's a different level of

11

examination than you'd get when you just look at, what is

12

the city's rationalization for what it was doing.

13

QUESTION:

But if we read Agins the way Justice

14

Stevens said he remembered, or he thought was intended,

15

then we really would have a conflict, wouldn't we, because

16

Justice Stevens -- I hope I don't misstate him, but he

17

said that he thought of the Agins test, or had at one

18

point thought of the Agins test as being essentially an

19

absolute irrationality kind of test, and if that's the

20

case, then we really would have a conflict between what

21

the court found and what the jury was -- would have

22

apparently found here.

23

MR. BERGER:

It would appear that way, Justice

24

Souter, although I have to say that the trial judge at the

25

time that he made that ruling expressly said that he

1

didn't find it to be in conflict.
QUESTION:

2

No,

certainly one can draw -- I mean,

3

the language is different, and maybe I just -- you know,

4

didn't understand what was going on at the time.

5

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

But the other question,

I

I'd like to

7

have you comment just to be sure I don't -- you have a

8

full opportunity.
Your opponent has said it's perfectly clear that

9
10

they could not have relied on the denying economically

11

viable use of the land because he sold it for several

12

million dollars.

What is your response to that?

MR. BERGER:

13

My response is that this is a

14

temporary taking case, and that there was a period of time

15

that the jury found that this property had no use and no

16

particular value to a private property owner.
The fact that they actually sold the property at

17
18

some later date - QUESTION:

19

But wouldn't that always be true in

20

any case in which time is required to make a zoning

21

decision?

22

can't start construction while they make up their mind and

23

there's a total denial -- is that the same?

24

difference between that and what happened here?

25

There's always going to be a period where you

MR. BERGER:

Sure.

The difference,

Is there a

and I agree

1

with you, Justice Stevens, because that's what the Court

2

said in First English, that there is this period of delay

3

during normal planning, although I think that the

4

developer here in 5 years went sort of overboard in the

5

normal planning process trying to find something that

6

would satisfy the city.

7

But what we have here, as the trial court

8

instructed the jury, that they should focus their

9

attention in awarding damages for a temporary taking from

10

the time in 1986 when the permit was finally denied, the

11

fifth permit application was denied, until sometime

12

between then and the date of trial, so that it wasn't that

13

normal period of planning and waiting and trying to get

14

permits that was compensated in this case.

The developer

15

was essentially told, that's your problem.

You're going

16

to -- you went through all that process.

17

take the heat for that one.

18

You'll have to

But from the time the city denied the permit in

19

1986, from there forward the jury was instructed to

20

determine what the period of delay was in allowing these

21

people to make some productive use of either their

22

property or its monetary equivalent, and to find a

23

monetary equivalent and award it.

Could I ask about the -- coining back

to the jury question, the objection to the jury request,

I believe so, although, like Your

MR. BERGER:

The Fifth Amendment is a critically

this case.

As this Court

It is just as important as the First

The reason that it's important is that people
like this developer need to know that when they are

10

dealing with their regulating local government agencies

11

that their rights are protected, that they can't be simply

12

strung along and abused at the city's whim.

13

I think, looking at the record in this case as

14

the court of appeals laid it out, what you have here is a

15

pattern of abuse, if you will, and I think the jury was

16

entitled to look at that pattern that existed from 1981

when the first application for use of this land was made.
