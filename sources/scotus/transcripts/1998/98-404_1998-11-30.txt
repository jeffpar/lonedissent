ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

10
11

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

Article I, Section 2, Clause 3 of the

13

Constitution requires that representatives be apportioned

14

based on the number of persons in each State.

15

effectuate that requirement, Congress is directed to

16

provide for, quote, the actual enumeration, to occur every

17

10 years, in such manner as Congress shall by law direct.

18

And to

In modern times, as the census has faced

19

increasing challenges, Congress has delegated authority to

20

the Secretary of Commerce to conduct a census in such form

21

and content as he may determine.

22

Following exhaustive study and the unanimous

23

recommendation of the Census Bureau, the National Academy

24

of Sciences, and other professional groups, the Secretary

25

has determined that for the 2000 census, employing

1

statistical sampling, in addition to other means of

2

enumeration, will best achieve the constitutional goal of

3

determining the number of persons in each State.

important -QUESTION:

5

The

General Waxman, I understand there

6

are -- there are two kinds of statistical sampling

7

involved here.

8

one -- rather the second one -- which I -- I gather is a

9

series of 750,000 housing units, selected randomly.

And I want to ask you about the first

And

10

they will then be used to adjust the figures from census

tracts?

That's correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.

the question.

Wisconsin v. City of New York.

the
QUESTION:

2

Well, that initial enumeration is

3

first based on responses and then based on follow-up

4

interviews?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

5

That's correct.

There are --

6

there are three phases, Mr. Chief Justice, to the 2000

7

Census.

8

to every individual household, an 800 number for people

9

who don't want to respond by mail to call in their

The first phase will be a -- a series of mailings

10

answers, the distribution of questionnaires in malls and

11

public libraries and other places.

12

phase.

That's the first

The second phase involves what's called

3
4

non-response follow-up.

5

to physically visit a certain number -- up to 90 percent

6

of the houses in each census tract, and the use of

7

statistical sampling to impute the population

8

characteristics with respect to those homes which did not

9

send in -- mail in their census information and were not

20

located personally.

21

QUESTION:

And that includes both an effort

But when you say up to 90 percent,

22

there -- there is going to be an intentional effort not to

23

do

GENERAL WAXMAN:

No, there -- Justice Scalia,

there is an intentional effort in this census to obtain

1

census information from every household that is known to

2

exist by mailings, by a Be Counted program, by telephone,

3

by the Internet.

4

order to make the population totals for apportionment

5

purposes more accurate, it will not have enumerators

6

physically go to every single house that did not respond

7

to those initial requests for information, but rather will

8

go to enough houses so that 90 percent of every household

9

in each census tract has been the subject of a, quote,

10
11

The Census Bureau has determined that in

physical count.
And it will then use statistical sampling on a

12

completely random basis -- and I think this is key,

13

because none of the plaintiffs have alleged, nor could

14

they, that they have been injured in any way by the

15

effort -- by the attempt to use sampling --

QUESTION:

Let -- let's -- let's stay on the

question of describing this -- this procedure.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

Yes, sir.

The -- once the

19

initial enumeration roster is completed by means of the

20

mail-in, the non-response follow-up, which is both

21

physical and sampling, the national vacancy check, which

22

uses sampling to impute population, there will be what's

23

called an initial enumeration roster.

The Bureau will then conduct, much as it did in
1990, but on a much larger, more sophisticated scale,

How can you know in advance that

there are inaccuracies?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

5

Justice -- Chief Justice

6

Rehnquist, there -- every effort to enumerate the

7

population, from the 1790 Census until now, has produced

8

only an estimate of the true population totals in each

9

State.

That's agreed.

That's understood.

We now have

10

the means -- the -- the Census Bureau and statisticians

11

have developed the means, really beginning in the 1940's

12

and on, to be able to ascertain just how far from the true

13

number the enumeration efforts are -- are -QUESTION:

14

But how can you know -- but if -- if

15

you have this census, which is a very -- and it's

16

inaccurate, it doesn't reflect the, quote, true number,

17

how -- how do you know what the, quote, true number, close

18

quote, is?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

19

Well, the -- I recall that was

20

the -- that was the question that was asked of my

21

predecessor in City of New York v. Wisconsin, as the

22

subject of an explanation in the Court's opinion in that

23

case.

demographers and statisticians have means for very

censuses.

QUESTION:

7

Well, why do we need -- why do we

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, because there -- there is

8

a requirement in the Constitution that every 10 years the

9

respective number of persons in each State be determined.

10

That is the constitutional goal.

11

that goal is the actual enumeration, which is done every

12

10 years and which must be done in the means -- manner by

13

which Congress directs.

14

QUESTION:

And the actualization of

Now --

Well, most people would think that

15

actual enumeration meant a count.

I mean that -- that's

16

what immediately springs to mind.

And how do you get

17

around that?

18

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Well, I think it depends how

19

you define -- actual enumer -- most people would think

20

actual enumeration means a count in the sense of

21

determining the number of persons.

conduct an actual enumeration of the people in Camden

I'm given 30 minutes, the best means that I may have to do

QUESTION:

2

I --

And you would call that an actual

3

enumeration; you sort of scan Camden Yards and say, it's

4

the best I can do, it's 25,000, you would call that an

5

actual enumeration?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

6

Well, the words "the actual

enumeration" I don't think would come up very likely in

8

the context of Camden Yards.

9

what the constitutional phrase means, Justice Scalia, I

But if one is talking about

10

They could have said "the enumeration."
QUESTION:

But for that we would have thought a

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I don't think so.

I think if

6

they had said "The enumeration shall be conducted every 10

7

years," it would have been clear in light of the goal, and

8

particularly in light of the concerns that were expressed

9

during the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention,

efforts by individual States to produce --

QUESTION:

All right.

Isn't -- isn't that sort

of the clue that -- that the word "actual" is not so much

15

follows it is not so much an arbitrary assignment of

representatives, but an assignment which I suppose was

Yes.

QUESTION:

General Waxman, do you mean actual

enumeration is to be contrasted with what the article

5

says, that is, actual enumeration in comparison to three

from Mass -- three from New Hampshire -- was it -- eight

7

from Massachusetts, 10 from Virginia -- that's the

8

comparison for the actual enumeration in place of what was

going -- the enumeration going in?
GENERAL WAXMAN:

10

That's right.

The -- the

They didn't have available to them, as we have had since

QUESTION:

record of how the early censuses were taken.

goes quite methodically through.

And there is

But if you look at the first Census Act, the
Census Act of

790, the very first sentence in that Act --

20

it's Chapter 2, Section

-- essentially equates

to make clear that what it is that they were transferring

imperfect census data all the time, particularly in

It may very well be --

I'd just like to say a few words about the --

the statute, where -- which I haven't had the opportunity

to address today.

But it's our view that Section 141(a)

It is the only command in the code for the Secretary to

sampling in the apportionment census -- at least sampling

13

What we submit to the Court is that it was not that

14

clause -- sampling was prohibited before 195 was enacted

15

because -- for two reasons.

There was a provision,

Section -- old Section 25(c)

of the Census Act -- that

17

required that an enumerator visit every house and record

meaning of the word "census," in 1976, Congress said in

2

the most direct way it could that the census should be

3

conducted in such form and content as the Secretary may

4

determine, including the use of sampling procedures.
Now, the reading that the other side wants to

5
6

give this would -- that is, that Section 195 prohibits

7

sampling for apportionment purposes and requires it where

8

feasible for all other purposes, deprives that amendment

9

of Section 141(a) of any meaning at all.

10

There's nothing

left for those words to do.
And what's most significant to us is that by the

11

12

time Congress enacted this amendment in 1976, the Census

13

Bureau had been using imputation techniques -- in 1940, in

14

1950, in 1960, in 1970, and in 1970 -- and this was

15

known -- this was published by the Census Bureau and the

subject of discussions in mentions in House reports and in

to that, that these introductory sections give the basic

9

then the later sections limit how you do it?

That's

10

their -- I think that's, as I understand it, a basic

11

argument that they make.
GENERAL WAXMAN:

12

Our first argument is that

13

whichever provision is more specific or more general, the

14

first principle of statutory construction is to read the

15

two provisions to the extent -- in a manner in which

16

harmonizes them if that can be done.

17

down to specific versus general, Section 141(a) is much

more specific.

allows the Census Bureau to conduct the apportionment

MS. MAHONEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

I'd like to turn first to the issue of
justiciability.

Congress passed the '98 Appropriations

Act to authorize this litigation to proceed in this Court

11

before the census was taken.

12

absolutely critical to protect the concrete interests of

13

the House of Representatives and also to authorize private

14

parties, who may be injured as well, to bring this

15

controversy to the Court so it could be resolved in time

16

to provide meaningful relief.

17

Because it found it was

The House does not expect this Court to find

18

that it has standing to resolve the issue of standing if

19

if that judgment is affirmed.

21

appropriate, and we would agree that the Court should

22

simply not reach the issue of the House's standing in

23

those circumstances.

It would be perfectly

24

But if for any reason this Court finds that the

private parties do not have standing, it should find that

the House does; that the district court properly-

determined that in these rare and unusual circumstances

3

that Congress acted well within its constitutional

4

authority to provide a cause of action for the House to

5

come to court to resolve this -- this legal issue, this

legal dispute which has created an impasse between the

branches, and to provide relief so that the House will

receive the information that it has requested and needs to

Ms. Mahoney, what is your response to

the -- I guess to the objection that if this is a

18

sufficient basis for standing here, the Congress, as a

19

practical matter, can place an obligation on some agency

20

of the executive branch to provide it with information on

21

a concrete subject; and if it ends up not liking the --

22

the information that it gets, in effect, can sue the

executive branch on matters that certainly impinge on the

your argument?
MS. MAHONEY:

2

3

I don't think so, Your Honor, for

several reasons.
First of all, there has to be a substantial

4
5

nexus between the challenge to the executive branch

6

conduct and the request for information.

7

course is satisfied here because, since the beginning of

8

our history, Congress has always relied upon the executive

9

branch to provide it with a report of the population

And that of

10

numbers, determined in accordance with the constitutional

11

requirement for an actual enumeration, and the Census Act

12

requirements that it be based on an actual count.

13

I -- I think that that nexus is clearly satisfied here.

14

Second, I think this Court could, and should,

And so

15

find that the only kinds of actions that should be

16

challenged -- subject to challenge -- would be those

17

executive branch actions which have traditionally been

18

subject to challenge.

issue of ripeness, and found that here there is really no

dispute that the use of sampling in this case is likely --

reasonable way to resolve this.
The two cases, Your Honor, where I believe that

are most germane would be United States v. Nixon, where of

where the branches have reached an impasse, have tried to

work it out, and it is -QUESTION:

6

Well, they -- they haven't reached an

impasse, because Congress basically has enacted a statute,

and then gives its own separate houses the standing to

destroys all discipline that's required for a separation

And I -- I don't know how -- how would

It's

important because of how the House of Representatives

MS. MAHONEY:

I mean is that -- is that the

Your Honor, the fact that it is

the composition of the House itself is very important

here.

Because that is a concrete interest under this

that a State legislative body that was directly affected

way this proceeded, it was first that a census be taken.

though at the time the -- the States were very familiar

with how to do estimations -- and Thomas Jefferson himself

had done an estimation of the population of Virginia in

that's sort of the converse of the question Justice Scalia

asked about what does "actual" mean if it doesn't mean,

you know, the very narrow confinement?

knows it's -- they have lots of undocumented aliens that

disputes by dragging in the third branch.
MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, I really believe that

3

was rejected in United States v. Nixon.

There, this Court

4

was confronted with a situation where the President said,

5

this is not a case or controversy because I have invoked

6

executive privilege, my subordinate disagrees with me, he

7

cannot come to court to challenge my decision invoking

8

executive privilege, this is not a case or controversy,

9

and this Court unanimously held that the fact that both

10

parties are members, officials of the executive branch

11

cannot be viewed as a barrier to suit, because we have to

12

look behind the captions.

13

And one of the things that this Court stressed

14

is that there was a regulation in place at the time, of

15

the Department of Justice, which authorized the executive

16

branch official to come to court in order to get issues of

17

executive privilege resolved, and this Court said, we must

18

respect and enforce that regulation.

19

And I submit, Your Honor, that if there is

20

reason to decide that controversy based upon the fact that

21

there was a regulation in place, that certainly when the

22

President has signed legislation that authorizes us to

23

6

It just how to interpret the

And those issues have been subject to review in

7

this Court several times in the last decade, so I think

8

that this really was a very appropriate response,

9

especially where here the House itself is essentially

10

captive to the executive branch's decision to proceed with

11

an unlawful plan that's going to alter its composition and

12

deprive it of the information that it needs in order to

13

take corrective action or pass new apportionment

legislation.

QUESTION:

But you agree, do you not, that for

intrastate redistricting and for Federal funding purposes

this is lawful, it is not only lawful but required by the

19

MS. MAHONEY:

Your Honor, we have not made that

20

part of our case because our standing derives from the

21

interest in protecting the House's composition, which

22

pertains to the size of the delegations in the States, but

I think when you read the Census Act it

1

2

certainly indicates that the tabulation of population that

3

is done in the decennial census is supposed to be made

4

without the use of sampling, and that it does not

5

authorize the Secretary to go and make some different

6

tabulation of population.

7

QUESTION:

So you think for any purpose, it

can't be used for redistricting intrastate or for

authorizes it, and --

QUESTION:

That seems to leave nothing for 141

clearly is a general reference to the Secretary's

authority to use sampling.

2

kind of information, but not to determine the population

3

for the decennial census.
Certainly to determine the population for the

4
5

mid-decade census.

195 would allow the Secretary to do

6

that, but I don't think that the Census Act could readily

7

be read to support the view that the Secretary is required

8

to go out and conduct an actual enumeration of everyone in

9

the United States by household under the decennial census

10

and then go back and do it over using sampling for other

11

purposes.

12

I think that the distinction is between the

13

determination of the population in the decennial and the

14

gathering of all the other information, and that that is

15

the best reading of the act, but that is not -- it is not

16

actually squarely presented by our case, because we are

17

here challenging the methods that are being used to

18

determine the size of the State delegations.

19

I'd also like to just make it clear in terms of

20

what actually is being done here in terms of sampling.

21

For nonresponse follow-up there will basically be the

22

judgment that what the plan provides is that the Census

23

Bureau will deliberately not try to go and find out who

24

lives in 10 percent of the households in the country,

25

deliberately.

They're trying to get them all, but they know

MR. CARVIN:

Precisely, Justice O'Connor.

They

11

you'll have 30 percent of the people in a census tract

What they will do is then go send an enumerator

90 percent.

faith effort to count 100 percent of the households that

2

they know are occupied.
This is the first time that the Census Bureau

3
4

has decided it will cost too money -- too much money to do

5

that, so what we're going to do is estimate 10 percent of

6

the population, roughly 27 million people.

7

QUESTION:

But you must agree, because of the

8

summary judgment posture of this case, that the scientific

9

evidence is all in favor of the Government to the effect

10

that you will get a more accurate count of the population

11

their way.
MR. CARVIN:

12

As -- on the summary judgment on

13

the merits we do not contest that it is more accurate,

14

because that's a disputed issue of fact, so no, we are

15

saying regardless of its relative accuracy it is

16

nonetheless illegal and unconstitutional.

17

For standing purposes, my point is that you

18

can't have an apportionment if you accept our allegations

19

as true in 2001, because you won't have the 100 percent

20

apportionment number.
So this is no different than the Census Bureau

21

22

saying tomorrow we'll enumerate 50 percent of the houses,

23

or not conduct any census at all, and that hurts two kinds

24

of people.

QUESTION:

How can that matter be resolved at

I mean, I didn't dwell too

10

long on the counter-affidavits, but among other things it

was clear that the counter-affidavits challenge the very

12

factual basis of the selection figures on which you base

13

your claim, so how can that be resolved at the summary

judgment stage?

15

MR. CARVIN:

Well, under Lujan, remember, they

General Waxman told us that for other purposes

Ms. Mahoney says, well, we don't think it's okay, but it's

not yet in issue.

MR. CARVIN:

It is not yet in issue because

13

they've never come up with such a plan.

14

there's no dispute that this plan, where they will use one

population number for apportionment, redistricting, and

funding, will hurt us because it will cost us money.

smaller share of both congressional districts and -QUESTION:

show that your population is reduced significantly

3

QUESTION:

Well, I don't think there's any

4

question about there being an affidavit that makes those

5

specific references, but I think what's bothering a number

6

of us is that there is an affidavit which basically goes

7

to the assumptions upon which all your calculations are

8

based, and I may be missing something, but assuming there

9

is an affidavit of that sort, why is it significance for

10

intrastate redistricting different from its significance

11

interstate?

12

what it is.

13

There may be a reason.

MR. CARVIN:

I just don't know

Yes, Justice Souter.

The affidavit

14

says that the diminution in Indiana State's population may

15

not result -- may not be severe enough for Indiana to lose

16

a congressional seat.

17

There is no affidavit or similar argument that

18

these counties in the State of Pennsylvania will lose

19

population, and if you lose population, even if it's not

20

enough to cost you a Congressman, nonetheless your funding

21

goes down and your intrastate representation goes down,

22

and the Census Bureau has made an administrative finding

23

that the adjustment that occurred in 1990 is predictive of

24

the results that will occur under the adjustment that they

25

will use in 2000.

When they argued that sampling was more accurate

1

2

than a head count, they had to figure out what results we

3

could anticipate under a head count and they looked solely

4

at the results of the 1990 census and assumed that those

5

results would be replicated down to the census tract

6

level.

7

So since they have found that the results of the

8

'90 statistical adjustment are predictive of the 2000

9

statistical adjustment, they can now not turn around and

10

for standing purposes deny that the '90 statistical

adjustment that we have set out in our facts will again be

replicated in the 2000 statistical adjustment.

the general level of saying, you will lose population,

QUESTION:

9

MR. CARVIN:

-- rather than footnote 25.
And if I haven't made it clear, I

10

hope I have clarified in argument that this is in accepted

11

facts, that the States will use the census number for

12

apportionment absent judicial intervention for intrastate

13

redistricting, and that will cost us voting power.

14

Federal agencies will use the census number to distribute

15

funds, and that will cost us money.

16

So I don't think that this is a situation, the

17

additional point I guess I'd make, is where we need to

18

prove it was scientific --

19

QUESTION:

But the answer to your question was

20

that this is going to happen to you anyway, because we are

21

permitted to have the two census things.

22

MR. CARVIN:

Oh, no.

It would only happen to us

23

if the Census Bureau makes an entirely different decision

24

than is already made.

25

For example, last year in Akins they could have
73
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

denied plaintiff in that case, Mr. Akins, APAC's

2

membership numbers if they'd used a different rationale to

3

withhold APAC's membership information, but this Court

4

held quite clearly that it doesn't matter if the agency

5

can make the same decision pursuant to a different legal

6

rationale, because plaintiffs have ability to challenge

7

the legal rationale that is motivating this plan, and no

8

one argues that they can implement this plan, that they've

9

got to come up with a different plan.
But just as speculation about what the

10
11

Government will do doesn't give plaintiff standing, the

12

Government can't defeat standing by speculating about some

13

other plan that it might come up with for the first time

14

in American history, so in terms of what they are going to

15

do, it will injure us, and it is irrelevant that they

16

could legally injure us if they came up with a different

17

plan, just as it was irrelevant in Akins.

18

QUESTION:

Can I ask you, what about their main

19

point?

20

for population -- except for apportionment purposes the

21

Secretary shall if feasible use sampling, and then they

22

say, a few paragraphs earlier it does say that the

23

Secretary shall take a population census in any form he

24

wants, including sampling, and unless that thing I last

25

said was meant to allow him to do what you don't like, it

They say that there's a statute which says, except

1

would be meaningless.

2

MR. CARVIN:

Well,

but as you pointed out

3

earlier Justice Breyer, all 141 does is authorize sampling

4

as specified in the subsequent statutory provisions that

5

deal directly with sampling.
The Solicitor General argues that the word

6

7

sampling in 141 is therefore somewhat redundant, but the

8

presumption against redundancy has been incredibly

9

rebutted in this statute, because the Solicitor General

10

simultaneously concedes that the Solicitor General's

11

authority for nonapportionment sampling under 141 is

12

controlled by section 195, that you need to read section

13

195 into 141 for nonapportionment sampling.
Also, of course, it's inherent in the statutory

14
15

scheme.

16

They use the word sampling four times.

17

time they gave the Secretary authority in 1976 they threw

18

in, including sampling.

19

Every

Now, we know that wasn't intended to mean

20

anything, because in 14(d), which deals strictly with mid­

21

decade apportionment and therefore deals -- mid-decade

22

census, and therefore has nothing to do with apportionment

23

sampling, it deals strictly with nonapportionment

24

sampling, they have the same language, and they say the

25

Secretary can do nonapportionment sampling.

1

That is entirely meaningless, because everyone

2

agrees that under section 195 the Secretary already had

3

authority to do nonapportionment sampling, so the

4

reference to sampling in the mid-decade sentencing

5

provision was entirely meaningless, showing conclusively

6

that Congress didn't intend for this language to have any

7

substantial import.

8

My final point is, even if the grant to the

9

Secretary is ambiguous, the defendant's plan is still

10

unlawful, because clearly, if you are making a major

11

change in policy after 190 years, this Court has ruled in

12

seven different cases cited throughout our briefs that

13

that change in policy needs to be done through a plain

14

statement rule.

15

unambiguously, and that has certainly not been

16

accomplished here.

It needs to be done clearly and

have a realistic possibility of losing a seat, and since

this is a case, like an environmental impact statement,

2

where the alleged refusal of the Government to provide

3

information is what is at issue, they need not show that

4

providing them the information will definitely benefit

5

them.
QUESTION:

6

No, but is the possibility realistic

7

because one of them will, or because there is a realistic

8

possibility that more than one of them will?

9

MR. CARVIN:

Both are true, perhaps two or

10

three, but again, we're not relying on that part of our

11

affidavit.

12

the counties losing funds and intrastate redistricting

13

power.

14

The uncontested part of our affidavit goes to

That's uncontested.
What is contested is that one or two or three of

15

those six States might lose a Congressman, but as again,

16

under Lujan, we need not show that if they gave us 100

17

percent actual enumeration number, we will definitely

18

benefit.

19

We need only show that it might benefit us

20

realistically, just like an environmental impact statement

21

might realistically benefit you.

22

You need not be caught in a catch 22, where you

23

challenge the Government's refusal to provide information,

24

and the standing requirement is, you must show that the

25

information will definitely benefit you, if the reason you

1

don't have the information is because the Government has

2

unlawfully refused to provide you with that information.

3

So under any theory of standing, we have it both

4

on an interstate basis, and on an intrastate basis, and as

5

the Chief Justice pointed out earlier, this Court will be

6

in no better position to resolve this factual question in

7

200 , because in 200 , as today, there will not be a

percent actual enumeration then.

So if you insist the plaintiffs show you that we

10

will have

0 Congressmen under the

00-percent head count

11

number and we will only have 9 under the defendant's

2

sampling plan, no plaintiff will ever be able to make that

3

showing, because there will never be a

4

enumeration number, since they have decided to stop at 90

5

percent in counting people, and they have decided

6

statistically estimate the rest of those people up to

percent.

Census Bureau has done consistently since 1940 is

unconstitutional in her view, because since 1940 the

of the fact that there is little legislative history to

support the notion that Congress in 1976 affirmatively

wanted to permit sampling, but the legislative history on

their side both on 1976 and in 1957 is deafening.

There

Census Bureau was doing, and the undercount, and talked

sampling, will be at least as accurate as if they had done

physical nonresponse follow-up, and it will increase the

overall accuracy of the census because it will be
