ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT W. RAY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. RAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Respondent, Sun-Diamond Growers, was extensively

12

regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture.

13

In the first 14 months of Secretary of Agriculture Mike

14

Espy's tenure, Sun-Diamond lavished on its chief regulator

15

thousands of dollars in gifts, while it had millions of

16

dollars at stake in USDA programs.

17

Respondent of giving unlawful gratuities under Section

18

201(c) by finding that Sun-Diamond gave the gratuities for

19

or because of the Secretary's official position.

20

the plain language of the statute, an official act --

21

Section 201(a)(3) -- means any decision or action on any

22

matter which may be pending before the public official in

23

his official capacity.

section we're looking at,

the situation where the defendant directly or indirectly

gives anything of value to a public official for or

by that official.

public official, is it?

MR. RAY:

Justice O'Connor -There is a link there between an act
It isn't baking brownies

Justice O'Connor, you are correct.

coming before him.
QUESTION:

2

Well, but that's quite different from

3

linking it to an act performed or to be performed.

4

you want to say that anything given because the official

5

is an official is enough.
MR. RAY:

6

And

Only, Your Honor -- and that was why

7

we answered the question presented by the Court in -- in a

8

qualified way:

9

understood as the capacity to act, do we believe that

only when it is the official's position,

10

there is an equivalence, that they are coextensive with

11

one another.
QUESTION:

12

But isn't -- isn't the difficulty, or

13

one of the difficulties, for your position, at least with

14

respect to these instructions, that the judge, in giving

15

the instructions, went so far as to say that there --

16

literally, there need be no link with any act at all?

17

at that point, even assuming there's some -- there's some

18

merit to your argument, it seems to me, at that point, the

19

judge just totally untethered the -- the -- if you will,

20

the position from the -- from the capacity to act or the

21

anticipation of action.

22

accept your position, we -- wouldn't we have to find error

23

in -- in that instruction?

MR. RAY:
reason.

And

And -- and even if we were to

No, Justice Souter, for the following

link that came during the portion of the instruction where

2

the judge was making clear to the jury that this was not a

3

bribery offense.

The link being --

QUESTION:

(Laughter.)

6

QUESTION:

Well, he sure did that.

But, I mean, he went a lot further

7

than that, didn't he?

offense, as -- as we've described it, requires a -- a

9

fairly specific quid pro quo kind of link, specific act,

I mean, the bribery -- the bribery

10

specific gift.

11

be appropriate to distinguish this from the bribery

12

statute.

13

This went far beyond anything that would

MR. RAY:

Your Honor, but it was in the portion

14

of the charge where the judge was trying to explain to the

15

jury that no such link was required.

16

jury did not have to find that there was a particular

17

official act or a matter in mind at the time of the gift.

18
19

QUESTION:

That is, that the

But that isn't what he said.

He said

it doesn't have to be linked to any act.

20

MR. RAY:

Your Honor, our -- our position --

21

QUESTION:

Which -- which seems to go much

22

23

further.
MR. RAY:

Our position is that if it is the

24

prospect of official conduct that motivates the gift, it's

25

enough to find that to satisfy this offense.

To hold

otherwise -- that is, to distinguish between gifts given

2

for official acts in general --

QUESTION:

Well, I know that's your position,

4

but why does it make sense?

5

read a criminal statute to suddenly make a group of old-

6

age home residents decide to -- to send a little present

7

because they think the Senator has been generally in favor

8

of old-age homes?

9

That is to say, why should we

Or -- I mean, why should you have such an

10

expansive reading of a criminal statute when there are a

11

large number of ethics rules and other noncriminal matters

12

that adequately, at least arguably, control conduct like

13

this when it is unethical?

14

such broad discretion to prosecute people who may have

15

done things that are not even immoral?

16

general kind of question that I'd like you to address.

17

MR. RAY:

Why should we give prosecutors

That -- that's the

Let me answer the "why" question

18

first.

19

less offensive to integrity in government that gratuities

20

were given with a particular matter in mind, a whole

21

multitude of matters in mind, or no specific or any

22

official act in mind at the time of the gift, as long as

23

there is sufficient proof of motivation of the prospect of

24

official action; in other words, the prospect of official

25

conduct.

The "why" question is that it shouldn't be any

To answer your hypothetical, in that

1

2

hypothetical circumstance, it is our position that our

3

logic -- the logic to the "for or because of" official

4

position argument would be sufficient to encompass your

5

hypothetical if the motivation behind that gift was the

6

senior citizen offering a gift to a public official, in --

7

in that circumstance, because of the official's position

8

or, indeed, because of official action -- action with

9

respect to legislation that was of interest to that senior

10
11

citizen.
QUESTION:

Mr. --Mr. Ray, my -- my -- my

12

problem is just the opposite of -- of Justice Breyer's.

13

I -- I don't find it at all amazing that Congress should

14

seek to write a statute of the sort that you say this is.

15

And the reason I don't find it amazing is that they

16

already have, but in a different section of the United

17

States Code.

18

interpret a statute in such fashion as not to duplicate

19

something else that is already on the books.

20

And the problem is that we normally

How does this statute, as you interpret it,

21

differ from 5 U.S.C., Section 7353, which prohibits

22

Federal employees from accepting anything of value from

23

persons, quote, whose interests may be substantially

24

affected by the performance or nonperformance of the

25

individual's official duties?

That sounds like your --

6

7

the statute is simply asking there, as a fact, whether or

not those interests were ones before the public official.

It is not asking what the motivation was behind the gift.

MR. RAY:

No, Your Honor.

MR. RAY:

overlap from what 7353 invites, which is the passage of

21

regulations that deal in an administrative matter with

conduct of Federal employees.

include criminal prosecution.

2

QUESTION:

This is not a regulation.

I -- I can

3

understand how a regulation may go further than a statute,

4

and render any violation of the regulation automatically a

5

violation of the statute.

6

And it -- it -- since there is another way to read the

7

statute that -- that you're prosecuting under here, I'm --

8

I'm inclined to read it in such fashion that it will do

9

something different, insofar as the employee is concerned,

10
11

But this is another statute.

than 7353 does.
MR. RAY:

Your Honor, this statute, 5 U.S.C.,

12

7353, first of all, does not do anything other than

13

authorize the enactment or passage of Federal regulations

14

to deal with its -- its general conduct.

15

return to the answer to your question, why this is

16

different than Section 201, it is significantly different

17

because there is no criminal intent; there is no knowledge

18

requirement in this proscription, 7353.

19

But, again, to

Which is -- we believe, is the substantial

20

difference between what Congress had in mind in 1962, when

21

it passed 18 U.S.C., Section 201(c), which covers the

22

situation of a gratuities offense.

QUESTION:

Well, the other statute doesn't

purport to deal with donors, does it?
MR. RAY:

It does not, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

But -- but the point still remains,

such a large gap between the law and everyday practice?

12

MR. RAY:

Unless we're just

Your Honor, the only safe harbor that

13

is apparent with respect to prosecution under the Federal

14

gratuity statute, under our theory, again, is this

15

question of whether or not there's a gift given to a

MR. RAY:

QUESTION:

Correct, Your Honor.
All right.

So, this kind of area, I

gathered from what you prosecute, sometimes every public

official is sometimes invited to go on a trip, to speak to

people.

7

might -- and evidently, some of those things are sometimes

actually prosecuted.

difficulties in this area, assume that Congress intended

this general kind of present-giving; i.e., we invite you

11

on a trip to speak to a trade association, or give -- that

12

kind of thing should be handled by civil regulations

13

rather than somebody bringing the blunderbuss of the

14

criminal law in -- into the prosecutor's arsenal, where

15

they could prosecute trivial things?

They -- they might give him dinner.

Justice's broad sweep in interpretation to the 201

gratuity statute, consistent with the intent of Congress,

going back to the beginning, which was when it was passed

of value because of his official position, now, whether or

21

First, I had a question of how this charge came
to be.

Was this a result of a request to charge by the

prosecution?
MR. RAY:

Justice Ginsburg, it was.

But it --

it included, as part of that charge, both requests by the

government, as well as requests by the defendant.

QUESTION:

QUESTION:

By whom?

5

MR. RAY:

6

And with respect to that portion of the charge,

By the government.

7

the reason the government included it, Your Honor, is

8

because intent to influence is not an element of a

9

bribery - - of a gratuity offense.

It is, by contrast, an

10

element of a bribery offense, which is Section 201(b).

done the same thing using the words of the Act instead of

That's correct, we could have done

that.

18

say, Your Honor, that a -- an additional requirement

19

which, if you instruct in a fashion such as official acts,

20

begs the question about whether or not you're requiring,

21

for example, a specific official act to be shown.

22

believe no such requirement exists in the Federal

23

gratuities statute.

possible acts on the part of the official.
MR. RAY:
That's right.

You are correct, Mr. Chief Justice.

And it could have been -- we -- the

government could have talked in terms, and the district
judge could have talked in terms of acts rather than
position.
QUESTION:

But there is a difference, don't you

I mean, one could give a gratuity to somebody

because he just likes -- you know, who had no connection
with ag -- agriculture at all, just because he likes to
sit next to the Secretary at a football game or something
like that.

And I don't think that would come within the

language of the statute.

And yet that's given to him

because of his official position.
MR. RAY:

You are correct, Your Honor, it is not

within the language of the statute.

It is not our

position or the Department of Justice's position that that
would be included under our theory of the case under "for
or because of official position."

That, however, was not

presented by the facts of this case.

And it was not left

to the jury to simply speculate about what type of
official action they were to be concerned about.
In this case, the judge further instructed the
jury that the jury had to find official acts -- the

Well, may I ask you about your -- the

distinction that you are drawing on "intent to influence,"

10

because the plausibility of that distinction, it seems to

11

me, given the text of -- of 201, will vary greatly

12

depending on whether we use the word "acts" as our focus

13

or "position" as our focus.

14

the phrase -- what is it -- for -- for or because of -- if

15

we say that a -- a gift violates the statute if it's given

16

for or because of the position, then I think it follows

17

quite readily from what -- as you have been saying -- that

18

the notion of intent to influence is outside the statute;

19

it's not the focus of the statute.

20

MR. RAY:

QUESTION:

What I'm getting at is the --

Yes, Your Honor.
But if -- if we -- if we go back to

22

the original language, and we speak of for or because of

24

I -- I suppose, suggested by Judge Wald's remark, to think

25

of a gift that might plausibly be given for or because of

acts which wasn't intended to influence the way those acts

2

were performed.

Would you comment on that?

So, I guess my point is, if we -- if we accept

3
4

the equation of position and acts, then the notion of

5

intending to influence really does seem to drop out.

6

if we stick to the text, and we say "for or because of

acts, then the notion of intending to influence, it seems

8

to me, is rather hard to get out of the statute.

recognized the point, that inherent in a gift given in a

believe leads the jury astray.

any, even general intent, on the part of the donor to

performed his acts is totally irrelevant; would that be a

MR. BLOOM:

I strongly suspect that if I had

going to be terribly difficult for the prosecutor,

9

especially with the resources of the grand jury, to be

able to identify matters.

The second point --

QUESTION:

No, no.

Wait.

You have to take my

hypothetical.

MR. BLOOM:

No.

There is no

Our view is that the prosecutor

has to identify one or more acts for which the gifts are

given.

QUESTION:

Okay, we're back to the specific.

22

What's the difference between the one or more acts that

he's got to identify for the gratuity statute and the

MR. BLOOM:

That is correct.
All right.

And I think what you're

you don't get too explicit about the agreement under the

You keep saying "specific act."

You

keep using that term.

hypotheticals you're accepting do not have "specific act."

10

Would you tell me the difference between your position and

11

the position of the Department of Justice in their

12

separate brief?

13

MR. BLOOM:

Well, we certainly agree a lot with

14

the Department of Justice, in that it's generally a jury

15

matter to determine the issue of intent.

16

disagree with the Solicitor General, I could think of, in

17

three ways.

on the regulatory relationship only, a jury should be able

19

to infer guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

We probably

We agree that the substantiality of the gifts

and the fact that there are matters pending are in fact

22

factors for the -- for the jury to consider.

we can't decide in a vacuum whether or not that would be

sufficient from which a reasonable jury can find beyond a

reasonable doubt that gifts were given for or because of

I would prefer a broader charge,

that -- that instructs the jury --

QUESTION:

Well, I didn't ask whether you

preferred it; I asked if that would be a legally correct

15

charge?

16

MR. BLOOM:

It -- it may be.

I, frankly, think

17

it may be a bit prejudicial.

18

would suggest to the jury is that the jury may consider

19

the substantiality of the gifts, both to the donor and to

20

the donee, the substantiality of the interests to the

donor, the timing of the gifts vis-a-vis acts.

it seems to us that he equates capacity to act with act.

And I believe that capacity to act is an awful lot like

The third place where we disagree is

specifically on the -- whether or not the statute requires

a nexus to a particular act or just a general act.

from that, I think -QUESTION:

For example, I may want to

On that point, we don't have to agree

with you on that position to affirm the judgment below, do

MR. BLOOM:

14

QUESTION:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.
But let me get back to your -- what

15

you mean by "the nexus to the particular act."

16

guess I'm going back to Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.

If the --if the jury charge --if the judge charged the

following, would it be legally sufficient?

And I

In order to show that the gift was given for or

20

because of an official act, the government must prove that

21

the gift was given with an intent to influence the

22

performance of an official act.

23

necessarily, but you may find, on this evidence, that the

24

gift was so given because, at the time it was given, there

were two matters pending before the Secretary in which the

MR. BLOOM:

I suspect that the answer is yes.

7

But, to be candid, the converse of that question says,

8

could I, as a defendant, prevail on a Rule 29 motion?

9

I will tell you that I, as a defense counsel, would make a

10

very strong Rule 29 motion, based on the facts in this

11

case, that no rational trier of fact could find

12

Sun-Diamond guilty on this record.

QUESTION:

Why?

Make your argument.

Certainly.

There were two matters

that the government proved were pending.

The evidence was that Sun-Diamond

wanted the Secretary to adopt a definition of a small

MR. BLOOM:

The history, I

Okay.

That is correct.
I understand.
What I was going to go back to is

15

the issue of these two classes, and the fact that because

16

Sun-Diamond is a regulated entity, somehow we deserve a

17

different standard.

18

is create an impermissible irrebuttable presumption.

19

is, if the jury were to find -- and if the jury did

20

find -- that Sun-Diamond gave gifts for or because of any

21

official position, then the court, as a matter of law, was

22

saying, then Sun-Diamond must have given it for or because

of any official act.

offense beyond a reasonable doubt.
I wanted to go back, also to the issue of this

2

3

hierarchy of conduct.

Clearly, at the top of the

4

hierarchy is bribery.

Clearly, below that we have the

5

gratuity as a reward.

In our view, at the bottom is for

6

or because of an official position, which is governed, we

7

believe, administratively.
There is a question as to whether or not there

8

9

is a gap between bribery and the gratuity.

Does

10

bribery -- clearly, bribery covers improper attempts to

11

influence.

12

Clearly, gratuity covers the issue of rewards.
The difficult issue is whether or not there is a

13

gap that is filled by the gratuity statute.

14

why I'm partial to the language of the Court of Appeals

15

that says, essentially, we don't have to decide what the

16

bribery statute line is.

17

the gap will be filled by the gratuity statute.

18

And that's

But wherever we draw that line,

To conclude, we believe that the district court,

19

by instructing the jury that the government did not have

20

to prove that Sun-Diamond gave gifts for any act at all

21

stripped the jury of its fact-finding mission.

22

did not have an opportunity to decide the one question

23

that was crucial to this case.

relieved the government of its constitutional obligation
to prove every element of the offense beyond a reasonable
doubt.

That was error.

And for that reason, we therefore

ask for this Court to affirm the decision of the Court of
Appeals.
