ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL KELLOGG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. KELLOGG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question at issue in this case is whether

12

shareholders may appeal without formal intervention when a

13

district court approves a derivative suit settlement over

14

their objections.

15

We suggest that three characteristics combine in

16

this case to give the objecting shareholders such a right.

17

The first is that they receive notice pursuant

18

to rule 23.1 in the form of an order to show cause why the

19

settlement should not be approved.

20
21

22

Second, they appeared and litigated their
obj ections.
And third, they are bound by the judgment of the

23

district court; that is, they are subject to claim

24

preclusion.

25

When all three of those characteristics are

found, this Court's cases indicate that intervention is

2

not required in order to preserve a right to appeal.
QUESTION:

They litigated their -- what does

litigating their objections consist of?

their objections to the court.

Right?

That's true.

They did so both in

writing - QUESTION:

I mean, they weren't subject to

discovery or - - or to any of the other procedures that a
10
11

party is subject to.

Right?

MR. KELLOGG:

Not in this case, although a

12

district court judge could fashion a settlement hearing in

13

which he would allow some sort of discovery of the

14

objecting parties' experts or -- or some limited -- I

15

would think that -- that the court would have discretion

16

to do that in appropriate circumstances.

17

QUESTION:

But it doesn't follow automatically

18

from the fact that you submit that the other side is

1

entitled to treat you like a party.

20

MR. KELLOGG:

21

But what this Court's cases teach, starting with

That's correct.

That's correct.

22

Johnson v. Manhattan Railway, is that in appropriate

23

circumstances where you do appear and object and you have

24

a right to do so and you are bound by the judgment, that

25

you are entitled to appeal.

That was the holding of this

Federal rules were passed, and it has been the uniform

Circuit's decision in this case.

Now, the basic impulse behind that is the well-

7

established principle that only parties may be bound by a

Now, obviously there's an exception to that

10

shareholders.

But the only reason there is an exception

11

is because non-named shareholders and absent class members

12

are in a sense quasi parties.

13

under the Federal rules.

14

That is why they have a right to appear and object, and

15

that is why in our view they also enjoy the right to

16

appeal.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. KELLOGG:

They are treated as such

That is why they get notice.

What does a quasi party mean?
Well, quasi party means they are

19

not a formal party in the sense of names on the caption or

20

allowed to intervene pursuant to rule 24.

21

Court's cases in Blossom v. Milwaukee Railroad and

22

Williams v. Morgan have used the term quasi parties to

23

indicate somebody, in those instances generally a

24

bondholder objecting to a receivership -- to indicate

25

somebody who had a right to appear before the court and

was bound by the judgment, and therefore was -- was viewed

2

as having a right to appeal.

QUESTION:

That sounds like --

QUESTION:

Is there such a thing as intervening

5

just for the purpose of objecting to the settlement?

6

Could that -- has that happened in 23.1 cases where --

7

where objectors say, we want to intervene, Your Honor, but

8

not for the purpose of becoming a party to displace the

9

named representative, just to object to the judgment?
MR. KELLOGG:

10

It has happened.

It has been

11

allowed in some cases, though it's not clear quite how

12

that meshes with the language of rule 24 because rule 24

13

does not distinguish between intervening for some purposes

14

and intervening for others.

15

In fact, rule 24 and rule 23.1 do not mesh

16

particularly well together when they are superimposed upon

17

one another because, for instance,

19

rights are going to be adjudicated in this particular

20

instance.

21

under 24(a), you must show that you are not adequately

22

represented by existing parties.

24

adequately represented by the existing derivative suit

plaintiff.

MR. KELLOGG:

is litigating the case.

You can't appear and object if there's a litigated

It's only if there's a settlement

This Court's case in Phillips Petroleum v.
Shutts indicated that where you're going to be bound by

11

MR. KELLOGG:

QUESTION:

Well, in fact, rule --

I mean, you're right.

Congress has

provided the -- this -- this provision for notice, but

18

whether I should take that provision for notice so that

19

the person can come in and object to the settlement,

20

whether I should take that as amounting to a judgment by

21

Congress that this individual should be able to become a

22

party by doing that, for that purpose I -- I am - - I am

struck by the fact that there's no difference between the

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, in fact, Justice Scalia, I

A

think allowing objecting shareholders to appeal dovetails

5

very nicely with the clear legislative purposes and

6

policies behind rule 23.1.

7

objecting shareholders to appear and object to a

That would be correct.

If they

wanted to be a party for all purposes, if they wanted to

be able to litigate the case to judgment, they would have

to intervene.

But again, I would note that there is -- there

23

2

They're not named parties, but they're parties, as

3

distinguished from the 23.1 where the objector is not a

4

party.

5

MR. KELLOGG:

Well, no.

I would suggest that in

6

the 23.1 context, all the absent shareholders are equally

7

parties in the same sense that absent class members are

8

parties in the crucial sense that they will be bound by

9

the judgment of the court and any future claims they have

10

arising out of the same circumstances will be precluded.

11

If you look at the language of 23 and 23.1, they're quite

12

parallel in terms of the rights afforded to absent

shareholders.

QUESTION:

Well, they're bound, as a practical

matter, in not being able to have a new derivative suit I

MR. KELLOGG:

8

Before lunch, both Justice Ginsburg and Justice

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Kennedy expressed some concerns about whether a derivative

10

right, che rights of a derivative shareholder, are

11

sufficiently personal, sufficiently significant to fall

12

comfortably within the Court's line of cases allowing non-

13

parties to appeal.

14

crux of our argument, so I wanted to address that briefly.

And I think that really goes to the

15

In Hawes v. Oakland, when the Court first laid

16

down the principles for derivative suit settlements, the

17

Court explained that there are really two suits involved.

18

One, there's a suit by the shareholder against his

19

corporation for essentially having fallen down on the job.

20

And second, there's the suit by the shareholder in the

21

guise of the corporation against a third party who has

22

wronged the corporation.

23

And in that sense, in that important sense, the

24

right to bring a derivative action in appropriate

25

circumstances is a critical part of the bundle of rights

1

that a shareholder possesses, and that common law right

2

has been reinforced by the protections provided in rule

3

23.1, specifically notice and opportunity to appear and

4

object and the claim preclusion principles that have been

5

developed by the Court.

6

Now,

it's also important to recognize that

allowing objecting shareholders to appeal serves, as I
8

noted before lunch, the critical purposes underlying rule

9

23.1 of casting light on potentially collusive

10

settlements.

11

importance of objecting shareholders to give a sort of

12

adversarial context to what otherwise is a rather cozy

13

deal cut between the nominal plaintiff and their lawyers

14

and the corporation.

15

And court after court has emphasized the

And there are enormous practical disincentives

16

that will be created if shareholders have to go through

17

the hoops of intervention in order to bring those

18

objections to the notice of the courts because they'll be

19

subject to mandatory disclosure and discovery obligations

20

which could be used as a weapon to discourage objecting

21

shareholders and increase their costs.

22

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Kellogg, could they even

23

intervene of right under the conflict or the tension that

24

you mentioned before between rule 24 and 23.1?

25

MR. KELLOGG:

On the other hand, you

That's exactly right, and I don't

5

see how those two provisions mesh very well together.

6

you're going to say that you have to intervene in order to

appeal, you essentially have to displace the existing

MR. KELLOGG:

I think my point is that 23.1

3

gives us an absolute right to come in and object without

explain that the enforcement decrees, which we have

outlined in our brief, are fully suggestive that Congress

Now, I would like to address one last point that

19

Justice Scalia raised which was some difference between

20

why settlement would be different from litigating to

21

j udgment.

22

And the answer, Justice Scalia, is that

23

settlement is quite different because there is an absence

24

of an adversarial process when the settlement is brought

25

to the district court for approval.

And historically the

1

courts recognized that there was a potential conflict of

2

interest between the plaintiff shareholders who might: or

3

might not represent the views of all of the other
shareholders as it turned out for settlement and the

5

directors and officers and the nominal defendant

6

corporation which would seek to settle the claim.

7

that's why the provision for court approval was put into

8

the rule so that persons could state their objections to

9

the adequacy of the settlement.

And

That's very different from the adversarial

10
11

process that, of course, goes when the case and the

12

complaint go all the way through trial where the plaintiff

13

shareholders are contending that there was some action

14

that required jury findings and court rulings that would

15

go all the way to judgment.

this can go on endlessly.
MR. FREDERICK:

Well, in fact, as the empirical

experience would strongly suggest, Justice Scalia,

in the

uniform application of this rule up until the decision
below, that was not the experience.

And in fact, the rule

successive appeals is simply not a problem that bears any

That's correct, Justice Stevens.

Now, one last point I would like to make, which

7

is that the court of appeals seemed to confuse what the

proper standard for approving a settlement is.

9

could direct the Court's attention to page 6a of the

And if I

10

petition appendix, the court -- the court stated there

11

that rule 23.1 provides notice to shareholders only in the

12

event of dismissal or settlement so that other investors

13

may contest the faithfulness or honesty of the self-

14

appointed plaintiffs.

15

Our concern, from the perspective of the Federal

16

Government's interest, is that that error gravely

17

misstated what the standard is for approving a settlement

18

and that if that standard is applied, it really will

19

confuse the distinctions between rule 23.1 and 24 in a way

20

that would make very difficult for the adequacy of

settlements that are simply based on their economic terms.

whether it was an abuse of discretion to deny
