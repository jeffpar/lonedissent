The tort of

QUESTION:

They

Well, supposing Congress had never

8

passed the Lanham Act but just felt that organizations

9

such as yours were put at a considerable disadvantage by

10

the sovereign immunity doctrine of the States.

11

Congress have stepped in and said these are property

12

rights created by State law but we don't think the States

13

adequately protect even when they have sovereign immunity?

14

MR. TODD:

Could

That is our position, yes, Mr. Chief

15

Justice, that the fact is that Congress can step in,

16

having determined that the State remedies are genuinely

17

inadequate and that there is a need to foster interstate

18

commerce, the commerce of this country, for there to be a

19

Federal standard governing these matters.

20

QUESTION:

But you're in trouble, I think, if

21

you say it's based on interstate commerce, because we've

22

held that Congress can't abrogate sovereign immunity under

it's commerce power.

This Court has found that it is for Congress, at

least in the first instance, to determine whether and what

It is

Well, Mr. Todd, that assumes, I take

10

it, that the right to be free from unfair competition is a

11

property right to be protected.

MR. TODD:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

QUESTION:

But it certainly is not like any

14

traditional property right.

you suppose?

Well, can you exclude others from a

from anything we would think of as a property right.

5

MR. TODD:

Justice O'Connor, I think in the

6

first case I would again like to reiterate that this Court

7

has never held a particular set of attributes that must be

8

met in order for a particular interest to be called

9

property.

They have held welfare benefits to be property,

10

a cause of action to be property, a horse trainer's

11

license to be property.

12
13

Many of these things are obviously not
alienable, and you cannot use the term, right to exclude,
as a part of any description of those property rights

15

which have clearly been held to be property rights within

16

the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.

17

QUESTION:

But those things were all things that

belonged to the person asserting the right.

property right.

21

nothing has stopped your client here from doing business.

your business, but there are a lot of businesses where

In the case of McDaniels v. Williams,

where the prisoner falls down the stairway and there's a

question of whether there's a constitutional tort, we said

that the Constitution, and the Fourteenth Amendment

particularly, concerns the large concerns of governance,

11

and that it is not designed to supplant tort law.

12

seems to me that the same observation could be made with

reference to your case.

1

concerned to be a tort that is actionable within the

2

concepts of tort law but not under the Constitution.
MR. TODD:

3

I would suggest two things, that I

4

think that this Court clearly has found -- they have never

5

found a case -- I have no case specifically on point.

6

However, this Court has found that this kind of a right

7

represents a property right, the International News

8

Service.

9

The position of petitioner is that a property

10

right is a property right, and it is not constitutionally

11

permissible to begin parsing property rights which are

12

protectable under the Fourteenth Amendment and property

13

rights which are not protectable, and to say that a

14

business is property standing alone really doesn't mean

15

anything unless you can give some enforcement power to

16

that concept.

17

A business is obviously more than a building and

18

desks and chairs.

19

going concern value, and a business as a property right is

20

meaningless unless there is the ability to protect that

21

business from this kind of injury.

and services is identical to the harm caused by a

misrepresentation of the competitor's -QUESTION:

9

It may be, but is it a deprivation of

10

property?

I assume, then, that if it's a deprivation of

11

property, in addition to being a tort, it would be some

12

sort of larceny.

13

on a criminal charge for misrepresenting his product,

14

because he's taken away some of your property.

You ought to be able to get this fellow

MR. TODD:

15

Well, Justice Scalia, with respect,

16

there is nothing in the jurisprudence in this Court which

17

suggests that property interests are limited to those

18

things which would be deemed to be larceny if stolen.

19

Welfare benefits, a horse trainer's license, and a

20

driver's license aren't property interests -- are property

21

interests, but they're not susceptible to that kind of a

22

test.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

11

"*\

MR. TODD:

GENERAL WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In Parden v. Terminal Railway all nine Justices

12

agreed that at least where Congress has made its intent

13

clear the voluntary participation by a State in a

14

commercial business that has traditionally been engaged in

15

not by States but rather by private parties for profit

16

will establish consent to private suits out of that

17

business in Federal court.

18

QUESTION:

This case --

General Waxman, most constitutional

19

rights where you talk about waiver, it requires a very

20

explicit, fully informed waiver, which I don't think what

21

you just described would meet that test, do you?

22

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I think -- I don't, and I think

23

that the -- well, to the extent that Congress has made its

24

intent clear is where that test is met.

25

the abrogation context in Atascadero and in the Parden

(202)289-2260
(800) FOR DEPO

This Court, in

1

waiver context in Welch v. Texas Transportation made it

2

clear that in order for there to be a loss by a State of

3

its constitutional Eleventh Amendment right, the national

4

legislature must speak with unmistakable clarity.

>

5

Now, waiver and abrogation are sometimes

6

confused and, before this Court's decision in Seminole

7

Tribe, it's understandable why they were, but they're very

8

different concepts, as we think this Court recognized in

9

Seminole Tribe.

Abrogation is the unilateral act of power

10

by the national legislature, acting within its

11

constitutional scope.

12

Waiver requires the voluntary consent of the

13

State, whether it's waiver by express language, or waiver

14

by conduct and, Mr. Chief Justice, the act of waiver

15

following notice must be such that it reflects a voluntary

16

knowing waiver of a constitutional right.

17

agree with that.

18

QUESTION:

We definitely

General Waxman, do you really think

19

there's a difference between what you call a unilateral

20

act of the Government, the Government saying, the State

21

shall be liable for any damages arising from its operation

22

of a railroad -- unilaterally, the State's liable if it

23

operates a railroad -- and the Government saying on the

24

other hand, the State shall be liable for any damages from

8

If you want to operate
We're not acting

You waived it by operating a railroad.

GENERAL WAXMAN:

The test -- there is a

distinction between unilateral abrogation and consent, and
the test really boils down to, as it does in the Tenth

10

Amendment cases this Court has decided, like FERC v.

11

Mississippi and United States v. New York, in terms of

12

whether the State is exercising a genuine, reasonable

13

choice and is not being coerced.

14

Now, in the specific context of the Eleventh

15

Amendment, where this Court has always recognized the

16

viability and applicability of the concept of waiver and

17

consent, this Court, subsequent to Parden, in Missouri

18

Employees qualified Parden in the way in which I just

1

articulated.

20

That is, it's not just, if you run a railroad,

21

or if you choose to run a railroad, it's that the Parden

22

doctrine, that is, voluntariness will be imputed and

23

applied to the State if what the State -- if the activity

24

is not something that States traditionally has done but

25

instead is something that private parties have done and

for profit.

That's the test that we understand this Court

2

substituted for Parden and therefore qualified Parden in

Missouri Employees.

QUESTION:

Is there a third --

5

QUESTION:

General Waxman, I was surprised that

6

we're talking throughout about consent, which is to some

7

extent a fiction, and you didn't make an argument that I

8

thought you might have made, which was, there's no

9

sovereign immunity here at all.

10

After all, with respect to foreign countries we

General Waxman -I think, Justice Scalia, if I

can just respond to you for a moment, I think there are

9

some important bedrock principles in the law that this

Court has recognized that doesn't require any stretching

11

for this Court to say that the Parden doctrine as a

concept of waiver by consent with adequate notice and

truly voluntary conduct is not one that should be

abandoned.

15

There are perhaps more difficult questions about

GENERAL WAXMAN:

I think for me at least a

useful way of thinking about the continuity of the Parden

those cases themselves.
