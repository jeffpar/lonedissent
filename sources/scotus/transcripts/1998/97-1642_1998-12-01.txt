ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. LAMKEN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

12

MR. LAMKEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For well over a century, it has been settled law

13

that no plaintiff may obtain money from the United States

14

Treasury absent an act of Congress entitling the plaintiff

15

to the money or creating the -- or authorizing the

16

creation of a right to that money.

17

repeatedly recognized in this Court's cases, including

18

Buchanan v. Alexander, United States v. Nordic Village,

19

United States v. Testan, OPM v. Richmond, and Republic

20

National Bank.

That rule has been

21

Probably nowhere has that rule been more often

22

repeated than in the context of subcontractor efforts to

23

obtain payment from the United States under an equitable

24

lien theory when the prime contractor that should have

25

paid this prime contract -- the subcontractor does not.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Lamken, I note you're getting

2

down to this specific case, but for the broad, sweeping

3

proposition you announced originally, I'm thinking of

4

cases like Westcott v. Califano where Congress said

5

benefits go to fathers not mothers, and this Court said

6

that such a statute -- its constitutionality could be

7

saved by including mothers for benefits, for unemployment

8

compensation benefits.

9

that unless there's a specific act that covers this, no

10
11

How does that fit with your theory

money will be paid from the Treasury?
MR. LAMKEN:

Well, Your Honor, I would say that

12

in that case the Court was construing the statute in a

13

manner to save its constitutionality consistent with

14

Congress' purpose.

15

exclude somebody that the Court thought was

16

constitutionally included -- constitutionally had to be

17

included in the category, then the answer would be that

18

the statute could not be enforced at all.

19

not blue pencil in against Congress' intent a category of

20

people or an entitlement to money that Congress did not

21

want to be entitled.

22

categorized as a case where the Court construed the

23

statute in order to make it constitutional and therefore

24

it read the statute as providing for a payment to those

25

individuals.

If Congress' express purpose was to

The Court could

So, that would have to be

QUESTION:

1

That's something maybe a lawyer could

2

follow, but the statute said unemployed father and the

3

Court said unemployed mothers will be paid under this

4

statute as well.
MR. LAMKEN:

5

Yes.

It's possible, Your Honor,

6

that the Court stretched quite a bit to save the

7

constitutionality of that statute.

8

change the underlying principle that absent a statute,

9

nobody may obtain money from the -- from the public

But that does not

10

Treasury, and the courts are not entitled under principles

11

of common law or equity to create entitlements.

12

The other difference --

13

QUESTION:

But you could have that kind of loose

14

interpretation of a statute that would accommodate the

15

kind of case I just described.
*

MR. LAMKEN:

16
17
18

I'm sorry.

Could you repeat the

question?
QUESTION:

You could -- you said absent a

19

statute, but you just described a statute that on its face

20

doesn't cover something, but will be construed by a court

21

to cover something and that fits within your theory.

22

MR. LAMKEN:

I think it would, but there's

23

another point to it, which is when we say that absent a

24

statute, we include in statutes all positive sources of

25

law that are above common law and court-made law and we

1

would include the Constitution.

2

required a payment from the United States Treasury -- and

3

I think it would be rare that it would.

4

Constitution required a payment from the United States

5

Treasury, then the Court might have it within its power to

6

order that payment be made.
QUESTION:

8

If the

No such problem is raised -- involved

here, is it?
MR. LAMKEN:

9
10

So, if the Constitution

No, I don't believe that there is

any constitutional question in this case.
QUESTION:

11

In this -- in this case before the

12

Army paid Verdan in 1994, could it have said, you know, we

13

have $86,000 we're going to pay Verdan, but we have notice

14

that Blue Fox hasn't been paid?

15

money into a -- a court escrow account and -- and allow

16

Blue Fox to make its claim in court.

17

that?
MR. LAMKEN:

18

We're going to put this

Could you have done

The -- the Army could not have done

19

that without declaring the prime contractor in default.

20

So long as the contract was in force, it was contractually

21

obligated to pay the prime contractor.

22

that the prime contractor was in default because it had

23

failed to pay Blue Fox, then it could proceed with the

24

contract.

25

and if at the end of the day there was money left over on

If it had decided

It would hire a replacement prime contractor,

the contract that was owed to the prime contractor, it

2

could satisfy the contractual obligation to pay the

3

original prime contractor for the work it did by filing

QUESTION:

contractor was in default because it didn't post a bond?

7

MR. LAMKEN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

But couldn't they have said the

Pardon?
Could not the contractor have been in

default for failure to post a bond under the Miller Act?
MR. LAMKEN:

That's an interesting theory.

11

Because the contract itself did not require a Miller Act

12

bond -- in fact, the requirement of a bond had been

13

deleted -- it would have been I think another stretch to

14

suggest that the contractor had breached a condition of

15

the contracp --

16
17

QUESTION:

Not as much as the stretch as that

case was, though.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. LAMKEN:

20

QUESTION:

I -- I think -Because it's clear they -- oh, you

21

did dispute at one time whether there was a bond

obligation, didn't you?

MR. LAMKEN:

The district court specifically

found that there was no bond required.

decision, it's fair to assume that there was a bond

requirement and that it was improper to have deleted it.

QUESTION:

Well, wasn't Verdan in default for

not having paid Blue Fox?
MR. LAMKEN:

That is a possibility that Verdan

was in default for the --of the contract conditions by

not paying by - - Blue Fox in a timely fashion.

8

10

QUESTION:

But, I mean, it all depends on

whether you declare there's a default?
MR. LAMKEN:

That's correct.

The contract --

11

the Government has the -- the ability and oftentimes the

12

duty to overlook minor defaults in the contract to make

13

sure that the contract is completed in a timely fashion.

14

So, it has the option sometimes of declaring a default,

15

replacing the prime contractor, oftentimes at greater

16

expense, or it may overlook minor defaults, complete the

17

contract to the best of its ability.

QUESTION:

Well, if you -- if you have the --

19

the discretion -- let's assume there were facts here that

20

would have allowed you to declare a default -- to pay the

money into -- into a fund where interpleader is allowed,

which is ultimately going to allow Blue Fox to -- to

So, you -- could you have paid Blue

The United States could not

The only possible cases I could think of that

we would have difficulty in accepting your -- your very

The first is in Bowen the Court had no reason to

Well, of course, that's -- that's

very true, but the -- the fact is that the only language

that -- that Congress used in -- in -- in the section 702

MR. LAMKEN:

Justice Souter, no, I don't think

4

And I think, for example, United States v. Testan is a

very good example of that.

6

And that is a leap that you cannot make.

In Testan, the statute specifically stated that

7

the Court of Claims would have jurisdiction to enter

judgments on claims against the United States based on,

9

among other things, statutes.

This Court held that as a

10

matter of sovereign immunity, the Government's immunity to

11

suit, the ability to haul the United States into court,

12

had been waived, but if the statute did not take the

13

further step of creating a right to money from the United

14

States based on any particular statute.

15

-- if there.was a simple statutory violation, the Court of

not otherwise authorized by statute or only an equitable

right which would require the payment of money?
MR. LAMKEN:

14

I think, Your Honor, that section

702 does not authorize the courts to create any

substantive rights at all.

17

QUESTION:

So, the answer would be no equitable

MR. LAMKEN:

mistake we believe the Ninth Circuit made.

It read

section 702 as an implied authorization, and it doesn't

have any language that would suggest it's an implied

10

It stands in contrast to example -- to the Federal Tort

that right, the principal doesn't, or we'd have to decide

11

whether that right really exists or not before we could

see, there is one out there independently of 702.

702 is whether this right, which the Court of Claims says

rather to assert a claim for the thing itself, namely the

All we're seeking -- and this what distinguishes

22

if that fund existed, the later disbursement of the fund

doesn't matter because equity presumes to have been done

what should have been done, and therefore it reconstitutes

the fund.

argues, well, 702 may waive sovereign immunity for

there has to be a source of law somewhere.

The Court of Claims

So, the Pearlman claim is not

MR. SPAULDING:

So --

It does not arise out of a contract.

QUESTION:

By operation of what law?

MR. SPAULDING:

It arises out of the subrogation

I don't see anything in the history of

702 that indicates Congress was thinking about, yes, this

MR. SPAULDING:

4

Well, that was the whole point

that Congress used the more limiting words, money damages,

as opposed to monetary relief in 702.

And there's a lot of discussion there about the

5

-- the two major waivers for money damages, the tort

look at those -- look at the legislative history and say

what -- what Congress had in mind was simply we're not

here is going to give something that the Tort Claims Act

forbids, for example, misrepresentation claims, or nothing

12

gives what - - what the Court of Claims could give under

13

the Tucker Act, for example.

14

But by using the term money damages rather than

15

monetary relief, Congress made very clear that there can

16

be kinds of what Judge Bork called in the Maryland case

specific monetary relief, which is transfers of money from

MR. SPAULDING:

I -- I know, but Your Honor,

it's interesting because even in the view of the

opinion, everybody agreed that the Court would have

jurisdiction as to prospective economic relief.

of the Justices involved were in agreement as to that

So - - so, as to the point -- specific point,

12

here, if we go back to when my client wrote the letter as

13

to a request to enjoin enforcement or dissipation of those

14

monies, I think even under the dissenting opinion in

Bowen, we wouldn't have that problem because we're talking

16

about prospective monetary relief, and that's not damages

under any of the Justice's versions of -- in Bowen.

18

QUESTION:

But if Bowen applies here, then Bowen

19

applies in 702, et cetera, applies whenever there's a

20

specified fund of money that the Government has.

21

that's so, then many Court of Claims cases -- many,

22

perhaps most -- will suddenly be dissipated throughout the

23

9 or 10 or 12 or 13 circuits, and there goes the exclusive

jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, which seems

counterproductive.

MR. LAMKEN:

The basic principle that we believe

should control this case is that anybody seeking money

from the United States must show a waiver of immunity and

17

a substantive source of law applicable to the United

States giving them a right to the money.

19

In our view, neither section 702 nor Pearlman

MR. LAMKEN:
