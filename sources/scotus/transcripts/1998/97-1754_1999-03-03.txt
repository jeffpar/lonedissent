CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

Naturalization Service v. Juan Anibal Aguirre.

MS. MILLETT:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICIA A. MILLETT

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. MILLETT:

11
12

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the Immigration and Nationality Act, Congress

13
14

expressly invested in the Attorney General the authority

15

to determine whether an alien who has committed a serious,

16

nonpolitical crime should be denied withholding of

17

deportation.

18

Attorney General has serious reasons for considering that

19

such a crime occurred, the bar on withholding is

20

mandatory.

21

Congress further made clear that once the

The issue in this case is whether the Attorney

22

General, through the Board of Immigration Appeals, had

23

serious reasons for considering that respondent's acts of

24

burning buses, destroying private stores, and hitting,

25

binding, and stoning innocent civilians constituted

serious nonpolitical crimes.
QUESTION:

What, by the way, if you have a

3

chance, are we supposed to do about the fact that the

4

individual now says that isn't a correct translation; he

5

didn't stone any individuals.

6

stones against the side of the bus or something to stop

7

the bus, but they didn't actually throw stones at

8

individuals, which might be important.

9

about that?

10

MS. MILLETT:

What he said was, he threw

What should we do

First of all, we disagree it is

11

important, but even if the Court considered that it was,

12

the respondent has filed a motion to remand with the Board

13

of Immigration Appeals and, I think consistent with this

14

Court's decision in Stone v. INS, this Court can go ahead

15

and proceed to review the judgment that's before it and

16

allow that motion to proceed on its own track.

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Well, this tape question is a very

late-in-the-day thing, is it not?
MS. MILLETT:

It most certainly is.

It didn't

20

appear until the brief in opposition in this Court, and

21

that was --

22

QUESTION:

It wasn't presented to the Ninth

Circuit at all.
MS. MILLETT:

Not at all, even though the same

counsel represented Mr. Aguirre there, but that -- again,

the motion is pending before the Board of Immigration

Appeals.

3

Court's resolution of this case, or ability to proceed and

4

decide this case.

We believe it should have no impact on this

5

QUESTION:

Now, it is suggested by the

6

respondent that somehow the board's and the Government's

7

interpretation of the statutory standard differs in some

8

way from that recommended pursuant to the convention and
the protocol that bind other nations generally.

10

MS. MILLETT:

11

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

The language in the convention and

12

protocol looks about the same, but they say the Handbook

13

somehow establishes a more egregious standard.

14

other countries interpreted the protocol and the

15

convention, do we know?

16

MS. MILLETT:

How have

In this particular regard, on the

17

question of balancing the risk of persecution there are a

18

couple of other things --

1

QUESTION:

20

MS. MILLETT:

Uh-huh, yes.
-- the Ninth Circuit required that

21

haven't, as far as we know, been addressed by other

22

countries.

23
24
25

But on the question of balancing the risk of
persecution -QUESTION:

Yes.

there are two courts that have

MS. MILLETT:

1

2

directly ruled on it, and they are split.

3

court applied the balancing test that is recommended in

4

the Handbook, without saying that it was compelled, but

5

choosing to apply it.
The British House of Lords has held that the

6

7

The Canadian

balancing test does not apply, so we have a one-one split.
The respondent -- or, I'm sorry, the United

8

Nations High Commissioner in his amicus brief also cites a
10

decision from the French Commissioner of Refugees in a

11

case called Pham, P-h-a-m.

12

first of all, has been vacated, and secondly did not

13

address the serious nonpolitical crime exception.

14

addressed Article 33's particularly serious crime of

15

sexual --

16

QUESTION:

That case, however, did not --

It

Is that question, whether there are

17

serious reasons for considering that a particular offense

18

qualifies as serious and nonpolitical, is that a question

1

of fact or law, do you think?

20

MS. MILLETT:

Well, it has two tiers.

Whether

21

the test the Attorney General has adopted for identifying

22

serious nonpolitical crimes could, of course, be reviewed

23

for whether -- its consistency with the statute, but

24

because of the language that the Attorney General may

25

determine, and because of the serious reasons for

1

considering language, that would be an extremely

2

deferential review.
If the test is legally correct, then the

3
4

application of any facts in the record in a given case

5

would be -- against that test would be reviewed for

6

substantial evidence.

7
8

QUESTION:

Is the U.N. convention binding on the

United States?
MS. MILLETT:

The convention is not.

The

10

proto -- the United States is a party to the protocol

11

relating to the status of refugees, and that has

12

incorporated virtually all of the provisions of the

13

convention, including this definition of refugee,

14

which includes -- this portion of its definition of

15

refugee, which includes a serious nonpolitical crime

16

exception.

17

original limitations, original European limitations on the

18

definition of refugee.

1
20
21

The only thing that is not carried over is the

QUESTION:

Is the Handbook incorporated in the

protocol?
MS. MILLETT:

No, it is not.

In fact, we --

22

nothing -- nothing in the text of the protocol or the

23

convention mentions, let alone compels, balancing the risk

24

of persecution.

25

QUESTION:

Nor in our statute.

Is that protocol

1

self-executing?
MS. MILLETT:

2

No, it is not, and so even -- I

3

guess even if it did, if the Attorney General's reasonable

4

interpretation was that that had not been effectuated via

5

United States law, again that would not become -QUESTION:

6

We need a statute that implements it.

7

If we don't have a statute that says you take into account

8

the degree of persecution that will be received at home,
then there just isn't a statute that does that.

10

MS. MILLETT:

11

QUESTION:

Absolutely, although again --

The protocol doesn't do that either,

12

does it?

13

balancing test, so there's no inconsistency.

14

statute seems to be very close to the protocol.

15

isn't a significant difference between those two.

16

It's just the Handbook that sets up this

MS. MILLETT:

In fact, our
There

No, there is absolutely no, as we

17

see, tension between the protocol or the convention and

18

the United States law and the Attorney General's

1

interpretation of that.

20

are inconsistent with a recommendation in a Handbook

21

written by the United Nations High Commissioner of

22

Refugees.

23

QUESTION:

24

MS. MILLETT:

25

The only question is whether we

Why is that a question at all?
Because that's what the Ninth

Circuit relied on.

QUESTION:

Oh.

2

MS. MILLETT:

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION:

5

MS. MILLETT:

It's not our question.

Well -We, in fact, agree and think it

6

should not be a question.

The Attorney General was, of

7

course, entitled to give that document weight if she

8

chooses in interpreting the statute, but is not bound by

9

it.

10

QUESTION:

Well, now, as I understand the --

11

QUESTION:

Go on.

12

QUESTION:

As I understand the respondent, they

13

say, well, you can't really talk about McMullen

14

proportionality, the seriousness of the crime in light of

15

the political objectives, if you don't also talk about

16

persecution, which I take it you're going to tell us is a

17

non sequitur, or --

18

MS. MILLETT:

Yes, that would be our position.

19

The test for a serious nonpolitical crime and

20

the proportionality test that that applies are tests that

21

focus on the character of the crime itself.

22

Whether someone later faces a risk of

23

persecution for protected status or protected conduct has

24

no bearing on whether an earlier committed crime had a

25

serious nonpolitical character.

It either was or was not

1

a serious nonpolitical crime when it was committed, and

2

the fact that a risk of persecution materializes doesn't

3

change that.

4

QUESTION:

Why not?

That is to say, why -- you

5

might think -- normally words in statutes have a context,

6

and suppose a person -- your idea is you're just going to

7

list every crime in the U.S. Code and put it on two lists,

8

it's serious or not serious.

9

Well, I -- why wouldn't you in this kind of

10

situation, where you say a person, let's say, has a minor

11

drug offense that you might consider serious.

12

doesn't it make a difference whether we consider it

13

serious for the purpose of the statute, whether that's

14

seriousness because you called it that, it's so serious

15

that it means the person will be sent back to the same

16

country where he'll be killed immediately, as compared

17

with, he'll be sent back to the same country rather than a

18

different country, where he will serve 1 day's

19

imprisonment ?

20

Well,

I mean, I might think -- you tell me -- if this

21

person's going to be killed because I have to send him

22

back to the same country, I don't think that that previous

23

marijuana crime is such a big deal.

24

we're going to send him back to the same country rather

25

than a different country, and all that will happen, he'll

spend 7 hours in a cell, I'll say, well, okay, I'll give

2

it to you.

3
4

I mean, why not make that kind of all-factors
considered?

5

You're doing that with nonpolitical.

MS. MILLETT:

The first thing to keep in mind

6

is, the question in this case is whether the Attorney

7

General is compelled by the statute or the convention to

8

adopt that approach.

Whether or not one thinks it would

be a good approach to adopt, she most definitely is not,
10

in our opinion, by the text, legislative history, drafting

11

history of either the statute or the convention and

12

protocol.

13

The second thing to keep in your mind is, you

14

mentioned the history of terms.

15

crime does have a history.

16

immigration -- I'm sorry, in international law and in

17

extradition law, and the balancing that the Attorney

18

General has used to identify whether something is

political or nonpolitical draws upon that history, but it

20

is still -- both of them are describing the crime itself.

crime.

nonpolitical crime --

25

It's a term with meaning in

The question is whether it's a serious

Ms. Millet, may I clarify -- ask you

to clarify one thing, because I think when Justice Breyer

1

said, it's just you list everything in the U.S. Code as

2

serious or not serious, do I understand correctly that in

3

defining what is a nonpolitical crime, that the Attorney

4

General is in sync with the Handbook, that the dissonance

5

comes up only at the tail end on the question of, do you

6

then balance against the risk of persecution.

7
8

But I thought in defining what is a nonpolitical
crime it isn't simply a matter of going through the U.S.
Code and saying this is serious and this is less serious.
MS. MILLETT:

10

No, that is correct.

That is

11

correct, and sometimes the analysis of serious and

12

nonpolitical can overlap, but it's -- as I explained, the

13

term nonpolitical and the definition that the Attorney

14

General has adopted is consistent with the Handbook, is

15

consistent with the Ninth Circuit's at least prior

16

articulation --

17
18

QUESTION:

But the Attorney General rejects the

gross disproportionality test, as I understand it.

MS. MILLETT:

The Attorney General rejects the

20

notion that things have to be tantamount to atrocious

21

conduct.

MS. MILLETT:

1

2

Yes.

That is how we interpreted

that.

3

QUESTION:

Ms. Millett, do I have to give the

4

Attorney General's interpretation deference if I think the

5

Attorney General's interpretation may be wrong for a

6

reason quite different from the reason that respondent

7

here says?
Specifically, I don't care what the Handbook

8

says.

I care what Congress passed and what the fair

10

meaning of our statute is.

11

it quite incredible that we are adopting an interpretation

12

that takes into this country people who commit any crime

13

at all, even murder, so long as it's for a political

14

reason, and so long as it's not disproportionate.

15

And, frankly, when I -- I find

Now, there's a totally different reading of

16

political -- non -- I mean, I've never heard nonpolitical

17

crime.

18

normal understanding of a political crime is a crime whose

1

definition -- it's not the motivation of the criminal in

20

committing a murder.

21

the crime is a political crime, such as the law in Cuba

22

under which some journalists have just gone to jail

23

because they criticized the Government in the press, a law

24

that prohibits criticism of the Government, perhaps a law

25

that prohibits -- even a law that prohibits treason.

It's the opposite of a political crime.

And my

It's rather, the very definition of

SUITE 400

But when you're committing a crime that is

1

2

independently criminal -- murder, rape, whatever -- the

3

fact that you're doing it for a political motive, why

4

should that make any difference as to whether we want

5

those people in this country?

6

to be done for political motives in this country.

7

want to admit immigrants who have that philosophy?
MS. MILLETT:

8

9
10
11

We don't allow those things
Do we

Well, that is a choice again for

Congress and the executive branch, particularly Congress
to make.
QUESTION:

Well, all Congress said was,

12

nonpolitical crime, and that's a perfectly reasonable

13

interpretation of what a political crime consists of.

14

fact, I think it's the more normal one.

15

know, well, I murdered somebody, but it was proportionate.

16

It was really sort of necessary for my political goal.

17

We're admitting people on those bases?

18

MS. MILLETT:

In

It's not, you

The question would be if -- the

19

way in which that would come up, and sometimes there are

20

things that are so -- how serious it is can be factored

21

into whether or not it can even be accepted as

22

nonpolitical.

23

nonpolitical is a contextual inquiry, and the more drastic

24

means that are employed is often a factor.

25

Again, the history of the term political or

succeeded, would not necessarily have to be excluded from

a country under this definition.

What about Lee Harvey Oswald, who

I don't think that would be the

extraordinary, you shouldn't interpret the statute that

1

MS. MILLETT:

2

QUESTION:

I'm having a little --

Have we rewarded the enemies of our

3

side, for example, during the Cold War -- when the

4

Attorney General looks to what is, let's say, the

5

political motivation, the political side of the equation,

6

does the Attorney General simply count as political those

7

political objectives which are acceptable to the

8

Government of the United States at the time?

9

MS. MILLETT:

It's a larger inquiry than that,

10

and for example, with the hypothetical about Queen

11

Elizabeth, the Attorney General will also consider the

12

structure of the country in which -- first of all, we

13

The motivation, is it the motivation required

in this contextual inquiry on the nature, of whether

the crime, and one factor that has been critically

important in that analysis historically, and is now for

the Attorney General, is whether civilians have been the

question is, given that nonpolitical status of the crime,

I thought that's what this case was about.

MS. MILLETT:

Well, there were a couple of

other -- it's not absolutely clear to me where the other

4

two factors of the Ninth Circuit mentioned the

5

atrociousness and the necessity and success, where they

6

come into this calculus.

7

balancing the risk of persecution, it's only been argued

8

about deciding whether or not it's serious.

But certainly on a question of

And again, our position is not only that it is
10

not compelled in any means by the statutory language,

11

indeed it's a strained one, but also to keep in mind that

12

adopting such a balancing test would result in a

13

complicated matrix of withholding judgments under which

14

you're going to be having varying degrees of seriousness

15

of the crime weighed against varying gradations of actual

16

threats to life and liberty, and the nature of those

17

judgments reviewed by courts all over the country.

18

the Attorney General has determined that not -- because

it's not compelled by the language, she elects not to

impose that interpretive and administrative thicket on the

withholding provision.

QUESTION:

May I ask you this question about the

12

The BIA stated in a rather conclusory way that

here the, let's say the political character of the crime

14

was outweighed by its seriousness, which it described as

15

being great enough to come to the attention of the warring

16

or the contending parties in Guatemala, which sounds to me

17

as though it's saying, whenever the crime, given its

18

political motivation, is effective in getting the

1

attention of the political contenders, they've gone too

20

far, that the criminality by definition at that point

21

outweighs whatever political character they might have --

22

it might have.

nothing fails like success, seems to be the reasoning of

the BIA here.

The board -- the immigration judge held that it

it did not apply the five factors of the McMullen test, it
only concluded as to one factor.

10

QUESTION:

I really find that difficult to

follow, because the McMullen test was a test that was said

on the way to saying that the applicant there did not

qualify for any dispensation.

that it was one that followed the language of the statute.

Right.
But Your Honor, that's all they

They just simply announced it, and they violated

10

another cardinal principle of administrative law that the

agency is supposed to show that it reasoned and not merely

reacted, and here the agency just simply concluded, so it

isn't as if they overturned McMullen, or -- they purported

to apply McMullen, but they did not adequately apply --

15

they did not --

QUESTION:

Well, have we applied some special

to explain it, or can they just determine the facts, and

do we owe some deference to that factual determination?

MS. WETTSTEIN:

Well, Your Honor, in this case,

21

certainly if they had properly applied the tests they

would have reached a separate -- a different result.

determination.

QUESTION:

Well, advert if you will for a minute

8

to what the Ninth Circuit said.

You -- in the first

9

place, I guess the third reason for which the Ninth

10

Circuit thought there had been error was the failure to

11

consider the seriousness of the persecution.

12

you mentioned earlier that McMullen didn't involve that,

13

so that's an open question so far as McMullen goes.

14

MS. WETTSTEIN:

15

QUESTION:

And I think

That's right.

And quite obviously the board did not

16

in this case think that whatever the relevance of that

17

factor might be, if relevant at all, would have been in

18

favor of your client.

19

Go to the second -- I think it was the second

20

reason that the Ninth Circuit gave, and that was that the

21

board had failed to consider the possibility of a gross

22

disproportionality, or the significance of gross

23

disproportionality between the political and the common

24

law character.

disproportionality?

In McMullen, did the board adopt a gross

MS. WETTSTEIN:

That's right.

They used that term?
It applied the gross, and it

also applied the atrociousness test.

So it applied both

7

of those tests and found that McMullen's actions, contrary

8

to Mr. Aguirre's actions, were in fact grossly
disproportionate and were atrocious, and --

10

QUESTION:

Did they say that that was a

11

condition, that that condition always had to exist in

12

order for the crime to be nonpolitical?

13

MS. WETTSTEIN:

No, Your Honor, they didn't say

14

it was a condition, but it does -- those were the tests

15

that they applied, and that again mirrors --

Circuit is saying that, that -- they're saying several

MS. WETTSTEIN:

because the Ninth Circuit assumed that there were tests in

You said we don't have to --

MS. WETTSTEIN:

No, Your Honor.

In fact, the

may be appropriate to remand to the Attorney General to

determine that question in the first instance, whether, in

fact, the risk of persecution needs to be considered when

you're applying this exclusion ground, so this Court

12

certainly does not have to reach that question.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I'll ask for clarification

14

whether indeed it's true that the Attorney General has not

resolved that issue.

Right.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
QUESTION:

Is it true that the Government has no

position on the balancing test, the third ground of the

11

Ninth Circuit's decision?

12

MS. MILLETT:

Absolutely not.

The position was

13

taken in Rodriguez-Coto, it needed to be taken there

14

because he had committed crimes in Cuba and in the United

15

States; those had to be addressed and,

16

the Attorney General's position is clearly reflected in

our brief in this case.

18

Now, the reason it was not mentioned

specifically in the board's decision is -- I would like

20

this Court to keep in mind that the respondent didn't file

1

With all that, suppose it were

established crystal clear that if this person is sent back

to Guatemala he will be horribly tortured, the answer

would still be the same?

5

MS. MILLETT:

The answer under the withholding

But looking at the paragraph that you just read,

and the Ninth Circuit, it may be that everybody agreed on

what the standard was, and it's that McMullen standard,
