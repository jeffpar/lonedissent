ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The issue in this case is the meaning of the

12

word coal, as used by Congress in reserving the right to

13

mine and remove coal in the 1910 and 1909 Coal Lands Act.

14

The court of appeals held that coal also

15

includes methane gas that happens to reside within the

16

coal bed, and that in addition to the right to mine the

17

coal, that the United States and its assignees also have

18

the right to mine and to remove the gas from the coal bed,

19

the rationale here being that you can not only essentially

20

take out all of the coalbed methane, but that you can

21

leave all of the coal behind.

22

counterintuitive description of the rights of the United

23

States and its assignees is absolutely wrong, and that the

24

judgment of the court of appeals ought to be reversed.

25

QUESTION:

It seems to me that this

Mr. Phillips, you already brought up

to ask you to speak to, and I'll ask you now.

of mining and removing.

and 1910, referred to, I think it was, what, prospecting

mining and removing the coal?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

QUESTION:

9

You spoke

The acts involved here, both 1909

That's correct, Justice Souter.

Was the usage at the time such that

it would make sense to speak of mining gas?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Not typically, although to be

10

honest with you, I wish I could make more of that

11

argument, Justice Souter, but if you look at the 1914 act

12

and its description of dealing with gas and oil,

13

phosphate, and the other minerals that it identifies

14

there, it uses essentially the same language.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

They used it generically.
So while I'd like to take

17

advantage of that particular language, I can't.

On the

18

other hand, it is still absolutely clear, I think, to go

19

back to the word coal, which is the pivotal term in this

20

particular statute, that you would hardly find a word that

21

is more commonly understood by the average individual in

22

1909 and 1910.

23

of this Nation's energy, and Congress, according to this

24

Court, at that time acted in a practical way and defined

25

the rights in practical terms that could be understood by

QUESTION:

2

Well, I mean, as I understand it, you

3

assert the right not only to take out the methane that --

4

the gas that happens to be in the coal when you mine the

5

coal, you assert the right to by whatever means drill a

6

hole and take out just the gas and leave the coal, right?
MR. PHILLIPS:

7

Well, I don't have the right to

8

take the coal, you're right, Justice Scalia.

9

is the right to the natural gas.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

All I have

Right.
It's my opponents who claim that

12

they have the right to -- that based on their right to the

13

coal, that they in fact can take out all the gas, leave

14

all the coal behind, and that, what is to me --

15

QUESTION:

What if -- what if --

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- Justice Scalia, is the

17

counterintuitive nature of the argument of the holding

18

below.
QUESTION:

-- there's some water that adheres to

the coal as well, I mean, a certain -- that is, in its

21

composition.

Would they be able to extract the water from the

1

chemically and as a matter of law.

2

well would understand, out in Colorado and in the West,

3

the rights to water are essentially held by the States and

4

the relationship between the States and private parties

5

are fundamentally different than the relationships

6

involved in a litigation like this one.

7

First of all, as you

But second of all, the coal -- excuse me, the

8

water that is in the coal is chemically bonded, or at

9

least some of it is chemically bonded to the coal, and it

10

is not our position that chemically bonded elements which

11

are in fact constituents of the coal are subject to

12

removal by those who have rights to other minerals that

13

may exist.

14

Our basic point here is that coalbed methane is

15

essentially a physically separate item that just happens

16

to reside within the coal bed.

17

QUESTION:

Well, what if the coal miner digs

18

into the coal and in the process releases this gas that

19

you say the petitioner owns?

20

the petitioner for the release of that gas?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Is the coal miner liable to

Well, it's going to depend on

22

the, essentially the State tort law, or the tort law that

23

would be applied to it.

25

rights, when they conflict with respect to particular

1

minerals, has a certain amount of right to get at their

2

property, and so the coal miner is allowed to --

3

QUESTION:

But as a practical matter, what would

4

happen to the coal miners who are trying to take out the

5

coal and at the same time releasing gas, if your position

6

is correct?

7
8

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think if they release the

gas and we don't assert any rights to the gas, we have no
basis to come in after --

10
11
12

QUESTION:
rights to the gas.

Well, let's say you do assert the
That's why you're here.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Then the solution to that

13

problem is to say to the coal miner, if you go ahead and

14

waste the gas under those circumstances, you do so on

15

notice of the claim, of our claim to that gas, and that

16

claim is one that ought to be respected by the courts --

17

QUESTION:

It's the --

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- and there is an accommodation

1

then that would be worked out between the coal rights

20

owner and the gas rights owner.

21

QUESTION:

The same accommodation problem arises

22

when oil and gas rights are owned by different parties at

23

different levels.

MR. PHILLIPS:
same, Justice Kennedy.

Exactly.

It is precisely the

1

different from the surface owner's rights and the coal

2

rights owners.

3

QUESTION:

Well, except that the gas doesn't

4

adhere to the oil the way it adheres to the coal.

5

you can say he's taken away your methane if he just fills

6

up a truck with coal and carts it off.

7

there are pockets of gas, as I understand it.

8

gas that adheres to the coal when he carts it away, and

9

indeed, some of the energy that is derived from burning

10

the coal is, in fact, derived from burning the methane.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean,

It isn't just that
There is

Well, the amount that's derived

12

from burning the methane is negligible as a scientific

13

matter, so that's not likely to be particularly important.

14

But second of all, I mean, the point of this, I think, is

15

to step back and say, what did Congress understand by all

16

of this when it made the reservation of coal?

17

Did Congress mean to say that we were going to

18

engage in an extended chemical or chemistry analysis of

19

this problem, or did Congress say, look, we know coal when

20

we see coal, and we know --

21

QUESTION:

Right, but --

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- coalbed methane when we know

23

that because it comes out and gets vented as a part of the

24

process of mining the coal.

25

QUESTION:

But that's the point I was making, at

1

least as to the methane that is not in a pocket.

2

pocket, I think you make a strong point that Congress

3

couldn't have intended that, but I think on the other

4

hand, as to that methane that is not in a separate pocket

5

but has really been -- I guess it isn't absorbed, but it

6

just adheres to the coal, I can't imagine that Congress

7

thought that when somebody loaded up a truck with coal

8

from his coal mine he was stealing your methane.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

In a

I don't doubt that they don't --

10

that there's no notion that we have a right to make an

11

argument along those lines.

12

and out, I don't see that we have any basis for going in

13

there, but the more fundamental question is, do they have

14

the right, when we own the gas inside the coal, whether it

15

is adsorbed or held in a free state, to go in, drill into

16

that coal and release all of the gas that otherwise

17

belongs to us, and our argument there is clearly no, you

18

can't.

19

Once the coal's been removed

That cannot be the rule.
QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, you said what -- when

20

Congress used the word coal, it had a meaning, and in

21

1910, if I were to put the question, who has dominion over

22

this gas -- as I understand it, it was bad gas in 1910,

23

and wouldn't the answer be, of course the coal miner is

24

responsible, has the care of, the guard of that gas, has

25

dominion over it, and if there's an explosion, the coal

owner is going to be responsible?

2

understanding that Congress had in 1910 --

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

4

QUESTION:

5
6

Wasn't that the

Well --

-- when this gas was not considered

any kind of an asset?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

There's -- I mean, there's

7

no evidence that Congress had an understanding that the

8

coal miner had, quote, dominion over the gas.

9

Congress knew in 1909 and '10, just as we do today, is

10

that there is such a thing as coal, and there's such a

11

thing as gas, and that Congress had the authority to

12

reserve either coal or gas or all of the minerals or none

13

of the minerals.

14
15

QUESTION:

There had to be some control over

this when it was a hazardous waste.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

What

Yes.

I mean --

Didn't someone in 1910 have

responsibility for handling that bad gas?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

The coal miners had to vent

20

the gas in order to allow the mining to go forward, that's

21

absolutely correct.

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

So they had the control over the gas

to see that it didn't cause injury.
MR. PHILLIPS:
Ginsburg, as control.

Well, you describe it, Justice
I describe it as, they were

rights over the coal.

where your right is to waste or otherwise injure somebody

coal, and go through the surface, in injuring the surface

11

I don't get title to the surface.

12

certain extent, but I don't get title to it.

13

point here is that Congress was dealing with a practical

14

subject in a practical way, trying to decide who should

15

get title to what element, to what minerals, and in 1909

16

and 1910, Congress took a baby step in depriving the

17

patent holders of their rights to a full-fee property, and

18

it said, we're going to take back the coal, and the reason

19

it did that was for a very specific problem.

QUESTION:

Now, later --

QUESTION:

Why doesn't it make sense to say that

argument.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

3

QUESTION:

4

No, Justice Scalia.

Your argument is that all of it,

whether it's --

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Exactly.

And the reason for

6

that, Justice Scalia, is that the method of extraction is

7

identical.

8

pressure, all of the gas moves, not just the gas that's in

9

a free form, but the gas that's adsorbed.

The point of this is, once I decrease the

The adsorption

10

is van der Waals forces, which I'm 100 percent sure

11

Congress never thought about in 1909, and --

12

QUESTION:

Well, I certainly didn't, I know.

13

MR. PHILLIPS: -- they'd break immediately upon

14

the reduction of pressure, and then the gas flows out.

15

That's why it's meaningless to distinguish one from the

16

other, because the extraction process is identical.

17

QUESTION:

May I just follow up on one of

18

Justice Scalia's questions, because I think I under --

19

it's a tough case.

20

about that.

21

QUESTION:

It's a tough case, there's no doubt

But supposing your extraction method

22

Am I right on that, factually?

MR. PHILLIPS:

4

Those large lumps of coal still have some

days.

QUESTION:

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

10

Who owns that methane?
We own that methane, but there's

nothing we can do about it.
QUESTION:

8

9

There will be, at least for a few

You still own that, even though

it's -MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure.

We own that methane, but

11

there's nothing we can do about that methane, because

because methane's natural gas.

And if a large piece of coal happened

piece of gold, an old shoe, or whatever it was, you would

20

own that old shoe, too?

(Laughter.)

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

As I understand it, I mean, the

23

reservation of rights is quite clear here.

QUESTION:

1

2

But not whatever might be within a

piece of coal.

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's correct, and if you go

4

back to the Smoot case, for instance, the Illinois court

5

of appeals decision that was rendered at or around the

6

early part of the 20th Century, talking about pyrite and

7

coal, and they were both removed, and one was a waste

8

product for the coal, and the Illinois court of appeals,

9

relying on general common law principles, said the owner

10

of the pyrite is different from the owner of the coal.

11

They are separate estates.
QUESTION:

12

Now --

Was there ever a commercial practice

13

of taking the coal, in the ordinary sense that we think of

14

a lump of black stuff, and refining it or processing it to

15

get gas?

There was a very early stage

There's some literature on that.
QUESTION:

If that had happened, would you have

said that they were mining coal or extracting gas?
MR. PHILLIPS:

They were mining coal, because

that, you have to take the coal, you have to work on it.
QUESTION:

Just like if you take timber and make

it paper, you're taking timber, not paper.
MR. PHILLIPS:

relies upon as part of its argument that this is a

constituent of coal.

3

use heat in order to get gas out of it.

4

is that we're allowed to use the same simple extraction

5

process that we would use if we were trying to get the gas

underneath the coal.

We're not saying we're allowed to

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9
10

All we're saying

Do you know -We can go right through the same

coal seam.
QUESTION:

Do you know whether or not in the

11

West Virginia and Pennsylvania area -- maybe you don't

12

know the answer to this question -- did the common lease

13

say that the lessee is entitled to extract coal, reserving

14

to the owner all other minerals?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16
17

I don't know the answer to that,

Justice Kennedy.
QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, after the legislation

18

you're talking about, 1909, 1910, subsequently Congress

19

enacted other laws, I believe, in subsequent land grant

20

legislation to reserve gas estates, did it?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I

22

think that reveals plainly Congress' ability to

23

distinguish gas from --

QUESTION:

Well, what is the best indication

that in those subsequent legislation, in the subsequent

1

legislation reserving gas to the Government, that it

2

intended the gas to include the coalbed methane?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if you look at the

4

regulatory definition of gas as it's implemented in the

5

coal -- I mean, excuse me, the Mineral Leasing Act of

6

1920 -- and in the Mineral Leasing Act, remember, Congress

7

decides how it's going to obtain moneys for the rights

8

that it reserved under both the 1909 and 1910 acts, and

absolutely is dead on with coalbed methane, because all

it's talking about is a substance that in ordinary

So Congress did later have

MR. PHILLIPS:

Not only can it be persuasively

shown to do that, but the Solicitor of the Interior in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. DAVIDSON

MR. DAVIDSON:

4

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
As you know, I'm here on behalf of the amici

6

7

States.

There are five amici States which represent one-

8

tenth of the Union.

9

and ourselves.

We're here on behalf of our citizens

We're here as friends of the Court because

10

we believe the decision was inherently wrong, but we're

11

also here in our own interests.

12

We, as amici States, we as States, are owners of

13

lands that are subject to these very same acts.

14

admission to Statehood for the creation of the States and

15

for the benefits of our public schools we were granted

16

lands specifically for the purpose of funding education,

17

and we were constitutionally in our enabling acts required

18

to dedicate the proceeds from those lands to the purpose

19

of our State educational systems.

20

Upon our

In 1906, with the presidential withdrawal of the

21

coal lands, we were not allowed to select in lieu lands.

22

Now, in lieu lands -- first of all, upon admission to the

23

States, the States were granted specific sections of land

24

within each township, but oftentimes those lands had

25

already been homesteaded or withdrawn, so we were

1

entitled, then, to take in lieu lands instead of those

2

lands, but with the 1906 reservation, that also applied to

3

in lieu lands.

4

So the States were in the position of not being

5

able to select in lieu lands until a 1912 act came along,

6

which is referenced in our brief, that specifically

7

incorporated the provisions of the 1909 and 1910 acts, so

8

that's how the States are here.

property owners as well as on behalf of our citizens.

10

In these acts, the States received title to

believe, these lands were granted to the States under a

2

solemn agreement for the support of our public schools.

3

It was an inducement for the States to come into the

Union, and in inducing the States to come into the Union,

they granted the lands for the purpose of our public

schools.
QUESTION:

7

Do you think the States would have

reacted differently whether they knew how this case would

be decided?
MR. DAVIDSON:

10

Your Honor, I don't believe I can

accurately answer that, but I do believe that the States

12

took into account that they were getting everything in

13

under these acts but coal, and making -QUESTION:

14
15

Everything except the coal, but did

they know exactly what the coal was?
MR. DAVIDSON:

16

The States knew what the coal was

17

at the time, Your Honor.

I submit that everyone knew what

18

coal was at the time, and the acts that had preceded the

19

1906 reservation had been acts under which, if there was a

20

coal seam that actually appeared on the surface, or if

21

there was active mining, then those particular lands would

22

be reserved, because then the States or the private

23

parties would know that there was coal, because it was

24

physically there, physically present, something that was

25

tangible.

1

No, but isn't it at least conceivable

2

they might have thought, well, we get everything except

3

whatever's in the coal seam?
MR. DAVIDSON:

4

Your Honor, that was not the

understanding I believe of the States at the time.

not the understanding of the parties.

It hasn't been the subsequent

schemes or under the practice of any of the parties.
As was alluded to earlier, the coalbed methane

12

is obtained by normal drilling techniques, not by coal

13

removal techniques that were known to the parties at the

14

time.

15

16

coal, and you took a chunk of coal, or several chunks of

17

coal, and you loaded them into a wagon or subsequently a

truck, and you hauled them away.

Now, in response to Justice Scalia's question

regarding ownership, the gas, the natural gas, the very

faint remnants of natural gas that would remain in that

23

the owner of the gas estate, but the mining practices have

always followed the rules of reasonable development,

reasonable diligence, and in following the rules of

1

reasonable development and reasonable diligence at this

2

point in time, even now in 1999, it's not reasonable to

3

extract the methane gas from those chunks of coal that are

4

removed from a coal mine.

5

But while they're in the ground, and you can use

6

normal gas-drilling techniques to produce those, produce

7

the gas, then that is reasonable in some circumstances.

8

There are still many coal beds throughout the country to

9

which no coalbed methane is ever going to be produced,

10

probably, at least under present technology.
QUESTION:

11

But I take it -- I want to make sure

12

I understand one thing.

13

is to be distinguished from the coal is not only the gas

14

that has formed or collected in a pocket in the ground,

15

but the gas that can be extracted from the coal while the

16

coal still is in the ground, is that correct?

17

MR. DAVIDSON:

18

QUESTION:

You're claiming that the gas that

Your Honor --

You're talking about both kinds of --

19

you're talking about gas in both those aspects, is that

20

correct?

21

MR. DAVIDSON:

In the simplest of terms, Your

22

Honor, what I'm talking about is what can be removed with

23

drilling techniques, and in the instance of coal, while

24

there may be some pockets, typically what forms is cleats,

25

where you've got a layer of coal and another somewhat

1

layer of coal, and then you've got interspersed, there's

2

little tiny particles that respondents have referred to,

3

and when the water is extracted, these cleats allow the

4

gas that's adsorbed in there to come up through, because

5

the pressure is released, come up through the hole, the

6

drilling hole and then be escaped either into the

7

atmosphere --

8

QUESTION:

And you say that's yours.

9

MR. DAVIDSON:

QUESTION:

11

MR. DAVIDSON:

12

That would belong to --

Yes, okay.
-- whoever is the owner of the

remainder of the estate.

QUESTION:

You say the gas even in the lump of

14

coal that's on the cart is technically yours, although

15

there's nothing you can do about it, but you say that's

16

yours, too.

17

MR. DAVIDSON:

QUESTION:

19

But the doctrine of reasonable

accommodation takes account of that, presumably --

MR. DAVIDSON:

QUESTION:

23

That's correct, Your Honor.

Your Honor, that's --

-- and protects the miner of the

regulators, have had to deal with ever since mineral

2

activity has -- had ever commenced.

3

When oil drilling was first started, the natural

4

gas that was associated with oil drilling, and the first

5

oil well in Wyoming, anyway, I believe was prior to

6

Statehood, 1884, but the natural gas that comes up with

7

the oil well was flared initially, because it wasn't

8

valuable for anything.

9

But as was pointed out in an earlier question,

10

where the oil and gas estates are separate, that can't be

11

done anymore, and in fact the oil and gas, the State oil

12

and gas regulators ensure that that kind of flaring

13

doesn't happen, because the States have an interest.

14

Even where it's not their own property, as such,

15

the States have an interest because of severance taxes and

16

other interests that the States have in taxing those

17

products that there be conservation, that the mineral

18

resources, whatever they may be, be conserved, and so

19

therefore the oil and gas commissions don't allow flaring,

20

and don't allow wasting of natural gas products.

21

Your Honor --

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Davidson, am I right in thinking,

in relation to your opening remarks, that the States, when

24

they came into the Union, as this was an inducement, could

MR. DAVIDSON:

Your Honor, with specific respect

to coalbed methane gas, I believe that answer, that that

is correct, that they could not have specifically been

valuable resource.

9

and get it out.

10
11

There was no value.

There was no

It just was not a valuable commodity at

that time.
But just as natural gas that's associated with

12

oil production has now become a valuable commodity, so has

13

the natural gas associated with coal production, and so

14

the States, as owner of everything but what was

15

specifically reserved -- and keep in mind, Wyoming v.

16

United States establishes a standard that only what is

17

specifically reserved for the Federal Government can apply

18

to the States, and the legislation is to be construed

19

liberally for the benefit of the State.

20

Contrary to the presumption that the respondents

21

would like to raise with respect to States in particular,

22

who took under the very same acts as the private parties,

with respects to States in particular, grants, land grants

And we believe, and have believed

they were not looking at the statutory language here.

Here, Congress reserved coal in its natural

condition, coal deposits, and made it clear that's what it

was reserving, and the common understanding in 1909 and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

2

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

3

MR. MINEAR:

4

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Chief -Mr. Minear, sometime during your

5

argument, Mr. Davidson suggested that the principle you

6

relied on that at the point of where a grant is ambiguous

7

it is resolved in favor of the Government does not apply

8

where the grant is to a State, and he cited the case of
Wyoming v. United States.

10

Sometime during your argument,

could you address that?

11

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, Your Honor, I will do that.

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

13

Congress did not distinguish between coal and

14

CBM in 1 0 , because a reservation of coal at that time

15

had to include CBM.

16

coal in its natural state always contains CBM as an

17

inherent product of the coalification process.

realities, to describe what nature had deposited and what

1

Well, it certainly wasn't the

2

position of the Government's lawyers back when all of a

3

sudden it was discovered that the coalbed methane gas was

4

valuable and its development should be encouraged.

5

MR. MINEAR:

Justice O'Connor, you're referring

6

to the 1981 Solicitor's opinion, in which the Government

7

took the position that the coalbed gas was not a part of

8

the coal.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

Which was withdrawn, as I recall,

after this litigation began.
MR. MINEAR:

That is correct, and the reason why

12

it was withdrawn is because it proved that the reasoning

13

in that opinion was deficient.

14

QUESTION:

It didn't consider --

Well, I thought maybe it had

15

something to do with the fact that all of a sudden it was

valuable and the Federal Government thought it would like

17

to have that value.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. MINEAR:

Justice O'Connor, that can't be the

20

case, because it was known to be of value -- valuable in

21

1981, when that opinion was issued.

11

Well, Congress, after the 1909-1910

Government.

QUESTION:

Now, the Montana court -QUESTION:

Did those arise because the owners

11

attempted to dispose of the estate separately after they'd

12

made a previous conveyance of the coal right, or --

13

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

Those are both cases in which

14

the coal was conveyed away, and the question was whether

15

the surface owner continued to own the gas in the coal

seam, and in both of those cases -- and I think the

17

Pennsylvania case is particularly instructive, the Hoge

18

case -- the court indicated that, well, whatever coal

20

that is in the coal seam, remains part of the ownership of

which ranged from about 1 inch thick down to about the

14

thickness of paper, but it was clearly discernible, and

15

the court also indicated that a different rule would apply

16

if the iron pyrite was, in fact, intermixed within the

17

coal, which often happens, I should add.

QUESTION:

Is that because of the notion of

accommodation principles?
MR. MINEAR:

The court actually referred to the

21

principle of appurtenances, which is the notion that if

22

you're removing one material with another material, the

23

two necessarily go together, and it wasn't the idea of

24

simply accommodation, which is what we sometimes encounter

25

in other areas, but actually that it was a part of the

coal if it was truly intermingled.
Now, the court's reasoning is, I have to say

2

3

here it jumps from one point to another and it requires

4

careful reading, but I think you'll find that that's what

5

that opinion actually stands for.
The other State court decision that is contrary

6

7

to our position is the Montana supreme court decision from

8

just a few years ago.

9

and it distinguished the Pennsylvania case on the basis

It dealt with a 1984 coal lease,

10

that that dealt with a 1920 coal deed, and said that,

11

well, CBM was not recognized in valuable in 1920, so the

12

surface owner would not have necessarily wanted to hold

13

onto it.

14

and 1910 acts, so we think that actually State law is

15

consistent with the position that we've -- that we are

16

asserting here, and that's one of the things that has led

17

the Solicitor to change his view on this matter.

18

20

That same reasoning would distinguish the 1909

QUESTION:
the dates of them?

Are all the State cases -- what are
Are they all after 1953?

MR. MINEAR:

Yes.

Well, the Smoot case is 1907,

21

and that stands for the notion that coal is -- exists in a

22

stratum, and deals with the pyrite being in a separate

23

seam within the stratum.

24

with CBM are the Alabama case -- I believe it's called the

West case, which was decided in the early nineties --

QUESTION:

These are on page 36 of your brief,

footnote 26?
MR. MINEAR:

I believe that's right, yes.

Yes,

4

those three cases, the Montana case, which is called the

5

Carbon County case, and then the Hoge case, which is the

6

Pennsylvania case.

7

Now, I would like to touch upon the point the

8

Chief Justice raised with regard to the question of the

9

canon of construction that's applicable here.

We think

10

that the better view is that CBM is a part of the coal,

11

but even if the matter is debatable, we think that you

12

should apply the established rule that ambiguous grants

13

are interpreted in favor of continued public ownership for

14

the reason that Congress has not consciously determined

15

whether or not to give the material at issue up, and it

16

should be allowed under the Constitution to exercise its

17

right to make that determination.

18

We think that rule applies equally to the States

19

and private persons, because the reasoning for the rule is

20

the same in each case, and that is that Congress is vested

21

with the authority to hand out public property, and it

22

should be given the opportunity to make that --

23

QUESTION:

You say then, Mr. Minear, that Mr.

24

Davidson is wrong in citing Wyoming v. United States for

25

the proposition that he cited it for?

MR. MINEAR:

1

There are a number of different

2

canons that come into play, and I think it's true that

3

you'll find that there are statements that grants, for

4

instance, for schools should be construed liberally, that

5

grants to homesteaders should be construed -QUESTION:

6

Well, why shouldn't they -- you know,

7

if you want to say a number of different statements, the

8

things that you're relying on are statements also.

9

should one statement be elevated over another?
MR. MINEAR:

10

Why

Because we think this is the

11

statement, this is the canon that preserves the

12

prerogatives of Congress, which were truly important here

13

for disposing of the public property, and the States'

14

interests are -- will be reflected in the congressional

15

decision.

16

property, then Congress can determine what to do with it,

17

and in that regard, we note that Congress has already

18

acted under the Enzi amendment to protect the justified

19

expectations of anyone who has drilled --

20

If this material remains a part of public

QUESTION:

No, but it's not the Congress now

21

that it was then.

The Congress then was giving away

22

public lands and was giving away public minerals.

23

no harm's done if, you know, we interpret the ambiguous

24

thing the wrong way, Congress will fix it, it's a

25

different Congress.

It's not the same Congress.

to me we ought to just take our best shot at resolving the

2

ambiguity.

3

no harm done.

I don't know any basis for saying, you know,
It's a 00-year-old Congress.

MR. MINEAR:

4

Well, I think that the current

5

Congress is better-equipped than this Court to deal with

6

some of the issues, the outstanding issues such as the

7

safety issues arising from CBM development in

8

conjunction -QUESTION:

9

But they won't make the same

10

decision.

I mean, to say that they would make the same

11

decision that a 1909 Congress would is simply false.
MR. MINEAR:

12

But they're a better-educated

13

Congress.

They're a Congress that knows more about this

14

resource that was not well-understood -QUESTION:

15

Well, you're just saying that if we

16

decide the case in your favor, maybe Congress will do

something equitable, but that certainly isn't the question

before us.

The question is what Congress

the better view is that they viewed CBM as part of the

Congress can deal, if that ownership is retained, with

these problems, and in fact it has dealt with them in

things such as the Enzi amendment, which has protected the

the individuals.

cannot make these decisions wisely through the democratic

There's no reason to think that Congress

QUESTION:

Can they get back the money that on

10

the assumption that was adopted in the 1981 opinion some

11

companies have invested in getting gas rights that now no

12

longer exist?

13

Can Congress fix that up?

MR. MINEAR:

In fact, they have, in the sense

14

that they have disclaimed ownership of that methane that

15

has been developed in the past, so in fact those interests

are protected.

This is an issue that is really of the type that

requires legislative fact-finding.

that is both complex and there are many different issues,

and it is one that Congress has never decided and never

democratic process, it's quite appropriate for Congress --

Well, if Congress never decided it,

then you're saying that the 1909 things didn't -- don't

seems to me that the questions that you asked about the

fugaceous nature of the gas in the coal demonstrates as

Justice Souter, with respect to the means of

extracting it, all you do is drill at anything that will
