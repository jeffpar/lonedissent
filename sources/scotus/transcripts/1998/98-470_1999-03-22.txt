ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. WRIGHT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents a single technical

11

jurisdictional procedural issue.

12

first impression here, it would not be here if you had

13

ruled on it before, but despite all those negatives, I

14

submit that the case raises important issues both about

15

the efficient functioning of the district courts and about

16

the proper relation between courts of the States and

17

courts of the United States.

18

It is a case clearly of

Although I view it as a case of first

19

impression, I believe that a line of cases from this Court

20

has established a rule of law, and that from that rule of

21

law we can find the answer to this particular issue, and

22

the rule of law that I believe your cases support is that

23

a Federal court may make a wide variety of decisions prior

24

to determining whether or not it has subject matter

25

jurisdiction of the case, but that it may not decide any

1

issue that relates to the merits of the case.
We believe that that is the line that was

2

3

clearly drawn in Steel Co. and a line that has been drawn

4

in many of the other cases.

5

Your cases say that the -- that a court can pass

6

on the issue of class certification without deciding

7

whether or not it has subject matter jurisdiction, that

8

was Amchem, of course, that a court can hold that a lower

9

court properly exercised its discretion in declining to

10

use pendent jurisdiction without deciding whether pendent

11

jurisdiction existed under the circumstances of the case;

12

that a court can order Younger abstention,

13

hasn't decided whether it has subject matter jurisdiction,

14

that was Ellis v. Dyson; that a court can rule on a tag

15

bar to habeas corpus without deciding whether there was a

16

prisoner in custody, whether there is a final -- an

17

independent adequate judgment reason that would bar review

18

by any Federal court.

19

though it

We believe that there is a line of cases that

20

provide the rule by which this case is to be measured.

21

Then,

22

exception to that rule of law where, as here, the issue

24

it had subject matter jurisdiction,

making an independent judgment on that?

2

there should not be an exception to the usual rule on

3

those grounds.
QUESTION:

4

I submit that

Mr. Wright, the majority in the court

5

of appeals in this case reversed the district court, did

6

it not?

7

MR. WRIGHT:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, sir.
And the dissenters said that they

would uphold -- that they would affirm the district court.

10

MR. WRIGHT:

11

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
So it would have come out differently

12

in the district court if the dissenters' views had

13

prevailed.

14
15

MR. WRIGHT:

That is correct, Justice -- Mr.

Chief Justice.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, you're not arguing that

17

the Constitution requires one approach or another, are

18

you?

19

MR. WRIGHT:

I -- Justice O'Connor, I'm not

20

arguing that at all.

21

courts ought to have discretion on these matters and

22

decide what is the most efficient and expeditious way to

23

dispose of the case so long only as they do not get into

24

the merits of the case without having first decided that

25

they have subject matter jurisdiction to determine the

My submission is that district

2

merits.
QUESTION:

When we write the opinion, should we

3

say that that discretion should be exercised in a way so

4

that personal jurisdiction is usually decided after

5

subject matter jurisdiction, all other things being equal?

6

MR. WRIGHT:

7

the opinion that way.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WRIGHT:

It seems to me you could well write

Well, should we?
If I were writing it I would not

10

write it that way.

11

grant of discretion to the district courts to decide which

12

issue they are going to resolve first.

13

on them any rigid ordering, but as long as the ordering is

14

simply a presumptive priority for subject matter

15

jurisdiction I think that could be perfectly --

16

I would write it simply as a general

QUESTION:

I would not impose

Well, is there not a value to

17

Federalism in deciding subject matter jurisdiction first

18

in an instance like this, so that in the event it does not

19

exist, the State can address its own long-arm statute?

20

MR. WRIGHT:

I wonder if I could answer that by

21

putting to you a hypothetical.

22

QUESTION:

23

So long as you answer the

hypothetical for me.

24

(Laughter.)

25

MR. WRIGHT:

I'm surely going to answer the

1

hypothetical.

2

hope so.

In fact, I think it's self-answering.

I

Let us suppose that in this case our only

3
4

argument for Federal jurisdiction was fraudulent joinder

5

and therefore diversity, an argument that Norge should not

6

have been a party and then there would have been complete

7

diversity, and that the basis of the argument for

8

fraudulent joinder is that even if there was personal

9

jurisdiction with regard to the claims of Marathon there

10

was not personal jurisdiction with regard to the claims of

11

Norge.

12

you were wrong, there is personal jurisdiction over

13

Norge's claim, therefore Norge is properly a party,

14

therefore there is no diversity, and remands the case to

15

the State court.

16

And let us suppose that the Federal court says no,

In my submission we could not then come in and

17

seek to relitigate the issue in State court of whether

18

there was personal jurisdiction of the claims of Norge

19

against us.

20

Federal court and, under Baldwin v. Iowa Traveling Men, we

21

would be barred from ever raising that again.

22

mean that the State court would never have had an

23

opportunity to pass on that issue of personal

24

jurisdiction.

25

That would have been an issue determined by a

That would

1

this.

It seems that you give no weight at all to subject

2

matter jurisdiction as having some sort of a priority over

3

personal jurisdiction, assuming both are of equivalent

4

difficulty.

5

allowing the State in an instance somewhat like this to

6

have the first opportunity to address its own long-arm

7

statute -- assuming there's subject matter jurisdiction,

8

personal jurisdiction -- in the district court or

And isn't there a Federal interest in

questions of equal difficulty?
MR. WRIGHT:

10
11

Of course, there's always a

Federalism.
QUESTION:

12

Because you indicate there is some

13

discretion, and I want to know what are the determinants

14

in guiding that discretion?
MR. WRIGHT:

15

Well, I think that an important

16

determinant in guiding the discretion would be the extent

17

to which this would require the Federal court to pass on

18

difficult issues of State law, the extent to which the

1

questions of personal jurisdiction are intertwined with

20

the question of subject matter jurisdiction, as, indeed,

21

we think they are here, that all those would be relevant

22

considerations in deciding which issue you would address

23

first.

24
25

QUESTION:

You go further, I take it, than the

dissenters in the court of appeals.

As I understand their

1

position, it was the presumptively you decide the subject

2

matter jurisdiction first, but it's not an iron-clad rule.

3

The majority said it's an iron-clad rule.

4

basically just leave the whole thing up to the district

5

court.
MR. WRIGHT:

6

You would say

As the lawyer for Ruhrgas, I would

7

say we are very happy with the rule announced by Judge

8

Higginbotham and the dissenters in the Fifth Circuit.

9

I were sitting in my office writing an article, I would

10

say that there ought to be a general discretion.
QUESTION:

11

And yet there are many authors who

12

have distinguished subject matter jurisdiction as being

13

the most basic from personal jurisdiction, which those

14

authors have ranked along with, say, venue, as a merely

15

dilatory defense, suggesting that there is a hierarchy

16

here, and that subject matter jurisdiction is the more

17

basic.

18

If

MR. WRIGHT:

Justice Ginsburg, I would say that

19

I would not agree with them, that I would agree on the

20

great importance of subject matter jurisdiction.

21

My friends do me the honor of quoting from one

22

of my books in which I in turn quoted ex-Justice Curtis,

23

the questions of jurisdiction are questions of power as

24

between the Central Government and the States.

25

I believe that deeply, but I do not think that

1

personal jurisdiction is some sort of second-class issue.

2

It is an issue that stems from the Constitution, from the

3

Due Process Clause, and I do not think that you can say

4

that Article III takes priority over the Fifth Amendment.

the word dilatory.

I was quoting your text when I used

I imagined that I recognized the

words.
(Laughter.)
QUESTION:

I take it the point of your

11

hypothetical was that sometimes in deciding the subject

12

matter case, whether removal was proper, a district judge

13

would decide a host of State law questions, personal

14

jurisdiction questions, all kinds of other questions.

15

MR. WRIGHT:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
All right.

So who's to say?

In

17

other words, if your interest is in protecting the State,

18

who's to say?

It depends on the case.

19

MR. WRIGHT:

20

I could give another example.

Is that the --

That is exactly my submission.
Suppose a suit in

21

State court asking $50,000 in damages for breach of

22

contract and $1 million in punitive damages.

23

The case goes to the Federal court, diversity

24

being present.

25

State law does not allow punitive damages in a breach of

1

contract action, therefore the amount in controversy is

not satisfied, therefore I am remanding.
I think that the plaintiff in that case would

not be allowed to claim in State court that it could get

punitive damages.

6

declaration as to what the law of that State was to be for

7

the future, but as between the parties to that litigation,

8

that it would have issue-preclusive effect.

9

Obviously, that would not be a binding

QUESTION:

Mr. Wright, as to the preclusive

10

effect, imagine that this case had been dismissed for want

11

of personal jurisdiction.

12

in State court, and they say, State court, the first thing

13

we want you to do is to give us a declaration that there

14

is personal jurisdiction, and the reason that you're not

15

bound by that Federal court is, they lacked subject matter

16

jurisdiction, and that is open to collateral attack, so

17

that your premise about the preclusive effect is wrong.

18

The Federal court would be accomplishing nothing, because

19

it wouldn't bind the State court.
MR. WRIGHT:

20

Plaintiffs begin all over again

Justice Ginsburg, I don't believe

21

that the party would be allowed in State court to

22

challenge the preclusive effect of the judgment by saying

23

that the Federal court lacked jurisdiction to issue that

24

judgment.

25

can't challenge in a second proceeding whether there was

But how about Trinese v. Sunshine

Didn't that say you could challenge basis of

MR. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

It did, yes.
That you could relitigate the issue

7

of jurisdiction if the first court had not had

8

jurisdiction.
MR. WRIGHT:

9
10

I'm sorry, Justice Rehnquist, I'm

not prepared on that case.
QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure that's right,

13

QUESTION:

The --

14

QUESTION:

But all of those cases, in any event,

11

12

either.

15

involved a court that reached the merits, which assumes

16

that it has jurisdiction.

17

Here you have a court which never even assumed

18

that it has jurisdiction.

Even if your ordinary rule is

19

that it can't be attacked collaterally where it has

20

proceeded with an affirmance of its jurisdiction, it's

21

proceeded to the merits.
Here you have a case that doesn't fall into that

22

23

pattern.

24

says, you know, I don't really know if we have

25

jurisdiction.

You have a case where even the court issuing it

it decided the case on a different

1

later court

2

jurisdictional issue, and therefore never spoke to its own

3

subject matter jurisdiction.
MR. WRIGHT:

4

Well, I go back, Justice Scalia, to

5

I think it's 1803, McCormick v. Sullivan, that after a

6

judgment in a Federal court you cannot resist enforcement

7

on the grounds that in fact there was no diversity.

8

Diversity was -- existence of diversity was not challenged

9

in the first proceeding, but your Court held that a final

10

judgment is not to be attacked for lack of subject matter

11

jurisdiction.
QUESTION:

12

But here, it is attacked in the first

13

proceeding, and the court says, well, I can pick and

14

choose.

15

jurisdiction, just personal jurisdiction.

16

says, fine, it's never been litigated, so we will litigate

17

it and we will decide for the first time that there was no

subject matter jurisdiction and therefore nothing else

that was done in that action counts.

12

to think that it doesn't make much difference.

13

MR. WRIGHT:

You seem

Well, I'd, as I suggested a moment

14

ago, be perfectly content with saying that mostly you

15

consider it first, but look at a case such as

MR. WRIGHT:

QUESTION:

Why is that?

Why is-Why should we usually consider

subject matter jurisdiction first?
MR. WRIGHT:

It is a threshold issue, but

threshold issues not always have to be considered first.

That is what specifically was said in Lambrix v.

finished answering him?

2

MR. WRIGHT:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
What is the source, which I've often

4

wondered, of rules of law that say you always have to

5

decide some question of a certain kind first, for example,

6

jurisdiction before merits?
I mean, I've never seen anything in the

7
8

Constitution that says that.

9

about it.

10
11

I don't think Madison wrote

I haven't seen a statute that says it.

Is it

from the brooding omnipresence in the sky?
(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. WRIGHT:

I mean, where does it come from?
I think it comes, Justice Breyer,

14

from Article III, that the judicial power of the United

15

States extends only to certain kinds of cases, and that

16

therefore you have to find out whether this is a case that

17

is within your jurisdiction, but you have to do that

18

before you decide the merits.

19

You don't have to do that before you decide

20

whether to refuse class certification, and you don't have

21

to have subject matter jurisdiction from the beginning.

22

This is Caterpillar v. Lewis, in which not only

23

was there no subject matter jurisdiction at the time the

24

case was commenced, but when the nondiverse defendant Lane

25

was dismissed, it would have been too late to remove the

QUESTION:

Well, I wasn't sure.

There was some compelling practical

consideration in that case, though, was there not?

perfect diversity.

I agree completely.

I'd be a tenth

vote for that proposition, Justice Ginsburg.

very compelling case, but I think that the considerations

17

of efficiency and economy on which you expressly relied in

18

your opinion in that case are always considerations that

19

courts have to take into account.

20

compelling, as in your case, where there had been a

21

finished trial, but that doesn't mean that they do not

22

exist at an earlier stage in the litigation.

1

where there is a continuing lack of jurisdiction.
I submit that's not an accurate description of

2

3

this case.

4

The issue simply has not been decided.

5

There is no lack of jurisdiction in this case.

The en banc court expressly vacated so much of

6

the panel decision as it passed on subject matter

7

jurisdiction and remanded the case for the district court

8

to decide whether it had subject matter jurisdiction.

9

That decision has not yet been made, so it can't be looked

10

at as a case with continuing lack of subject matter

11

jurisdiction but as a case in which the issue of subject

12

matter jurisdiction has not yet been determined.

13

QUESTION:

But in your view it need never be

14

determined, because if the district court is right that

15

she could dismiss for personal jurisdiction and that binds

16

the State court, then subject matter jurisdiction is never

17

determined, and properly so.

matter jurisdiction never has to be decided because you

In the Lambrix case --

instances, like class certification, without even deciding
whether there's subject matter jurisdiction.
MR. HUTCHINSON:

Class certification is a

12

different issue, Justice O'Connor.

13

what the court said is that the certification issue was a

14

logical antecedent to a determination of subject matter

15

jurisdiction.

16

In the Amchem case,

Before justiciability could be analyzed in the

17

Amchem case, which was the issue that was being raised by

18

one segment of the class, the court had to determine

19

exactly what is this class so that it can then address

subject matter jurisdiction.

is a very good illustration of efficiency jurisdiction.

What's the court going to do then,

MR. HUTCHINSON:

What's

The court doesn't have the

power, Justice O'Connor, to decide that issue until it

determines that it has the capacity to decide the case,

11

and that comes from the fundamental difference between

13

QUESTION:

So you say it would have to go to

trial and determine these factual questions despite the

lack of personal jurisdiction.

MR. HUTCHINSON:

Justice O'Connor, you can -- I

17

think there are hypotheticals that you can come up with

that make it difficult for a court to determine subject

Professor Wright himself has indicated those are rare

MR. HUTCHINSON:

You have no exceptions, in

The exceptions, Justice

6

O'Connor, are those which have been established in the

cases, for example, the inherent power cases, which deal

8

with the court's authority to manage its docket and to

9

manage proceedings before it.

But when a court goes

beyond that, beyond that inherent power to maintain the

status quo, then it is exceeding its power under Article

III, and if --

Do you subscribe to that even when it

MR. HUTCHINSON:

Justice Scalia, I think it

applies -- from a constitutional standpoint it would apply

19

across the board.

QUESTION:

So in all cases, even if it's not a

removal case, where there is a personal jurisdiction issue

that the Federal court has to decide the subject matter

On the other hand, there is what Justice

2

O'Connor referred to as a rare case, which I looked at

this case and said, well, maybe this is it, in that this

party, Norge, that's alleged to be fraudulently joined as

5

a plaintiff, that's all bound up with the merits of this

case, so you may not be able to sort out whether there was

7

a sham party there inserted simply to block diversity

8

until you get to the merits and to see whether this Norge

9

has any real substance.

10

MR. HUTCHINSON:

That suggests, though, Justice

11

Ginsburg, that -- that a court has -- may re -- pre-try a

case in determining remand, and that would be against

congressional policy, that if all doubts are to be

that in this complicated picture till we get some kind of

That was the only evidence before the court.

questions were easy.

Fifth Circuit itself, the majority said, gee, we're a

subject matter jurisdiction, so we think it better go back

to the district court to decide?

10

If it was all that easy, then the majority of

the court of appeals surely would have said, yeah, the

it to the district court, and I don't know why.

jurisdiction had been insufficient service of process that

MR. HUTCHINSON:

10

Justice Ginsburg, in a removed

case, the courts are uniform in saying that doubts should

dictates of Congress in the removal statutes, and as this

MR. HUTCHINSON:

2

No, Justice Ginsburg, but there

3

are different types of cases in which this could be

resolved.

5

For example, the case cited, the American

6

National Red Cross case, where there is a question of the

7

interpretation of a 1900 Federal charter that was a purely

8

legal issue that had been resolved differently by

9

different circuits.

There it may be a difficult question,

10

but it's not a question of resolving factual doubts or

11

State law doubts, it's a question of looking at the

12

language of a charter and interpreting it.

13

In this case, there were questions of State law

14

intertwined with the factual situation, intertwined with

15

questions of the constitutional due process, so the court

16

had to address factual issues, and those factual issues

17

should be resolved in favor of remand.

QUESTION:

Well, I don't understand what you're

19

answering me, because I thought from your brief you say

that when the question is tough, accordingly where the

of the State in being able to take, in effect, first crack

Is there any sense among the

courts are?
MR. HUTCHINSON:

12

13

No, but the burden of proof is

different.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HUTCHINSON:

What is the difference?
The burden of proof is, under

16

the Kawasaki case in the Texas supreme court, the burden

17

of proof is on the defendant to disprove every ground of

18

personal jurisdiction, whereas the burden of proof applied

19

in Federal court is, the burden of proof is on the

plaintiff, so that's one difference.

process, we don't have to worry about it, we stop short of

2

that.

3

It's a question of due process, and yet you're

4

suggesting that the State court could have a burden of

5

proof that makes it easier for a plaintiff to assert

6

jurisdiction over a defendant than in the Federal court.

7

I would think that that, since it's a Federal

8

constitutional question, would have to come out the same

9

way with the same burdens in both courts, and if the Texas

10

courts have said something different, the defendant has to

11

negate jurisdiction, that's --

12

MR. HUTCHINSON:

Justice Ginsburg, what I think

13

the point here in this particular case is that the issues

14

of due process are intertwined with State law and with the

15

factual situation, because one of the issues in the due

16

process argument was, under the Texas long-arm statute

17

was, was there a tort in Texas?

18

I think the court got this wrong, but the issue

19

that the court addressed was, was there a completed

MR. WRIGHT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

in our briefs.

We didn't think it important enough.

The Fifth Circuit in fact has held that the

13

That's

The Texas supreme court has held that if a

14

plaintiff does not allege that defendant has performed a

15

specific act in Texas, then the mere finding or allegation

16

that defendant is a nonresident is enough to carry his

burden of proof, so I really think the burden of proof

that is constitutionally raised.

If the position for which Marathon has

believe that you are not subject to personal jurisdiction

10

to the court of the State, you can simply refuse to go

11

there, do nothing, and collaterally attack the judgment.

12

If you go there as in Baldwin and litigate the

13

personal jurisdiction issue, you cannot then raise it in

14

an enforcement action, but if you simply ignore the first

15

action, you can then challenge any judgment.

there is no in personam jurisdiction.
That, of course, I'm there positing, because my

2

3

friend Mr. Hutchinson says his rule applies across the

board to all cases, original and removed, and in an

5

original jurisdiction case I think that would simply be an

intolerable rule, and I don't think that it has much more

7

logic to commend it when it is in a case that is in the

8

Federal court by virtue of removal.
QUESTION:

9

Do you acknowledge, Mr. Wright, that

10

there's a stronger case for what Mr. Hutchinson proposes

11

in the removal situation, or does it really come down to

12

the same thing anyway, just a Federal court acting beyond

13

its -- allegedly acting beyond its subject matter

14

jurisdiction?
MR. WRIGHT:

15

Well -- excuse me.

Justice Scalia,

16

I think that the Federalism component becomes more

17

significant when it is a removed case, that here is an

18

issue that -- here is a case that if it had not been

19

wrongly taken to Federal court, as we presuppose a Federal

20

lack of subject matter jurisdiction, that the State court

21

would get to decide the matter, that there would be a

22

dignitary interest in the State court there.

23

yes, that is an element that has to be taken into the

24

scales.
