ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL R. Q. WOLFSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WOLFSON:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Under the Constitution's venue provisions, a

11
12

criminal trial shall be held in the State where the crime

13

shall have been committed.

14

that principle is to be applied in a case where the

15

offense has more than one actus reus element and where one

16

of those actus reus elements was carried out over several

17

States.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

The issue in this case is how

What's the English meaning of actus

reus?
MR. WOLFSON:

The English -- it can be the -- it

21

can be interpreted as the act of the crime, or the act of

22

the thing, and it does not have a universal meaning, but

23

generally speaking the courts have looked at -- have

24

isolated actus reus as the conduct that must be performed

25

by the defendant to make him punishable for a crime.

1

It is generally distinguishable from two other

2

aspects of the crime, the mens rea, or the mental state,

3

and other circumstances surrounding the crime.

4

generally the approach that is taken by the Model Penal

5

Code, which does not use the term, actus reus, but which

6

uses the term -- but which distinguishes among conduct,

7

mental state, and attendant circumstances, and that sort

8

of - - that provision of the various aspects of the crime

9

is also reflected in Justice Holmes' discussion of the

10

common law.
QUESTION:

11
12

This is

Is conduct an equally satisfactory

word, do you think, as actus reus?
MR. WOLFSON:

13

I think conduct is not an equally

14

satisfactory term, because actus reus refers specifically

15

to conduct undertaken by the defendant which society has

16

an interest in punishing.
QUESTION:

17
18

You could translate it as the

criminal, the criminal act.
MR. WOLFSON:

19

The criminal act, or the criminal

20

conduct.

I use conduct because one has to take into

21

account certain types of crimes that revolve on failure to

22

perform a duty in which I think one would have to

23

acknowledge that the criminal conduct was the failure to

24

show up at the appointed time and place, as opposed to

25

undertaking some overt act.

QUESTION:

1

You're right.

When you use a word

2

like conduct it sort of sucks in surrounding circumstances

3

more than -- you'd better stick with the Latin, I think.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. WOLFSON:

6

7

Well, I'm -- I'll do my best,

thank you.
But to return, our -- the rule that we propose

8

and that is reflected in this Court's decisions is that in

9

any State where any of the actus reus elements is carried

10

out, that is an appropriate place for the defendant to be

11

prosecuted.

12

In this case, that means that respondent was

13

properly prosecuted in New Jersey, because one of the

14

elements of the offense, defined by section 924(c), was

15

the kidnapping, which in this case was a continuing,

16

unitary, undivided crime that began in Texas, was

17

continued into New Jersey, which was for some period of

18

time the defendant's base of operations, and then was

19

continued into Maryland.

20

QUESTION:

Is that the criminal act that is

21

being punished by this statute?

22

MR. WOLFSON:

It is part of the criminal act

23

that is being punished by this statute.

24

where the court of appeals went wrong, I think, was to say

25

that the statute punishes the use of the firearm only, and

The statute --

1

they didn't look at the fact that --

2

QUESTION:

No, the use during --

3

MR. WOLFSON:

The use during, that's correct,

4

but that is -- that is our point, which is that it's not

5

just during, it is during and in relation to the

6

underlying crime of violence for which this defendant may

7

be prosecuted, and to obtain a conviction under section

8

924(c), the Government must prove that the defendant did

9

commit that underlying crime of violence, or was

10

punishable for it under some principle such as Pinkerton

11

liability, or aiding and abetting liability.

12

13
14

It is equally an element of the offense as the
use of -- as the use or carrying of the firearm.
In its application, this statute essentially is

15

no different from a statute that might define a crime of

16

aggravated kidnapping.

17

I mean, suppose, for example -- kidnapping is

18

defined in section 1201(a) of the United States Code, of

19

title 18, as whoever kidnaps and holds for ransom any

20

person shall be punishable by a term of years.

21

What 924(c)

-- it's as if there were an added

22

sentence to that section and says, and whoever, during and

23

in relation to that kidnapping, uses or carries a gun,

24

shall also be punished by an additional 5 years.

25

I think it would be odd in that situation if

1

someone were prosecuted for aggravated kidnapping to say

2

that the only place he could be prosecuted would be where

3

the aggravation took place, and not over the entirety

4

of - - and not anywhere where the entirety of the

5

kidnapping takes place.
Now, what Congress has done in 924(c) is, it has

6

7

essentially created sort of an off-the-shelf aggravation

8

element which can be applied to a variety of crimes of

9

violence or drug-trafficking crimes.
QUESTION:

10

What do you think that those who

11

revolted against King George would have thought if -- you

12

know, one of their objections was that he would transport

13

us across the seas to be tried for crimes.

14

What if King George had enacted a statute like

15

this that made it unlawful to use a firearm in connection

16

with a kidnapping offense, and the firearm was only used

17

in Boston, and the kidnapping -- I'm sorry, the -- yes,

18

the firearm was only used in Boston, and some of the

19

kidnapping during which the firearm was used occurred in

20

England.

21

22

Do you think they would have thought it was fair
to try the defendant --

23

MR. WOLFSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, if the --

-- in London for this firearm that he

possessed in Boston?

MR. WOLFSON:

1

If they assoc -- if the people who

2

used the firearm associated themselves with a kidnapping

3

that takes place in a variety of jurisdictions, the

4

Constitution's venue provisions do recognize that it is

5

proper to bring a defendant to trial in the place where he

6

has committed a criminal activity.

7

The Constitution does not say that the proper

8

venue for a crime shall be where the defendant, in the

9

State of which a defendant is a citizen.
Now -- or where the defendant has resides.

10

Now,

11

it might have taken that approach if the only principle

12

behind the Constitution's venue provisions was to allow

13

the defendant to be tried in his home district, which one

14

may assume is a more congenial district.
It balanced that with the other -- with another

15
16

objective, which is that it is appropriate to bring the

17

defendant to justice in the place where he has conducted

18

his criminal activity, and if a defendant undertakes,

19

voluntarily undertakes some purposeful activity that

20

causes harm in a community through the commission of a

21

criminal conduct, there's nothing in the venue provisions

22

of the Constitution that say he can't -- now -- he can't

23

be

24
25

QUESTION:

There's another statute that punishes

kidnapping, isn't there?

I mean, that's a separate

offense.

MR. WOLFSON:

QUESTION:

And this statute says,

MR. WOLFSON:

QUESTION:

9

if during

kidnapping you possess a firearm --

5

7

That is correct.

Use and carry.

-- you get an additional penalty,

right?
MR. WOLFSON:
kidnapping,

If during that -- if during your

the kidnapping which you carry out --

10

QUESTION:

Uh-huh.

11

MR. WOLFSON:

-- you use and possess a firearm,

12

uses or - - use or carry a firearm, you get an additional

13

penalty, but the penalty --

14
15

QUESTION:
the kidnapping,

Let's assume he gets a penalty for

all right.

16

MR. WOLFSON:

17

QUESTION:

Correct.

He could still be tried for using a

18

firearm during that kidnapping,

19

MR. WOLFSON:

20

QUESTION:

21

22
23

right?

Yes.

Because that's a separate offense.

There's an additional element involved.
MR. WOLFSON:

The separate offense is using --

is - - you must - -

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WOLFSON:

Using the firearm.
Right.

QUESTION:

1

That's the only thing he's being

2

punished additionally for, and you say even if he used

3

that firearm only in one State, he could be tried in

4

another State, where the kidnapping for which he's been

5

separately punishing -- punished for, happened also to

6

occur.

7

MR. WOLFSON:

Let me say on that point that it

8

is almost invariably the case that 924(c) charges are

9

brought in conjunction with the charges for the, what one

10

can call the underlying offense, and that is consistent

11

with Congress' expectation that the two charges would be

12

brought together, because it viewed 924(c) in the nature

13

of an enhanced punishment for that underlying offense that

14

was aggravated by the use or carrying of a firearm during

15

and in relation to it.

16

In other words, Congress believed that when

17

someone carries out this crime of violence or drug

18

trafficking crime, that is more deserving of punishment

19

because it was accompanied by use or carrying of a gun.

20

It is true that it is a separate offense.

21

element has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.

22

has to be trial by jury on that offense.

23

sentencing factor, but nonetheless, it is so closely

24

intertwined with the underlying offense that Congress

25

really saw it as increased punishment for the nature of

It's not a

It's -- for that particular offense.

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfson, you submitted the

3

revision of 924(c), and I notice that in this respect

4

there's no relevant change, and I wondered whether, in

5

light of Cabrales last term, whether the Government had

6

urged any clarification of this provision to avoid the

7

problem we're dealing with.

8

9

MR. WOLFSON:

I'm not aware of any discussion

about Cabrales in this revision of 924 (c) , which I

10

understand was more directed towards the Bailey issue

11

about where the gun is possessed, rather than the more

12

active type of uses as in use or carry.

13

It's not that uncommon for a -- for one of the

14

underlying crimes which 924(c) is added onto to be carried

15

out over a variety of States.

16

that inter -- one can imagine that that drug conspiracy, a

17

drug distribution conspiracy, for example, that was based

18

in Boston, and as part of that conspiracy someone might go

19

to another city, Miami or Houston, to obtain the drugs and

20

then bring them back to Boston.

21

I mean, one can imagine

He might - - one of those coconspirators might

22

use the gun while obtaining the drugs, and I think it

23

would be strange to say that the - - that if Congress

24

wanted the drug conspiracy and the 924(c) charge to be

25

tried together, I think it would be odd to say that the

1

only place it could be tried was in the city where the

2

drugs had been obtained, where the coconspirators had

3

entered for just a moment, when the base of operations of

4

the conspiracy was, say, in Boston.
It's that conspiracy, that distribution

5
6

conspiracy that the use of the gun made worse, and that's

7

I think how Congress really looked at the purpose of 9 - -

8

looked at the objective which -- of the 924(c) offense was

9

to punish that aggravation.
QUESTION:

10

Mr. Wolfson, help me out, because it

11

bears some relevance as to how I view this case.

12

I may have been wrong when I suggested earlier that you

13

could have tried the kidnapping in one place and then

14

later tried the gun offense.

15

wouldn't it?

16

the other does not.

17

I think

It would be double jeopardy,

Each offense has to contain an element that

MR. WOLFSON:

It would -- the -- if -- it is --

18

it's not -- I have to say, under this Court's decisions,

19

it's not clear, because it's true that they satisfy the

20

Blockburger test that the kid -- the 924(c) offense

21

contains all the elements of the kidnapping offense but

22

the kidnapping offense doesn't contain any that the

23

924(c)

--

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. WOLFSON:

Right.
But there are cases of this Court

1

which have said that in certain kinds of complex type

2

crimes like this, that the Blockburger test may not be

3

fully applicable.

4

I'm not aware of any decided case law in the

5

lower courts in this subject, but I believe Garrett v.

6

United States, which is a decision of this court that

7

talks about the continuing criminal enterprise statute,

8

suggests that, which is sort of similar to this case in

9

that there is an overall statute of carrying out a

10

continuing criminal enterprise, and one might say that

11

there are predicate acts of that that are the commission

12

of other offenses, and there's discussion in that decision

3

that says that the - -

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. WOLFSON:

6

One thing, Garrett is sort of -- actually, the

7

CCE type crimes, and crimes like RICO, have been treated

8

by the lower courts roughly similarly to the approach that

9

we've suggested in this case, which is that -- take RICO,

20

for example, where the defendant must manage the affairs

21

of an enterprise through the conduct of racketeering

22

activity.

23

Garrett is the name of it?
I believe that's the case, yes.

The approach taken by the lower courts is that

24

the defendant can be brought to trial wherever any of

25

those predicate acts of racketeering activity take place,

1

and though -- now,

though there may be situations where

2

those racketeering acts are carried out in more than one

3

State, and it's viewed as appropriate by the lower courts

4

that the defendant may be tried on the overall RICO

5

statute wherever any of those - - any of those racketeering

6

acts were committed.

7

Similarly,

there are other examples where --

8

other examples of offenses with multiple elements.

9

Another example is the Travel Act, which prohibits

10

crossing State lines with an intent to carry out certain

11

criminal activity and thereafter carrying it out or

12

attempting to do so, and the courts have said -- the lower

13

courts have said that the defendant may be prosecuted

14

either where he leaves or where he arrives,

15

then carries out the criminal act.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WOLFSON:

or where he

What about the Hobbs Act?
The Hobbs Act?

The Hobbs Act has

18

been applied to allow prosecution wherever the obstructing

act takes place.

20

QUESTION:

Suppose that a person hijacks a truck

21

in Maryland, and the contents of the truck were intended

22

for distribution everywhere from Puerto Rico to Alaska,

23

does that mean that he -- and it affects commerce in every

24

State of the United States and the territories thereof.

MR. WOLFSON:

The lower courts have said that a

was affected.

Now,

the Government would have to prove -So what's your -- your view is that

That's correct.

And there is no such thing as just a

looking at the actual nature of the offense laid great

2

emphasis on the fact that Congress had only used the

active verbs, uses and carries,

test,

makes venue turn on aspects of the statute that are really

immaterial, do not go to the -- they don't capture the

offense that Congress actually defined when it passed

And on that point, as Judge Alito pointed out in

MR. WOLFSON:

The point is, where everybody agrees what the

that, I don't think, it -- then the fact that Congress

18

captured it with one active verb and a prepositional

phrase, whereas it could have just as easily been restated

using two active verbs, should not affect the venue

outcome.

there's no requirement that the crime -- that the crime

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. MCDONALD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There is no escape from the logic that a

I

can look far and wide for a case.

I may find one that has

a clear jurisdictional element where they said that isn't

But aside from those cases, all the other cases

that you would pick out and say, no, no, here is a

MR. MCDONALD:

There is a case on point.

Which one?
Midstate Horticultural.

It's

15

this Court's opinion in 1939, and if I may, it was an

Elkins Act prosecution.
The Elkins Act prohibited the illegal payments

18

of rebates in interstate rail shipping.

broad venue provision under that statute, and it said, in

20

essence, that the crime could be charged anywhere where

the shipment took place in any State, similar to this

The facts

1

were, Your Honor, that the shipment had been made in 1932

2

and 1933 from California to New Jersey, but the payment

3

was only made in 1935 in the City of New York, and the

4

case was tried in Philadelphia, and this Court said no,

5

you can't do that.

6

They said that you must look at the acts of the

7

accused, where they were committed, and that is where

8

venue was laid.

9

QUESTION:

10

granting or the receiving of rebates.

elements of the crime?

MR. MCDONALD:

That's correct.

the other element of the crime was the interstate

shipment, and in that case, that part of the crime

18

occurred from California to New Jersey, and in every

19

State, and as this case found in Armour Packing, 30 years

20

before that in 1909, that had the payment been made

21

before, and the shipping continued, it could be tried in

22

any case through which the shipments proceeded.

3

Cabrales is very important for what it did not say in that

4

respect, as we look at this case.

5

MR. MCDONALD:

Well, Your Honor, I believe that

Cabrales supports our position.

7

in Cabrales the money laundering had to be the result of

8

an illegal crime.

9

had to be -- at least for the 957, that there had to be

That was part of the statute, that it

shown that the money was illegally obtained.

But it didn't have to be illegally

obtained by that particular defendant.
MR. MCDONALD:

13

That's correct, Your Honor, but

place or either the gun was used, and takes out the during

QUESTION:

No, but isn't the response to that

argument -- I mean, that's a fair argument, but isn't the

9

response to that argument a very practical one, that we're

10

getting at a problem of practical unfairness when we

11

devise venue rules and Congress passes them.

12

There isn't any practical unfairness here, for

13

the simple reason that in -- on the Government's theory in

14

a case like this, your client can be prosecuted in any one

15

of those other jurisdictions anyway, so that your client

16

is not being, as it were, transported across the seas in

17

the sort of Declaration of Independence sense, and isn't

18

that sort of argument for fairness the response to the

19

argument that you have just made?

20

MR. MCDONALD:

No, Your Honor.

Venue must be

21

determined on each count in the indictment separately, and

22

just merely because three or four counts in the indictment

23

confer venue in one place and one does not, there's no

24

practical application that permits the Court to try them

25

all in one place.

QUESTION:

Mr. McDonald, on your theory, what

would be the result under Judge Alito's suggested revision

of this statute, whoever commits any crime of violence or

court of the United States and during and in relation to

7

that crime uses or carries a firearm.
Would that be a different result under your

8

9

theory as to venue?
MR. MCDONALD:

10

I believe it is.

That is nothing

11

more than a sentencing enhancement at that point.

12

no longer a separate and distinct crime.

It is

Your Honor, it seems that everybody wants to

13
14

rewrite this statute.

15

the Government wants to rewrite it, and Congress has, in

fact, in the last month rewritten the statute, but that's

17

not the statute under which Mr. Moreno was tried and

18

convicted.

19

QUESTION:

The dissent wanted to rewrite it,

Well, but if under the dissent's

20

rewriting the venue would have been proper even under your

view, it is just strictly, then, a matter almost of

grammar to decide where venue can be.

MR. MCDONALD:

1

I don't believe so, Your Honor,

2

because no matter how you rewrite the statute, you -- I

don't believe that you can escape the clear language that

the gun must be used during and in relation to an

5

underlying crime of violence.

QUESTION:

Well, but that's -- that would be the

language in the rewritten version that I read you, and

8

during and in relation to that crime uses or carries a

9

firearm.
MR. MCDONALD:

10

Well, Your Honor, it would be our

11

position that that would -- trial would still have to be

12

held in the place where the gun was used during and in

13

relation to the underlying felony.

separate crimes.

MR. MCDONALD:

That is right, Your Honor.

3

Mr. Moreno was tried and convicted and punished

4

for kidnapping.

5

could have been tried in any number of districts in this

6

United States.

7

That was a continuing offense, and it

It is only when it comes together with the gun,

8

when he begins to use the weapon, as this Court said in

9

Bailey, when he torques up the stakes, when he makes it

10

more dangerous, when he commits another offense,

11

when 924(c) (1) begins, and not a moment before.

12

that is

We believe that the Cabrales decision warrants

13

rejection of the Government's position in this case.

14

Government's petition for certiorari in this case

15

recognizes the Cabrales decision would be dispositive of

16

this case, and they ask that the petition for writ of

17

certiorari be held pending the Court's disposition in U.S.

18

v. Cabrales, and disposed of as appropriate in light of

19

the resolution of that case.

20

The

Now, at that time the decision had not been

21

written, and I understand that, but Cabrales simply said,

22

it reaffirmed this Court's rulings for the last 90 years,

23

particularly that cite -- the standard cited in Anderson,

24

and it said, you must look to where the acts of the

25

accused, what acts were committed and violated the statute

in question.
QUESTION:

2

I'd like you to go back to what you

3

said just before.

It seems to me that this case was held

4

for Cabrales because if Cabrales had come out the other

5

way - -

6

QUESTION:

It would have been cert denied.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

8

MR. MCDONALD:

9

QUESTION:

10

If Cabrales had --

Suppose Cabrales had come out the

other way.

11

MR. MCDONALD:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MCDONALD:

In favor of the Government.

Right.
Then I imagine that they were

14

asking that it be remanded to the Third Circuit Court of

15

Appeals in - - for determination and resolution in

16

recognition of that holding, because we prevailed in the

17

Third Circuit.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. MCDONALD:

20

Yes.
And had the Court just simply

denied cert, we would still prevail.

21

Am I answering your question, Your Honor?

22

QUESTION:

Yes.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. McDonald, are you defending what

Yes.

24

is called the active verb theory?

I haven't heard you

25

really put much emphasis on that.

Is --

MR. MCDONALD:

2

QUESTION:

3

The active

Do you find that a useful mode of

analysis?
MR. MCDONALD:

4

I think the active verb test has

5

best been described by the courts of appeals and the

6

authorities as a very good first cut at understanding the

7

statute.

8

Most of the courts of appeals have not held that

9

it is an exclusive analysis of any criminal case, but they

10

have held that it is something that they utilize in their

11

examination of the statute as to where venue should lie.

12

If this Court adopted the active verb test, and

13

the active verbs in this case are use and carry, we would

14

prevail without much further discussion.
It dawned on us that there are a number of

15
16

circuits that have adopted this test, but this Court --

17

that test, but this Court has not.

18

that test, I believe that we would prevail under that

19

test.

20

If this Court adopts

It is a straightforward test.
QUESTION:

I've looked at the case you cited,

21

the United States v. Midstate Co., and there the Court was

22

very careful to say that the transport of the goods

23

through Pennsylvania was a lawful act, and that Congress

24

did not intend that subsequent conduct or events should

25

stamp criminality upon an act that was lawful, and so

there's no continuing event.

That's quite different from kidnapping, which
was unlawful at all times.

MR. MCDONALD:

QUESTION:

In that respect,

it is --

I think the case is just not so

helpful for your position.

QUESTION:

That wasn't the distinction the Court

15

made.

16

then it must be an offense in the State which is -- where

17

the case is being tried, and it found that that was just

18

not that -- not true.

19

The Court said,

if you have a continuous offense,

MR. MCDONALD:

Well, under the Elkins Act, most

20

of those offenses -- and as this Court has said time and

21

again in venue cases,

22

look closely at the facts of the case.

23

they are fact - sensitive and we must

That's not what -- I just got that to

look at it.

I just agree with Justice Kennedy.

7

as if the statute said it's an illegal offense to give or

receive a rebate, and what it seemed to say -- I just

looked at it quickly - - is that in Pennsylvania the

So it sounds as if the Court's saying,

statute.

under the Elkins Act the -- it could well be a

is there a case where I could

look at it and find the following, any case in any court.
What I'd look at is,

there'd be a statute, and

the statute would have several elements, and I'd leave out

of the picture any element that the defendant - - that does

All right, now are you thinking of a set of

elements?

See, what

21

they're saying is that, despite perhaps the appeal of your

argument,

that the courts have never -- never, never, never departed

from.

2

but the

3

three cases which have said that there are five elements

4

to this crime, and four of those elements involve the

5

defendant, and as to number 4, you can't put it there.

6

It's just peripheral.

-- a clear answer that would be, look, here are

It's too irrelevant, too far away.

MR. MCDONALD:

7

Well, there are no cases that I

know of that have held that, but what the cases have said

9

is that you must look at the acts of the accused, and they

10

are fact - specific, and I don't know of -- I'm trying to

11

think of cases where the defendant where it'd be as fact-

12

specific as this, where the gun and the kidnapping came

together only in one place and only at one time.
