ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United

there was some indication that different jurors can be

persuaded by different pieces of evidence so long as they

all agree on the bottom line.

indication that jurors don't have to view each piece of

evidence unanimously --

I -- I think there's some

Guilt or not guilt of the charged

offense.
MR. BARNETT:

12

Yes, but the offense is defined.

13

And with respect to the definition of the offense, there

14

are certain constituent facts which the jury, as the

15

finder of fact, is required to find beyond a reasonable

16

doubt.

17

those constituent facts are that the primary elements are

18

that the defendant be -- have committed a crime which is a

19

felony under the Federal narcotics statutes --

In the continuing criminal enterprise statute,

And if it's part of a continuing

21

series of violations, and it doesn't say how many or what.

you would seek to do it.

1

2

Well, Congress didn't seem to pin it

down.

3

MR. BARNETT:

4

QUESTION:

Congress --

Now, in RICO you've got a much more

5

precise scheme spelled out than here.

6

a continuing series of violations.

7

MR. BARNETT:

Congress just said

Well, you're correct, Your Honor.

8

In the RICO statute, it specifically states that there

9

have to be at least two and that they have to fall within

10

a certain time period with relationship to each other.

11

QUESTION:

Right.

12

MR. BARNETT:

On the other hand, just because

13

Congress called it a series of violations, in this case

14

instead of defining it as three or more violations or some

15

other specific definition, nevertheless, the word series

16

is a conclusion.

17

The word series means nothing without a context, without

18

an object of the preposition.

19

It's a conclusory statement of fact.

What is it a series of?

And they have defined that specifically in the

20

continuing criminal enterprise statute as violations of

21

the Federal narcotics laws.

22

specifically defined throughout the -- the statutory

23

framework, each and every one, and each and every one has

24

well defined elements which have been defined and

25

judicially interpreted over the years.

Those violations are very

to focus in on what it is that the series was comprised

Well, there was ample evidence here

of, if you will, a continuing series.

MR. BARNETT:

Well, a series is made up of the

constituent elements.

would have to find that they -- and it then occurred at

So, in order to find a series, you

support the findings necessary.

MR. BARNETT:

Your complaint is just

That's correct, Judge.

This is

not a sufficiency of the evidence case.

QUESTION:

Mr. Barnett --

17

QUESTION:

The statute requires in section 1

18

that you violate a provision of the chapter and commit a

19

felony.

20

MR. BARNETT:

21

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.

You're not alleging that there was a

22

defect in -- in the findings as to that part of the

23

statute, are you?

which is the continuing series.

You're just addressing subclause 2,

there's a defect in the statute at all.
QUESTION:

3

Pardon me.

A defect in the proof

under the statute.
MR. BARNETT:

I'm not suggesting there was a

defect in the proof here.

This is not a case about the

proof.

each of the elements had been --

It's a question as to whether or not the jury was

QUESTION:

My own questions are imprecise.

Are

10

you saying that there is an insufficient finding on the

11

part of the jury with reference to paragraph 1 of the

12

statute as well as to paragraph 2?
MR. BARNETT:

13

Insofar as it is implicitly

14

included in the series, yes, I am.

15

Government has taken the position that that issue has been

16

waived.

instruction that the jury find with respect to the series,

defined as at least three, that it find unanimously that

today that was legally wrong and violative of the

Constitution.

5

And that was -- at least I'm arguing here

QUESTION:

Well, what do you mean violative of

the Constitution?
MR. BARNETT:

6

The Due Process Clause requires

7

sufficient specificity so that a man understands what it

8

is he's charged with.
QUESTION:

Well, that's the indictment.

10

nothing wrong with the indictment here.

11

gives him notice of what he's charged with.
MR. BARNETT:

12

There's

The indictment

Yes, but during the course of the

13

trial, a man must be able to meet the charges that are

14

being made against a man.

15

scattershot fashion so that he's, in effect, asked to hit

16

a moving target in -- in cross-examining witnesses as to

17

specific events when they don't give testimony with

18

respect to specific events and it's a generic type of

1

testimony, then it puts him in an untenable position --

20

excuse me.

21

QUESTION:

When it is set forth in a

Supposing in this case, there had

22

been evidence of six other convictions -- criminal

23

enterprises that met that definition, and the judge had

24

charged the jury that you must find that the person

25

committed three of those offenses.

Now, do you think that

1

the law requires that the jurors agree on which three of

2

the six were committed?

3

MR. BARNETT:

Yes, I do, Judge, and the reason

4

for that is because if they do not agree -- if you cannot

5

get the jurors to agree unanimously as to any one of those

6

elements, you have to drop it out.

7

but you can only get unanimous agreement on two, for

8

instance, you haven't proved a series of six.

9

QUESTION:

So, if you have six,

What about if you have thousands?

10

Because wasn't that the Government's case?

11

abstract about agreeing on the particulars versus the

12

conclusion is one thing, but here the Government says

13

where we have a continuing series that involves thousands

14

of separate transactions and they didn't --

MR. BARNETT:

QUESTION:

To talk in the

But --

Was the prosecutor wrong in saying

17

that that was the series?

18

every $20 bag of heroin, each one of those sales was a

19

transaction in this series, and he said that the proof

20

supported literally thousands of -- and from the

21

thousands, the jury is supposed to pick out three or four?

22

That just seems to make no sense to me.

23

MR. BARNETT:

He said every $10 bag of crack,

Well, with respect to that series

24

of thousands that he's talking about, the testimony that

25

came in was from essentially three witnesses -9

QUESTION:

1

First, did the Government charge that

-- that that was the -- that's the continuing enterprise

3

that they were dealing with, one that involved thousands

4

of transactions?

5

accurate characterization of the series that the

6

Government charged?

7

Are you challenging that that was an

MR. BARNETT:

The way it was charged was as a -

8

- a conspiracy, and off the top of my head, I can't

9

remember if they said this involved thousands of

10

transactions.

11

inferential jump from the terms of the indictment and the

12

way the conspiracy was described to -- to conclude that,

13

yes, this was a case involving thousands of transactions.

14

But you can certainly make the -- the

QUESTION:

And the judge is supposed to tell the

15

jury, this case involves thousands of transactions, but

16

you have to pick out three and agree on those.

17

so, then -- then doesn't the judge have to list all the

18

thousands, every runner who testified?

19

remember their individual sales, but they were able to

20

say, yes, we sold on an average of so much a week, so much

21

a day.

MR. BARNETT:

MR. BARNETT:

QUESTION:

7

And they -They

Right?

That's true.

And they could have provided a lot of

evidence for -- for just those three or those five.
MR. BARNETT:

8

They also could have charged

9

predicate acts as substantive crimes, which they chose not

10

to do, which interestingly, the -- the RICO statute, which

11

has been referred to here -- routinely the Government

12

charges the predicate acts as substantive crimes.

13

convictions on those underlying substantive crimes become

14

the basis for finding the predicate in the RICO charge.

15

But in this statute, the Government has taken

And the

16

the position that because the word series of violations is

17

not as specific as in RICO, they don't even have to charge

18

any predicate offenses.

19

with that.

20

they do not, they should at least be required to point to

21

three offenses and say, you've got a series.

22

agree on the three offenses, and particularly one within

23

the statute of limitations, then you've got a series --

point to the five people?
MR. BARNETT:

2

The five-person requirement, as I

3

view the statute, is significantly different from the

4

underlying offenses.

5

continuing criminal enterprise statute is contained within

6

the fact that there are narcotics violations which have

7

occurred.

There is nothing else in the statute that's

8

criminal.

Hanging around with five other people or making

9

a lot of money is not criminal in and of itself.

10

- and in the structure of the statute, those are

11

subsidiary to the primary element that the violation be

12

part of a continuing series.

QUESTION:

The -- the basic criminality of the

Those -

They are --

But, I mean, in terms of your -- in

14

terms of knowledge of the defendant, in terms of your

knowledge as a defense attorney, when you see the

have to?

MR. BARNETT:

No.

Does it

No.
All right.

So, what do you do

if you want to know who they are?
MR. BARNETT:

You can file a motion for a bill

of particulars.
QUESTION:

Exactly.

And so, I -- I suppose that

24

that's just what you would do in respect to the offenses

25

as well, if you lose this case.

And you may win it, but

Well, the notice problem comes in

when you have thousands of transactions because you, in

in this case.

MR. BARNETT:

Indeed, there may have been

Well, in that event -- well, let

me back up a second.
QUESTION:

If -- if you're worried about that,

isn't your move to move for a bill of particulars?
MR. BARNETT:

But even a bill of particulars

18

wouldn't have done any good in this case if they gave us a

19

list of thousands of offenses and didn't say these are the

20

three that we're talking about.

In other words, you want -- you want

problem that you've got right now.

MR. BARNETT:

QUESTION:

That's correct.

So, what you're really saying is, I

have a right to -- to prepare, in effect, the -- the

6

narrowest and most -- and hence most manageable case

7

possible.

MR. BARNETT:

8

9

That's -- that's basically your argument.
Well, instead of -- well, I think

that it's fair to, instead of allowing the Government to

10

take a scattershot approach, when the ultimate argument

11

they are going to make to the jury is that you don't have

12

to look at anything in particular here, you just have to

13

take a look at the thousands of offenses and come to a

14

sense as opposed to a finding of fact that something has

15

occurred on such and such day three times in a row, but

16

instead have a sense that this is a bad man, that -- that

this activity is going on, but without pointing to the

Yes.

It's very --

All right.

MR. BARNETT:

Now, all right, fine.

So

Well, the -- there's a difference

18

between the characterization and the act, the legal

19

characterization of what the criminal act which has

20

occurred is, and whether the jury can distinguish between

21

two different legal characterizations of the same actus

which is set forth in Schad.

equivalent, does it make any difference whether it's

Therefore, the jury just has to unanimously agree, but

they are unanimously agreeing on a particular set of

facts, an actus reus, an act by the defendant which has a

What about Justice -- I think it was

Justice Scalia's hypothetical in his concurring opinion in

Schad that a person is charged with first degree murder

in the course of a felony?

There's also evidence that --

that the defendant intended and deliberated.

Does the -

first degree murder?

Take the -- the homicide example, the homicide

We don't know whether the jury agrees

MR. BARNETT:

11

That's correct, but with respect

And that may be a very strong argument for the Government

were, the principal act here could be proven in any of

But I thought the case that you had brought to

11

And -- and I think my point is you can't distinguish the

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

1

2

applied to the CCE statute, that principle means that the

3

jury must unanimously agree that the defendant engaged in

4

a continuing series of violations, but it need not agree

5

on the particular acts that make up such a series.
QUESTION:

6

7

And what -- what is the best

authority for that from this Court?
MR. GORNSTEIN:

8

9

As

The Schad case and the cases

that precede Schad establish the basic controlling

10

principle here, which is that the only thing that a jury

11

has to be unanimous about is the elements of the offense

12

and the jurors do not have to agree on the evidence that

13

support each element.

same result would follow.

Just as in Schad, if six jurors

2

had concluded there was no robbery at all and six jurors

3

had concluded there was no intent to kill at all, they

would still unanimously agree on the relevant mens rea.

QUESTION:

Congress can rationally -- rationally define the elements

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But when you read it in the

context of the whole statute, which is -- the following

equivalent of saying, there must be a series of violations

But to answer your hypothetical, Justice Scalia,

the question in that case would be is Congress or the

Justice Scalia, I'm not sure about

the background that you're speaking of, but I don't think

it's fair to compare this statute to a recidivism statute.

4

It is not.

5

It is a completely different kind of statute.
What it is -- what Congress was addressing here

6

was a new kind of crime, and that is the operation by drug

7

kingpins of large scale drug businesses from which they

8

derive substantial revenues.

It is not just somebody

committed one crime and then another.

It is a drug

business crime, and that's why it's called continuing

criminal enterprise.

rational for Congress to say -- to define the series

the particular acts.

And in -- in responding to that

And I would also distinguish this case from the

17

-- the case where you just have to prove a series because

there are other elements to this offense.

has to prove that there was a conspiracy.

It has to prove

were ever adopted, by -- you know, Congress comes in and

says, well, we're not talking about crimes here.

We're

talking about something called drug transactions.

And

10

they're not separately criminal, but if you combine them

11

in such a way, then they are criminal.

12

MR. GORNSTEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I just think

that illustrates that there's really not a -- a strong

14

principle behind it because even if you take Schad, I'm

15

not sure what the distinction is when you say, robbery is

a separate offense, but we'll move robbery in as part of

murder and say half of the jurors only half defined it and

then they found an element of the offense.

How do you --

QUESTION:

The answer -- no, please go ahead.

21

The answer may be, as I think Justice Scalia

22

suggested a second ago in -- in preface to his question,

Schad assumed that there was in -- it was possible in the

24

analysis to make a distinction between means and ends.

25

The end in Schad was -- was the killing.

by which that killing, in effect, was accomplished was -was -- was what we tend to call the mental element.

And

3

historically we have said the mental element can be proven

either as, you know, the factual element -- he deliberated

he was committing another offense when the killing

occurred, i.e., in Schad's case, robbery.

There was a

The trouble with applying Schad here is that I

10

don't think we're talking about the same kind of

But what you're doing is saying, there are

different means of proving the series, this three, that

MR. GORNSTEIN:

But Schad announced a principle

14

that was broader than just the means.

It was a

15

distinction between what is the element and what are the

16

facts that helped to prove the element, the element as

defined by the legislature.

18

Then once you answer that question, you have a

19

second question which is, did the legislature define the

element in a rational way?

Did Congress -- is

QUESTION:

should rationality include --

include whether it -- it simply deprives the jury of its

historic function?

7

-- you could dispense with the unanimity requirement of

the jury by charging -- enacting new statutes for a series

I think if you

crime, and a number of things happened, he turned into the

QUESTION:

happiest adverb there because rationally suggests there

12

Congress' end is to, you know, catch as many of these

people as possible and send them to prison, then they're

14

probably going to define the thing in such a way that the

MR. GORNSTEIN:

10

Well, first of all, I don't

think this, for the reasons that I've said, that this is

the same as an habitual offender statute.

Mr. Gornstein, it just occurred to

Well, your position that you can sort

MR. GORNSTEIN:

No, but I think if they all

No, I think that you did agree

that there was -- that they were the same in this sense.

That was the -- the very

10

all the acts were undertaken pursuant to that single

conduct in that sense.

QUESTION:

Well, maybe what you're suggesting to

us is that we ought to decide how far the means/ends

difficult, if at all, it -- it makes the -- it makes it

to defend a conspiracy case.

And you're

That's correct.

So, is the -- is the implicit

criterion that the limiting principle on what is possible

MR. GORNSTEIN:

I understand that, Justice --

I'm just saying that to the extent that what's being

raised is a notice objection, that the fact that this --

you get the same notice that you get on a conspiracy

18

I realize there is a separate question that

needs to be asked and answered about the unanimity
