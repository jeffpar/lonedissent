ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. JONES:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
In 1978, this Court held in the Zenith Radio

12

case that substantial deference should be given to

13

Treasury interpretations of the Tariff Act.

14

present case, the Federal circuit, without even citing

15

Zenith Radio, held precisely to the contrary and concluded

16

that no deference should be given to Treasury

17

interpretation.

18

directed the Court of International Trade to reach the

19

correct decision in customs cases and that this statutory

20

obligation was inconsistent with affording any deference

21

to Treasury interpretations.

22

In the

The court concluded that a 1980 statute

Respondent has abandoned that reasoning in this

23

Court, and the reasoning of the court of appeals is

24

manifestly incorrect.

25

appeals relied is 28 U.S.C. 2643(b).

The statute on which the court of

1

provides procedural options for the Court of International

2

Trade in situations where the evidence presented to that

3

court is not sufficient for it to reach the correct

4

decision.

5

In adopting the statute in 1980, the legislative

6

history made clear that Congress merely intended to

7

provide to the Court of International Trade the same kind

8

of remand and retrial authority possessed generally by

9

Federal district courts.

Certainly nothing in the history

10

of that provision reflects any intention by Congress to

11

abandon the principle of deference to Treasury

12

interpretations that this Court had articulated only 2

13

years prior to that date.

QUESTION:

interpretive regulations or legislative regulations?

16
17

Well, is -- are these supposed to be

MR. JONES:

These are -- the regulations that

are at issue in this case are interpretive regulations.

QUESTION:

19

then what they have is the power to persuade but not the

20

power to control.

our view.

to be given no deference, was in effect a null and void

6

International Trade was supposed to reach the correct

7

decision.

The Federal circuit concluded that they could

Well,

I mean, you'd think -- if -- if

it's an interpretive regulation and therefore it has the

10

legal force that - - whatever is given to the power to

11

persuade, though not the power to control.

12

an expert body like the Treasury that knows a lot about

13

it, you would give a lot of deference.

14

were an expert body that knew just as much about it, then

15

why would they have some special power to persuade?

16

MR. JONES:

When you have

Except, if you

Well, if -- if by the expert body

17

you're referring to you're referring to the Court of

18

International Trade, the Court of International Trade is a

19

specialized court just like the Tax Court, and the Tax

20

Court, just like the Court of International Trade, has

21

been directed by this Court in decisions such as National

22

Muffler Dealers and for the Court of International Trade

23

in the Zenith Radio case to defer to the agency's

24

reasonable interpretation.

Mr. Jones, did you agree with the

premise that -- that for interpretive regulations, we

2

accord the agency only the power to persuade and not to

control?

I -- I thought we --

4

MR. JONES:

5

QUESTION:

I --- the power to control so long as it

6

was -- it's within the range of the ambiguity.

7

if we thought that another interpretation might be better,

8

we would go along with the agency.

MR. JONES:

No.

And even

Is --

Clearly -- clearly you have

10

more fairly described the actual standard that the Court

11

has applied, and when I didn't bicker with --

this Court said it should in Zenith Radio which is to

QUESTION:

-- which is not quite Chevron.

And

2

then Justice Breyer brought up interpretive regulations,

3

which sounds to me like Skidmore.

4

degree of deference is it?

5

MR. JONES:

So, which kind of which

You're asking a question that I

6

think it's fair to say the Court has never answered, which

7

is in this -- there -- there's a high Chevron and a low

8

Chevron, and then there's in between that hasn't been

9

fully elaborated by the Court.

10

The high Chevron is where the agency is given an

11

express authority to interpret a particular statutory

12

provision and makes a substantive legislative rule.

13

then it's to be treated as valid if it's not arbitrary and

14

capricious and clearly inconsistent with the statute.

15

And

There's a low Chevron that doesn't require any

16

statutory authority to adopt rules.

17

the implied authority of the agency to interpret and

18

implement the statute that Congress has designated for it

19

to administer.

20

It's based simply on

What we have here and also in the Internal

21

Revenue Code is something in between.

We have an express

22

statutory authority to issue rules generally.

23

example, 19 U.S.C. 1624 is -- provides a general authority

24

to the Treasury to adopt any necessary rules under the

25

Tariff Act.

imagined.

MR. JONES:

the temptation to vulcanize --

QUESTION:

Well, I think the Court has resisted

I really had thought there was -- I

had really thought there was just one, and I thought

10

Skidmore was pre-Chevron and speaks from an era that --

11

that simply bygone.

I -- I --

12

MR. JONES:

13

academic than a practical way.

14

think which is the way the Court has addressed it,

15

basically there are two standards.

16

of what I call the high Chevron standard, which is perhaps

17

the Skidmore test you're referring to, which is when the

18

agency has specific rulemaking power granted by Congress

19

for a specific subject.

20

I may be referring to this in a more
As a practical way, I

There is the standard

That's the high deference.

The lower deference in Chevron doesn't require

21

any specific grant of statutory power.

It's based on what

22

the Court described in Chevron as the implied authority to

23

interpret and implement a scheme when Congress has told

24

the agency to administer it.

QUESTION:

At any rate, are you saying that the

interpretive -- the authority of the Treasury in this

2

Customs area is identical to its authority in the Internal

3

- - for the Internal Revenue Code?

4

MR. JONES:

It -- I -- well, it's more than

5

that.

There's a parallel provision.

6

referred to is parallel to the general interpretive

7

authority in the Internal Revenue Code.
In addition, there is a specific interpretive

authority for classification issues which, of course, this

10

case involves.

11

rules and regulations for the classification of goods,

12

classification and assessment of tariffs.

13

It authorizes the Treasury adopting the

Now, respondent's new argument, the one that he

14

didn't make below but is presenting to this Court, is that

15

-- that this -- that a statutory authority to issue the

16

classification rules is limited in 1502 by a clause at the

17

end of it which says, classification rules at the port --

18

various ports of entry.

And respondent, without any

19

authority whatever, says that just reading that, they can

20

tell that that means that it doesn't permit rules that

21

apply to importers, that it only applies to Customs

22

officers.

23

inconsistent with the longstanding principle of this Court

24

since 1809 in Vowell and M'Clean that tariff duties only

25

arise at the ports of entry, in the words of that opinion.

Well, that's illogical and it's also

9

SUITE 400

1

So, a rule that classifies goods at the ports of entry

2

applies directly to importers because that's where the

3

duties arise, that's where the goods are classified and

4

valued, and where the duties are assessed.

5

Respondent's new argument -- I think I should,

6

you know, put it in -- in its framework.

Respondent's new

7

argument is that because the Court of International Trade

8

is to make a de novo determination of liability, that that

9

is inconsistent with giving deference to the Treasury's

10

interpretation of the legal issues involved in the case.

11

In fact, respondent goes so far as to say that

12

whenever a court is to make a de novo determination of

13

liability, it is to ignore agency regulations even when

14

Congress has expressly authorized the agency to adopt

15

interpretive rules.

16

and it's flatly inconsistent with general case law of this

17

Court and, in particular, it's inconsistent with the

18

customs and tax litigation.

19

That -- that suggestion is radical

In customs and tax cases, Federal courts have

20

long been charged with the responsibility of making

21

independent factual determinations, of making

22

determinations of law and applying the facts to the law to

23

determine ultimately independently the amount of tax or

24

customs duty owed.

25

The Court of Federal Claims does it, the Court of

The Federal district courts do that.

QUESTION:

They all have

Mr. Jones, suppose you had a statute

that said in so many words the court shall decide the

5

question de novo.

MR. JONES:

QUESTION:

8

9

If -- you know -Might not -- might not the -- the

respondent's disposition apply in that situation?
MR. JONES:

Well, no, and -- and certainly I

10

want to address that, but I also want to point out that

11

they cited a Law Review article authored by you for that

12

proposition.

13

what one sees is that the article said that if Congress

14

directed the courts not to give any deference to the

15

agency and provided for de novo review, that's -- that's

16

-- the difference is that in providing for de novo review,

17

Congress has not told the agencies to ignore the courts.

18

In fact, Zenith Radio is exactly that kind of a case, as

19

is Atlantic Mutual, which the Court decided last term.

And if one looks at that Law Review article,

QUESTION:

6

It may be -- it may be that this is

Yes.
-- I assume that you would argue, but

there is a difference.
MR. JONES:

Yes, and the difference would be, as

7

you pointed out, to suggest even greater deference would

8

be owed to the agency's formal interpretation set forth in

9

an interpretive rule.

And, indeed, this interpretive

10

rule, that we will address later on in this argument, was

11

issued as a result of notice and comment procedures.

12

QUESTION:

Can I ask you one quick question

13

about that?

14

But the Treasury, of course, is in charge of our tax laws,

15

and basically when you write a new law, the first place

16

Congress gets the law from is the Treasury.

They run

17

right over.

They're --

18

they're part of the legislative process.

19

This is something I don't know the answer to.

They're talking to each other.

Now, is Treasury in the same relationship to the

customs laws?

impression there's the GATT in there.

See, their whole argument is --

MR. JONES:

You're asking a question that I

think might be beyond my ability to answer.
QUESTION:

Maybe we should take evidence on

5

this.

Do you think we should take evidence on how -- how

much involved the agency is with the enactment of the law?

Do you think it makes any difference?
MR. JONES:

9

is - QUESTION:

10
11

I think what makes a difference

Do you want us to give more deference

if the agency is intimately involved?
MR. JONES:

12

I just want the Court to -- to

repeat what it held in Zenith Radio, which is that the

14

standard amount of deference is owed to these regulations

that are - QUESTION:

16

Mr. Jones, do we also owe deference

in this area to interpretations by the U.S. Trade

Representative or by the International Trade Commission?
MR. JONES:

19

No.

In enacting the Harmonized

20

Tariff Schedule in 1988, Congress noted the different

21

roles performed by the various entities, and it

22

specifically said that the role of interpreting and

23

applying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule was designated to

24

the Customs Service, which works, of course, for the

Treasury.

Mr. Jones, on Zenith Radio, I think

that the respondent has said, well, that's for

MR. JONES:

5

Respondent has done a good job of -

- of fairly confusing something that's really very clear.

What is very clear is that up through the time that Zenith

Now, the regulation in saying that significant

The Government suggests to you that the -- this

you that this is a case of no Chevron.

that is that you cannot determine whether or not any kind

I submit to

And the reason for

other statutory schemes.
In order to decide in a particular case whether

11
12

or not respect is due to the regulations or

13

interpretations of the particular agency, it's absolutely

14

essential to examine the source of regulatory authority,

15

the nature of the judicial proceeding that Congress

16

provided for, and in this case take a very hard look at

17

the regulation itself because it expresses as plainly, as

18

anything can, the very limited nature of the authority

19

that Customs purported to exercise in this particular

20

context.

21

And if you follow those three sources of law,

22

they all point in precisely the same direction, which is

23

that Customs never has had, in the 200 years of its

24

existence, the kind of authority that the Government

admission are things like inspections, what's required to

I think that's a gross

And you say, these goods didn't come

the real problem was they did the permapressing in Mexico

And then you later

Now, the fact you can make that argument in the

with the question of whether a regulation that relates to

permapressing shall be given deference.

It just seems to

me they're two entirely different ball games.
MR. PHILLIPS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Solicitor General points to, which is review of IRS

protests, you have to identify the precise grounds and you

are stuck with the precise grounds that you've identified.

All I'm saying is that this -- this is to my mind the

10

broadest, perhaps the most breathtaking, de novo

proceeding that I know about.

12

QUESTION:

But when you answered Justice

13

Stevens' question and my question, why isn't this a

preeminent case for applying at least a uniform source of

15

law on which we can then make a de novo determination

16

based on the facts?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, there's two answers to

18

that.

19

an entire scheme of de novo review is that it does not

20

look to the enforcing agency as the source of uniformity.

21

One is the inference to draw when Congress creates

So, de novo doesn't mean you just

decide as an original proposition for yourself what the

7

law is if other courts which are above you in the

8

hierarchy have said differently.

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's -- that's clearly the case

10

and that's the fair inference you'd draw from the -- from

11

the statutory scheme Congress has created of - - of

12

appellate review.

13

But the question is, what inference do you draw

14

from a scheme of extraordinary de novo review coupled with

15

a remarkably narrow grant of rulemaking authority?

16

And let's remember, there are five provisions

17

that were cited in the adoption of these regulations, and

18

each one of them points to the ability to bind Customs or

19

to bind individual employees of the particular service.

20

And the Government only discusses essentially 1502 and, in

21

doing that, reads out of the statute ports of entry, that

22

language, which I submit to you is terribly important.

MR. PHILLIPS:

If you contrast that language,

but the term, ports of entry, isn't included in the grants

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

compelling arbitrariness of this regulation arises in the

different treatment of the pants that Haggar has itself
