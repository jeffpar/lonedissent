ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. ATWOOD

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

MR. ATWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The two consolidated courses -- cases here arose

12

from uranium mining and milling activity that occurred on

13

the Navajo reservation some 40 years ago.

14

or their predecessors produced this uranium under licenses

15

and contracts with the Atomic Energy Commission and sold

16

it to the Government under the Government's uranium

17

procurement program.

18

military purposes.

The petitioners

All of the uranium was used for

Some decades after the uranium operations closed

20

down, my clients were sued in Navajo Tribal Court by the

21

respondents.

22

Tribe, and they claim that from long-term exposure to

23

uranium and other hazardous properties produced by the

24

petitioners' operations, they suffered injury.

25

in tribal court were pleaded entirely under tribal law.

The respondents are members of the Navajo

The claims

It is our basic contention in this case that

1

2

claims of nuclear tort such as those raised by respondents

3

must be heard under Federal law and that, under the

4

relevant Federal law, the defendants are entitled to a

5

Federal forum.
Congress visited this issue of nuclear torts on

6

7

more than a half-dozen occasions over the last 40 years,

8

and in the Atomic Energy Act itself, in the Price-Anderson
provisions of the Atomic Energy Act, Congress developed a

10

rather elaborate set of procedural and substantive rules

11

to govern how nuclear torts should be treated.

12

rules reflect a legislative judgment on how to balance the

13

public's need for safety, the public's need for

14

compensation if safety is lacking, on the one hand, and

15

the national need for a domestic uranium industry that is

16

not subject to uncontrolled, unstructured tort liability.

17

QUESTION:

And these

I'm concerned, Mr. Atwood, frankly,

18

with the procedural posture of this case.

20

said Price-Anderson Act claims could not proceed in tribal

21

court.

MR. ATWOOD:

QUESTION:

4

By you, by petitioners, and the Ninth

Circuit decided a question that wasn't appealed.
MR. ATWOOD:

By petitioners.

As well as a question that was

appealed, that's correct.

Well, and it didn't decide other

questions.

question that wasn't appealed?

11

MR. ATWOOD:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

Should we just

No.

We would certainly hope --

I mean, I would think we would do

that.
MR. ATWOOD:

I -- we agree the Court should

15

vacate that portion of the court of appeals decision that

16

allowed Price-Anderson cases to proceed in tribal court

17

because in our view --

18

QUESTION:

That wasn't appealed.

19

MR. ATWOOD:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. ATWOOD:

22

But what was appealed, and which is therefore

-- that issue was not appealed.
Right.
That's correct.

23

proper -- the court had jurisdiction over, and this Court

24

has jurisdiction, over the question whether the tribal law

25

claims could properly proceed.

3

QUESTION:

But the court, the Ninth Circuit

didn't really deal with that, did it?
MR. ATWOOD:

It affirmed the denial of a

4

preliminary injunction that we requested.

5

order does allow, incorrectly, in our view, the tribal law

6

claims to proceed in tribal court.

7

properly before the court of appeals jurisdictionally.

8

They decided it wrongly.
QUESTION:

10

11

It -- so its

That issue was

I thought it really didn't get to the

merits of that.
MR. ATWOOD:

No, it -- it decided two issues.

12

It affirmed the denial of the injunction that we sought,

13

and it reversed sua sponte the grant of the other part of

14

the injunction that we sought.

15

very important substantive issue that came up properly

16

jurisdictionally, and that is the question, were the

17

tribal law claims preempted by the Price-Anderson Act.

18

QUESTION:

So there's clearly one

appeals reversed and it was not appealed, in a sense, it's

You don't have the duty to appeal a

MR. ATWOOD:

QUESTION:

Right.
On the other hand, the court of

that the unappealed ruling and its rationale are logically

necessary for its decision on the part that is appealed.

2

I'm not quite sure what the court of appeals should

3

done.

4

MR. ATWOOD:

have

Well, there -- I think there is a

5

distinction between what orders were before the court and

6

what orders are before this Court, and therefore what the

7

relief should be, with the question of how broad the

8

analysis needs to be to properly decide the issues that

9

are before the Court.

And it is perfectly understandable,

10

I think, that the Ninth Circuit and this Court, in

11

deciding the preemption issues that are presented, would

12

want to analyze the totality of the relationship of the

13

Price-Anderson Act regime with what has happened in this

14

case.

15

So it is certainly possible that the substantive

16

analysis would be somewhat broad, but then when you get

17

down to an appropriate relief, in our judgment it should

18

be to reverse the court of appeals insofar as it allowed

19

the tribal court causes of action to go forward and to

20

vacate the court of appeals judgment insofar as it

21

prohibited Price-Anderson claims from going forward.

22

We

Mr. Atwood, let me tell you my

problem with that.

decide a question which, in the light of the question that

2

you want us to forego, may well be utterly academic.
That is to say, if Price-Anderson claims can be

3

brought in tribal court, contrary to the injunction here

4

that you want us to leave in place, if they can be brought

5

in tribal court, then it makes no difference -- it is

6

asking an academic question whether you will allow the

7

tribal court to consider and will allow it to exhaust

8

whether a particular claim is a Price-Anderson claim or

9

not a Price-Anderson claim.

10

That question is a nonquestion if both claims

11

can be brought in tribal court, and you don't want us to

12

reach the question of whether both claims can be brought

13

in tribal court.

14

injunction wasn't appealed, so forget about that question.

15

You say that's been decided, and that

But unless that question is answered in the

16

opposite way from the way the district court answered it,

17

namely, answered to say you cannot bring -- I'm sorry, you

18

can -- you -- yes -- no -- the way the district court

19

answered it.

20

MR. ATWOOD:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, the -- right.
You cannot bring Price-Anderson

22

claims in tribal court, then the question of whether a

23

particular claim is Price-Anderson or not Price-Anderson

24

never arises, and why should we sit here and deliberate on

25

that question, and ask whether the tribal court can decide

1

that question, and it must be exhausted, when it may well

2

be a question that never arises?
MR. ATWOOD:

3

Well, there certainly are

4

differences, though, substantively, in how a tribal law

5

claim would proceed and how a Price-Anderson claim would

6

proceed.

7

Also, let me say we're not --

8

QUESTION:

What are -- are you going to tell us

what they are?
MR. ATWOOD:

10

Yes, I'd be happy to.

Well,

11

assuming you could have a Price-Anderson claim in tribal

12

court?

QUESTION:

MR. ATWOOD:

QUESTION:

16

MR. ATWOOD:

Yes.
Which we don't think you can have.
Right, but assume -If there could be Price-Anderson

17

claims in tribal court, again which we do not agree with,

18

Federal standards of care would be relevant.

cases, not this one, there would be indemnity issues that

20

would be relevant.
QUESTION:

21

In other

So you're saying that borrowing --

22

borrowing in tribal law does not explain all that's going

23

on.

24

you're going to have something beyond just borrow tribal

law so the two actions are not identical.

They are not -- indeed,

you would not borrow tribal law under Price-Anderson.

MR. ATWOOD:

So the issue -Arizona law would apply in tribal

court, not tribal law.
QUESTION:

7

So the issue will arise in tribal

8

court even if -- even if Price-Anderson actions are

9

allowable in tribal court, tribal courts will still have

10

to decide whether a particular claim is Price-Anderson or

11

not Price-Anderson?
MR. ATWOOD:

12

If Price-Anderson claims were

13

properly held in tribal court, that would be a judgment

14

the tribal court would have to reach.

15

tribal courts --

not - QUESTION:

I just don't want to decide

20

something, you know, that may be irrelevant if Price-

21

Anderson can be brought in tribal court.

22

MR. ATWOOD:

And it may be that what is

necessary because of the procedural errors of the Ninth

Circuit -- we're not opposed to this Court deciding all

for.
We're not opposing a full resolution of the

3

preemption and jurisdictional issues, but we did think it

4

was necessary to bring to the Court's attention what we

5

perceive to be a jurisdictional error in the court of

appeals, and that obviously can have implications for the

scope of the ruling of this case.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, could the court of appeals have

said, we're going to resolve the tribal claim issues, and

10

in light of that resolution the district court must have

11

been wrong in its injunction, assuming it came out that

way.

Then what does it do?

the issue would come back up to the court of appeals

QUESTION:

MR. ATWOOD:

And on who wins.
And what the respondents want to

12

do.

They have so far, at least up until this phase of the

13

litigation, eschewed Price-Anderson claims.

14

very clear in saying, we want to proceed solely under

15

tribal law, we're not interested in pursuing under Price-

16

Anderson, and they demonstrated that by not appealing the

17

injunction against proceeding under Price-Anderson, so we

18

are dealing with potential future events.

19

They were

But it does seem to us clear under the statute

20

that Price-Anderson preempts the tribal law claims.

21

congressional language is absolute in saying, any claim

22

for nuclear torts such as this may be brought only under

23

the terms of Price-Anderson, and four courts of appeals

24

have all decided that that language preempts State law

25

claims.

MR. ATWOOD:

QUESTION:
All right.

They did not.
All right -- they didn't even mention

it.

Now it comes to the district court, and

5

the district court says, your motion for an injunction --

that is, yours -- is denied.

MR. ATWOOD:

8

QUESTION:

9

They denied it.

In part.
Well, they denied it, and then he

adds the words to the order, except insofar as the

10

defendant seeks relief under the Price-Anderson Act in

11

tribal court, which he hadn't done.

12

So since he'd never -- since -- the only way I

13

can imagine to read that is that the exception's

irrelevant, because he didn't.

Well, I think what that -And then it comes to the court of

Well, but -- no, that leaves out a

series of important errors that the court of appeals made

concluded that it was necessary for us to exhaust tribal

remedies on the question of whether or not tribal law

claims were proper, and that's where we and the United

States strongly disagree.

They

Price-Anderson clearly preempts those claims,
10

and with respect to those claims there should be no

exhaustion requirement because it would be very wasteful

12

and it would frustrate this congressional scheme of having

13

Price-Anderson nuclear tort claims, that is, all of which

Thank you, Mr. Atwood.

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The parties agree that the Federal courts have
Federal question jurisdiction to decide at some point

10

whether these nuclear tort claims brought initially under

11

tribal law fall within the preemptive scope of the Price-

12

Anderson Act.

13

rule of tribal court exhaustion delays the date on which

14

the Federal courts will decide that issue, even though, as

15

Justice Ginsburg points out, if this suit had been filed

16

in State court, the Federal courts would indisputably

17

decide that issue now.

18

The question here is whether the prudential

The answer is that the tribal exhaustion

19

doctrine does not have that anomalous consequence, and the

20

reason is specific to the Price-Anderson Act.

21

The act deems any claim for public liability

22

brought under any source of law to be a Federal claim

23

arising directly under Price-Anderson.

Congress took that step because it wanted to

2

3

make nuclear tort litigation more predictable, more

4

uniform, and more efficient, because it wanted to ensure

5

consolidation of any related cases, and because it wished

6

to ensure centralized control over compensation claims.

case comes here?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

8

9

One option this Court has is

to reverse the Ninth Circuit on the threshold exhaustion

10

issue, and to remand to the lower courts for a substantive

11

determination as to whether respondents' claims in fact

12

fall within the preemptive scope of the Price-Anderson

13

Act.

14

If they do, then those claims are properly

15

litigated in Federal court.

17

the suit.

If they do not, then it may

I was going to -- you may have

19

touched on what I was going to ask, but I'm not sure that

20

I understand your argument for complete preemption,

21

because I thought your argument for complete preemption

22

was, Congress has clearly decided that these things ought

23

to be resolved in Federal forums, and yet one of the

24

issues before us, albeit one that was not passed on by the

25

lower courts, was whether this particular -- whether the

1

claims here fall within the concept of public liability.

2

I mean, I was going to say, isn't the argument

3

essentially circular, because there's no way we can deal

4

with the exhaustion issue without -- or any court can,

5

without first dealing with the issue of whether the claims

6

here are within the umbrella of public liability.

7

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

I disagree with that.

8

Congress anticipated there would be circumstances where

9

the parties would disagree about whether the Price-

10

Anderson Act is applicable, and whether Price-Anderson

11

rules would therefore apply.

12

like that to be in Federal court from -- if -- at the

13

election of the defendant.

14

QUESTION:

Congress wanted any dispute

Why didn't -- if it's as simple as

that, why didn't it simply provide for a broad removal

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That's correct, and it is

22

probably the case that Congress was simply not thinking

23

about tribal courts when it enacted this law, so the

24

question then is, would it -- would it violate

congressional intent to permit Price-Anderson suits to

persist in tribal court, despite what appears to be a

2

clear statutory preference for having all Price-Anderson

3

claims litigated in Federal court.

4

QUESTION:

Of course, if we -- in answering that

5

question, if we say, well, Congress is presumed to know

6

the way, you know, the courts do business, I think your

7

position would run up against this difficulty, and that is

8

that the instances that you point to outside of PriceAnderson for the concept of what you call complete

10

preemption in your brief were, I think -- and correct me

11

if I'm wrong -- all instances in which there was an

12

express removal provision.

13

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That's correct, but by

14

enacting a complete preemption statute Congress signals

15

its intent to have all litigation within a particular

16

sphere to occur in Federal court and also --

17

QUESTION:

Yes, but your examples of complete

18

preemption prior to this case are all examples in which

1

there is a removal provision, is that not correct?

20

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

But the point here is that

21

there is no need for a removal provision, because

22

everybody agrees the Federal courts have Federal question

23

jurisdiction to address --

24
25

QUESTION:

Sure, but that begs the question of

exhaustion.

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

1

No, it doesn't beg the

2

question of exhaustion, because again, the very process of

3

exhausting tribal remedies in this context would frustrate

4

this statutory scheme.
The whole point of the statutory scheme is to

5
6

give defendants an absolute right to choose a Federal

7

forum for litigation, not just of claims that are deemed

8

to be within Price-Anderson, but also of any threshold
dispute about whether claims in fact fall within Price-

10

Anderson.

That is clearly the congressional intent, and

11

the question here -QUESTION:

12

And you say this is the congressional

13

intent without reference to this background set of cases

14

that exemplify complete exhaustion under other statutory

15

regimes.

16

Price-Anderson Act alone.

17

You say that conclusion can be drawn from the

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That conclusion clearly

18

follows from the Price-Anderson Act, and you can tell that

1

but not just from the enactment of a removal provision,

20

but also from Congress' taking the extra step of deeming

21

any action asserting public liability to be a claim

22

arising within the scope of the Price-Anderson Act itself.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Nuechterlein, is there any clue

24

that Congress contemplated tribes at all, because when it

25

talked about how the substantive law would be shaped, it

mentioned State law.

2

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

3

QUESTION:

4
5

That is correct.

It provided for removal, but it seems

that it just wasn't thinking about the tribes.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

That is correct, and it is

6

significant that Congress provided that substantive State

7

law would apply in Price-Anderson suits.

8

may be different from the law that tribes would apply, and
on top of that,

10
11

That, of course,

it's also important to remember that the

removal statute itself was originally enacted in 1 66.
The 1 88 amendments expanded the scope of the

12

removal statute to extend beyond extraordinary nuclear

13

occurrences to include all nuclear incidents, of which we

14

claim these suits are an example, but there's no

15

indication anywhere in the legislative history that

16

Congress contemplated that tribal courts would adjudicate

17

these claims.

18

And the important point also is that tribal

1

court adjudication of these claims without any mechanism

20

for transfer to a Federal court which would have

21

centralized control over the litigation and centralized

22

control over compensation funds would present all of the

23

problems that motivated Congress in 1 88 to expand the

24

removal provision at issue here.

25

frustrate this statutory scheme to permit suits to proceed

It would clearly

1

in tribal court over the objection of the defendant.
Ultimately, on the merits issue the parties

2

3

address, we agree with petitioners that these tort suits

4

do, in fact, fall within the scope of the Price-Anderson

5

Act.

6

definitions of nuclear incident and public liability as

7

they appear in section 2014.

That follows from the plain language of the

QUESTION:

8

9

But you agree that that question

should get a first view by a lower court.
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

10

I think that is one

11

appropriate disposition, although the answer to the

12

question is clear enough to us that I think that it would

13

also be appropriate for this Court to decide it in the

14

first instance.
QUESTION:

15

If we reverse on the ground that

16

exhaustion is not required, what does the Ninth Circuit do

17

with reference to the unappealed order?
MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

18

Well, that -- that unappealed

19

order would remain intact if this Court were to apply

20

ordinary jurisdictional rules, so ultimately what might

21

happen is, respondents would return to district court to

22

claim that, notwithstanding any answer to the question of

23

whether these claims fall within Price-Anderson, that a

24

tribal court may nonetheless adjudicate Price-Anderson

25

claims.

They would ask the district court at that point

to lift that preliminary injunction and would then

2

litigate that issue on the merits.
QUESTION:

3

And what's the Government's position

4

on the merits question of whether you can bring Price-

5

Anderson claims in the tribal courts?

6

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Our position is that it would

7

be inconsistent with the whole point of the scheme to

8

allow these suits to proceed over the objection of a

9

defendant in tribal courts, because that would present

10

exactly the same litigation problems that motivated

11

Congress to enact the 1988 amendments.
QUESTION:

12

13

But absent objection, do they have

jurisdiction?

14

MR. NUECHTERLEIN:

Yes, in the same way that

State courts would have jurisdiction in the absence of an

objection from the defendant.

of the Price-Anderson Act and the doctrine of tribal

exhaustion.
First of all, the decision below carried forth

both Congress' policy of respecting the jurisdiction of

allowing tribal plaintiffs to choose tribal courts as a

That policy is reflected in the absence of removal

I think the court of

whether it had the power to render it, but I think in fact

17

by addressing both the unappealed part of the order and

18

the appealed part of the order the Ninth Circuit came out

1

in the right place.

20

In addition to this respect for the right of

21

tribal courts and tribal plaintiffs, what the court did

22

was avoid the problem of having litigants running back and

23

forth between the Federal and the tribal courts, which is

24

a central idea behind the idea --

other end of the spectrum, too.

2

MR. FARR:

QUESTION:

I say, you could avoid running back

4

and forth between tribal courts and Federal courts at the

5

other end of the spectrum, too, and say that the -- rule

6

against your contentions in all respects.

7
8

MR. FARR:

That would be true, but the fact is

that the tribal exhaustion doctrine in its basic core
element is intended to say, unless there is a clear lack

10

of jurisdiction in the tribal courts, the idea is that the

11

issues with respect to jurisdiction are considered first

12

by the tribal court and then subsequently by the Federal

13

court, and that's exactly the regime that the Ninth

14

Circuit decision restores in this case.

15

At the end of the district court proceedings,

16

essentially you had a case that was half in Federal court

17

with the issue that petitioners were appealing being left

18

essentially to the tribal courts, and half in Federal

1

court with the issue that the respondents did not appeal

20

being part of the Federal decision-making.

21

So in the end it seems to me that, confronted

22

with a split case, the Ninth Circuit did what would make

23

the most sense, assuming it had the power to do it, which

24

is to say, let's let the tribal courts decide both of

25

these issues in the first place.

And one particular point I think that bears on

2

that is that if, in fact, the district court is incorrect

3

that tribal courts lack power over Price-Anderson actions,

4

then, in fact, the other question, the question that

5

petitioners were asking the Ninth Circuit to consider, is

irrelevant to jurisdiction.

not for purposes of determining tribal court jurisdiction,

QUESTION:

That is to

say, what possible reason could Congress have if --

quite clearly the kind of thing that Price Anderson is

concerned about.

every State action, of which there would be thousands, the

defendants can remove to Federal court immediately.

That's absolutely clear Congress wants that to happen.

Now, what reason could Congress have for saying

in such a case that although we got all these actions in

be that Congress would have wanted to take all those cases

out of State court, which, by the way, are very used to

MR. FARR:

This is why I think the example does

make a difference.

The general practice of Congress is to

19

allow tribal plaintiffs to choose the tribal court forum

20

for events that arise on tribal lands, so if you look at

21

any of the other cases in which there are Federal

22

jurisdiction, Federal question jurisdiction under section

Do you think, Mr. Farr, that was a

specifically, or generally?
QUESTION:

Generally, because you make the

9

general point that, unlike most plaintiffs, tribal

10

plaintiffs don't have to worry about the defendant

11

removing even if there's diversity jurisdiction.

12

MR. FARR:

That's right.

I'm not sure that the

13

decision at first was deliberate, Justice Stevens.

But I

14

think that by now the idea that cases are not removable

15

from tribal court is a familiar principle, and certainly

16

Congress has not revisited that.

17

And also in the most specific example that we

18

have, after a Federal court of appeals held that a suit

19

against a Federal officer in tribal court was not

20

removable, the Justice Department asked the Congress, in

21

fact, to amend the removal statute to provide -- that

22

would be 1442 -- to provide for removal in those cases,

23

and Congress did not enact it, so I think the idea that

Congress did not -- that Congress thought it was a bad

2

idea?

3

MR. FARR:

It doesn't necessarily prove that.

4

QUESTION:

It doesn't.

5

MR. FARR:

What I'm suggesting, though, is that

6

Congress seems, by not providing in any situation for

7

removal from tribal court, in the end to be suggesting a

8

special solicitude for tribal plaintiffs to choose tribal

9

courts as their forum.

10

Congress has demonstrated a concern for the

11

tribal courts themselves, of course, and then in addition

12

to that it seems to me that in the cases where you have

13

injuries arising on tribal lands, and the injured parties

14

are tribal members, that Congress reasonably would think,

15

consistent with that policy, that those suits should be

16

brought in tribal court.

17

QUESTION:

So that's --

18

QUESTION:

When you say, injuries on tribal

lands, what particularly was the allegation of the

20

complaint here, that there was some activity of the

21

defendants on tribal lands?

MR. FARR:

That's correct.

In one

cases they are open pit uranium mines.

the injuries are said to arise from the -- essentially the

abandonment of the pits, and they're filling up with

QUESTION:

First of

Wait, I can put you on easier ground,

15

I think, and I think you may have this -- because suppose

I thought -- let's assume I do think this, which I think I

17

do basically, that if Congress had a statute, that statute

18

says, look, this is a certain kind of action, we do not

19

want this ever brought in a State court.

We want this

20

brought in Federal court no matter what.

Never, never,

21

never bring it in a State court, and they simply happen to

forget saying, and by the way, we mean tribal courts, too.

me long to say, they want it brought in Federal court,

2

But that isn't our case, because our case is a

3

case where there's one set of things that fall within the

statute that we'll imagine says that, but the question,

take it, here is, and if you have some instances where it

isn't clear whether you have this kind of an action or not

7

this kind of an action, who's to decide that?

8

MR. FARR:

Well, that's true, and --

QUESTION:

And so what's your argument there?

Assume with me,

10

I

in other words, contrary to your

11

interests, that in the clear case, a Price-Anderson case,

in the absence of such language.
MR. FARR:

That's correct, but the point that

3

I'm making, and back again to Justice Breyer's question,

4

is that it seems to me instructive that the failure to

5

provide for removal from tribal courts in this case is not

6

an exception to the Congress' normal practice of providing

7

for removal from tribal courts.

8

To the contrary.

If, in fact, one thought removal was necessary
in this case, either directly or through some sort of

10

second-hand removal creation by a combination of the 1331

11

lawsuit, that would be the first time, in fact, that it

12

was ever attributed to Congress an intention to allow a

13

defendant to remove a case that was otherwise properly,

14

under all principles of Federal Indian law, within the

15

jurisdiction of the tribal court.

is a different

action from what you get with a removal petition.

QUESTION:

I think there is something different,

I understand talking in these abstract

categories, but you have conceded, if I read your brief

correctly, that if the tribal court plaintiffs claims are,

indeed, as Mr. Atwood tells us they are, public liability

claims, they cannot survive as something else.

is the Price-Anderson Act, does it cover mining, does it

1

were some things that involved, maybe fact determination,

2

maybe some input from tribal law, but here, the question

3

is, the sweep of the Price-Anderson Act has nothing to do

4

with anything other than how broad Congress wanted to make

5

that, and so why should the exhaustion requirement apply

6

to a question of what is the scope of a law passed by

7

Congress to govern nuclear incidents?

8

MR. FARR:

I think the answer to that, Justice

Goldburg, goes back to the basic idea why the exhaustion
10
11

doctrine exists at all.
I do not think that it is necessary that the

12

issue that is -- the jurisdictional issue that is part of

13

exhaustion be one that tribal courts have particular

14

expertise with regard to.

15

justify the tribal exhaustion doctrine under traditional

16

principles of comity that the suit was originally filed in

17

tribal court, and the tribal court has asserted

18

jurisdiction over it.

1331 cause of action.
What I'm saying is that I think the proper

3

application of the tribal exhaustion doctrine is

4

essentially to leave matters affecting the jurisdiction of

5

a tribal court to the tribal court in the first instance

6

when there is a pending tribal court proceeding.

7

is being asked in the 1331 proceeding is that a Federal

8

court take the highly unusual step of declaring that

And what

another court lacks jurisdiction over the claims it's
10
11

presently hearing.
It seems to me that, unless that lack of

12

jurisdiction in the tribal court is clear, then Federal

13

courts are really overstepping the proper bounds of

14

injunctive power under usual principles of comity.

15

Also, it does seem to me that one runs the risk

16

of having just what you have here.

17

pointed out earlier, you essentially have a case which

18

then goes up to a court of appeals essentially in a mixed

1

condition, because in our view the district court should

20

not have decided that tribal jurisdiction is foreclosed

over -- under public liability actions.

Farmers, that question was also properly left to the

1

MR. FARR:

That was not appealed, and let me

2

just say for one moment, I actually think that the court

3

of appeals did have jurisdiction to consider the

4

unappealed part of the order and to reverse that part.

5

That is a jurisdiction that should be sparingly

6

exercised, but I think the usual principles that say, once

7

a court acquires jurisdiction independently over a part of

8

a case, it then has jurisdiction over the entire case, and
the power to dispose of the entire case is essentially the

10
11

controlling principle here.
The decision in Morley is, I think, probably the

12

biggest obstacle to that point, but I think there are a

13

couple of responses to that.

14

at the cases cited in Morley, although Morley itself

15

certainly talks in terms of power, a number of the cases

16

talk in terms of waiver, or something amounting to a

17

waiver, or a loss of the right to insist on the appeal,

18

language which suggests really more about the loss of a

1

litigant's right to insist upon a decision and less --

20

goes less to the question of the power of the court.

21

QUESTION:

First of all, if one looks

Oh, but they're all categorical,

is -- and they're certainly as categorical as Morley was,

What they say

Well, to begin with, the case that

2

deals with the issue most directly, Langes, is categorical

3

the other way.
QUESTION:

4

Langes doesn't deal with the issue.

5

Langes, its discussion of this issue is dictum, because

6

what was involved was in fact not the failure to raise an

7

issue, but the failure to make an argument.

It wasn't --

8

MR. FARR:

Right.

I understand it's dictum.

QUESTION:

So anything it said was dictum, and

it has dictum on both sides.

they are all categorical when they say that you simply

12

can't do it.
MR. FARR:

13

As I read our prior cases,

Well, but the question is, are they

14

saying you can't do it because you lack the power to do

so?

explained the answer to the point I just made.

If so, those cases, it seems to me, have not

If courts generally can exercise pendent

it does have a basis of jurisdiction over the initial part

MR. FARR:

Well, let me suggest two things if I

10

may, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

generally dispute the idea that jurisdictional rules ought

12

to be clear, one of the difficulties is, in fact, that the

more rigorous the cross-appeal becomes, the more

5

I'm sorry.

Excuse me.

I do mean

6

respondents.

None of the claims that they had brought had

7

been deemed to be Price-Anderson claims, so in terms of a

8

practical effect, the injunction had none at that point.
It was a preliminary injunction.

It was subject

10

to review when made final, so in fact a cross-appeal here,

11

and obviously in retrospect it would have been much wiser

12

to have taken one, but a cross-appeal here would have

13

essentially caused them to go up to the court of appeals

14

and complain about an order that was causing them no

15

immediate harm.

16

QUESTION:

Why do you care?

I mean, you have

17

nothing in the complaint, or virtually nothing that

18

alleges violation of Price-Anderson.

1

your -- I thought all of them, but maybe there's one that

20

isn't -- that you seem to allege things like negligence,

21

et cetera, which you're saying don't fall within Price-

22

Anderson .

I mean, almost all

MR. FARR:

Well, I think --

QUESTION:

So why do you care?

points, and I think it's important to keep them clear.

2

Our -- we have a basic position which is, these claims are

simply not Price-Anderson claims.

scope of the claims -QUESTION:

Okay.

I see that.

question?

They are not within the

You want to say even if they were.
Let me -- can I ask you one other

8

MR. FARR:

But may I make --

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

10

MR. FARR:

-- just one final point.

I think if,

11

in fact, they are within the scope of Price-Anderson

12

claims, then I think there is a little bit of a

13

misunderstanding about what the effect of that is.

14

I don't think there is any requirement for

15

claims to be Price-Anderson claims, that they be pled as

16

Price-Anderson claims.

17

Anderson claims if they're within the terms of the act.

18

We say they're not, but if they are, the act, by its own

19

force, turns them into Price-Anderson claims.

20

QUESTION:

The act deems them to be Price-

Could you say one word on that, just

21

what -- I mean, I just don't want you to sit down without

22

saying one other thing.

23

have a chance to say it, but that the -- you look at the

24

Price-Anderson Act and it says, with respect to any public

25

liability action resulting from a nuclear incident,

I'll put it specifically so you

1

Federal courts have jurisdiction.

2

Then it defines a public liability action really

3

to be any action where somebody is claimed to owe money to

4

a member of the public arising out of a nuclear incident.

5

Then it defines nuclear incident to mean any occurrence

6

that causes sickness or death or injury arising from the

7

radioactive properties of nuclear material.

Well, QED.
we send it back?

What is there for them to decide if

What they're saying is, QED.

All the

10

claims in this complaint are Price-Anderson claims,

11

because they all allege injury arising -- to a member of

the public arising out of radioactive material.

13

the matter.

14

End of

Now, what's your response to that?

MR. FARR:

I think there are two real

15

problems -- excuse me -- with reading the language the way

16

that that would, frankly, naturally seem to be read.

17

wind up with two linguistic anomalies.

18

wind up with, under petitioner's reading, a public

19

liability action against defendants, who are not liable

20

for public liability.

21

You

First of all, you

The linchpin of a public liability action is

22

that it asserts public liability, but it isn't asserting

23

public liability against anybody who is responsible for

24

public liability in this case.

2

MR. FARR:

Right.

3

QUESTION:

All right, so why don't we say that?

4
5

That's what --

If you put it in that language, what's the problem?
MR. FARR:

But it has to be public liability --

6

the liability has to be on behalf of a defendant who is

7

liable for public liability.

QUESTION:

Well, they're saying there is a

They say, the El Paso Natural Gas Company

MR. FARR:

But the fact is, under the definition

12

of persons indemnified, which is 2014 (t), which includes

13

all persons who are possibly liable for public liability,

14

there has to be an indemnification agreement or financial

15

protection where that doesn't apply.

Mr. Farr, do you argue -- I just want

to be sure I get this question in.

Reading it in -- the language as it

moves through the definitions seems to lead to one

conclusion.

cannot come to the conclusion that you can have a public

public liability and furthermore --

QUESTION:

MR. FARR:

That would still be our position,

right.
And our second point, though, which also goes to

8

the language, is that the claim has to -- is deemed to
10

arise under section 2210.

The question is, what is there

11

in section 2210 that this claim arises under?
Section 2210 is a compensation scheme which

12

13

covers public liability, it channels public liability to

14

those persons having indemnification and in -- and

15

required insurance, and then it provides for suits to

recover within that scheme.

That's what section 2210

None of that applies here.

There's no required

There's no indemnity by the Government.
QUESTION:

Those are the questions about the

20

scope of Price-Anderson, and the question before us is,

21

who decides, and the very good argument that you are

22

making now, you're saying should be addressed in the first

23

instance to a tribal court and not to a Federal court.

MR. FARR:

Regardless of the fact that it

doesn't have a tribal court element, we still think that

when a litigant goes into Federal court and says, stop the

jurisdiction that is being exerted by this other court,

8

that unless the lack of jurisdiction in that other court

is clear both from jurisdictional and from substantive
