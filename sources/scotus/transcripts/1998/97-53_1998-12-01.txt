ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH H. MATTINGLY, III

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. MATTINGLY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

This case comes to this Court on the claim of

12

Wanda Johnson, a Kentucky resident, who claims that the

13

respondent hospital violated the antidumping provisions of

14

the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act

15

passed by Congress in 1986.

16

Ms. Johnson's claim was dismissed by the

17

district court on summary judgment.

18

upheld by the court of appeals on the sole issue of

19

whether or not the statute requires proof of an improper

20

motive on the part of the offending hospital as a

21

prerequisite for recovery.

22

on that specific issue and that specific issue only.

23

That dismissal was

This Court granted certiorari

The respondent in this case has conceded that it

24

can no longer defend the rationale of the lower courts,

25

that the statute cannot be read as requiring proof of an

improper motive.

Therefore,

make that decision and say very little more.
QUESTION:

this case is ripe for
This Court could

Mr. Mattingly, do you contend that

5

this statute,

6

incorporates some kind of substantive standard of medical

7

care?
MR. MATTINGLY:

8
9

this emergency medical care statute,

provides,

Justice O'Connor,

the statute

number one, a duty on the part of the hospital

10

to provide an appropriate medical screening examination,

11

and it does, by definition of some of the key terms,

12

to an obligation on the hospitals not to transfer patients

if that transfer would cause a substantial deterioration

in a patient's condition.

However,

So, arguably, yes,

if we think about what that standard is

-- hospital, you cannot transfer a patient if that

transfer is going to be the cause of material

deterioration in a substantial condition of that patient

than that.

You can't transfer if that transfer is going

Is that it?

MR. MATTINGLY:

2

That's correct, Your Honor.

3

However,

the -- the definition of -- of stabilized and to

stabilize indicate that, within reasonable medical

5

probability, no deterioration would occur to -- to a

6

condition that the patient had at the time of transfer.

QUESTION:

Now,

in -- in -- in this situation,

8

if Ms. Johnson had been stabilized at the time she was

9

initially admitted to the emergency room,

10

could she then

have been transferred?

11

MR. MATTINGLY:

12

QUESTION:

Your Honor, again,

I mean,

if -- if --

is -- doesn't this statute

really focus on what happens in the emergency room and the

14

stabilization there?

admitted to general admission in the hospital or sent

16

elsewhere?

Could she at that point have been

no.

Justice O'Connor,

Unfortunately, that's not an issue that --

QUESTION:

No.

MR. MATTINGLY:

-- that the parties have had an

21

opportunity to fully brief --

22

QUESTION:

I just wondered what your view of it

23

was because on the surface it would appear that this

24

statute just addresses itself to emergency room care.

MR. MATTINGLY:

I would disagree with that

1

analysis for a couple of reasons, Your Honor.
First of all,

2

there is -- there -- there are

3

several places in the statute that restrictions are

4

imposed upon hospitals and those restrictions are not

5

confined to emergency rooms.

6

the transfer provisions of the statute,

7

refer to transfer from a facility, which in my view is a

8

much broader term than simply transfer from an emergency

9

room.

For example,

if you review

those provisions

As a matter of fact, subsection (a)

of the statute

10

refers to the obligation to provide an emergency medical

11

- - excuse me - - an appropriate medical screening

12

examination in the emergency room or in other - -

13

QUESTION:

Well, presumably this argument would

14

be open in any event on remand if -- if we agree with you

15

that there's no improper motive requirement.

16

MR. MATTINGLY:

Honestly, Justice O'Connor,

it

17

would be our argument at the district court that that

18

entire argument was waived.

19

cross appeal filed in this case, and those issues were

20

never raised.

21

the trial court had already passed, and so it would be our

22

argument to the district court that any of those types of

23

arguments were waived by the hospital at the district

24

court level.

25

It was -- it -- there was no

2

MR. MATTINGLY:

3

No, Justice O'Connor.

Johnson resides in Bardstown.

substantial disabilities.

7

QUESTION:

She is disabled.

She lives

With respect to the response you just

8

gave that it would be your position that these points were

9

waived, but going in, there was a solid precedent of the

10

Sixth Circuit that the district court was obliged to

11

follow.

12

that precedent stood - -

So, why would there be any occasion as long as

QUESTION:

But

15

looking down the road, maybe the Supreme Court will

16

overturn the Sixth Circuit's precedent, and then do you

17

have an alternate argument?

18

- you have a - - quite an uphill argument to make for

19

waiver.

20

MR. MATTINGLY:

I think that you'd have to -

Justice Ginsburg, I think that

21

you are correct, that there is Sixth Circuit precedent

22

that would support an argument that - - that the

23

obligations of this statute apply outside of an emergency

24

room, and that I believe is the reason that the hospital

25

didn't raise this issue from the very beginning of the

case because it was pretty clear that - - that the

2

precedent in our circuit is that it's not limited to -- to

3

emergency room treatment.
The Thorton case is a case that's not cited by

the respondent hospital, but clearly says in that case --

that involved a patient who was transferred from an

But she was there for some weeks.

does this obligation end?

In her

Again, Justice Ginsburg, that is

-- that is an issue that unfortunately didn't get fully

three separate and distinct obligations on hospitals, not

patient arrives in the hospital and leaves the emergency

But my opinion would be that there is a very

If you look at section (a), there is a clear

QUESTION:

25

MR. MATTINGLY:

Section what?
Section (a) of the statute.

1

QUESTION:

8?

2

MR. MATTINGLY:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. MATTINGLY:

(a) .

(.a)?
Yes.

The first section of the

5

statute provides a duty on hospitals that have emergency

6

rooms or that provide emergency services to undertake to

7

provide this appropriate medical screening examination

8

when an individual, any individual, comes to the emergency

9

room.

10

If you then look at section (b) of that same

11

statute where obligations are -- are imposed on hospitals,

12

if they determine that such a condition exists, it does

13

not refer anyplace in section (b) to the patient having

14

come to the emergency room.

15

Then you look at section (c) and the

16

introductory sentence of section (c) is also different.

17

And that section, the section that specifically prohibits

18

transfers where a patient is not stabilized, refers to a

19

patient at a hospital.

20

comes to a hospital and the hospital has determined that

21

this condition exists.

22

hospital and you have an emergency medical condition, as

23

defined in the statute, and that condition has not been

24

stabilized, then you can't transfer that patient.

25

QUESTION:

It doesn't say that when a patient

It simply says if you are at a

1

hospitals that don't have emergency departments.

2

Because it begins in the case of a hospital that has a

3

hospital emergency department.

So, it envisions hospitals

4

without emergency departments.

And if (b) only applies to

5

emergency departments, hospitals without emergency

6

departments, they're simply off the hook entirely.

I thought that that would strengthen

your case.

MR. MATTINGLY:

QUESTION:

16

MR. MATTINGLY:

I would welcome your help.

But you're free to disagree.
I believe that section (a), the

requirement that -- that a hospital conduct an appropriate

medical screening examination, would apply to any hospital

19

that holds itself out as providing emergency services

MR. MATTINGLY:

I'm not familiar with a hospital

in Kentucky who does not.

QUESTION:

I'd hate to think there is one.

(Laughter.)

5

QUESTION:

In which case,

(a) doesn't make any

6

sense when it says in the case of a hospital that has a

7

hospital emergency department.

8

envisions hospitals that don't have emergency departments,

9

whatever that is.

I mean, it obviously

And you say that that means just

10

treating emergency conditions.

11

a hospital that doesn't treat emergency conditions.

MR. MATTINGLY:

QUESTION:

MR. MATTINGLY:

QUESTION:

So, you think it envisions

Yes.
No.

Okay.

MR. MATTINGLY:

QUESTION:

MR. MATTINGLY:

Correct.

Okay.
Section (b), it would appear to

20

me, is a much broader scope.

21

that have emergency services.

22

also include hospitals that perhaps don't provide

23

emergency services, if there are such hospitals.

QUESTION:

1

And without that, all you had to do

2

to - - to evade the apparent intention of the statute is

3

simply not to open an emergency department.
MR. MATTINGLY:

4

Absolutely, Your Honor, and

5

that's why section

6

broader section of the statute than section (a) because if

7

there are hospitals that don't provide emergency services

8

or close their emergency departments,

9

provides some obligation on that hospital.

(b)

in my view is a broader -- a

If, within the

10

capacity or the capabilities of that hospital,

11

recognize the existence of this emergency medical

12

condition,

14

to do so.

To the

they are obligated

Their further obligation is to try to arrange a

15
16

transfer of that patient to a hospital that possibly can

17

provide more care or better care for that particular

18

condition.

19

Section (c)

simply states that if a patient is

at a hospital, and in section (c)

21

no obligation that you can read from that section (c),

So, it would be our view that - - that there is a

2

very viable reading of the statute that would impose three

3

separate and distinct duties under sections (a),

4

(c) of that statute.
QUESTION:

5
6

(b), and

The State causes of action were --

were dismissed?

7

MR. MATTINGLY:

Not all of the State causes of

8

action.

In this case the Sixth Circuit and the district

9

court determined that the surgical resident, the medical

10

- - medical school student who signed the discharge of

11

Wanda Johnson, was not the agent of the hospital.

12

Therefore, under Kentucky law where the hospital would

13

normally be held liable vicariously, the hospital could

14

not be held liable for that medical student's negligence.

15

EMTALA, on the other hand, imposes direct

16

liability on hospitals and would provide a cause of action

17

against the hospital whether the - - the medical student

18

who signed the discharge was the hospital's agent or not.

19
20
21

22

QUESTION:

So - - so, the Federal law has a

respondeat superior theory that the State law does not?
MR. MATTINGLY:

It would appear that the statute

imposes direct liability.

23

Now, Kentucky does recognize --

Anyone's acts who have a

1

substantial impact on the decisions that the hospital is

2

required to make under the statute.

3

because the statute does not impose these obligations on,

4

for example, physicians to impose liability on hospitals,

5

a private citizen does not have a cause of action under

6

the statute against a physician who makes - - who may

7

violate the statute.

8

only to the Department for Health and Human Services.

9

For example, if --

That -- that remedy is available

So, even though Kentucky does, in some

10

circumstances, recognize a hospital's liability

11

vicariously for the acts of -- of certain physicians, in

12

this particular case the Sixth Circuit determined that

13

these medical students were not the hospital's agents, and

14

therefore EMTALA would actually provide a broader remedy

15

than State law would against hospitals for that conduct.

16

The - - the statute would not - - would not create

17

a situation where every -- every possible medical

18

malpractice claim that occurs in a hospital setting turns

19

into a Federal EMTALA claim like the hospital claims in

20

this case that it does, and the reason for that is that

21

EMTALA is -- is not focused on the entire spectrum of

22

hospital care.

where it requires these hospitals to provide an

appropriate medical screening examination and then focuses

at the end of that hospital care toward the transfer of

Now, in the middle of that spectrum, there is

going to be very much medical care that's provided and

many medical procedures that may be provided.

regarding how far a hospital's obligation extends and how

QUESTION:

Does the Secretary currently have no

position on a case like this where the stabilization,

according to the plaintiff, takes weeks, even months to

occur?

8

MR. FELDMAN:

9

I would -- maybe it might help, though, because

10

you used the term stabilized, to point out that under the

11

statute, there really are two kind of polar ways of

12

looking at it.

13

stabilization, it's defined in terms of assuring that

14

there's no deterioration of the -- of the patient's

15

condition during the transfer.

16

term stabilization is not -- and the Secretary has said

17

this -- is not a medical term under the statute.

18

defined statutory term and it doesn't really make sense

19

necessarily to talk about somebody being stabilized

20

outside of the context of a particular transfer that's

21

contemplated.

22

probably petitioner's view, that duty operates at the end

23

of the hospital stay pretty much no matter how long it

24

was .

25

The -- there is no position.

One is if you look at the definition of

in order for the stabilization requirement to apply, the

2

hospital must determine that there's an emergency medical

condition.

4

statute would be that if the hospital at some point

5

determines that there's no longer an emergency medical

6

condition, that that would terminate the hospital's

obiigations.

8

9

And I think another possible reading of the

So, I think there's at least those two polar
ways of looking at the statute and there's probably some

10

in-between cases too, and the Secretary would like the

11

opportunity to institute a rulemaking and look at the

12

question thoroughly and develop a view on the statute.

13

So, for that reason, as well as the belated

14

nature of respondent's presentation of the issues and the

15

fact that there probably are some unresolved factual

16

disputes on which the - - these other two issues are

premised, the Government believes that the Court shouldn't

Secretary who's contemplating regulations and so forth.

2

Would you comment on whether you agree that those

regulations might be helpful in addressing the issues that

you have raised?

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I think on -- on the two

6

particular questions that we're talking about, we would

7

almost certainly be in what I would regard as a Chevron

8

One world where Congress has spoken quite specifically to

9

the particular problems, the two questions being, does

10

EMTALA end when a hospital admits the patient for -- for

11

treatment of -- of the emergency medical condition?

12

It seems to me quite clear that the definition

13

of stabilized at -- at the appendix to the petitioner's

14

brief at A8 which talks about significant deterioration

15

from or during the transfer clearly has in mind the

16

discussion of a transfer arising at the time of the entry

17

into the emergency medical setting and not just any

18

transfer that might take place down the road.

19

And so, I would argue that if the Secretary were

20

to enact a regulation that extends a generalized duty

21

along the lines that is obliquely referred to in the

22

Solicitor General's brief, that extends months later after

screening requirement in the case of a hospital that has

(b) says in general if any individual

hospital must do blah, blah, blah.

MR. PHILLIPS:

If you don't have an emergency room, then the

QUESTION:

The statute doesn't apply at all.

MR. PHILLIPS:

There's no -- yes.

Congress did not mean to require very small institutions

So - - and there are such
I know you asked that

So, you don't have that obligation.
But then the question is if you do have an

12

13

emergency room and an individual is presented to you, you

14

have, one, an immediate obligation to provide an

15

appropriate screening examination, and then two, if at the

16

end of the appropriate screening examination you conclude

17

that the individual has an emergency medical condition,

18

then one of three courses follow from that.

19

Either you admit the patient, and I would

20

submit, given the statutory scheme, we're done at that

21

point.

22

Or, two, you decide you're going to transfer the

designed simply to get the patient from facility A to

2

in the patient's condition during that -- just during that

period.

4

And that's all the statute is designed to get at.
Or three, if you cannot provide stabilizing care

5

for whatever reason and you still believe that the

6

transfer has to be done, then you have to go through the

7

sequence of events under subsection (c), and that's what I

8

think this statute is designed to get at.

called emergency -- the Emergency Treatment Act, and that

That's why it's

10

is precisely the limitation of why it ought to be

that's -- that's a clear question of law, Justice Stevens.

It's not a holding of the Sixth Circuit, but there is some

21

considered dicta in the Thorton case that petitioner's

23

MR. MATTINGLY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and I would like to point out just a few things.

16

First of all, the interpretation of the statute

17

that is proposed by the hospital is focused strictly at -

18

- at patient dumping from the front end of the hospital,

19

basically the stories where hospitals turn patients away.

20

Its interpretation totally ignores situations that are

21

equally reprehensible, and that is the dumping of patients

22

at the other end of the spectrum, patients that are

23

hospitalized and for whatever reason the hospital makes a

24

decision that this patient is going to be transferred.

It may well have been

That may --

-- that sort of thing.

That's the

indication anyway.

7

MR. MATTINGLY:

Yes, that -- that may be true,

8

Justice O'Connor, that that was the primary focus of

9

Congress.
Wanda Johnson's situation is -- is a perfect

10

11

example of why Federal law was needed in this

12

circumstance.

13

Circuit decided that under State law Wanda Johnson had no

14

cause of action against the hospital because this medical

15

student who made this decision, even if that decision was

16

negligent and the subject of -- of State malpractice law,

17

did not create a cause of action against the hospital.

18

So, if in fact Wanda Johnson was dumped from the transfer

19

end, without this statute Wanda Johnson has no cause of

20

action against the hospital, only against a medical

21

student who made a decision to invoke a transfer of this

14

On the other hand, Dr. John Stuy, who was Wanda
