ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN J. KEATING

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KEATING:

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case presents an issue of fundamental

12

3

importance to the administration of criminal justice in

4

our Nation, whether judicial expansion of an unambiguous

5

statute based ostensibly on legislative purpose should be

6

permitted.
The Second Circuit's holding that the Federal

7
8

carjacking statute encompasses the unstated and expansive

9

mens rea element of conditional intent must be reversed,

20

as it contravenes the plain and unequivocal language of

21

the statute and thus violates this Court's longstanding

22

canons of statutory construction.

23

the issue.

24
25

This alone forecloses

Moreover, if legislative history is relevant,
and we think it is not, the legislative history does not

1

support a finding of conditional intent in the statute.

2

In fact, a clear reading of the legislative history

3

reveals that Congress could not have intended this statute

4

to be a conditional intent statute.

5

Finally, the Government's assertion that the

6

concept of conditional intent can simply be read into the

7

specific intent element, as there is a traditional

8

recognition of the concept in our country in statutes

9

analogous to the carjacking statute is a complete fiction.
QUESTION:

10

I have a little trouble with

11

understanding the concept of intent and conditional

12

intent.

13

called conditional intent, but intent is very broad, and

14

is it possible that someone who stops a motorist with a

15

gun, saying, give me your keys, and pointing the gun at

16

him, could be said -- could the fact-finder find intent to

17

cause death or serious bodily injury from that --

I don't find many cases dealing with the so-

And if not, why not?
The answer is no, Your Honor, and

that's precisely why the district court improperly

instructed the jury on conditional intent, because the

25

district court realized that that would not satisfy the

intent element.

2

Intent is generally defined --

3

QUESTION:

Well, why?

That's up to the jury,

4

and they can determine it from circumstantial evidence.

5

And if the circumstances are the use of a deadly weapon

6

and the demand for the keys and the vehicle and the use of

7

the weapon in hand,

8

intent to cause serious injury.

I would think the jury could find

I think there's -- I think Justice

O'Connor's question is,

of evidence she referred to,

21

they couldn't.

could they infer a

They might well choose not to.

22

It seems to me what the case here turns on is

23

what is the meaning of the statutory intent, not what a

24

jury could find from a proper charge.

MR. KEATING:

Your Honor, could they infer a

1

conditional intent?

They could, clearly, from the facts

2

presented to the jury.

That inference could be drawn.

Our argument here is not that the concept of

3
4

conditional intent is an unconstitutional one.

5

argument is relatively straightforward.

6

This statute doesn't express the concept.

7

history never mentions the concept, and there is -QUESTION:

The legislative

It seems to me that your answer to

Justice O'Connor should have been that the Government must

10

have proof of a fixed intent to injure, no matter, and

11

that given her hypothetical there was just not enough.

12

And if that's the answer -- I think that has to be your

13

answer.

14

Maybe, maybe not.
If that's your answer, it seems to me that the

15

rejoinder is, well, this is very difficult to do.

16

makes it a statute which is difficult to prosecute,

17

difficult to implement, and we shouldn't attribute to

18

Congress the objective of having a statute which is really

19

difficult to obtain convictions under.

20

MR. KEATING:

This

Well, Your Honor, the statute

21

perhaps is difficult to prosecute if conditional intent is

22

read into it, if I'm understanding the Court's question.

23

If conditional intent is not somehow magically

24

read into the specific intent element, then the statute is

25

not difficult to prosecute.

It's not unlike any other

carjackings that occur all the time without the resulting

MR. KEATING:

I'm going to get the car.

MR. KEATING:

QUESTION:

those cases, in your view.

QUESTION:

Well, the -- I -- Your Honor --

I mean, that's kind of a -- I think

Congress might be surprised with your view of what it had

done.

MR. KEATING:

Your Honor, I allow for the

possibility that this statute doesn't have the reach that

Congress intended.

17

allow for the possibility that possibly Congress didn't

think it all the way through when they enacted the

QUESTION:

I allow for that possibility, and I

Isn't it, Mr. Keating, more than

that, because before the amendment, when the statute just

said, in possession of a gun, this conduct would have been

covered, right?

1

Congress was responding to carjackings that involved

2

weapons other than guns and wanted to take out the gun

3

part in order to broaden, not narrow the reach of the

4

statute.

Is that not so?
MR. KEATING:

5

That is so, Your Honor, but at the

6

same time cries were voiced by a number of Members of

7

Congress that by doing that they would be further diluting

8

the already-attenuated Federal nexus of the carjacking

9

statute.

10

If you simply strike the word firearm virtually

11

every carjacking committed in our country, some 35,000 at

12

the time of this offense, would be a State crime.

13

concern was raised regarding the principles of Federalism,

14

and this is important --

15

QUESTION:

So you think --

16

QUESTION:

Yes, but --

17

QUESTION:

-- we should give it your

And the

18

interpretation in the interests of Federalism and leave

19

these things to the States, because under your reading of

20

it very few are going to end up in Federal prosecutions.

21
22

23

MR. KEATING:

Your Honor, I don't think that

very few would end up in Federal prosecutions.
If a carjacker approaches an individual on the

24

street, points a gun at them, and fires at him and misses,

25

that's a Federal prosecution.

QUESTION:

1

Well, yes, but that's not the way you

2

engage in carjacking.

Anyone who did that would not only

3

be a carjacker but insane.

4

point a gun at somebody not because you want to cause him

5

death or a serious bodily injury but because you want the

car, and your interpretation would reduce the ambit of

this statute to screwballs, not carjackers.

QUESTION:

MR. KEATING:

If you want to carjack, you

Well --

Wouldn't it?
No, I don't believe so, Your

Honor.

And if you look at what Congress did when they

May I just interrupt with one brief

question?

MR. KEATING:

QUESTION:

Is it not fairly clear that they took

the word firearm out because they wanted to include

additional weapons?

MR. KEATING:

1

2

Yes.

That's precisely what they

wanted to do.
Those versions of the amended statute go into

3
4

committee.

5

committee.

There's no record of what transpired in

Out of committee comes the statute with the

6

7

specific intent element.

If the Government's

8

interpretation is adopted that the specific intent element

9

must be read as including a conditional intent, there

10

would have been no purpose whatsoever in adding the

11

specific intent clause, because the statute already said,

12

whoever takes a motor vehicle from another by force,

13

violence, or intimidation.

14

It's difficult to imagine a case where that

15

statute, left standing alone, where the Government would

16

not also be able to establish that the perpetrator

17

harbored a conditional intent to harm, so why add the

18

language?

19

QUESTION:

Wasn't part of it so as to make

20

someone who would violate this eligible for the death

21

penalty?

22

MR. KEATING:

The death penalty provision was

23

added to the statute, but if the Court is asking, is that

24

why the intent language was put into the statute --

25

QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. KEATING:

Honor, for this reason.

to constitutionalize the death penalty, that one intends

QUESTION:

As the Court is aware in its

anyway, which wouldn't suffice to comply with our

9

constitutional requirements.

10
11

MR. KEATING:

That also would not be necessary

under the Tison decision.

12

QUESTION:

But look --

3

QUESTION:

We're talking about what Congress

4
5

thought, not what the law was.
MR. KEATING:

Well, we would presume that

6

Congress -- and I'll add to it, Your Honor, that there's

7

another section of the amended statute which deals with

8

the constitutionality of the death penalty provisions.

QUESTION:

Mr. Keating, your case ultimately

20

hangs, it seems to me, on the text.

21

meant, whatever they intended, you come up here and you

22

say, this is what they wrote.

23

guts of your case is whether, indeed, that language, with

24

intent to cause death or serious bodily harm, is

25

susceptible of a conditional interpretation.

Whatever Congress

And it seems to me that the

And that, in

1

turn, depends upon whether there is this lengthy history

2

of interpreting provisions that way.
You started to say that there was no such

3
4

history.

I'd like to hear you say more about it.

5

MR. KEATING:

6

QUESTION:

7

The Government says that there -- you

know, this is -- we do this all the time.
MR. KEATING:

8

9

Your Honor --

That's right.

And I'll begin by

saying, Your Honor, that it only depends on this lengthy

10

history if, in fact, the statute is deemed to be

11

ambiguous.

12

the statute is not ambiguous, and Rubin instructs that if

13

the language of a statute is unambiguous, the first canon

14

of statutory construction, that being that you look at the

15

text --

16

And we argue that the statute, the language of

QUESTION:

Well, it's ambiguous if language like

17

this has, for hundreds of years, been interpreted to be

18

satisfied by conditional intent, okay.

19

MR. KEATING:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. KEATING:

In --

Can we get to that?
In support of their assertion that

22

there is a longstanding recognition of conditional intent,

23

the Government cites to not a single Federal statute which

24

expresses the concept.

25

of this Court which embraces the concept.

They cite to not a single decision

They cite to a

1

handful of State
QUESTION:

2

3

They cited two

things.
MR. KEATING:

4

A handful of State court

5

precedents which seem to embrace the concept in varying

6

contexts.

7

Attempts is a different animal altogether than a completed

8

crime in the context of a conditional intent.

Some of these citations were to attempts.

9

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not too sure I've seen many

10

statutes in which the conditional intent is expressly

11

eliminated in favor of a fixed intent.

12

say in this statute whoever hijacks a car and intends in

13

all events to cause injury or death, in order to

14

incorporate your view.

15

like that.

16

I suppose you'd

I've just never seen a statute

I'm not sure which way that cuts.

17

if that helps you or hurts you.

18

MR. KEATING:

I don't know

Well, I suppose it cuts both ways,

19

but it would have been very simple, Your Honor, to do

20

this.

21

if necessary.

With intent to cause death or serious physical harm

QUESTION:

22

23

That's --

Well, have you ever seen a statute

like that?

24

If necessary.

MR. KEATING:

No, and Your Honor, that proves

the point.

If conditional intent can simply be read into

1

2

the specific intent element, we would expect to see pages

3

upon pages of citations from the Government expressing

4

that concept.

5

QUESTION:

Why?

6

QUESTION:

I think maybe the opposite, because

7

if this had been a problem, it would have come up in

8

hundreds of criminal statutes, and it's never been a

9

problem.
MR. KEATING:

10
11

Because it's never been applied,

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

12

Well, you say never, but I mean, I

3

had my law clerk look up all those cites in the

4

Government's brief, and she came back that not only do you

5

have Lafave, you have such conservative things, AmJur, you

6

have about

7

couldn't be more explicit.

8
9

5 State cases, and the Model Penal Code

I mean, you know, when a particular purpose is
an element of an offense, the element is established,

20

although such purpose is conditional, unless the condition

21

negatives the harm or evil.

22

I mean, so Cong -- I agree with you this is a

23

total error that they put this language in this place.

24

think they did want to -- they wanted to amend section 3

25

on the death penalty.

I

1

But nonetheless we have the statute in front of

2

us, and there is this history, so what -- I mean, if I've

3

looked up these sources, which my law clerk did, Lafave,

4

other treatises, the Model Penal Code,

5

which, or more, which read it that way is -- you've done a

6

heroic job, but is there something to say about that?

7

MR. KEATING:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. KEATING:

0 cases, all of

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.
The Government cites

0 cases,

10

State cases that stand for the proposition;

11

out of 50, hardly a traditional recognition of the

12

concept.

3

0

0, of course,

With regard to the Model Penal Code, Your Honor,

4

while the Model Penal Code embraces the concept of

5

conditional intent, it then greatly limits its

6

application, and the Government provides half a definition

7

of the code's concept of conditional intent in the brief.

8
9

Conditional intent will always depend on the
attendant circumstances.

I will take your car unless you

20

give -- or, I will shoot you unless you give me the keys.

21

The giving of the keys are the attendant circumstances.

22

The code states that where attendant

23

circumstances is an element, the element can be satisfied

24

if the actor is aware of the attendant circumstances or

25

hopes or believes in its existence.

As awareness of the

1

attendant circumstance can never be guaranteed, the code

2

allows for conviction if the actor is aware of a high

3

probability.

4

Therefore, under the Model Penal Code they allow

5

for the recognition of conditional intent, but only if the

6

actor is aware of a high probability of the condition

7

occurring, or is aware or hopes in its existence.

8

that interpretation of the code has been adopted by at

9

least one circuit, the First Circuit, in recognizing

10

conditional intent.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. KEATING:

And

How would that apply here?
It would apply here, Your Honor,

3

at a minimum to the fact that the district court

4

Your Honor, the principle is

that even if we're totally convinced that Congress meant

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA D. UNDERWOOD

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. UNDERWOOD:

14

The carjacking statute makes it

15

a Federal crime to take a car from a person by force or

16

intimidation with intent to cause death or serious bodily

17

harm.

18

Petitioner suggests that the statute only

19

punishes carjackers who intend to cause death or serious

20

bodily harm whether or not their victims resist, but that

21

interpretation makes no sense.

22

The way this phrase came into the statute, the

23

traditional meaning of the phrase used in this way in

24

penal codes and at common law, and the structure of the

25

statute, all show that Congress could not have used the

word intent with that limited meaning.
I'd like to talk about the way the phrase came

2

into the statute.
In

4

992, Congress made it a crime to take a car

5

by force and violence or intimidation from a person while

6

possessing a firearm.
In

7

994, Congress took out the firearm and

8

substituted the requirement of intent to cause death or

9

serious bodily harm.

When they took out the firearm

10

requirement, as several justices have noticed, they

11

thought they were broadening the statute, not narrowing

12

it.
The supporters of the amendment wanted to reach

3
4

the carjacker who drags the victim along behind the car,

5

or who uses a knife or a pipe or some other instrument

6

rather than a gun.

7

The original proposal was to take out the

8

firearm requirement without putting anything new in, but

9

Congress eventually decided to replace one limitation with

20

another.

22

continue to be those that present a serious risk of death

23

or serious bodily harm.

committing a robbery with an unloaded gun or a water

2

pistol or a toy gun, or a finger in a pocket purporting to

3

be a gun, a frightening experience but not one that risks

4

killing someone the way committing a robbery with a

5

weapon, under the old statute, or with intent to kill,

6

under the new statute does.

7

Both of those, those are alternative ways of

8

restricting Federal carjacking to the most dangerous sorts

9

of carjacking.
QUESTION:

10

Is there anything that would not be

11

covered by your interpretation of the statute, short of

12

the water pistol or the index finger in the pocket?

That is, this defendant argued to the jury when

2

he lost on the construction of the statute that

4

nevertheless I never intended that this gun be fired.

He didn't testify to this effect.

6

I

It was his

7

lawyer's argument that the Government had not proved that

8

he had any intent that his threat would materialize, and

9

that was a fair -- that argument was allowed to go to the

10

jury, and if they had failed to find intent actually to

11

deliver on the threat, he should have been acquitted.

12

That's what the jury was charged.

13

There was additional evidence beyond the loaded

14

gun in this case.

15

accomplice had discussed the use of the gun, and there was

16

the evidence that he had actually used physical force, not

17

deadly force, that he had punched one of the victims, so

18

it was a case in which the claim that he didn't actually

19

intend to deliver on the threat was less likely to be well

20

received.

QUESTION:

There was the evidence that he and his

language was put in to remove from the statute any

QUESTION:

3
4

And doesn't that require the actual

assault intending to hurt the person?
MS. UNDERWOOD:

5

No.

What that requires, it's

6

just those cases -- many of the cases that we've cited for

7

this conditional intent proposition are cases of assault

8

with intent to injure or do serious bodily harm.

9

there's a Federal case involving some because the Federal

provision.

somebody escapes from a military stockade, points a gun at

the guards and says, wait in the latrine or I'll shoot.

6

And he then escapes, doesn't shoot, and he is convicted,

and the conviction is sustained over just such an attack,

8

on the grounds that his intent was to injure if the threat

wasn't enough, and that that satisfies the requirement of

Congress' purpose here, and it did.
I think the structure of the statute makes that

3
4

plain.

The statute provides for taking a car either by

force or by intimidation.

kill somebody by intimidation alone, so it's hard to see

how someone with unconditional intent to injure or kill

could commit a carjacking by intimidation.

effectuate his objectives, that's sufficient.

5

That's what we've been describing, is

6

conditional intent, but you could as well simply describe

7

it as embraced within the concept of intent, and that's

8

how this conviction was obtained.

9

I want to say something about the -- another

10

piece of evidence about what Congress was thinking about,

11

since that question was asked, is that originally Senator

12

Lieberman introduced in May of '93 a provision that

3

clearly was designed to do two separate things -- this was

4

before the omnibus crime bill -- to add the death penalty

5

to fatal carjackings, and to remove the weapons

16

requirement from all carjackings, and there isn't the

7

little problem about which section number is being

8

modified in that proposal.

9

A few months later, when the omnibus crime bill

20

was in the Congress, in the Senate, and there was a long

21

list of crimes to which the death penalty was to be added,

22

he added to the provision that said, add the death penalty

23

to carjackings, his old proposal to also remove the

24

weapons requirement.

25

adopted by the Senate and ultimately went to a compromise.

And it was that amendment that was

I am describing where it

8

came from, and to the extent we're looking for an

9

indication about what it was doing, what is clear --

10

forget intent about all this background -- is that the

11

intent requirement comes in as a substitute for the

12

weapons requirement.

And that, I think, without reading

3

anybody's mind, shows that it was designed to do what the

4

weapons requirement had previously done, and not to fix --

5

to adapt this statute for death penalty purposes, which

16

was a separate project.
