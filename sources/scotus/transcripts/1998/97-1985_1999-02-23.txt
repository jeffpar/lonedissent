ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAVIER H. RUBINSTEIN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case presents two entirely distinct

11

questions:

13

harmless error review even if the element was not in

14

dispute at trial; and, second, whether materiality is an

15

element of the Federal mail, wire and bank fraud statutes.

whether the failure of the trial court to

The first question is the one that we

reserved in our Johnson opinion, is it not?
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

It is, Your Honor.

Although

19

Johnson did not squarely present the question, in any

20

event, since there had been no contemporaneous objection

21

to the error.

And, as a result --

Justice Scalia,

I assume you're

9

phrasing of the question presented was taken from the

The

10

government's phraseology of the question.

11

having pled not guilty to the crime and having

12

specifically requested an instruction on materiality, that

13

no court could constitutionally declare that the element

was truly uncontested.

QUESTION:

We agree that

Not in dispute.

But you acknowledge

that you didn't bring in any -- any evidence or

QUESTION:

Indeed, if it goes back for some

2

reason, if we agree with you and it's retried, you don't

3

really think the government's going to have any trouble

4

proving materiality, I assume?

5

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

I don't -- I don't believe

6

that, on a retrial, that materiality would be a central

7

focus of any defense to the tax fraud charge.

8

agree with that, Justice O'Connor.

9

I would

Nonetheless, it is undisputed in this case that

10

the trial court completely removed the element of

11

materiality on the tax fraud charge, both by directing a

12

verdict on that element in favor of the prosecution and by

13

then instructing the jury that materiality was not for the

14

jury to decide.

How did he direct the verdict on that issue?

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

The judge explicitly stated on

20

the record that the question of materiality was for the

21

court to decide, not for the jury to decide.

22

QUESTION:

So, he didn't tell the jury to make a

23

finding of materiality --

do that?
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

2

What he told the --he did not

3

tell the jury that the court had found materiality.

4

the judge instructed the jury several times was that the

5

jury was not to be concerned with the question of

6

materiality because the materiality was not for the jury

7

to decide.
QUESTION:

8

9

And what was what he told them even

on the tax count?

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

QUESTION:

12

15

That's correct.

Where materiality is mentioned in the

statute.

13
14

What

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

That's correct, Justice

O' Connor.
We believe that the 11th Circuit's harmless

16

error holding must be reversed for at least three reasons.

17

First, the trial court's constitutional error is not

18

subject to harmless error scrutiny, in light of the fact

19

that element -- that the element of materiality was

20

completely removed from the jury's consideration.

21

QUESTION:

Well, what if the district court,

22

instead of omitting to charge the jury at all on

23

materiality, had given it an erroneous charge on

24

materiality would that, too, be not subject to harmless

25

error review?

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

1

That would depend upon whether

2

or not the misinstruction on the element was sufficiently

3

serious that the jury did not in fact find the actual

4

element beyond a reasonable doubt.
QUESTION:

So, then, we really -- no -- no -- no

know in advance without -- it's a case-by-case analysis in

8

your view?
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

9

We agree with that.

And we

believe that it does not -- is not necessary for an

11

appellate court to label the error either as an omission

12

or a misinstruction.

was addressed.

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

this.

In Sullivan, this Court articulated this concept of

2

functional equivalence.

3

elaborated by Justice Scalia, in his concurring opinion in

4

Roy.

And it was, again, further

And the test is this:

5

Functional equivalence occurs where the jury

6

actually finds the element in question, either by its

7

consideration of other elements on other counts or because

8

the jury could not have found what it did find without

9

actually finding the element that was removed.
It is not enough to say that the jury found

10
11

three things and that surely the jury would have found the

12

fourth element.

13

Sullivan, said that cannot be done.

14

That is precisely what this Court, in

QUESTION:

Well, so then, then, there will be

15

very little subject to harmless error review even if it's

16

an erroneous instruction rather than, under your view,

17

even rather than an omission?

18

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

We don't believe that it would

19

have that type of broad effect for two reasons.

20

Pope was actually a case in which functional equivalence

21

was found.

22

think, more importantly, this Court's decision in Johnson

23

will serve to have a very substantial limiting effect.

24
25

That may occur from time to time.

QUESTION:

1

plain error and there was a failure to instruct, and we

2

applied harmless error analysis.

3

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

In Johnson, there was no

4

contemporaneous objection to the instructional error.

5

defendant had argued that that failure to object should

6

essentially have been disregarded.

7

constitutional rights can be forfeit, and that by failing

8

to object on a timely basis to the instruction, that the

9

defendant had in fact forfeited the right to have the jury

This Court said that

10

instruct to be -- have the jury instructed on that

11

element.
QUESTION:

12

So, had there been no objection here,

13

we would be in a Johnson situation?

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

The

That's exactly correct, Justice

O' Connor.
QUESTION:

Well, why -- if that is so, why

17

couldn't we say just what the court said in Sullivan, that

18

there's really nothing for us to operate on, we can't

19

speculate on what the jury would have found?

20

what's the difference in those two instances?

21

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

What --

Well, in -- in the -- I think

22

the key point -- I want to make sure I understand your

23

question, Justice Kennedy --we believe that what you just

24

said in terms of Sullivan is exactly correct, and that in

25

this case there is nothing that the harmless error

1

scrutiny can operate on, since there was no complete

2

verdict on every element of the crime.

3

The reason that that principle was not applied

4

in Johnson is because the constitutional right that

5

underlied this Court's decision in Sullivan, which is the

6

constitutional right to have the jury render a verdict of

7

guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on every element --

8

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubinstein, I don't understand

that there isn't this functional equivalent.

Let's --

10

let's say we accept your theory that you can't leave

11

something out and have the jury never find it and say,

12

well, they would have found it anyway.

13

which was not explored by the court of appeals as far as I

14

know, of the possibility that this does meet the

15

functional equivalence test, that's still open isn't it?

But the notion,

16

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

17

Ginsburg, for a couple of reasons.

18

believe that it's possible in this case to find that the

19

jury actually did find materiality, given the judge's

20

explicit instruction to the jury several times that

21

materiality was not a matter for the jury to decide.

22

this Court, over and again, has reinforced the proposition

23

that juries are presumed to follow the instructions that

24

they are given by the court.

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Because what Sullivan said is that when there is

The reason that removal --

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

11

The reason that removal of an

12

element from the jury's consideration must be regarded as

13

one of the small class of structural errors is because the

14

error in that case is that the wrong entity has served as

15

the finder of fact on the element that was removed.

16

a structural error because it -- the right that we are

17

talking about is the preservation of the line that has

18

always separated the constitutional role of the judge and

19

the jury.

QUESTION:

It is

The reason,

1

this Court also explained in Sullivan itself, the reason

2

that the error in Pope was found to have been subject to

could have found what it did find without actually finding

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

QUESTION:

Well, in other words, you're saying

4

no rational juror could find that the amount of money that

was withheld from -- left out of the income tax return

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Not in this case.

QUESTION:

No, but I'm saying your view is that

even if we conclude that no rational juror could have

nevertheless, say that -- just the exact opposite of what

the last sentence of the Pope opinion says?

QUESTION:

We believe that that is the

Are you drawing -- if I understand

this line -- you're saying that if the jury makes a

finding -- call it A -- finding A necessarily implies a

2

finding B, which it did not make and was not instructed to

22

make; that in that case, there may be harmless error,

It's the difference between saying

that a finding of X includes a finding of Y and saying

that any jury that found X would surely, if it was a

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

to me, of saying it is that the -- that the jury, in

necessarily assuming a proportion which we know as -- or

I disagree, Justice Scalia.

And save us a lot of money in -- in

the whole jury process.
MR. MCLEESE:

9

I disagree.

Equally, we do not

allow judges to exclude constitutionally admissible

11

evidence.

12

appellate courts have the authority, under this Court's

13

cases, including Van Arsdale, to say, although the jury

14

that decided this case never considered that evidence, we

15

can make the judgment with sufficient confidence that any

16

rational jury that heard that evidence would have reached

17

the same verdict on the constitutional record that should

have been in front of it as the judgment that it reached

on the record that was curtailed by omission that it had

in front of it.

And when judges do that, we find error.

the error would be harmless under the rule that we

propose.

QUESTION:

Then calling it a material -- then

calling materiality a jury issue really has nothing behind

I'm not quite sure.

2

MR. MCLEESE:

Well, there were two lines of

reasoning in Sullivan.

is entirely consistent with our submission.

5

that reasonable doubt instructions are part of the

6

fundamental structure of the entire trial.

7

constitutional defects in that structure require reversal

without more, because the defendant has not received the

kind of a trial that we will insist upon, whatever else

happened at the trial.

And that is

That line of reasoning is entirely

There is a line of reasoning in Sullivan which

suggests, as Petitioner argues here, that harmless error

Sullivan was not so much that the elaboration of the

I think the concern was that it was

down the concept of reasonable doubt.

MR. MCLEESE:

So, I do think that instructions

they may convict on less than reasonable doubt on all of

and more pervasive in a way that justifies treating them

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAVIER H. RUBINSTEIN

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

3

The government incorrectly

4

suggests that the test we are advocating for whether or

5

not an error is subject to harmless error review is

6

somehow a new test or that it would present new practical

7

problems.

8

is precisely the same test that it articulated in Sullivan

9

and in Yates:

10
11

The test that we are urging the Court to follow

Was -- did the jury actually find every

element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt?
That is the question the Court has to answer.

12

If the jury did not, then the error is not subject to

13

harmless error review.

14

The government also places heavy reliance on the

15

evidence concerning materiality.

16

pointed out, when the jury is told to ignore an element,

17

the evidence pertaining to that element vanishes.

The

18

jury has nothing to assess that evidence through.

That is

19

what the jury's instructions are for.

20

But as this Court has

Ultimately, we believe, as the government

21

correctly concedes, not every jury would be required to

22

find that a failure to report income is material.

23

exactly our point.

24

the circumstances of each particular case, whether or not

25

materiality was established.

That's

It is for the jury to decide, under

the element of materiality is taken away from the jury, no

2

appellate court can declare that harmless for the same

3

reason that a court cannot direct a verdict of guilt.

QUESTION:

Mr. Rubinstein, what do you say

about -- about Mr. McLeese's gold mine hypothetical?
MR. RUBINSTEIN:

6

The gold mine hypothetical

7

would obviously have involved a material

8

misrepresentation.

9

If someone --

QUESTION:

Never mind the materiality, I'm --

I'm talking about when in fact the gold mine is -- is a

11

gold mine, and -- and what he's mistaken about is -- is

12

not -- not the materiality but whether he's defrauding.

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Well, ultimately, if the --if

the defendant makes a statement he believes to be false

true --

The statute is not violated?
That's correct.

So, you're consistent.

But if we didn't merge completed

22

offenses, I suppose we could say the statute would be

23

violated.

prior to the discovery that there was all this gold there

1

MR. RUBINSTEIN:

Well, in our view, certainly.

2

But we agree with the government that the statute covers

3

not only the actual devising, but the intent to devise.

But it must include a material misrepresentation.
