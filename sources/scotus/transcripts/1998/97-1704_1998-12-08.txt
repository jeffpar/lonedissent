CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

The Fibreboard Corporation.
Mr. Tribe.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. TRIBE:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The Fifth Circuit does not deny that this class

12

is just as noncohesive and riven with conflict as the one

13

in Amchem, and it even admits, in its words, that a class

14

action -- I'm reading from footnote 8 of the opinion --

15

class action requesting individual damages for a global

16

class of asbestos claimants would not satisfy the

17

typicality requirements.

18

Now, since that is this case, the first mystery,

19

I think, to be addressed is how the Fifth Circuit and the

20

respondents imagine that they can get past Rule 23(a)

21

here.

22

I think a fair version of their answer is that

23

one should focus on how the settlements would operate and

24

not on what the complaints sought, and if you do that,

25

you're told you will see that the settlement in Amchem
3

1

would have ended up, in their words, awarding damages to

2

class members based on the severity of their injuries,

3

while this settlement, according to them, just sets up an

4

equitable distribution process that leaves intact each

5

claimants, and I now quote them again, absolute right to

6

exit into the tort system to litigate his claims in court.
Now, that answer is fallacious from top to

7
8

bottom.

Amchem held, among other things, that one cannot

9

rely entirely on the operation of the settlement to

10

dissolve divisions that preclude class certification, and

11

their description, both of the settlement in Amchem and of

12

the settlement in this case, are flatly wrong.

13

The Amchem settlement, as this Court noted, did

14

not preordain the amounts to be awarded to each claimant,

15

just as this settlement doesn't, and this settlement

16

certainly does not simply add a fund from which damages

17

can be paid to plaintiffs.

18
19
20

It does not preserve the absolute right to exit,
as I'll explain in just a moment.
It extinguishes individual rights to sue and

21

substitutes access to a trust distribution process rather

22

akin to Worker's Compensation.

23

The reason I say that it does not preserve a

24

right to exit is that first of all no exit is possible

25

till one has exhausted mediation, arbitration, and other

1

ADR mechanisms, and even then the plaintiff who does exit

2

remains subject to all of the settlement's strict limits,

3

$1/2 million as a cap on compensatory damages, no punitive

4

damages, no prejudgment interest, no post judgment

5

interest, no joint and several liability.
And finally, anyone who does exit is penalized

6

7

for exercising the right recognized I guess most recently

8

in Wright v. Universal Maritime Service Corporation, right

9

of going to court, penalized because payments can then be

10

deferred for up to 10 years without interest as compared

11

with 3 years if someone opts not to exit and remains

12

within the trust system.

13

QUESTION:

Now --

Mr. Tribe, I thought that the Fifth

14

Circuit on remand said the big difference was that Amchem

15

was certified under (b)(3), and this was a nonopt-out

16

(b) (1) (B) .

17

MR. TRIBE:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, they

18

certainly did, and what I would like to show in a moment

19

is that, if that's the difference, it cuts very much

20

against class certification here.

21

certification partly because, as I'll try to show, it's

22

impossible to squeeze this into that category of a

23

mandatory class, but in any event, that can't solve the

24

problems under (a), the problems of cohesion and of the

25

absence of conflict.

It cuts against class

And in particular, if you focus on the absence

1

2

of conflict, what's crucial to note is that the equitable

3

distribution process in this case embodies allocational

4

decisions, decisions to limit damage payments from the

5

trust.

6

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tribe, you talk about how

7

badly these people are going to fare under the - - but how

8

well are they going to fare if they just keep fighting

9

their individual lawsuits?

10

MR. TRIBE:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not

11

talking about how good or bad in terms of ultimate

12

fairness the settlement is, only the question of whether

13

it was proper to certify it in the first instance.

14

QUESTION:

Well, but you pointed out that the

15

people are left -- even when they finally go to court it's

16

a cap on damages and that sort of thing, but don't you

17

have to compare that with what their fate would be if they

18

simply keep suing Fiberboard and it ends up in bankruptcy?

19

MR. TRIBE:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, if we were

20

talking about whether it's a good settlement, if that's

21

the reason I was mentioning the caps, I guess we would.

22

I'm mentioning them only to make clear that as

23

in Amchem this is not simply a favor that they are doing

24

to the people who have been victimized by asbestos.

25

a substitution of their old rights with a set of equitable

(800) FOR DEPO

It is

1

rights, and it's a substitution that makes some

2

allocational decisions with respect to which there's a

3

deep division, a conflict.

4

Those who are presently injured have, as in

5

Amchem, an interest in maximizing payments early.

Those

6

who are merely exposed have an interest in preserving

7

money for the future, and there was no attempt to create

8

subclasses here.
If subclasses with separate representation had

9
10

been created, no one can really guess exactly how the

11

ultimate settlement would look.

12

suppose that it couldn't have been done, and no reason,

13

therefore, to suppose that the only alternative is an

14

endless stream of individual lawsuits.

15

percent of asbestos litigation settles in any event.

QUESTION:

There's no reason to

MR. TRIBE:

I couldn't tell from your brief whom you

They are objectors -And how many of them are there?
They are individual objectors who

23

were exposed to asbestos, and who do not want to be

24

members of this class, and who were allowed --

25

QUESTION:

They are all people who were exposed?

1

MR. TRIBE:

2

QUESTION:

3

Yes .
So they're not members of those who

are not exposed - MR. TRIBE:

4

That's correct.

They were exposed,

5

and they were allowed to intervene for purposes of

6

expressing objection both to the nonopt-out nature of the

7

class,

and to the certification as a unitary class.
QUESTION:

8
9

How many of them are there?

How many

intervened?

10

MR. TRIBE:

11

QUESTION:

I think there are five.
Five intervenors, and are they people

12

who question the jurisdiction,

13

MR. TRIBE:

Well,

also,

or are they --

three of them do.

The ones

14

that are not from Texas also under Shutts question

QUESTION:

Where are they from?

MR. TRIBE:

I believe Alabama --

18

all from Alabama.

19

The others are from Alabama.

20

I guess they're

I thought one had been from Missouri.

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, you indicated that

21

assuming there was adequate representation you thought

22

that a class action might well be possible here.
MR. TRIBE:

23

Well -- no.

I think ultimately,

24

because of the justiciability problems and the notice

25

problems,

it would have to be cut down to a manageable

1

size.
Those who are merely exposed,

2

some of whom don't

3

even exist yet, who haven't been born, who are future

4

spouses of people exposed, we think couldn't possibly be

5

included in a class, but at least it's not inconceivable

6

that a somewhat more modest effort could work, as long as

7

there were subclasses so that subgroups with distinct

8

interests were separately represented.
QUESTION:

9

Under

(b)(1)(B),

then I'm confused,

10

because I thought it was your position, no matter how fair

11

the settlement, no matter how good it is for the greatest

12

number,

13

action which consolidates or,

14

many injured and potentially injured people.

(b)(1)(B)

in your words,

collectivizes

I thought your position was that's not the

15
16

office of

(b) (1) (B) .
MR. TRIBE:

17

That's right.

Justice Ginsburg, we

18

think that if this could have been certified at all,

19

would have been under

20

more modest scope.

21

22

(b)(1)(B)

it

(b)(3) with subclasses and with a

Maybe I should turn to why I think

is of really no help.
QUESTION:

I want to ask you on the first

23

question, you're basically saying that the lawyers

24

shouldn't have represented their own existing clients and

25

also the class of futures.

MR. TRIBE:

1

That's separate, Justice Breyer.

2

There are two huge conflicts.

3

they represented their own 45,000, but they opted out en

4

masse from this nonopt-out class.

5

One is, as you say, that

The other is that within the class itself, the

6

gerrymandered class, within that class they should not

7

simultaneously have represented the presently injured and

8

the merely exposed, and also the pre and post - -

QUESTION:

So in respect to both, I take it

These lawyers are very experienced.

job, and I look at both sides of this and I make a balance

this.

wrong.

It's not that we're asking you to review some

2

factual determination about how capable and ethical these

3

lawyers are, but with respect to the idea that because

4

there was so little time between August 9, 1993 and August

5

27, 18 days, that it therefore follows that, since

6

subclassing might, in his view, throw a monkey wrench into

7

a well-oiled machine, that therefore he had no choice,

8

that's wrong as a matter of law.

9

For one thing, the relevant time is not August

10

1993.

It's 1990, when Fiberboard approached counsel to

11

arrive at a global settlement.

12

conflicts were --

QUESTION:

That's when these various

My problem is, not having read your

14

briefs on this and the other side, I don't see how I could

15

make a judgment as to whether Judge Parker was right or

16

wrong in his weighing of several factors to come to the

17

conclusion that the representation was okay, without

18

familiarizing myself in great depth with the details of

19

this case.

precedent, then the fact that one might have regarded the

2

whole thing as a much more nuanced balance is no longer on

3

the table.

4

that unconflicted representation as a matter of law can be

5

judged de novo by this Court.

QUESTION:

7

It seems to me that the principle of Amchem is

Are you talking about representation

in terms of attorneys, or in terms of class members?

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

10

MR. TRIBE:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. TRIBE:

Both, primarily -The rule -We know that -Rule 23 says nothing about attorneys.
Well, it -- the focus on adequacy of

13

representation has been interpreted by this Court to mean

14

that not only must the class representatives meaningfully

15

speak for the groups in question, but that the attorneys

16

must have the ability meaningfully to represent them,

17

since, as this Court knows, it's the attorneys that are

18

making this deal.

19
20
21

22

Here, the class representatives were added as an
afterthought, after the deal was structured.

QUESTION:

1

2

-- if you can't certify under

(b) (1) (B), all the rest of it is beside the point.
MR. TRIBE:

3

It seems to me that the reason you

4

can't certify under (b)(1)(B) is primarily that there is

5

nothing in this case that remotely resembles a limited

fund.

would be more than exhausted by competing claims.

Well, what if the corporate assets,

the bulk of them were put into the mix, and there it is.

11

That's all there is, folks.

12

MR. TRIBE:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Well, here -Could that not meet the rather loose

language of (b)(1)(B)?
MR. TRIBE:

Several points, Justice O'Connor.

16

First of all, in this case 2/10ths of 1 percent of the

17

corporate assets were put in, not quite the whole thing.

18

QUESTION:

I know.

I'm just asking you whether

19

you can envision a situation where substantially all the

20

assets of the company are put into it and here it is.

That's all there is.

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

3

MR. TRIBE:

4

QUESTION:

5

Right.
Maybe there's -Well, no court --- the will that remains so that the

company could somehow string it out and stay in business.
MR. TRIBE:

6

Well, if there were not, as there is

7

in this case, a potentially unlimited insurance fund,

8

which I do want to turn to, and if, therefore, when we're

9

in that category of cases where you can predict insolvency

10

from a stream of liability judgments arising from a mass

11

tort, then, if you look at the position that the author of

12

the rule, Benjamin Kaplan, took, and we quote him in the

13

brief, and the advisory committee, it appears -- and no

14

court has yet disagreed with this - - that that is not the

15

office of this rule.
That is, it is not the purpose of this rule to

16
17

provide a kind of jump start on bankruptcy without all of

18

the protections of bankruptcy for treating creditors

19

equally.

20

QUESTION:

But the language of the rule doesn't

21

seem to foreclose that notion.

22

MR. TRIBE:

Well, the language in fact is

23

broader than anything about a limited fund.

24

about the question of whether separate adjudic -- separate

25

lawsuits would create a risk.

It talks

1

QUESTION:

Do you think that --

2

MR. TRIBE:

But you can't squeeze that within

3

this language, because in this case what creates the risk

4

is the chance of a lawsuit involving insurers in

5

California coming out the wrong way, not separate suits by

6

individuals.
Given Parklane Hosiery, those suits are not a

7
8

9

threat.
QUESTION:

Would you recognize the possibility

10

that in personam rights could be determined under a

11

(b)(1)(B) settlement?

12

MR. TRIBE:

Well, I'm dubious.

It seems to me

13

that unless - - unless you have something which is already

14

essentially reduced to equitable rights in an in rem

15

situation, using (b)(1)(B) is already dubious, but the

16

most important point I want to make about (b)(1)(B) --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

You could use it for beneficiaries of

a trust fund, I take it.
MR. TRIBE:

Yes.

But the most important point

20

of (b)(1)(B) is the question of causality and the

21

direction of timed error, basically.

22

this case, when you put in some part of the assets of the

23

corporation and put in also the money from the insurance

24

companies, you get to this limit of $1.53 billion.

25

Keep in mind how, in

exogenous variable.

The testimony in this case, when Mr.

2

Inselbuch, for example, specifically asked counsel for the

3

insurance company, Continental, whether there was any

4

limit, the counsel responded, no, it is not -- it is not a

5

capped amount of money.

6

appendix -- and the ethics expert on their side, Professor

7

Hazard, said that for practical purposes this amount is

8

without limit.

That's at page 281a of the joint

The limit is the amount they were willing to pay

9
10

in order to move class counsel from a (b)(3) class, which

11

was their initial preference, with opt-outs, to a

12

(b)(1)(B) class, and it would be the height of inversion

13

and irony to say that an amount of money that grew in

order for it to squeeze into (b)(1)(B)

is now somehow

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, may I --

17

MR. TRIBE:

That is, the limit has to come --

18

QUESTION:

May I -- do I understand correctly

19

that your position on (b)(1)(B) is that you simply cannot

20

have in any case where the stand-alone claim would be for

21

tort damages, you cannot have a (b)(1)(B) action, maybe

22

(b)(3), but are there any circumstances in which

23

tortfeasors -- a tortfeasor could gather together injured

24

and potentially injured people whose stand-alone claims

QUESTION:

And of the live plaintiffs at that

time, all of their claims were settled outside this.
MR. INSELBUCH:

Plaintiffs' claims in asbestos

are like an unrolling carpet.

8

are filed, some are resolved, and some are yet to come.

9

It's an accident of history where you happen to be when

10
11

At any moment in time some

you make a resolution.
In fact, when you got to August 27th of 1993,

12

when this settlement was reached, the prior claims had

13

already been settled as between Fibreboard and the insurer

14

and the plaintiffs on the basis where they would be paid,

15

they were paid 50 percent in advance, and they would get

16

the rest if there was a coverage case success, if there

17

was a bilateral resolution between Fibreboard and its

18

insurers, or if there was a global like this.

19

That was gone.

But there is no artificial way

you can talk about the past and the present and the future

This case

is about whether or not a class of people facing a common

sought in one court to stay or stop or cut off any claims

MR. INSELBUCH:

QUESTION:

9

Yes.

I think Justice Jackson made it

perfectly plain that there was in that case kind of a

10

jurisdiction by necessity, plus that most of these people

11

were going to get at least mail notice, they all had the

12

same kind of small little claims, and there would be a few

13

that were left out.

But here most of the people who will be affected

15

don't even know that they're going to be affected and may

16

not yet be persons in being.

17

MR. INSELBUCH:

Well, first of all, the issue in

Mullane was not whether I have an interest in collecting a

19

small amount from a common fund.

20

or not the people who managed the fund had committed

21

negligent torts.

MR. INSELBUCH:

Right.

And if you don't have a

decision under one insurance policy about whether there's

Mr. Inselbuch, what is your response

to the remainder of Justice O'Connor's question,

particularly her asking you about the fact that the case

11

was generated from the defense side rather than the

12

plaintiff side?
MR. INSELBUCH:

13

Well, I was there and I think,

14

as the record reflects, surely Fibreboard had an interest

15

in getting the case resolved.

16

discussions were here in Washington at the Dolly Madison

unfair comment that Mr. Tribe has made about how the

QUESTION:

Who is the "we" now, the insurers for

MR. INSELBUCH:

The plaintiffs, the plaintiffs -

- no, the plaintiffs and Fibreboard.

17

negotiations before the insurance companies came to the

yes.

Now we were there to resolve a unitary issue,

whether or not there was coverage, whether we could settle

that question.
QUESTION:

that each of these cases centers around that issue it

seems to me is to misdescribe it.

12

13
14

MR. INSELBUCH:

Well, getting paid seems to be

the most important overriding issue to any plaintiff.
QUESTION:

Sure it is.

But each plaintiff is

15

going to have to make a separate showing about exposure

16

and about the amount of injury, and to lump them all

17

together in one class just because they're all interested

18

in getting money from the insurance company seems to me to

19

go beyond what the rule provides.

20

MR. INSELBUCH:

The rule, the language of the

21

rule, the text of the rule, talks about a common interest

22

where you're going to put at risk as a practical matter

23

the individuals' ability to protect their interests.

QUESTION:

That's not how the rule reads.

If

the most important question is in common.
MR. INSELBUCH:

It doesn't even -- the rule

5

doesn't even require that, you're quite correct.

It just

6

says where there is a risk as a practical matter that the

7

prosecution of separate actions will be dispositive of the

8

interests of the class members or substantially impair or

9

impede their ability to protect their interests.

That's

10

what the rule says, and that certainly was the fact here,

11

because if the litigation had continued and the insurance

12

issues were decided then the remainder of the class

13

members would not have been able to protect what had to

14

have been their most important interest, their interest in

15

getting paid.

16

Surely there were differences among, among their

17

claims, and we did our best once we resolved the insurance

18

issue in crafting a settlement that left each of the

19

individual class members with the ability to resolve those

20

on an individual basis.

QUESTION:

Is there authority -- if we think of

So your exact response to the claim,

since this isn't quite the same thing, that in bringing

14

Well, the history of the Bill of

Peace, of the representative lawsuits that grew out of the

Bill of Peace, was that you have to balance, that the

17

courts have to balance different interests.

fact that either through numerocity or because people were

2

not subject to the jurisdiction of the court, you couldn't

3

bring all the parties before the court, but yet if you

4

didn't resolve the issue you would create difficulties or

5

burdens or problems or penalties or unfairness, then in a

6

proper case where a court would balance those issues, then

7

you would have a class action or what they called a Bill

of Peace or a common action or whatever the names were for

they would bind all of the members of the class

As far as the insurance, do I

they decided that they would settle it, Fibreboard and the

No, they did not.

They did not

settle it.

MR. INSELBUCH:

1

No.

That litigation wasn't

2

stayed as with respect to the Fibreboard issues until this

3

settlement was reached and was spread on the record in the

4

district court in Texas, at which point the parties wrote

5

to the court in California.
QUESTION:

6

Do I understand that with the other

7

insurers who were in the same, that Fibreboard -- that

8

most of the rulings, final rulings, were in favor of

9

Fibreboard in the insurance litigation?
MR. INSELBUCH:

10

Ultimately, the decisions on

11

trigger and scope, which we were terrified would be

12

reversed by the Supreme Court of California, were affirmed

13

by the California appellate court.
QUESTION:

14

So if everything had played out with

15

the insurance company, then Fibreboard would have had its

16

coverage against the insurers?
MR. INSELBUCH:

17

No, not necessarily, because

18

there was still a very important question that the

19

insurance companies raise about whether Fibreboard's

20

practice of settling cases with plaintiffs, billions of

21

dollars worth of settlements with plaintiffs, on an

22

assignment basis under the policy was in breach of the

23

policy, which an intermediate court in California,

24

incidentally, after the settlement was reached, held that

25

it was.

What were the consequences of that?

The insurer

2

would argue next that vitiated the very coverage that the

3

Court of Appeals approved.

4

be litigated and were percolating along, and if all of

5

these insurance issues had not been resolved in this

6

unitary way sooner or later they would have been resolved

7

in one case or another on a litigated basis.
An that litigated basis, as the testimony showed

8

9

And those issues were yet to

in the district court, put these people at an enormous

10

risk that it would be resolved against them in some

11

substantive way and the result then would have been that,

12

yes, they would have had their individual tort claims, but

13

they never would have been able to recover any damages.
In my remaining minutes, let me talk just a bit

14
15

about the common law, because Professor Tribe suggests

16

that under the old cases you had to have an in rem, a res

17

of some kind, and that is not what those cases stand for.

If you go back and look at cases like Lee against Thomas

in 1751, Chancey against May in 1722, where there was a

20

Bill of Peace, a representative Bill of Peace to recover

21

for embezzlement damages, the Adair case, whether a rent

22

charge on the profits would bear an assessment or would

23

not bear an assessment, these were not cases where the

24

litigants were seeking an interest in a res or in a common

25

property.

that in effect the fund that was created was the best

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. TRIBE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

When Mr. Inselbuch says that they do not argue

14

that this is a limited fund, I understand that's now their

position.

16

throughout the history of this case and in the Fifth

17

Circuit that was apparently the theory on which (b)(1)(B)

18

was applicable.

most dramatically put in a question that I think both in

2

one way or another Justice Ginsburg and Justice O'Connor

were asking, and that is just take the ordinary garden

injured, not just exposed but is experiencing injury, who

By what alchemy is it, by what edict of

Congress, or by what inherent judicial authority without

Congress, is it that that ordinary claim gets transmuted

11

into not a first come, first served right to be paid, but

12

some intangible chunk of a fund whose limits are

established from the defense side.

14

there has really been an answer to that question.

not, after all, a case where, for example, the insurance

policies have relevant ceilings on coverage.

MR. TRIBE:

2

QUESTION:

No.
Unless and until the company is

bankrupt and goes out of business, you have no idea how

much money the company's going to have when these later

suits are brought.

something.

10

That's right.

QUESTION:

And certainly the company would not

be discharged.
QUESTION:

11

But didn't they hire an expert in

12

this case to figure out how much money was available from

13

the company?

14

MR. TRIBE:

15

QUESTION:

I'm sorry?
Didn't they hire an expert in this

16

case to make the very calculation that Justice Scalia says

17

could not have been made?

MR. TRIBE:

But they may not have been right.

They were bought for over half a billion dollars by OCS.

QUESTION:

But they were calculating what the

But do you really challenge the fact

that they would have gone bankrupt if this whole thing had

MR. TRIBE:

4

So your argument basically is that

5

you can't bring any of these classes period if there's one

6

person who objects?
MR. TRIBE:

7

Well, but that overstates it.

You

8

can't bring a (b)(1)(B) class when normal legal rights are

9

at stake.

And I don't think that the Respondents are

10

really disagreeing.

If you listen to what Mr. Inselbuch

11

says, he says that this case is unique, which I doubt

12

because there are others around the country waiting in the

13

wings, I know about a number of them, to see if this

14

limited fund theory will fly.
What makes it, he says, unique is that it had to

15
16

be done.

17

had to be done this way in order to resolve insurance

18

coverage.

19

forgotten about, I guess, is the trilateral agreement

20

which was negotiated between the two insurers and

Fibreboard, putting $3.35 billion on the table, and it's

there right now without taking any rights away from any of

the plaintiffs.

There was a death struggle over insurance.

that if we have an insurance fund that's absolutely-

limited, no trilateral agreement, but we're trying to set

3

up a process to bring in everyone who has similar claims,

if there is even one person from a different state who

seems to me.
