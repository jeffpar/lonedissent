ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN R. McALLISTER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. McALLISTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Vaughn Murphy's extraordinary hypertension is

12

permanent and incurable.

13

his cardiovascular system and on major organs such as his

14

heart, his kidneys, and his eyes.

15

this case that without medication Vaughn Murphy's

16

hypertension limits virtually all of his life activities,

17

and substantially so.

18

It places a constant stress on

There's no dispute in

The fundamental question in this case is whether

19

the Americans With Disabilities Act applies to Vaughn

20

Murphy at all.

21

the ADA applies to Vaughn Murphy for two reasons.

22

he has an actual disability, because his hypertension

23

substantially limits his major life activities.

24

UPS regarded him as disabled when it fired him.

25

Satisfying either of those two statutory alternatives

With all due respect to the lower courts,

First,

Second,

1

establishes only that the ADA applies to Vaughn Murphy and

2

that his suit against UPS should proceed to the additional

3

inquiries that the statute contemplates.

4

QUESTION:

You say that your first point is that

5

he's covered by the ADA because his hypertension limited

6

major life activity.

7

hypertension as medically corrected, or in its original

8

state?

MR. McALLISTER:

In its unmedicated states,

Chief Justice.
QUESTION:

11

12

Are you talking about his

Well, if we were to decide that the

statute contemplates looking at it in the medicated state,

3

is he still limited in his major life activities even

4

medicated, because as I understand it, it doesn't fully

5

correct his condition.

6

MR. McALLISTER:

That's correct, Justice

7

O'Connor.

8

medication he had no limitations whatsoever.

9

respectfully disagree with that, but for purposes of your

20

22

The lower courts both concluded that with

decision, we - QUESTION:

You would suggest that we make the

assumption - -

MR. McALLISTER:

Yes.

state he can function.

MR. McALLISTER:

They make that assumption, yes.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. McAllister --

3

QUESTION:

But you say that even if that's --

4

even if we look at it from the standpoint of his medicated

5

state, if he's regarded by the employer as being disabled,

6

that's enough, of course, under the statute.

7

MR. McALLISTER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, it is.

Mr. McAllister, your client can be

rendered better, and you say we should assume not

10

disabled,

11

whose disability is eliminated by some more permanent

12

physical method, for example, getting a replacement hip?

13

You know, without that replacement hip, I would be totally

14

unable to function, but I have the replacement hip, or I

15

have a heart bypass.

16

regard the criterion as to whether the person is disabled

17

or not?

18

by regularly taking medicine.

What about those

Now, should we -- what should we

MR. McALLISTER:

Justice Scalia, two points in

19

response to that.

20

because they are permanent and, in essence, perfect,

21

basically eliminate the underlying impairment, so then the

22

person would not be under the first prong.

23

QUESTION:

There may be certain corrections that,

Why should that make a difference,

24

then?

25

can be -- let's assume you can be rendered perfect by just

I don't see why it should make a difference if you

taking a pill every day.

2

one hand taking a pill every day does not cause you to be

3

no longer disabled, but getting a replacement heart valve

4

or something like that does.

5

MR. McALLISTER:

Your assertion is that in the

With all due respect, Justice

6

Scalia, we believe there is a difference between those two

7

things.

8

although Vaughn Murphy has to take his medicine every day

9

he has to have variations at times in how much he takes,

One, the corrective measurement is permanent, and

10

which medication - -

11

QUESTION:

So what?

The fact is, every day --

12

my hypothetical is, you render it perfectly normal.

13

mean, we're leaving aside the question of whether he's

14

still disabled after taking the pill.

15

perfectly normal just by taking the pill every day.

16

can't see why it makes any sense to call one person

17

continuing -- to be continuingly disabled and the other

18

person not, just because the one remedy is by some

19

physical means and the other one is by taking a pill every

20

day.

make any difference?

I assume he's

In terms of the purposes of the act, why should it

MR. McALLISTER:

Justice Scalia, it would -- the

23

question seems to be premised on the notion that there is

24

a perfect correction in a case like Vaughn Murphy.

25

many of these cases there's not a perfect correction.

1

That's the theory we're arguing the

2

case.

In response to Justice O'Connor's question, we're

3

setting aside the question of whether he's not, you know,

4

continuingly disabled.
QUESTION:

5

I mean --

It's an easier case to think about,

6

perhaps, in thinking about one that will be argued later

this week, 20/20 vision if you wear glasses, but without

them, terrible, terrible handicap.

at it as though the person were wearing glasses to

Why shouldn't we look

determine whether there's a disability?
MR. McALLISTER:

11

Justice O'Connor,

12

fundamentally, to serve what we believe are the purposes

13

of the statute, the critical question here, first of all,

14

is whether this person is disabled.

15

disabled, because we look at the mitigating measures, we

16

never get onto any of the rest of the statutory inquiry.

17

QUESTION:

If they are not

Well, but I think the regarded as

18

feature protects the person who alleges the disability,

19

notwithstanding the corrective measures.

20

regarding the person as disabled nonetheless?

21

that really hits at the heart of what the statute was

22

aimed at.
MR. McALLISTER:

23

Is the employer
I mean,

I agree with that, Justice

24

O'Connor.

25

it's particularly important in this case.

The regarded as prong is very important, and

It is not --

1

was not in our view properly interpreted by the lower

2

courts, so that you could take the view that if you look

3

at mitigating measures, Vaughn Murphy can do lots of

4

things, but the fact remains that UPS fired him solely

5

because of his high blood pressure.

6

disabled, and yet he got

7

because the lower courts said -- they relied on a DOT

regulation.

9

pressure, and they didn't really think that he couldn't do

10
11

They regarded him as

nowhere in the lower courts

Somehow that's separate from his high blood

all these sorts of life activities.
QUESTION:

Before we get to the regarded as,

12

though, let's talk a little more about, you know, whether

13

he's disabled or not, never mind the regarded as.

14

you do with the very first words of the statute, which

15

says, the Congress finds that some 43 million Americans

16

have one or more physical or mental disabilities?

17

What do

Now, if, you know, corrective measures are not

18

counted, I am disabled in a major life function.

19

I could not do my current job, I could not do quite a few

20

other jobs without glasses, and if corrective measures are

21

eliminated, many more than 43 million Americans -- I mean,

22

I guess it's sort of nice to think that this is -- you

23

know, that a majority of Americans can claim the benefits

24

of the disabilities act.

25

I mean,

That's very comforting.

But Congress did say that -- I think they used

MR. McALLISTER:

5

Isn't that used in the prologue?
Yes, it is used in the

findings.
QUESTION:

Well, how can you possibly say it's a

6

discrete and insular minority if people who, you know,

7

wear glasses and have all sorts of corrective measures for

what would otherwise be disabilities?

9

square with what Congress seems to be talking about here.

10

MR. McALLISTER:

It just doesn't

Justice Scalia, what Congress

11

was talking about was a large group, I think, rather than

12

whether or not it's a discrete and insular majority.

I mean, a lot of Americans wear

glasses and couldn't function without them.
MR. McALLISTER:

Many more --

More than 43 million.

That

certainly is not some sort of a scientific finding.

In

20

our view it suggested that they expected the statute would

apply relatively broadly.

There may be some other ways --

disability requires some reference to the average.

2

MR. McALLISTER:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, it does.

And I presume that by means of that

referenced you would exclude from the class of the

disabled myopic people like Justice Scalia.

QUESTION:

If

you exclude such people as Justice Scalia and me, by

reference to that -- to the criterion of average, is there

any reason to think that the 43 million doesn't work out

The EEOC

language means, compared to an average person, so if there

2

are lots of Americans who share this impairment on an

3

average sense, the average eyesight is not 20/20, it's

something worse than 20/20, so in an average sense,

someone who -- I don't know what numbers it would be, but

That doesn't count because a lot of

other people are the same way?

QUESTION:

No, but everybody who wears glasses

is not close to blind.

wear glasses to get to 20/20, but maybe 20/30, 20/40, and

20

glasses.

QUESTION:

I'm not sure.

I don't see how that works.

is -- imagine a person who has Justice Scalia's vision

I would think so, but do you want to say

everyone with false teeth is disabled?

MR. MCALLISTER:

QUESTION:

The --

I mean, I don't see how to get the

13

statute to work, and therefore I want to know your answer

14

to this question that you started with.

15

say you're right, your client in fact is disabled, is it

16

then necessary to say everyone who wears false teeth or

17

eye glasses is also disabled, or can you find a line that

18

separates out those two instances?
You started down that track.

QUESTION:

It's effectively the line the Fifth

We're not here to draw lines.

I

mean, I'm looking for a line that's in the statute.

6

sure you can draft a statute that would solve that

7

problem, but the issue is, does this statute have any such

8

condition in it, and if so, what language do you rely upon

9

that allows us to make this distinction.

QUESTION:

I could write it in.

It's not the business I'm in.
MR. McALLISTER:

In the findings, Justice

14

Scalia, the finding that UPS talks about in its brief to

15

some extent, Congress speaks to people who have

16

characteristics beyond their control, and there's a lot of

17

legislative history that makes clear they were not

18

concerned about minor, trivial impairments.

the same paragraph that uses the classic suspect category

QUESTION:

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION:

Myopics of the world unite.

If we take the rather vague

4

definition of disability, and if we're trying to find out

5

what Congress meant by impairment, well, all these things

6

are impairments, but substantially limit one or more

7

activity, then why isn't it proper to go back to the

8

findings and purpose and say, well, there's a number here,

9

and that number would be just multiplied if we took your

10

view of what is a disability, and the group -- one thinks

11

of the children that were once herded off into a room for

12

special education as belonging in that discrete and

13

insular minority category, but not someone who may have

14

poor vision but be the brightest student in the class.
MR. McALLISTER:

15

With all due respect, Justice

16

Ginsburg, Congress did not intend -- and this is replete

17

throughout the legislative history, I mean, just the way

18

the statute works as well - - did not intend this statute

19

to apply only to sort of traditional stereotypes about who

20

is or is not disabled.
Now, there are lines that can be drawn so that

21

22

it may be not all 100 million or however many people have

24

of those.

QUESTION:

Mr. McAllister, may I just ask you

why you -- you made a concession.

thought your position was that this man, even with the

medication, can't get himself down to normal because then

he'd have all these horrible side effects.

grounds that he is functional --

MR. McALLISTER:

I'd love to Justice Scalia.

I've stopped you. I 'm sorry.
The regarded-as prong is a very

important part of the definition for precisely the reasons

this case demonstrates.

If you take into account the

10

mitigating measures, people like Vaughn Murphy may not be

11

covered under the first prong,

12

intended to cover, for example, diabetics, epileptics,

13

people who have mitigating measures one way or the other,

14

and in our view he is covered either under the first prong

15

or he's covered under the regarded-as prong.

16

but it's clear Congress

UPS is arguing on the regarded-as prong is

basically he failed to meet a qualification standard that

we think was set basically by the Department of

would always be able to at least assert that we didn't

not how the statute works.

Murphy's ability to do the job, whether or not he can

in fact, precisely because their conditions cause those

You know, it's a rather specific

MR. FELDMAN:

Right, and I think that under

respondent's view of the statute there would be a lot

13

fewer than 43 million. I 'm not sure how many exactly

there are going to be, because I don't know any way to

Congress did just take that number.

QUESTION:

But that isn't a complete answer.

If

15

someone had said 100 million, you know, there's a lot of

that there -- that our view doesn't necessarily lead to

any larger number than that being disabled, and that

respondent's view clearly leads to a smaller number, I

think, a smaller number than that, people who can only

diabetes, the kinds of serious conditions that Congress

intended the ADA - -

QUESTION:

Why would they not be included in
I think they surely would be.

You

10

mean that someone who can only walk with a walker is not

11

impaired, even with the walker, in major life activities?
MR. FELDMAN:

12

No, but to take, for example, one

13

of the examples that's given in the EEOC's regulations, if

14

you take someone who can only walk with an artificial leg,

15

who has only a partial leg and needs a prosthetic device

16

in order to walk, I think respondents would be arguing

17

that person is not disabled, because if he straps on the

artificial leg he can actually walk pretty well.

QUESTION:

I wouldn't think so.

7

MR. FELDMAN:

No, I'm not, but I think the lower

8

courts, some lower courts, since the enactment but not

9

before the enactment of the ADA, have held that conditions

10

such as epilepsy and diabetes are not disabilities because

11

individuals can take medication for those illnesses, and I

12

do think that, as prostheses are getting better, and there

13

will definitely be arguments, and I think respondents --

14

QUESTION:

Well, but you still have the

15

regarded-as prong, Mr. Feldman, to protect against

16

mistaken beliefs as to the person's ability, and I would

17

think that that would make the scheme work pretty well,

18

and then if he's regarded as disabled, despite the

19

corrective measures, you have a question of whether he's

20

qualified, nonetheless, and the scheme works.

MR. FELDMAN:

That'S --

adopt a reasonable interpretation of the regarded-as

2

prong, which I don't think is the interpretation that in

3

my view respondent has advanced, it would take some of the

4

pressure off of the first prong, so insofar as that's

5

true, I'd agree with you.

6

Nonetheless, it still is true that I think

7

Congress, when it enacted the statute, used language about

8

substantially limiting a major life activity which I think

9

is open to either interpretation.

The committee reports,

10

three different committee reports made quite clear that

11

that meant that mitigating measures were not supposed to

12

be included when you're considering whether someone has a

13

disability.

14

QUESTION:

Turning to the regarded as for just a

15

second, supposing a company like this one has a flat rule

16

on blood pressure, that over a certain figure, you're

MR.

FELDMAN:

There -- no.

There is a

3

qualification, and the qualification is,

it has to be a

4

class of jobs or a range of jobs in a variety of classes.

5

If it's just a particular job,

6

I mean, one of the examples in the pre-ADA case is an

7

accountant who has agoraphobia.

If an employer has a job

8

only on the 37th floor and says,

I'm not going to give you

9

that job because you have agoraphobia,

if there is someone who --

that could

10

reasonably be seen as saying you're excluded from only a

11

particular job, and we're not viewing you as disabled in

12

the major life activity --

QUESTION:

No, but in this case,

is the limit

characteristic.

viewing those individuals as unable to - - if they're

It

would mean, it seems to me, that every physical

requirement, at least with regard to blood pressure, would

fall, and the company would have to be able to prove that

4

there's an independent reason for not hiring the person.

MR. FELDMAN:

I don't think that that's true.

The reason it's not true, because

What the lower court held is that

because UPS viewed Murphy as unable to satisfy the DOT
safety regulations, it therefore did not regard him as
substantially limited in employment.

That's the holding

of both of the lower courts below, and that's the only
holding that either of them - QUESTION:

The test isn't substantially limited

in employment, is it?

I thought substantially limited in

a major life activity.
MR. FELDMAN:

a major life activity.
QUESTION:

Well, does unemployment -- an

unemployed person have no major life activity?
MR. FELDMAN:

Well, not every individual may

have each of the listed major life activities.

working is a major life activity, but what I'd like to

in the major life activity of working, with a second point

which UPS has made in its briefs in this Court but which

wasn't reached in the courts below, and that's the

question of whether the class of jobs involved in this

particular case that UPS viewed Murphy as unable to do,

7

whether that was sufficiently broad.
That's an issue that hasn't -- that it seems to

8

me to be in dispute at this point, and neither court below
10

looked at the summary judgment record and made any

analysis on that point, and so therefore I think an

MR. KILBERG:

Not with that degree of

7

QUESTION:

All right.

If it can't, does it

8

nonetheless take an approach, so that an agency, seeing a

9

silence in the statute as to the counting of corrective

10

devices, or mitigating devices, that an agency, with that

11

as a guide, could create lists as to when you do count a

12

corrective device, when you don't count one, always with

13

the notion of combatting prejudice as the guiding goal?

14

Is that possible?

MR. KILBERG:

If I

to the idea that it's up to the agency case by case, or

kind by kind, et cetera.

9

MR. KILBERG:

Well, the -- we believe here that

10

prong 1 of the statutory definition defines disability as

11

an impairment that substantially limits the major life

12

activities of a particular individual.

13

Brought down to this case, it simply cannot be

14

said that Mr. Murphy's impairment substantially limited

15

his major life activities, because as a result of his

16

medication he does not suffer any limitations, and his

17

personal physician so testified, and that's -- in terms of

18

the joint appendix, I would refer the Court to 63a of the

every day activity that an every day person does.

1

Mr. Kilberg, I assume that if we

2

reject your is argument, I mean, even if one assumes that

3

your is versus would argument is wrong, it is still your

4

position that the statute requires an either-or.

5

I mean, either corrective measures are included,

6

that's a plausible interpretation of the statue, or

7

corrective measures are not included, which may be a

plausible interpretation of the statute, but I don't see

any way to interpret it to say that corrective measures

subject, and rather than reading it either-or, it becomes

2

up to the agency to say where, looking at the purpose of

3

the statute, you would do it this way, and where you'd do

4

it the other way.

5

Indeed, I gather in most cases in the Government

6

they do look at the person's condition without corrective

devices, but in the case of glasses, the Social Security

8

Administration looks at them with corrective devices, so

9

why do we have to say either-or?

Why couldn't it be up to

10

the agency to say where and when and under what

11

circumstances?

12

MR. KILBERG:

Because in this case, Justice

13

Breyer, the statute is clear.

14

the statute is subject to only one interpretation.

term disability means, with respect to an individual, a

16

physical or mental impairment that substantially limits

one or more of the major life activities of such

individual.

I'm not giving up yet.

That is to

say,

is -- there's a lot of unfounded prejudice, perhaps,

against people with artificial limbs, or perhaps hearing

that's not true of glasses, and therefore you focus the

9

QUESTION:

Well, that might be this very case,

10

if the statute contemplates that an employer can rely on

11

other Government regulations or employment requirements

12

such as the requirement of DOT that no driver can have

13

hypertension above a certain level.

14

QUESTION:

But the assumption of the question

15

was that we get DOT out of here.

16

those two standards work if we don't have a Government

regulation superimposed on this, that the employer can

The tuberculosis case, the Arline case that this

MR. KILBERG:

Well, but certainly employers can

20

set physical standards.

Numbers of employers have set

21

physical standards with regard to lifting, for example,

22

and the courts have accepted those as not being indicative

of disability and said those are perfectly legitimate

standards.

have not been regarded as being disabled, because that's

QUESTION:

Mr. Kilberg, do I understand your

argument correctly to say that people who have diseases

day, like an epileptic, like a diabetic, that they would

9

be the same, they would not be disabled for purposes of

10

this statute?
MR. KILBERG:

11

To the extent that the

12

ameliorative measure -- in this case, we're talking about

13

pills -- in fact put them on the other side of the line.

14

That is to say, with their medication they were not
