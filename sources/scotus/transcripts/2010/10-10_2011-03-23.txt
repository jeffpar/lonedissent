ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15

prospect of incarceration."

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That categorical rule flows from the

Certainly -­
It's -- it's a formal

17

adversary proceeding in a very limited sense and not in

18

the sense that caused us to require counsel to be

19

provided in criminal proceedings where the other side is

20

armed with the legal knowledge that the poor defendant

21

does not have.

22

counsel on the other side, do they?

MR. WAXMAN:

Many of these proceedings do not involve

Well, Justice Scalia, the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm talking of counsel.

Is

it not true that many, perhaps most, of these

4

proceedings do not have counsel on the other side?

5

6

of the defaulted alimony and does not have counsel -­

7

MR. WAXMAN:

It

I think it is -- the contrary

8

is true.

According to the government statistics, 70

9

percent of noncustodial parents either have no income or

10

have income less than $10,000, and, therefore, in a

11

State -- in every State that accepts TANF funds, which

12

is every State, they are represented by the State

13

agency, and South Carolina in this case has made a rule

14

that in-State cases -- and that also includes nonwelfare

15

cases where the -- a custodial parent has chosen to be

16

represented by the State -- the State entirely carries

17

its prosecutorial burden by filing a rule to show cause

18

and an affidavit showing the arrearages, and that places

19

the burden, which South Carolina says is a heavy burden,

20

on the defendant to prove inability to comply as a

21

condition of maintaining his liberty.

JUSTICE ALITO:

isn't this going to create an imbalance?

proceeding, was she?
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, in this

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. WAXMAN:

Ms. Rogers -- in most of the

2

proceedings, and it does vary from one to the other.

3

all -- let's put it this way:

4

proceedings, the charges and the State's prima facie

5

case of willful contempt was established by a State

6

employee.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

In

In all of the

Yes.

The State employee

8

sends out the -- the rule to show cause and proof that,

9

evidence that the -- the noncustodial parent is in

10

arrears on the child payments.

11

happen if counsel is then appointed in one of these

12

cases, where both the custodial parent and the

13

noncustodial parent are indigent and perhaps not very

14

well educated.

15

So, let's see what would

Counsel is appointed for the noncustodial

16

parent, and counsel comes in and says this is the income

17

of my client, and he's hurt, he was hurt on the job, all

18

his -- his income is Social Security disability

19

benefits, and he doesn't have enough money to pay child

20

support.

21

parent who has no attorney says:

22

I see him, I see him walking around, he's going hunting,

23

he's shooting baskets, he's driving around in a new car.

24

It may not be the -- the title may not be in his name,

25

he's -- he's out on the street corner, he's buying

drugs, he's drinking alcohol, but I don't have a lawyer,

2

and I can't prove any of this.

3
4

So you've created a great imbalance there,
haven't you?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Not at all, Justice Alito.

6

First of all, in all -- in the -- in the majority of

7

cases the department of social services is in fact the

8

real party in interest and the moving party, and in any

9

private case, for a nominal fee the custodial mother can

10

have the department of social services act in that role

11

as Federal law requires the State to do.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Second of

So, why don't you argue for

14

a rule that -- that the State must provide counsel for

15

the defendant in these cases where it has provided

16

counsel or there is paid counsel on the other side?

17

Wouldn't that be fair?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

That would certainly be more

19

than fair, and the number of instances -- let -- let's

20

be clear about this.

21

the State will be required to appoint counsel for the

22

alleged civil contemner will be in cases where -- I

23

mean, there's no reason why the State of South Carolina,

when it issues the summons and the affidavit, says fill

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

When you asked -­

Mr. Waxman, in your

12

opening statement, you said whenever, in civil contempt,

13

a person is subject to incarceration he or she is

14

entitled to counsel.

15

didn't limit it to cases like the case we have before

16

us; that is, where the defense is I'm unable to pay.

17

Therefore, I can't get out of jail.

18

In your opening statement, you

Are you limiting -- are you limiting your

19

argument to the case of a noncustodial parent or a

20

former husband who says I just haven't got the

21

wherewithal to pay?

22

that anytime someone is subject to incarceration they

23

must have counsel?

24
25

Or are you making a broader claim

MR. WAXMAN:

It is definitely the broader

claim; that is, this -- this decision about counsel has
Alderson Reporting Company

to be determined ex ante, because the State -- and this

2

is our -- I suppose our more limited request for a

categorical rule.

placed the burden on the noncustodial parent -­

Where you have a State that has

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

just follows from what I think Justice Ginsburg must

commonplace if the witness declines to testify even

9

My understanding is that it's a

witness declines to produce a document, the judge says

you will remain in jail until you comply.

12

the States, I think he's allowed counsel, but does the

13

broad statement that you -- or the broad argument that

14

you responded, that you're making when you answered

15

Justice Ginsburg's case, apply there, so we are in

16

effect saying in all these cases you must have appointed

17

counsel?

18

MR. WAXMAN:

No, no, no.

In most of

Our submission is

19

any case in which the State proposes to deprive somebody

20

with an unqualified right to liberty of that liberty by

21

actual incarceration, there is a right to counsel.

there is a right to appointed -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

"Mr. Bailiff, take him

out."
MR. WAXMAN:

There -- the cases have

4

recognized a distinction, Justice Kennedy, between

5

direct contempt and indirect contempt.

6

contempt, which is a witness in the courtroom refuses to

7

testify, the cases have -- both civil and criminal -­

8

have not required the appointment of counsel or a jury

9

trial or anything like that.

And direct

In -- in a case where the

10

grand jury witness refuses to testify, the cases all, to

11

my knowledge, do require the appointment of counsel

12

because there may be a defense, and someone is being

13

deprived of their liberty.

14

Now, I think it's important -- Justice

15

Ginsburg, you asked me if I have a more limited rule,

16

and in this instance, the limited rule is that certainly

17

counsel requires -- certainly the due process clause

18

requires the appointment of counsel where the State

19

places the affirmative burden on the contemner to

20

demonstrate as a matter of law and fact that he was

21

unable to comply, and, thus, that incarceration would

22

not be unlawful punishment, but lawful coercion.

23

that is, I think, an important distinction.

And

The -­

Mr. Waxman, the

Solicitor General suggests that the failure in this case

defense or what he needed to prove or to bring to court

to prove that.

there is an inability-to-comply defense and that a

18

sentence imposed where there is an inability to comply

19

is unlawful under Gompers and Bagwell, and for that

20

matter under South Carolina law, is that the showing

21

that the -- the burden that the defendant has to

22

shoulder, the shoulder -- the showing that the defendant

23

has to make is both legal and factual, and neither one

24

of them is straightforward.

because there are lots of legal questions built into the

At least up until the

accident.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Exactly.
It was up until then.

But the point is that -­

13

intentional underemployment, the drug use, the ability

14

to incarcerate somebody so that they can reduce their

15

arrearage on a work release program, perhaps the

16

requirement that he sell his $1,500 car -- those are all

17

legal questions as to whether the defendant -- they

18

constitute an inability to comply.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And you don't think that

20

an individual is capable of saying, I can't -- I'm -­

21

yes, I am, or no, I'm not using up my money on drugs;

22

that's my preference?

I mean, the -- the first of

Or I have a $1,500 car,

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Sotomayor, even leaving

aside all of those undecided questions under South

Carolina -- legal questions under South Carolina law,

even as to the facts that you've addressed, the burden

is not insignificant.

that -- certifying that he had no income and one asset,

a car worth $1,500.

Appendix.

19

it is in the trial record, and we didn't understand at

20

the time we were filing that the United States would be

making an argument that the submission of a, quote,

MR. WAXMAN:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel!

Mr. Chief Justice, I'm sorry.
You have stressed

6

that the burden in this case is on the defendant.

7

your position be different if the burden were on the

8

complainant?

9

MR. WAXMAN:

Would

I think the case would -- our

10

case would not be as strong.

To be sure, in the

11

criminal -- in the criminal contempt context, the

12

burden, of course, is on the State and to prove beyond a

13

reasonable doubt, but there is an acknowledged right to

14

counsel, and there was for decades before this Court

15

considered criminal contempt to be a crime within the

16

meaning of the Sixth Amendment.

17

So, I think we would still -- even if the

18

burden had shifted, the broader rule we're asking for

19

is, look, the -- here the State is sending a man to jail

20

repeatedly on the premise of exacting compliance with

21

court orders and on the theory that he holds the keys to

22

his own pocket because he can always choose to comply.

23

And our submission is that when the State uses that

24

sanction on the basis of that theory, due process

25

demands that it guarantee the assistance of counsel to

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. WAXMAN:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Waxman -­

That's our -­
-- suppose the Court thinks

7

that -- suppose the Court looks at this record and

8

thinks this is a broken system and a violation of due

9

process, but requiring a counsel in every case may go

10

too far, and there may, in fact, be alternate procedures

11

that a State could adopt that would comply with due

12

process.

13

it's, instead, the solicitor general's submission.

14

if pressed on that point, what procedures do you think

15

would be capable of giving a person in this situation a

16

fair shake at this?

17

And I know that this is not your submission;

MR. WAXMAN:

But

Certainly -- I mean, we think

18

that, given the way the adversary system works and given

19

the legal nature of the determination that a judge makes

20

depriving somebody of liberty, and given the significant

21

burdens that are faced in carrying the burden to

establish that, there are none.

be what Justice Powell, providing the fifth vote in

Mr. Waxman, for those of us

who think the Due Process Clause doesn't contain

19

contains what the people who ratified it thought it

20

contained, what's the earliest case that you have which

21

adopts the proposition that you're now espousing, that

22

whenever a civil contempt citation is imposed upon an

23

indigent person, that person is entitled to counsel as a

24

matter of due process?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Scalia, if I had such a

case, it would have appeared quite prominently in my

2

brief.

3

points about history and what the Due Process Clause

4

means, notwithstanding what some of us might like it to

5

mean.

6

There is no such case, but let me make two

First of all, history -- the history is

7

very, very complicated, and it doesn't dictate the

8

answer.

9

not between civil or criminal contempt, but direct or

The traditional distinction along the lines was

10

indirect contempt, and as I know Your Honor knows

11

because you've written it, traditionally at common law,

12

I mean, counsel was provided for civil cases and in

13

misdemeanor cases, but not felony cases.

14

The criminal/civil distinction in contempt

15

arose in this Court around the turn of the 20th century,

16

and it arose so that the courts could exercise more

17

supervisory review over the imposition of criminal

18

contempt by courts.

19

Now, in Cooke and Oliver, this Court, as I

20

said, long, long before it recognized that criminal

21

contempt was a Sixth -- a crime entitled to all Sixth

22

Amendment protections, held that because of the nature

23

of the deprivation of liberty, the appointment of

24

counsel was required.

25

this Court has recognized, the distinction between civil

And our submission here is, as

and criminal contempt is the question of whether you

2

have coercive imprisonment or imprisonment as

3

punishment.

4

And in almost every case, the sentence

5

involves some aspect of both, and where the only thing,

6

the only thing, that keeps the coercive imprisonment

7

from being unconstitutionally punitive absent a jury

8

trial right and proof beyond a reasonable doubt and

9

counsel, is the ability to comply with the court's

order.

MS. KRUGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In civil contempt proceedings to enforce

11

orders for child support, due process requires a

12

meaningful opportunity to be heard on the simple and

straightforward, but critical, question that

I'm not

Could you speak more loudly?

17

MS. KRUGER:

I'm sorry.

Certainly.

18

The first is -- as, Justice Sotomayor, you

19

referenced earlier, the first is information in advance

20

of the hearing that a critical question to be answered

21

at the hearing is going to concern ability to pay and a

22

form or other type of procedure that would elicit

23

information that's relevant to the alleged contemner's

24

financial condition.

25

The second would be a hearing at which the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

27
1

alleged contemner has the opportunity to respond to any

2

further inquiries that may be triggered by information

3

that's already been provided.

4

common feature of many systems outside of South Carolina

5

which, by case law, have recognized that when a court

6

has concerns that information on a financial affidavit

7

might be misleading or inaccurate, they have a duty to

8

inquire further and to require supporting documentation

9

as necessary to confirm or dispel concerns about the

10
11

This is, I think, a

accuracy of the information.
And then, finally, I think we would require

12

an express finding that the -- the alleged contemner has

13

the ability to satisfy the purge conditions such that

14

the person can be said, not only theoretically, but also

15

realistically, to have the keys to the jail cell in

16

their pocket.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, as I -- and

18

then I think one of the deficiencies in addressing your

19

argument is that I don't really know what the State's

20

procedures are.

21

has said that there was actually a form.

22

what that form looks like.

23

Your -- your co-counsel, or Mr. Waxman,
I don't know

The only thing that does seem missing that

the State clearly provides is a requirement that the

28
1

I'm looking at 60a and 61a, and this judge left it

2

completely blank.

3

facially, or is this a due process violation as applied,

4

meaning it's just not clear to me whether South -- the

5

State's process, in fact, has all of the elements that

6

you're speaking about or how I make that judgment and

7

whether the -- we didn't grant cert on the question of

8

whether, as applied, there was a failure or not.

9

So, is this a due process violation

I mean, one of the difficulties in this case

10

is that there was really very -- no findings by the

11

judge whatsoever.

12

MS. KRUGER:

I think that's right, and I

13

think it's also right that South Carolina, at least

14

insofar as the record reveals, doesn't require a finding

15

that the alleged contemner has the ability to comply

16

with a purge condition, as opposed to requiring a

17

finding of willful violation of the court's order.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the -- the form,

19

the order for contempt of court itself, 61a, does

20

require the judge to fill out an answer as to whether he

6

of counsel, satisfy each of the three procedural

7

protections that I outlined earlier in response to

8

Justice Kagan.

9

We know anecdotally from talking

So, for example, in New Mexico, which hasn't

10

recognized a categorical right to appointed counsel,

11

there is a solicitation of financial information in

12

advance of the hearing.

13

a caseworker, who will make the decision whether or not

14

to refer the case to civil contempt proceedings.

15

is a hearing at which further information is explored or

elicited, and ultimately there's a determination made

whether the alleged contemner has the ability to comply.

think given the nature of the inquiry which goes to

for the form to elicit that information.

appropriate for the form to elicit that information as

But I think in substance the form would look very

much like the form that this Court sees on a regular

basis attached to its petitions for writs of certiorari

4

and would also look very much like forms that are

5

commonly applied in jurisdictions across the country in

6

child support programs in order to establish the amount

7

of child support obligation in the first place.

8

Carolina employs such a form for that purpose, and I

think it would be a relatively trivial matter for South

enforcement.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. BIBAS:

No -- Your Honor, I believe the

25

argued in the courts below, is an absolute categorical

right that any loss of liberty equals an absolute right

2

to counsel.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it -- it does seem

4

that absolute right and Mathews v. Eldridge is not quite

5

a -- a good fit, but it seems to me that most of Mr.

6

Waxman's argument can be subsumed within the Mathews v.

7

Eldridge framework.

MR. BIBAS:

Yes, that is his fallback

argument, though it wasn't developed in the courts

below, but I think it's important to note that because

11

his argument approaches and, in fact, leads with an

12

absolute claim -- to note the breadth of the rule.

13

picking up on your question to Mr. Waxman, Justice

14

Kennedy, it's important to note not only that

15

Petitioner's rule would reach other civil contempts

16

beyond child support, but because any loss of liberty is

17

the overwhelming factor in his calculus, it would apply

18

to tens of thousands of immigration and extradition

cases each year.

And the evidence is relevant both to the

5

need for these procedures in the balancing test Justice

6

Kennedy refers to, but also the apparent relatively low

reason to believe there's a large error rate here.

8

According to that study, many parents -- non-supporting

9

parents are cited for contempt and purged of their

10

contempt; many fewer are, in fact, confined.

11

appears to be the threat that coerces enforcement and

12

deters violation.

13

after the contempt hearing and confinement is imminent.

14

So, States would have to appoint counsel in a large

15

number of cases, most of which wind up purging.

do not have the wherewithal to pay.

judges need to be able to protect themselves.

Hicks said a judge needs to know ex ante

imposed here is in fact a determinate sentence with a

then it is civil.

are good enough.

If the rule were you have to get a stay, we

In

abortion cases, election cases, stays are practically

impossible.

This is a different category of case, where

stays are available, and those cases also seek

prospective relief.

12

If I might go back to the financial interest

care here -- it's not that -- there's a State fisc

interest that's substantial, but the reason that matters

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel, I don't understand

how we could say that if you do not meet minimum due

I mean, once we say that it's

10

enough if you do A, B, and C, but this State has not

11

done A, B, and C, how can we say therefore you must

appoint counsel?

back to Justice Kennedy's point, if -- if the Court were

concerned about more specific guidance, it could point

to at least in situations that involve relaxed informal

20

rules of procedure, where no rules of hearsay

authentication, no jury trials, informal discovery,

there, there might be no right to counsel.

It's important to go back, if one looks at

the roots of the right to counsel in Powell and Gideon

conclude?
Litigants can themselves argue the

commonsense issue of ability to pay, just as they can

MR. WAXMAN:

you, Mr. Chief Justice.

I have three points.

First of all, I mean this -- the crux of

this dispute comes down to whether this is some -- akin

7

any layperson, no matter how uneducated, can deal with.

Second, the question is how much of a burden
is this going to be on the States?

10

And, third, the question of whether or not

11

what counsel suggests as the Utah model or what he

12

denigrates as the New Jersey model would be a way to

13

square this circle.

First of all, counsel says he can't conceive

15

of a legal issue that can arise in this case.

16

just look at this case as an example.
