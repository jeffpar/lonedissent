Mr. Heft.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. HEFT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
William Freeman's plea agreement, his

12

presentence report, and the sentencing record all show

13

that his term of imprisonment was based on a crack

14

cocaine guideline that was retroactively lowered by the

15

United States Sentencing Commission.

16

the Court to decide whether the fact that a sentencing

17

court accepted a plea agreement under Criminal Rule

18

11(c)(1)(C) precludes eligibility for a sentence

19

reduction under section 3582(c)(2).

20

Mr. Freeman is not barred from eligibility for a (c)(2)

21

sentence reduction for several reasons.

22

This case asked

We submit that

First, under the ordinary definition of

23

"based upon" and in the context of this particular

24

statute, since the subsequently lowered guideline was

25

used to determine Mr. Freeman's term of imprisonment,
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that term of imprisonment was based on the subsequently

2

lowered guideline.

3

Second, the categorical ban on eligibility

4

adopted by the Sixth Circuit and advanced by the

5

Government frustrates the purpose underlying section

6

(c)(2) and finds no support in the plain language of the

7

statute, of the rule, and under the terms of

8

Mr. Freeman's plea agreement.

9

Third, a record-based analysis that reviews

10

the plea agreement, the presentence report, and the

11

sentencing record to determine the basis of the sentence

12

is -- is best suited to correctly implement section

13

(c)(2), and it's -- that record-based analysis supports

14

the conclusion that Mr. Freeman's sentence was indeed

15

based on a retroactively lowered guideline.

16

Sixth Circuit -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- the

If -- if we issue an

18

opinion and we analyze the statute's language, the

19

statute's purpose, and the statute's legislative

20

history, would the opinion, the judgment be based on

21

each of those or -- or not?

22

everything that goes into the final determination, would

23

you say that determination is based on each of those

24

factors individually?

25

MR. HEFT:

Yes.

In other words, does

Certainly, it is based -­

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the determination certainly would be based on the

2

statute, Your Honor, but, as we've -- we've argued in

3

our brief, we've asked the Court to take what we believe

4

to be a record-based analysis and look at -- look at the

5

record in this case, look at the terms of the plea

6

agreement, look at the -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No.

My -­

I'm sorry.
I think my question

10

goes in a different direction.

11

think, could be said to be based on the sentencing

12

guidelines, but it is also based on the agreement.

13

other words, the combination of the two of them is what

14

gives you the -- the sentence.

15

based on only the sentencing guidelines when it may not

16

have been imposed in the absence of the plea agreement?

17

Probably wouldn't have been.

MR. HEFT:

This plea agreement, I

In

So how can you say it's

Mr. Chief Justice, we don't

19

believe that that's mutually exclusive.

20

be a guideline -- a sentence based on the guidelines,

21

and it can be a sentence based on a C plea agreement.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

A sentence can

You quote one definition

23

of -- the noun "base" in your brief uses a point from

24

which something can develop, but you omit another

25

standard definition of the term, the principal element
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

or -- or ingredient of anything, considered as its

2

fundamental part.

Why do you do that?

MR. HEFT:

3

Well, Your Honor, I -- I think

4

the dictionary definition that we've given encompasses

5

the definition that Your Honor has just -- just

6

described.

The -- and our position -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

7

Well, there's two -- there

8

are two different definitions.

9

provides a starting point for analysis.

10

13

The other is

the fundamental thing on which something is -- it rests.
MR. HEFT:

11
12

One is something that

Well -- well, our contention

is -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, if you use the latter

14

definition, you have to decide which is more fundamental

15

here, the agreement between the parties or the

16

sentencing guidelines, which certainly provided the

17

starting point for the analysis of the sentence by

18

the -- by the district court.

19

MR. HEFT:

Justice Alito, that's correct.

20

The guidelines certainly were the starting point, but

21

they were also the principal foundation of this

22

agreement because what the agreement is -­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Isn't it enough for you

24

to say -- or based not in whole, but in part -- based

25

on, something could be based on several things, and one
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of them is the guidelines that then existed?
MR. HEFT:

2

Certainly.

Certainly.

And this

3

-- this plea agreement reflects that it was based on the

4

guidelines.

If you -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Well, then are you

6

saying the plea agreement was based on the fact that he

7

was caught with -- with two guns rather than four guns?

8

Would you be willing to say that?

9

everything -- your position, it seems to me, could be

In other words,

10

criticized for saying everything that contributes to the

11

final 106 months, that that sentence is based on every

12

one of those things -­

13

MR. HEFT:

Well -­

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- which makes the

15

-- which makes the statutory language largely mute on

16

this.
MR. HEFT:

17

Well, Your Honor, the -- the

18

sentence is based on a number of guidelines.

19

sentence is based on just one guideline, as this plea

20

agreement reflects.

21

guidelines.

22

and as prior -­

It's based on a compilation of

It's -- it's based on the crack guideline,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

Each -- no

Well, it's also

24

based on things that are not reflected in the

25

guidelines.

You've got a particular U.S. attorney who
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is more lenient in prosecuting these types of crimes

2

than another one.

3

under the guidelines might be based on that.

4

on the fact that this person felt he could handle 106

5

months in prison, and he wasn't willing to risk whatever

6

the top -- what was the top sentence under the guideline

7

calculation?

The fact that you got the minimum

8

MR. HEFT:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's based

It would have been 117 months.
So he figures it's

10

better for me to get -- it's based on his decision that

11

I -- 106 months is better than the risk of 117.

12

MR. HEFT:

Well, certainly there are a

13

number of factors that go into plea bargaining and

14

negotiation, but what -- I think what the court has to

15

look at is what is said in that plea agreement.

16

think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed out a minute ago, the

17

definition of "based on" -- if a guideline sentence

18

is -- if a sentence is based in part on the guidelines,

19

that would be adequate under the -- under section -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And I

What sentence would

21

he have gotten if he were just sentenced under the

22

guidelines, no plea agreement?

23
24
25

MR. HEFT:

He would have got the -- he would

have received the same sentence, Your Honor.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

we know that?

The parties

We --we don't

It would have been left -­

There's no plea.

MR. HEFT:

18

You're talking -­

guideline range.

It would be somewhere within that

That's correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

So how can you say

20

that this is based on the guideline range when the

21

guideline range would not have been determinative?
MR. HEFT:

22

Well -- well, we're looking -­

23

we're looking at the content of the plea agreement, Your

24

Honor.

25

The -- the plea agreement says -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Yes, I know, but my

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

hypothetical is in a different context.
MR. HEFT:

2

But even -- even at that, Your

3

Honor, if -- that sentence ultimately is going to be

4

based on a guideline range, and if that guideline range

5

is subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission,

6

then the -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Counsel, could you -­

8

maybe it would be easier if you would describe to us the

9

situations you don't think would be based on the

10
11

guidelines.
The Solicitor General claims that since

12

every plea negotiation has to start with the guideline

13

calculation as a starting point for departure and/or

14

consideration by the judge under 6B1, that every C plea

15

agreement would be considered based on.

16

that position?

17

MR. HEFT:

No, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you taking

Absolutely not.

All right.

So I'll give

19

you a couple of examples, but you give me more.

20

plea agreement that doesn't mention the guidelines at

21

all but picks a sentence within the actual guideline -­

22

is that based on the guideline?

23

MR. HEFT:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

Would a

Possibly, Your Honor.
All right.

And how

about one that departs or varies from the guideline, the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

range, whichever word you want to use?
MR. HEFT:

2

Your Honor, the -- the Sentencing

3

Commission, in 1B1.10 note 3, says that a

4

below-guideline sentence can be based on the guidelines.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

So there -- the

6

Solicitor General is right; there really isn't any

7

situation that you're claiming is not based on?
MR. HEFT:

8
9

Oh -- oh, no, Your Honor.

There

are -- there are C pleas.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

MR. HEFT:

Give me the examples.

All right.

Well, first of all,

12

we've cited cases in our brief where circuit courts have

13

determined that a C plea was not based on the

14

guidelines.

15

But let me give you another example.
Let's just assume the guideline range is

16

something like 151 to 188 months, and then -- but the

17

parties agree to a sentence of 60 months, and they do

18

that for several reasons.

19

defendant is elderly.

20

medical conditions.

21

sexually abused as a child.

22

if that's the reason why the defendant got that -­

23

received that 60-month sentence, that sentence is not

24

based on the guideline range.

25

First of all, maybe the

Maybe the defendant has serious
Maybe the defendant has -- was

JUSTICE ALITO:

If those are the factors,

Well, wouldn't the

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

guidelines, even in that situation, provide the starting

2

point for analysis?

3

and isn't the -- doesn't the presentence report have to

4

go through the guidelines calculation before the

5

sentence is imposed?

6

guideline sentence of whatever the figure was that you

7

mentioned, and then you go from there, and maybe you

8

depart downward.

Isn't the district court obligated,

So you start out with the -- the

MR. HEFT:

9

That -- that's true.

10

guidelines would be the starting point of any

11

negotiation, but -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

12
13

based on the guidelines?

14

big downward departure?
MR. HEFT:

15

The -- the

So why wouldn't that be
Just because there's such a

It -- Your Honor, it would not be

16

based on the guidelines if those other factors were the

17

motivating reason for the imposition of the sentence.
JUSTICE BREYER:

18
19

that.

Sorry, I don't understand

Don't the guidelines provide for departures?

20

MR. HEFT:

They do, Your Honor.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -- and aren't you

22

giving a guideline sentence, if you give your reasons as

23

is required by the Sentencing Commission in 6B1.2 and

24

you say -- the judge says, I think this is a special

25

case and, therefore, I am giving a lower sentence?
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Just

as he's required to do under the guidelines in order to

2

accept a C type agreement.

3

5

MR. HEFT:

If the parties can show that the

sentence is tied to the guidelines.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, how could it not be?

6

Wouldn't the judge have to say it's not tied to the

7

guidelines, because I am varying and I no longer wish to

8

apply the guideline?

9

applying the guideline?

MR. HEFT:

If he doesn't say that, isn't he

In that instance, he would be -­

he would be applying it.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Whether he gives the

13

specific robbery 3-point whatever it is, 17 months, or

14

whether he says, I have a special case and I depart

under section 5 of the guidelines.

16

guideline sentences, aren't they?

17

MR. HEFT:

Both of those are

If the -- if the judge were to

18

take -- were to actually apply those guidelines and say,

19

based on that guideline, I am going to depart, that

20

sentence is based on the guidelines.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So from what base does a

22

judge depart downward?

23

from the downward departure range?

24
25

MR. HEFT:

From the crack cocaine range or

I think it would depend on the

nature of the agreement, Your Honor.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

It may very well

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

depend on -- the judge may depart from the crack

2

cocaine.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So aren't you just

4

asking us to permit district court judges to make up

5

their own C agreement, to decide what the parties would

6

have done in the absence of a higher range?

7

we fall prey to sort of just asking district court

8

judges to create their own agreements?

9

MR. HEFT:

No -- no, Your Honor.

And don't

I don't

10

believe that's -- that's not what we are asking the

11

Court to do at all.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Heft, are you relying

13

on -- this was -- this is a plea agreement that said,

14

specifically, defendant agrees to have his sentence

15

determined pursuant to the guidelines, and then the

16

judge says that he was adopting the probation report and

17

the application of the guidelines as set out therein, so

18

both the -- the defendant says, I agreed to a

19

determination pursuant to the guidelines, and the judge

20

says, I'm going to apply the guidelines in giving you

21

your sentence.

22

So the hypotheticals we're talking about are

23

quite far afield from where you have a specific

24

statement by the defendant and the sentencing judge that

25

the guidelines are being applied.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. HEFT:

That is correct, Your Honor, and

2

that's why we've asked the Court not to take a

3

categorical approach to this issue, but to take either a

4

case-by-case approach or a record-based analysis, to

5

allow the district judge to determine, as Justice

6

Ginsburg pointed out, what our -- you know, what is the

7

--

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Heft, would you require

those kinds of statements in the agreement or in the

10

colloquy in order to satisfy the standard?

11

those statements just didn't exist.

12

MR. HEFT:

Suppose

That's certainly problematic,

13

Justice Kagan.

If those -- if there was nothing in that

14

plea agreement to tie the sentence to the -- the

15

sentence -- the agreed sentence to the guidelines, that

16

certainly would be problematic.

17

But that doesn't resolve the issue one way

18

or the other, because the judge would have to consider

19

the presentence report to see if there's a connection or

20

correlation between the agreed sentence and the

21

guidelines, and also the judge could look at the guilty

22

plea colloquy and sentencing transcript to see if the

23

attorneys actually expressed their intent about where

24

this sentence came from.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Heft, that seems very

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

complicated.

You have to look at everything and you're

2

not giving us a lot of guidance as to what you do when

3

you -- when you see these things.

4

case-by-case, all-things-considered approach just seems

5

as though you're going to get a lot of inconsistent

6

decisions.
MR. HEFT:

7

I mean, this sort of

Respectfully, Your Honor, I

8

disagree.

I think this is what district judges do all

9

the time, not just in the context of a C plea, but a B

10

plea as well.

11

plea agreement.

12

have to look at the sentencing transcript to -- to

13

determine whether or not the defendant is -- is eligible

14

for that sentence reduction.

17

They have to look at the nature of the
They have to look at the PSR.

So judges are doing this routinely.

They

They're

doing this -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in every case, they

18

have to go through the guidelines calculation, and the

19

parties have the opportunity to object to the

20

calculation, right?

21

MR. HEFT:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what does paragraph 12 of

23

the plea agreement contribute here, other than with

24

respect to the fine and things besides the sentence that

25

we're talking about?

It doesn't seem to me to add
16

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

anything substantively.
MR. HEFT:

2

I -- well, Your Honor, I think it

3

does, Justice Alito.

I think it does add -- it adds

4

substance, and it adds meaning to that plea agreement

5

because in paragraph 11 where the parties very

6

meticulously go through the offense level, tie that to

7

the guidelines, and then -- then they state in paragraph

8

12, the -- the defendant agrees to be sentenced pursuant

9

to the -- to the guidelines.

That's very clear that the

10

review in the guideline calculation is what the sentence

11

is based on.

12

And -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Can a -- can a sentencing

13

judge be found to have abused his or her discretion in

14

approving a plea -- a C plea agreement which provides

15

for less than the minimum guideline sentence and gives

16

no -- no particular reason for that?

17

appealed as an invalid sentence?

18

MR. HEFT:

Would that be

Well, Your Honor, under -- under

19

section 3742, the government could -- could appeal an

20

incorrect application of the guidelines if that's what

21

Your Honor is referring to.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well -­
But now you're talking

24

about a plea agreement, which the government has

25

consented to whatever this agreement is and whether -­
17
Alderson Reporting Company

whether -- sometimes a plea agreement will say okay, if

you take a plea, we'll drop certain charges or we'll

JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

Let -- let me ask my

question a different way.

13

approve the plea agreement, doesn't the judge have to

14

consider whether it is an application of the guidelines,

15

whether it is wildly inconsistent with the guidelines,

16

whether it does not take into account valid reasons for

17

departure from the guidelines?
MR. HEFT:

18
19

In deciding whether to

Yes.

consider the guidelines.

Right.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

The judge would have to

Then, if that's the case,

21

then every plea agreement is based on the guidelines,

22

every single one, because the judge always has to

23

consider how do the guidelines apply to this plea

24

agreement.

25

MR. HEFT:

Well, Justice Scalia,
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

consideration of the guidelines alone is not enough to

2

determine whether or not that sentence is actually based

3

on them.
JUSTICE BREYER:

4

I don't understand why you

5

resist that.

I mean, that's precisely what the

6

guidelines say.

7

sentences are -- are dismissal charges, where it's an

8

agreement to dismiss.

9

guidelines themselves say that the judge, here's what

The only ones that aren't guideline

is, you can approve it.

what they tell him to do?

You may tell me I'm mistaken.

There's a guideline range.

JUSTICE ALITO:

I don't

That's true.
It's on the cusp.
What if there had been

What if the government in

have to look at, again, what the terms of the plea -­

plea agreement was and what the parties determined.

17

Now, the -- I think what I should emphasize is that

18

we're only talking about eligibility here; and if -- if

19

those -- if those concessions that the government has

20

made would -- would perhaps result or at least in the

21

government's view, result in an unjustified windfall,

22

that -- that's -- that is not a critical factor in

determining eligibility.

25

Because the court would

That could come into play after eligibility

is determined and the judge -- district judge determines

2

whether or how much.
JUSTICE ALITO:

3

How would that possibly

4

work?

Let's say the government drops count -- agrees to

5

a plea on count 1 with a guideline range of 60 to 65

6

months; drops count 2, which would have increased the

7

guideline range to, let's say, 100 to 105 months; and

8

says this is our deal, you know, you agree to -- to 65

9

months and we're going to drop count 2.

10

MR. HEFT:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right?

Yes.
And then the guideline for

12

that is lowered, and you say in determining whether the

13

defendant is eligible, what -- the government would then

14

have to have a mini-trial and prove that the -- prove

Right.

As in this case, there would be a

recalculation of the guidelines to determine if the -­

Alderson Reporting Company

reduced, and then, as the judge said in this case said,

2

if you have objections, let me know; file your

3

objections.

That's where the government could file -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

4

Yes.

The government files

5

its objections and says, well, we dropped count 2.

6

the defendant says, well, I wasn't guilty of count 2.
MR. HEFT:

7

That's -- that's up to the

8

district judge's discretion, whether or not to -- to

9

reduce that -- that amended guideline sentence.
JUSTICE ALITO:

10
11
12

And

How is the judge going to

decide that?
MR. HEFT:

Well, the -- I think that's

13

something that district judges decide every day, whether

14

or not -- because the judge presumably has -- has

15

been -- is familiar with the case, with the presentence

16

report, with the terms of the original plea agreement,

17

with the facts of the case; and the -- and the judge can

18

make an assessment based on those factors whether or not

19

the sentence reduction should be granted and, if so, how

20

much of a reduction should be granted.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But Justice Alito's

22

hypothetical points out -- points up the fact that even

23

though the agreement may mention the guidelines, it may

24

do that just for the purpose of enabling the -- the

25

judge more readily to approve the agreement, but there's
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

no reason to believe that the government is interested

2

in the guidelines, as opposed to being interested in

3

putting this person away for a certain amount of time,

4

especially when another count is dropped and the

5

government says, well, I'll -- you know, I'll drop it

6

if -- if this guy goes to prison for 2 years.

7

the government had known he's not going for 2 years, he

8

is only going for a year and a half or a year, the

9

agreement might not have been concluded.

But if

So it

10

really -- I mean, it doesn't further the intent of both

11

parties, at least, to say when the guideline is changed,

12

the agreement changes.
MR. HEFT:

13

Well -- well, the agreement

14

certainly has been -- was modified by the amended

15

guideline, and that's where the district judge has to

16

exercise his or her discretion whether or not to grant

17

that reduction.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

But in that event, the

19

sweet part would be open to reconsideration too.

20

mean, you can't say, I want the good part, the lowered

21

guideline, but I also want to keep that certain counts

22

are dropped and that a certain quantity of drugs was

agreed upon.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CURTIS E. GANNON

11

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. GANNON:

12
13

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
When a criminal defendant and the government

14
15

agree to a specific sentence and that agreement is

16

binding on the sentencing judge by virtue of Rule

17

11(c)(1)(C), the resulting sentence is based on the

18

parties' agreement.

19

guideline range that would otherwise have been used at

20

sentencing, even if the sentence corresponds to that

21

range.

It is not based on the advisory

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Counsel -­
Well, here the agreement

24

at various points says that the parties agree on the

25

calculation of the guideline.

I think it's paragraph 11

27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and 12.

They say that the sentence is according to the

2

guidelines.

3

throughout, and the court made the guidelines

4

calculation.

So there's reference to the guidelines

5

MR. GANNON:

The court certainly made the -­

6

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So it seems to me fair

7

under the statute to say that it is based on the

8

guidelines.

9
10
11
12

MR. GANNON:

Well, the question -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And there are other

provisions in the agreement you might argue about.
MR. GANNON:

Well, I think the statutory

13

question here isn't just whether the sentence is based

14

on the guidelines.

15

whether the defendant was sentenced to a term of

16

imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has

17

subsequently been lowered by the Commission.

18

not just whether the guidelines played a role; it's

19

whether this particular sentencing range was what was

20

driving the sentence.

21

The language under 3582(c)(2) is

So it's

And, Justice Kennedy, you point out pages

22

25, 26 of the plea agreement in the Joint Appendix.

23

I think it's instructive that the agreement deals

24

differently with the fine component, as Justice Alito

25

referred to earlier, than it does with the term of
28
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

imprisonment.

At the bottom of page 25, the agreement

2

says that a fine will be at the lowest end of the

3

applicable guideline range.

4

pages 27 and 28 in paragraph 11, that's where the

5

guideline calculation occurs.

6

incomplete calculation.

7

up with a final calculation because they don't come up

8

with a criminal history.

And notice it is an

The parties don't actually come

They don't -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

And then if you go over to

Well, they do come up with

10

a recommendation, which is three levels below the

11

otherwise applicable guideline.
MR. GANNON:

12

They -- they come up with a

13

recommendation for purposes of determining the offense

14

level, the base offense level of 22 and then reduced to

15

19.

16
17
18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Yes, but that's all based

on the guidelines.
MR. GANNON:

Well, that aspect is based on

19

the guidelines, but then the guideline application

20

computation is incomplete because the next paragraph,

21

paragraph B, says we aren't agreed on what the criminal

22

history is going to be.

23

paragraph C specifically says that the foregoing

24

statements of applicability of sections of the

25

sentencing guidelines are not binding upon the court.

And to the next paragraph,

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

The defendant understands the court will independently

2

calculate the guidelines at sentencing; that is -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

3

But that doesn't mean that

4

the court can't base its conclusion on his

5

independent -- on its independent judgment on the

6

guideline.
MR. GANNON:

7

Well, I think what I'm trying

8

to say, Justice Kennedy, is the agreement expressly

9

contemplates that the judge needs to determine the

10

applicable guideline range for purposes of determining

11

what the fine will be.

12

way the plea agreement deals with the term of

13

imprisonment because if we go back to page 26, it does

14

not tie the -- the term of imprisonment to a guideline

15

range.

16

deals with a fine.

17

agreement that the sentence of 106 months of

18

incarceration is the appropriate amount.

19

happens to have been at the bottom end of the guideline

20

range that would have been applicable if the parties'

21

agreement -- if the parties' prediction about the likely

22

criminal history calculation turned out to be the right

23

one.

24
25

And that's different from the

That's completely different from the way it
It specifically says there's an

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And so that

Well, you're talking about

what "based on" means, and that's an important part of
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

your argument.

If I could just, while I've got you,

2

jump to this question of what happens on remand if you

3

lose the case.

by the agreement because of the last -­

On remand, I take it, you're not bound

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- the last of section 24

7

says the defendant argues for any sentence other than

8

the one to which he has agreed to and breached the

9

agreement.
MR. GANNON:

10

Well, at that point the remedy

11

for the breach would be that the United States is

12

relieved of its obligations under the agreement.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13
14
15

Would you -- what would

that mean?
MR. GANNON:

Well, I think that's -- that's

16

part of the problem in a case like this where there was

17

a specific sentence agreement, that it's impossible for

18

government to get back the things that it gave up at the

19

time, that were agreed to under -­

20

view, would the government be able to take the position

Yes, except that the

Of any obligation.

what you mean.
MR. GANNON:

Now that the sentence has

15

window for ways in which the otherwise final sentence

16

could be modified.

17

will have the discretion to reduce the sentence if it

18

is, first, a sentence that was based on the relevant

guideline range that's subsequently been amended and

made retroactively applicable.

point?

MR. GANNON:

Well -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The guidelines form part of

the consideration of the judge, but the judge's decision

the agreement -- the guidelines form part of what

Just as here, the -­

produces the agreement, so also they form part of what

produces the judge's decision.

conclusion that 3582 is yet another provision of the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I find it hard to -- I

2

find it hard to understand the analysis that would

3

require courts to decide whether some (c)(1)(C) plea

based on the guidelines.

6

the guidelines, and then the obligation would be on the

of Booker and Fanfan.

15

MR. GANNON:

Well, I think in the context of

an actual specific sentence plea agreement, that is the

one that we think is off the table, because that is what

is going to control the sentence.

MR. GANNON:

whether the judge even had to apply it at all, and the

5

was going to get to is that, unlike the colloquy that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't -- I am not in

48
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

that going back to what had bothered Justice Alito and

2

Justice Scalia on now that the guidelines are not

3

mandatory, is any sentence even under C really based on

4

the agreement?

5

approved by the judge.

Because even a C agreement has to be

The legal consequence is not the agreement.

6
7

That doesn't sentence the defendant.

It is the judge's

8

decision as to what the sentence should be which he

9

denotes in accepting the agreement that binds.
And I think -- I may be making Justice

10
11

Breyer's argument -- that if under the policy statement

12

and it's clear what the judge did here, if the judge

13

feels bound by the agreement or otherwise to calculate a

14

sentence in the guidelines and impose one in the

15

guidelines, how can you say that the legal effect is not

16

the guideline sentence?

17

MR. GANNON:

Well, because I think that the

18

relevant question for purposes of both 3582(c)(2) and

19

the policy statements that the court said in Dillon

20

controls the -- the process of implementing 3582(c)(2),

21

is what did the judge do at the time of imposing the

22

sentence?

23

generally will consider how the type C specific sentence

24

that the parties have agreed upon corresponds to a

25

guidelines analysis at the time of deciding whether to

And so although it is true that the judge

49
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

accept the plea agreement, the relevant phrase in

2

1B1.10(b)1 which is -- which is on page 8A of the

3

government's appendix is that the judge is supposed to

4

go back and look at what --

5

for the corresponding guideline provisions that were

6

applied when the defendant was sentenced.

to only make substitutions

And so when you have a type C plea agreement

7
8

that has a specific sentence even under the terms of

9

this agreement, the only thing that the judge considered

10

when he decided the sentence was going to be 106 months

11

with respect to the term of imprisonment was the binding

12

plea agreement.

That is what rule 11(c)(1)(C) required.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

-- no.

Because you're

14

assuming that the agreement was automatically binding on

15

the judge.

16

MR. GANNON:

It was -­

If he had calculated the guidelines and if it

MR. GANNON:

And had he not done that the

proceeding would have occurred differently and it may

not even have right occurred then, and -- and I think

4

because under Rule 11 if he was rejecting the plea

agreed to, he would have to give the defendant the right

to withdraw the plea at that point.

would have been released from its obligations; the

parties -- the defendant could have gone to trial.

So the government

He

10

could have -- he could have continued to plead guilty.

11

The parties could have come up with a type plea -- B

12

plea agreement.

13

renegotiate a different type C agreement.

14

15

Sotomayor, this is not about asking the judge to step

into the shoes of the parties and renegotiate what the

agreement would have been had the judge decided to

reject it the first time around.

20

contemplates a limited process by which the judge will

21

reapply those provisions of the guidelines that he

22

applied the first time around and -- and make the

23

substitution that is now called for by the retroactively

24

applicable change.

25

actually make that application at the time of

Instead 3582(c)(2)

But here because the judge didn't

51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

sentencing, the judge did not actually have to apply the

2

drug quantity table.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

I am not following that

4

argument for this reason.

It seems to me if you ask

5

what did the judge apply at the time he imposed the

6

original sentence, well, it has got to be the

7

guidelines, because first the agreement provides for it;

8

then he says I am going to wait for the probation report

9

so I can see what the calculation is, whether I agree

10

with it; and then he gives him a sentence that is

11

precisely within the guidelines.
So if you asked me to describe what that

12
13

sentence was -- of what was it, 46 to 106 days -- I say

14

that was a guideline sentence.

15

within the brackets that -- the guidelines.

16

wasn't it a guideline sentence?
MR. GANNON:

17

It was right there
So why

Because for purposes of the

term of imprisonment the judge was not actually applying

19

the guidelines at that point.

20

the fine.

21

fine, but those type C plea agreement here called for

22

the judge to apply the guidelines with respect to the

23

fine and did not call for the judge to apply the

24

guidelines with respect to the term of imprisonment.

25

knew that it was within what the PSR had calculated as

He did so for purposes of

He ended up actually waiving the relevant

52
Alderson Reporting Company

He

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the guideline range and he concluded that that was the

2

applicable guideline range which he needed to do for

3

purposes of calculating the fine and other things, but

4

it wasn't actually the basis for the sentence.
The basis for the sentence was the plea

5
6

agreement that he accepted, and there it was the

7

parties' agreement.

8

that went into the parties' agreement that the judge

9

does not have the wherewithal to reconsider in

10

And there are all sorts of things

retrospect.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

I thought one of the

12

things in the plea agreement was that the -- that the

13

judge would have the right to himself calculate the

14

guideline range.
MR. GANNON:

15

Yes.

And that specifically

16

contemplated in Rule 11(c) and in the guidelines, that

17

the judge may postpone acceptance of the plea agreement

18

until after the presentence report is prepared.

19

judge did do that here.

20

recommended, but once, and had he decided that he did

21

not like the 106 month sentence and he wanted to

22

preserve his sentencing discretion, the option at that

23

point was to have rejected the plea agreement, at which

24

point the parties would have been free to do different

25

things.

And the

So he was aware of what the PSR

Thank you, Your Honor.

Just a

19

couple of points.

First of all, the record here leaves

20

no doubt that the judge based his sentence on the

21

guidelines.

22

states that the judge and I'd like to quote this, this

23

is at page 47 of the joint appendix and I quote, "the

24

court will adopt the findings of the probation officer

25

disclosed in the probation report and application of the

The sentencing transcript specifically

54
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

guidelines as set out therein."

On page 48 of the joint

2

appendix the judge says, having considered the advisory

3

guidelines, he went on to impose that sentence.

4

is quite clear that the judge and even in his statements

5

of reasons on page 95 of the joint appendix, again

6

reaffirmed that this sentence was based on the

7

guidelines.

So it

8

Now, the other point that I'd like to make

9

is that the Government acknowledges that it has carved

10

out a very small exception to its argument that C pleas

11

regarding specific sentences and sentencing ranges are

12

not eligible for (c)(2) relief.

13

reading, taking the Government position into account, if

14

this plea agreement had not stated 106 months, then

15

Mr. Freeman's under the terms of this plea agreement in

16

the Government's view and under the Government's

17

argument of what exception exists under the C pleas for

18

purposes of 3582, Mr. Freeman would be eligible for the

19

relief that was granted.

20

Court in this case to adopt a rule that does not exclude

21

specific sentences and C pleas for eligibility in 3582.

22

Thank you.

But it seems to me that

And we would simply urge the

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

The case is submitted.

25

(Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case in the
55
Alderson Reporting Company

Thank you, counsel.
