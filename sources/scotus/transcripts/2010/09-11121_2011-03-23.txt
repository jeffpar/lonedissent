ORAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MS. BLACKMAN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
J.D.B. was only 13 years old when he was

11
12

taken out of his middle school classroom and escorted to

13

a closed door interrogation conducted by outside law

14

enforcement regarding a matter that did not take place

15

on school property.

16

had already demonstrated an interest in this

17

investigation and sought to shield him from the police.

18

He was not advised that he was free to leave or free not

19

to answer questions until he had already incriminated

20

himself.

21

He was isolated from his family who

The restrictions on J.D.B.'s freedom of

22

movement which existed because of his youth were

23

heightened by the manner in which this officer chose to

24

conduct this interrogation and the expected deference to

25

authority figures categorically characteristic of

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

children were taken advantage of by the manner in which

2

this officer chose to conduct the interrogation.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

3

Ms. Blackman, I'm -- I'm --

4

I'm not clear on what you are proposing.

5

one different Miranda requirement rule for all minors,

6

or is there to be one for, what, 20-year-olds,

19-year-olds, 18-year-olds, 17, 16?

MS. BLACKMAN:

13

Justice Scalia, what we are

14

proposing is that the test be a court may consider age

15

in determining whether a reasonable person in the

So we are not -­
So you mean 15, 14, 13,

Right?
MS. BLACKMAN:

We did not suggest that it be

22

calibrated by age, although in State court jurisdictions

23

many of them are and are not finding that a difficult

24

test to perform.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

It's not -- if not

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

calibrated by age, how is it to be calibrated?
MS. BLACKMAN:

2

It is to be the exercise of

reasonable judgment by the judge taking into account

common sense -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MS. BLACKMAN:

7

-- community experience is

one.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

Common sense?

And -- and -- and how -­

how is the law enforcement officer going into the

10

confrontation going to know whether a judge is going to

11

be applying a 15-year-old rule, a 13-year-old rule, or

12

whatever?

13

MS. BLACKMAN:

Clearly in the jurisdiction

14

in which he practices he should be aware of the fact

15

that a court utilizes that type of -­

Do you think that's clear?
But we're not suggesting that

What a court is examining is -­

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Why isn't this all

subsumed under the voluntariness rule?
MS. BLACKMAN:

As this Court has frequently

22

recognized, the voluntariness inquiry is more difficult

23

for courts to perform than the Miranda custody one.

24

you have also recognized that the court -­

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, at least it's the

5
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court performing it, not the interrogating officer, as

2

Justice Scalia's questions point out.

3

MS. BLACKMAN:

The police officer plays a

4

role in the voluntariness, also.

5

must be assessing whether the circumstances may be

6

giving rise to an involuntary confession.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

7

And the police officer

Age -­

What about mental

8

deficiency, if -- if age should be one of the factors,

9

deciding whether the individual regarded himself as in

10

custody or not, why shouldn't mental deficiency be so as

11

well?

12

I mean, once you do this, don't you, in effect, say that

13

it is a subjective inquiry whether the particular

14

individual regarded him or herself as being in custody;

15

isn't that the -- the basis of what you're arguing?

Is there any -- any basis in principle for not --

16

MS. BLACKMAN:

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18
19

No.
No?

Why is age different

from mental deficiency, for example?
MS. BLACKMAN:

Age is different because,

20

number one, it involves restrictions on freedom of

21

movement, so the circumstances of the interrogation are

22

going to be understood and interpreted differently by a

23

child than it would be by an adult.

24

Secondly, we're talking about cognitive

25

differences which exist between children and adults

which affects their perception and understanding.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

You could say both of those

things about the mentally deficient.

4

themselves as -- as unfree to leave, and they have

5

cognitive deficiencies.
MS. BLACKMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

10

Well, what about this test

11

which comes from three cases, the first being Berkemer,

12

the second Stansbury, and the third I'll tell you in a

13

second?

14

a reasonable person for this purpose and avoiding

15

subjective states of mind, you would look at objective

16

circumstances, known to both the officer and the suspect

17

that are likely relevant to the way a person would

18

understand his situation.

19

It is that those -- what are -- in considering

All right?

So both would be both mental illness and age

20

and -- I don't know, whether you speak English, and a

21

lot of other things would be relevant, provided they are

22

things that are relevant to how a person would

23

understand his situation and are known to both the

24

officer and the individual.

25

The third case, of course, is my dissent in

(Laughter.)

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

But nothing in the majority

4

conflicts with that, that I can see, except the holding.

5

I thought I lost the case, but apparently it's up again,

6

so I don't see why that isn't a perfectly good test.

7

But if you're not going to support it, then I've got no

8

support.
MS. BLACKMAN:

9

Well, we're simply making the

10

point that there's not necessarily going to be a

11

floodgate opening.

And we haven't seen that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

No, no, but I mean what

13

Justice Scalia was really asking is, do you favor

14

something like this test that I read, which is open as

15

to circumstance?

16

long as both policemen and the -- and the individual

17

know it and it is relevant as to how he understands the

18

circumstance, whether he's likely free to go or not.

Anything could fit in that blank, as

MS. BLACKMAN:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Thank you.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Even -- even if you said

21
22

Conceptually absolutely.
Yes, that's

right.

23

no, you're pushing us there, because there's no basis

24

for treating a childhood any differently from these

25

other factors.

So basically you're saying Justice
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Breyer would call it objective circumstances.

You know,

2

whether you're mentally deficient, I would call that the

subjective condition of the -- of the person being held

in custody.

meant by the phrase "objective circumstances."

And I think, I don't think that's what we

10

factors, right?

Those are all objective circumstances?

MS. BLACKMAN:

11

Your Honor, what we are

talking about are a complex of characteristics which are

13

unique to children, and that's what we are examining in

But here it seems to me so rampant because this police

officers, one is assistant principal, threatened with

custody, that that person is not going to feel free to

MS. BLACKMAN:

Yes.
The whole point of

the Miranda rule, I thought, was to provide clear,

objective guidelines about what the police are supposed

And it seems to me that one of the difficulties

10

with your rule, however clear it may seem in this case,

11

but it does have to apply more broadly, is that that's

12

off the table, and now they're not only going to have to

13

know, does this person understand it, but they're going

to have to know, it's not every one of these situations

Why don't we just put those

MS. BLACKMAN:

It doesn't change the rule

2

itself.

I mean, the rule itself remains:

All objective

3

circumstances relevant to the custody determination must

4

be considered.
What it's doing is taking this out of the

5
6

reasonable adult standard, which by default is the only

7

one, then, that can be used, and so it's not going to be

8

muddying the waters in the sense that it is something

9

needed in order to promote accurate fact-finding.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

Would it be -- is it

11

enough if the officers in this situation said, look,

12

you're free to leave, you know, whenever you want,

13

but -- and then goes on -- or do they have to think -­

14

now, maybe -- maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't think

15

that's true, or maybe a 13-year-old really doesn't feel

16

that he can leave if he's got the vice principal there

17

and they want to talk.
MS. BLACKMAN:

18

I mean, that is an objective

19

circumstance that occurs in the course of an

20

interrogation which is very weighty in determining if

21

custody occurs.

Here -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

I'm thinking it

23

would not even be enough if they told the 13-year-old,

24

look, you can leave, but I want to ask you some

25

questions.

And the principal is there, and he thinks,

well, you know -- maybe the 13-year-old is thinking,

2

maybe I'm going to get in trouble if I leave.
MS. BLACKMAN:

3

It involves all of the

4

circumstances which are arising during the course of

5

these interrogations, but certainly advising someone

6

that they are free to leave and advising them that they

Would be one relevant

5

factor that would be considered was that nobody called

It is relevant in this

situation, because -- by North Carolina law.

requirement that a parent or guardian be present.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Well, right.

That's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MS. BLACKMAN:

But that is an additional

2

reason why police officers need to be aware of what the

3

age is of a child that they are interrogating because of

4

independent obligations arising out of State statutes.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So is your answer to

6

Justice Ginsburg that, no, the fact that a parent was

7

not notified is not relevant to the Miranda question?

8

It may be relevant to the voluntariness question.

9
10
11

MS. BLACKMAN:

No, I believe it remains

relevant to the Miranda question, because -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question really is if

12

he is in custody.

And maybe there's something different

13

about being in the room with a juvenile police

14

investigator and the assistant principal and being in

15

that same room with your parents there.

16

MS. BLACKMAN:

That is correct.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Oh, so it's not just

18

that they have to call the parent; they have to wait for

19

the parent to show up?

20

MS. BLACKMAN:

Because of State statutory

21

requirements, here they were.

22

State has that kind of requirement.

I understand that, but I'm

just explaining that independent bases may arise for

MS. BLACKMAN:

If the interrogation is

10

occurring under circumstances where the officer should

12

officer to consider this, and that could arise from -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose -- suppose the

14

person shows an ID and it shows the person is 19 years

15

old, and the officer looks at him and says, he looks

16

like a pretty young 19-year-old?

17

MS. BLACKMAN:

If there is no way to verify

18

the information that the child is giving, then the

19

officer accepts the ID as being the age of the person he

20

is interrogating.

Did you really mean "may," so it's

discretionary with each judge, whether a juvenile's age

8

is relevant to the in-custody analysis?
MS. BLACKMAN:

9

No, it is must.

As with any

objective circumstance, the court has to take it into

account, and we can't be relegating some to a

it's important to know that we have already started

going down the slippery slope in a number of states.

4

There have been 11 states, contrary to Petitioner's

5

brief, that are considering other characteristics in

6

Miranda, such as sophistication, such as education, such

7

as intelligence.

That makes it so much more difficult.

And this Court has not hesitated -- it did

not hesitate in Alvarado; it did not hesitate in

make sure that Miranda is complete, that Miranda stays

clear and objective, and that we don't blur the lines.
JUSTICE ALITO:

13

If the law goes down that

route, then one of the chief advantages of the Miranda

rule, which is that it's a relatively simple objective

test, is eliminated, and the law of Miranda begins to

resemble the law of voluntariness.

The only statements that are

are statements that, first of all, the prosecution has

I think that's a relatively small and not a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But that's all we're doing

2

with the young person.

And in fact, most of us, many of

3

us, have a great deal more experience understanding the

4

world through the eyes of a young person or children,

5

perhaps, than understanding the eyes -- the world

6

through the eyes of a severely sensory deprived person.
We're asking the exact same thing in both

7
8

contexts:

9

do the objective circumstances appear to a person in

10
11

What is this person -- what is this -- what

this situation?
MR. FEIGIN:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

12

you're doing the same thing, and I think it's easier to

13

put yourself in the mindset of a person with a sensory

14

deprivation than a person of a particular age, and let

15

me explain why.

16

For a person with a sensory deprivation,

17

like in Justice Breyer's example, the sign that someone

18

can't read, I think it's very common and easy for

19

officers and courts to figure out how they would react

20

to the situation if the sign simply weren't there.

21

With age, what you're asking perhaps a

22

45-year-old officer to do, in Justice Alito's example,

23

or a 60-year-old judge to do, is to put them into the

24

frame of mind of a person that they haven't been for 32

25

years or 45 years, and I don't think that's a very easy
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

inquiry to ask officers or courts to make.
I think this is really going to complicate

2
3

the Miranda rule by asking them, A, to do that, and, B,

4

because there are going to be many cases, unlike this

5

case, where it's not going to be apparent to the officer

6

what age the suspect is.
One thing that comes up fairly commonly in

7
8

many jurisdictions is that an officer will stop someone

9

on a -- do a traffic stop of someone on the road; the

10

person will claim not to have their ID, and it will turn

out the person is 14 and they will give the name and

47

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are sort of two parts to your question.

Let me deal

2

first with the rule that would only apply when officers

3

know the identity, know the age of the suspect.

4

that rule would be easier to apply than the rule the

5

Petitioners are suggesting and would mitigate some of

6

the damage, but first of all it doesn't solve the

7

critical problem of asking officers who aren't

8

themselves 13 to think like someone who is 13; and

9

second of all, I think for reasons that I think were

I think

10

apparent during the argument by my friend on the other

11

side, that rule might easily devolve into a "should have

12

known" test, and officers simply aren't going to be able

13

to deal with that.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

The officer doesn't have to

think like a 13-year-old, he has to think the way a

MR. FEIGIN:

Your Honor, I may have

5

difficulty dealing with this particular hypothetical

6

because of my lack of knowledge of the particular

7

symptoms of Down's syndrome; but if you're dealing with

8

a suspect who simply can't absorb information about the

world, then that's going to be a sensory deprivation

10

that's going to be taken into account, because it's

11

going to subtract circumstances away that that suspect

12

can't perceive.

13

of someone that has a particular sensory disability,

14

then no, I don't think that would be taken into account

because it's asking too much of officers to try to put

16

themselves in that mindset.

17

But if you're asking about the mindset

And the third problem, I think, with

factoring age into the custody test is that -- and as I

disorders or cultural background, that defendants also

Apparently the people who

25

MR. FEIGIN:

Well, one reason they may think
52

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's a good thing and one reason I think the Court

2

doesn't need to accept Petitioner's rule here, is that

3

officers often will give Miranda warnings, for precisely

4

the reasons Justice Sotomayor was suggesting earlier,

5

which is that when officers do give Miranda warnings,

6

it's going to be -- and those Miranda -- the Miranda

7

procedures are all validly followed, there's not going

8

to be a real robust voluntariness inquiry because in

9

most cases where the Miranda procedures are followed,

10

the statements are going to be found to be voluntary

11

under the voluntariness test.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BARBARA S. BLACKMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MS. BLACKMAN:

I think what's very odd in

4

this case is that the only party that didn't consider

5

J.D.B.'s age was the courts.

6

being taken into account by Officer DiCostanzo, and

7

J.D.B. was fully aware of his own age.

8

Thompson v. Keohane, what a reviewing court is supposed

9

to be doing is immersing itself in the actual

I mean, it was clearly

And under

10

circumstances of the case; and without this

11

consideration of age, then the courts are examining

12

hypothetical, because -- hypothetical interrogations and

13

not the one that was actually occurring in the case.

14

Officers have to make judgments about every

15

objective circumstance that arises, and asking them to

16

make objective determinations on juvenile status is no

17

different and is not going to muddy the water.

18

as Justice Kagan pointed out, custody is a very

19

difficult issue.

20

But we can't be defining it in such a way where we are

21

requiring these children to be someone that they never

22

could be, and that is, reasonable adults.

23

I think

It's not subject to bright line rules.

If our goal here is to ensure reliability of

24

factfinding, reliability of statements, if we want to

25

reduce the coercion, to which our citizens are entitled,

then this rule needs to be put into play, and we ask

2

that the North Carolina Supreme Court decision be

3

reversed.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
