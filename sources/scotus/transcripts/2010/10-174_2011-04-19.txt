CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Keisler.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PETER D. KEISLER

8

10
11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KEISLER:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This is a case in which the courts are being

12

asked to perform a legislative and regulatory function

13

in a matter in which the necessary balancing of

14

contending policy interests is among the most complex,

15

multifaceted, and consequential of any policy issue now

16

before the country.

17

The States ask that the courts assess

18

liability and design a new common law remedy for

19

contributing to climate change, and to do so by applying

20

a general standard of reasonableness to determine for

21

each defendant, in this case and in future cases, what,

22

if any, its share of global reductions in greenhouse gas

23

emissions ought to be.

24

not to interpret and enforce the policy choices placed

25

into law by the other branches, but to make those policy

That would require the courts

3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

choices themselves.

2

that plaintiffs lack standing, that the Federal common

3

law shouldn't be expanded to include this new cause of

4

action, and that the case presents nonjusticiable

5

political questions -- while all of them represent

6

distinct points, All of them flow from the same basic

7

separation of powers principles that establish, we

8

believe, that the case ought to be dismissed.

9

And all of our arguments here -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

MR. KEISLER:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I think that's -­

Now, all of these issues -­
That's exactly one

12

thing that's concerned me.

They do all flow from the

13

same basic argument, and I'm concerned why you think we

14

should focus on prudential standing, basically, which

15

cuts off our jurisdiction at our own whim, as opposed to

16

dealing with this on the merits.

17

MR. KEISLER:

Well -­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In either case, your

19

argument is that this is too generalized for the Court

20

to -- to address.

21

MR. KEISLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, our

22

principal argument has not been prudential standing.

23

The government has focused on the prudential standing

24

argument.

25

case resolved on that basis, but our principal argument

We join that and we'd be happy to see the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

on standing has been Article III standing.

2

actually believe that the Court could resolve this case

3

and address the issues in any order, with one possible

4

exception, which is that we do read the Court's decision

5

in Steel Co. as holding that the Court has to address

6

Article III standing before reaching the question

7

whether there's a valid cause of action.

8
9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And we

Mr. Keisler, what -- what

good does it do you to have this Court say that there is

10

no Article III standing?

11

in State court -­

The suit will just be brought

12

MR. KEISLER:

Well -­

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- under State common

14

law and -- and the States' rules of standing are not

15

ours.

16

MR. KEISLER:

Well, many States, Your Honor,

17

have similar doctrines of standing, similar doctrines of

18

political questions.

19

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

MR. KEISLER:

They only need one.

Well, in any event, Your

21

Honor, we believe we would have a very strong motion to

22

dismiss in State court on a variety of grounds,

23

including -­

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
are we?

We're not sure about that,

So we -- we -- we -- may be just spinning our
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

wheels here.

2

MR. KEISLER:

Well, I don't -­

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Indeed, you know, tapping

4

the case to State judges instead of Federal judges, I

5

would frankly rather have Federal judges do it,

6

probably.

7

MR. KEISLER:

Well, as I said, Your Honor, I

8

think we would be able to defeat a State common law

9

claim on grounds of State law, for lack of proximate

10

cause, on standing and political question grounds that

11

many States have that parallel these; but in any case,

12

whichever ground the Court resolves this case on, we

13

think it's clear that the cause of action can proceed.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, if -- if you had a

15

State court suit with a State plaintiff, wouldn't the

16

State be able to adduce Federal common law as a ground

17

for recovery?

18

see if there is a Federal common law cause of action.

19

And then we would get to the merits and

MR. KEISLER:

It's -- it's possible, Your

20

Honor, although we think they would be more likely to

21

proceed under State common law.

22

don't think the elements of a State or Federal common

23

law cause of action under nuisance could be met here,

24

and we're very confident we could defeat that claim in

25

State court as well.

But either way, we

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, we all -- we all

2

know that you sometimes have to peek at the merits to

3

see if there's standing.

4

goes on.

5

that you're lacking any clear precedent.

6

of standing, I think of Frothingham v. Mellon.

7

isn't this case.

8
9

There's a little cheating that

But -- but in this case it does seem to me

MR. KEISLER:

When I think
That

But the Court has said in

Warth v. Seldin that the plaintiff has to demonstrate

10

that it will benefit in some tangible way from the

11

Court's intervention.

12

And that's -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you have -- if you

13

have the precedent of Massachusetts v. EPA and if any

14

one plaintiff has standing, I guess that's enough.

15

if you look at standing alone, it seems to me the States

16

would have standing on the same basis that Massachusetts

17

had standing.

18

MR. KEISLER:

So

Justice Ginsburg, we believe

19

that Massachusetts was very carefully qualified to focus

20

on the particular regulatory context of that opinion.

21

The Court said that it was addressing standing to

22

challenge the denial of a petition for rulemaking, when

23

the agency would be proceeding incrementally to address

24

a broader problem, and a statute specifically gave the

25

petitioners the right to seek that kind of incremental
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

protection.

2

The statutory right was of critical importance, it said,

3

to the standing inquiry.

4

The Court was very specific about that.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Keisler, the Court did

5

say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual

6

analysis in the case.

7

injury and causation and redressability, the Court never

8

refers to the statutory cause of action.

9

When the Court goes through

MR. KEISLER:

But it does, Justice Kagan,

10

specifically refer to the regulatory context in which

11

the case is taking place.

12

EPA's arguments there about traceability and

13

redressability were adopted, it would doom most

14

challenges to agency action because agencies proceed

15

incrementally.

16

The Court said that if the

Here we have no statute, we have no agency

17

proceeding incrementally, and we believe there is no

18

basis for the plaintiffs to seek that kind of

19

incremental relief when they've acknowledged that will

20

have no material effect on their injury; and they

21

acknowledged that in the State's complaint when they

22

specifically said that the relief they seek here would

23

only constitute these defendants' share of the larger

24

overall emissions reductions that would be necessary in

25

order to have any material effect on climate change or
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the injuries that they assert.

2

acknowledgment that the relief they seek here would not

3

provide them any redress except in connection with other

4

reductions that would be obtained elsewhere, and that we

5

think means that this is a classic case in which the

6

injuries are not the product of the defendants' conduct

7

but of the collective independent actions of numerous

8

third parties not before the Court.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That is an

But the Court clearly

10

understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it

11

was enough, and I would think under traditional standing

12

principles the standing there was actually harder to

13

find because one had to go through the EPA first.

14

had to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA

15

would regulate, and then the question was would that

16

reduce emissions levels?

17

picture.

One

Here the EPA is out of the

The action is much more direct.

18

MR. KEISLER:

But there, Your Honor, they

19

were suing a defendant, the EPA, that had regulatory

20

authority over the entire country.

21

five separate defendants, each of whom has to be

22

evaluated individually, and there is not a single one of

23

them against whom the relief sought would have any

24

tangible effect on the injuries that the plaintiffs

25

claim here.

Here they're suing

But we also think that Massachusetts is
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

relevant in a completely different respect, which is the

2

Court was very specific in Massachusetts about what its

3

role was and what it wasn't.

4

the expertise or the authority to second-guess the

5

policy choices of the EPA, but its role there was to

6

compel the agency to adhere to the statute as the Court

7

interpreted it.

8
9

The Court said:

We lack

In this case, the States are asking the
courts to play exactly the role that this Court

10

disclaimed in Massachusetts v. EPA, which is to make

11

those policy choices in the first instance, and they say

12

that the courts can do this because the courts have done

13

this in prior nuisance cases, but this case is nothing

14

like any of the prior nuisance cases this Court has

15

held.

16

is complaining that another State has dumped sewage into

17

a body of water that's crossed the border.

18

It's nothing like an instance in which one State

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The case -­

So how many States

19

does it take?

20

who have made that allegation, I don't know exactly how

21

you draw the line between a case like Tennessee Copper

22

and this case.

23

I think, you know, if it's three States

MR. KEISLER:

It's not a question of the

24

quantity of plaintiffs, Mr. Chief Justice, it's the

25

nature of the task that the Court would have to perform,
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and this task is different because of the global nature

2

of the phenomenon.

3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm more receptive to this

4

kind of argument if I know we're going to the merits as

5

opposed to standing -­

6

MR. KEISLER:

It -- it -­

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

-- and I recognize that we

8

slip in and out of the two categories, and don't want to

9

make it difficult on you.

But I take it that these

10

arguments also go to whether there's a cause of action

11

on the merits.

12

MR. KEISLER:

Exactly, Your Honor, and

13

whether the Court should expand the Federal common law

14

to recognize this.

15

makes it different because every sector of the economy

16

worldwide produces greenhouse gases, and there is no

17

geographic nexus, as there was in Tennessee Copper and

18

every one of the other nuisance cases, between the

19

source of the emission and the victim that claims the

20

harm.

21

means that any court or policymaker thinking about how

22

to alleviate the kinds of injuries that are pled here

23

has to first think what is the appropriate overall level

24

of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and then

25

make a comparative judgment about how the reductions

And that changes what the Court has to do.

11
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that would be necessary to achieve that level should be

2

allocated among all the different sectors based on the

3

social good that that sector produces and what

4

reductions would mean to that social good.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought your -- your

6

first argument when you addressed this issue was there

7

is a decisionmaker and that decisionmaker is EPA.

8

you wouldn't get to even how arduous a task this would

9

be if it was within the court's bailiwick.

So

I thought

10

your position was that the function, this regulatory

11

function, has been assigned to the EPA and not to the

12

courts.

13

MR. KEISLER:

We are making both arguments,

14

Justice Ginsburg.

We don't think there would be an

15

appropriate Federal common law cause of action even if

16

the Clean Air Act hadn't been enacted.

17

the argument is even stronger and easier because of the

18

existence of the Clean Air Act and in particular because

19

this Court in Massachusetts v. EPA interpreted the Clean

20

Air Act so that the term "pollutant" specifically

21

includes greenhouse gases, and that means that Congress

22

has assigned to EPA the task of making precisely the

23

determinations that plaintiffs ask the courts to make

24

here:

25

so, what regulatory consequence -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, the EPA is given

2

authority to regulate other pollutants, including those

3

that do not go up into the atmosphere, but that does not

4

prevent California, for example, from enacting stricter

5

standards for its -- for automobiles in its State.

6

MR. KEISLER:

Oh, and -­

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So why should we say the

8

EPA preempts the Federal common law?

9

MR. KEISLER:

Because this issue, and I

10

would prefer to refer to it as displacement rather than

11

preemption, is very different from the question of

12

preemption of State law.

13

savings clause that preserves State authority across a

14

variety of areas, but the Court in second Milwaukee v.

15

Illinois cases specifically distinguished between

16

displacement of State law and displacement of Federal

17

common law.

18

preemption of State law because of various concepts of

19

State sovereignty, but because of Federal concepts of

20

separation of powers, the presumption is in favor of

21

lawmaking by Congress and not lawmaking by courts, and

22

that means that the standard is very different.

23

means that if Congress has addressed the problem, then

24

Federal common law is displaced.

MR. KEISLER:

Milwaukee v Illinois II.

That

was the case in which the Court held that the Clean

Water Act displaced a Federal common law nuisance claim

by Illinois against Milwaukee and specifically said

5

because Congress had addressed the problem, Federal

common law had no role to play.

Here Congress has

EPA decisions that they oppose, and it would be

11

completely inconsistent with that process if they could

also take a complete end run around it and go to court

13

and ask courts to make the decisions that Congress has

14

assigned to EPA.

15
16
17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

This is a merits argument,

right?
MR. KEISLER:

Yes, it is a merits argument,

because it says that any Federal common law action would

be displaced by the Clean Air Act.

Now, the -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is the consequence of that

argument, Mr. Keisler, that there in fact is no Federal

common law of interstate pollution claims?

25

MR. KEISLER:

I don't think there is very

much left of any Federal common law of interstate
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pollution claims, just because the field has been so

2

heavily occupied by statutes.

3

nuisance cases that the court of appeals relied on, Your

4

Honor, they were in a completely different time.

5

were at a time when the Court's view of its common law

authority was extremely broad and its view of Congress's

7

constitutional power under the Commerce Clause was very

8

narrow.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You're confident you can establish not only

14

MR. KEISLER:

It will ultimately depend on

the state of the law at the time that such a

16

hypothetical case is filed, but we would welcome the

opportunity, Your Honor.

18

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is part of the inquiry,

19

part of the dynamic, how imminent the Federal regulation

20

is?

21

MR. KEISLER:

I don't think so, Justice

22

Kennedy.

I think the question is always what Congress

23

has done, not what the stage of the EPA rulemaking

24

process is.

25

destroy causes of action, and that's why the Court said

Congress, not EPA, can create or modify or

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in that Milwaukee 2 case that when Congress has

2

addressed the problem that's the end of the inquiry.

3

And there is no question that Congress has addressed not

4

just the general problem, but the specific problem here.

5

It has the statute which assigns EPA the authority to

6

regulate pollutants in certain ways and pollutants have

7

been defined under Massachusetts v. EPA to include the

8

precise greenhouse gasses that are at issue here.

9

There couldn't be a more specific example of

10

Congress having addressed the problem and assigned a

11

different approach to dealing with it than letting the

12

courts work it out under Federal common law.

13

The States' and the private plaintiffs'

argument is that the Federal common law will only be

displaced when EPA adopts the precise regulation that

provides the precise form of relief that they're asking

what the prudential standing doctrine is all about in,

for example, Newdow has said the following at page 11:

13

"Without prudential standing limitations, the Court

14

would be called upon to decide abstract questions of why

institutions may be more competent to address the

unnecessary to protect individual rights.

it goes to and that's Article III standing.

GENERAL KATYAL:

think that this case is best like Newdow, in which the

Court went to prudential standing first before Article

Massachusetts v. EPA, in analyzing the redressability

5

prong of what you're asking said that the reductions

6

that were sought there, if granted, would, quote, "slow

or reduce the problem."

And the reason for that is because this court in

as involving generalized grievance, I thought that the

19

generalized grievance was Article III.

20

what Mrs. Frothingham's case was about; it was a

21

grievance that she shared with everybody in the

22

populations, so she didn't have standing.

23

GENERAL KATYAL:

So it seems to me it's

I thought that's

Justice Ginsburg, we're not

any case that this Court has decided.

2

in the 222 years that announces the precise rule we're

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There is no case

But it seems, General

7

Katyal, that there also is no case where we've ever used

8

this language of generalized grievance as a prudential

9

matter rather than as an Article III matter.

10

So am I

wrong about that?

11

GENERAL KATYAL:

Well, I think that this

12

Court has in Newdow and in Warth v. Seldin used the

13

language of generalized grievances to reflect prudential

14

considerations.

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But Newdow -- Newdow quoted

16

the language of generalized grievance that came from

17

Warth, but it didn't specifically pin anything on that

18

language.

19

GENERAL KATYAL:

I quite agree with you,

Justice Kagan.

22

requires the Court to, for example, call into question

think that the prudential standing doctrine, at least in

2

a circumstance like this, which is a Federal common law

3

cause of action in which the Court is already being

4

asked to fashion the rules and, as Justice Scalia says,

5

an equitable action in which the Court has I think

6

special abilities to fashion relief if appropriate and

7

not -- I think prudential standing reflects best the

8

kind of tapestry of different factors.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, General Katyal, how

10

about the Aiken case, because in the Aiken case I think

11

the government came in and made the same argument, that

12

even though the injury was concrete, it was too

13

generalized and therefore there should be no standing,

14

the Court specifically rejected that argument both as to

15

Article III and as to prudential standing.

16

GENERAL KATYAL:

Right, and I think Aiken

17

says that the prudential standing cases thus far have

18

been about has concrete injury been shown to a

19

particular person.

20

purposes of Article III concrete injury has been shown

21

to at least one plaintiff, but we think that -­

22

And we're not disputing that for

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

To that extent you

23

disagree with Mr. Keisler because he says there is no

24

Article III?

25

GENERAL KATYAL:

That is absolutely correct,

21
Alderson Reporting Company

we do disagree to that extent.

2

standing best reflects the Court's general intuition in

3

this area that when a problem is of this magnitude and

literally involving the world, where everyone is a

potential perpetrator, everyone is a potential victim,

and where their own theory at page 15 of their brief and

can be cut down to judicially manageable standards.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'll give that you

23

on the zone of interests, but there you're dealing with

administrative law and a very narrow proposition.

think it's Justice Kennedy's point, or at least the

point of his questions, that these issues meld into the

2

merits and, at least for anyone who is troubled by the

3

idea that we are not going to decide a case even though

4

we have jurisdiction to decide it, maybe that's the

5

better place to address it.

6

GENERAL KATYAL:

I'll move to that and take

7

your invitation, Mr. Chief Justice.

But before doing

8

so, I would say that if you're going to give me

9

administrative law and zone of interest I think you

10

should then give me Federal common law, which this Court

11

is at its height in terms of fashioning who can come

12

into court and what those rules may be.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand why you

14

assert that the remedy here will not provide the

15

relief -- you acknowledge that, don't you, that the

16

remedy here cannot possibly stop global warming, right?

17

GENERAL KATYAL:

We acknowledge that the

relief that they are seeking looks like the relief in

that the EPA had decided not to issue the endangerment

finding.

16

Would your argument still apply?
GENERAL KATYAL:

I think that that would

present a difficult case, because it would be the one

18

like the Petitioners make, which is the Clean Air Act

alone.

is at page 107 of the opinion:

that both together presents the best and easiest case

But if I insisted you answer

the hypothetical I gave you, what would the answer be?

No endangerment finding.

Is there displacement?

GENERAL KATYAL:

I think that it's a -- it's

a difficult case to make for -- for displacement, but I

10

think it could be made, for the reasons Mr. Keisler

11

suggests.

12

But I -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why is it -- I don't

it that much more difficult?

16

fact that EPA has the authority to regulate in a

17

particular area means that the ball has passed from the

18

courts to the agency, to the executive branch, and

19

they've made an implicit decision not to regulate a

20

particular question.

21

GENERAL KATYAL:

It's just -- I mean, it's

Absolutely.

The

there's a good argument to be made.

argument on the other side that you'll hear in a moment

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I guess that would

3

be a preemption question rather than -- rather than a

4

displacement question.

5

GENERAL KATYAL:

I think that very well may

6

be.

And with respect to that, Mr. Chief Justice, you

7

had asked before about State common law causes of action

8

and whether they would be -- they would kind -- the

9

existence of those would somehow mean that the Court

10

should either find jurisdiction or reach the merits in a

11

way.

12

the Court from -- from -- from recognizing a Federal

13

common law cause of action for displacement very well

14

may be preemption questions as well that could be

addressed down the road with respect to State common law

JUSTICE ALITO:

I understand that that's not

2

the issue here, but does the government have a position

3

on that if -- if New York law provides exactly the same

4

public nuisance claim that is now asserted under Federal

5

common law, would that be consistent?

6

GENERAL KATYAL:

I -- I don't think we have

7

a position at this time on that.

That's I think an

8

enormously complicated question we can get to at an

9

appropriate time.

Our central -- our central submission

10

to you on displacement is this:

11

no precedent for the argument that they are making here,

12

which is that the Federal Government has to regulate the

13

precise jot and tittle, the specific relief that they

14

are seeking before displacement occurs.

Well, we think, again, the

20

Court doesn't need to get into that question because

21

it -- you know, the -- there are few Federal common law

causes of action in the area of nuisance -- I mean, and

So, if there were -- if

there were no Clean Air Act, you would still say that

this suit, a suit like this, would -- would fail

14

prudential standing, but you don't have a position as to

15

whether there would be a claim under Federal common law?

16

GENERAL KATYAL:

That is correct.

We think

17

it would still fail prudential standing because of the

18

quantity and quality of the nature of the problem here,

19

and the multitude of different policy judgments that

20

would be required -- that this Court would be required

21

to undertake to adjudicate a Federal common law cause of

22

action in the absence of a statute.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I'm sorry, General,

24

because I was understanding your answer differently, and

25

maybe I misheard you, as saying that if there were no

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, but as to whether the

cause of action exists under Federal common law in a

case like this, where you said it was so different from

GENERAL KATYAL:

Then I think that again for

purposes of State common law, I think this Court would

10

approach that question the same way it did in Milwaukee

11

II, which is to say that's a really separate

12

policy-based question that the Court doesn't use to

13

answer the questions about whether a cause of action

14

should be recognized or whether displacement has

15

occurred.

They are seeking standards

I asked Mr. Keisler, and do you

Does EPA, could EPA, regulate and set

GENERAL KATYAL:

Absolutely, Justice

10

Ginsburg.

11

is, EPA is currently regulating existing sources.

12

the extent that a power plant is modified in any way to

13

increase carbon dioxide above a certain amount -- and

14

this is one of the so-called tailoring rules -- then

15

those power plants right now are subject to regulation.

16

Indeed, one has already had to get a permit.

17

regulations just went into effect in January 2011 for

18

existing power plants that seek to modify.

19

Let me say three things about that.

First
To

These

Second, there is a settlement agreement in

20

place that commits EPA by May of 2012 to deciding how

21

and whether to regulate existing power sources, the

22

existing stationary sources.

23

And third, and I think most fundamentally,

24

there is no precedent, Justice Ginsburg, that says that

25

the government must regulate the specific industry, the
33

specific thing that the plaintiff isolates, in order for

displacement to occur.

government's highest priorities -- and concrete steps

And so long as the nuisance is being

taken, such as the 500-page tailoring rule, the

11

400-page -- the -- the other hundreds of pages that EPA

has done with its experts to appropriately regulate

13

greenhouse gas emissions, as opposed to a Federal common

put you all at sea in terms of the complexity,

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, could I take you

18

back on that last point to another threshold question,

19

which is the political question doctrine?

20

of your arguments really sound like prongs two and three

21

from Baker v. Carr, but you say that we shouldn't go

there, that we should instead address this matter on

prudential standing grounds.

doctrine actually seems more natural, given the kinds of

way.

I think either is an appropriate

5

(Laughter.)

6

GENERAL KATYAL:

But I think that the

7

prudential standing doctrine is a bit narrower because

8

it -- it contemplates a variety of factors, including

9

the fact that this is a Federal common law cause of

10

action where the Court is fashioning relief in the first

11

place, as opposed to the political question doctrine

12

which looks -- looks more to the standardless nature of

13

the adjudication.

14

We agree that -- that the political question

15

doctrine is an appropriate way to dismiss of this case,

16

but we think that, like Newdow, like Kowalski, this

17

Court can handle this case on prudential standing first

18

and recognize that this is an unprecedented action

19

involving literally the world, and it is not suited for

20

judicial resolution, and that flows quite naturally from

21

the precepts of the prudential standing doctrine.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not an area where

23

the Court can't go.

To take a political question we all

24

agree on, I think, the courts can't mess with the

25

impeachment of a president, just -- but here the Court

fundamental authority of the States to protect their

land, their natural resources, and their citizens from

air pollution emitted in other States.

18

three propositions:

19

are harmed by global warming; two, these defendants, as

20

the five largest U.S. emitters of carbon dioxide, are

21

significant contributors to it; and, three, these

22

defendants could take reasonable, cost-effective

23

measures to reduce their emissions in a way that would

24

slow the effects of global warming.

25

It rests on

One, the interests of the States

public nuisance has been around for hundreds of years,

12

adjudication of this case will require courts to solve

13

the entire problem of global warming, but that is simply

14

not so.

15

On the plaintiffs' side, this is about the

16

States.

17

that has been traditionally recognized by this Court;

18

their lands, their citizens, their businesses are being

19

injured by pollution emitted in other States.

20

We are alleging the kind of injury to States

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

General Underwood, the -­

21

the relief that you're seeking, asking a court to set

22

standards for emissions, sounds like the kind of thing

23

that EPA does.

24

promulgate standards for emissions, and now what -- the

25

relief you're seeking seems to me to set up a district

I mean, Congress set up the EPA to

37
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

judge, who does not have the resources, the expertise,

2

as a kind of super EPA.

3

MS. UNDERWOOD:

It's not as a super EPA.

4

It's something much smaller.

5

Interstate pollution disputes have historically been

6

entrusted to the courts, including the determination of

7

how much is unreasonable, which is -­

8
9

It's a different question.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if we just

concentrate on I think the relief you want, you say:

10

District court, if we pass everything else, you set

11

emissions standards, you put a cap immediately, you set

12

a cap, and then annually you require further reductions.

13

Well, that just sounds to me like what EPA does when it

14

sets emission standards.

15

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, it's also like what

16

the Court did in Tennessee Copper.

17

case doesn't ask the Court to decide how much, contrary

18

to what Petitioners suggest, to decide how much emission

19

reduction is required to solve the whole problem of

20

global warming and then allocate a portion to these

21

defendants.

22

and that is to decide whether these defendants can take

23

reasonable cost-effective measures that would help to

24

slow the pace of global warming.

25

That is to say, this

It asks the Court to do something simpler,

JUSTICE ALITO:

So -­

How does a district judge

38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decide what is reasonable and cost-effective?

There are

2

considerations -- this is not a situation in which the

3

emission of greenhouse gases can be totally prohibited.

4

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Correct.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

There are other -- there are

6

countervailing interests.

7

can a district court balance those interests?

8
9

So how does the court -- how

MS. UNDERWOOD:
about that.

Well, I would say two things

One, it was also true in Tennessee Copper

10

that it was not the case that the sulfur emissions could

11

be eliminated or that the plant was to be put out of

12

business.

13

sulfur, a quite specific reduction of sulfur emissions

14

in one season and more in another season.

15

does -­

16

The Court in that case ordered a reduction of

JUSTICE ALITO:

And how

But do you seriously argue

17

this isn't -- this isn't orders of magnitude more

18

complicated than that case?

19

MS. UNDERWOOD:

It's somewhat more -- it's

20

larger.

21

a court would do that is presumably the way it did it in

22

Tennessee Copper.

23

testimony, there could also be evidence about whether -­

24

what other emitters are doing, what they do that is

25

feasible and cost-effective to reduce their emissions.

I don't know if it's more complicated.

The way

That is, there could be expert

39
Alderson Reporting Company

In Tennessee Copper, one of the defendants settled, and

2

the other was subject to an order, and it would have

3

been available to the Court to look to what the settling

4

defendant did for some indication of what the

5

nonsettling defendant might well be ordered to do.

6

there is evidence available from which a court could

7

conclude what is reasonable.

8
9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what is the

-- what factors go into the cost-benefit analysis that

10

would have to be undertaken to decide what level of

11

emissions are reasonable in light of the threat of

12

global -- global warming?

13
14
15

So

MS. UNDERWOOD:

The available technology,

the cost of that technology -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Obviously the

16

greatest benefit to reduce global warming would be, of

17

course, to shut down the power plants, right?

18

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, we haven't asked for

19

that and nobody suggests that that would be appropriate.

20

It's not, any more than it was in Tennessee Copper.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Because -- right.

22

But I mean, across the economy, the whole problem of

23

dealing with global warming is that there are costs and

24

benefits on both sides, and you have to determine how

25

much you want to readjust the world economy to address

1

global warming, and I think that's a pretty big burden

2

to post -- to impose on a district court judge.

3

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, it's also a burden

4

that the plaintiffs would have to bear.

That is to say,

5

we have alleged, and are entitled to try to prove -- and

6

we might fail; that would be for the district judge to

7

determine -- that "the defendants have available to them

8

practical, feasible" -- I'm reading from the

9

complaint -- "and economically viable options for

10

reducing carbon dioxide emissions without significantly

11

increasing the cost of electricity to their customers,

And even if

Can the courts set a tax?
The agency -- the agency

8

is engaged in that, in it right now, and that's another

9

facet of this case, the potential for conflict.

The

10

EPA, after acting for a while, has now agreed that it

11

does have authority to classify this as a pollutant and

12

it has taken the first steps.

13

One argument that the EPA -- that the United

14

States is presenting is the way agencies go about this

15

is incrementally, so they're starting with motor

16

vehicles and then maybe they will go to new sources, and

17

then they'll get to maybe where you are.

18

the Court to start with the existing sources, to set

19

limits that may be in conflict with what an existing

20

agency is doing.

23

But you want

Do we ignore the fact that the EPA is there
and that it is regulating in this area?
MS. UNDERWOOD:

No, we do not ignore that.

24

This is a very peculiar moment in time for this case to

25

arrive in this Court, because what is offered as
43
Alderson Reporting Company

1

displacing is something that is said to be imminent, not

2

something that actually exists, and something that is

3

imminent may never happen.

4

reason that I believe the United States suggested a GBR

5

and we suggested that the case be dismissed so that the

6

lower courts could deal with the unfolding events as

7

they occur.

8
9

It was, of course, for that

But the case is here now, and there is no
Federal statute or regulation that currently regulates

10

the emission of greenhouse gases by existing unmodified

11

power plants, like the ones operated by the defendants.

12

And the Clean Air Act works very differently from the

13

Clean Water Act.

14

system for all emissions when it was enacted in 1970.

15

Unlike the Clean Water Act 2 years later, which forbids

16

all discharges until they're authorized by permit, the

17

Clean Air Act doesn't regulate anything until the EPA

18

makes findings and imposes restrictions.

19

It did not put in place a permit

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I suppose there

20

were reasons that Congress adopted that approach, and

21

your suit would override those determinations.

22

MS. UNDERWOOD:

No, our suit is consistent

23

with those determinations.

That is to say, the design

24

of the statute leaves preexisting law in place until EPA

25

steps in.

If the Clean Air Act were thought to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How much -- how much

regulation do you need before you would admit that there

is displacement?

9

that you're adopting or a displacement analysis?

10

Is it -- is it a preemption analysis

MS. UNDERWOOD:

It's a displacement

11

analysis.

12

What -- what we start from is that the States have a

13

historic right to go to court under the Federal common

14

law and that to -- to -- to deal with the problem of

15

interstate pollution, and that that was a promise that

16

they obtained, the Federal remedy, in exchange for the

17

surrender of sovereignty in joining the Union.

18

has to be -- there's a strong Federal interest in there

19

being a Federal remedy.

20

I believe it's a displacement analysis.

So there

Now, when the Clean Air Act was -- was

21

passed, without any regulations, if it displaced the

Federal common law, there would be no Federal law

applicable at all, because the Federal common law would

In what way is that different

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Well, the difference isn't

on that front.

The difference is that with respect to

preemption Congress has to decide that it does -- that

we're talking about is simply whether Congress or the

agency has acted.

for the reason it survived Erie was the Court spoke of

the strong Federal interest in providing the States with

I don't think the

And of course it's true that

12

if you conclude that the Federal statutes displace the

13

Federal -- and the Federal regulations displace the

14

Federal common law either now or in the future, then

15

under Ouellette, the same Federal statute that replaces

16

Federal common law will revive source State common law,

17

because of the savings clause in that statute, because

18

of a choice Congress made; and that result, while less

-- less respectful of the Federal interest in providing

20

Federal law to govern these disputes, would nevertheless

21

leave common law courts in the business that they're -­

22

of attempting to address pollution problems.

23

The suggestion has been made that the EPA

It only seems like

obstacle is removed, there still remain a series of

programs under the statute, a series of kinds of sources

that need to be regulated.

10

Once that

It may well be that there will be a

11

regulation soon that displaces, but it would be very

12

surprising if this Court concluded that the promise of

13

regulation is enough to displace the Federal common law

14

as distinguished from the actuality of it.

15

The Court has suggested that a court might

16

impose standards that would conflict with what the EPA

17

is doing, but there's really no reason to think that

18

would happen because if what a court sets out to do is

19

find out what feasible methods there are for reduction

20

and then order the defendants to make reductions that

21

are feasible, that's a much less taxing inquiry, a much

less demanding inquiry than the EPA is likely ultimately

to make.

MS. UNDERWOOD:

judgment to comply with regulations, should that happen.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what appellate courts

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I guess, just

21

to follow up, what is the appellate court reviewing?

22

it reviewing the reasonableness of EPA's judgment or the

23

continuing validity of the injunction it entered

24

previously?

25

MS. UNDERWOOD:

The continuing validity of

Is

the injunction it entered previously because once the

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But that seems to be

4

a displacement of the normal process of administrative

5

law, which we would review the agency's determination of

6

how best and to what extent to regulate the emissions.

7

MS. UNDERWOOD:

On a different litigation

8

track, it is -- would also be possible to challenge the

9

EPA's regulatory judgment, but in the case in which a

10

judgment had already been entered, it is the ordinary

11

litigation track to, if -- if intervening events make

12

equitable relief no longer equitable, to go back to the

13

court and ask the court to modify its injunction.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

And I guess

15

that's the central problem.

16

litigation, it's an entirely different set of standards

17

that would regulate emissions as opposed to the

18

standards that would apply with respect to an agency's

19

determination.

20

MS. UNDERWOOD:

Once you turn it over to

I don't think it's a

21

different set -- yes, one set of standards for reviewing

22

an agency's determination, but the ultimate standards

23

that are reached are going to be a level of emission

24

reduction through either process.

25

When the agency speaks to the question, the
66

Federal common law is displaced.

during what could be a long period of time when it

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KEISLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Just a few points.
First, with respect to the merits and what

17

it would involve to adjudicate this case, Justice Kagan,

18

it is a -- there's a reason that this issue is so

19

fraught and difficult in international negotiations and

20

at the EPA and in the halls of Congress, and that's

21

because it requires policymakers to allocate burdens

22

among critical social goods in favor of important

23

environmental considerations; and the remedies that are

24

being considered are potentially transformative because

25

they involve the way we use and supply and pay for

7

risks and benefits against the projected economic

8

benefits and costs.

9

And the problems with courts attempting to

It's a question of trade-offs, how the

12

the judiciary.

13

in a big intractable issue like this, Congress can often

14

create an orderly framework for consideration within a

15

statutory context, which it has done in part by enacting

16

the Clean Air Act.

It's not that this is permanently off limits to
It's that it requires a standard.

And

17

And the final point I would make my friend

18

and I come at this really from opposite angles, in the

19

following sense, which is the plaintiffs say that this

20

is a deeply historically rooted cause of action with a

21

very strong and ancient pedigree, and therefore it can't

22

possibly present justiciability problems, under

23

standing, political question doctrines; and we say that

24

the very powerful standing and political question

25

obstacles that we think are apparent on the face of this
68
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

are a signal that this is nothing like the historical

2

cause of action that they've relied on.

3

To classify climate change as a tort would

4

trigger a massive shift of institutional authority away

5

from the politically accountable branches and to the

6

courts, which we think would be inconsistent with

7

separation of powers, and for those reasons we ask that

8

the Court reverse the judgment and direct that the case

be dismissed.
