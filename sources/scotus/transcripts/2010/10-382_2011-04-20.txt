ORAL ARGUMENT OF PRATIK A. SHAH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. SHAH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

Relying on common law trust principles

12

applicable to private fiduciaries, the Federal Circuit

13

imposed on the United States a duty to disclose

14

attorney-client privileged communications to an Indian

15

tribe.

16

reversed for at least three reasons.

17

That abrogation of the privilege should be

First, reflecting the sovereign nature of

18

the United States function, the Indian trust context

19

lacks the factors essential to recognition of a private

20

trust fiduciary exception.

21

government attorneys and other Federal officials owe an

22

exclusive duty of loyalty to the United States, not to

23

the beneficiary.

24

administration out of appropriated funds, not out of the

25

trust corpus.

Unlike in a private trust,

The government pays the cost of trust

The government, not the trust, owns the
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

resulting record, and the release of such governmental

2

record, including to a tribe or individual Indian, is

3

governed by specific statutes and regulations as well as

4

the Freedom of Information Act, not the common law.

5

Second, the decision below conflicts with

6

this Court's precedents that distinguish the United

7

States from a private trustee and that reject

8

enforcement of duties governing the administration of

9

Indian property that are not set forth by specific

10
11

statute or regulation.
The fiduciary exception to the

12

attorney-client privilege is premised on a private

13

trustee's general common law duty to disclose trust

14

information, but no statute or regulation imposes such a

15

duty on the United States.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, all of the

17

statutes relating to these funds use the word "trust."

18

Not one statute defines trust and says in any way this

19

is not a fiduciary relationship.

20

fact, most of the statutes require what would be

21

consistent with fiduciary obligations, and at least one

22

of them that you rely on says "but not limited to."

23

To the contrary, in

So the issue before us doesn't involve a

24

competing sovereign interest by the U.S.

sovereign issue governing the U.S. activities.

explain to me what's the rationale that would permit a

4

trustee of a trust fund to withhold from the beneficiary

the kinds of documents that relate to the management of

the fund?

MR. SHAH:

Okay -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's the part that

doesn't make -- that you're not explaining.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shah, you might want

13

to make your third point.

You said you had three points

14

preliminarily, so why don't you make your third point

15

and then respond to the question.

16

MR. SHAH:

Sure, Your Honor.

The third

17

point is that the Federal Circuit's decision poses

18

serious practical problems for the government because

19

the general common law duty to disclose which undergirds

20

the fiduciary exception extends to all trust information

21

without regard to the existence of litigation; excepting

22

it implies a broad and burdensome disclosure obligation.

23

For example, there are over 300,000 individual account

24

holders, individual Indian account holders on top of the

25

tribal, tribal account holders.

If this Court were to

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

accept the fiduciary exception and thereby ratify the

2

underlying rationale, presumably then any one of those

3

or all of those 300-plus thousand individual account

4

holders could simply call up the Interior Department and

5

request all related trust records outside of the

6

existing statutory and regulatory regime.

7

Now, Justice Sotomayor, let me turn back to

8

your set of questions, and let me start with the first

9

point that you made, which is the statutes here use the

10

term trust; why doesn't that connote some sort of broad

11

fiduciary relationship?

12

its precedents, and it dates back to the Mitchell 1, the

13

first decision in Mitchell case, where Congress's use of

14

the term "trust," the Court said, does not imply the

15

full gamut of common law fiduciary obligations.

16

This Court has made clear in

The dissent made precisely -- the dissent in

17

Mitchell made precisely the argument that you're

18

sketching out here, which is when Congress uses a term

19

like trust, we would naturally assume that it implies

20

fiduciary obligations.

21

rejected that notion, and in fact in Mitchell 2 in the

22

Navajo Nation decisions, the Court has continued to

23

reject that proposition.

24

matter of precedent I think that makes -­

25

The majority in Mitchell

But more -- more than as a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But in both -- in all of

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

those cases, counsel, it was a limitation related to

2

competing interests, meaning it was recognizing that

3

there are potentially moments in which an attorney is

4

acting both in the interest of the government and in the

5

interest of the tribe.

6

MR. SHAH:

Justice Sotomayor, with respect,

7

there is no competing interest that I'm aware of that

8

were mentioned in -- in the Mitchell decisions, Mitchell

9

1, Mitchell 2, or even the Navajo Nation decision.

10

Those were simply -- in Mitchell 1 it was the Indian

11

General Allotment Act, which said that the United States

12

"shall hold in trust" land for the benefit of the

13

Indians.

14

and by the dissenters in the Court was when the Court

15

said you shall hold the land in trust, that implies

16

certain management and other responsibilities for

17

resources related to that land.

18

when Congress uses the term "trust" in the Indian

19

context, that there must be specific statutory

20

regulatory duties that the Court sets out.

21

explain -­

22

The argument made by the tribe in that case

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This Court said no,

Let me

But that was a

23

jurisdictional question, not a question with respect

24

to -- to the -- to the obligation.

25

suggesting that if you're a trustee of an Indian fund
7
Alderson Reporting Company

You're not seriously

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that you can breach your fiduciary duty by simply not

2

exercising care in your investment strategies.

3

form of -- of duty exists.

4

MR. SHAH:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

So some

Sure, and let me -­
-- from the common law,

and the common law has to define that.

7

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, I agree

8

everything up to the point when you said we go to the

9

common law.

Of course there would be in this context

10

some enforceable duties with respect to investment of

11

the funds held in trust, and that's because the relevant

12

statutes, section 161a and 162a, set forth specific

13

investment duties that the government must comply with.

14

Now, as to your other point, that Mitchell 1 and the

15

Navajo Nation -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so why would, if it

17

imposes those duties, protect you from disclosing items

18

that might -- attorney confidences that go to that very

19

act, the very act of investing in the way, even under

20

your definition, that the trust requires you to?

21

MR. SHAH:

A couple responses, Your Honor.

22

The -- the two statutes that you're talking about, 161a

23

and 162a, set forth specific investment duties.

24

don't say anything about disclosure.

25

set forth some disclosure obligations, but they are
8
Alderson Reporting Company

They

The 1994 Act does

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

extremely discrete.

2

disclosure obligations that all of these statutes

3

together impose.

4

an account statement, a quarterly account statement; and

5

the United States must provide the -- the Indian tribes

6

and individual Indians an annual audit.

7

extent of disclosure obligations that Congress has set

8

forth and that the Interior Department by regulation has

9

implemented.

10

There are essentially two

The -- the United States must provide

That is the

Now, to the -- to the extent that your

11

question suggests that the tribes may need more in order

12

to enforce those enforcement duties, I think the -- the

13

account statements and the annual audit goes a long way

14

towards suggesting that if there is a problem, then the

15

tribe may want to try to enforce those duties.

16

The other point I would make is, although

17

the legally enforceable duties under this Court's

18

decisions in Mitchell and Navajo Nation are those set

19

forth by statute and regulation, that doesn't mean the

20

Interior Department doesn't have discretion to provide

21

more information.

22

Interior Department does provide a much broader swath of

23

information to the Indian tribes regarding these

24

accounts than the two discrete pieces of information

25

that the statutes set forth.

And in fact, in practice, the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you agree that the -- do

2

you agree that the fiduciary exception is well

3

established as a general matter?

4

MR. SHAH:

Your Honor, the United States

5

does not contest the existence of a fiduciary exception

6

in certain private trust contexts where the criteria for

7

that exception are satisfied.

8

don't, we don't dispute the existence in certain

9

contexts under certain circumstances of a fiduciary

10

So the answer is no, we

exception.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

So if this cause arose in a

12

different context with a different trustee, the position

13

of the United States would be that under Rule 501 of the

14

Federal Rules of Evidence there is a fiduciary exception

15

to the attorney-client privilege?

16

MR. SHAH:

17

on the circumstances.

18

trust and the factors that -- in which the courts, the

19

old English cases, for example, have recognized where

20

the fiduciary exception applies, that is the information

21

is sought solely for the benefit of the beneficiary, the

22

expenses for that legal advice are paid out of the trust

23

corpus, and as a result of that, the resulting legal

24

advice and the resulting records belong to the trust

25

corpus.

Yes, Your Honor.

It would depend

For example, if it were a private

All of those things give right, as the old
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

English cases say, give right to a common law right of

2

access for the beneficiary to access those.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shah, you don't have

4

to take a position on that, because you don't represent

5

a private trustee.

6

arguendo that there would be such a relationship, but I

7

don't think you have to defend it.

8
9

And the government can accept

MR. SHAH:

Absolutely, the Court need not

decide that question in order to reach the question.

10

The Court can assume it arguendo and then go forward.

11

think the critical point here is, though, that all of

12

the factors that underlie that -- that exception in the

13

private trustee concept are absent here.

government is acting out of its own interest.

appropriations.

issue by virtue of the Federal Records Act, by virtue of

18

Interior Department regulations, which are cited in the

19

20

owns these records, and because they are governmental

21

records their disclosure is not governed by the common

22

law.

JUSTICE ALITO:

The thrust of what -- my

24

understanding of the thrust of what Justice Sotomayor

25

was asking is something like the following:
11
Alderson Reporting Company

It's easy

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to understand how there can be competing government

2

interests when you're talking about some, the management

3

of lands, things of that nature.

4

talking about managing funds, what competing interests

5

can there be in practical terms?

6

that this exception applies to a private trustee, why

7

should it not apply to the government in practical

8

terms?

9

MR. SHAH:

Sure.

But when you're just

If you assume arguendo

Let me provide two

10

responses, Justice Alito.

11

position I don't think our position turns, as a formal

12

matter, on the existence of a specific competing duty.

13

I think such a rule would overlook the ways in which the

14

U.S. inherently, United States inherently differs from a

15

private trustee.

16

the light of the complex multifaceted ways in which the

17

government interacts with Indians and Indian tribes.

18

Those sovereign obligations extend to law -- providing

19

law enforcement, educational duties, health services.

20

One subset of those duties are the type of trust

21

responsibilities at issue in this case.

22

First, I think as a formal

And I think that's especially true in

Now, to be more concrete, I think, even

23

putting aside that larger framework which may create

24

tensions between the United States and with -- and the

25

Indian tribes in certain circumstances, I think even in
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the trust fund, purely in the trust fund context that

2

we're talking about, there could be at least tensions

3

that arise.

4

For example, the D.C. Circuit in the Cobell

5

case when it talked about the accounting obligation that

6

it imposed on the government, it made clear that it's

7

not the same accounting obligation that would apply at

8

common law.

9

because the United States would be taking that -­

And the reason the D.C. Circuit gave was

10

performing that obligation at the expense of taxpayers.

11

There are budgetary constraints that the United States

12

must take into consideration as a sovereign.

13

that's not a specific competing obligation in the formal

14

sense, but I think it's -- it's a factor that

15

distinguishes the United States from a private

16

fiduciary.

17

Maybe

Also, there are -- for example in our brief

18

we discuss one of, just as an example, one of the

19

documents at issue in this case, which involves a

20

judgment by a tribal court seeking to attach funds from

21

an individual Indian money account.

22

acts as a trustee with respect to that individual -­

23

Indian account.

24

States consistent with its fiduciary obligations in that

25

sense could simply pay out the judgment, but I think

The United States

It may be the case that the United

closer look at the judgment, to make sure that it

19

MR. SHAH:

I think the response is, Your

20

Honor, is that the situation will never be identical to

21

the hypothetical you posed because the government

22

inherently differs, and let me set out -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But this argument,

24

frankly, would be -- we wouldn't have any need for 501,

25

because if as an evidentiary rule the government is
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

always different, then there is no situation in which

2

fiduciary duties in common law would ever exist.

3

MR. SHAH:

To be clear, Justice Sotomayor,

4

the government is not arguing that no common law

5

exception to the attorney-client privilege can apply to

6

the government or that Federal Rule 501, Federal Rule of

7

Evidence 501 is otherwise inapplicable.

8

much more limited argument that this particular common

9

law fiduciary exception is not applicable to the

We're making a

10

government, and that is because the premise of that

11

fiduciary exception does not apply.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is there -- is there any

13

greater value to a fiduciary duty than to manage the

14

account for the benefit of the beneficiary?

15

very essence of what a trust means, and so I'm having a

16

hard time understanding not a competing interest

17

situation where you're addressing a different statutory

18

requirement, but merely -- and that's what this case was

19

presented as, merely the management of the trust.

20

what you're, it seems to me, you're arguing is there is

21

no duty.

22

only, but you're rendering -- there's no need to use the

23

word "trust" because it wouldn't be a trust.

24
25

That's the

So

You're saying it's all defined by statute

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, I don't think

that those two things are inconsistent.
15
Alderson Reporting Company

The fact that

we don't look to the common law to fill in all of the

duties doesn't mean that the government doesn't have

duties in this context.

forth in the statutes.

create obligations on the government.

It has very specific duties, to

What this Court has said could

JUSTICE BREYER:

I would like to get an

answer to my question.

10

MR. SHAH:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sure.
My question, to go back to

12

it, was imagine that the government has a thousand trust

13

accounts for a thousand tribes.

14

MR. SHAH:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

Okay.
And imagine that several of

them consist of nothing more than $500,000 in cash.

17

MR. SHAH:

Okay.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

And one day the Secretary

19

of the Interior says to a lawyer:

I fear there is kind

20

of a difficult fiduciary problem arising into account

21

number 302, which is owned by such and such tribe.

22

There is no threat of litigation.

23

the answer to this will have no implication for anything

24

else in the government.

25

give me a memo what to do?

As far as I can tell,

Will you please look at it and

16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Now, why should that memo not be given to

2

the lawyer for the tribe if in the identical case of the

3

Union Trust Company you would give the lawyer -- the

4

memo to the beneficiary?

5

MR. SHAH:

A couple of reasons, Your Honor.

6

First, as this Court recognized, starting back in 1912

7

in the Heckman case, and reiterated in the Candelaria

8

and Minnesota cases after that, is that the United

9

States is not acting simply out of the beneficiary's

10
11

interests.
So in the hypothetical, the original

12

hypothetical that you posed in the corporation or the

13

bank that was acting as a trustee, there the trustee is

14

simply acting out of its fiduciary obligation solely to

15

benefit the beneficiary.

16

governments work.

17

government is acting not out of the beneficiary's

18

interests, it is acting out of its own sovereign

19

interest in managing the statutes and regulations that

20

govern the administration of Indian property.

21

fundamental difference.

22
23

That is not how the

As this Court made clear, the

JUSTICE BREYER:

You're saying, one, we're

not really a trustee totally?

24

MR. SHAH:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's a

Yes.
Okay.

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Now, if we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

treated -- the courts treated you as a trustee really

2

and totally -­

3

MR. SHAH:

Sure.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- in this very limited

5

situation I described, what harm would befall the

6

government?

7

MR. SHAH:

Well, Your Honor, we would still

8

win, and here's why.

The factors that -- even assuming

9

a common law trustee, the fiduciary exception doesn't

10

apply automatically at all common law trustees.

11

several things that underlie that fiduciary exception.

12

There's

One, the -- the -- the advice sought is

13

typically paid for out of the trust corpus, and as a

14

result of that fact, the trust itself owns the records.

15

Those are the principal two factors that the cases

16

recognizing a fiduciary exception rely upon to create a

17

common law right of access of the beneficiary to such

18

records.

19

None of those factors are present here.

20

government pays for these -- for -- for the cost of

21

administration, including legal advice, out of

22

congressionally appropriated funds.

23

resulting from that advice belonged to the government.

24

The government owns those records, both as a matter of

25

statute and regulation.

The records

And the disclosure of those
18

records is subject to a highly reticulated regime.

There are statutes, there is regulations, there is the

bypassed if this Court were to accept the fiduciary

5

exception in this context.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All of that would be

Mr. Shah -­
Other than the time and

8

expense of going through voluminous records, which is

9

obvious, is there any other harm to the government in

10

being required to show that there's a competing interest

11

that makes disclosure unnecessary or improper?

12

MR. SHAH:

Yes, Your Honor.

As I said to

13

Justice Alito, it may not always be that the government

14

can point to a specific competing interest in the sense

15

that Justice Sotomayor is talking about, a competing

16

statutory interest.

17

tensions, budgetary concerns, other ways in which the

18

United States interacts with Indian affairs.

19

But there are inherently these

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is one -- is one of them

20

there is a real chilling concern.

he refuses to turn over attorney advice, that there's

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And -- and so, once you

establish that this isn't the normal trust complex, we

apply the normal Rule 301 law, and -- and that does not

require the person who declines to turn over the

information to show why it would really hurt him to turn

those cases.

22

And -­

Let me get back to one of Justice

23

Sotomayor's questions, the -- the initial question about

24

the fact that the Congress has used the term "trust."

25

think as a matter of precedent, both the Mitchell
21
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

decisions and the Navajo Nation decisions, I think those

2

are binding, controlling precedent, and the Court should

3

not deviate from those precedents that say a statute or

4

regulation must define the duty.

5

nature of those precedents, I think they make sense from

6

first principles as well, and let me try to explain why.

7

The -- the -- the term "trust" has been used

But beyond the binding

8

by both Congress and the courts in a variety of ways,

9

often in a variety of imprecise ways, when it comes to

10

the relationship between the United States and Indians

11

and Indian tribes.

12

term when it comes to providing law enforcement, when it

13

comes to providing educational services, health

14

services, none of which are really the type of private

15

common law trust that we know.

16

Courts and Congress have used the

And even in scenarios where there is a

17

discrete property interest that might bring us closer to

18

the common law context, this Court has used -- this

19

Court and Congress has recognized that "trust" can mean

20

a lot of different things.

21

trust that was at issue in Mitchell 1, the Indian

22

General Allotment Act, when the trust was really simply

23

to avoid alienation of the land.

24

investment duties, as we have here.

25

It can mean the type of bare

It may mean specific

But the point is that there is no "one size
22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fits all" trust terminology, and so that's why it makes

2

sense for this Court to require Congress to set forth

3

the specific duties and statutes, and the Interior

4

Department to set forth specific duties and regulations

5

before it implies such a sweeping obligation on the

6

United States.

7

I think it also flows from a more general

8

principle of a reluctance to hold the United States to

9

common law duties when there's an existing statutory and

10

regulatory regime.

11

not only as a matter of precedent, but as -- as a matter

12

of principle, I think the -- the -- the fiduciary

13

exception would -- would not apply here.

14

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I think for all of those reasons,

I hadn't thought about

15

your argument until this -- until you made it this

16

morning, that if there -- if -- if the tribe is correct

17

that it owns these documents and gets -- can get them

18

19

the documents into five categories.

The Jicarilla Apache Nation has sued the

government for mismanaging millions of dollars of its

the government, is entitled to withhold the legal advice

that it has received about managing the beneficiary's

by Federal Rule 501, which specifies that Federal courts

the fact that the Uniform Trust Code reserves decision

to the attorney-client privilege?

well-established as you seem to argue.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, but, see, that's the

argument of the government, that the exception, the

22

trust exception to the extent that it exists, was based

23

principally upon the fact that these papers belonged to

24

the trust and that the attorney's advice had been paid

25

for by the trust, so of course the trustee is entitled

situation for the government to say that, while any

12

private fiduciary would be obliged to show to the

13

beneficiary the legal advice it's received when there's

14

an issue about whether it's fulfilled its fiduciary

15

duties, it's different because we've spent our

16

hard-earned money on these lawyers and we own the

17

records in issue.

And in that

I mean, that doesn't make sense.

18

And basically as a matter of discovery,

19

which is where we are right now, the posture of the

20

case, whenever you seek discovery, in virtually all of

21

those circumstances the documents in issue are going to

22

belong to the opposing party.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, the

24

attorney-client privilege is policy-based and I'm

25

concerned about the policy implications of your
28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

position.

Our system has concluded that it works best

2

if people have candid advice from their lawyers, and my

3

concern here is if you're a lawyer -- you are a lawyer

4

-- and -- and you're asked for your advice by a

5

trustee -­

6

MR. GORDON:

Right.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- and if you know

8

that that is going to be shared with the beneficiary,

9

you're going to give bland, mushy, hedging advice rather

10

than direct and candid advice to the trustee, because

11

it's going to be shared more widely beyond the trustee.

12

And that's -- that hurts not only the trustee, but also

13

the beneficiaries, whose trustee does not have candid

14

legal advice.

15

MR. GORDON:

My response to that would be

16

twofold, Your Honor.

17

argument can be made for any private fiduciary, yet the

18

courts have felt that the more important relationship is

19

the relationship between the trustee and the

20

beneficiary, that that trumps the need for or the

21

desirability for private discussions between the -­

22

appreciate the point, but how does a trustee get candid

legal advice?

I don't know if I have to do this or I have to

2

do this.

3

MR. GORDON:

Right.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it seems to me

5

if the -- if the information is always going to be

6

shared with the beneficiary, the trustee is always going

7

to get hedged advice.

8
9

MR. GORDON:

Well, if it's never shared,

Your Honor, then it leaves it at the option of the

10

trustee to selectively waive the privilege when it's to

11

its advantage in a breach of trust suit.

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No.

Why can't the trustee

13

say:

I'm going to hire my own lawyer?

14

pay this lawyer out of trust funds, so it will be my

15

lawyer, and his advice is only to me and serving my

16

interests?

17

I'm not going to

Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that suffice?
MR. GORDON:

I think the issue, Your Honor,

18

is whether that, in fact, is what the trustee is

seeking.

personal liability, then I certainly agree that the

21

trustee could do that.

seeking legal advice about how the trustee should manage

money belonging to the beneficiary -­

If the trustee is seeking advice about

3

So the distinction you draw doesn't seem to me to be a

4

workable one.

5

MR. GORDON:

If he messes up and doesn't

Well, Your Honor, I -- I submit

6

that the whole issue is if there is a suit for breach of

trust, which is the precondition for all of this,

whether in that circumstance the trustee is obliged to

produce the legal advice that it has received so the

10

beneficiary can be -­

11

JUSTICE SCALIA:

The trustee cannot hire his

12

own lawyer, you're saying.

13

he cannot hire his own lawyer to get advice on how to

14

manage the trust in a way that will avoid his liability.

15

He just can't do it, right?

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What's your best case that

21

you have on that in the private trustee context?

22

thought your answer was going to be that in that case,

23

the fact that the payment is made by the trustee out of

24

the trustee's own funds and not out of the trust funds

25

might be dispositive and might give him the privilege.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

I had

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But you -- you seem to say, in answer to the questions

2

from the Court, that, other than this distinction you

3

make between what the personal liability is and how he

4

ought to manage the trust, which I think is a murky

5

distinction, that the documents have to be disclosed.

6

What's your best case for that?

7

MR. GORDON:

Justice Kennedy, let me respond

8

to that.

And I agree that who is paying for it -- if

9

the trustee is paying for it out of his own or her own

10

pocket, that is a factor that certainly should be looked

11

at and would be entitled to -- to some weight in terms

12

of what the purpose of the advice was for; but

13

ultimately the issue is whether the trustee is seeking

14

to protect personal interests, protect against a claim

15

of liability, for example, or whether is -- the trustee

16

is looking for advice about how to manage the

17

beneficiary's money.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I'm the trustee,

19

and I say I would like legal advice as to whether I

20

should renegotiate this lease with the government.

21

MR. GORDON:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, I want that

23

advice so I manage the trust correctly, and I'm

24

concerned if I don't manage the trust correctly I'm

25

going to be sued.

Now is the document from the lawyer
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

responding to that inquiry privileged or not?

2

MR. GORDON:

I think, Your Honor, that if it

3

focuses on how to manage it properly, then -- and it's

4

prospective, then I think that the -- it -- it is not

5

privileged.

6

what I did and I'm concerned I may have screwed up, do

7

you think I'm liable, then I think a different answer

8

may obtain.

9

If, instead, you posit, you know, this is

is what I did and I might be liable, it's privileged.

MR. GORDON:

Please tell me what to do, yes.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Which means you can't get

preventative advice, which is one of the most important

kinds of advice an attorney can give.

important one can give.

all memos available of a certain type, which I think

this would fall into.

other things, attorney-client memos that are privileged

I would say -­
If there isn't an obvious

answer, I'll have to go away and worry about it.

MR. GORDON:

I would say, Your Honor, that

11

this Court's decision in Julian, where it said that

12

different classes of persons may have different rights

13

under FOIA -- the right we are talking about here is the

14

right of the beneficiaries.

citizen's right to see how Indian trust monies have been

managed.

We're not talking about the

MR. GORDON:

But I believe that under the

precedent in Julian, that it would be that what we're

talking about here is access to Indians whose money is

22

being managed.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we assume for the sake of

24

argument that a private trustee may, using the private

25

trustee's own fund, hire an attorney to obtain
35
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

prospective advice about liability, does that doom your

argument here for the reason that the government claims

it has no ability to set up a system like this, to have

4

MR. GORDON:

In the -- in

Well, Your Honor, at -- at some

5

logical level there is a link there that can never be

6

severed, but I submit, respectfully, that the

7

government, when it's getting advice about managing

8

trust funds, is not really focused on its liability.

9

The government's liability, after all, is much more

10

circumscribed than private fiduciaries, in any number of

11

ways.

12

It is seeking legal advice about what is the

13

proper way to invest, can we do this, can we pool funds,

14

can we do -- you know, can we make a certain type of

15

investment or is it prohibited to us.

16

that nature is advice to which the beneficiary is

17

entitled.

18

And advice of

A private beneficiary -- the beneficiaries

19

of private trusts are entitled, and Indians, whose money

20

is being managed because the government has taken on

21

itself by statute and said, we are going to take control

22

of your monies and we're going to manage them, have no

23

lesser right to get access to this highly relevant

24

information when they litigate for breach of trust.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You make a distinction,

I -- I take it, between attorney-client privilege and

2

work product.

3

theory that the tribe is in fact the client, but

4

apparently you are not pressing that point any more

5

about work product?

6

Initially, you were seeking both on the

MR. GORDON:

In fact, Your Honor, there is

7

some case law that says the fiduciary exception can be

applied to -- to work product.

9

point in the Court of Federal Claims.

We did not press that
We -- focused our

10

request for documents on attorney-client, not on work

11

product.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So under your theory

13

if there's a claim of privilege on -- on -- on the

14

government's behalf, presumably the district court would

15

conduct an in-camera review to determine whether it was

16

retrospective for liability or prospective for

17

responsibility?

18

MR. GORDON:

Yes, Your Honor, which is

19

exactly what happened here.

20

reviewed all of the documents in camera and made a

21

document-by-document determination, which is, of course,

22

the standard approach when you're talking about

That's the basis for your suit, right?

12

MR. GORDON:

Yes, Your Honor.

13

The -- I want to pick up, I believe it was

14

on a comment that you made, Justice Sotomayor, when you

15

said that under the government's theory there would be

16

no need for Rule 501.

17

not enough.

501 on its face says apply common law

18

principles.

And the government's argument is that's not

19

enough unless there's some other statute that requires

20

common law principles to be applied to.

21

And indeed, they say that it's

Now, this is a neat trick.

You just read

22

501 out of the Rules of Evidence when it comes to the

23

government, notwithstanding that 501 itself says it's to

24

be used to determine privilege claims by the government,

25

and that's reinforced in Federal Rule of Evidence 1101,
39
Alderson Reporting Company

which specifically says that the Rules of Evidence are

2

to apply in the Court of Federal Claims.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I suppose the

4

government as a whole has an obligation to act in the

5

best interests of the citizenry, right?

same theory apply to any citizen?

Why doesn't the

7

Look, government, you're supposed to -­

you're acting in a fiduciary statute -- status with

9

respect to me.

You're supposed to be acting in my best

10

interests.

12

get that.

13

If you're getting advice from the, you know,

MR. GORDON:

Your Honor, it -- I think that

14

that could pick up on the same distinction that the

15

Court has already drawn in Mitchell 1 and Mitchell 2,

16

between bare trust and a full-fledged trust.

17

government may have a general duty to act in the

18

interests of all citizens.

19

agree with that.

20

government is engaging in the conduct of a full-fledged

21

trust with respect to citizens.

22

The

Indeed, I think we would all

But that does not mean that the

It's not.

Its relationship to citizens day in and day

23

out is akin to, in fact maybe even a level below, the

24

bare trust relationship that was at issue in Mitchell 1.

25

So, we're not proposing a -- a sweeping new
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rule here.

It's the government that's proposing to

2

transform this Court's jurisprudence about Indians,

3

because the notion that the only enforceable obligations

4

it has are those set forth in statute or regulation,

5

were the Court to adopt that, it would be overruling its

6

decision in White Mountain Apache.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Are there any

8

other -- are there any other areas in which the

9

government's relationship to particular groups of

10

citizens is that of fiduciary to beneficiary?

11

MR. GORDON:

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13
14

Yes, Your Honor.
What are some of

those?
MR. GORDON:

Well, the -- the principal one

15

we could find, which is cited in our brief, is with

16

respect to government retirees who make voluntary

17

contributions to their fund, and the government's

18

argument here could be applied to them.

19

21
22
23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And your argument

could be applied to them?
MR. GORDON:
for it to be.

Yes, Your Honor, and I'm happy

I believe it should be.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if I'm a

24

government retiree, I have the ability to get the legal

25

advice that whoever it is that runs that trust gets?
41
Alderson Reporting Company

MR. GORDON:

Yes.

I might add, Your Honor,

fortunately it's not the Bureau of Indian Affairs that

3

runs that.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does that happen a lot?

I

MR. GORDON:

I will -- it -- 486 U.S. 1,

13

The -- there is another inconsistency in the

14

government's position here that I would like to

15

highlight for the Court, if I may.

16

government relies on the common law in the first place

17

to say it has a privilege.

18

gives the government attorney-client privilege.

19

relies on common law saying:

20

privilege.

That is this:

The

There's no statute that
So it

We have an attorney-client

21

Now, that's fine under Federal Rule 501.

22

But the government says, while it can rely on common

23

law, Jicarilla cannot rely on that same common law to

24

establish the limits on the privilege it's claiming.

25

This Court described that sort of argument as "heads I
43
Alderson Reporting Company

win, tails you lose," and said that it can't be right.

2

And I submit that it can't be right here.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The government is

maintaining throughout that it wears two hats.

hand it is the sovereign.

I agree, Your Honor, that

that's their claim.

11

the fact that it is the sovereign, which we certainly

concede, makes any meaningful difference for purposes of

the issue presented here.

that the government, because it is sovereign, in some

15

instances has broader authority than a private trustee

would to help out the beneficiary.

17

frequently.

5

the development of the duty of impartiality for private

trustees; and it's discussed at length in section 79 of

7

the Restatement.

Anytime you've got a life beneficiary and a

So the notion of competing interests is not
unique to the government.

The government may have some

10

different competing interests than a private trustee

11

might have.

12

does, the existence of a specific competing interest may

13

affect whether the action that the government takes is

14

or is not a breach of trust.

15

That's certainly conceivable.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if it

about competing interests.

those are interests of the beneficiaries that conflict.

interests, for example, are against the financial

adverse to the beneficiary.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Is this true regardless of

3

the fact that the government may have a very powerful

4

interest in seeking neutral, independent advice from an

5

attorney, and that were you to prevail that advice would

6

become watered down?

Yes, Your Honor.

I don't -- I

the same as it is for a private fiduciary.

There is no

Rule 501 Indian tribes are entitled to the same evidence

as other trust beneficiaries about how their money was

That is our request of this Court.

The trustee I guess

is -- is broadly conceived of as the government?

16

MR. GORDON:

Yes, Your Honor.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, isn't the

lawyer working for the trustee then a trustee too, an

19

employee of the trustee?

20

MR. GORDON:

I think that may in a

theoretical sense be true, Your Honor.

But practically

22

speaking, there's a difference between the BIA officials

23

who are acting as the trustee and the attorneys who are

advising the trustee.

It's not against the attorneys.

to -- we invoke a valid attorney-client privilege.

privilege.

19

exception is applicable to the government.

that the basis for this common law exception is not

The second point I would like to make is in

response to the contention that we have a full-fledged

25

trust here as opposed to a bare trust in Mitchell.
48
Alderson Reporting Company

I'm

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not quite sure what "a full-fledged trust" means in the

2

Indian trust context.

3

investment-related duties that the statute sets forth

4

with respect to trust funds, but this Court has made

5

clear in -- in Mitchell and reiterated in the Navajo

6

Nation decision that it's not enough for the statute to

7

simply set forth the statutory duties, but it must

8

define, and this is a quote, "define the contours of

9

those duties."

10

Certainly there's specific

The statutes at issue, section 161a, 162a,

12

general disclosure obligation, let alone the contours of

13

any such disclosure obligation.

14

disregard this Court's precedents in Mitchell and in

15

Navajo Nation, and we were to resort to the common law

16

to flesh out the nature of the responsibilities, again

17

there's nothing from the discrete investment obligations

18

that are set forth in those statutes that would lead to

19

a general disclosure obligation, let alone an intrusive

20

obligation to disclose the government's attorney-client

21

communications.

22

They don't even set out a

But even if we were to

And there's good reasons to think that

23

Congress did not apply such an obligation when it has

regime governing disclosures, and with respect to other

3

4

For example, the 1982 Indian Claims

The last point I would make goes to the

5

general duty to disclose.

6

simply on payment, ownership or other factors.

7

may not be the case that the payment is the sole factor,

8

it's certainly an important factor, and I think as my

9

friend responded in response to Justice Kennedy, if in

Whether that's contingent
While it

10

fact the private trustee is paying for the legal advice

11

on their own, that's going to be a significant

12

consideration as to whether the beneficiary can get it.

13

And as Justice Scalia pointed out, the lines

14

are not always going to be clear between trust

15

administration advice and liability advice.

16

they're often going to run into one another.

17

In fact,

Beyond payment, I think the even more

18

important factor here is the ownership of the records.

19

While payment is indicative of ownership, when we're

20

talking about the government context, payment is not the

21

only reason why we say that the government owns the

22

records that result from legal advice or any other trust

23

administration facet.

24

regulation, the Federal Records Act, and the Interior

25

Department regulations that are set forth in the

That's set forth by statute and

50
Alderson Reporting Company

appendix of the brief.

2

The reason why I think -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If I -- if I pay -­

3

if I pay a lawyer to prepare a document for me, is

4

that -- I do own that document or does the lawyer?

5

MR. SHAH:

I think as a general -- I think

6

as a general matter, one would think that the client

7

would -- it would belong to the client, at least in the

8

sense that the client would have full access to that

9

document.

10

And I think that's a fundamental distinction

11

here, that we're not -- because the -- these are

12

governmental records, they're subject to the statutory

13

and regulatory regime that governs disclosure of

14

government documents, either specific disclosure

15

obligations set forth by Congress, Interior Department

16

regulation or the more general Freedom of Information

17

Act.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But aren't you

19

confusing, just following up on the Chief Justice's,

20

ownership with access?

21

records less -- the government doesn't own them less

22

merely because FOIA requires them to share it with other

23

people.

24

legal obligation.

25

FOIA itself doesn't make these

So the ownership interest is not the defining

MR. SHAH:

You're absolutely correct.
51

Alderson Reporting Company

The

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

fact that they're accessible by FOIA does not -- does

2

not change the government's ownership of those records,

3

but the fact that Congress is able to set forth a scheme

4

like FOIA is turned on the fact that these are

5

government records that are owned by the government.

6

Because they're government records, it's

7

Congress and it's the Interior Department that decides

8

when to disclose them and under what circumstances to

9

disclose them.

10

The tribe's rule here would eviscerate

that very reticulated statutory and regulatory regime.
