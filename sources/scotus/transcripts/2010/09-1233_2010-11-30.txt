Mr. Phillips.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

What this Court has under review today is an

12

extraordinary and unprecedented order issued by a three­

13

judge district court requiring the release of between

14

36,000 and 45,000 inmates, currently incarcerated in the

15

California penal system, within a 2-year period.

16

The order in this particular case is made

17

particularly remarkable because it strikes me that at a

18

minimum it is extraordinarily premature.

19

come at some point in this process that an order,

20

probably substantially smaller in scope than this one,

21

may become appropriate.

22

an order or remedy of last resort, and what the district

23

court has done here is leapfrogged a series of steps

24

that should have been taken ahead of going this

25

particular route.

That -- it may

But if this is supposed to be

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

is pending for 20 years; is that not so?
MR. PHILLIPS:

3
4
5

One case, Mr. Phillips,

Yes, that's correct, Justice

Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it seems to me -- and

6

there were something like 70 orders from the district

7

court, the single-judge district court in that case.

8
9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's absolutely true,

Justice Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And no -- no change.

11

how much longer do we have to wait?

12

Longer than that?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

So

Another 20 years?

No, Justice Ginsburg.

I

14

think, obviously, the length of time you have to wait in

15

some ways depends on what the state of the remedial

16

phase is in the particular case.

17

in recognition, frankly, of the substantial problems

18

that were inherent in the -- in the penal system as it

19

existed during the 1990s and up until the early 2000s, a

20

receiver was appointed, specifically in the Plata class,

21

but there was also connections between the receiver and

22

the special master even in the Coleman class before the

23

three-judge panel was convened.

24
25

And in this case and

And under those circumstances and given the
extraordinary powers that the receiver had been
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

accorded, what should have -- the most logical course,

2

if this is supposed to be a remedy of last resort, was

3

to allow the receiver an opportunity to implement the

4

extraordinary powers that were conferred upon him, and

5

then see -- because if it turns out that we aren't

6

making progress -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Excuse me.

Could you

8

tell me -- from your briefs, I just haven't understood

9

what the alternative steps are.

The court below talked

10

about some proposals like construction and said the

11

legislature has struck them down.

12

crisis has gotten worse, so construction is really not

13

an option.

14

doesn't exist.

15

the conclusion was that even if you maximize the staff,

16

you don't have the facilities to add more staff, which

17

is what you need to cure the constitutional violation.

18

There's -- the fiscal

I don't see how you wait for an option that
They talked about hiring more staff, but

So tell me what specific steps outside of

19

this order should have been given time to be

20

implemented, because the receiver has basically said:

21

I've tried, and the small progress we made has been

22

reversed because the population just keeps growing, so

23

we can never get ahead of the problem.

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

4

the least restricted means would have been, other than

5

to say, throw it back to a receiver and special master

6

who are saying we don't have a solution outside

7

of reducing overcrowding.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

I don't think that's a fair

characterization of what the receiver said.

The

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Tell me -- give me concrete steps that are

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if you -- all you have

21

to do is look at what the receiver has done over the

22

course of the period of time since his appointment, and

23

particularly when the second receiver was put in place.

24

First of all, A.B. 900 has been enacted.

success in the hiring process.

4

close to 90 percent -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

They are -- we are at

Is there in fact less

6

overcrowding?

7

case was all about was the receiver has said, the

8

special master has said, we can't make any progress at

9

all until there are fewer people; we have no place to

10

Because I thought that the -- what this

put clinics.

11

The first step, not the last step, but given

12

the -- given what we're dealing with here, the essential

13

first step is that we have fewer people so there is more

14

room for these health facilities, more room for staff to

15

operate.

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Ginsburg, the

17

fundamental issue in this case seems to me as -- what is

18

the real cause of the constitutional violation here?

19

And the real cause of the constitutional violation here

20

has always been the culture of disregard for the inmate.

21

What the receiver was put in place for, the reason he

22

was appointed, and properly so -- this was with the

23

State's consent; this is not over our objection -- was

24

to change that fundamental culture and to provide, one,

25

construction, to provide increased numbers, to
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

provide -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

2

Yes, but you can't -- you

3

can't provide construction when the State doesn't supply

4

the money for it.
MR. PHILLIPS:

5

Except that since the

6

August 8th, 2008, period of time, you know, literally

7

hundreds of millions of dollars have gone to

8

construction specifically and more than $4 billion have

9

been spent on the provision of health care in this

10

particular system.

11

of the receiver.

And a great deal of that is because

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12

Then if you -- then if

13

there -- if there are these great changes in

14

circumstances so that now they -- medical care can be

15

administered in something approaching a decent way, you

16

could go back to the single-judge district court and

17

say:

18

changed; it's no longer the case that it's impossible to

19

render decent health care.

20

I'm moving under 60(b).

MR. PHILLIPS:

Circumstances have

Justice Ginsburg, I don't

21

think we could get that relief from the single-judge

22

district court, unless you're asking me to actually seek

23

to remove the entirety of the claim.

24

that says that we have to get to 137.5 percent of the

25

design, the design capacity, within 2 years is a

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

So you go back to that
It said if

Right, but that will always

6

be the case, Justice Sotomayor.

The fundamental

7

question here is:

8

approach that you're supposed to take as a court of

9

equity in this context.

Congress shifted dramatically the

This is supposed to be a matter

10

of last resort, which would mean that you would give the

11

receiver a full opportunity to do what the receiver -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

The receiver said the best

13

statement that seemed to me to summarize it.

It's in

14

his brief on page 9.

15

as you read that two paragraphs, it sounds as if

16

overcrowding is a big, big cause of this problem, which

17

is horrendous, which if you think it's accurately

18

described in the mental case in the first page, two

19

paragraphs -- now, if that's a fair description from the

20

record, it's a horrendous problem.

He has about two paragraphs.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

Well -­
What the receiver says is

23

overcrowding is a big cause of it.

24

think we've discovered you actually can provide care,

25

and certainly our plan and turnaround plan believes we
9
Alderson Reporting Company

And then he says:

I

Official

1

can provide constitutional levels of care no matter what

2

the population is.
So then you look to the care and turnaround

3
4

plan and it says spend $8 billion building more

5

buildings.

And then the legislature rejected it.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

Okay?

And then -­
Now, there we are.

More

time; what's supposed to happen?
MR. PHILLIPS:

9

No, but, Justice Breyer, the

10

legislature also approved a smaller but nevertheless

11

multibillion-dollar construction program.
JUSTICE BREYER:

12
13

something like that.
MR. PHILLIPS:

14
15

Well, I -- I mean, they

approved -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

16
17

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

23
24
25

Did they approve that?

Yes, they did approve that -­
Okay.

So he said:

We need

8 -­
MR. PHILLIPS:

21
22

And did they approve the

2.3 -- is that in place, 2.35?

18

20

Yes, it was 2.31 or

-- and that money is being

spent.
JUSTICE BREYER:

We need 8, and they

approved 2.35.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, and the receiver -­
10

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And is there any evidence

2

here that suggests that 2.35 is sufficient to cure the

3

constitutional violation?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

5

will get you there or not.
JUSTICE BREYER:

6
7

So I take it from your

answer the answer is no, there is no evidence.
MR. PHILLIPS:

8
9

Well, I don't know whether it

Well, there is the evidence

that the receiver asked for contempt for not getting the

10

8 billion and withdrew that motion.

So, obviously,

11

there is some sense in which the receiver is reasonably

12

satisfied with 2.35 billion as an opening gambit.

13

But, again, all of this goes to what is, at

14

least from my perspective, the fundamental question the

15

court should have evaluated in the first instance, which

16

is:

17

Are we ready yet to give up hope at this point?
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, what he says -- what

18

the receiver says about the 2.35, that it is a

19

significant step farther.

20

no construction at all.

21

to a conclusion that that current compromise will result

22

in sustainable constitutional health care at current

23

population density levels.

24
25

It is certainly better than
However, that is not equivalent

That's what he said about it.

So -- so we

have his views, and I'm back to my question:
11
Alderson Reporting Company

What else

Official

1

is supposed to happen?

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4
5

Well, there's -­
Which was your question

initially.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Justice Breyer, when the

6

receiver says that -- now remember, he says at current

7

population levels.

8

very clear, that it doesn't urge this Court to affirm

9

the particular order in this case.

He doesn't suggest, and his brief is

JUSTICE ALITO:

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

And the reality is that the population

Can I -­
Yes.
-- just finish this?

15

levels have dropped pretty significantly since August,

16

since the trial in this particular case.

17

actions by the legislature in A.B. 18 and the actions of

18

the legislatures in A.B. 900, there are both a lot of

19

expenditures on the table and substantial reductions in

20

the population size.

21

receiver's -­

22

And given the

And so, therefore, even under the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- do we have

23

information about that substantial reduction?

24

in this record, it just seems to be that it's -- no

25

matter how many efforts have been made, the population
12
Alderson Reporting Company

I mean,

Official

1

goes up.

2

down.

3

down?

And now you say that the population has gone

From what point in time and how much has it gone

MR. PHILLIPS:

4

Well, it's down to around, as

5

I understand it, about 147,000 from a high of around 165

6

to 170,000, and it has dropped, as we know, because

7

there has been a change in the good time credits.

8

has been a significant number of transfers.

9

that was the purpose of the governor's proclamation

10

There

I mean,

declaring an emergency.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

So it's possible that

12

within the 2-year period, you're going to hit the mark

13

if you -- that's what the lower court's -­

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think it unlikely.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's what the

16

three-judge panel said, which is:

17

of the proposals being made, you are likely to hit the

18

mark.

19

And if you don't, they invited you to come back and -­

20

you really don't think that if you hit 140 percentage,

21

that the court is going to order an immediate release of

22

the 2.5 percent over the limit it set?

23

ask you:

24

level over what additional period of time?

25

If you implement most

of federalism answer and then a basic sort of factual

2

point to be made here.

3

first, and then I want to come back to the -- what you

4

may regard as rhetorical, but nevertheless I think

5

important, which is that when we made our initial

6

proposal to the three-judge court suggesting what we

7

thought would be a reasonable reduction within a

8

reasonable period of time, it was met with both a motion

9

for contempt and summary rejection out of hand,

Let me make the second one

10

notwithstanding that there was improvement at the

11

time -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12

So what are we fighting

13

about?

14

or are we fighting about that you're angry that you were

15

told to do it in 2 years -- in 22 years, as opposed to

16

do it in 25 years?

17

objecting to?

22

No.

I think the -- no, this

goes to the federalism point.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20
21

Is that -- is that what you're

MR. PHILLIPS:

18
19

Are we fighting about that the plan was wrong,

Can -- can you do it in

5 years?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know.

I -- you know,

23

if -- if balancing all of the policies that the State

24

has to take into account, can it get there and is that

25

in the best interest of the State of California?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

If it

Official

1

is, yes, then we can get there.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

Well, the best interest

3

of the State of California, isn't it to deliver adequate

4

constitutional care to the people that it incarcerates?

5

That's a constitutional obligation.

recognizes that.

Absolutely.

So when are you going to

When are you going to avoid the needless

10

deaths that were reported in this record?

11

going to avoid or get around people sitting in their

12

feces for days in a dazed state?

13

get to a point where you're going to deliver care that

14

is going to be adequate?

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

17

When are you

When are you going to

But don't be rhetorical.
I'll do my best.

Thank you,

Your Honor.

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

I mean, first of all, let's

20

-- you know, if you look at the receiver's 2009 death

21

review which came out in September 2010, it specifically

22

says that there has been a significant downward trend

23

over the past 4 years.

24

in '09 were 66 percent of the average for the preceding

25

3 years, and the 9 homicides were 60 percent of the

The suicides -- the 25 suicides

average.

There have been significant improvements.
And the more important point in response to

2
3

your specific question, Justice Sotomayor, is that the

4

record in this case was cut off in August of 2008, and

5

so what we have are -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

Of course, but the problem

7

I have with that, Mr. Phillips, is that at some point

8

the court has to say:

9

the constitutional violation still persists, as the

10

State itself acknowledges.
MR. PHILLIPS:

11
12

You've been given enough time;

Well, I'm not sure we've

stated that.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

13

Overcrowding is the

14

principal -- overcrowding is the principal cause, as

15

experts have testified, and it's now time for a remedy.
The court can't -- has to at some point

16
17

focus on the remedy, and that's what it did, and that,

18

it seemed to me, was a perfectly reasonable decision.
MR. PHILLIPS:

19

Justice Kennedy, I agree with

20

everything you say except -- and I even agree with the

21

last statement, because, you know, you needed a

22

significant remedy.

23

you got a significant remedy when the receiver was

24

appointed in 2005 and implemented a program in 2006.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How much time do you think

2

the receiver needed?

3

should the court have given the receiver to develop his

4

plan and to try to implement his plan?
MR. PHILLIPS:

5

Well, there's no -- Justice

6

Kagan, there's no specific time frame.

7

obviously, we believe that we are entitled to a

8

reasonable opportunity to comply with the receiver's

9

orders and to bring ourselves ultimately into compliance

10

I mean,

with the Constitution, and -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

11

Well, at some point the

12

State itself said that if it had, I think, 7 years, it

13

could get down to 137.5 and didn't seem to object to

14

that.

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, that's --

16

Justice Kennedy, you know, given all of the other

17

constraints, et cetera -- again, there's a fundamental

18

difference between what you do under the hammer of a

19

district court order, which is what we have under these

20

circumstances, and what the State will do.

21

the State is absolutely committed.

22

That said,

I mean, the -- again, to go back to what is

23

the root cause of the constitutional violation, it's not

24

overcrowding.

25

constitutional rights of the mentally ill in the 1990s,

I mean, when California violated the

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

the prisons weren't crowded.

It was because there was a

2

fundamental lack of attentiveness to medical care under

3

those circumstances.

4

sure.

And that's unfortunate, to be

More than that.
But that was the reason.

5

To go back to your

6

point, Justice Kennedy, that's why the receiver, which

7

is an extraordinary remedy.

9

Department of Corrections, not just simply a facility or

To confer upon a private

11

Corrections' medical and -- medical health provision, is

12

incredible.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I thought that

14

officer himself said:

I can't do this without as a

15

first step reducing the population; nothing else is

16

going to work until we reduce the population to the

17

point where there is room for clinics, room for medical

18

personnel to operate.

19

district judge, the special master in one case, the

20

receiver in the other case.

I mean, that was the view of the

21

Everybody -- they all agreed reducing the

22

population is not going to cure it, not going to make

23

everything perfect, but without doing that as a first

24

step, nothing -- there will be no cure.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, even
18

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

if you accept that, and I don't think that's precisely

2

how I would interpret what the receiver said under these

3

circumstances anyway, but even if you accept that, the

4

idea of a 137-1/2 percent design cap that has to be

5

implemented within fewer than 2 years is a remedy that's

6

neither necessary nor sufficient.

the specific class.

MR. PHILLIPS:

So you can't deal with this

You have to provide space

I think, Justice Ginsburg,

19

the -- the fundamental point here is that it may

20

eventually be that you have to get to that stage, but if

21

you look at the receiver's reports since August 2008,

22

which consistently analyzed this issue, and they say:

23

And we have been able successfully to bring in very

24

qualified personnel, and we have significantly larger

25

numbers; we know there is construction in place; it may

not be as substantial as what I originally proposed; it

2

is nevertheless very significant.
And -- and Congress was very explicit that

3
4

the remedy of a prisoner release order should be the

5

remedy of last resort.
JUSTICE BREYER:

6

What would I look at to

7

find this?

It's a big record.

What I did was I -- it

8

refers to on-line evidence, and I went and looked at the

9

pictures, and the pictures are pretty horrendous to me.

10

And I would say page 10 of the religious group's brief,

11

for example, shows you one of them.
And what they're saying is, it's -- it's

12
13

obvious.

Just look at it.

You cannot have mental

14

health facilities that will stop people from killing

15

themselves and you cannot have medical facilities that

16

will stop staph and tubercular infection in conditions

17

like this.

And then you look at them.
Now, you've looked at them.

18

And what is the answer to that?

I've looked at

19

them.

20

in here that -- the special master said $8 billion is

21

the answer.

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

There's nothing

Well -­
And they haven't come

24

close.

So how can I -- or you if you were in my

25

position -- what would you say in an opinion that says
20
Alderson Reporting Company

1

that these three judges who have 200 pages of

2

findings -- what would you say to -- as an answer to

3

what I just said?
MR. PHILLIPS:

4

I would say that the

5

Prisoners Litigation Reform Act has a series of very

6

specific requirements that the Federal court has to

7

comply with, and that in deciding to go to a three-judge

8

district court in the first instance, you have to

9

examine the orders that are in place and whether those

10

orders have had a reasonable time within which to

11

operate.

And -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

12

Yes, but the State -- the

13

State did not claim that either order in either case has

14

succeeded in achieving a remedy.

15

that.
MR. PHILLIPS:

that, first of all, I'm not sure that's consistent with

10

the language.

12

the implementation of a specific remedy.

13

that's still a difficult and open question as to how to

14

proceed.

15

It's the primary cause of the

So I think

But it still strikes me that the sequence

16

that Congress envisions and the one that would make the

17

most sense and ultimately the one that hopefully would

18

accommodate both the plaintiffs' interests and the

19

State's interests, and the Department of Corrections'

20

interests, is to allow the receiver to stay on a course

21

that candidly I think will in fact get you there.

22

I mean, again, one of the real flaws in this

23

case, Justice Kennedy, is nobody doubts for a moment

that there have been very significant violations of

constitutional rights years gone by and, indeed, a

failure on the mental health side ultimately to get you

-- get to the point where we are in fact providing a

3

significant remedy.
The reality is, is that in the course of the

6

receiver, who coordinates with the special master on the

7

mental health side and does it with the cooperation of

there has been significant movement in the right

that part play itself out, we are going to leap ahead

played itself out and we wouldn't be here -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

at the club.

You had quoted his statements.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, to be sure, although,

candidly, we had -- we had referred to some of those

same statements even in the jurisdictional statement in

this litigation.

special master to file an out-of-time brief -- or I

But I

10

understand -- you know, we didn't object to it so long

11

as the Court was of a mind to hear from the receiver.

12

But I do think the most important part of

13

that, though, to keep in mind in this context is the

14

receiver didn't ask for this Court to affirm.

15

receiver simply clarified certain statements that had

16

been made and tried to say, as Justice Alito described,

17

put them into some kind of context.

18

that's fine, and we obviously don't have any quarrel

19

with -- with that particular presentation.

The

And that's -- and

But I do think to say that the receiver has

21

insisted that he cannot get to a constitutionally

22

permissible result without the order that has been

23

consistent with either the record and certainly not

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Phillips, my trouble

3

listening to you is that it seems as though you're

4

asking us to re-find facts.

5

judges who have been involved in these cases since the

6

beginning, for 20 years in the Plata case, who thought:

7

We've done everything we can, the receiver has done

8

everything he can; this just isn't going anywhere and it

9

won't go anywhere until we can address this root cause

10
11

You know, you have these

of the problem.
And that was the view of the judges who had

12

been closest to the cases from the beginning and the

13

view of the three-judge court generally.

14

reach a result essentially without, you know, re-finding

15

the facts that they've been dealing with for 20 years?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

So how can we

The -- there -- the

17

fundamental problem with the fact-finding in this -­

18

well, there are actually two fundamental problems.

19

First of all, remember that the receiver gets appointed,

20

and then 3 months later you get a motion for a

21

three-judge court.

22

itself before the receiver has even finalized the

23

comprehensive plan to bring everybody into compliance in

24

the first instance.

The three-judge court convenes

So the reality is that's -- that's the
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

fundamental legal error I'm asking this Court to

2

correct.

3

looking at the primary cause analysis, it seems to me

4

that's -- that's at most -- at best, a mixed question of

5

law and fact, and it's the kind of standard that this

6

Court ought to analyze to determine in the first

7

instance and on an independent review whether or not the

8

overcrowding is, quote, "the primary cause of the

9

violation."

But even if you get beyond that and you're

And what makes that inquiry particularly

10
11

appropriate for this Court, as opposed to simply

12

slavishly adhering -- deferring to the district court in

14

arbitrarily cut off the record in August of '08 and

15

there have been enormous developments since then.

So how could -- how could the plaintiffs

submit more than they did when the State said it's

enough, 2008 should be the cutoff?

5

difference between not allowing formal tours and all of

the rigamarole that goes with that, which is what the

State specifically objected to.

wanted to do and what the intervenors on our side in

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes.

Justice Ginsburg, I

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

understand what the ordinary rule would be in a -- of a

2

court of equity dealing with a constitutional violation.

3

But we're talking about an order entered under the

4

Prisoners Litigation Reform Act, and it's quite clear,

5

the statute couldn't be any plainer, that it shifts the

6

burden significantly onto the plaintiff when you are

7

going to go for a remedy as extreme as insisting that

8

somewhere between potentially 36,000 and 45,000 inmates

9

be released within a -- within a 2-year period of time.
Again, if you go back, you know, the

10
11

receiver has not -- at the time that all of this took

12

13

had devised a plan.

14

an enormous amount of money, $4 billion on health care,

direction, with the right attitude, in order to bring

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

But what about

Coleman is obviously a
33

Alderson Reporting Company

much -- a much more serious problem.

I don't doubt

ultimately that Coleman ought to go back for another

analysis based on the problems there, I could understand

order under those circumstances because then you'd have

7

to take out all of the evidence with respect to Plata

8

and let that play out.

But it seems -- and if the Court were to conclude

And it would be a very different prisoner release

But even that, it seems to me, would be a

9
10

mistake under these circumstances where the special

11

master and the receiver have been in a sense joined at

12

the hip in a variety of ways.

13

because the -- the receiver is controlling the provision

14

of medical care in the CDCR and the special master is

15

taking care of or trying to promote a very small slice

16

of that.

17

And it only makes sense,

So in the scheme of things, as you might

18

expect, the receiver consistently gets the ultimate

19

authority to make the decisions to help provide the kind

20

of resources, both in quality and quantity and staff and

21

construction and access to health care.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, this issue

23

about evidence -- did you proffer to the judge anywhere

24

in this record what the additional evidence it was that

25

you wanted to show?

I know that the decrease in

7

wait time between diagnosis and treatment that was

Mr. Chief Justice,

6

MR. SPECTER:

Well, I -- I agree with my

7

friend Mr. Phillips that the population has declined by

8

about 10,000 prisoners.

9

due to a transfer to out-of-State prisons, and, true,

Most of that decline has been

there's some -- some amount of it has been as a result

of the marginal increase in good time credits, which the

State elected to pursue on its own.

Can you explain what the

6
7

is that that has to do with the total number of

8

prisoners in the -- in the system in relation to design

capacity; isn't that right?

10

MR. SPECTER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

JUSTICE ALITO:

You could have -­
It's a remedy, Your Honor.
Or you could have a prison

13

where the -- the cells themselves are crowded, and yet

14

there are other facilities available for medical care

15

and plenty of staff to attend to those things.

16

what's the connection?
MR. SPECTER:

17

So

Well, that's -- that's -- and

18

you're right.

If there were -- if the cells were

19

crowded but the prison had all the other facilities

20

available, then there might not be a problem.

21

to -- well, I hope you can understand that in this case,

22

the prisons were built to double-cell the prisoners, but

23

they weren't built to provide 200 percent of health care

24

needs.

25

prisoners, they could meet their literal housing needs

You have

So as soon as they started to double-cell these

in the space of the cell, but they couldn't meet the

2

needs of their health care.
And that's why, Your Honor, the

3
4

137.5 percent figure is reasonable, because the Court

5

went almost a third overcrowding above what all the

6

experts recommended.
JUSTICE ALITO:

7

But why order the release of

8

around 40,000 prisoners, many of whom, perhaps the great

9

majority of whom, are not going to be within a class in

10

either of these lawsuits?

11

those people, rather than ordering the provision of the

12

construction of facilities for medical care, facilities

13

to treat mental illness, hiring of staff to treat mental

14

illness?

15

address what seems to be a different issue altogether?

16
17
18

Why order the release of all

Why not go directly to the problem rather than

MR. SPECTER:

Well, I have two responses to

that, and they're both a little separate.
The first point:

It's important to

19

understand that this is not a release order.

It's a

20

population-crowding reduction order.

21

ordering the State to throw open the gates of its doors

22

and release people.

more transfers to out of State.

24

facilities to increase the capacity.

The court is not

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

If all they do is to build

5

more cells, they're not going to address the problem.

6

So I -­

7

MR. SPECTER:

Exactly.

So that goes to the

8

second part of your question, which is:

Why don't they

9

try other things, like ordering the prisons to hire more

10

doctors, ordering better medication management, all of

11

those kinds of things?

12

appendix to the Appellee's Coleman brief, which lists 70

13

discrete orders which the Coleman court, single-judge

14

Coleman court, tried over a period of 15 years, which

15

have proven singularly to be ineffective.

16

why the court analyzed all those things; the trial court

17

analyzed all these things, and it made a finding of fact

18

that based on the statements by the special master, by

19

the receiver's reports, and by the general state of the

20

horrendous conditions which we have in these prisons,

21

that those discrete orders would not solve the problem.

22

And given the level of harm -­

23

And the answer to that is in the

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that's

I -- I still don't get it.

24

You're saying that they were ordered to do a variety of

25

things that directly address the problem and they didn't

So as a -­

2

MR. SPECTER:

No.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

In order to -- in order to

4

provide some kind of a remedy, we're going to order

5

something else that doesn't address the problem -­

6

MR. SPECTER:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8
9

No, that -­
-- that these lawsuits aim

at addressing.
MR. SPECTER:

No, Your Honor.

To the

10

contrary, Justice Alito, we -- I think the court

11

believes based on the facts that it found that this

12

would be an effective remedy.

13

they heard from experts from Texas, from Pennsylvania,

14

from Washington State -- all of whom had suffered, had

15

dealt with crowding in their prison systems, have said

16

that when you reduce the crowding, that's the critical

17

thing that you have to do now, because unless you reduce

18

the crowding, nothing else is going to work.

19

court found that that was exactly true.

20

All of the testimony that

And the

Nothing else over 20 years in one case and

21

over 8 years in another case has worked.

22

all -- as Justice Kennedy said, massive amounts of

23

evidence show that the primary reason it hasn't worked

24

is one singular word, overcrowding; and when you reduce

25

overcrowding, the prison will be able to operate and

the number of armed robberies, the number of assaults.

MR. SPECTER:

Your Honor, this trial court

8

found, based on 50 pages of its opinion, based on expert

9

testimony not only from our experts but from the State's

10

experts, from the intervenors' experts, they all came to

11

the unanimous conclusion that there are methods that -­

by which you can reduce crowding which will not increase

crime and that are safe.

The 145 figure

I believe, if that's what -- what you're referring to.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, do we -- do we know

at all what effect it has had?
MR. SPECTER:

It has had a marginal effect

5

on reducing the population.

There have been no reports

6

that it has led to an increase in crime.

7

But to get back to my earlier point and your

8

point, Justice Kennedy, about the -- the remedy and that

9

it should be the least intrusive possible.

This order

10

is set to take effect over a 2-year period, and during

11

that 2-year period, if Mr. Phillips is correct that the

12

conditions are constitutional and that they can deliver

13

services at 145 percent, then the State is free to come

14

in and make a motion to -- to bring those changed

15

circumstances to the court.

16

court has been incredibly sensitive to the -- to the

17

needs and desires of the State, and it -- it was

18

extremely reluctant to enter this order in the first

19

place, and it would -- and it would bend over backwards

20

to give the State discretion while attempting to -­

21

And, if anything, this

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I don't see a finding

by the three-judge court that 145, is it, would not be

I know that it -­

think it discussed the 145 figure in the context of the

-- of the fact that it didn't provide for health care

services.

7

down about 7 percent.

8

I believe.

So it discounted that a little bit and went
But it came close to that figure,

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

Can I ask you a

10

hypothetical question that I know is not your case?

But

11

let's say you had the district court entering an order

12

saying you have to bring it down to 137.5 in 2 years.

13

That will, as a practical matter, result in the release

14

of 40,000 prisoners.

16

us 4 years, we can reach the figure without releasing

14

now it's being transferred from the State legislature to

Federal district courts throughout the State.

16

MR. SPECTER:

Well, I believe the Federal

and the laws of the United States.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

No, no.

that as well, counsel.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What I'm saying is

23

that you have conflicting orders from different district

24

courts telling them you've got to comply with the

25

Constitution by spending 8 billion here; and another

court saying, I've got another constitutional problem of

my own, and you've got to spend 8 billion over there.

3

What is the State supposed to do in that situation?
MR. SPECTER:

4

Well, my simple answer to your

5

question, Your Honor -- and I don't mean to be

6

flippant -- but they're -- they have an obligation to

7

follow the Federal law, constitutional law and other

prisoners in a space built for 80, it's going to incur

15

certain obligations.

16

answer to Justice Breyer's question, the State could

17

choose to use less restrictive punishments, alternative

18

punishments, get a better bang for their buck, have more

It can either incarcerate 140,000 prisoners in

But that's -- if we -- if the court imposed

21

that kind of a rule, then the State would be here saying

22

it's -- it's violating comity provisions and making

23

policy choices for the State which it shouldn't.

24

believe in this case, the court gave the State the

maximum degree of flexibility to make all the policy

MR. SPECTER:

The State -- well, I just want

to remind you that the governor proposed to the

legislature that he reduce the prison population; he

2

said it could be done safely by the same amount, roughly

37,000 prisoners, in 2 years.

was basically what the governor had believed was safe.

10

methods -- the good time credits, parole reform,

12

those substantial reductions can be accomplished safely

13

in that amount of time.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

So should the court have

15

said 2 years for everything but construction?

16

that have been a more narrowly tailored remedy?

MR. SPECTER:

Right.

And the State has -­

24

prisons.

25

they've hardly constructed anything.

This case has been ongoing since 2006, and

respect to the state of the record and what was

That's volume 6 of the

20

intervening plaintiffs say we'd like to put on evidence

21

of constitutional violations.

22

Twice this court has said we will not receive that

23

evidence.

24

you can; please don't waste our time.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Look, I mean, the plaintiffs'

4

counsel talks about all of the things that you can do,

5

and if you -- if you look at 70a of the -- the

6

jurisdictional statement appendix, it specifically says

7

there's a line; above the line we can implement, and

8

that will get you about 16,000 inmates, and below the

9

line you need legislation in order to implement these

10

things.

But the reality is that anytime you say you're

11

going to release 30,000 inmates in a very compressed

12

period of time, I guarantee you that there's going to be

more crime and people are going to die on the streets of

there's no way out of that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

But if there were 5 years,

17

you think you could do it without any public safety

18

impact in the way that you told the court you could?
MR. PHILLIPS:

19

I think so, but I'm still

20

concerned, because the district court in this specific

21

says -- said:

22

impact of each of the State's -- of the elements of the

23

State's proposed plan.

The other point I want to make with respect

you can reduce the prison population, and to do it in -­

16

help to implement this in a very systemic way and that

17

will get us to where we want to get to.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why didn't you give

19

the court that as your plan?

20

absolute discretion to implement the plan that you

21

wanted; it said we don't want to do facility by
