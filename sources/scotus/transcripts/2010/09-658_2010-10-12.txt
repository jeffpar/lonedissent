ORAL ARGUMENT OF GENERAL JOHN R. KROGER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KROGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The court of appeals held that Arizona v.

12

Fulminante was the clearly established Federal law to

13

control and govern the outcome of this case.

14

an error, because this Court has never applied

15

Fulminante's direct appeal harmless error standard,

16

which places the burden of proof on the government, to a

17

collateral ineffective assistance of counsel claim,

18

where the burden of proof is on the inmate.

19

This was

In Boyer, unlike Fulminante, there is no

20

trial transcript to review because the defendant pleaded

21

no contest or guilty before trial.

22

appeals' decision conflicts with both

23

Strickland v. Washington and Hill v. Lockhart and will

24

have grave negative consequences for our criminal

25

justice system.
3
Alderson Reporting Company

The court of

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But isn't -- isn't

2

Fulminante relevant as -- just for the proposition that

3

a defendant's own confession carries heavy weight,

4

leaving the rest of it -- the statement that -- in

5

Fulminante that when a defendant confesses to the crime,

6

that carries heavy weight?

7

MR. KROGER:

Yes, Your Honor, I think it's

8

relevant to that extent, that a confession from a

9

defendant is significant evidence.

However, it

10

certainly does not imply, as the court of appeals

11

proceeded to do here, that it controls the prejudice

12

prong of Strickland, that it sets a new standard of

13

review of harmlessness, that it shifts the burden of

14

proof onto the government, or that it limits the

15

prejudice analysis to that question of the potential

16

impact of the confession at trial.

17

And so for all those reasons, I -- I think

18

the -- the court of appeals has gone well beyond any

19

potential relevance of the Fulminante decision.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is it -- if I am

21

understanding your argument, it is that the Court erred

22

in assuming that if the confession had been

23

suppressed -- which you're not arguing for or against.

24

I'm assuming you are not taking your amicus's position

25

that we have to get to the question of what would have
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

happened in a motion to suppress -- but that under all

2

circumstances, if there's a suppressible confession, a

3

defendant should never plead guilty.

4
5
6

You are saying that that conclusion is what
the Ninth Circuit drew and that was wrong?
MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, we're -- we are

7

suggesting that the court was wrong both in stating

8

Fulminante provided the standard of review, as well as

9

holding that you can, in effect, assume prejudice simply

10

because defense counsel failed to file a motion which

11

defense counsel believed was not -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's another way of

13

saying what I said, which is, no defendant should plead

14

guilty if it's a suppressible confession?

15
16
17

MR. KROGER:

That is correct, Your Honor.

That is correct, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So now, what

18

is the other information that would have made a plain

19

guilty in this case inevitable?

20

higher standard than you need to meet, but -­

21

MR. KROGER:

However, that's a

As -- as Your Honor noted, that

22

is a much higher standard than we have to meet under

23

Hill v. Lockhart.

24

defense counsel's advice that this defendant plead

25

guilty was sound and reasonable advice.

There were very good reasons why

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

First of all, the defendant faced a very

2

strong government case, even at that stage of the

3

investigation.

4

Second, there was a potential charge of

5

aggravated murder that could be brought if the case were

6

taken to the grand jury.

7

Third, the plea offer that was extended to

8

the defendant and which the defendant took was very

9

favorable to the defendant, both in terms of -- of

10

capping the amount of time that the defendant would

11

serve, as well as dismissing two additional mandatory

12

minimum charges of assault and kidnapping.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

14

the minimum he pled to?

15

higher?

16
17
18

MR. KROGER:

So -­

Were those higher than

Were those mandatory minimums

No, Your Honor, but they could

have been run consecutive rather than concurrent.
I -- I think more significant is the fact

19

that when the defendant himself testified about the

20

reasons he pled guilty, none of the reasons he provided

21

had anything to do with the strength of the government's

22

case or the failure of counsel to file the motion.

23

What the defendant said motivated his guilty

24

plea was a concern about an aggravated murder charge, a

25

desire not to have to testify against his brother, which
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

he believed would be the outcome of a guilty plea.

2

those factors were in the defendant's mind when he

3

decided to take the guilty plea.

And

4

So in this case, even if one were to shift

5

the burden onto the government -- and I do not believe

6

that -- that that is consistent with Strickland -- the

7

government would prevail here.

8
9

This case raises, I think, significant
consequences for application of Strickland and

10

Hill v. Lockhart.

11

burden of proof in a collateral proceeding on the

12

inmate.

13

Strickland and Hill clearly place the

The court of appeals here shifted the burden

14

of proof, pursuant to Fulminante, onto the government.

15

One can see this in the petition appendix at page 48

16

where the court states that there is not enough evidence

17

in the record to prove that the defendant would have

18

pled guilty had the confession been denied.

19

As I stated to Justice Sotomayor, I believe

20

the government actually could meet that burden, but that

21

is certainly not the burden that either Strickland or -­

22

or Hill requires.

23

Second, the Court's application of

24

Fulminante transforms the Hill v. Lockhart analysis.

25

narrows it to one degree, because it's focused on one
7
Alderson Reporting Company

It

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

issue, what the government's evidence would be at trial,

2

rather than looking at the broad array of issues which

3

might motivate a defendant to plead guilty which the

4

courts will look at under -- under Hill v. Lockhart.

5

For example, under Hill v. Lockhart the

6

court will not only look at the defendant's testimony

7

with respect to the estimate of the strength of the

8

government's case, but also look at the potential for an

9

additional sentence that is higher or additional charges

10

that carry a higher sentence if the defendant proceeds

11

with litigation rather than pleading guilty.

12

It will look at the investigation risk that

13

additional evidence would be found in, if the case

14

continued rather than terminating in an early plea.

15

it will look at personal factors such as the ones that

16

were evident in this case that might motivate a guilty

17

plea.

18

For those reasons, the Hill v. Lockhart

19

standard encompasses a broader array of factors in

20

determining whether there is prejudice than a simple

21

application of Fulminante's direct appeal post-trial

22

standards.

23

And

It is also the case that the application of

24

Fulminante will substantially increase the amount of

25

speculation which courts have to engage in compared with
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

applying the proper Hill v. Lockhart test.

2

Hill v. Lockhart limits the amount of

3

speculation by focusing on the defendant's motive in

4

pleading guilty and whether the ineffective assistance

5

could have influenced that decision to plead guilty.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about Judge Berzon's

7

test, that seems to be simple and a matter of common

8

sense, that if you get rid of the confession, then you

9

have a better chance of getting a good deal in the plea

10

bargain?

11

the defendant to get rid of that as well as weight on

12

the prosecution's side.

13

MR. KROGER:

The confession certainly -- it -- this serves

Your Honor, I would say two

14

things:

15

Berzon in the concurrence has never been recognized or

16

promulgated by this Court.

17

proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S. Code 2254, it would not

18

be clearly established law that the State court was

19

required to follow.

20

First, the test which is proposed by Judge

So in a collateral

And second, application of that standard, as

21

Judge Bybee noted in his concurrence, would require an

22

immense amount of speculation.

23

majority in the Ninth Circuit hypothesized that filing

24

the motion to suppress the confession would strengthen

25

the defendant's position in negotiation vis-à-vis the

In this case, the

Government.

2

It is also very possible, however, that the

3

Government would respond to filing a motion as opposed

4

to taking an early offer of guilty plea by taking the

5

case to the grand jury, seeking an aggravated murder

6

charge, and thus, putting the defendant in a worse

7

position in the case.

8

noted, he questioned whether the courts have the proper

9

tools to be able to speculate years after the guilty

And, in fact, as Judge Bybee

10

plea whether a particular motion may have increased or

11

may have decreased the amount of leverage that a

12

defendant has, or what kind of response that that motion

13

might have drawn from the prosecution.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

But you have to, don't you?

15

I mean, what's the alternative?

16

where it's clear there was a malpractice or an

17

inadequate assistance, and it happened a long time ago

18

and now you have to decide, well, was it prejudicial or

19

not?

20

would have gone to trial or wouldn't have pleaded

21

guilty, or -- and what's the alternative to trying to

22

figure out whether that's so?

It's prejudicial if in the absence of that he

2

So -- so what's the alternative?
MR. KROGER:

I think the alternative, Your

3

Honor, is application of Hill v. Lockhart, which looks

4

not at speculation about how this could or could not

5

have affected the plea bargaining process, but looks

6

very concretely at the defendant's pretrial

7

decision-making process and examines the record to

8

determine why the defendant pled guilty and whether they

9

can prove with a reasonable probability that he would

10
11

not have pled guilty -­

That would seem to me to be going

MR. KROGER:

Would he have pleaded

I -- I think the difference,

17

Your Honor, is that when you are applying

18

Hill v. Lockhart, you almost always have at least three

very concrete pieces evidence to show the defendant's

state of mind.

23

decision-making process his client engaged in, and then

you have the guilty plea colloquy itself.

You have the defendant's own testimony
You have the trial

So you always have a -- a concrete record
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that the court years later can review in order to

2

determine what motivated the -- the decision to plead

3

guilty.

4

If one were applying Judge Berzon's proposed

5

alternative prejudice finding, one would have to engage

6

in a great deal of speculation.

7

have defense counsel and the government make claims

8

about what they might have done in response to

9

hypotheticals, which does not seem to be a -- a -- a

10

reasonably judicable standard.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

One would, I presume,

As a -­
Without any

12

confession -- forget about the brother or the

13

girlfriend -- assume that there had been no confession,

14

wouldn't it have been a fair conclusion to draw that

bargaining strength of the defendant in this case would

3

MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, I still think

5

guilty plea would be a rational response to the

remaining evidence.

Even at this early stage in the

It had recovered

It had recovered the car

10

which the defendants had borrowed and which had blood in

11

the trunk where the victim had been locked and

12

transported.

13

They had four witnesses who were present

14

when the plan to kidnap and assault the victim was

15

hatched.

16

about the forming of the plot.

17

So they would have testified very directly

There was an eyewitness who identified the

18

defendant, Mr. Moore, at the trailer where the victim

19

was abducted.

20

co-conspirator, Mr. Salyer, who was cooperating with the

21

Government prior to the confession and whose -- whose

22

cooperation was known to the defendant.

23

And then, of course, there was a

So, with all of those pieces, even if one

24

stripped the three confessions out of the case, you

25

would still have a situation where the Government 's
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case was strong, where there was a very severe risk the

2

Government would go to the grand jury and obtain an

3

aggravated murder charge, and where there was

4

significant advantages to pleading early and locking in

5

a lower sentence to a felony murder charge.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kroger, from -­

7

General Kroger -- from everything you said, and I take

8

it -- from your brief, too, that you are not urging

9

the -- that -- that counsel's assistance was adequate?

10

You are not contesting that the confession was

11

involuntary?

12

prejudice issue; is that right?

13

You seem to be putting everything on the

MR. KROGER:

No, Your Honor.

We -- we

14

concede and forfeited the issue that the -- the motion

15

to suppress would have been meritorious, but believed

16

the district court got it right when it held that on

17

both prongs of Strickland, both on deficient performance

18

and on prejudice, the defendant has failed to make

19

his -- his -- meet his burden of proof.

20

I think the -- the prejudice argument here

21

is extraordinarily strong, but I think the deficient

22

performance, even if one concedes that the motion would

23

have been meritorious, the deficient performance prong

24

is strong as well, because the defendant can't meet his

25

burden of proof that defense counsel's representation
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

was unreasonable, given the strength of the government's

2

case, given the quality of the plea offer that was made,

3

and given the defendant's own reasoning for why he pled

4

guilty.

5

The case has significant practical

6

consequences for the criminal justice system.

One is

7

that if the Ninth Circuit's opinion stands, it will be

8

much easier to challenge guilty pleas years after the

9

fact on collateral challenge, and this will undercut the

10

principle of finality.

11

see fewer Government plea offers in cases like this, if

12

the Government believed years later it would have to

13

present all of its trial evidence in a collateral

14

proceeding in order to rebut the presumption under

15

Fulminante that there was prejudice.

16

One would certainly expect to

Second, it has severe implications for the

17

freedom of defense counsel to exercise its discretion

18

and represent its client using the wide latitude that

19

Strickland recognized was necessary.

20

stated that it's a mistake to hem in defense counsel

21

with strict rules about what should or should not be

22

done, because defense counsel needs that wide latitude.

23

If there is a -- a virtual presumption that motions to

24

suppress must be filed, even where defense counsel

25

reasonably believes it will not resound to the advantage
15
Alderson Reporting Company

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

If -- if he had gone to

5

trial, what's the sentence -- what's the range of

6

sentence he could have gotten?

7

MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, if he had gone to

8

trial on the charges that were pending, and these -­

9

these were not charges from the grand jury, he would

10

have faced at least the mandatory minimum of 25 years

11

that he pled guilty to, plus the potential of

12

additional -- an additional sentence both on that charge

13

perhaps as high as life, given the two other potential

assault that could be brought.

It could have been a capital

This could have been an aggravated
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

murder case because the facts involved a very severe

2

beating to the extent perhaps of torture where a

3

Defendant who was very vulnerable who had a protruding

4

hernia that was in a truss was savagely beaten, his nose

5

was broken, he was locked in the trunk of the car, taken

6

to a remote location and shot in the temple with one

7

shot of a revolver.

8
9

It is distinctly possible that the state
would have come from the Grand Jury as a capital case

10

and at the very least have been an aggravated murder

11

carrying a life sentence, not a 25-year sentence.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about his argument

13

that his failure -- the Defendant in the case arising

14

out of this episode, if Salyer did go to trial and he

15

ended up getting that exact same sentence that this

16

Defendant did?

17

MR. KROGER:

Yes, Your Honor.

Mr. Salyer

18

did receive the same sentence after he went to trial.

19

His case, though, was very different from that of the

20

Petitioner, because the Petitioner was the individual

21

who cocked the pistol and fired the round into the head

22

of the victim killing him.

23

that the other two co-conspirators would have found

24

themselves charged with an intentional murder based on

25

the facts of this case.

And so it is very unlikely

But because this pistol could
17

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only be fired if it were cocked and because the round

2

went into the temple, it would have been a reasonably

3

strong aggravated murder case against this Defendant who

4

was the triggerman.

5

The final point I would like to make to the

6

Court is that this case involves or should involve

7

significant deference to the State court decision.

It's a little hard when we

take away the finding that the confession was

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm not quite sure what to

21

do with the State court's case, assuming we have to

22

presume, because of the posture of the case, that the

23

confession was inadmissible.

24
25

MR. KROGER:

Your Honor, I would say two

things with respect to that.

First of all, the State

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

court's decision, even if it were incorrect in its

2

ruling that the confession would not have been

3

admissible, the State court's conclusion that the motion

4

would not have assisted the Defendant in any way, the

5

finding that it would have been fruitless because of the

6

other confessions, the other two confessions in the

7

case, is a reasonable decision that the Court made and

8

is dispositive and thus under AEDPA should receive

9

deference.

10

I would also suggest the case is somewhat

11

similar to Yarborough v. Alvarado.

12

issue at stake and this Court explicitly held that one

13

might come out one way or the other on the custody

14

issue, that reasonable jurists might split, but that

15

that fact alone rendered the State court's opinion on

16

voluntariness or on custody in that issue as reasonable.

17

There was a custody

And again, as here, though we are not

18

asserting that this confession was admissible, should

19

the Court consider it, it's clearly a close question on

20

voluntariness and somewhat factually similar to

21

Yarborough where even if the State court were was wrong,

22

it was still a reasonable adjudication of the claims.

23

If there were no further questions from the

24

Court, Your Honor, I would like to reserve the remainder

25

of my time for rebuttal.

Thank you, counsel.

MR. WAX:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

7

Mr. Moore established prejudice under Hill

8

from his attorney's failure to recognize the

9

involuntariness and inadmissibility of the lengthy tape

10

recorded statement obtained from him by the police.

11

most critical type of evidence that the State can have

12

in any case.

13

The

The Ninth Circuit's conclusion to that

14

effect was correct, and was correctly based on this

15

Court's precedence of Strickland, Hill, and Kimmelman.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I am having a little bit

17

of trouble here with your argument for the following

18

reasons.

19

unreasonable for the defense attorney to have concluded

20

that the evidence showing your client's presence at the

21

shooting, and identification as the shooter, that it was

22

solely that he should have gone to trial on a defense

23

that he wasn't involved in the shooting at all.

24
25

Assume we suppress the confession.

Why is it

Once you put him in this shooting, then the
only issue he seems to be confused about is that he
20
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

thinks that because it was accidental that that presents

2

a defense to felony murder.

3

erroneous position on his part.

4

And that's clearly an

So what made the case so weak that the

5

Government was never going without the confession to

6

prove felony murder?

7

MR. WAX:

Well, Your Honor, we believe that

8

the case is not as the State would have it, a strong

9

case in the absence of this confession.

10

We also believe that the proper focus is not

11

solely on the strength of the State's case, and that

12

under Hill it is necessary to look at the totality of

13

the circumstances, and look for the objective factors in

14

this record that inform the decision of what Mr. Moore

15

would have done or would have been likely to have done

16

in the absence of his counsel's mistakes.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

What does your office do in

18

this situation, all right, a client is indicted in

19

Federal court and you anticipate that there are all

20

sorts of motions that you might make if this case is

21

going to trial, but at an early point the prosecution

22

offers you what looks like a really good plea bargain.

23

Now do you litigate all those motions?

24

know, you have a chance of winning, of suppressing some

25

statements that your client made, suppressing physical
21
Alderson Reporting Company

If you have, you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

evidence, getting certain evidence excluded with a

2

motion in limine, maybe you could win on a severance

3

motion, do you think you litigate all those rather than

4

grabbing a good plea deal when it's offered to you?

5
6
7

MR. WAX:

Your Honor, the answer is

certainly no, we do not litigate all of the motions.
JUSTICE ALITO:

So if you take the deal,

8

then you want it later to be open to the Defendant if

9

he's not, you know, after the Defendant has spent some

10

time in jail, he's not too happy with the deal any more,

11

he can now come back and say, well, the Federal public

12

defender's office was ineffective because they could

13

have moved to suppress my confession and the illegal

14

search, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, that is all

15

open for relitigation years later?

16

MR. WAX:

No, Your Honor.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

18

MR. WAX:

No?

And the issue here is not as we

19

have attempted to articulate in our brief solely and in

20

the abstract the failure to file the motion.

21

problem is that Mr. Moore's attorney did not understand

22

that the statement was suppressible.

23

that you are putting to me, if I or an assistant in my

24

office says to a client, look, there is a strong motion

25

to suppress the confession, the drugs, what have you,
22

The

In the situation

1

but here are other factors that we should look at.

2

at the conclusion and with that proper advice the client

3

decides I will take the deal, then I have performed

4

effectively, and the case is not one that could be

5

subject to a collateral attack as this case is.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

What would have been the

defense?

MR. WAX:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What would have been the

10

defense absent the confession?

You have one at trial on

11

the confession, suppressing it, how would he have defend

12

the this case?

13

MR. WAX:

Excuse me, Your Honor.

Your Honor, he would have been

14

able to defend this case first by articulating the

15

Government's obligation to prove his guilt beyond a

16

reasonable doubt.

The brother is a police informant.

MR. WAX:

That is true, Your Honor, but the

police had used them as their agent.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what does that have

to do with what interest does his brother have when he

going to use this as a future chip in case he does

there are 11 findings of fact.

Yes, of course.

However, the

JUSTICE BREYER:

If I assume that the word

"fruitless" and the reference to Strickland were a

that the evidence with respect to the strength of the

State's case includes the facts that the attorney
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

general has identified.

2

no question but that the objective record showed that

3

the brother's testimony would have been highly

4

impeachable based on his prior work as an informant, his

5

description of himself -­

6

There is also as we perceive it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Impeachable how?

What

7

motive did he have to implicate his brother?

You still

8

haven't answered that question.

9

he was a past cooperator, he had no pending charges, and

All you keep saying is,

10

now he has a motive to do this against his brother

11

because of that?

12

MR. WAX:

Your Honor, I cannot point in the

13

record to a motive.

14

that there is in the record his self-description of

15

himself as the golden boy for the police, his working

16

with the same detective who interrogated his brother

17

years before when he completely avoided a murder charge.

18

What I can point to is the fact

And as a defense attorney, in a case

19

involving a group of men who are not necessarily as

20

socialized and well educated as some other group, that

21

his testimony would have been subject to impeachment.

Mr. Wax, just to clear

And while in some

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

circumstances the court will equate a nolo plea with a

2

plea of guilty, in these circumstances the fact that he

entered a nolo plea only is highly significant on the

4

question of whether or not he would have rolled the

5

dice.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And a competent -- and a

7

competent counsel is supposed to accept their irrational

8

client, who doesn't want to understand the law, and let

9

him risk getting an aggravated felony charge brought

10

against him, or a capital murder charge brought against

11

him, and not -- and just go ahead?

12

because he's not going to recommend to the client, go to

trial, take the plea, because you're irrational?

That's really what you

are saying, that a competent attorney would not

downside is almost a given.

MR. WAX:

statement to that effect.

In all the cases where we

have found where there is such a direct statement, the

courts almost always discount them.

we submit, is something more significant, and that is he

did not want to enter a plea.

his attorney had been ineffective, he moved to undo the

That advice is conceded by the State to have

And while a plea petition form is standard

6

in many State courts, as it is in the Federal court, the

reality is that those forms often include statements

that are not consistent with the facts that have been

presented or that have occurred previously.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I just clarify

something?
Is it your position that the prosecutor, in

13

making his offer of proof at the plea on 227 to 228,

14

affirmatively said that this was an accident or did

15

not -- did not allege that it was intentional?

16
17

MR. WAX:

He affirmatively states that there

was no intent to kill.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

19

MR. WAX:

21

Where is that?

I -­

I believe it's on page 228, where

he comes back in and says one more thing.
It is on 228.

And just something that I

22

missed early on:

23

was to instill fear to the point that the victim would

24

not again rip them off. " The description -­

25

"The indicated intent of the defendant

JUSTICE ALITO:

You read that as a -- as a

MR. WAX:

Yes, sir.

tragedies.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

I have to say, I think

12

that's a very aggressive reading of what was said here.

13

It was not necessary for the plea to this offense to

14

prove an intent to kill, and the statement that the

15

intent that was necessary, which is lesser intent but

16

sufficient to support this plea, was present is not a

17

statement that a greater mens rea was absent.

18

And I thought you argued to us that the

prosecutor said this was not intentional.

MR. WAX:

It was an

description of Mr. Rogers falling back into the gun.

is followed by the judge, who articulates the

circumstances of this case as involving two tragedies:

To be sure, the death of Mr. Rogers, but also the
