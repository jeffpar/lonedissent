MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Congress expressly exempted from Social

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The medical residents

Mr. Olson, are -- are all

institutions that employ residents schools?
MR. OLSON:

I don't know -- I don't know

23

whether all -- as I understand, the resident program,

24

which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for

25

Graduate Medical Education, does involve an

1

accreditation program which would probably fit -- where

2

it's taking place, would probably fit the definition of

3

schools.

4

There are -- these -- the institutions that we

5

represent -­

That is certainly not an issue in this case.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But it might -- it might

7

be relevant, because it would be unseemly, perhaps, to

8

have residents who are not working at, quote, "schools,"

9

subject to the FICA tax, and other residents whose

10

training is approximately the same escape the tax.

11

MR. OLSON:

Well, that was a judgment that

12

Congress made.

13

to students, and it tied specifically in to someone who

14

is enrolled and regularly attending classes -­

15

Congress made the exemption with respect

5

anything of that nature.

6

So it could be something out

It is undisputed that these individuals in

7

these residents' programs are enrolled and that they are

8

regularly attending classes by various definitions of

9

the word "class."

The clinical experience that they are

10

receiving in hospital rooms, in lecture halls, in all

11

circumstances that they're involved in, are educational.

12

They are classes, and it is undisputed -- undisputed -­

13

that the purpose of these programs is to educate doctors

14

so that they can achieve board certification and

15

hospital privileges.

21

question.

The answer to the second part is:

Of course

22

23

This is not a question of law; it is a question of fact.

9

Is someone really a student or not?

Common sense and

common understanding of the word "students" would lead

11

one to the conclusion of that.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

such service is performed by a student, et cetera, as

saying, look, there's a student status, and the service

19

is distinct from the student's status?

20

Take the typical work/study program in a

21

college.

That would seem to fit this language to a tee.

22

There's a student, and the student is working part time,

23

but you are -- there -- there is no independent

24

significance to the term "student" as you read the text;

until the fact that they lost several cases, was that if

your purpose was to achieve or pursue a course of

studies -- that's the old regulation.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

As -- as the

If your -­

this fit the work/study student who is studying

12

philosophy and then he's working in the, say, speech

department?

14

MR. OLSON:

I didn't hear that last word.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- it seems to me

16

that -- what came into my mind when I read these words

17

was a work/study program where the student is studying

18

and that's the status of student.

19

from that.

It's not necessarily to advance the person's

20

education.

It's to give the student some money.

21

that's what I thought -- I thought that this was -- this

22

was describing student status, okay; and the student is

23

also working for some money.

MR. OLSON:

Well, this -- absolutely, that's

true in this case.

laboratories, is a part of what they're getting paid

for.

have in mind someone being paid for -- by someone

No, I have in mind the

15

administration, helping out with clerical things there.

17

But the student status is one thing; the services are

another.

19

The -- the student signs up

Now, that, I assume, would be covered, that

20

the earnings of the student in the work/study program

21

would not be subject to FICA?

22

MR. OLSON:

Well, the government's got

23

various categories of examples.

The situation that

24

you've just described sort of falls close to one of

25

those examples, but this is -- that is not this case.

The government would say, I would think,

that if you are a student, even though your service is

I think that's one of the examples that the

focusing, Mr. Olson, on -- on this case.

14

things that I think is important in the tax code is that

15

you not have litigation of each different case, so the

16

different courts are coming out with different rules.

talked about the employment, how it has to be an

22

incident to the study.

23

Then, for many, many years, they have

21

That argument is not correct,

The exemption provided in 3121(b)(10) does

So for all those purposes, Title VII, the

It doesn't have any other implication.
And the Government's position in that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

14

FICA student exemption covers individuals

15

who are predominantly students but perform incidental

16

employment for their schools.

17

Petitioners' medical residents.

concluded that an employee's paid work does not make him

20

an exempt student, even if he also learns from his job.

21

It does not cover
They are full-time

And that's true for three reasons.

First,

22

the text of the student exemption makes clear that it's

23

not a broad exclusion for apprenticeships and other

24

learning jobs.

25

applies only to students performing services for a

Instead, it's a narrow exemption that

school, college, or university where they're enrolled

2

and regularly attending classes.

3

And, second, when employees are working long

4

hours and being paid substantial amounts, they and their

5

employers should be helping to fund the Social Security

6

system, and they should be earning credit towards

7

benefits so that they and their families will have

8

something to fall back on if they become disabled or

9

die.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the question is whether

11

someone is predominantly a student or an employee, why

12

shouldn't we ask:

13

program, and why is the institution enrolling them in

14

the program?

Why are they enrolled in this

15

Why are residents enrolled in the program?

16

Are they enrolled in the program to make money, or are

17

they enrolled in the program either because it's a

18

licensing hurdle they have to clear or they want

19

additional education, and why is the institution hiring

20

them?

21

of their services or is it hiring them for educational

22

purposes?

23

Is the institution hiring them to get the value

MR. ROBERTS:

It's probably both, Your

24

Honor, but it's not workable to determine student status

25

by looking in a particular case whether the predominant
25

1

motive or the motive of the employee or the employer is

education.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, in general, though.

In general, why are residents -- why do medical school

5

graduates become residents?

6

doing that because they want to earn the 40 to $50,000 a

7

year that they're paid, or are they doing it for some

8

other reason?

9

MR. ROBERTS:

Do they do -- are they

I think they're doing it for

10

both -- for both reasons, Your Honor.

11

individuals pursue their jobs for the primary purpose of

12

learning, like judicial law clerks, like other

13

apprentices.

14

covered by this exemption.

15
16
17

But many, many

But they're not excluded -- they're not

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because they don't work

at schools.
MR. ROBERTS:

Because they don't work at

18

schools, colleges, and universities, and they, you know,

19

may not be enrolled and regularly attending classes.

20

And so the Treasury reasonably concluded that because

21

this isn't a general exemption for apprenticeships, that

22

they shouldn't construe it as providing a special

23

exemption for apprentices who happen to be employed by

24

schools, colleges, and universities.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And -­

What if they -- on average

26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

they were paid $10,000 a year?

2

MR. ROBERTS:

Yes.

Would it be the same?
If they would -- if

3

their work -- I mean, here, basically, they have work,

4

and the argument is that that work qualifies them as

5

students.

6

has concluded is that it's going to treat work and study

7

as distinct categories in deciding whether somebody is

8

predominantly a student, and that it's not going to

9

count the work as study even if there's some educational

10

And what the -- what the Treasury Department

component to it.

11

And that's reasonable for several reasons,

12

as I said.

13

general provision that's designed to cover

14

apprenticeships.

15

primarily workers and they're working for long hours,

16

they should be covered and participating in the FICA

17

system.

18

First, because the statute just isn't a

And, second, because when people are

And, finally, it -- it would be very

19

difficult to determine on a case-by-case basis what's

20

their purpose, what the employer's purpose.

21

is this job more like study?

22

work?

23

decide whether that should make them a student.

You know,

Is this job more like

And on that basis -- and to, on that basis,

24

So considering all of those things, the

25

Treasury has decided to draw a bright line and say:
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

Study is study; work is work; and if you're not a

2

student independently of that, then your work doesn't

3

make you a student.

4

that if you're working full-time, that then you're

5

predominantly an employee rather than predominantly a

6

student, and you're not covered by the exemption.

7

And the Treasury has also decided

In addition, FICA's historical development

8

indicates that the student exemption doesn't cover

9

medical residents, because at the same time that

10

Congress enacted the student exemption, it also enacted

11

a separate exemption for medical interns, and it decided

12

not to include residents in that exemption.

13

actions would have made little sense if the student

14

exemption had the scope asserted by Petitioners.

15

And those

And then, in 1965, Congress repealed the

16

intern exemption in order to give young doctors an

17

earlier start in building up Social Security coverage.

18

And that repeal also wouldn't have achieved its purpose

19

if many and most residents were covered -- were excluded

20

from FICA under the student exemption.

21

These -- these residents are people.

22

They're working between 50 and 80 hours a week.

23

working over a long period of time, and they're

24

providing critical patient care with minimal

supervision.

MR. ROBERTS:

MR. ROBERTS:

I'm not resisting the

proposition that clinical work can constitute a course.

7

What I'm saying is that when you're -- when you're being

8

paid to provide services, that doesn't count as a

9

course, because the IRS has decided to treat work and

10

study as distinct categories in -- in applying this

11

exemption, and that that's a perfectly reasonable

12

distinction.

13

Nothing in the statute precludes them from

14

doing that, and Petitioners concede that -- that it's

15

reasonable to interpret the statute as limited to

16

individuals that are predominantly students.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Roberts, do you know

18

the answer to the question I asked Mr. Olson; that is:

19

Are all hospitals with resident programs schools?

20

MR. ROBERTS:

No, Your Honor, they're not.

21

First of all, under the IRS's regulations, the IRS

22

defines schools, colleges, and universities to include

23

only institutions whose primary function is the

24

provision of formal instruction.

And, second of all, if -- on J.A. 27a, in

programs that are not students.

10

Do the Hennepin County

Not at the present

So, that is an example of one, Your Honor.

11

And that does point out an anomaly about Petitioners'

12

interpretation of the exemption.

13

work for hospitals that are operated by schools,

14

colleges, and universities would be exempt from FICA

tax, but residents who work for other hospitals wouldn't

be exempt, even though their work is equally

educational.

18

principle that this isn't an apprenticeship exemption,

19

and that's why, because of that, the Treasury has taken

20

this approach to the situation where people are learning

21

on the job.

22

Medical residents who

That's just an illustration of the broader

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Roberts, the

23

Petitioners' brief says twice that there's some

24

question.

25

residents are subject to the FICA tax, there's some

Assuming that we hold that the -- the

33
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

question whether, even if they had to pay the tax,

2

whether they would be eligible to receive Social

3

Security benefits or, I take it, credit for four

4

quarters in full.

5

MR. ROBERTS:

There's no -- there's no

6

question, Your Honor.

It's always been the Social

7

Security Administration's position that medical

8

residents are not students exempt from the Social

9

Security Act.

The Social Security Administration stated

10

that in a Social Security ruling as far as back as 1978,

11

and they continue to adhere to that position.

12

In addition, as a practical matter, the way

13

the Social Security Administration determines whether

14

people get coverage for a particular period under the

15

Social Security Act is they look at the W-2's that come

16

in, and if FICA tax has been paid, then they put them

17

down as being covered under the Social Security Act.

18

as a practical matter, it works that way as well.

19

So

As I said before, these workers who are

20

working between 50 and 80 hours a week over many years

21

for substantial salaries are precisely the kind of

22

workers whose employers should be supporting the Social

23

Security system and who should be earning credit towards

24

disability and survivor benefits.

the judgment of the court of appeals be affirmed.

MR. OLSON:

Well, I -- this is up to the

Court.

The Court cited the National Muffler case in the Cottage

Savings case, which is subsequent to Chevron.
