ORAL ARGUMENT OF MEIR FEDER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. FEDER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The North Carolina Court of Appeals asserted

12

jurisdiction over Petitioners in this case on claims

13

that arose from a bus accident in France that was

14

unrelated to any North Carolina contacts.

15

Petitioners are located overseas and do not conduct any

16

business in North Carolina, the court held that North

17

Carolina had general jurisdiction over these defendants

18

based solely on the sale in North Carolina of a small

19

fraction of their products.

20

Although the

Under this Court's cases, the mere sale of a

21

defendant's products in a State does not permit the

22

State to reach out to assert judicial power over all of

23

that defendant's worldwide conduct.

24

permissible, every significant seller of products would

25

be subject to suit everywhere on any claim arising
Alderson Reporting Company

If that were

Official - Subject to Final Review

4
1

anywhere.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's one piece of this

3

I don't quite comprehend.

4

that there is jurisdiction over the parent, right?

5

MR. FEDER:

You -- there's no contest

Yes, Your Honor.

The parent

6

company consented to jurisdiction in North Carolina.

7

It's appointed an agent for service of process there.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So it's -- it's based on

consent?

10

MR. FEDER:

Yes.

They also have other

11

business that the parent does conduct in North Carolina,

12

but there is no objection to jurisdiction over the

13

parent here.

14

who are corporations from Turkey, France, and

15

Luxembourg.

16

This case solely concerns the Petitioners,

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think there is

17

general jurisdiction over the parent?

18

were not in the picture, is there?

19

jurisdiction go beyond State of incorporation, principal

20

place of business?

21

MR. FEDER:

If the consent

Does general

I think that that is a hard

22

question, Your Honor.

The short answer is I think the

23

answer is "no," but I think that that is probably a

24

close case -- again, putting aside the consent.

25

do think that general jurisdiction is about suing a
Alderson Reporting Company

But I

Official - Subject to Final Review

5
1

company -- at least in the case of corporations, is

2

about suing the corporation essentially where it's

3

located or at home.

4

against the corporation there.

5

It's always fair to bring a suit

I think that once you get beyond that, which

6

is a situation that would be analogous to a State's

7

power over a citizen or a resident of the State, I think

8

you run into great difficulty finding a basis for the

9

State to assert authority over claims completely

10

unrelated to any business that -- or any contacts that

11

the corporation has with the State.

12

That said, it wasn't contested here, and

13

there is a consent to service of process, which may or

14

may not create general jurisdiction.

15

disagreement in the lower courts on that, but none of

16

that is contested in this case.

17

There's a

And without having to get to that particular

18

question of whether in fact it's limited to -- whether

19

general jurisdiction is limited to place of

20

incorporation or principal place of business, first of

21

all, there's much more directly controlling authority.

22

In this case, the most directly relevant cases are

23

Helicopteros and Consolidated Textile v. Gregory,

24

working in tandem.

25

In Helicopteros, which was this Court's last
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

6
1

corporate general jurisdiction case, the Court said that

2

there was no general jurisdiction based on $4 million in

3

purchases in the State and some other contacts.

4

key is that -- on that point, is that the Court held

5

that mere purchases could not provide the basis for

6

general jurisdiction because the pre-International Shoe

7

decision in Rosenberg was controlling on that point.

8
9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And the

Again, this is

preliminary, and it just goes back to Justice Ginsburg's

10

question.

11

there's general jurisdiction over the parent company.

12

Then under respondeat superior, it would be liable in

13

North Carolina for the -- all the acts of its agents.

14
15
16

Suppose you could help me out.

MR. FEDER:

I assume that

I think that's a fair

assumption.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Then why isn't it

17

automatically liable for all the acts of its

18

subsidiaries?

19

MR. FEDER:

Well, because I think -­

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -- and does that

21

get -- and does that get into what in the Federal

22

practice would be necessary parties?

23

MR. FEDER:

What -- Your Honor, I think that

24

really what it gets into is the difference between a

25

subsidiary and an agent, because a subsidiary is not
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

7
1

automatically acting as the agent of the parent company

2

in a way where you'd get respondeat superior.

3

think that part of what's going on in this case is that

4

when this does go back to North Carolina for trial or

5

for litigation against the parent company, I think that

6

under North Carolina or whatever State's or nation's

7

veil piercing or agency standards the North Carolina

8

courts will apply, the plaintiffs will have great

9

difficulty actually with the substantive case against

And I

10

the parent company, because you would actually have to

11

show involvement in the actions that actually the claim

12

arose out of here.

13

The mere general control that's inherent in

14

the parent-subsidiary relationship is not going to

15

create liability, and here -- important to remember -­

16

we're talking about a tire manufactured in Turkey,

17

accident in France which Goodyear Tire and Rubber

18

Company -- and, now, this is outside the record, as I

19

understand it -- did not have any direct connection

20

with.

21

question here, but I -- just for sort of setting the -­

22

the context.

23

Again, not relevant to the jurisdictional

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You are met with an

24

argument that it's all one ball of wax.

25

they merge; it's one enterprise.

Parent and sub,

And so if the subs do

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

8
1

something any place, the parent is -- it's all part of

2

one thing, so -- and I think that was the principal

3

argument made by the Respondents.

4

MR. FEDER:

Yes, Your Honor, and I would

5

say, again, when it comes to liability in Goodyear Tire

6

and Rubber, they'll be free to make that argument.

7

argument is not properly presented here.

8

made below.

9

That

It was never

It was never -- it was not made in the brief

10

in opposition to cert, so any argument for ignoring

11

corporate distinctions or an enterprise theory -- none

12

of that was made and, therefore, has been waived.

13

think that, secondly, as we indicated in our reply

14

brief -­

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I

We haven't resolved a whole

16

lot if we leave that question open, have we?

17

us to write an opinion that says, unless you -- unless

18

you ignore the separate corporate existence of the

19

subsidiary -- parenthesis, a question on which we

20

express no opinion, close parenthesis -- there can be no

21

jurisdiction in cases like this?

22

opinion that the world is waiting for?

23

MR. FEDER:

You want

Is that the kind of an

Well, Your Honor, I think that

24

actually in -- if the Court were to write that, it would

25

be left with the important general jurisdiction question
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

9
1

that the court below decided incorrectly, and

2

incorrectly in a few ways.
I think that, in fact, there would be

3
4

several ways for this Court to approach it, all of which

5

would actually help to clear up the law in this area.

6

think that even if one gets past the waiver point -- and

7

the reason the Court shouldn't get past the waiver point

8

is, among other things, because it wasn't raised -- we,

9

of course, had no opportunity to put in evidence that,

10

in fact, these corporations are run separately,

11

independent decision making, observation of corporate

12

form, and all the other things that would normally go

13

into it.

14

If you want to reach it, first of all, there

15

is -- even on the standards articulated in the

16

Respondents' brief, there's nothing in the record to

17

support it, and -­

18

I

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I thought you were saying

19

we should not even -- not even address the situation

20

where there is no special basis for ignoring the -- the

21

separate incorporation.

22

get into questions of whether, in fact, the subsidiary

23

was a sham -­

I -- of course, we should not

24

MR. FEDER:

Oh.

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

-- that there was control,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

10
1

all of that, but the simple question of whether, when

2

you have a totally owned subsidiary, its actions are

3

your actions.

4

MR. FEDER:

5

JUSTICE SCALIA:

6
7

That, I think, the Court -­
Don't we have to reach

that?
MR. FEDER:

You certainly do have to reach

8

that, Your Honor.

The Court has reached it and decided

9

it before, and has said that the mere parent-subsidiary

10

relationship does not create attribution one to the

11

other, most recently in Keeton, in which the Court cited

12

some of its older cases for that very proposition.

13

And I think that in -- another way to look

14

at it is, even if you wanted to treat the sales in North

15

Carolina as if they were made there directly by these

16

Petitioners -- in other words, even if you picked -­

17

assuming arguendo that you could attribute those sales

18

directly to the Petitioners and not, as the court below

19

found, treat them as not having been caused by them,

20

that does not come close to satisfying what is required

21

for general jurisdiction.

22

And, in particular, in going back to

23

Helicopteros and Gregory, just as the Rosenberg case was

24

binding in Helicopteros on the point that mere purchases

25

are not enough for general jurisdiction, here
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

11
1

Consolidated Textile v. Gregory is binding on the flip

2

side of that, which is that mere sales in the State are

3

not enough for general jurisdiction.

4

Even if Gregory weren't binding, I think

5

that you could look at Helicopteros and say there is no

6

real basis for a distinction between mere purchases and

7

mere sales.

8

point, and as well as a lot of case law from the time of

9

Gregory more generally requiring much more substantial

But, in fact, there is a case directly on

10

-- a substantial physical presence in the State.

11

terms of -- I think no personal jurisdiction argument

12

should go by without talking about International Shoe,

13

and if you look at just the International Shoe line of

14

cases, even aside from this issue of Gregory being

15

binding, the decision below is equally, if not more,

16

untenable.

17

In

International Shoe itself recognizes -- in

18

sort of carving out an area for what eventually came to

19

be called general jurisdiction, it recognizes the

20

extraordinary nature of the State power that we're

21

talking about when we talk about general jurisdiction,

22

which is this power to reach out and assert State power

23

over things that by hypothesis have no relationship to

24

contacts with the State.

25

language saying that you need continuous corporate

International Shoe uses the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

operations within the State and says that these

2

continuous corporate operations have to be so

3

substantial and of such a nature as to justify this

4

jurisdiction over conduct that is entirely unconnected

5

to the State.

6

The one case where the Court has upheld

7

general jurisdiction since International Shoe over a

8

corporation is Perkins, which was a case that involved

9

the corporation's principal place of business.

And in

10

Helicopteros, following Perkins, when the Court

11

articulated the standard there, the Court said that

12

we're looking to see whether there are contacts of the

13

sort that we found to exist in Perkins.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -­

But Perkins is kind of an

15

unusual case, because it was a company that at the time

16

was doing business only in Ohio.

17

mining company, and it was World War II, so the mines

18

couldn't be run.

19

was existing anywhere, it was in Ohio.

20

It was a Philippine

So to the extent that the corporation

MR. FEDER:

That's right, Your Honor, and I

21

guess what I would say about that is that it's

22

unusual -- those are unusual facts, but not unusual in

23

terms of what is required to be able to assert general

24

jurisdiction.

25

The Court in Keeton later described Perkins
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

13
1

as essentially involving the corporation's principal

2

place of business, and I think that's right because in

3

order for the State to be able to assert jurisdiction

4

over things unrelated to the State, you need that type

5

of relationship equivalent to a citizen or resident that

6

gives a State authority over the corporation's actions

7

worldwide and not just -- because this goes far beyond

8

specific jurisdiction where the State has a manifest

9

interest in an accident or a claim that arose in the

10
11

State or connected to the State.
Helicopteros, just to circle back on that

12

point, does say we're looking for contacts of the sort

13

found to exist in Perkins, and -- and as we said, said

14

that even $4 million in purchases were not enough.

15

think that all of those cases help to make it clear why

16

the mere sales here are not enough.

I

17

And if there are no further questions, I'd

18

like to reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN J. HORWICH,

22

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

23
24
25

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. HORWICH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

14
1

The North Carolina State court was wrong to

2

assert general personal jurisdiction over Petitioners,

3

extending potentially to any claim against them arising

4

out of any conduct of theirs anywhere in the world, and

5

there are several ways to see why that's wrong.

6

the Court were to accept the proposition that such

7

contacts with North Carolina as there are in the record

8

should be attributed to Petitioners, those contacts

9

still don't rise to the level of what this Court has -­

Even if

10

has demanded in terms of continuous and systematic

11

contacts.

12

And even setting those more -- those more

13

precedential tests aside, I think there's also a -- the

14

result of the North Carolina court's decision is that

15

the jurisdictional consequences here would be quite

16

disproportionate to the contacts that -- that -- on

17

which it would be based.

18

So if I can, I guess, turn for a moment to

19

the continuous and systematic contacts proposition,

20

which this Court has certainly not elaborated in its

21

case law, but I think it -- it would be -- I think it's

22

useful to speak of, of what exactly the Court was trying

23

to get at.

24

get at, particularly by -- as my friend referred to,

25

particularly by its reference in Helicopteros to Perkins

And what we think the Court was trying to

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

15
1

as -- as being sort of a benchmark for what continuous

2

and systematic contacts are, I think it requires seeing

3

an active volitional undertaking by the -- by the

4

defendant.

5

of third parties.

6

existing without interruption.

7

It can't be based on the contact -- conduct
Obviously, the continuous concept of

And with respect to systematic, we think

8

that that means there needs to be a plurality of

9

contacts, they have to be of different kinds or

10

qualities in a sense of perhaps employment as well as

11

contractual as well as regulatory as well as property as

12

well as sales or purchases, and that those contacts

13

together have to have some interrelationship that

14

results in something that might be thought of as more

15

than the sum of their parts.

16

And -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, suppose it's just a

17

corporation that's registered to do business in North

18

Carolina, and the connection with that registration -­

19

it says:

20

process for any and all claims.

21

I appoint so-and-so my agent to receive

MR. HORWICH:

Well, as -- as Mr. Feder

22

referred -- referred to, there -- there is a division in

23

the lower courts on whether that sort of a consent is

24

effective to permit the State general jurisdiction

25

over -- over the consenting party.
Alderson Reporting Company

That -- but the

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

Court has, I -- I think, been -- been fairly clear in -­

2

in setting notions of -- of formal consent to one side

3

when considering contacts-based cases.

4

this case, therefore, doesn't present that question, and

5

we don't have a position, as the Government, on that

6

today with respect to whether that's effective.

7

And so, in part,

But it certainly is the case that simply

8

because one entity in a Goodyear family of -- of related

9

corporations has consented, that somehow that consent

10

should extend to the entire enterprise.

And if I can

11

maybe take a minute to talk about where we think the

12

Respondents' view of -- of this enterprise jurisdiction

13

goes wrong, because we touched on it only -- only

14

briefly in our brief, which was, of course, filed before

15

theirs.

16

When -- when a court confronts a -- a set of

17

-- a corporate family, if you will, there seem to be two

18

principles that can be usefully applied in determining

19

the jurisdictional consequences of that relationship.

20

One is the alter ego concept, which certainly doesn't

21

seem to be supported on anything in the record here in

22

the sense that there's -- that there's no sound

23

suggestion in the record that -- that the European

24

entities were somehow a sham, that they didn't have any

25

separate existence, they were undercapitalized or any of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

17
1

the other indicia that you would see.

2

And so, to your point, Justice Scalia, I

3

think it is certainly something the Court could say that

4

the record here is no basis for that kind of a decision

5

to disregard the corporate separateness.

6

Then the other concept is the agency

7

concept.

And I think that may be what -- what

8

Respondents are placing somewhat greater reliance on.

9

And we certainly -- we certainly have the view that an

10

agent, acting on behalf of a principal within the scope

11

of its agency, can take actions that create contacts

12

with the jurisdiction that are, by virtue of the agency

13

relationship, attributable back to the principal.

14

But there are -- there are two important

15

things to realize, that that -- that that proposition is

16

somewhat modest in that, first of all, simply because

17

a -- a parent owns a subsidiary does not mean the

18

subsidiary is the parent's agent.

19

simply own subsidiaries as property or for various

20

business reasons.

21

automatically always acting as the agent of the parent

22

for all purposes or any at all.

23

Plenty of parents

It doesn't mean the subsidiary is

And -- and the second thing to be cautious

24

about in applying the agency principle is that the

25

agency relationship only runs one way; that is to say
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

18
1

the agent can do something that creates a contact on

2

behalf of the principal, but that's not to say that

3

everything the principal does in its independent

4

activities says anything about what contacts its agent

5

has.

That's exactly backwards.

6

In the -- and so, here the -- the allegation

7

actually in the complaint is that the European companies

8

are the agents of the parent -- of the -- of the

9

Goodyear U.S. entity.

That's -- that's paragraph 16 of

10

the complaint at page 112 of -- 122 of the joint

11

appendix.

12

an argument that something that the European

13

subsidiaries have done, say, in Turkey is something that

14

could be chargeable to the U.S. parent in a case where

15

it was relevant what the parent's relationship with

16

Turkey was.

17

So it -- it might be -- it -- there might be

But what Respondents are asking for here, in

18

effect, turns that completely around and suggests

19

implicitly that the -- the -- this -- the parent of the

20

Goodyear organization in the United States was somehow

21

doing the bidding, acting at the direction and control

22

of the European companies as principals.

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24

MR. HORWICH:

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Horwich -­
Yes.
Could I ask you a different

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

19
1

kind of question?

2

you a little bit far afield.

3

you about a particular sentence in your brief that seems

4

to have some relevance to -- not the general

5

jurisdiction question but some relevance to specific

6

jurisdiction.

7

And I apologize in advance for taking
But -- but I wanted to ask

So this is on page 20.

You say:

"If mere 'purposeful availment' of

8

commercial opportunities in a particular State" -- which

9

is, of course, the test for specific jurisdiction -- if

10

that purposeful availment "were sufficient to subject an

11

enterprise to the general jurisdiction of that State's

12

courts, a corporation that sold its goods to an

13

independent distributor, intending that they be resold

14

in all 50 States, could potentially be brought to

15

judgment in any State, on any claim against it."

16

So I -- I take that -- I understand that to

17

read that you think that it is purposeful availment that

18

subjects a company to specific jurisdiction -- not to

19

general jurisdiction, but to specific jurisdiction -- if

20

a corporation sold its goods to an independent

21

distributor intending that they be resold in all 50

22

States.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's at least one

other person in the courtroom who was hoping that, too.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I -- I was wondering why

than it would be in -- in the other case, and this --

16

I've been wondering that at the outset, and this

17

sentence that Justice Kagan points out brings that into

18

full focus.

19

MR. HORWICH:

Well, Justice Kennedy, let

20

me -- let me put it this way.

It -- it -- the

21

difference in our interest in the two cases is at bottom

22

just a difference in magnitude, but we think it's a

23

fairly significant difference in magnitude in the

24

sense -- in the sense that the jurisdictional

25

consequences of an assertion of general jurisdiction are

that -- with that one determination, it is the case that

2

that defendant can -- could potentially be brought to

3

judgment in a forum for all -- for claims arising from

4

any of its conduct anywhere in the world.

5

And specific jurisdiction by construction,

6

by its very nature, is only going to be a determination

7

-- whatever the contours of the specific rules that are

8

used, it's going to never be more than a determination

9

that jurisdiction in a claim, considering the

10

relationship between the defendant, the forum, and the

11

particular litigation, gives rise to jurisdiction.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

So, why -- why -- I mean,

13

you've heard the argument in the last case.

I mean, it

14

seemed that potentially can subject the smallest

15

manufacturer to liability throughout the world because

16

it uses the Internet.

what the foreign policy -- you've heard treaties

Do you want to say anything?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

MR. HORWICH:

21

(Laughter.)

22

MR. HORWICH:

Yes.

And briefly.

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

The -- the -- the brief answer

23

is that the Internet questions, in particular, are so

24

complicated and, indeed, so potentially far-reaching

25

that in a case that presented them, our interest might

And -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I think there's something

19

very new about this, because general jurisdiction is

20

all-purpose jurisdiction, and for a corporation it's

21

sort of like a residence for an individual.

22

Feder was making that point.

23

I think Mr.

What's -- what's troubling here is that the

24

North Carolina court seems to be blending the two

25

together:

specific jurisdiction based on the claim
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

23
1

arising in the forum, and general jurisdiction with a

2

claim that has nothing to do with the forum, and its

3

insertion of jurisdiction over any and all claims.

4

I do not know of any case post-International Shoe -- the

5

only thing that we have is Perkins v. Benguet.

6

And

Is there -- is there any case in which this

7

Court has sanctioned the assertion of general

8

jurisdiction based on some prior -- some product coming

9

into the State, not the product that caused the injury

10
11

abroad?

I don't know of any case.
MS. PEDDIE:

Your Honor, if that's -- if

12

that's the characterization of the case and that's all

13

you had, then there wouldn't be a case.

14

here, and I think the -- what the -- what the evidence

15

in this case bears out is that is not the case here.

16

The characterization of the case by both the Government

17

and by Petitioners is that there is simply mere sales

18

here, and they ignore how the sales occurred.

Our argument

19

Our focus is on how the sales occurred, and

20

I think Justice Scalia made a -- a correct distinction,

21

that what we're doing here is not talking about

22

attribution, that -- that sort of thing, and -- and

23

simply saying that because someone down the line sold

24

them, without any other discussion, there's general

25

jurisdiction.

That's not correct.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, then, you don't

defend the reasoning of the State supreme court?

3

MS. PEDDIE:

I think that the -- the State

4

supreme court did a lot of things right, but, as we say

5

in the brief, we think that they took a detour in using

6

inappropriate stream-of-commerce language that isn't

7

there.

8

For example, the Petitioners have changed their tune

9

here.

It's not that they didn't have help doing it.

They talked routinely about purposeful availment

10

in their briefs to the court of appeals and to the

11

supreme court.

12

requests that they -- that they find purposeful

13

availment here.

14

For example, page 327 of their brief

So the court had a lot of help.

But that part of the opinion we don't really

15

think is appropriate, nor is it necessary.

16

that I'm making about there being nothing new is that

17

there is ample evidence in this case to apply to the

18

general jurisdiction principles that were used in

19

Perkins and used in Hall and that can cause this Court

20

to reach the correct result.

21

The point

As the Court is well aware, this Court can

22

affirm on any basis supported in the record, and we

23

believe that there is a basis in well-established rules

24

supported in the record, whether it agrees with the

25

court of appeals' decision or not.

15

MS. PEDDIE:

Your Honor, as far back as -­

16

as Burger King, this Court recognized that commercial

17

activities, when they're conducted on behalf of an

18

out-of-State party, can sometimes be attributed.

19

the Solicitor General agrees that there's a different

20

jurisdictional analysis that may apply over and above

21

something like Cannon or Rush v. Savchuk, if there are

22

case-specific interactions between particular affiliated

23

corporations as you have here.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

is not talking about general jurisdiction.

MS. PEDDIE:

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, no, but -­
It's talking about specific

jurisdiction.

4

MS. PEDDIE:

But what they're talking about

5

are that there are evidentiary case-specific

6

interactions between the parties that would lead to the

7

conclusion of general jurisdiction and thus subjecting

8

them to suit on -- in dispute-blind -- or dispute-blind

9

jurisdiction.

10

In addition, this Court has used in a

11

variety of other areas a unitary business principle for

12

local taxation in Mobil.

13

years ago, the Hague Convention, our trade partners that

14

are complained of here, talked about the fact that

15

using -- attributing contacts or counting contacts that

16

were based on conduct performed by others was

17

appropriate and was not really a sticking point and that

18

they were perfectly content to leave that to other

cases.

MS. PEDDIE:

In this case I think

3

it's the part -- and, frankly, we'll use the Solicitor

4

General's definition of a system, from their brief at -­

5

at page 23, where they talked about conduct that forms a

6

system and aggregation of objects united by some form of

7

regular activity or interdependent.

8
9

Using their definition, I think you ask the
question:

Is a defendant part of a continuous business

10

system or enterprise that conducts general business

11

activities in the forum?

was our position below.

But even the Solicitor

Well, the question isn't

whether they did that; the question is whether it was
right to do that.

11

MS. PEDDIE:

That -- that's -­

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, you don't make your

13

point by saying that the court of appeals made a

14

mistake.

15

MS. PEDDIE:

No, no.

But I think -- I think

16

what -- what -- at least as I understood her question -­

17

and I may have misunderstood her question -- was is

18

there anything in the record where -- where they had

19

done that.

20

part and parcel of the fact findings that the trial

21

court made about the existence of a highly integrated

22

supply and distribution system in the -- that operates

23

in the State.

24
25

I think the -- the evidence in the record is

The number of tires, for example, that
Petitioners manufactured in North Carolina was

system.

On the

It was an internal distribution

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, I mean, those

arrangements could exist with a lot of distributors.

10

You don't want to ship a distributor stuff that the

11

distributor is not going to be using.

12

MS. PEDDIE:

Your Honor, I think -­

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I mean, my goodness.

The

14

fact that you coordinate with your distributor how much

15

of your product you're going to ship to him doesn't -­

16

doesn't really show -­

17

MS. PEDDIE:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

19
20

Your Honor -­
-- that you are a unitary

business with your distributor.
MS. PEDDIE:

Your Honor, I think this goes

21

way beyond coordination.

For example, Mr. Kramer

22

testified that, quote, "Their job is just to be given a

23

forecast or a ticket, and then they just build widgets."

24

That's all they do.

25

their solicitation and their production was solely based

They were complete -- their -­

30

on the control and the requests from the parent.

2

requests, as he testified, quote, "emanate from the

3

requests that Goodyear would make."

4

and supply system was the same for all of them.

5

The

And the production

On the distribution side, the testimony was

even more -- I think was even more limited in that he

said the plant in Turkey doesn't control any

9

States without the approval and sanction of the parent,

10
11

They wouldn't send anything into United

and anything else, quote, "just doesn't happen."
So this was a closed system.

It was

12

dominated by -- by the Goodyear parent, and there wasn't

13

a question of coordination.

14

unless the parent told them to; they sent it where the

15

parent said they should send it to; and when it got to

16

the United States, the testimony is, is that the parent

17

controlled it at that point.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It was they didn't produce

But the "it" wasn't the

19

product that caused the injury here.

20

the case, the tire that allegedly caused this bus to

22

markets, not the U.S. market.

23

MS. PEDDIE:

As I understand

The Goodyear Regional RHS tire

24

that was on the bus and that failed was not generally

25

designed for the U.S. market, although it was brought

2

The tires we're talking about are of three

kinds.

5

second -- a second category are tires that were sold as

original equipment on cars and buses; and, third, and

that case, it was purchases; and in this case, it's

sales.

15

there's no general jurisdiction.

16

different?

17

And in the purchaser case, certainly we said no,

MS. PEDDIE:

Why should it be any

I think the distinction between

18

Hall and Perkins is not so much purchases and sales,

19

it's which contacts do you count?

20

is sort of forgotten in Hall is the language that they

21

talk about -- you needed to have the same general

22

business contacts that you had in Perkins.

23

And the language that

I think the difference is, is that purchases

24

are sort of a one-shot deal.

They may be supplies,

25

but -- but they're more irregular, but the core business
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

32

is selling -- is selling items, and so sales count more

2

than purchases.

I apologize for interrupting.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In Perkins, it was the

because of the war.

There was no other at the

So there was only one place.

of that case are -- is that one officer of the

10

corporation came home, and he was -- he maintained

JUSTICE GINSBURG:
the corporation.

He was the president of

He was the president of the

corporation.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And whatever business it

was doing, it was doing from that office in Ohio.
MS. PEDDIE:

Right.

And the Court

19

characterized that -- I think there's a difference

20

between what the Court did in Perkins and how it was

21

described in Keeton.

22

Petitioners have used.

23

That's the language that the

But the language that the Court used in

24

Perkins was that the decision was based on the

25

supervisory activities; not the fact that it was the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

33
1

principal place of business, but the fact that the

2

supervision over, for example, the renovation of the

3

factory after the war took place in the forum.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you about the

5

ramifications of your theory that there's general

6

jurisdiction in North Carolina over these three

7

subsidiaries?

8
9

Suppose that one of the children on a bus
was a Canadian citizen, was going home to Canada.

And

10

had the idea that juries in North Carolina are more

11

liberal than in France.

12

jury in France, but -- so could the Canadian come and

13

sue because there's general jurisdiction in the United

14

States?

15

MS. PEDDIE:

Well, there wouldn't be any

I think it would depend upon a

16

lot of factors, Your Honor.

17

there's -- it's established that there's general

18

jurisdiction there, or are we in the same fact pattern

19

as here?

20

Are you assuming that

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

No, you -- we're talking

21

about Goodyear and these three subsidiaries.

22

there's general jurisdiction in North Carolina.

23

companies can be sued on any and all claims.

24
25

So my question is:

You say
Those

Could anyone on that bus

that turned over in Paris come to North Carolina to
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

34
1

bring the wrongful death, or whatever, suit?

2

MS. PEDDIE:

I think -- I think, in theory,

3

they could; I think, in practice, the case would never

4

stay there because of the controls that we talked about

5

on forum shopping; about, particularly, forum non

6

conveniens.

7

we made is one may want to consider for due -- for due

8

process purposes the residence of the plaintiff.

9

fair, for example, to have a case in North Carolina

One of the suggestions, for example, that

Is it

10

where the plaintiff doesn't live in North Carolina, as

11

they do here, but lives in Canada?

12

So that's -- that's one limitation.

And as

13

this Court said in the Sinochem case, you can look at

14

the forum non conveniens issue before you look at the

15

jurisdictional issue.

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's an -- that's

17

an odd way to think about general jurisdiction.

18

jurisdiction is principally status -- your residence,

19

the principal place of business, the place of

20

incorporation.

21

mentioning are -- in fact, some of the factors you

22

mention in the brief are quite different than that.

23

General

And this -- these factors that you're

MS. PEDDIE:

Your Honor, I think if -- if

24

the limitation -- if the Court's view is basically the

25

Petitioners', that you are limited to principal place of
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35

business, State of incorporation, and physical presence,

2

which we don't think is the state of the law, and,

3

frankly, if it were the state of the law, then we would

4

have a Hague Convention now and it wouldn't have taken

5

20 years to negotiate.

6

If -- if that's the position that the Court

7

is taking, then I don't think that -- you know, that

8

this case represents something different.

9

the state of the law is that -- or at least the

I think that

10

professed state of the law is that it is based on

11

continuous and systematic contacts.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Ms. Peddie, let's assume

13

that you're right, that on some level that some -- that

14

it's not just the place of incorporation or the

15

principal place of business, that it could be created by

16

something more.

17

Goodyear USA, so your adversary is right that what

18

you're asking us to do is sort of a reverse

19

principal-agent.

20

The only something more here is

You're saying that the subsidiary has used

21

the principal, its owner, as its agent.

really -- that's the core problem with your argument,

isn't it?

4

what we're talking about is not so much attribution as

more of a merger or a joint activity.

is that there is a system, by the Solicitor General's

law, but you would want identical treatment as a matter

2

of jurisdiction?

3

MS. PEDDIE:

Right.

They have very -- in

4

most States, frankly, there's a -- a lesser requirement

5

for the exercise of jurisdiction, merely allowing the

6

suit to go forward, than there is for actual imputation

7

of liability or imposition of liability, and so North

8

Carolina, I think, is a very good example of that.

9

They have a fairly liberal requirement or

10

state of the law that we've cited in the Manley case,

11

where general personal jurisdiction exists over a

12

foreign corporation where it is controlled by or

13

controls a local corporation.

Is that it?
Yes.

That -- I mean, we -- I

22

think you have to understand that this case is at a very

23

embryonic state.

24

This was a -- an appeal, an interlocutory appeal from

So we've not had an opportunity to develop the facts.

We hope we will be able to develop those

facts, but what we're faced with here is a situation

5

where North Carolina would permit the exercise of

6

jurisdiction under its well-established law on general

7

personal jurisdiction, but when it comes to the

imposition of liability for substantive purposes, that

may be a much, much -- much tougher sledding.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you have any case law

13

that supports your position, which, I take it -- and

14

correct me if I've got it wrong -- that a subsidiary is

15

subject to jurisdiction wherever the parent is, so long

16

as some products made by the subsidiary are shipped by

17

the parent to the -- to buyers in the forum State?

18

MS. PEDDIE:

No, Your Honor, because that's

19

not our position here.

Our position is that if you

20

participate in this kind -- not a general one, but in

21

this kind of very tightly controlled system,

22

distribution and supply system, then there is general

23

jurisdiction in the forum over the foreign subsidiary

24

that participates in this.

25

But simply generally having

the forum, that's not what we're contending.

2

frankly, I don't think that that would be a situation in

3

which general jurisdiction would apply.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And,

I see nothing in the

5

North Carolina court's opinion that explains that this

6

is the -- this is a corporation where we can obliterate

7

the distinction between parent and sub.

9

MS. PEDDIE:

Your Honor, they do talk

repeatedly about the existence of this highly integrated

10

distribution system.

11

sort of flip it over and say what would happen if we

12

adopted the Petitioners' view that you ignore the

13

system, and all you look at is a -- is a few sales.

14

think that then you would end up with a situation that

15

would be unfair to the State of North Carolina in terms

16

of providing a forum for its residents.

17

I think it might be helpful to

I

For example, if I may give a hypothetical,

18

if you have a -- not a manufacturing plant in Turkey,

19

but, let's say, in China that is producing a massive

20

amount of tires for importation into the United States,

21

thousands of tires, in this same distribution system.

Based on their view that it has to be principal place of

23

business, State of incorporation, and that mere sales

24

are not -- don't count, and it has the same jurisdiction

we felt the need to -- to respond to the policy

arguments of not just the Government but also to the

12

I would -- I would say, let me -- if I might

under -- under accepted notions of what a sovereign can

MS. PEDDIE:

there's nothing unfair about -- about subjecting them to

MR. FEDER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

The purported integrated distribution that

6

Respondents are pointing to as the basis for ignoring

7

the corporate separation here, whatever else you could

fraction of Petitioners' business that involved tires

So -- where they didn't normally market

their products, and so, of course, everything that they

sent to the United States was only when the U.S.

under any theory of which I'm aware, even the most
