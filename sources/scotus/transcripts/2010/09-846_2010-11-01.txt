Mr. Yang.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANTHONY YANG

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. YANG:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This Court in Keene held that section 1500

11
12

of Title 28 deprives the Court Of Federal Claims has

13

jurisdiction when the plaintiff has a pending suit in

14

another court based on substantially the same operative

15

facts and left open the question whether some overlap in

16

the relief requested is also necessary to trigger that

17

bar.

18

1500 applies when both suits -- only when both suits

19

seek the same relief, and that the critical distinction

20

in this regard is whether the particular relief in the

21

plaintiff's plea for relief is deemed legal or

22

equitable.

23

The Federal Circuit erred in holding that section

Section 1500's text broadly bars CFC

24

jurisdiction whenever any suit that the plaintiff has

25

pending in any other court is a suit for the CFC claim
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

or is merely a suit in respect to that claim.

In other

2

words, another suit for a different but a related claim

3

will trigger section 1500.

4

That provision was intended to protect the

5

government from simultaneous duplicative suits against

6

the United States and its agents by forcing plaintiffs

7

to elect between those related suits.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you recognize that

sequential suits could be brought.

So that if the case

10

in the district court went to final judgment, then it

11

would be okay to go to the Court Of Federal Claims.

12

MR. YANG:

That is correct.

In some, in

13

perhaps a good number of cases, it's possible to, if you

14

are seasonably prompt in your Court Of Federal Claims

15

case or your district court case first -­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you don't have

17

control over how long the district court case is going

18

to take, and there is no mechanism to stop the running

19

of the statute of limitations.

20

MR. YANG:

Well, I think there is some

21

control that you can exercise over the -- how promptly

22

the suit proceeds.

23

suits against the government, many suits proceed on an

24

administrative record and go directly to summary

25

judgment; that can be done in a relatively prompt

Particularly if we are talking about

Alderson Reporting Company

manner.

2

But even if not, the Congress that enacted

3

section 1500 in 1868 knew that essentially what it was

4

doing in many, many cases would prevent a second suit

5

from going forward.

6

concerned with the cotton claimants.

7

claimants had authorization to bring suit in the Court

8

of Claims, but there was a two-year statute of

9

limitations.

That's because the Congress was
The cotton

That statute ran from the end of the Civil

10

War.

And this Court in a case called U.S. v. Anderson

11

at 76 U.S., and the relevant pages are 70 to 71, made

12

clear that the end of the Civil War for the purposes of

13

that statute was August in 1866.
Congress enacted section 1500 in June of

14
15

1868.

There was a two-month window, if that, to bring

16

suit and Congress recognized, it would have recognized,

17

that if you filed suit or were forced to elect at that

18

point, that would be the end of the game.
There was also another statutory provision

19
20

that Congress enacted during the Civil War that put a

21

two-year statute of limitations on suits against

22

officers.

23

Mitchell v. Clark, 110 U.S. 633 at pages 641 and 642.

24
25

That was discussed in this Court's decision,

So given the time at which Congress was
enacting section 1500, it knew it was putting plaintiffs
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to a very hard choice.

You had to elect between the

2

Court Of Federal Claims remedy and between a remedy in

3

another court against an officer.

4

likely be the end of the game.

5

a very particular way.

6

that limited the authority of the court that had its

7

hands on the purse strings of the Federal Government,

8

and that performed the very function that Congress just

9

a few years earlier had itself exercised through the

That remedy would

And Congress did that in

It did it in a targeted statute

10

enactment of private bills through its appropriations

11

power.
So section 1500 ultimately states in essence

12
13

that if you are going to bring suit in this specialized

14

court where Congress has vested the Court of Claims with

15

the very special power of distributing money from the

16

Federal fisc, that you could only bring one suit arising

17

from the same operative facts in order to be in that

18

court.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In the cotton cases, why

Congress was concerned with ensuring that a claimant

24

didn't get double-recovered in two different suits.

2

you know, you've got people suing in different

3

jurisdictions over getting the same pot of money or

4

something close to it.

5

simply you can't have two suits that are seeking the

6

same pot?
MR. YANG:

7

Why isn't our view of 1500 just

Well, it wasn't the same pot of

8

money.

Collection Act -- we will call it APCA -- provided for a

10

special statutory trust remedy.

that might have resulted from cotton.

14

were paid but ultimately didn't make their way into the

15

fisc, you got nothing or you got a substantially reduced

16

fund.

as we explained in our reply brief, under certain

18

doctrines that would give you the property in specie, or

19

you could seek monetary relief.

That's not so in -- in the cotton cases.
MR. YANG:

11

You may in certain instances.

12

But particularly in the cotton cases, Congress knew that

13

it -- what it was doing was forcing one path and only

14

one path.

15

had to choose and you not -- you weren't going to have

16

time to bring another suit, and Congress would have

17

known that when it enacted the section 1500's

18

predecessor two months before the statute ran in APCA

19

and perhaps after the statute ran for bringing a tort

20

suit against officials under the cases -- the statute

21

that this Court construed in Mitchell.

It wasn't about duplicative recovery.

You

22

So it wasn't simply that duplicative relief

23

was at issue, Congress was actually forcing you to make

24

a choice in cases where the types of relief are quite

25

different.

And the type of relief, for instance, that
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

you would get in a suit against an agent of the United

2

States, what you get out of that suit is not a pot of

3

money; the court does not say at the end of the case,

4

here you go, you asked for $1,000, here it is.

5

court enters an order; it enters a judgment.

6

"Defendant, perhaps Tony Yang, officer of the

7

government, you pay $100 million, $50 million."

It says,

It doesn't mean much to the plaintiff if

they get at Tony Yang as an individual.

This is very

10

different relief than a money judgment against the

11

United States.

12

we don't normally think of a claim as embodying a

13

particular type of relief, which is the submission of

14

the trial here.

It's not the same relief.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And in fact,

but if you had, for instance, obtained damages against

brought suit within the Abandoned -- Abandoned Property

The complaints here are -- they have the

as the Tribe submits.

20

The Tribe not only seeks an accounting, but

This is

It goes on to say that the tribe is not only

21

entitled to object and essentially challenge the

22

accounting, but it's entitled to any other equitable

23

relief that might be appropriate in light of the -- the

24

court's decision in the case.

25

So the tribe is in no way trying in the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

district court simply to seek an accounting.

2

in the Court of Federal Claims, it's not simply looking

3

to what they claim to be new money.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MR. YANG:

That's correct, but if you have a

10

claim, for instance -- taking the old money/new money

11

framework, which we don't think is borne out by the

12

complaints, but even if we were correct, if they were

13

seeking so-called old money in district court -- that

14

is, money that should have been there, but was

15

improperly allocated and therefore didn't show up in

16

their account -- they could also bring a claim under the

17

Indian Tucker Act claiming that there was some breach of

18

duty under a statute or regulation, clear and -- this is

19

a Navajo Nation-type question -- and you could get an

20

accounting through -- in order to determine the proper

21

amount that should be there.

22

So this is a way -- the problem that we have

23

here, particularly in these cases where there's an

24

allegation of 100 years of trust duties going back, and

25

simultaneously litigating these cases in courts that

So what are they supposed to do?
MR. YANG:

There is no question that section

1500 may put a plaintiff at a difficult choice.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. YANG:

10
11

That's a big choice.

It's a choice that has existed

since 1868, when Congress -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

To test that choice -­

12

it's pretty stark in the Casman case, where Congress

13

said back pay is for the Claims Court, reinstatement for

14

the district court.

15

But your position is that under your reading

16

of Casman -- let's forget about Congress's amendment.

17

Under your reading of the statute, the Casman decision

18

was wrong and the plaintiff had to choose either back

19

pay or reinstatement; there was no way to get both.

20

MR. YANG:

That's correct.

And I think that

21

was this Court's suggestion at the end of Keene, when

22

the Court recognized that because there are complicated

23

jurisdictional regimes that apply when you sue the

24

government, the Court explained there may well be

25

situations where this precludes a plaintiff from seeking

1

all the relief that you would otherwise be able to get

2

if you could bring suit separately.
And the Court in Keene said:

3

Look, if there

4

is apparent hardship -- this is following its decision

5

in Corona Coal, which is 1924.

6

in the statute, it is a question that must be directed

7

to Congress, because Congress is the one that set this

8

up, this jurisdictional limit.

9

limit that existed in 1868, remember, was a very

10

If there is a hardship

And the jurisdictional

difficult choice.
JUSTICE BREYER:

11

Your basic point is this:

12

You're just saying it's too bad, go to Congress.

13

you don't deny the basic point, which is that an Indian

14

tribe may think the Bureau of Indian Affairs has really

15

mismanaged everything and what they would like is some

16

money, and also they want an injunction so they won't do

17

it again.

18

But

And now your view is, it's true, there is no

19

way they can get that, because they have to go to two

20

different courts, and really in your view they can't go

21

to two different courts, period.

22

MR. YANG:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

Well, let me qualify -­
And hardship is definite.

It's just you are saying, that's what Congress wanted.
MR. YANG:

The hardship may be there.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why isn't it just as bad as

what I just said?
MR. YANG:

Because you might be able to

bring, for instance, an APA suit that completes before

7

the six-year statute of limitations ends.

8

we don't think that that's an unusual thing, for an APA

action to be brought promptly, even with an appeal.

MR. YANG:

3

Well, but that's precisely what

they are seeking to do here, and we just disagree

5

whether that relief is available in district court.

6

the question here is whether you can simultaneously

pursue it.

Let me be clear.

And

These cases in our view

should almost all be brought normally in the Court of

Claims should address.

These cases are seeking money for past

However, a number of plaintiffs like to try

14

their hand at more than one court and they bring

15

simultaneous suits, just as Tucker -- the cotton

16

claimants did in the 1860's, where Congress provided for

17

a general statute, very broadly worded.

18

any claim for and in respect to which any suit or

19

process is pending in any other court against the U.S.

20

or any person acting or professing to act as its agents.

21

It's a very broad statute.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It applies to

It's not -- I mean,

23

you are putting a pejorative spin on what they are

doing, saying, you know, many plaintiffs like to take a

chance in more than one court.

But your response to

you have to choose between injunctive relief or damages.

MR. YANG:

to Congress, and when Congress addressed the question it

Court of Claims.

11

12

we think particular hardship would be had, because the

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So why isn't our rule

16

simply -- what is so wrong with a rule that says if you

17

can bring it in the Court of Claims you have to, but if

18

there's relief that you can't secure there you can have

19

two lawsuits?

What is so irrational about that?

20

MR. YANG:

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22
23

Well, that doesn't square -­
If there is no double

recovery possible.
MR. YANG:

But that doesn't square even with

the history of what Congress is trying to target.

25

relief that was available in the Court of Claims in the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We have already gone

through that because most of those claims would have had

some element of double recovery, that might have

precluded a second action.

if there is a chance of potential double recovery, you

can't breach, what's wrong with that?

9

MR. YANG:

The point that I raised was

I don't think it squares with the

10

text of the statute, which is broader than, doesn't

11

provide for a claim, it doesn't provide for relief, it

12

doesn't speak to double recovery.

done so in a much direct manner.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. SPINELLI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Two suits are for or in respect to the same

24

claim under Section 1500, only if they stem from the

25

same operative facts and seek duplicative relief.
24
Alderson Reporting Company

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in response to the Government's argument, I would like

2

to explain why that's the best reading of Section 1500's

3

text, as well as the only reading that harmonizes

4

Section 1500 with the overall jurisdictional and

5

remedial scheme.
Congress has made a broad range of remedies

6
7

available to Plaintiffs wronged by the Government.

8

it's directed Plaintiffs to seek certain remedies only

9

in the Court of Federal Claims, and certain remedies

10

And

only in the district court.
The Government's reading of Section 1500

11
12

assumes that Congress intended to penalize Plaintiffs

13

for following that direction by barring them from the

14

only forum where they can obtain money damages.

15

nothing in the statute's text or history suggests that

16

Congress intended to create such a nonsensical scheme.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

17

But

Your argument assumes that

18

there is available in the district courts injunctive

19

relief under the Administrative Procedure Act, and that

20

is far from clear, even after Bowen, it's far from clear

21

if you had any business being in the district court

22

anyway.

23

question, that is if as is not clear, you have a right

24

to sue in the district courts for an injunction, can

25

that suit proceed because of 1500 when there is a suit

And so in a way we are resolving a very strange

25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

pending in the Court of Claims and that is sort of an

2

abstract question.
MS. SPINELLI:

3

Justice Scalia, it is

4

disputed whether or not the district court has

5

jurisdiction to entertain the Nation's claims there.

6

The Government has a move to dismiss on that ground,

7

that motion is pending.

8

district court's jurisdiction over the claims raised in

9

the district court is a question that this Court needs

We don't believe that the

10

to face.

Rather, the question here is whether the Court

11

of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over the claims

12

brought in the CFC.

13

district court has jurisdiction, but on whether

14

duplicative relief is sought in both suits.

And that turns not on whether the

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

The main thrust that I was

16

raising was does this really get the Tribe into trouble?

17

They have to forego one kind of relief for another.

18

what about injunctive relief, that's what he thought of,

19

and Justice Scalia raises the point, well, they are not

20

going to be entitled to injunctive relief anyway because

21

the APA doesn't provide it, if I understand that

22

correctly.

giving up the null set.

24
25

So you are giving up the null set.

MS. SPINELLI:
Justice Breyer.

So

You were

No, not at all,

First of all, we would contest that we
26
Alderson Reporting Company

are not entitled to the relief that the Nation sought in

2

the district court.

3

entitled to that relief.

We believe that the Nation is

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MS. SPINELLI:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

But it couldn't get that?
Correct.
It couldn't get that kind

of relief in the Court of Claims?

8

MS. SPINELLI:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:
MS. SPINELLI:

10

Correct.
Yes, it could.
No, no, no.

You are right

11

that it could not.

The relief that is being sought in

12

the district court is primarily an accounting.

13

accounting is inherently an equitable remedy, a remedy

14

that under trust law the trustee owes to the beneficiary

15

to provide the beneficiary with all the information

16

necessary for him to protect his rights.

17

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

An

Isn't it well established

18

that part of the jurisdiction of the equity court when

19

it requires an accounting is to give damages for breach

20

of the trustee's duty?

That's Hornbook.

MS. SPINELLI:

21

That may well be the case,

22

Justice Kennedy, in common law trust suits.

23

requested -­

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

No.

That wasn't

No, I'm talking about
Historically in equity the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

trustee who breaches the trustee's duty in the equity

2

court is required to give damages.
MS. SPINELLI:

3
4

You are correct that

normally, that in the past -­

5

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

6

not common law, it's equity.
MS. SPINELLI:

7

It's not common law, it's
It's old law, it's equity.

Correct.

You are correct

8

that in the days of the divided bench suit for breach of

9

trust were brought in equity.

I don't think we need to

10

parse that finely here, because the question here is

11

whether or not the Tribe has sought duplicative relief

12

in both courts.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

Isn't that unrealistic?

14

You don't want an accounting for the sake of having an

15

accounting so that you can put the accounting in your

16

desk.

17

You want to get the $1,000,000,000.

18

directed at the same object, and it is fanciful to think

19

there is this separate suit for an accounting.

20

object of that suit is the same thing as the object of

21

the suit in the Court of Claims.

22

Oh, look it, they stole $1,000,000,000 from us.

MS. SPINELLI:

If the suits are

The

With respect, Justice Scalia,

23

that is not the case.

The accounting has enormous

24

benefit entirely apart from any monetary relief that it

25

might ultimately lead to.

The Nation, as well as other
28

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

tribes who have brought these kinds of suits, lack basic

2

information about what they own, what the metes and

3

bounds of their lands are, what leases have been

4

granted, how long they last, what easements and rights

5

of way have been granted over their land, what the

6

status is of their mineral rights and timber rights.

7

All of this is information that the Tribe needs and that

8

Congress recognized in the Indian Trust Fund Management

9

Reform Act that the Tribe needs in order to exercise its

10

Federally granted right to decide how it's assets are

11

best managed, and the longer that that accounting is

12

delayed, the more the Nation is harmed by the inability

13

to do that, the inability to decide whether certain

14

funds should be withdrawn from trusts held by the United

15

States, the inability to decide whether it should bring

16

claims against third-parties.

17

the accounting that's entirely separate from any

18

monetary relief.

19

20

Claims has long held that it lacks jurisdiction to grant

that kind of pre-liability historical accounting.

So there's real value to

judgment.

Despite the similar terminology, they are not

at all the same.

sought in the district court is a remedy by itself.

12

It's a remedy that the beneficiary is entitled to once

13

its received or denied, that's a final order that can be

appealed.

15

An accounting of the type that's being

It's a

16

remedy, but is it terribly different from what the

17

accounting the Court of Federal Claims would order to

18

figure out how much -­

19

MS. SPINELLI:

It is because it requires the

20

trustee to provide all information about the trust that

21

might be relevant to the beneficiary, and it does so

22

without requiring the beneficiary to prove any

23

mismanagement.

It's a little bit more

20

complicated than that because prior to -- prior to the

Court of Federal Claims in its current incarnation,

22

certain claims for an accounting could have been brought

23

before the Indian Claims Commission, but -- I mean

that's going a little far afield.

don't you get -- you aren't you asking for compensation

18

for losses and injuries from the commingling or the

19

misappropriation of assets?

20

MS. SPINELLI:

No, Justice Kennedy, in the

21

Court of Federal Claims, as a close reading of the

22

complaint will show, the Nation is requesting four

23

specific kinds of relief.

24

from the United States' failure to lease its mineral

25

rights for fair market value.

First it's asking for damages

That's count 1.

32
Alderson Reporting Company

Count 2

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is seeking damages from the United States' failure to

2

obtain fair market value for leases of its land.

3

3 is seeking damages from the United States' failure to

4

invest judgment funds in a timely way and to obtain the

5

maximum interest rate; and count 4 asserts a similar

6

claim for damages with respect to the trust fund.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

Count

But your brief makes the

8

-- seems to make the point that that's all just interest

9

on capital.

It's not for lost capital.

But even as you

10

described it, it sounds to me that you get damages for

11

loss of capital plus interest.
MS. SPINELLI:

12

It's -- it's not just

13

interest, you are correct.

14

example this will make things a little bit clearer.

15

that the government sold a stand of timber belonging to

16

the Nation for $20, even though the stand of timber was

17

worth $40.

18

$10.

19

I mean, maybe if I give an

It then deposited it into the trust account,

The suit in the district court seeks an

20

accounting and a restatement of the accounts and to the

21

extent appropriate and available, equitable restitution

22

of the $10 that was missing from the account.

23

The suit in the CFC seeks to recover the $20

24

that the United States should have earned, had it acted

25

as a prudent fiduciary when it was selling the stand of
33
Alderson Reporting Company

timber.

And the Nation is entitled to both sums of

2

money, but they are different, and because the money

3

sought in the two courts is different, the relief is not

4

duplicative.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

My problem is that I read

6

the CFC complaint as including both.

7

at it.

9

And I intruded on Justice Breyer's question.
JUSTICE BREYER:

8

I will take a look

What I'm trying to work out

still in my mind, is if you say, look, Indian Tribe:

10

You have to go to the court of claims, period.

11

You can't go to these other courts, I mean unless you

12

give up the court of claims.

13

to really lose something it needs?

Is the Indian Tribe going

realize that.

about -­

20

MS. SPINELLI:

Yes.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MS. SPINELLI:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- is in section 2 -­
I apologize.
-- of 1491 there is a

24

sentence which says, about the court of claims, in any

25

case including the 1505 Tucker Act, the court shall have

Alderson Reporting Company

the power to remand appropriate matters to any

administrative or executive body or official with such

direction as it is may deem proper and just.
Now that seems awfully broad, so I'm

thinking now, if they want money, they can get the money

from the court of claims.

8

the executive branch to behave the way we think they

Now

what's -- I want to know the response.
MS. SPINELLI:

13

Justice Breyer, you're -- you

14

are exactly right about what 1491(a)(2) provides, but it

15

also provides that any such relief can be ordered only

16

as an incident of and collateral to a judgment of a

17

claim of which the Court of Federal Claims otherwise has

jurisdiction.

government thinks that in the Casman case there was a

20

choice, you can sue for reinstatement in the district

court, you can sue for back pay in the claims court, but

22

you cannot get both.

23

that's what was happening, Congress did not adopt a

24

two -- didn't bless the two-state -- two court solution.

25

Congress said, there will be one lawsuit.

And when Congress realized that

MS. SPINELLI:

5

With respect,

6

Justice Ginsburg, I would disagree.

I think that action

7

by Congress in the 1972 Remand Act strongly supports the

8

conclusion that Congress has implicitly acquiesced in

this construction of section 1500.
Congress -- you are right, Congress decided

change to the statute to cast the holding into doubt,

courts, one can pursue them by bringing simultaneous

20

suits in the two different courts.

No, but if they were just

know, you can do either one.

13

MS. SPINELLI:

Well, I mean, clearly the

14

easier path is to have one suit.

15

plaintiff wants to be forced to bring two suits to

16

obtain two different remedies, both of which it needs,

17

at double the expense and, you know, double the anxiety.

18

I don't think any

But I think what's significant about the

19

1972 action is that Congress did absolutely nothing to

20

suggest that it disagreed with the Casman holding.

21

the same is true in 1982, when Congress completely

22

revamped the entire jurisdictional scheme, changed the

23

jurisdiction of the claims court very much, and yet left

section 1500 entirely untouched.

word, as I think this Court said in Keene, is the word

2

"claim."

3

"Claim" can mean a lot of different things.

4

It can sometimes mean the set of operative facts from

5

which a right to relief arises, which I believe is at

6

least implicitly what the government is saying.

7

also mean a demand for relief; for instance, in this

8

Court's cases regarding Article 3 standing, it's

9

routinely said that plaintiff has to establish standing

10

separately for each claim, which means for each form of

And the word "claim" in the Tucker Act and its

enactment of section 1500, has been read by this Court

20

to mean a demand for relief.

Yes, I think the definition

different definition of "claim."

I think what we have

2

here is a narrower definition that was first established

3

in the 19th century through this Court's decisions

4

construing the Tucker Act and its predecessors.
Given that the word "claim" in the Tucker

5
6

Act carries that narrow meaning, it certainly makes

7

sense to construe the word "claim" in section 1500 as

8

having the same meaning.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

If you give it that narrow

10

meaning, however, the government says you are

11

contradicting what was the case with regard to the

12

cotton suits.

14

others were seeking relief against the individuals who

15

had taken the cotton or replanted the cotton.

JUSTICE SCALIA:
