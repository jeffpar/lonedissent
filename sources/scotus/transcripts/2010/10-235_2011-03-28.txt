ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES A. ROTHFELD

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

We will hear

MR. ROTHFELD:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

In this case we find ourselves in the happy

12

situation of having to try to convince the Court that

13

its prior decisions were correct.

14

the enactment of FELA, the Court declared that it was

15

obvious that the statute contained a proximate cause

16

requirement.

17

conclusion over and over again in almost two dozen

18

decisions over the next 40 years.

19

morning is that the Court when it made these statements

20

got it right.

21

Just 5 years after

The Court went on to repeat that

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Our submission this

How did it happen that in

22

FELA we have proximate cause light?

23

different proximate cause than we see in other -- in

24

other torts cases.

25

It's just a

How -- how did that come about?

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, we -- we -- our
3

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

submission is that that is not correct, that that is not

2

what FELA provides for at all.

3

initial decisions, the ones that I referred to, it

4

stated very clearly that the ordinary proximate cause

5

rule applies.

6

Court stated in cases like Brady was the traditional

7

proximate cause standard.

8
9
10
11

And in the Court's

The -- the proximate cause test that the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Can you read the cases as

indicating that more deference is given to juries in
FELA cases than in other cases?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, that -- that's -- is a

12

separate one from the one we have here.

13

talking here about the nature of the -- the elements of

14

the cause of action that have to be demonstrated by -­

15

by the plaintiff; and so there -- the question of how

16

much of that evidence there has to be to get to the jury

17

is a separate question that's not presented here.

18

I mean, we are

Our submission, since you posed the

19

question, is that there is no different standard; that

20

FELA was not intended to depart from the ordinary common

21

law procedural approaches in that respect, either.

22
23
24
25

But on the question that's presented -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

But juries usually find

against railroads anyway, right?
MR. ROTHFELD:

I -- I wouldn't want to
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

commit myself to answering that question affirmatively,

2

Your Honor.

3

The Court has said that -- that FELA was

4

enacted to address particular problems in the

5

administration of the common law prior to 1908.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It also said that there's

7

a relaxed standard of causation.

I think that's what

8

Justice Kennedy is referring to when he said "proximate

9

cause light."

But we have said in more than one case

10

that there is a relaxed standard of causation in FELA

11

cases.

12

Was that wrong?
MR. ROTHFELD:

I think there are two ways to

13

respond to that, Justice Ginsburg.

14

until the Rogers decision, which is -- which is one of

15

the ones which has created I think some confusion in

16

this area, the Court was quite clear and unambiguous

17

that proximate cause in FELA applied in the ordinary

18

sense.

19

The first is that up

As I say, in cases like the Brady case the

20

Court stated what proximate cause means; it stated in -­

21

in entirely traditional terms that -- that the plaintiff

22

had to demonstrate that the injury followed in a

23

natural, probable foreseeable way from the wrongful

24

conduct, and so that -- that was the standard.

25

The Rogers case, which was the source of
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

some of the confusion in this area, in our view, as -­

2

as we think Justice Souter correctly demonstrated in his

3

opinion in Sorrell, and as we explain at some length in

4

our brief, Rogers we think did not address causation at

5

all.

6

were a multiplicity of causes, and the question was what

7

-- what should -- should the rule be when there are a

8

number of -- of entities that contribute to the

9

accident.

The Rogers case was a situation in which there

It had nothing to do with remoteness or

10

directness of the cause, what we usually think about

11

when we talk about proximate cause.

12

In -- in the years since Rogers was decided,

13

when the Court -- got out of the business of deciding

14

FELA cases on the facts, it had not had occasion on -­

15

in any case to address specifically what proximate cause

16

meant in the FELA context.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Counsel -­

Well, we have used that

19

language.

20

question where -- where did this language that does

21

appear in our -- in our cases about the relaxed

22

standard, where -- where does that come from?

23

You -- you have not responded to -- to the

MR. ROTHFELD:

That -- that comes from, W

24

submit, from sort of a loose description of what was

25

going on in the Rogers case, which involved a
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

multiplicity of causes rather than directness and

2

remoteness of causes, and so the cases in which that

3

language appears, which are the Crane case and the

4

Gottshall case, did not involve causation at all.

5

question of causation was not presented to the Court in

6

those cases.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The

It has nothing to do with

8

the line of cases I think in the '40s in the FELA cases

9

where the message of this Court seemed to be quite

10

clear, FELA cases go to juries?

11

cases with reverse dissents that seem to -- to say just

12

that.

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

There are a number of

Well, that -- that goes to

14

the question that Justice Kennedy raised at the outset,

15

which is how much evidence, whatever the standard of

16

causation is, how much evidence must there be to go to

17

the jury?

18

not change the ordinary standard on -- on that question.

19

But that -- but that is not the question that's

20

presented in this case.

21

And our presentation here is that FELA did

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what -- can you

22

explain to me -- I mean, here the judge charged in the

23

words of the statute, and they are also the words used

24

in the model Federal instruction:

25

injury result in whole or in part from the railroad's
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Did plaintiff's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

negligence?

2

You would say:

Was plaintiff's injury

3

proximately caused.

4

Mr. Rothfeld, that term "proximate cause," it just loses

5

juries.

6

what do you say to the instruction that's now given,

7

based on the words of the statute, "Did plaintiff's

8

injury result in whole or part from the railroad's

9

negligence"?

10

And as you no doubt know,

So considering that these cases go to the jury,

What should the judge charge instead of

that?

11

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I think there are -­

12

there are two parts to your question, Justice Ginsburg.

13

One -- one is, what's wrong with the instruction that

14

was given here; and the other is can juries understand

15

proximate cause as a concept.

16

On -- on the first point, we have no

17

objection to the instruction containing the language of

18

the statute.

19

and intelligently applied by jurors, it has to say more

20

than that.

21

the cause of action and that has to be explained to a

22

jury.

23

for example, that a judge could simply charge the jury:

24

You are to determine whether there has been an

25

unreasonable restraint of trade; now go to the jury room

The problem is that to be comprehensible

Proximate cause we submit is an element of

It couldn't be the case in a Sherman Act case,

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and answer that question.

2

to go into that cause of action, including, as it

3

happens, proximate cause.

4

There is a lot more that has

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rothfeld, could you

5

explain to me how it would have made a difference in

6

this case, that instruction?

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

It -- it would have made a

8

difference I guess in two respects.

One is that the

9

plaintiff's theory has never at any point been that

10

there was proximate cause in this case.

11

contend that there was before the -- the district court

12

and he does not contend in his brief before this Court

13

that there was proximate cause made out.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

He did not

And so -­

Well, maybe explain the

15

difference.

16

I asked how would you tell the jury?

17

to say:

18

part from the railroad's negligence, but the judge must

19

say something more.

20

I mean, you were answering my question, and
You said it's okay

Did plaintiff's injury result in whole or in

So what is the something more?

MR. ROTHFELD:

The something more is what

21

this Court said in its Brady decision, in which it

22

described -- the decision in Brady, which is cited and

23

discussed in our opening brief in -- in some detail.

24

Brady described what proximate cause means in the FELA

25

context; and it means, the Court said, that there must
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

be a demonstration that the plaintiff's injury resulted

2

from the wrongful conduct in a way that was natural,

3

probable, and foreseeable.

4

traditional statement, is still today a traditional

5

statement of proximate cause.

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

7

Natural, probable, and

foreseeable?

8
9

That -- that was a

MR. ROTHFELD:

And foreseeable.

That -­

that language was taken in the Brady case directly from

10

the Court's decision, 1876 decision in the Kellogg

11

decision, which we also cite in our brief, which states

12

-­

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can you tell me -- there

14

is an article that suggests that juries don't actually

15

understand what "proximate cause" means; and I think,

16

and Justice Ginsburg can correct me, that what does that

17

mean to a jury -- natural, probable, and foreseeable?

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are the three phrases

20

different?

21

in to describe that difference in a comprehensible way?

22

And how much more detail do you have to get

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, that -- that was the

23

second part of Justice Ginsburg's question, and I got

24

distracted, and I'm happy to address it.

25

of the criticism of proximate cause as being confusion
10
Alderson Reporting Company

I think most

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to the jury has actually been directed at the word

2

"proximate," that commentators and some courts have said

3

that's a confusing word, it suggests immediacy, it

4

suggests closeness in time, it sounds like

5

"approximate," and so juries find it confusing.

6

But there is -- once it's spelled out, I

7

mean, the fact is juries have been applying proximate

8

cause, which has been a fundamental, settled, universal,

9

universally accepted part of common law of torts, in the

10

medicine context in particular, and it has been settled

11

for 150 years.

12
13
14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Apparently only FELA juries

cannot understand it; all other juries find it okay.
MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I -- it is our

15

submission that FELA juries would have no more

16

difficulty applying it than do juries under the Sherman

17

Act or RICO or the securities laws or, the other

18

statutes that this Court has said include a proximate

19

cause requirement, or that juries apply every day in

20

courts across the country in court cases.

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I just don't -- and

22

maybe this has already been asked, but I'm not sure from

23

a juror's perspective that it makes terribly much

24

difference the exact formulation of this instruction.

25

think a juror who sees an employee is suing the
11
Alderson Reporting Company

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

railroad, and it turns out that what the railroad did

2

had very little or nothing to do with what happened to

3

the employee, they don't need an instruction about

4

natural, foreseeable causes.

5

give the awards, or they're going to give the awards

6

even though the railroad didn't do anything that

7

affected the employee.

8
9

They're just not going to

It's a -- it's a nuance that I just don't
think has any practical significance.

10

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, we have to assume that

11

juries follow jury instructions.

12

premise of the system, and there is no reason to doubt

13

that in the ordinary case, in which the contents of

14

proximate cause are -- are explained to the jury in an

15

intelligent -- in a way that -- that people can

16

comprehend.

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's the fundamental

Your client is entitled to

18

have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right?

19

That's what you're arguing?

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If the -- if the jury -­
Juries disregard

22

instructions on probable cause, on proximate cause.

23

They probably do it in non-FELA cases, too.

24

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I -- I -­

25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

But you're entitled to have

12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

them disregard the correct instruction rather than an

2

incorrect instruction, right?

3

MR. ROTHFELD:

I will endorse that.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

My point is that I

5

don't see much practical difference between what you

6

argue is the correct instruction and what your friend

7

argues is the correct instruction.

8

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, certainly, in terms -­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, law

10

students, professors, and some judges have had trouble

11

defining the concept of proximate cause for centuries.

12

I don't know why we expect a juror to be able to

13

navigate through those nuances, either.

14

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, I -- the -- the

15

principle of proximate cause, the idea that there has to

16

be some limitation beyond but-for causation on

17

liability, has been universally recognized.

18

by -- by courts, by this Court, by commentators, by the

19

Restatement.

20

clearly endorsed it.

21

terminology, but they clearly endorsed the absolute

22

necessity of a proximate cause limitation on liability.

23

Recognized

The Third Restatement, just published,
They use -- they quibble about the

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you think that over the

24

last few decades, there's been an increasing emphasis on

25

foreseeability as a component of proximate cause?
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

There -- there probably has

2

been.

3

Restatement, which has a very useful summary of the

4

course of the law in this area.

5

that are now being used by courts are foreseeability and

6

directness, which are closely related, I think.

7

clearly, as this Court stated just this month in the

8

Stout case, it stated a test of proximate cause in terms

9

of whether -­

10

I mean, I'll defer again to the Third

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And the principal tests

I mean,

Could you give some

11

examples of what causes would be proximate and what

12

causes would not so qualify?

13

said but-for is no good.

14

cause but not a proximate cause?

15

MR. ROTHFELD:

Something that's -- you

So what would be a but-for

A but-for cause in this

16

context would be, there's a defective brake on -- on the

17

locomotive and it comes to a sudden stop.

18

conductor, standing in the locomotive when the train

19

stops, is thrown to the floor and injured, clearly that

20

is proximate cause.

21

is related to the risk that made the conduct actionable

22

in the first place.

23

If the

It -- it is -- it is an injury that

The reason that having defective brakes is

24

negligent and gives rise to a cause of action is because

25

it can cause an accident that will cause people to fall,
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

cause the train to hit something, will cause derailment.

2

That's why it is negligent, and if the kind of injury

3

that follows from the accident is related to that risk,

4

that clearly is proximate cause.

5

The kind which is not would be, train stops

6

because of the defective brake.

7

Conductor gets off the train to walk along and see

8

what's going on, trips and turns his leg, or is bitten

9

by a snake.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No one is injured.

Mr. Rothfeld, are there any

11

cases like that in the FELA world?

12

that this basic instruction that was given in this case

13

is the instruction that's given in most cases.

14

look across the range of cases, do you find jurors

15

awarding damages in the kind of situation that you're

16

talking about?

17

problem?

18

You know, I take it

If you

In other words, is this a real-world

MR. ROTHFELD:

They did in precisely the

19

case I just described, a case called Richards from the

20

Sixth Circuit, which is cited in the amicus brief

21

submitted by the Association of American Railroads.

22

train stops because of a defective brake, the conductor

23

gets off, walks along, turns his ankle and sues.

24
25

The

Clearly, the risk of someone getting off the
train and having a fortuitous injury is not the kind of
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

risk that gave rise to the negligence.

2

negligent to have a defective brake, but not because

3

there's a bystander who might be bitten by a snake or

4

turn -- turn his ankle.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. ROTHFELD:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, it's

Is there a case like that?
As I said, the Richards case.
Yes, but I mean somebody

8

might think that having to go off and patrol a thing in

9

a rough area is something that happens with a sudden

10
11

stop:

You run a risk of turning your leg.
I agree with you about the snake.

12

any case about the snake?

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

14
15

Is there

I -- I can't cite you a snake

case directly, but -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So the furthest -­

16

the furthest -- the furthest that you go is the case of

17

sudden stop in the wilderness, gets off, rough area, and

18

twists his ankle.

19

MR. ROTHFELD:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21
22

proximate cause or not?
MR. ROTHFELD:

Or I'll -- I'll cite you -­
I don't know.

Is that

Maybe it isn't.
I'll give you two answers to

23

that, Your Honor.

First of all, there are other cases.

24

Another case, for example, cited in the amicus brief

25

that I referred to is the Schlumpert case from Georgia,
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in which there's a defective coupling device lying on

2

the ground.

3

because it was defective and fallen on someone's foot,

4

clearly that's proximate cause.

5

The employee comes along, picks it up, throws off -­

6

throws off his -- throws out his back, and sues.

7

is not the kind of -- of injury that one would foresee

8

comes from having defective couplers.

9

If it had -- if it had fallen off the train

But it's on the ground.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That

And do you want -­

10

what instruction would you give that would tell the jury

11

to allow damages in one of those -- the first of the

12

coupling cases, but not in the second?

13

MR. ROTHFELD:

The instruction we ask for is

14

the one this Court gave -- said should be given in the

15

Brady case:

16

not -­

17

Natural, foreseeable, and probable.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It is

Are jurors going to

18

sit there and say, one of those is natural, foreseeable,

19

and probable, but the other isn't?

20
21

MR. ROTHFELD:
it is -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

"natural" means.

situation?

25

I would -- I would say that

I don't know what

You know, so it's not a supernatural

Alderson Reporting Company

1

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well -- well, I'm just

2

quoting the Court's language to you, Your Honor.

3

but certainly, foreseeable and probable, one would say

4

that -­

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -­

It's not foreseeable

6

that if you drop a coupling where it's not supposed to

7

be, somebody will come along and try to pick it up and

8

move it?

9

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, but it's not

10

foreseeable in the sense that it is unrelated to the

11

risk that gave rise to -- to the cause of action in the

12

first place.

13

anything is foreseeable.

14

I mean, it's foreseeable in the sense that

If I give the classic example:

I drive -- I

15

drive you to New York, from Washington to New York, and

16

I drive too fast, exceeding the speed limit.

17

negligent.

18

drive too fast, of hitting somebody, of hitting another

19

car, of driving off the road.

20

you're injured as I drive you to New York, you can sue

21

me.

22

That's

It's negligent because I run the risk, if I

And so if I do that and

But that doesn't happen.

I drive -- I get

23

to New York safely, you get out of the car, and as soon

as you get out, you are struck by lightning.

"reasonable and foreseeable," you would be satisfied?

MR. ROTHFELD:

Are you saying now that

Well, I think that it should

17

include the term "proximate" simply because that has

18

traditionally been the requirement.

That's what this

19

Court has said in cases like Brady.

It's what the Court

20

has said in cases applying other proximate cause -­

other elements of proximate causation in other

If

use those words instead?

MR. ROTHFELD:

I think not only do we have to assume that it makes a

find that -- that in any respect, the injuries

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you explain how it

10

might have made a difference in this particular case

11

based on the facts of the case?

12

Mr. McBride's theory was that as a result of having to

13

use the independent brake extensively over a long period

14

of time with this wide-bodied cab, his hand got tired

15

and it fell, and it hit the independent brake.

As I understand it,

16

Is that -- that's the theory?

17

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well -- that -- that -­

18

that's his explanation of the accident.

19

negligence, as I understand it, as it was presented to

20

the jury by his expert was that the configuration of the

21

train that he was driving was unsafe because it -- it

22

could lead to derailments, it could lead to breaking of

23

the couplers.

24
25

The theory of

As explained by his expert, the -- the
theory was not that there was something unsafe about the
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arrangement of the braking system, and so, I think that

2

the -- the way in which a proximate cause instruction

3

properly given here could have made a difference is that

4

the jury could have found, well, yes, it was negligent

5

to have these five locomotives arranged in the way that

6

they were, but that had nothing to do, except in a but­

7

for sense, with the fact that the -- the -- that

8

Mr. McBride's hand was injured; that the jury could have

9

made that determination and so it could have made a

10

difference.

11

Now, I mean, the fact is there was no

12

proximate cause argument made below because the

13

instruction that was given by the district court

14

excluded it.

15

theory of the case advanced by Mr. McBride below simply

16

didn't take account of proximate cause.

17

And so, as I said before, the -- the

Now, if the -- if we prevail here and the

18

case goes back, he will be free to argue under a proper

19

instruction that there was proximate cause, that somehow

20

the configuration of the train affected his -- his

21

handling of the brake.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You're really suggesting

23

that the defense attorney here wouldn't have argued the

MR. ROTHFELD:

What we did didn't

if we assume that the configuration of the locomotives

was negligent, then but for the negligence of -- of the

railroad, this would not have occurred.

Did you argue, in effect, proximate cause?
MR. ROTHFELD:

configuration of the railroad was perfectly proper, and

25

that -- the -- the -- there was a contributory

6

to first principles, on the assumption that proximate

the jury on proximate cause and not, because the court

-- it has been a part of tort law, you know, for time

10

immemorial on the assumption that it does make a

11

difference and it has been an important part of tort law

12

because it has been universally recognized by courts, by

13

academics, by the Respondent that there has to be some

14

limitation on liability beyond but-for causation.

15

there is not, there is the danger of sort of infinite

16

liability, of limitless liability, and particularly of

fortuitous liability, because there is no way that the

defendant in a situation like this can anticipate that

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22
23
24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This case is a case that presents a
non-existent problem and a solution that is in search of
27
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a non-existent problem, because there are no real

2

reported cases where there have been problems arising

3

under the Rogers instructions that have become the model

4

instructions under the Federal Rules for over 50 years.

5

And if could I just begin, Justice Kennedy,

6

with your question which opened this up, proximate cause

7

serves two principal functions.

8

scope of the persons to whom the tortfeasor owes a duty;

9

and the second is to limit the kinds of injuries that

10
11

One is to limit the

that person would be liable for.
The innovation in FELA that is so important

12

to understand about why the relaxed causation standard

13

became the accepted standard under FELA was that FELA,

14

by its plain terms, did away with the first concept of

15

proximate cause because it limited the duty to the

16

employee by the employer.

17

that relationship that can bring an action under FELA.

18

There is no one outside of

And the second thing that it did was it put

19

into what is now section 51 that if the negligence

20

results in, quote, "in whole or in part" from the

21

negligence of the railroad, that is enough for injury.

22

At common law the proximate cause standard required that

23

the railroad's negligence be the sole cause.

24

innovation that created the relaxation in the causation

25

standard was the inclusion of these words in part, and

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Of course, the other side

3

says that what that meant, and -- and -- and the

language of our cases seems to support that, "in whole

5

or in part" simply eliminated the common law doctrine of

6

contributory negligence, whereby if the plaintiff also

7

had been negligent, the plaintiff could not recover,

8

and -- and FELA uses a -- a -- a comparative negligence

9

standard.

10

MR. FREDERICK:

And this Court has rejected

11

that kind of approach almost from the beginning of the

statute.

cause.

2

that arguably were only about single causes.

decided another case under FELA, the Webb case.

5

of those cases, there were no multiple causes, there was

additive to the words that Mr. Rothfeld now proposes for

most juries would commonly understand, "probable" means

with the statutory words "in part," and directly

contrary to the way courts had universally understood

this language since Rogers.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know if they said

were not appropriate for the switching exercise that the

train men were doing on that day, and in fact the

15

supervising engineer said this was the only time that he

16

was aware in his long experience where these wide-body

17

locomotives were used for this specific purpose which

18

required a lot of braking activity.

19

The second theory of negligence was that Mr.

20

McBride was put to this purpose without proper training.

21

He has complained on the day; he was uncomfortable and

22

he didn't know whether he could operate that locomotive;

His -- let's start with his

poor training.

8

was more skilled in the art of dealing with a wide-boded

9

locomotive would be able to manipulate the independent

10

brake with the automatic brake in a way that would not

11

cause the repetitive stress that Mr. McBride suffered.

12

And there was further testimony that using a wide-body

13

locomotive, which is more difficult to manipulate for

14

the switching operations, and here we're talking about

15

moving in and off main tracks to couple trains, train

16

cars so that they can be used for a longer

17

destination -- that that kind of equipment was not

18

suited for the purpose.

19

There was testimony that a person who

Mr. McBride's testimony was when he had used

20

the wide-body locomotive, he had done so on long trips

21

over long distances that didn't require the same kind of

22

ready, manipulative braking of the independent brake.

11

"defendant caused or contributed to plaintiff's injury

that Justice Scalia, and I think the Rogers Court

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

perhaps, we can get to why, under what formulation, if

22

it didn't know harm was going to happen or could happen.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

Well -­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Reasonably foreseeable.
I think that the

39
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

concept of foreseeability is one that has alternated in

2

and out of this Court's cases, but let's take the case

3

of Gallick in 1963, where a fetid pool with vermin and

4

rats were allowed to live by the railroad's negligence,

5

and it was believed that an insect was growing -- insect

6

bodies were growing in that fetid pool, and as a result

7

of that insect bite, the injured worker's legs had to be

8

amputated by the effect of this insect bite.

9

Now, many people would argue -- in fact, the

10

lower court had concluded -- that it was not reasonably

11

foreseeable that the railroad's negligence in allowing

12

that stagnant pool to exist would nonetheless lead to

13

the injury sustained by the worker.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It might not be

15

reasonably foreseeable that an amputation would occur,

16

but it was reasonably foreseeable that some injury to

17

people would happen as a result of these infected insect

18

bites, no?

19

That's what the court ultimately said.
MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

But what

20

the court had also done was to rely on earlier cases in

21

which it's saying these concepts really are relaxed

22

because the purpose of FELA is to provide a substitute,

23

if you will, for workers' compensation, where if you can

24

establish negligence on the part of the railroad and it

25

causes, in part, the injury, the railroad will be liable
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2

for that.
And that's why this -- these concepts of

3

proximate cause really are getting at a different

4

problem, which is that when these statutes are enacted,

5

you're trying to guard the defendant's liability against

6

the entire world.

7

impose some kind of restriction for foreseeability or

8

for directness, because otherwise anybody could be

9

liable to anybody else.

And that's why it makes sense to

Here, that problem is removed,

10

because the railroad is the only -- can only be sued,

11

under FELA, by the employee, and only if its negligence

12

plays a role in producing that injury.

13

If I could go back to the words that

14

Mr. Rothfeld's trial counsel had proposed, the "probable

15

sequence" word is now not even used anymore in Illinois.

16

So it would be very odd to think that you would reverse

17

an instruction here, where the proffered instruction by

18

the railroad doesn't even State what -- the proximate

19

cause instruction in the model language.

20

Now the model language under Illinois calls

21

for the natural and ordinary course of events.

That's

22

how proximate cause is now done under the Illinois

23

proposed instructions.

24

language, Mr. Chief Justice, takes us any different from

25

the common instruction that all juries are given, to use

5

apply their common sense without introducing the word

confuse juries because most of them, you know, many

would be to go back and try again based on the words

that are there, because the whole idea behind these

13

words was to try to end the debate between this Court

14

and many State courts that simply didn't grasp that FELA

15

was intended to provide a remedial statute with a

causation element that was a weaker causation element

17

than in normal negligence cases.

verdicts by State supreme courts that were overturning

jury verdicts.

22

remove the appellate review process from a lot of these

that they cite from one of their amici.

Surely the burden is on the

debate these hypotheticals, I would suppose, but they

2

don't have any relation to the real world.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose the jury asks, Is it

4

sufficient, is it necessary for the injury to be

5

foreseeable?

6

What does the trial judge say then?
MR. FREDERICK:

I think the trial judge

7

says, No, it is not necessary for it to be foreseeable

8

in a direct -- if the negligence plays a part, however

9

small, in producing the injury.

10

And that's why in cases like the Ferguson

11

case, which was decided the same day as Rogers -- I

12

mean, that's a very out-there set of facts, where the

13

ship steward -- and remember, what you decide here also

14

applies in the Jones Act for sea workers as well.

15

in that case, the Court said it was a jury question,

16

whether the failure to provide an appropriate to

17

implement to scoop hardened ice cream from the freezer

18

on the ship was foreseeable, whether or not the ship's

19

steward, in serving the ice cream, would reach for a

20

butcher knife to try to chip away and lead to the

21

severing of two of his fingers.

22

But

I mean, we're talking about a dangerous

23

situation, Justice Alito.

At the time that FELA was

24

enacted, in a year prior to that, some 12,000 people

25

died and there were hundreds of thousands of injuries,
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and the idea behind the statute was to provide a broad

2

remedy so that rail workers could be compensated, not

3

get extra damages like punitive damages, but just

4

compensated for their injuries.

5

that railmen know they're going to have to go before

6

juries exercising their common sense, and juries have,

7

in many, many cases, ruled in favor of the railroads.

8

And that system ought to be allowed to continue.

9

And so the result is

If I could go back to one last point, and

10

that is the idea of statutory stare decisis.

11

that because Rogers construed the "in whole or in part"

12

language, it's entitled to statutory stare decisis where

13

jury instructions have used that language.

14

We believe

And at some level, this case is not too far

15

from the Hylton case, which was decided in the early

16

'90s, except the difference is in Hylton, the Court had

17

dealt with a case from the early 1960s called Parden.

18

And that case had had many of the underpinnings of -- of

19

the question there that had been discredited or undercut

20

by subsequent decisions.

Here, there are no cases since Rogers that

suggest doubt on the general validity of the Rogers

rule.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

We have three justices of

2

this Court that say Rogers is irrelevant because it had

3

to do only with multiple causes.

4

MR. FREDERICK:

And my answer to that,

5

Justice Ginsburg, is that after Rogers, the Court

6

applied the Rogers language to single cause cases.

7

have Webb, we have Ferguson, we have Kernan, we have

8

Gallick, we have the statement in Crane that comparing

9

the actions of the nonemployee, the -- the explanation

We

10

for why the nonemployee has to go to common law is

11

because there are these special features of FELA, one of

12

which is no common law proximate cause and the

13

elimination of contributory negligence and assumption of

14

the risk.

15

And then subsequently when the Court in

16

Ayers and then in Gottshall says very clearly these are

17

ways that FELA has departed from the common law and from

18

the other statutes, in Gottshall the Court was very

19

clear that it is relaxed causation and that this is one

20

of the departures from normal common law standards.

21

would seem odd to hold now that all of a sudden we're

22

going to talk about common law standards for causation

or not the kind of -- the risk of -- that there would be

an injury follows from the -- the nature of the

misconduct that gives rise to liability in the first

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if it's probable it's

foreseeable, but it can be foreseeable even though it's

19

not probable.

20

MR. ROTHFELD:

Well, it -- but I think what

21

probable means in this context it has to be foreseeable,

22

not simply in the theoretical, I can foresee if I drive

23

too fast in New York, maybe there will be a lightning

strike -- I mean, I can imagine that.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If that's true, that -­

2

everything that's natural and probable is foreseeable,

3

but not everything that's foreseeable is natural and

4

probable, you were requesting a jury instruction that

5

didn't go as far to help you as was possible, but you

6

were still requesting a jury instruction that was on the

7

road.

8
9

MR. ROTHFELD:

That's -- to me the only

question now here before this Court is whether we are

10

entitled to a jury instruction that states properly the

11

nature of the proximate cause test, and if the case goes

12

back under that standard, then the arguments that have

13

been suggested by Mr. Frederick can be presented to the

14

jury.

15

right; and to the extent that there was anything wrong

16

with the instruction, we would provide it.

But -- but as you say, Justice Scalia, that's

17

JUSTICE SCALIA:

18

MR. ROTHFELD:

This case go to the jury?
I think it would be open to

19

argue that it's so clear that -- that there was no

20

proximate cause that it shouldn't; but that's a question

21

to be posed on remand.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry, Mr. Rothfeld, I

23

didn't understand what you just said, because the

24

requested jury instruction that -- that you gave was any

25

cause which in natural or probable sequence produced the

injury.

Is that right?

2
3

MR. ROTHFELD:

That was the requested

instruction.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So that's essentially saying

5

that the jury has to say it's 51 percent likely to

6

produce the injury, isn't that right?

7

MR. ROTHFELD:

8

terms.

I -- it was not put in those

I -- I would not think -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it says natural or

10

probable, and probable means more likely than not, which

11

is 51 percent.

MR. ROTHFELD:

I -- again, it was not -­

13

outcome, but it has to find that there is some

substantial probability that it will be the outcome,
