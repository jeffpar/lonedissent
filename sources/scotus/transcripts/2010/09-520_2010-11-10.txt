Transportation v. The Alabama Department of Revenue.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PHILLIPS:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The pivotal, and in my judgment, incorrect

11
12

holding of the Eleventh Circuit in the Norfolk Southern

13

case is reproduced in the appendix to this case, because

14

Norfolk Southern is the controlling precedent for our -­

15

for our particular dispute.

16

appendix to the petition, in there, the court of appeals

17

said that there is nothing in the 4-R Act's plain

18

language that indicates an intent to reach exemptions

19

content from generally applicable sales and use taxes.

And at page 29A of the

To our way of thinking, all this case is

20
21

about:

22

employ exemptions without exposing the effects of those

23

exemptions to a challenge under (b)(4) of the statute.

24
25

Whether or not the State has free reign to

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But in light of our AFC

case, it seems to me that what you are arguing is that
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the statute -- the effect of your argument is that the

2

statute gives more protection in the case of

3

non-property taxes than property taxes, and that's an -­

4

an odd reading of the statute, which is directed

5

primarily to the -- to the property tax.

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I think, Justice Kennedy,

7

what we are doing is recognizing that Congress was very

8

specific and very explicit about how to treat property

9

taxes and set up an entire quite carefully articulated

10

scheme in dealing with them in (b)(1) and (b)(3), and

11

then said, in general, when you are dealing with areas

12

that are not approved by (b)(1) and (b)(3), then you

13

have to examine whether or not the overall scheme, in

14

fact, discriminates against rail carriers.

15

So, while it is true that there could be

16

circumstances in which you may end up with somewhat more

17

protection as a consequence of (b)(4), I think that's a

18

function of Congress not having limited the (b)(4)

19

exemption to property, and just saying it's -- it's a

20

discrimination against the rail carrier generally that

21

the statute is aimed to prevent or to protect against.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But what's the -- what's the

23

possible rationale for that distinction?

24

distinction make any sense?

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Why would that

Well, I think because
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress didn't have the full run mine of possibilities

2

in front of it at that point in time.

3

probably had some sense of what other taxes were out

4

there that might pose discrimination, but I do think

5

that Congress is very much concerned that the States,

6

once they saw the roadmap laid out for them in (b)(1)

7

through (b)(3), might seek other ways to recoup what

8

they were going to lose in revenues when the 3-year

9

period lapsed, and to be in a position to protect the

I mean, it

10

railroads in the (b)(4) -- through (b)(4) in a situation

11

when there would be future actions taken by the States.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

12
13

-- in the legislative

record?
MR. PHILLIPS:

14

Not -- there's very little in

15

the legislative record, Your Honor, because the -- the

16

specific formulation of -- of this (b)(4) catch-all

17

provision comes in very, very late in the 15-year

18

process.

19

court that has looked at it has drawn the inference,

20

which seems to me the only fair inference to draw, when

21

Congress said:

22

taxes.

23

Every other lower court that -- every lower

Look, this is not just for in lieu

I mean, there was -- there was some debate

24

about that going on between the House and the Senate,

25

and the conference committee makes it clear.
5
Alderson Reporting Company

This is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

not just something that's adopted by the States in lieu

2

of a broader property tax.

3

have, I think, the language that you would normally give

4

to a term as broad and sweeping as any other tax that

5

discriminates against rail carriers.

6

It is intended, then, to

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Phillips, this is what

7

troubles me about -- about your position:

You make a

8

viscerally appealing case on the facts of this case,

9

where you say that your clients, the railroads, are

10

being taxed more than competing carriers, truckers

11

and -- and water carriers.

12

But if all -- if all it says is

13

"discriminates," and you think that that has to be

14

applied without qualification, then even if -- if a

15

state makes an exemption for, you know, widows over 85

16

and doesn't make the same exemption for railroads, the

17

railroads win, right?

18
19
20

MR. PHILLIPS:

That -- that -- no, I don't

believe that's the necessary -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why?

21

term "discrimination"?

22

of other competing carriers?

23

How do you limit the

Just a discrimination in favor

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think it -- it is

24

discrimination that Congress would have intended to

25

prohibit under these circumstances.
6
Alderson Reporting Company

So I think in the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

situation where you are talking about a single exemption

2

for some group that does not compete or otherwise do any

3

business with the railroads, we would not have a basis

4

for saying they were similarly situated -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

5
6

that?

7

property tax exemption.

Congress didn't limit it to that in -- in the

MR. PHILLIPS:

8
9

Why -- why do you assume

Well, it -- it did to some

extent, because there was a whole question about how -­

10

you know, you had a whole comparative class that

11

Congress defines in the property context.

12

context between the industrial and commercial property

13

and the railroads' property.

14

comparison class, but I don't think it's fair -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

15

So you make a

So Congress defined the

But not -- not just the

16

industrial and -- and commercial competitors with the

17

railroads.

18

the most favored treatment of -- of all the industrial

19

and -- and commercial entities, I -- I think.

20

The railroads were to be given, you know,

MR. PHILLIPS:

To be sure, Justice Scalia,

21

but it was still as compared to the entirety of the

22

industrial and commercial property base, and it was -­

23

and the analysis has traditionally been the averages of

24

the commercial industrial property.

25

So you -- and part of the problem here -­
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

it's not a problem, but, you know, one of the reasons

2

why you can't make direct comparisons is that because of

3

ACF Industries, you don't evaluate exemptions under

4

(b)(1) to (b)(3) -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

5

But in this case -­

6

correct me if I'm wrong -- off-road users, agricultural

7

users, and construction and timber companies -­

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

10

Right.
-- have the same -- have

the same tax structure as the railroads.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So there is an objective

13

reference, neutral, and it seems to me that that's just

14

quite rational to put the railroads there and not in the

15

category of road -- road users.
Now, if -- unless you are arguing the

16
17

discrimination has to have -- has to have a purposive

18

component.

19

not sure you prevail on that, either.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

That might give you a different case.

I'm

Well, but -- remember,

21

Justice Kennedy, we don't even get to this issue if what

22

you say is we are going to take all exemptions off the

23

table.

24

point, which is that there is a reason why this is a

25

viscerally satisfying case, because we are talking here

And I guess I would go back to Justice Scalia's

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

about a discrimination.
You know, when Congress says, we want to -­

2
3

we want to eliminate any tax that discriminates against,

4

the one thing it seems to me, clearly, Congress did not

5

intend to exclude from that was a tax that discriminates

6

against the -- the immediate direct competitors of the

7

railroads in a way that would undoubtedly undermine the

8

stability of the -- the financial stability and success

9

of the railroad.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

I thought the concern was

11

that the interstate actors should not be disadvantaged

12

vis-à-vis the home people, the local businesses, and

13

that was what was achieved.
But you're -- you are not complaining about

14
15

discrimination against a railroad in comparison to local

16

businesses.

17

are not getting most-favored-nations treatment vis-à-vis

18

other interstate carriers.

19

You -- you are complaining about that you

MR. PHILLIPS:

That's -- that's correct,

20

Justice Ginsberg, but I think the premise of your -- of

21

your question is the place where we would probably

22

differ, which is:

23

protect interstate carriers against discrimination in

24

favor of local operations.

25

through (b)(3) and otherwise pervades the legislative

To be sure, Congress intended to

That's clear in (b)(1)

9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

history.
But there is also a significant amount of

2
3

discussion in that same legislative history to encourage

4

intermodal competition; that is, competition between the

5

railroads and others, both intrastate and interstate.

6

And so it seems to me that the statute that's -- that

7

prohibits all discrimination against rail carriers,

8

identified as carriers -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

Suppose a -- suppose a tax

10

were structured so that the same tax applied to

11

railroads and -- and -- and motor transport, but because

12

of the way the tax was assessed, the railroads paid far

13

more per mile than -- than the -- than the road

14

transport.

15

Oh, we want to be like the farmers; we are off-road?
I mean, I can see you making that

16
17

argument -­
MR. PHILLIPS:

18
19

Could the railroad then come in and say:

argument -­
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

20
21

number two, welcome back.

22

argument.

23

I can see us making that

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- in case -- in case

That's going to be your

Well, I always like to come

24

back, but I don't -- I think the answer to that is -­

25

again, I think the -- the Court ought to interpret the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

term "discrimination" against the clear objectives that

2

Congress intended to fulfill when it protected the

3

railroads this way.

4

And the two protections that are embedded in

5

there is one that Justice Ginsberg identified, which was

6

to protect them against local interests in a way where

7

they had no political influence, and the other one is to

8

protect them against their direct competitors in the

9

intermodal competition realm.

And if it's -- if it's a

10

discrimination that doesn't achieve either of those,

11

then it seems to me you either say they are -- are not

12

similarly situated or you would held -- you would hold

13

that the State has a legitimate reason for doing what

14

it's doing, and that that's just not a discrimination

15

within the meaning of the statute.

16

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So -- so 85-year-old widows

17

would be covered?

18

you know, there are only resident 85-year-old widows who

19

are covered, right?

20

That would be discrimination because,

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, they would have -- they

21

would be, to be sure, local interests.

22

problem with this is, and it goes to the core argument

23

that the State makes, which is:

24

define "local business" for these purposes.

25

But I think the

How are you supposed to

And I don't think the -- the answer to that
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

is:

2

purport to define the comparison class for purposes of

3

(b)(4).

4

other tax" -­

5

I have no way to know that, because Congress didn't

It seems to me that when Congress said "any

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I agree with that, and that

6

makes me suspect that Congress didn't -- didn't want to

7

forbid exemptions in (b)(4).

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

But it seems to me quite -- I

mean, the flip side of that argument would be to say, if

10

they imposed the tax of 4 percent on the railroads and

11

2 percent on 85-year-old widows, that would be

12

challengeable under (b)(4), because it's not an

13

exemption, it's a differential, and that the exemption

14

down to zero is -- is attackable under (b)(4).

15

It seems to me the right answer to this is,

16

there is no reason to include your widow as a relative

17

comparison class for purposes of (b)(4) and get out of

18

that problem as opposed to setting this up.

19

To me, the fallacy of this analysis is to

20

try to use exemptions and say that there is something

21

special about exemptions beyond the (b)(1), (b)(3)

22

context where Congress clearly acted, recognizing that

23

it had to protect the States' ability to have exemptions

24

for property taxes.

25

But then Congress goes to non-property taxes
12
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and to other taxes not covered by (b)(1) and (b)(3).

2

Then, it seems to me, you have to -- you just should

3

change the analysis.

4

situated are being treated differently and if there is

5

any kind of State justification for that, and if not, go

6

through the analysis in the way -- and protect the

7

railroads precisely the way that Congress meant for them

8

to be protected.

9

Look at whether or not similarly

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Phillips, are you

10

saying that the -- the railroads have to be taxed in the

11

very same way as, say, the -- the trucks?

12

answer to your argument is:

13

a non-tax situation for the other interstate carriers;

14

they are just subject to a different tax.

15

carriers have to pay motor fuel tax.

16

Because one

Well, they haven't created

The motor

So are you saying to the State about that,

17

you have to have the same sales tax, use tax, for

18

everyone; you can't have a motor fuel tax for one and

19

sales tax for the other?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think, ultimately, my

21

conclusion would be that you can't have one -- you can't

22

have this kind of a tax on us and not tax the motor

23

carriers the same way.

24

recognize two considerations, at least as this case

25

comes to this Court.

But I do think it's important to

13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

One is that the State and the trial court

2

conceded that the appropriate comparison class was the

3

motor and water carriers.

4

the -- who is properly in the comparison class has never

5

been adjudicated.

So the question of who is

And second, it seems to me that the question

6
7

of what constitutes discrimination is not the issue in

8

this case.

9

there is something special about exemptions that makes

10
11

The only question in this case is whether

them off-limits to the (b)(4) inquiry.
So I think, candidly, Justice Ginsburg,

12

while I'm quite certain that Alabama and I would

13

disagree fundamentally about how to approach this, it

14

doesn't seem to me that that's a question that this

15

Court should tarry long over, and instead ought to

16

simply evaluate the very narrow question that was both

17

presented by the holding below and presented in the

18

petition as it came through the Solicitor General's

19

invitation stage, which again, as I say, very narrowly

20

focuses exclusively on exemptions, and of course allow

21

us to have them.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, why does the course

23

for the court -- taking account of what you said, that

24

the provision about other taxes came out very late in

25

the day -- they had spent a lot of time talking about
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the property tax.

And the property tax, we know, they

2

wanted to preserve the exemptions.
So why not take this latecomer of thought or

3
4

discussion and say:

5

to treat that with regard to exemptions the same way

6

that they treated property tax, which was the big-ticket

7

item.

8
9

Well, we'll assume that they want

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think part of the

reason, it may well be because the property tax was a

10

big-ticket item, so you were trying to protect certain

11

State interests, and Congress did it very clearly.

12

think it is quite a remarkable stretch of -- of

13

construction of the statute for the Court to say, we're

14

going to take this very carefully reticulated scheme,

15

which creates the inference that Congress meant to

16

protect these kinds of exemptions for the States, and

17

say we are going to now incorporate that wholesale, when

18

Congress didn't use language that in any way compares.

19

It didn't include -- it didn't limit it to

I

20

railroad property.

21

particular way, and instead, it basically said, what we

22

need here is something that will protect the railroads

23

when the States become more innovative and come forward

24

with additional problems.

25

It didn't define a class in any

And we would leave it to the courts,
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

unfortunately -- I recognize that is not the most

2

satisfying solution sometimes, but we will leave it to

3

the courts to decide what forms of discrimination we

4

would have intended to preclude, because we are here to

5

protect the railroads.
If there are no further questions, I would

6
7

like to reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MELISSA A. SHERRY,

12

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

13
14
15
16

MS. SHERRY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The only question that the Court needs to

17

resolve today is whether a non-property tax that's

18

imposed on a rail carrier but from which its competitors

19

are exempt can ever be another tax that discriminates

20

against a rail carrier under subsection (b)(4).

21

answer is yes.

22

The

A lot of the Court's questions focus on some

23

of the difficulties that are inherent in a

24

discrimination inquiry, but as Mr. Phillips pointed out,

25

those difficulties are just as inherent in a
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

discrimination inquiry under (b)(4), whether we are

2

talking about exemptions or whether we are talking about

3

differential tax rates or whether we are talking about

4

any other type of discrimination claim that can be

5

brought under (b)(4).

6

(b)(4):

7

discriminates against a rail carrier, and inherent is

8

that is the notion that courts are going to have to

9

decide what it means to discriminate.

That is the very nature of

It broadly prohibits another tax that

JUSTICE ALITO:

10

Do you think we have to

11

decide whether the appropriate comparison class is the

12

rail carriers' competitors or some broader class?
MS. SHERRY:

13

I don't think the Court has to

14

decide it.

As Mr. Phillips pointed out, that was an

15

issue that was conceded below by the State, at least at

16

this stage of the proceedings.

17

that in note 7 of their brief, so it wasn't something

18

that was addressed by the Eleventh Circuit below.

And they acknowledged

I think, as the Court wants to address it,

19
20

it should reject the notion that the only comparison

21

class in a (b)(4) case, no matter what the (b)(4) case

22

looks like, is all other commercial and industrial

23

taxpayers.

24

primarily because that's not what the tax says.

25

And I think the Court should reject that

If you look at the language of (b)(4), it
17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

talks about another tax that discriminates against a

2

rail carrier.

3

tax that discriminates against a rail carrier, as

4

compared to other commercial and industrial taxpayers,

5

and it didn't do that.

Congress easily could have said another

And Justice Ginsburg, to your question

6
7

involving whether we should be focusing on interstate

8

versus local businesses and whether that was Congress's

9

focus, of course that was -- that was certainly one of

10

their concerns, but the reason that doesn't work is if

11

you look to even subsections (b)(1) through (3), the

12

comparison that is very clearly spelled out there is not

13

between local businesses and interstate businesses; it's

14

between rail transportation property and other

15

commercial and industrial property.
Now, that other commercial and industrial

16
17

property can be owned by an interstate business like

18

Wal-Mart just as easily as it can be owned by a local

19

coffee shop, and so I think to suggest that the only

20

thing Congress wanted to prohibit was this local

21

interstate type of discrimination is not borne out by

22

the text.

23

the language speaks for itself.

24

another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.

25

Another question that a number of you have

If you look at subsection (b)(4), we think
It speaks broadly of

18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

asked is why Congress would want to treat property

2

taxes' exemptions differently than non-property tax

3

exemptions, and I think the answer has to come from the

4

text.

5

In ACF, this court concluded that Congress

6

did not want to prohibit property tax exemptions based

7

on the text of the statute and its structure.

8

it comes to non-property taxes, the text of the act and

9

the structure of the act simply tell a different story,

And when

10

and that has to be the best indicator of what Congress

11

intended.

12

Again, subsection (b)(4) speaks broadly of

13

another tax that discriminates against a rail carrier.

14

This court has long recognized that taxes can

15

discriminate in a number of different ways, including by

16

granting some taxpayers an exemption and not granting

17

that exemption to other taxpayers.

18

meaning of "discriminates," and the broad and

19

unqualified language in (b)(4) is easily susceptible to

20

that meaning.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's the ordinary

Ms. Sherry, there seems to

So what's the

MS. SHERRY:

The government's position,

2

first with respect to subsection (c), is that it is a

3

broad grant of jurisdiction to the district courts to

4

adjudicate all violations of subsection (b), and that

5

seems clear from the first sentence in that provision.

6

I'd also note that the arguments that were

7

made with respect to subsection (c) in this case were

8

brought up by the government in ACF; and in ACF the

9

government explained why the best reading of subsection

10

(c) is a broad grant of jurisdiction over all violations

11

of subsection (b).

12

intended.

13

That's clearly what Congress

While Congress intended to provide a

14

substantive right for rail carriers to come into court

15

and claim discrimination on one of the four -- under one

16

of the four subsections, it also intended to provide a

17

Federal forum.

18

because at the time, rail carriers were having a very

19

hard time bringing claims in the State court.

20

Injunction Act was out there then, as it is now, and it

21

does provide an -- exception, rather -- for when State

22

court remedies are not plain, speedy, and efficient.

23

And the reason that it did that was

whether there is discrimination, and the Court finds

2

discrimination between the way the railroad is taxed and

3

the way motor carriers are taxed, what -- what then?

4

What is the remedy?
MS. SHERRY:

5

I think in that type of case

6

the remedy would be for the rail carrier to be exempt

7

from the tax, and that's because what subsection (c)

8

provides -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Without -- without

10

putting on -- I mean, the motor carriers do have the

11

tax.
MS. SHERRY:

12

Oh, I apologize.

I should back

13

up.

I am assuming that when you said that the Court

14

found that there was discrimination, the Court had

15

already engaged in inquiry as to whether or not this

16

other tax compensates for or provides a justification

17

for any differential treatment.

18

If the -- the Court were to find

19

discrimination but find that maybe, you know, 50 percent

20

of the tax was compensated by this other tax, it could

21

remedy that situation by only enjoining, and it should

22

remedy the situation by only enjoining, the

23

discriminatory portion of the tax.

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Well -- well, but in

any case when you have discrimination, you can remedy it
21
Alderson Reporting Company

by reducing the tax, for example, in this case on the

2

railroad or by increasing the tax on the people who are

3

otherwise exempt.

MS. SHERRY:

And I don't -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

A decision that I

6

suppose would be left at some point or another up to the

7

State.

9

MS. SHERRY:

It would certainly be left up

to the State and the State could choose to remedy it

10

in -- in any number of different ways, including the one

11

that Your Honor suggests, but the remedy that is

12

actually provided for in subsection (c) for the Federal

13

court to issue is to enjoin the discriminatory portion

14

of the tax, and the focus is on the tax -­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the

16

discriminary -- the discriminary portion of the tax may

17

be regarded as the excess that is imposed on the

18

railroad or the deficiency on -- on the others.

19

MS. SHERRY:

I -- I think it's better

20

understood as -- as -- as speaking specifically to the

21

tax itself, and not to the tax exemption.

22

in the -- at the cert stage when the government

23

suggested a reformulated question presented, it

24

reformulated the question to better focus on the fact

25

that this is a challenge to a discriminatory tax and not
22
Alderson Reporting Company

And in fact,

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to a discriminatory tax exemption.
And I think the State in -- in its

2
3

supplemental brief at the cert stage acknowledged that

4

is the better way and correct way, in fact, to look at

5

these type of challenges and what the appropriate remedy

6

would be.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

You present the case to us

8

as if it's either/or:

disagreement with your position, to say that it doesn't

must be remanded.

MS. SHERRY:

I -- I don't know that the

18

Court has to -- has to go with one or the other, but I

19

think the Court should not hold that it only applies to

20

exemptions to the -- to the extent it's the type of tax

21

where it's generally applicable on its face, but

22

everyone is exempt except for the rail carriers, or

everyone is exempt except for the rail carriers and

And the reason I think that is so is because

2

that's what the language provides in (b)(4).

Certainly

3

Congress was concerned with taxes that would single out

4

a rail carrier, but that wasn't their only concern.

5

an example that I've thought of but I think helps put

6

that into some perspective is:

concede that if instead of imposing a generally

And it makes little sense that they -- that

a State could basically insert that type of tax into a

immunized from any scrutiny.

That's the argument.

I think the reason that

Congress thought it made sense in (1) through (3) and

the reason that this Court in ACF concluded that

because of the language of (1), (2) -- (1) through (3),

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. MAZE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Justice Kennedy, you hit on the proper

10

definition of a tax that discriminates in this case.

11

tax that discriminates under (b)(1), (2), and (3) is a

12

tax that singles out railroads as compared to the

13

general mass of taxpayers.

A

So another tax that

The pivotal question in this case is the one

17

raised by Justice Kagan and Justice Scalia, and that is:

18

Why in the world would Congress, on the one hand, say

19

you can exempt property taxes under this statute, but

20

you can't -- you -- we are prohibiting sales and use tax

21

exemptions, when for 15 years Congress never had a

22

single hearing, a single study, and never even heard a

23

single complaint from the railroads about discriminatory

24

sales and use taxes?

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, it may be because

26

the universe of non-property taxes is -- so infinitely

2

large that there's a much greater room for -- a much

great danger of discrimination.

Right.

We know all States have

But again, I think the

answer is what Justice Ginsberg was pointing out, that

tells a different story.
There are three good reasons that Congress

11
12

would have intended, and the Court should read property

13

tax exemptions and non-property tax exemptions to be

14

read the same way, and the first one is the one that

Justice Ginsberg was pointing out:

businesses from being easy prey in the State

legislature.

The purpose of the

paying the same tax as the local businesses and local

protect them.

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, you are arguing in

2

favor of -- you are arguing in favor of a very

3

idiosyncratic interpretation of the concept of a

4

discriminatory tax, aren't you?
In almost any other context, granting tax

5
6

exemptions to one group but denying them to another

7

group would be viewed as -- if there isn't a good reason

8

for drawing the distinction, as discrimination, wouldn't

9

it?
MR. MAZE:

10

Yes.

I definitely agree, as an

11

abstract matter, an exemption could be a tax that

12

discriminates.

13

through (3) with regard to property taxes is you can

14

grant an exemption, and Congress didn't want to -- and

15

they also told us -­

But what Congress has told us in (1)

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

And it did so with explicit

17

language by -- in -- what is it -- (a)(4), by referring

18

to property that is subject to a property tax levy.

19

MR. MAZE:

Right.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what you're saying is

21

that the ordinary interpretation of the concept of a

22

discriminatory tax should not be applied here, because

23

Congress used specific language to take tax exemptions

24

out of the determination of discrimination under other

25

provisions.

The fact that they specifically took it out of some

provisions but not out of this provision, you think,

7

leads to the implication that they meant to put it in

8

here, too, where they could have easily used language

9

here to put it in.
MR. MAZE:

10

Right.

Well, I would say that

11

Congress wasn't even thinking about non-property tax

12

exemptions when they wrote before.
But the answer is:

13

Our argument is to say

14

that we understand from the structure of the statute as

15

a whole that Congress didn't intend to preempt the

16

State's ability to issue tax exemptions.

kind when it comes to non-property taxes.

the test would be different is not only not clearly

it's hard to figure out in these contexts what is real

hard in a non-obvious case to figure it out?

no way with the property -- the property tax is tough.

thinking about this, they should have told us what

think we should go across the street and have them tell

us.

is the easiest way to do this and the proper way to do

it is simply to read the test to be the same as property

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

No, but it's not quite,

because this is the same problem I was raising.

whether this statute shoves the same problems into two

words that aren't there as to rather leaving those

problems for resolution under the one word that is

MR. MAZE:

And you will find the

2

word "discriminate" at the beginning of each of these

against interstate commerce, meaning they all

discriminate in the same manner.
Again, if you think about it, when you have

a specific provision or several specific provisions

followed by a general, you have to give some independent

effect to the specific provision.
Here's the problem with CSX's argument, the

10

independent effect that they are giving (b)(1), (2), and

prohibition on discriminatory property taxes from the

concerns?
MR. MAZE:

14

because the 5 percent in it only applies to assessment

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

nothing to do with (b)(4) because it can't apply to

you don't have ad valorem assessments, so the details

MR. MAZE:

5

The problem with that is -- that

is CSX's argument -- is now you are reading into

Congress's intent for the statute and the moment you

open up to what Congress's intent for the statute is, we

know that Congress didn't intend to make railroads the

most favored taxpayers in any way.

them on equal footing.

the tax is a positive imposition or a negative one,

6

MR. MAZE:

Right, because that's the way it

7

works for property taxes.

Let me be very clear what we

8

are asking the Court to hold.

9

is what the Court held in that case:

On page 335 of ACF, this
A State may grant

10

exemptions from a generally applicable ad valorem

11

property tax without subjecting the taxation of railroad

12

property to challenge under (b)(4).

13

the Court to do in this case is substitute three words.

14

Ad valorem property is out; sales and use tax is in.

15

All we are asking

There is nothing in the language, the

16

structure or history of the Act that would suggest, much

17

less clearly and manifestly mandate, which is necessary

18

under the clear statement rule, that that rule should be

19

any different.

20

would be illogical to think that Congress spent 15 years

21

worried about one problem and that problem is, is the

22

States were discriminating in property taxes.

23

Again, it would be illogical because it

But there is one clear, easy way to see that

24

the railroads didn't really believe that this was a

25

clear statement against generally applicable sales and
52

use taxes.
The point was made earlier, the railroads

2
3

will sue us all of the time to save money.

It's very

4

telling that the railroads didn't sue any State, despite

5

we have been taxing this way since the 1930s, until the

6

late 80s or early 90s under this theory, because even

7

they when they read this statute, understood it to mean

8

only if we are singled out or targeted.

9

they litigated (b)(4) for the first decade.

That's the way
It's only

10

when they couldn't win those cases any more that they

11

changed what they believed it meant.
But the fact that this was able -- again

12
13

sales and use taxes is their most expensive tax.

14

they say in the -- in the Norfolk Southern opinion, the

15

third largest expenditure of the railroads is diesel

16

fuel.

17

is out there to be taken away -- the taxes, they

18

certainly would have sued us within the first 10 years

19

if this statute clearly said we couldn't do it.

20

nobody believed that is what the statute said, because

MR. PHILLIPS:

Just a -- a few quick points.

First of all,

2

with respect to the reason why the States didn't

3

challenge these tax exemptions earlier; for some of us

4

it's relatively easy to remember what the price of fuel

5

oil was back in the 1970s, it was somewhere in the sort

6

of 10 to 30 cents a gallon range.

7

of that amount of tax, 1 percent exemption of that

8

amount of tax is not a whole lot of money.

9

rates are $4 a gallon, and an exemption under those

Therefore exemptions

Today the

10

circumstances, particularly when you have a fixed rate

11

for your major competitor, gives you a more than

12

substantial incentive to bring an action under these

13

circumstances.

14

The notion that somehow the -- the State has

15

gone down this path because of Federal law has not been

16

true for at least 15 years.

17

and Alabama could have modified its tax however it

18

wanted to and chose not to do so.

19

That statute was repealed

Justice Alito, your hypothetical I think is

20

almost exactly this case, because as my friend

21

indicated, diesel fuel is by far the biggest expense

22

that the railroads have.

23

expense for the motor carriers, and it is a pretty

24

trivial expense for everybody else in the -- in the

25

State of Alabama.

It's also a very significant

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Phillips, do you agree

2

that -- that, generally applicable produces the same -­

3

requires the same inquiry as discriminates?
MR. PHILLIPS:

4

Well, you're ultimately going

5

to have to come down to the same issue, and the problem

6

is, and I -- the reason why I -- I find it hard to

7

accept Justice Kennedy's formulation, which is simply

8

singling out the railroads, because in ACF the Court

9

sort of said well, we will hold that out as a

10

possibility.

11

one thing if you are just singling them out.

12

If you're doing -- you know, it would be

But it seems to me that in a statute like

13

(b)(4), where you -- where you are more broadly, and you

14

don't have the (b)(1) to (b)(3) baggage to deal with

15

property taxes, the idea that you would then limit

16

(b)(4) solely to the situation of singling out is -- is

17

simply not a fair way to characterize it.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So give me a definition

19

of discriminate.

20

I started to ask your adversary, it can't be most

21

favored taxpayer status.

22

Give me your working -- it can't -- as

MR. PHILLIPS:

True?
Right.

It has to be that -­

23

the traditional and common understanding of discriminate

24

is that you treat similarly situated individuals

25

differently without -- with an adequate justification.

it's going to depend on the tax, and I don't know the

answer in this context, because as Justice Alito's

You are going to grant an exemption; you are

favoring them for a reason.

People don't -- States

don't do these willy-nilly.

I think ultimately

13

the way to analyze this is case is what was Congress's

ultimate objective.

a legitimate reason that is fully consistent with

Congress's overall objective, then there is no problem.

There I think if the answer is per se, if

2

you do that you lose.

3

seems to me it depends on how far you want to go in

terms of how much of an exemption you want to play.

6

But the important part of this is still and

7

I think the questions to Mr. Maze reflected is that you

8

should undertake the inquiry to determine whether there

9

is discrimination even if the State happens to use the

10

guise of exemptions as opposed to rate differentials or

11

anything else.

There is nothing special about exemptions
