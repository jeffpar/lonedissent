(10:03 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We will hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 10-238, Arizona Free

5

Enterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett and the

6

consolidated case.

7

Mr. Maurer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM R. MAURER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10
11
12

MR. MAURER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is about whether the government

13

may insert itself into elections and manipulate campaign

14

spending to favor its preferred candidates.

15

does this in a manner that is even more burdensome to

16

free speech than the law at issue in Davis v. FEC.

17

Arizona burdens the law of three groups that pose no

18

threat of corruption under this Court's precedents:

19

Independent expenditure groups, self-financed

20

candidates, and candidates who raise private funds under

21

one of the lowest contribution limits in the Nation.

Arizona

22

Under Davis v. FEC and this Court's

23

well-established precedents, the matching funds

24

provision is unconstitutional and should be struck down.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Maurer, you -- you

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

don't have any objection, you wouldn't have any

2

objection, if Arizona trebled the amount at the outset?

3

In other words, there was a maximum amount, the

4

so-called matching funds; if it were given all in one

5

lump and the publicly funded candidate was told, give it

6

back if you don't use it, that would be okay?

7
8
9

MR. MAURER:

That would be constitutional

under Davis, Your Honor.
This case is not about whether the State of

10

Arizona may provide campaign financing using public

11

funds, nor is it about whether -- the ability of Arizona

12

to ensure that those who receive the public funds can

13

run effective campaigns.

14

whether the government can turn my act of speaking into

15

the vehicle by which my political opponents benefit with

16

direct government subsidies.

17

What this case is about is

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could I try to understand

18

that argument a little bit better, Mr. Maurer?

19

Suppose -- and I know that you think this is not the

20

case, but just bear with the hypothetical.

21

there were, in fact, no deterrent effect on your speech

22

or on the speech of any candidate; in other words, that

23

people thought, well, you know, I would rather be -­

24

have me be the only person who talks, but -- but I would

25

rather talk than be silent, even if it means my opponent
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Suppose that

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

can talk, too, so that there's no deterrent effect from

2

this law whatsoever.

3
4

Would there still be a constitutional
objection?

5

MR. MAURER:

Your Honor, in Davis this Court

6

recognized that a trigger like this, a -- the law that

7

turns the choice of -- my choice to speak effectively

8

into fundraising advantages for my opponents constitutes

9

a substantial burden.

So even if candidates continue to

10

speak, the law constitutes a substantial burden on their

11

speech.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it constitutes a

13

substantial burden, so even if every single person makes

14

a choice, yes, I want to continue to speak, it does not

15

chill any speak -- any speech.

16

what it means to constitute a substantial burden if, in

17

fact, the law does not chill speech.

18

MR. MAURER:

I suppose I'm not sure

Well, Your -- Your Honor, this

19

Court in Davis recognized that when the government

20

reaches into a campaign and attempts to manipulate

21

campaign financing in order to -- in order to basically

22

effectuate the outcome, that constitutes a -- an

23

illegitimate governmental purpose.

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Maurer, suppose -­

suppose the government imposes a fine of $500 for all
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

political speech, and people nonetheless continue to

2

engage in political speech and pay the $500.

3

make the $500 penalty for political speech

4

constitutional?

5

MR. MAURER:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Would that

No, it would not, Your Honor.
But, in fact, there's no

7

such restriction here, is there, Mr. Maurer?

8

restriction at all here; it's more speech all the way

9

around?

10

MR. MAURER:

There's no

I would disagree with that,

11

respectfully, Your Honor.

12

Every time an independent expenditure group or a

13

privately financed candidate speaks above a certain

14

amount, the government creates real penalties for them

15

to have engaged in unfettered political expression.

16

There is a restriction here.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, doesn't the government

17

actually just give a selective subsidy?

18

penalty, it's just saying, in order to -- to run an

19

effective public financing system, when you speak, we're

20

going to give a subsidy over a certain amount.

21

trigger does not trigger a penalty; it triggers a

22

subsidy.

23

MR. MAURER:

It's not a

So the

Your Honor, in Davis, this

24

Court recognized that in the context of competitive

25

elections, which are a zero-sum game, what benefits one
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

candidate will burden, necessarily, or harm the other

2

candidate.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Didn't they call it a

4

subsidy in Davis?

5

think that's what -- what it was characterized as there,

6

too.

7

it.

8
9

I -- if I recall the argument, I

Did they characterize it as a penalty?

MR. MAURER:
in Davis, Your Honor.

I doubt

In fact, it was not a subsidy
The -- the effect of this law is

10

considerably harsher than the law at issue in Davis.

11

Davis, the non-millionaires' candidate still had to go

12

out and actually raise the funds that the Millionaires'

13

Amendment permitted him to raise.

14

provides direct government subsidies, based on my act of

15

speaking, to my political opponents.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In

In this case, the law

There is, though, a

17

significant difference between Davis and this case.

18

What the expenditure triggered in Davis was a

19

discriminatory restriction that would never be allowed

20

in and of itself.

21

something that, as Justice Ginsburg said, the government

22

could do from the get-go, which is subsidize the speech

23

of a candidate who decides to participate in a public

24

financing system.

25

What the law triggers here is

MR. MAURER:

Well, Your Honor, the -- I
8

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

would point out that independent expenditure groups do

2

not have that choice of participating in the subsidy or

3

not.

4

that there was a discriminatory treatment of speakers in

5

the same race, this case -- this law replicates and

6

actually exacerbates the harm that was at issue in

7

Davis.

So to the extent that Davis relied on the fact

8
9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

as-applied challenge from independent speakers in this
lawsuit, is there?

11
12

But there's no particular

MR. MAURER:

Yes, there is, Your Honor.

I

represent two independent expenditure groups.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

My -- my understanding was

14

that the suit was brought as a facial challenge to the

15

entire law.

16
17
18

MR. MAURER:

This is a facial and as-applied

challenge, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In -- in this case, do you

19

think the law is content-neutral within its own

20

universe, which applies just to political speech, so

21

it's not content-neutral in that sense?

22

scheme that it sets up, is it content-neutral?

23

MR. MAURER:

24

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

25

MR. MAURER:

But within the

Absolutely not, Your Honor.
Why?

Because the only thing that

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

will trigger matching funds, particularly for

2

independent expenditure groups, is the content of the

3

message.

4

favor of a privately financed candidate, they will not

5

trigger matching funds.

6

publicly financed candidate, they will trigger matching

7

funds.

8

rejection of the standard this Court enunciated in

9

Citizens United that the government cannot make

If an independent expenditure group speaks in

If they speak against a

That not is only content-based; it is also a

10

distinguishing burdens on the basis of an identity of a

11

speaker.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In Justice Ginsburg's

13

hypothetical -- I'm still trying to think about -­

14

suppose there is one candidate for the -- for the pink

15

party, and then three candidates for the orange party,

16

and all three candidates for the orange party received

17

the lump sum Justice Ginsburg was talking about.

18

there's only one candidate on the other side, and he has

19

to face, or she has to face, three.

20

Is that constitutional?

21

MR. MAURER:

It would not be -- I'm sorry.

22

It would be constitutional under Davis.

23

think that the point, Your Honor, is reflected -­

24
25

JUSTICE SCALIA:
hypothetical.

But

And I -- and I

I didn't understand the

I really didn't.

Alderson Reporting Company

1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

One person is on one side;

2

three people are on the other side.

3

Arizona law, if the three people on the other side are

4

all participating candidates, each of them gets a bonus

5

if there's only one person speaking on behalf of the

6

non-participating candidate, right?

7

MR. MAURER:

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9
10

And under the

Yes, that's absolutely true.
All right.

So $10,000 by

the non-participating candidate triggers off $30,000
against him?

11

MR. MAURER:

That's exactly right.

12

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

All right.

In Justice

13

Ginsburg's hypothetical, wouldn't you have the same

14

problem in different terms, in that one candidate faces

15

three people, all of whom are funded by the -- by the

16

government?

17
18

MR. MAURER:

Well, this case is not

challenging a public financing system, and -­

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

I'm just asking as a

20

theoretical matter whether there would be a

21

constitutional problem in the case that I put under

22

Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical.

23

MR. MAURER:

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

Not under Davis, Your Honor.
How about not under

Buckley?
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

2
3

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

How about under the First

Amendment?
MR. MAURER:

There may be -- there may be

4

instances where a public financing law is so lopsided

5

that it creates a coercive effect, and Buckley was quite

6

clear that one of the things that was acceptable about

7

the public financing system at issue in that case was

8

that it was voluntary.

9

But in this case, we're dealing with a very

10

different type of First Amendment harm.

11

matters, Your Honors.

12

It is exactly the same kind of trigger -­

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The trigger

It is, in fact, determinative.

I thought that the point

14

of Buckley was that the public funding, which you can

15

accept or reject, the justification for it was that it

16

increased rather than decreased speech.

17

think you were quite right in recognizing that matching

18

funds, this Court has said, do not conflict with the -­

19

with the First Amendment.

20
21
22
23

MR. MAURER:

And the -- I

Your Honor, if I -- if I had

said that, I was mistaken.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Not matching funds.

Public funding.

24

MR. MAURER:

Oh, okay.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Public funding.

12
Alderson Reporting Company

And so

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

if it turns out that the States -- public funding isn't

2

being used because -- because the limits are low, and

3

yet the, the State wants to conserve the public fisc.

4

So instead of just increasing the amount at the outset,

5

it says the -- the -- the object is the same, but we're

6

economizing by not giving it out in one lump sum, we're

7

giving it out in installments.

8

MR. MAURER:

Your Honor, in Riley v.

9

National Federation of the Blind, this Court recognized

10

that -- that the government cannot sacrifice speech for

11

efficiency, and what -- if -- if we accept the holding

12

of Davis v. FEC and accept that that is still a holding

13

that is viable under the First Amendment, then what

14

the -- the position of the Respondents is, is that they,

15

in fact, can sacrifice free speech in order to be more

16

efficient, but -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can you -- can you tell me

18

on that, because I take it you agree with Justice

19

Ginsburg about Buckley.

20

public financing is a means of eliminating the improper

21

influence of large private corporations, furthers a

22

significant government interest.

In Buckley the Court says,

23

We both agree that's what it says?

24

MR. MAURER:

25

Yes, that's what Buckley says,

Your Honor.
13
Alderson Reporting Company

2

JUSTICE BREYER:
means.

I take it that's what it

All right.

3

Now, your objection is how much do they pay.

4

MR. MAURER:

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.
Here they have a trigger,

6

not -- not quantitatively.

But here they say it's okay

7

to finance a public candidate publicly, okay to do that.

8

Now, what we're going to do is give them a million

9

dollars to start with, up to $3 million to spend,

10

depending on how much their opponents spend.

11

think that's unconstitutional?

12
13

My question to you is, what would be a
constitutional system in your opinion?

14

MR. MAURER:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

16

MR. MAURER:

Now, you

Your Honor -­
That would be helpful.

I'm not interested in

the amount being paid in installments.

21

opinion, would be a constitutional system?

22

to repeat my question, which I just did, but I want that

23

answer, your answer to that.

24
25

I'm interested in your opinion.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

What, in your

be based upon Buckley, however.

(Laughter.)

2

MR. MAURER:

Yes, the presidential financing

3

system is constitutional, Your Honor.

4

also -- I would also respectfully disagree with your

5

characterization that the -- the nature of our objection

6

has to do with the fact that our opponents are receiving

7

money.

8
9

And I would

The problem here is not that our -- the
opponents of my clients are receiving money.

It's what

10

triggers that, and what triggers that is my exercise of

11

my free speech rights.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would there be anything

13

unconstitutional about a system that worked roughly like

14

this?

15

election cycle, the commission that supervises this law

16

would make a calculation about how much money would be

17

needed for a candidate in a gubernatorial race or a

18

State senate race or an assembly race, if that's what

19

it's called in Arizona, to get that candidate's message

20

out to the electorate, and that would be the amount of

21

the public funding, period.

22

At the beginning -- at some point prior to each

MR. MAURER:

That would be a constitutional

23

system, Your Honor.

There is no constitutional

24

objection or at least we're not raising any

25

constitutional objection to the idea that there is a -­
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that public financing means that people can't run

2

effective races.

3

with sufficient funds to run an effective race.

4

what you cannot do is exactly what Arizona has done,

5

which is turn my act of speaking into the vehicle by

6

which my political opponents benefit.

7

You can have a public financing system

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But

But that's interesting,

8

Mr. Maurer, because I don't see all that much of a

9

difference between Justice Alito's hypothetical and the

10

facts here.

11

Alito's hypothetical would be constitutional, even

12

though under Justice Alito's hypothetical the State is

13

trying to figure out how much money it takes to run a

14

competitive race and giving people who enter the public

15

financing system that amount of money.

16

what the State is doing here, but it's doing it in

17

actually a more accurate way.

18

In other words, you said that Justice

That's exactly

So if Justice Alito's hypothetical is

19

constitutional, why isn't this?

20

do the same thing, which is to put sufficient money in

21

the hands of people who enter the public financing

22

system in order to run a competitive race.

23

MR. MAURER:

They're both trying to

Your Honor, one of the things

24

that would distinguish that is that it -- Justice

25

Alito's hypothetical completely divorces the amount of
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the grant from my political activity or the political

2

activity of people who don't want to or cannot take

3

public funds in Arizona.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I think, to the

5

contrary, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, just the

6

State is estimating how much a person will spend.

7

the State is measuring how much a person will spend.

8

The only difference is that one is more accurate than

9

the other.

10

MR. MAURER:

Here

Your Honor, I believe the

11

distinction would lie in the fact that the purpose of

12

this law is not to provide necessarily the ability of

13

candidates to run effective publicly financed campaigns.

14

The purpose of this law is to limit spending in

15

elections and to level the playing field.

16

Alito's hypothetical -­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think the purpose of this

18

law is to prevent corruption.

19

of all public financing systems are.

20

MR. MAURER:

Justice

That's what the purpose

Your Honor, I would

21

respectfully disagree that the purpose of this law is to

22

prevent corruption, and I would like to read from the

23

executive director of the Clean Elections Commission who

24

said that:

25

the Clean Elections Act is to equalize the playing field

"It cannot be disputed that the purpose of

17
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and to give participating candidates equal opportunity

2

to get their message out," which is at Joint Appendix

3

236.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Maurer, some

5

people may use certain buzz words and other people don't

6

use those buzz words, but isn't it true that for 40

7

years what public financing systems have been based upon

8

is the idea that when there is a lot of private money

9

floating around the political system, that candidates

10

and then public office holders get beholden to various

11

people who are giving that money and make actions based

12

on how much they receive from those people, and that's

13

the idea of a public financing system is to try to

14

prevent that?

15

MR. MAURER:

Well, that is the basis of

16

public financing systems in general, but this system

17

does not actually address that because this Court -­

18

JUSTICE SCALIA:

We have the contrary argue

19

here.

20

cases that we've heard argued, it was asserted that the

21

purpose was to level the playing field, and that that

22

was an entirely valid purpose.

23

public financing laws have had as their purpose simply

24

to avoid corruption.

25

I'm sure that in some of the public financing

MR. MAURER:

I'm unaware that all

Your Honor, it -- when this law

was promoted, when it was drafted, when it was

propagated and -- and -- and campaigned about to the

3

people of the State of Arizona, it was presented as

4

doing two things:

5

limiting spending in campaigns.

6

Leveling the playing field and

It wasn't until this Court's decision in -­

in Davis that the State of Arizona suddenly discovered

that the purpose of the law was actually to fight

corruption or the primary purpose was to actually fight

corruption.

What about all the

12

background, there had been a number of scandals in

Arizona, there had been vote buying?

that was part of the origin of this law, was not as you

now say had nothing to do with corruption.

emerged out of that, those startling incidents of people

actually selling their votes.

How does it -- how does it combat corruption

whole purpose is to suppress the contribution of $10

17

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Your Honor, Arizona's

19

triggered matching funds provision combats corruption in

20

the same manner that public funding combats corruption,

21

because that -- the law is designed to encourage

22

candidates to accept public funding because it offers a

23

viable public funding option to them while conserving

24

the State's resources.

25

anticorruption rationale in two fundamental ways.

And public funding serves the

28
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

First, it frees the candidates who accept public funding

2

from the need to accept potentially corrupting private

3

contributions.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, there are States that

5

have public funding without having a matching fund

6

provision.

7

these two regimes.

9

minus the matching fund provision.

I would appreciate it if you would compare
The first is exactly what Arizona

The second is exactly what Arizona has now
So under the second

10

one you have very strict contribution limits, and you

11

have reporting of all contributions.

12

addition of the matching fund provision serve an

13

anticorruption interest?

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

Now, why does the

Well, Your Honor, I think for

15

the same reasons I think that are implicit in the

16

Buckley Court's upholding of public funding at the same

17

time that the Court upheld contribution limits and

18

disclosure requirements, I think implicitly therefore

19

holding that the three could go together, serving the

20

anticorruption interests.

21

first, by, first by -- first by freeing, as I said,

22

freeing the publicly funded candidates from the need

23

even to take the limited privately -- private

24

contributions that would be allowed under the law, and

25

which this Court has never held there's a minimum at

And I think it does that,

29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

which that no longer conceivably becomes corrupting.

2

But secondly, it -- it combats corruption by

3

providing for more candidates running, more political

speech, and more electoral competition, all of which

have happened in Arizona.

this is a way of encouraging candidates to take the

Yes.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Would it encourage

13

more candidates to do that if you doubled the amount

14

that was available for every additional amount that the

15

privately financed candidate spends?

16

over the amount and the publicly financed candidate gets

$2,000.

MR. PHILLIPS:

It would encourage them more,

Your Honor.

a State or Congress did to encourage public funding

22

would necessarily be constitutional.

23

question would be different if it were a two to one or,

24

to make a more stark contrast, a ten to one match.

25

think that would raise multiple questions.

It's not our contention that anything that

30
Alderson Reporting Company

I think the

I

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

One question would be, looking at the

2

statute in its entirety, has the public funding scheme

3

become coercive rather than voluntary?

4

the question whether the purpose of the law were really

5

to simply provide viable funding to candidates -­

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It would raise

But that's kind of

7

an odd line to find in the First Amendment, isn't it?

8

That you get a 100 percent matching as opposed to, say,

9

110 percent or 150 percent?

10
11

Somewhere in the First

Amendment the line is drawn on the amount?
MR. PHILLIPS:

I think somewhere in the

12

First Amendment there is a line, Your Honor, implicit in

13

Buckley, where a public funding law provides such

14

substantial benefits without sufficient countervailing

15

burdens to publicly funded candidates that it becomes

16

coercive rather than voluntary, and therefore you have

17

coerced someone into accepting a spending limit, which I

18

believe would be certainly subject to strict scrutiny

19

and almost surely unconstitutional.

20

-- the Court would need to assess that in each instance,

21

and I think it could be done.

22

that here you have a coercive system.

23

candidates don't accept public funding, and most of

24

those who don't and accept -- and face publicly funded

25

candidates actually win.

Certainly it doesn't work in

the sense, Your Honor, if the goal were for everyone to

accept public funding, it doesn't work in that sense.

5

But it certainly works in the sense that two-thirds of

the candidates do, and it works in the sense that there

You would expect somebody who

it's going to be preferable.

There may be some few candidates, although

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

persuasiveness -- your focus on persuasiveness is a

19

particular view of the political process that may not be

20

applicable in every case.

21

sometimes tell you that it's not persuasion, but simply

22

playing to your base, getting them more actively

23

involved.

24

that people are going to sit down and just regard which

25

one is persuasive.

Political scientists

So it's not the somewhat more academic view

Is that a permissible objective for
38
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the State to pursue, to value a particular view of the

2

electoral process over another?

3

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Your Honor, I don't

4

think that the State is doing that.

What I'm addressing

5

is the effect of the law, and I think Your Honor makes a

6

good point, which is that they assume, Petitioners

7

assume, that essentially this is a zero-sum game and

8

that because if I spend $10,000 the other guy is going

9

to get $10,000 to respond, that somehow that's a wash.

10

Well, it's not a wash, first, because I think my speech

11

is more persuasive so I'm going to do it anyway, because

12

I'd rather get it out there; and secondly, because I may

13

be spending my $10,000 on getting out my voters, and I

14

need to do that regardless.

15

And that's why you don't see in the

16

statistics any evidence that this actually suppresses

17

speech.

18

who would opt for less speech because it's strategically

19

better for them, but we would submit that that -­

20

And as I said, there may be some few candidates

JUSTICE ALITO:

But even if it is the case

21

that those candidates who choose not to participate are

22

willing to spend additional money even though it

23

triggers matching funds, I don't see what that proves.

24

A candidate who is deciding whether to participate or

25

not presumably makes a calculation at the beginning:
39
Alderson Reporting Company

Do

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

I want to spend more than the matching fund amount, even

2

though I know that if I do that, the other side will get

3

additional money?

4

Now, if they say, no, I don't -- I'm not

5

going to do it under those circumstances, they will take

6

the public financing.

7

financing, it means they probably made a decision going

8

in that they're going to -- they're going to be one of

9

those who is willing to suffer the consequences of

10

spending over the amount.

11

don't see what that proves.

12

So I don't see what this -- I

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, Your Honor, I think

13

what it proves is that you -- the key point in here is

14

that initial choice that is voluntarily made by each of

15

the candidates, whether the system of public financing

16

under which you may receive matching funds is better for

17

them or whether the system -­

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could I ask z question that

19

goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, which I don't

20

think you fully had a chance to -- or fully answered?

21

And that has to do with the independent expenditures.

22

Let's say there are two candidates running

23

for governor, and one who is a participating candidate

24

is taking a position on a very controversial Arizona

25

issue with which I disagree, and the other is a
40
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

non-participating candidate who is taking a position on

2

that controversial issue and I agree with that.

3

Now, if I choose to run an ad, pay for an ad

4

supporting the non-participating candidate, I know that

5

the -- the candidate that I dislike on that issue is

6

going to get an additional amount of funds, and -- but

7

if I choose to run an ad supporting the participating

8

candidate, the opposite doesn't happen.

9

that a clear-cut discrimination based on the content of

10

Now, why isn't

speech?

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because, Your Honor, the

12

discrimination, if you want to -- if you call it

13

discrimination or different treatment, is based on the

14

initial choices of the candidates as to how they're

15

going to finance their campaigns.

16

content of the speech.

17

It's not based on the

There's -- matching funds do not turn in any

18

way on the ideas or the messages or the viewpoints or

19

the subject matter of the candidate or the independent

20

group's speech or on the identity of the speaker.

21

turns entirely on what choice the candidate made at the

22

outset.

23

It

And it is analogous, in a sense, Your Honor,

24

to the situation that's faced by a contributor who is

25

deciding whether to contribute, for example, to a
41
Alderson Reporting Company

501(c)(3) or a 501(c)(4) organization.

If they

2

contribute to the organization that can lobby, they

3

don't get a tax deduction.

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if I'm the

I haven't made a choice at the beginning.

about is the issue that's being debated between these

9

two candidates.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

I haven't
What I care

And -- and, Your Honor, two

11

points.

You're free, of course, to run an ad that

12

addresses the issue without expressly advocating for or

13

against any candidate without triggering matching funds.

14

And secondly, the candidates made a choice, and if

15

you're the person who is -- who supports the

16

participating candidate, you can't make a contribution

17

to that candidate, while you could to the other

18

candidate because of the choice that was made.

19

can be responded to, if you run an ad criticizing the

20

non-participating candidate, you can be responded to

21

with unlimited amounts of money from -- taken from a

22

political party, the person's own money, whereas, too,

23

if you attack a privately financed candidate, you would

24

only be subject to being potentially responded to with

25

limited matching funds.
42
Alderson Reporting Company

And you

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

And it all flows from the voluntary choice

2

that is made at the outset by the candidates about which

3

system of financing is better for them.

4

And this is a system, the matching funds

5

system, is a mechanism that the State uses in order to

6

be able to offer viable public funding to candidates

7

without wasting public resources, and both the logic and

8

evidence demonstrates that it is, in fact, effective,

9

both at promoting speech by encouraging candidates to

10

run and, indeed, particularly resulting in more

11

competitive races for incumbents -- against incumbents

12

in Arizona and promoting speech.

13

And I would just like briefly to address

14

Justice Alito's question about the ex ante measurement

15

of the funds.

16

not relevant because we're not in -- should not be in

17

strict scrutiny and therefore don't need to show this is

18

the least restrictive means, Your Honor.

19

Now, of course, we would submit that it's

But, Justice Alito, an ex ante system would

20

run substantial risks of underfunding or overfunding

21

races, and in particular -- and therefore wouldn't serve

22

the State's interest in saving money or in properly

23

measuring -- but, in particular, would run the risk of

24

having an incumbent who might have been in office for

25

several terms unopposed and not having spent any money
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

in those races, and now you are measuring how much his

2

possibly now viable challenger will get in public

3

funding based upon some minuscule amount of money that

4

the incumbent has needed to spend.

5

So I think that that would not serve the

6

State's interests in ensuring the candidates actually

7

have viable public funding.

8

And I see my time has expired.

Thank you.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,
SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. JAY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
I would like to begin, if I may, with

18

Justice Alito's question to Mr. Phillips about whether

19

the independent expenditure aspect of this statute is

20

content-neutral, and I think that, looking at this in

21

the context of a multi-candidate race, which most races

22

in Arizona are, is important to set the context, because

23

most races in Arizona are not one candidate against

24

another candidate.

25

Every House district in Arizona has two -­
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

has two members, so every general election has at least

2

four candidates.

3

running an ad in support of a publicly financed

4

candidate does not trigger matching funds.

5

not on what the ad says, not even on who the candidate

6

is being supported, but on whether another candidate in

7

the race takes public financing.

8

support one publicly financed candidate may trigger

9

matching funds to another.

It depends

discrimination.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Jay -- Mr. Jay, do you

12

agree with the -- the assertion of Mr. Phillips that

13

this does not favor incumbents?

14

I would have thought that if I'm an

15

incumbent with name recognition, I would love to be able

16

to not raise any money and just -- just take the public

17

funding, knowing that if worse comes to worse and I have

18

an opponent who does have a lot of independent

19

expenditures for him, I'll be able to get that money

20

free from the State.

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

endorse the sentiment, because I think that the

2

Petitioners' evidence in this case, the Petitioners who

3

were incumbent office holders and say that they did not

4

spend money because they were -- they feared the

5

response that would be paid for by matching funds, I

6

think their own evidence, including the declaration that

7

they put in at Joint Appendix 364, says:

8

the spending down, me as an incumbent, I have a

9

tremendous advantage.

If I can keep

That's an Arizona legislator

talking to one of the -- talking to the -- to one of

11

their experts.

12

And that's because -- and a race that

13

features low dollar amounts on both sides often

14

advantages an incumbent.

15

that is the purpose of the matching funds provision, to

16

allow -- to allow challengers to be competitively

17

funded.

18

reason that -­

That's the purpose of the initial grant.

The

depends upon whether you believe that this scheme will

21

keep the expenditures down, or rather, will elevate the

22

expenditures.

people from making contributions, it will keep the

24

expenditures down.

25

And if you believe that it will deter

3

funds provision provides a formula for giving the

4

publicly funded candidate as much money as the private

5

-- as the privately funded candidate that they're

6

competing with.

7

both sides are for more speech, for both sides to get

8

out their message, run their ads, and persuade the

9

voters.

When there are competitive races, the matching

And in most cases the incentives on

In some cases -- and we submit that the

11

anecdotal evidence the Petitioners have submitted

12

touches on these cases -- the privately funded candidate

13

may have an incentive to keep spending down, but we

14

don't think that's true systemically under this system.

15

We think that the -- that the public financing in

16

general and the matching funds provision in particular

17

facilitates speech, because the only consequence of

18

running an independent expenditure, for example, at

19

most, the consequence is that another party will get to

20

run a responsive ad, and the sum of speech will be

21

increased.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, do you

23

agree that under our precedents, leveling the playing

field for candidates is not a legitimate State purpose?

25

MR. JAY:

We do, Mr. Chief Justice.
47

Alderson Reporting Company

That -­

that, of course, is not what's at work here.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I checked the

Citizens' Clean Elections Commission website this

the Citizens Clean Elections Commission says on its web

10

site I think isn't dispositive of what the voters of

11

Arizona had in mind when they passed this initiative.

12

The Court -- this Court has recognized since Buckley

13

that public financing serves a valid anticorruption

14

purpose, and it does so because it eliminates the

15

influence of private contributions on the candidates who

16

take public financing.

17

And it -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But would you agree that the

18

matching fund provision by itself does not serve an

anticorruption purpose?

20

MR. JAY:

Well, Justice Alito, the matching

21

funds provision the State of Arizona has concluded is an

22

important way of ensuring that candidates will take

public financing, because it is a formula of ensuring

that candidates will have enough money to run

JUSTICE BREYER:

And what about -- it's a

general question.

Answer this if you wish.

Don't if

4

you don't want to, and the same goes for your opponent.

5

But as I hear this argument, what's going through my

6

mind is we are deeply into the details of a very complex

7

bill.

8

cannot possibly test each provision which is related to

9

the others on such a test of whether it equalizes or

McCain-Feingold is hundreds of pages, and we

incentivizes or some other thing, because the answer is

normally we don't know.

13

than to subject these things to death by a thousand

14

cuts, because we don't know what will happen when we

start tinkering with one provision rather than another.

the evidence is replete with examples of people not

making expenditures such as Tony Bouie, who refrained

2

from sending out mailers, making auto calls or

3

distributing information, John McComish also had a

4

similar response, the Arizona Taxpayers Action Committee

5

did not engage in a particular campaign because it would

6

have triggered matching funds.

7

But ultimately when we get right down to it,

8

though, the question is does this create the same kind

9

of burden in -- as -- as in Davis, and I could go

10

through point by point, Mr. Phillips, and Mr. Jay's

11

argument, but they're all answered by Davis.

12

Davis recognized that this type of

13

interference with the -- with the voters' decision as to

14

who to elect to office and the purpose of doing that in

15

order to raise the voices of those the government thinks

16

is speaking too little and muffle the voices of those

17

the government think is speaking too much is completely

18

illegitimate.

19

This case is determined by Davis.

For

20

instance, the -- the argument that Mr. Phillips made

21

that speech has gone up in -- in Arizona is -- is undone

22

by Davis, which recognizes that increases in the

23

aggregate of speech cannot justify restrictions on

individual First Amendment rights.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Maurer, Davis starts off

would have put many independent funders to a real
