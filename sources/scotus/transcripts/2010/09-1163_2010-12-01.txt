ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. MANN

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. MANN:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
There are four points I would like to make

11
12

this morning.

13

dictates an extremely narrow category of materials,

14

those related solely to internal personnel policies and

15

rules.

16

First, the plain language of Exemption 2

Second, even if you look beyond the plain

17

language and look to the legislative history, the

18

legislative history is focused, and the additional

19

legislative history from the House is focused, only on

20

law enforcement or investigatory materials, items that

21

were covered through the 1986 amendments to FOIA, making

22

any additional judicial High 2 unnecessary.

23

The third point:

Because of FOIA's purpose,

24

if you find that the language, the plain language, is

25

not clear or if you find that the legislative history
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

4
1

isn't sufficient, then the focus must be on an

2

interpretation that supports disclosure, not secrecy.
And finally, Congress, in enacting FOIA,

3
4

conducted the balancing.

In reserve for it, itself, the

5

authority to add to or expand FOIA through Exemption 3.

6

It did not leave agency discretion available for the

7

agencies to decide what documents they can provide or

8

not.
Moving into our first argument, the plain

9
10

language.

11

solely to internal personnel rules and procedures -­

12

rules and practices.

13

"related solely" on purpose.

14

view.

15

isolation, perhaps you could see that there is some

16

conflict between them.

17

"solely" is extremely narrow.

18

as they should be in this statute, "related solely" is

19

an extremely narrow class of documents.

20

At issue is a very short sentence related

Congress chose to use the words
That's an extremely narrow

Now, we understand if you look at the words in

"Related" could be broad;

JUSTICE ALITO:

But when read together,

Could I ask you this?

The

21

D.C. Circuit's decision in Crooker has been the leading

22

decision in this -- on this issue for nearly 30 years,

23

and there has been a great deal of reliance on it,

24

certainly by the lower courts in general, and perhaps

25

also by Congress and by the executive branch.
Alderson Reporting Company

Do you

Official

5
1

think there's anything to be said for deference to that

2

decision based on the fact that it has been -- there has

3

been reliance on it to such a great degree for such a

4

period of time?
MR. MANN:

5

No, Your Honor.

When Crooker

6

came down, the court was faced with an extremely -- a

7

circumstance dealing with these FBI or ATF search and

8

seizure manuals, and the court adopted and created the

9

High 2 exemption.

But, again, we believe in 1986

10

Congress dealt with that expressly, explicitly, and took

11

the exact same language and inserted into a stand-alone

12

exemption, Exemption 7(A), making Crooker no longer

13

needed or necessary.

In the past, the Court -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

I ask -- I ask the question

15

because the world has changed in a lot of ways since

16

1981, and one is that there is now, I think, much

17

greater concern about the disclosure of information that

18

has perhaps profound security implications.

19

not as much of a concern in -- in 1981.

That was

If you think about, for example, suppose

20
21

there's a Federal building with a hallway that is

22

accessible only to somebody who has a code key.

23

that be -- is that -- does that have to be disclosed

24

under FOIA?

25

building that would disclose the size of the bomb that

Would

Or architectural plans for a Federal

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

6
1

would be necessary to bring the building down or bring

2

part of the building down; is there any FOIA exemption

3

that covers things like that?
MR. MANN:

4

Well, Your Honor, there could be

5

a variety of FOIA exemptions -- it could fit under 7

6

depending on whether or not it's law enforcement­

7

related.

8

guarding a facility or guarding individuals, perhaps

9

that would be law enforcement.

For example, if it's FBI instructions on

And if it's protecting

10

individuals within that building, under 7(F).

Or it

11

could be something addressed specifically through

12

Exemption 3.
And coming to your original -- the original

13
14

part of your question, that times have changed, we

15

recognize that; and Congress recognized certainly that

16

times could and would change when it adopted it, and

17

that's why we believe Congress kept for itself

18

Exemption 3.

MR. MANN:

So you don't need to

We don't need to reject -- under

Judge Fletcher's viewpoint, we did not need to reject

10

High 2 to prevail.

11

more importantly, Crooker -- again, we think this

12

language -- this case rises and falls on the plain

13

language of the statute, and Crooker was an expansion of

14

that, and we need to accept that Crooker was an

15

expansion of that.

MR. MANN:

Everyone but Judge Wilkey

look at on that.

First of all, Congress originally did

9

10

and 7 covered all of the language that we would be

12

13

superfluous.
And then a final point and I think a very

14
15

So really, if you're still reading

important point -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

Well, you had a different

17

Congress.

I mean, the Congress that passed the law is

18

not necessarily the same Congress that -- that failed to

19

amend the law.

20

only for so long as the Congress that passed them is

21

sitting, and then the failure to make any changes in

22

light of judicial decisions by later Congresses

23

effectively amends the law?

Are we to consider laws to be in effect

24

MR. MANN:

No.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

proposition.
MR. MANN:

2

No, that's not the proposition

3

I'm making.

The proposition I'm making is that when the

4

1986 -- '84 through '86 took place, and they looked at

5

this and they saw the issue with Jordan and they saw the

6

issue with Crooker, their decision was to consolidate

7

that exemption, what had been called "High 2," into

8

7(A).
JUSTICE BREYER:

9

How do you know?

What we

10

have is 7(E) in front of us; 7(E) says we want to be

11

sure something like Crooker's interpretation of 2

12

applies with law enforcement.

they apply it with law enforcement.

It's simply a case -- so

Crooker to apply to the Fed for example, or to the Navy,

18

or to -- which is here storing -- it's storing

19

explosives.

20

one way or the other from the fact they passed 7.

Why would -- I mean, I can't get anything

21

MR. MANN:

Well, I should -­

Why should I get one rather

23

than the other?

an argument the other side -- that they make.

5

MR. MANN:

Well, my answer is, is you are

6

correct that they did not read -- they did not

7

8

we can do is look at what they did in its totality.

Are you interpreting -­

6

7

JUSTICE SCALIA:

8

-- but there could be an

infinitude of reasons why a law is not passed.
MR. MANN:

9

I accept that, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Do you know of any case in

11

which the failure of Congress to amend a law in order to

12

overrule a court decision other than a decision of this

13

Court has been held to be an implicit approval of that

14

decision?

15

oh, there was a line of court of appeals cases, and

16

since Congress failed to amend the statute to take

17

account of those court of appeals cases, Congress must

18

have approved them.

Do we have a single case where we've said,

Do we have any case like that?

No, we don't, Your Honor.

20

JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. MANN:

I don't know of any.

Your Honor, but I would like to

22

make one additional point on this.

23

what Congress did in 1986 -- and, again, they're not

24

telling us this, but we can look at the statute -- what

25

they've done is preserve once again that clear, distinct

7

clear, sharp dividing line.

8

9

dividing line to let agencies know -­

We don't need to go back to it to
We

So there's a

And as this Court said in

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

That's an

Counsel, in Rose we

11

talked about a legitimate public purpose in seeking

12

information.

13

which is at what point does -- is it legitimate for the

14

public to seek information, internal information,

15

relating to the rules and practices of personnel?

16

the public seek information that places the community at

17

a severe security risk?

18

that that kind of information, given our line of

19

reasoning in Rose, could not be legitimate public

20

information?

21

I tie my question to Justice Alito's,

MR. MANN:

Can

Is it possible for us to say

But it does not have to be using

22

the Exemption 2, as it's stated, for -- for the internal

23

personnel policies.

24

that some materials that might create a security risk

25

can be protected.

There are other reasons and ways

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

13
1

Congress has -- there's over 150 -- I

2

believe the number currently is 153 statutes that

3

they've enacted under section 3, using section 3.

4

includes as recently as last -- last year, when the

5

Department of Defense v. ACLU case came before you.

6

Congress stepped -- that was dealing with the Abu Ghraib

7

photos.

8

the Securities Act to exempt those documents

9

specifically from release, in order to protect.

That

Congress stepped in and passed an amendment to

10

that was using the proper authority.

11

an agency to go back and rely on an "Expand 2,"

12

Exemption 2.

And

It didn't require

And that's the danger of the expansion we're

13
14

looking at, is it allows Exemption 2 to be used for an

15

open-ended -- any time an agency feels it may be

16

appropriate that it might not want to release something,

17

it can rely on Exemption 2.

18

Congress tried from the beginning to preserve for itself

19

that discretion and that authority and to remove the

20

discretion.

21

That was never the intent.

As we point out -- as we've set out for you

22

in our briefs, if you look at the legislative history,

23

many of the agencies and Department of Justice that came

24

before Congress asked for that discretion, and Congress

25

did not give it to them.

They reserved, and, instead,

Alderson Reporting Company

So what we're saying is that you do not need

2
3

to -- there may be reasons that you want to take high

4

security information and have it isolated from the

5

public's review, but it's not through using an exemption

6

that was really designed for minor internal matters.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

Of course, if that's -- if

8

that's the outcome of this case and if you prevail, that

9

would mean that more things will be classified and

10

withdrawn wholly from scrutiny; whereas, if other

11

exemptions are used, they can be shared to a greater

12

extent.

withholding more information from more people.

I mean, your four arguments

seem to me to be the same arguments that Judge Edwards

8

sense that what Judge Edwards was looking at and the

Crooker decision was looking at was a specific group of

documents, these manuals of policy and procedure.

MR. MANN:

5

Your Honor, the issue here is not

6

so much Crooker as it is what the Ninth Circuit has done

7

to, we believe, expand Crooker, because you're correct.

8

I mean, obviously, the Crooker decision was a

9

well-written, long, and very detailed decision, both the

10

en banc as well as the dissents, but -- the dissent.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So even under a

Mr. Mann, I thought you

disagreed with the premise of Justice Ginsburg's

10

question; that is, that you assert that the language

11

related solely to the internal personnel rules and

12

practices of an agency is quite clear.

13

MR. MANN:

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

15
16

I do.
I thought maybe you were

abandoning that.
MR. MANN:

No, no.

I mean, I -- but what I

17

was saying was that we do believe it was quite clear.

18

But if -- even if you went beyond, which obviously they

19

did in Crooker, and obviously you could argue from the

20

House report -- even if you go beyond, it's still a

21

limited category that does not reach so broad as what

22

the Ninth Circuit has opened up here, and as what the

23

Navy is arguing before you now, which is even broader

24

than what the Ninth Circuit reached.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

How is it -- how is it

broader?

I -- I looked for the words.

them, and you can point them out.

I just missed

When I read about the circumvention, what

Crooker says is:

"We hold that since the document for

5

which disclosure is sought meets the test of

6

'predominant internality,' and since its disclosure

7

significantly risks circumvention of federal statutes or

8

regulations," it is exempt.
It didn't say anything about circumvention

9
10

because there is a regulated entity and it is that

11

regulated entity that will circumvent.

12

circumvention, as far as I saw.

19

if we're looking at Crooker, I just read the words

20

"would there be circumvention" -­

21

MR. MANN:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
-- and it seemed to me, in

23

this case, the Navy has plans and they use those plans

24

to store munitions safely, and the risk that they worry

25

about is someone will get ahold of the plans and use the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

positions of those munitions in order to make them

2

unsafe, for example, blowing them up.

3

like a very serious circumvention of what the regulation

4

was there for.

5

MR. MANN:

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that seemed

But not by the regulator -­
That's correct, and I

7

didn't find anything in Crooker that said -- and I don't

know why you'd have such a theory.

9

the point of the theory would be, that you would care

I don't know what

10

whether blowing up took place by somebody who

11

technically was regulated by the Navy or blowing up took

12

place by some other person, whom they're worried about.

13

MR. MANN:

Because the basis -- it's -- the

14

basis for that is, again, this Court's language in Rose,

15

where it looked at -- again, we're going back to a very

16

few words in the House report, and the House report is

17

looking at these guidelines and manuals of procedure for

18

government investigators or examiners.

19

This Court took that language and looked at

20

it and pointed to -- well, and it's a logical extension,

21

that if we're looking at it from these investigators or

22

examiners, what we're concerned about is people being

investigated or examined.

2.

that means that the records at issue must be properly

maintained within an agency and not for general release.

The first is the internal element, and we believe

MR. YANG:

Well, if the Court were to

provide us with the opportunity, I think the Navy could

15

consider that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

No, I mean, isn't it

17

the case when a government agency has to go through its

18

records in response to a FOIA request and comes upon

19

records that would otherwise be disclosable, they can at

20

that point say we're going to classify this so we don't

MR. YANG:

22

The relevant executive order that

governs classification does allow classification of

materials which have been disseminated beyond the

difference if you look at the term "personnel files and

MR. YANG:

20

Well, it's certainly one reading.

21

We think that personnel rules and practices of an agency

22

can fairly encompass instructions that you provide to

23

personnel.

personnel that they are to appear at work at 9:00 and

agency promulgates are supposed to be enforced by the
personnel of the agency.

11

MR. YANG:

12

JUSTICE SCALIA:

13

All the rules of an agency

I should think so.
They become personnel rules

and practices.
MR. YANG:

14

The focus on personnel in the

15

statute helps to distinguish between rules and practices

16

which govern personnel, and rules and practices which

17

also are there to govern the public in its interactions

18

with the agency.

19

that we initially started on.

20

you're related solely to the internal personnel rules

21

and practices of the agency, it -- it extends just

22

beyond just the rules and practices of themselves, but

23

it makes sure that the focus -- solely -- is still on

24

personnel.

25

And this goes back to the question
"Relates solely" -- when

So there are things -- for instance, if the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

34
1

rule is that you need to file a FOIA request in a

2

certain way, and the agency instructs personnel to

3

process it in a certain way, those rules also would

4

affect the public.

5

there is a dual purpose, a dual function of the rule or

6

practice, it would not relate solely to the internal

7

personnel rules.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8
9

The public would need to comply.

If

Well, that begs, I

think, Justice Scalia's question.

One could argue that

10

everything that the agency develops except rules telling

11

the public how to come to the agency with a complaint,

12

et cetera -- virtually everything will govern either the

13

internal personnel practices or the agency's practices

14

vis-à-vis the public.

15

MR. YANG:

But not everything that the

16

agency does will relate solely or exclusively to govern

17

the internal personnel -- the rules and practices for

18

personnel.

19

both instructs personnel how to do their duties and it's

20

also something that the public must take into account -­

When there is a dual function, that is, it

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

focus of the exemption in context -- the exemption

18

applies to matters that relate solely to the internal

helps to focus the inquiry on the rules, and, again,

only relating solely, on rules that govern agency

when Congress drafted this statute, it initially started

personnel.

In the report that effectuated that change,

11

the explanation and the only explanation was that that

change was similar -- made the exemption similar but

13

more tightly drawn than the APA's management exemption,

14

which at the time existed in another part of the

15

statute; it was a cross-reference.

16

When Congress then continued to revise the

17

statute, the House made very clear in the hearings, in

18

the House Report, and on the floor that its intent was

19

to cover these types of -- manuals and instructions to

then the Navy's recourse is to go to Congress as other

these documents.
