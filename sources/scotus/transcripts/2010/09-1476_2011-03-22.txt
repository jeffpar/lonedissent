Mr. Ortiz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL R. ORTIZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. ORTIZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In asking this Court to cabin Connick v.

12

Myers' public concern requirement, Respondent would

13

constitutionalize, under the Petition Clause, large

14

parts of the law of public employee discipline, and

15

thereby grant to public employees a broad constitutional

16

employment right that private employees do not enjoy.

17

Two independent reasons, however, argue strongly for

18

applying the public concern requirement to discipline

19

claims brought both under the Free Speech and the

20

Petition Clauses.

21

First, the constitutional framework

22

principles this Court has repeatedly identified in its

23

public employment cases argue strongly for requiring it.

24

And second, McDonald v. Smith's principle of parity

25

argues strongly for creating no hierarchy between the

Free Speech and Petition Clauses.

When -­

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You agree that the Petition

4

Clause is -- is different and does have a separate

5

content?
MR. ORTIZ:

6

Your Honor, we agree that the

7

Petition Clause -- that when the Petition Clause and the

8

Free Speech Clause cover the same activity, they

9

apply -- they cover it under McDonald in the same way.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

But the Speech Clause, in

11

the employment context, has been interpreted to cover

12

the content.

13

depends upon the content, right?
MR. ORTIZ:

14
15

One part of that inquiry turns

on the content.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

16
17

Whether it -- whether it applies or not

And you want the Petition

Clause also to turn on the content?

18

MR. ORTIZ:

Part of the inquiry, yes, Your

19

Honor, should turn on the content.

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, the -­

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Which wouldn't necessarily

3

break out the same way as whether it's a matter of

4

private concern versus a matter of public concern.
MR. ORTIZ:

5

Your Honor, this -- under the

6

constitutional background principles this Court has

7

developed, this Court should look at -- looks at how

8

close to the core a particular example of employee

9

activity is, and then talks about how much of a burden

10

that kind of activity poses to the efficient operation

11

of the workplace.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

12

But the core -- the core of

13

the Petition Clause is petitioning.

14

Free Speech Clause is political speech, of course -­

15

speech in public interest -- but the core of the

16

Petition Clause is quite different.

17

you're petitioning.

18

the -- most of the petitions in the early years were

19

regarding private matters; isn't that right?

It's simply whether

Surely you -- you could petition

There's not an empirical inquiry.

That depends

And as this Court

5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Petition Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, was -- was

2

aimed at promoting democratic self-government.
Petitioning is a particular form of speech.

3
4

It is speech directed to a particular audience, the

5

government, some arm of government, some individual in

6

government, and it is speech that has a particular

7

purpose:

8

policy.

Asking for a change of some sort in government

JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

That's true, and it seems

10

to me the -- the core is involved whenever you're asking

11

for a change.

12

distinction, if there is one, is whether you're asking

13

for a change in -- by your employer in your employment

14

conditions or a change by the government in some matters

15

over which the government has control as -- as

16

sovereign.

And it seems to me that the key

MR. ORTIZ:

17

Well, Your Honor, in practice,

18

that inquiry would not align much differently than the

19

Connick inquiry.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

20
21
22

It may well be, may well

be.
MR. ORTIZ:

And in this particular case,

23

designing a kind of threshold inquiry along those lines

24

would actually advantage Petitioners.

25

One difficulty in application, though, is
6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

that this Court has always identified the purpose of the

2

Connick threshold test as categoricalizing in a way the

3

Pickering balancing inquiry.

4

test that basically did not match, was a little oblique

5

to the Pickering balancing inquiry, it would create much

6

more work for the lower courts along the way.

7

perhaps this Court would want to change the Pickering

8

balancing inquiry.

9

JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

Would they have to do both?

11

MR. ORTIZ:

And if you had a threshold

Or

Would they have to do both?

They might well, Your Honor.

12

the Pickering balancing inquiry still aligns with the

13

traditional framework that this Court has described in

14

its employment cases, what I describe, and this other

15

inquiry, which you're suggesting, Justice Scalia, was

16

somewhat oblique to it, then it might conceivably be

17

necessary to do both.

If

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If you're proceeding with a

19

claim under two separate provisions of the Constitution,

20

it should not be surprising that you might have two

21

different tests.

22

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, Your Honor, then that

23

might argue for more reengineering of the rest of the -­

the enterprise as well, a step that this Court has not

identified as appropriate under -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why would it make -- why

2

would it make a difference at what you call the

3

balancing stage whether it is -- whether the distinction

4

is between public speech and private speech on the one

5

hand or government as employer and government as

6

sovereign on the other?

7

difference?

8
9

MR. ORTIZ:

Why would there be any

Well, Your Honor, if at the

first stage the Court is running an inquiry that is

10

something different from Connick, that is not going to

11

map onto traditional Pickering balancing, at least as

12

this Court has described it, at the second stage.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

MR. ORTIZ:

Why not?

Because, Your Honor, Pickering

15

balancing has gone to things like how -- how -- how

16

important that particular example of speech is, how

17

close it is to the core of what the First Amendment

18

protects, and then that is weighed against the kind of

19

burden it would place on the government to have that

20

activity protected in a very strong way.

21

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I think all you're saying

22

is that one of the elements of Pickering balancing is

23

the element of Petition Clause jurisprudence, as I

24

suggested it -- it might be applied; that is, in

25

Pickering balancing, certainly you have to ask, was what
8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the individual was asking for a change in employment

2

conditions?

3

it was a private matter, and then you go on to the rest

4

of the balancing.

That would be one of the questions.

If so,

But it seems to me you have to make that

5
6

determination under Pickering balancing anyway, and once

7

you make it, you've answered the -- the Petition Clause

8

question.
MR. ORTIZ:

Well, Your Honor, if this -- if

10

this Court were to proceed down that road, Petitioners,

11

I believe, would still end up victorious.

12

case, as I understand your -- your approach, where the

13

petition does concern purely employment matters.

14

not a petition aimed at or directed at the government in

15

its capacity as sovereign, so under that kind of

16

analysis, that is where the initial trigger, this case,

17

would have not been constitutionalized.

Would a claim of

particular claims involved, or statements in the

petition.

If it were a statement that there was a

policy, involved a petition against a policy in a

2

government department involving race, that would

3

certainly qualify.

supervisor had engaged in a form of discriminatory

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Doesn't that get to

is responsible until you litigate the issue.

So what is the -- addressing Justice

14

Scalia's question to you, what would qualify as a

petition to the employer as opposed to a petition to the

sovereign and why?

Your Honor, a petition to the

employer about changing the hours of employment -­

MR. ORTIZ:

I was asking the flip.

The flip.

A petition, a

23

complaint to an employer about the employer's pervasive

24

or apparently pervasive policies in violation of the

25

law, would certainly qualify as something to -- a
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

petition to the sovereign.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

2

Of course, you have to

3

wrestle with the same problem if you apply the other

4

test that you -- you were proposing.

5

MR. ORTIZ:

For sure.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Namely, whether it's a

7

private matter or a matter of public concern.

confront the same difficulty, don't you?

factors involved there:

context of the communication.

13

relevant.

14

sometimes messy, that there are some -- many cases where

15

the line of distinction is not clear.

its importance to the public employment environment.

was in this case.

not qualify under the access to courts definition or

conception of petition that Respondent has developed

JUSTICE SCALIA:

If -- if lawsuits are

18

covered by the Petition Clause, why is it that in the

19

innumerable cases this Court has had concerning what due

20

process of law consists of, we've never mentioned what

21

the Petition Clause requires.

22

Clause guarantees access to the courts, certainly there

23

are some minimum requirements that it imposes as well,

24

and I don't recall any of our cases dealing with

25

lawsuits that mention the Petition Clause.

I mean, if the Petition

12
Alderson Reporting Company

That's

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rather extraordinary if indeed it governs all lawsuits.
MR. ORTIZ:

2

Well, Your Honor, that might be

explained by the fact that the Due Process Clause has

4

been interpreted more robustly and supplies a certain

5

floor of constitutional protection for lawsuits.

the Petition Clause, since it is directed at petitions

generally and in particular the framers, the evidence

is, had in mind not petitions to the courts, but

petitions to the legislature, if lawsuits -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

10

And

Maybe that's all they had

11

in mind, or petitions to the executive as well.

12

what evidence do you have that it applied to lawsuits?
MR. ORTIZ:

13

What -­

The evidence is that developed

14

by Professor Andrews, and the argument is a somewhat

15

slender one that goes as follows:

16

founding, Congress was the central sort of clearinghouse

17

for petitions and handled both what we think of as the

18

stereotypical paradigmatic petitions, pleas to Congress

19

to sort of change the law, and also handled a lot of

20

private bills.

21

the responsibility for handling the things that came

22

through private bills to the courts, and so to the

23

extent -- this is Respondent's argument -- that the

24

courts handled, took over those things, the lawsuits are

25

protected.

At the time of

Over time, Congress handed over much of

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I agree with you that

that's slender.

3

MR. ORTIZ:

Thank you, Your Honor.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But you are not

5

challenging that, as I understand.

6

MR. ORTIZ:

No, Your Honor.

In the district

7

court it was conceded that the grievance activity would

8

be -- was protected.

9

quite sharply that under Respondent's new view of the

10

Petition Clause that the things of central importance

11

are lawsuits and other communications that would be

12

protected, perhaps be protected, otherwise under the

13

access to courts doctrine, that arbitration, the

14

arbitration involved in this case, does not count and

15

should not receive any kind of heightened protection.

16

The problem, much of the problem here, is the theory of

17

what is a petition from Respondent's side has changed

18

from the district court to this Court.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

However, Petitioners do contest

Mr. Ortiz, can I try a

20

hypothetical on you?

Suppose that there is a city

21

employee and unrelated to the fact that he is a city

22

employee the government takes some part of his property

23

without just compensation.

24

and the government says, somebody says, his employer,

25

that his supervisor said:

And he sues the government,

Do you know what he's just
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

done?

He's just sued the city; I think we should fire

2

him.

3

protected under the Petition Clause?

And he brings a retaliation claim.

MR. ORTIZ:

4

Is that

Yes, Your Honor, it would be

5

protected for two different reasons.

First, that would

6

-- similar activity would be protected under the Free

7

Speech Clause, so that would preserve the principle of

8

parity.
Second -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

10

Really?

What has he done

11

that's protected under the Free Speech Clause?

12

brought a suit saying:

13

compensation.

14

because this seems to me a purely private matter which

15

would not get protection under your test.

I'm entitled to just

It seems to me -- the reason I ask is

MR. ORTIZ:

16

He has

It's not employment-related or

17

related to his particular job, and this Court has always

18

drawn the distinction there.

19

Treasury Employees Union this Court applied that kind of

20

analysis.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

For example, in National

I see, so that goes back to

22

Justice Scala's difference test, which is it's not a

23

matter of public concern versus private concern, but

24

it's a matter of employment-related versus not

25

employment-related, correct?

Is that correct?

15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. ORTIZ:

Well, that shows how closely

2

those two things have been related in this Court's

3

approach.

4

privately-related, a public employee is complaining

5

about tax assessment or something like that and tries to

6

sue for retaliation under, under that theory, not for

7

anything related to his or her job, this Court -- under

8

this Court's and the lower court's application of the

9

Connick principles, there would be no problem there

10

In -- but certainly something that is

treating it as speech or as a petition.
So it is only when the lawsuit or the

11
12

petition involves something related to the person's

13

employment that these particular -- this particular test

14

would kick in.

15

this Court's twin background constitutional framework

16

principles, one that you look at how much disruption

17

something is likely to pose to the workforce and how

18

central it is to the particular constitutional provision

19

involved.

20

And that's consistent, Your Honor, with

In this case, if in general it's not

21

employment-related the government has much less interest

22

in worrying over it this way and applying the Connick

23

threshold test is much less justified.

24

to do Pickering balancing, proceed directly to Pickering

25

balancing in that case.

It would be very easy for a particular

10

clause, and just by rephrasing it, respinning it,

11

whatever, to turn it into a petition where under

12

Respondent's rule the result would be very different.

13

It also would require the Court to create a

14

hierarchy between speech claims and petition claims,

15

and, more importantly, if the Court were to go down the

16

particular road that Respondent describes and see the

17

center of the Petition Clause as defined by the access

18

to courts doctrine it would create a hierarchy among

19

different forms of petition.

20

that at the founding were thought to be at the

21

periphery, if there, of the Petition Clause would define

its center, and a paradigmatic petition of a letter to

would not be covered at all.

Thank you,

MR. PALMORE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Third Circuit rule here at issue is

flawed for two fundamental reasons.

12

this Court's admonitions, it quite literally

13

constitutionalizes the employee grievance process by

14

safeguards and by providing a potential First Amendment

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

First, contrary to

And

How much of your

20

argument is premised on the fact that there was an

21

alternative mechanism to the court system available.

22

MR. PALMORE:

That certainly -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning let's assume

24

there wasn't a collective bargaining agreement, let's

25

assume there wasn't a State law protection, all of the
18
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

items that you mention in your brief as existing to

2

resolve disputes, that the only avenue for redress were

3

the courts.

So where would that put your argument?
MR. PALMORE:

4

Well, it's a hard hypothetical

5

to answer, of course, because the grievance was filed

6

pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Putting it aside.

8

You -- you were talking about constitutionalizing a

9

grievance process.

10

how much of your argument depends on that fact?
MR. PALMORE:

11
12

I'm going more broadly and saying

Well, I think that's an

important part -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

What was the meaning

14

would -- it is harder if all they have access to is a

15

court proceeding.
MR. PALMORE:

16

I think that's an important

17

part of the argument, for this reason:

If you look at

18

the Third Circuit's case in San Filippo, the court had a

19

kind of a doctrinal basis for its ruling, but it also

20

had a practical concern that not affording protection

21

for this kind of petitioning activity would be a trap to

22

the unwary.

you still apply Connick, just as speech on matters of

10

private concern is protected by the First Amendment, yet

11

under Connick, an employee who engages in speech on a

12

matter of private concern is not going to be protected

13

in the employment context in all respects.

14

And that reflects a very important balance

15

that this Court has struck between its view of how the

Constitution applies to the government as sovereign

regulator of the general public and how it applies to

the government and its proprietary status as an

over speech activity, contrary to this Court's numerous

statements that there is no such hierarchy in the First

So going back to Thomas v. Collins in 1945,

In the United Mine Workers case, which is a

MR. PALMORE:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Palmore -- I'm sorry.
No, please.
Suppose a State legislature

bargaining rights, and a State employee files a lawsuit

MR. PALMORE:

Is that a

It -- it likely would be, and

20

I think this -- this goes to some of the questions

21

Justice Scalia was asking.

22

Connick that the question about -- of whether speech is

23

a matter of public concern is assessed not only by the

24

content, but by the form and the context.

25

But as this Court said in

So in the case that Your Honor is positing,
21
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

the content of the -- of the speech, which was that an

2

act of the legislature was illegal, would suggest that

3

it was a matter of public concern, the form, the form of

4

a lawsuit is relevant to the consideration, and the

5

context that it came in part of a larger political

6

debate would likely be relevant, too.

7
8
9

The problem with the Third Circuit approach
is that it never engages in that kind of inquiry.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And suppose -- now going

10

back to Justice Sotomayor's example, suppose that there

11

were a -- a class action alleging systemic

12

discrimination in some governmental workplace.

13

that be a matter of public concern?

14

MR. PALMORE:

It very well might be.

Would

That's

15

similar to this Court's decision in the GiVon case.

16

that was a case where a teacher went to complain to her

17

principal about the school's general policy of

18

discrimination, and this Court held that that was speech

19

on a matter of public concern, that it affected more

20

than just that individual employee's employment status.

21

So

So many of these hypotheticals and many

22

submissions and petitions to the government as sovereign

23

will, in fact, satisfy the public concern test, and then

24

you'll get into Pickering balancing.

25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do you -- can you think of

22
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

any instance where speech by the employee would not be

2

protected under the Pickering-Connick free speech

3

calculus but would be protected under the Petition

4

Clause?
MR. PALMORE:

5

I think that, no, if you put

6

it in that way; this Court has never separately analyzed

7

the two.

8

think the Connick test already takes into account the

9

distinction between what might be deemed petitioning

But I think it is important to note that I

conduct and non-petitioning conduct because of its use

11

of the term "form."

form.

15

something that -- that should be taken into account.

serious question about whether a letter submitted to an

23
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

petition.

But that's the kind of line-drawing that the

2

Third Circuit approach requires.
This Court has had a very broad conception

3
4

of what counts as petitioning activity, so in Edwards v.

5

South Carolina the Court said that a march to the

6

grounds of the State capitol in South Carolina to

7

protest segregation was an example of petitioning

8

conduct in its most classic and pristine form.
The Third Circuit doesn't -- doesn't

9
10

count -- wouldn't count that as a petition for this

11

purpose.

12

will count as a petition, basically a lawsuit and an

13

employee grievance.

14

It has kind of a gerrymandered view of what

Now, the -- the approach followed by the

15

majority of the circuits and the approach we advocate

16

today doesn't require that kind of line-drawing, because

17

whether, for example, the grievance filed in this case

18

is a petition or not, it's certainly speech, and so we

19

would agree that it's susceptible to analysis under the

20

normal Connick v. Myers framework.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Palmore, what about

22

the distinction that the other side brings up that

23

Connick is about what happens inside the workplace -­

24

you don't want to disrupt the routine by the kind of

25

activity in which Myers was involved -- but the Petition

Alderson Reporting Company

1

Clause, they're talking about conduct outside the

2

workplace, that is a complaint filed in court, nothing

3

that's happening in the workplace.

4

MR. PALMORE:

Well, I think it's workplace­

5

related and I think that's the test.

6

it -- you know, where an employee physically was when he

7

or she filed the petition isn't really relevant.

8

question is the connection to the workplace and the

9

connection to the employer-employee relationship.

So I don't think

The

10

So as Mr. Ortiz answered before, the NTEU

11

case provides a separate set of protections under the

12

First Amendment, under the speech protection for

13

employees who engage in speech conduct that has no

14

connection to the workplace, and it would limit the

15

ability of a government employer to take action against

16

such an employee.

17

But the conduct here is the -- the

18

grievances that were filed here were obviously

19

intimately connected to the workplace relationship

20

between Chief Guarnieri and the Borough Council.

21

was not a case like NTEU, where someone wanted to go out

22

and give a speech on something that had no connection to

23

their job or go out and file a lawsuit or some kind of

24

petitioning activity on something that had no connection

one last hypothetical.

council passed a resolution that said a precinct house

that this was micromanagement and it was going to affect

the public safety of the citizenry, and then that chief

of police was fired.
Is that a matter of public concern?

9

MR. PALMORE:

10

It very well might be.

It's

11

hard to answer in the abstract, because what this Court

12

has said is that the question has to be analyzed in

light of the whole record and in light of the context -­

content, the context, and the form.
It's not necessary for this Court in this

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
Neither the text, history, or purpose of the

11

employer in an efficient workplace provide a basis for

12

distinguishing and giving less protection to a petition

14

The text of the Petition Clause certainly

15

draws no such distinction.

17

by whether the matter is of concern to the petitioner.

that the ordinary, routine e-mails, give and take within

The, the -- that it, the

government's interest as an employer is part of the

calculus if -- if this issue arose under the Petition

8

Clause, and under ordinary balancing one would look at

9

the nature of the government's interest and the degree

10

of burden that's imposed, and that's the way the Court

11

has administered the Petition Clause.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

to apply that analytic, broad analytic framework to the

are not suggesting the government has to pay his filing

Well, Mr. Schnapper, can I

ask Justice Kennedy's question in maybe a little bit of

a different way?

18

In -- in the Connick inquiry, you have a

threshold inquiry and then you have a balancing test.

20

Now, you're suggesting that the threshold inquiry, the

21

public concern inquiry, is kind of apples and oranges

22

here; it's just not appropriate for the Petition Clause.

23

But the question that then follows is,

24

should there be a replacement threshold inquiry before

you get to the balancing that Connick suggests is the

that you're asking.

There would be a threshold inquiry

as to whether what had happened was petitioning.

5

were, this Court's decisions indicate that the Court

6

might impose a threshold inquiry consistent with, say,

the line of cases, most recently BE&K Construction, as

to whether the underlying petition had a -- a reasonable

basis or was -- had been pursued in good faith.

Alderson Reporting Company

That sounds much

more petition-like than filing a grievance pursuant to a

3

collective bargaining agreement.
So the -- the distinction between Connick,

who was taking a poll -- why wasn't that a petition?

6

Maybe -- did she just put the wrong label on it?

If she

Our

10

view, as I indicated to Justice Alito, is that a gripe

11

within the office, whether you label it a petition or

12

not, would not, except in maybe some extraordinary

13

circumstance, constitute a petition.
But if I might respond, I think your

14
15

question raises a second important linguistic point,

16

which is the word "petition" today has acquired a

17

somewhat different meaning than it would have probably

18

had in the 18th century.

things you see out on tables, along the street; people

say, come on, sign my petition to do this, that, or the

We think of petitions as the

could have large numbers of people signing something

called a petition was much controverted at that time.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

Well, you're the expert in

this area, but that -- that surprises me.

6

was quite common in the early 1800s for you to go to all

7

your neighbors -- and the book "Quarreling About

Slavery" explains this, where there were petitions

signed by many of the constituents in the congressman's

It is, but what I'm

phenomenon.

century or earlier.

20

I, I think that if that's done by private individuals

and directed to the government, it would be protected by

the Petition Clause.

23

You see very little of that in the 18th
And I'd note, although -- I mean,

history, that at the time that happened, its legitimacy

was challenged, and the argument was made by the

proponents of slavery in support of a gag order adopted

by Congress that this was not really a legitimate

I think it's

But it

illustrates how the position advanced by Petitioners

stands on its head the historical evolution of the

Petition Clause, which starts as about private matters,

it extended to things of broader concern and possibly a

24

Suppose it just prohibited discrimination and it didn't

25

have a retaliation clause.

Title VII has this provision, an explicit
But suppose it didn't.

It's the thrust of your

43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

arguments that the government employee would have a

2

claim for retaliation, although someone in the private

3

sector would not?

4

MR. SCHNAPPER:

Exactly.

Exactly.

And here

5

we part company with -- I think the government expressed

6

the concern in its brief and perhaps at oral argument --

7

I guess it was Petitioner that made this point -- that

8

there was something amiss about government employees

9

having rights that private employees don't.

That

10

distinction exists because the Bill of Rights and the -­

11

and the other constitutional guarantees, with the

12

exception of the Thirteenth Amendment and the right to

13

travel in interstate commerce, those rights don't apply

14

to private -- to people dealing with private employers.

15

That's just -­

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but that's

17

the basis of our law in this area is that when the

18

government is actually the employer the rights of the

19

individuals are somewhat different, and they're closer

20

to the rights that private employees have.

21

saying that these constitutional provisions apply

22

against the government and therefore, you don't have to

23

worry about the distinction between private employers

24

and government employers doesn't seem to be -- me to be

25

completely responsive to our precedent.
44
Alderson Reporting Company

So simply

MR. SCHNAPPER:

And -- and we're not taking

issue with the assertion of the government that the

government as an employer has interests which are

different than it -- it -- those it has just as a

5

sovereign.

6

the distinction they propose in this case between

7

matters of public concern and matters of only private

8

concern.

9

But that distinction has nothing to do with

Indeed, to the contrary.

To the extent that

10

the government's -- the government's interests might be

11

greater, surely a petition that deals with a matter of

12

public importance is going to cause the government a lot

13

more trouble than a purely private matter.

alleging systemic employment discrimination on the basis

Mr. Guarnieri had alleged and a court had found that he

real question in these cases whether the employee is

acting as a citizen or instead whether the employee is

And in the speech cases, that

45
Alderson Reporting Company

1

Maybe in the petition cases it suggests something else,

but that that's really the question we should be asking

3

is, is this employee acting as an employee or as a

citizen?
MR. SCHNAPPER:

5

With all due respect, our

view is it depends whether or not the -- the employee is

acting as a petitioner within the meaning of the

You do, I think,

MR. SCHNAPPER:

that that is a serious problem for three reasons.

First

13

of all, the Petitioners have in -- in highly expressive

language described the decision in Filippo as one which

would lead to an avalanche, tsunami, an overwhelming

number of new lawsuits.
We pointed out in our reply brief that they

had not adduced any evidence that any such thing had

happened in the 17 years since San Filippo.

support that.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Their reply

Well, but things

years in the wake of San Filippo is a little bit -- it's

I think the idea that it hasn't happened in 17

47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

not very compelling.
MR. SCHNAPPER:

2

Well, I think your -- I

3

think there are two -- two other reasons why this is not

4

a -- a major concern.

5

the case that you could take any beef, write "Federal

and be protected.

The first one is it simply isn't

Most internal gripes don't raise a

10

petition, particularly a lawsuit, that doesn't have a

reasonable basis simply isn't going to be protected.
It's also, to be frank, based on my contact

12
13

with private petitioners, it's highly unrealistic to

14

suggest that if an employee, government employee, took

15

some gripe and went to a lawyer and said, let's file

this in Federal court, I want to get it off my chest, to

17

find a lawyer on a contingent fee basis that is going to

18

do that.

you're not going to find a lawyer who will do it; and on

MR. ORTIZ:

Thank you, counsel.

Your Honor, it defies the

10

imagination that the radical Republicans and the framers

understood that the Petition Clause would

constitutionalize public employee grievance, and as

13

academic commentary that Respondent cites suggests,

14

their -- Respondents long-centered view of the Petition

Clause would call into question, sovereign immunity

doctrine, parts of Rule 11, suggest a right to appeal

17

and a right to judicial review whenever anyone has

agreed to government action.

19

There is also a danger that it would

constitutionalize the arbitration process whenever the

government is a party.

If I can just answer one question.
