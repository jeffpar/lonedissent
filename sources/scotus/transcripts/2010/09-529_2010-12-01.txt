ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH M. GALANTER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GALANTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

The Virginia Office for Protection and

12

Advocacy, known as "VOPA," seeks to enforce its Federal

13

statutory right to inspect and copy records that are in

14

the possession of State officials who run State-operated

15

hospitals.

16

Respondents acknowledged below that if

17

Petitioner were a private entity, Ex parte Young would

18

permit this suit.

19

not change the Ex parte Young analysis because it

20

imposed neither a greater burden on the treasury nor the

21

dignity of the State.

22

the Federal court is who has the correct reading of

23

Federal law about the records access issue.

VOPA's status as a State entity does

But it's independent here because its

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say on page 27

10

of your brief, the blue brief, that there's no big deal

11

here with respect to State sovereignty because

12

ultimately the sovereign retains the authority to

13

dissolve the State agency plaintiff if the State

14

believes the litigation is too onerous.

15

MR. GALANTER:

That -- that's correct.

That

16

is, the sovereign, the Commonwealth, could repeal the

17

law that enacted VOPA, just as in this Court's cases,

18

ICC v. United States, Congress could have removed -­

19

eliminated the ICC.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's a good -- a

21

good cite for your proposition, but arguably in those

22

cases, the ICC is really not the real party in interest.

23

The real party in interest is the beneficiary of the ICC

24

ruling.

25

MR. GALANTER:

Well, I believe this Court

2

Federal agencies can litigate, the cases involving the

To get -- to get

8

back to my question, you -- no court would entertain

9

Ford West against Ford East?

10

MR. GALANTER:

If -- if that's right, and I

11

think it is if they're part of the same -- if they're

12

subsidiaries of one corporation and aren't separate.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, why is that true?

14

If they're separate corporate entities, what legal rule

15

would stop a separate corporate entity from suing

16

another?

17

company, I think that's a different issue.

18

the same company, that's a different issue, and just a

19

different branch or a different office.

20

Is there a -- if they're part of the same

I -- I had understood that to

21

be the Chief Justice's hypothetical.

MR. GALANTER:

I do believe then that there

2

could be litigation between them, but ultimately there

3

wouldn't be.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I would have

5

thought that would become an advisory opinion.

6

an internal dispute, basically, and your -- in that

7

hypothetical, one of the entities would be asking the

8

Federal court to resolve it.

9

of the day how it wants to resolve it.

Ford has

Ford can decide at the end
If Ford West

10

wins and Ford East loses, Ford can say, all right, this

11

is how we're going to do it regardless of what the

12

Federal court says.

13

MR. GALANTER:

Well, that's true that after

14

the litigation is over, one of the parties may, you

15

know, be able to work around the law.

16

fact, in every Federal Spending Clause statute where

17

you're dealing with prospective relief.

18

always free to say, okay, if this is what we have to do,

19

we -- we opt out of the program.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's true, in

The State is

Well, the State here

21

is free to dissolve one of the -- one of the parties to

22

the case.

23

25

That's -- that's a little different.
MR. GALANTER:

Well, it's the Commonwealth

that's free to dissolve one of the parties to the case.

3

MR. GALANTER:

But I know.

I meant, as

opposed to the -- I wasn't making -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

MR. GALANTER:

Oh.

But the Respondents here are

6

State officials, and even the Respondents' agency has no

7

power over IPAS.

8

governor and the attorney general have no control over

9

what IPAS -- excuse me -- VOPA does.

10

And on the day-to-day basis, even the

IPAS is a similar

case out of Indiana.

11

But what's critical here is that, as we

12

stand here today, the Commonwealth has vested a Federal

13

right in VOPA, and neither the attorney general nor the

14

governor of Virginia can stop VOPA from exercising that

15

right.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, I'm -- I'm not

17

quite sure what the premise of your argument is.

You

18

seem to be arguing that the independence of the State

19

agency is what makes this particular entity capable of

20

suing.

21

test, which says if you're asserting a Federal claim,

22

you can sue and you're not -- and you're looking for

23

prospective injunctive relief, you can sue the State.

24

That general rule wouldn't look at who's suing.

25

was part of your argument.

Yet, in your brief, you rely on Verizon's simple

That

independence of the agency.

Which is your position?

2

MR. GALANTER:

I -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And if it is the one

4

about the State's independence, how do you articulate

5

why that becomes important or not?

6

significance of that vis-à-vis this case and any ones

7

moving forward?

8
9

MR. GALANTER:

What's the legal

If I may, I -- there are -­

there are three issues that are intertwined here.

First, the issue that I was talking about with the Chief

11

Justice regarding the Article III adversity that you

need for standing.

14

That's where the independence is

The second question is the one that we

15

petitioned on, which is the Eleventh Amendment issue,

16

and there we would suggest that the simple

17

straightforward inquiry of Verizon is relevant.

18

And then there's a third portion which the

19

court of appeals seemed to rely on, which is that -­

20

that the notion that the State has a Federal right at

21

all was -- against another part of the State and its

22

officials was incongruous.

23

a Tenth Amendment concern and is resolved here because

I don't know.
MR. GALANTER:

It -- it is not the case in

Virginia or in 49 of the 50 States.

14

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Okay.

Well, if it were and

15

if Congress offered money to the State and the only way

16

the State could get it would be to abandon its system of

17

separation of powers and to allow an agency of the State

18

which would normally be under the direction of the

19

governor to go riding off on its own and -- and sue the

20

governor, do you think there wouldn't be any -- any

only question -- this is all on an interlocutory appeal

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. GALANTER:

Got you.
-- is whether we can sue

15

other officials in the State to bring them into

16

prospective compliance with the Federal law.

17

as I said, though -- and this statute authorizes the

18

State, if it takes the money, to designate either a

19

public or a private entity as its protection and

20

advocacy system; that is, they could have vested these

21

Federal rights in a nonprofit corporation -­

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And as -­

Well, right, but

23

that makes all the difference in the world because they

24

made the choice of saying this is going to be one of us,

25

the State.

And as far as what issue is before the
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

12
1

Court, I would suppose the Article III question is a

2

jurisdictional one that we have to address before

3

reaching the Eleventh Amendment question.

4

MR. GALANTER:

I -- I think that they're

5

both sufficiently jurisdictional that you could reach

6

them in -- in -- you wouldn't have to reach Article III

7

before the Eleventh Amendment.

8

Article III question -- I mean, this Court in its FOIA

9

decisions such as, you know, Public Citizen v.

But I do think that the

10

Department of Justice, has said that Congress can create

11

a right to access to information -­

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Galanter, if we can

13

go back to get what this -- this entity was.

14

Federal legislation gives the States a choice.

15

do it either in a State agency or a private entity.

16

specification that the State agency has to be

17

independent is in the Federal statute, isn't it?

18

MR. GALANTER:

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, Your Honor.
It's not -- it's not up

20

to the State to want to put it into an independent

23

Federal program or was it a pre-existing agency?

24
25

And is it -- and this VOPA -- is

MR. GALANTER:

were created just to implement this program.
Alderson Reporting Company

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And does it do anything

else other than administer the Federal program?
MR. GALANTER:

It has a few responsibilities

4

that the State has given it under State law in addition,

5

but its primary function -- and at this point all its

6

budget comes from the Federal Government, and it serves

7

primarily this Federal function to go into public and

8

private institutions to observe and make sure that abuse

9

and neglect is not occurring there.

10

And that is, obviously, why these records

11

were requested, because the statute gives the protection

12

and advocacy service a right to access records of people

13

in the institutions to make sure that they are not being

14

mistreated and that the investigations and the

15

oversights by the State are taking place and are being

16

done correctly.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counsel, following up on

18

Justice Scalia's question to you, his question in fact

19

is in part what happened here.

20

did require every State agency to seek the permission of

21

its attorney general, is it, to sue?

22

said that's not independent enough, and if you want the

23

money, you've got to make VOPA eligible to sue without

24

that permission; is that correct?

25

MR. GALANTER:

Virginia at some point

And the government

On the Eleventh Amendment point, which is,
again -­

you're anxious to get to that, but -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

you know of any other situation where one party to a

11

Federal court action can dissolve the other one in the

middle of the case?

13

request with the State and they think it is, as you put

14

it in your brief, too onerous, the State can say:

15

what, the case is over, you're dissolved.

16

I mean, if VOPA files a discovery

MR. GALANTER:

Guess

Well, I -- again, I would go

17

back to the Federal analogy, that in all this litigation

18

with the ICC or -- well, with the Federal labor

19

relations authorities, with the licensing authority of

20

the Department of Interior for dams that -- that, you

21

know, the TVA might want to build, that Congress can

22

always eliminate these agencies, but while they are

23

still in existence -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I guess, in Nixon v. United

States, the President could have dismissed the attorney

general, but we allowed the suit to go forward.

2

did understand that.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. GALANTER:

I never

Well, I think -- I think it's

5

because you look at standing in terms of the current

6

reality, and in Nixon, for example, the attorney general

7

had promulgated a regulation saying he couldn't dismiss

8

the special prosecutor except for cause.

9

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

But there are a number of

10

instances in the States where constitutional officers

11

have their separate autonomy, their separate

12

responsibilities.

13

inevitably from your position that the attorney general

14

of State A could sue the governor of State A saying the

15

governor is being sued in an Ex parte Young capacity

16

because the governor is not following Federal law.

17

think that's just inevitable from your -- from you

18

position, and that seems to me a vast extension of Ex

19

parte Young.

20

that the identity of -- or the permissibility of an Ex

21

parte Young suit depends on the identity of the

22

plaintiff, but don't we have to say that here if we're

23

going to allow the States to structure their -- their

24

own governments as they choose?

25

And it seems to me to follow

I

It's true, I think, that we've never said

MR. GALANTER:

Well, I would say that --

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

16
1

well, I would say two things.

2

you have to accept, as I think Respondents do in this

3

case, that the Virginia Office of Protection and

4

Advocacy legitimately holds a Federal right.

5

I am hard pressed, and -- and Respondents and their

6

amici were hard pressed, to come up with any example

7

where an attorney general would hold a Federal right

8

against another part of the State.

9

here -­

10

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

First, the idea that -­

I can't --

And particularly

Well, he would tell the

11

governor that the governor is not giving adequate

12

protection to prison inmates or State employees, that

13

the -- that the governor's own personnel regulations are

14

incorrect, and he would sue under Ex parte Young.

15

MR. GALANTER:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

17

There are all kinds of

Federal rights.

18
19

If the Commonwealth -­

MR. GALANTER:

Federal rights that State officials have against other

17
1

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, but that's -- but

2

under -- under your theory there would be, because under

3

Ex parte Young, the whole point of it is that a -- a

4

person can allege that this fictional private individual

5

who's really a governmental individual is violating a

6

Federal right.

7

That's the whole point of it.

MR. GALANTER:

Violating the plaintiff's

making is that sometimes one Federal agency needs

permission from another Federal agency to build

something, and there would be a litigable controversy

under Article III, and that's the only point I was

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think -- do you think

the Spending Clause allows the Federal Government to

10

condition the receipt of Federal funds on a State's

11

agreement to change the structure of State government?

12

MS. ANDERS:

I think it does, so long as -­

13

as that requirement is reasonably related to the

14

government's interest in the funds and in -- in the

15

objective of its regulation.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Now, there's -­
Suppose the government said

17

if you want Medicaid funds, the State agency that

18

administers the Medicaid program must be headed by a

19

person who has a 20-year term of office and is removable

20

only for gross dereliction of duty.

21

do that?

22

Congress do it?

23

Would -- can they

Can the Federal Government do that?

MS. ANDERS:

Can

I think it could do that, so

long as that's not independently unconstitutional.

25

think the State always has the opportunity to decide not

1

to opt into the scheme, and I think that's very

2

important here because the sole aspect of this suit that

3

Virginia challenges, which is the fact that VOPA is a

4

State agency, is the result of two sovereign choices

5

that the State made here.

6

The first choice was to opt into the DD and

7

PAIMI Act programs, to take the Federal funds, to create

8

a P and A system that has Federal rights of access to

9

which both State and private facilities are subject.

10

And the second choice that Virginia made was to

11

establish a State agency P and A system here.

12

have established a private agency if it were concerned

13

about -­

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It could

Ms. Anders, I understand

15

that most States that -- that are taking advantage of

16

this program do it through a private entity, not a

17

State; is that -- is that right?

18
19

MS. ANDERS:

There are

eight public P and A systems.

20
21

That's correct.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Can EPA sue the Army

Corps of Engineers for violating the Clean Water Act?

22

MS. ANDERS:

Well, I think you would have an

23

Article III problem if there isn't sufficient adversity.

24

If the -­

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
Alderson Reporting Company

Oh, very adverse.

21
1

EPA wants clean water, and the Army Corps of Engineers

2

wants to, you know, dredge the water in a way that

3

contributes to pollution.

4

MS. ANDERS:

Well, they're both -- the heads

5

of both agencies are, in that situation, I think,

6

subject to removal by the same people, and so in that

7

situation, you would have an Article III problem.

8

we don't have that problem here, because VOPA is

9

independent under State law, and -­

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But

Do you agree with

11

the Petitioners that Virginia can dissolve VOPA if it

12

finds the litigation too onerous?

13

MS. ANDERS:

I think that that would not

14

happen in practice, because if Virginia were to dissolve

15

VOPA, it would be out of compliance with the Federal

16

scheme, and so it would lose its -- it would lose its

17

Federal funding at that point.

18

that's a situation that's going to arise, but -­

19

And so I don't think

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If -- if it happened

20

to arise, do you think that they can -- do you agree

21

with the Petitioners that they can do it?

22

MS. ANDERS:

I think they -- I think they

23

could do it, but I think this -- this Court has

24

previously adjudicated cases where, in theory, the

25

government could have changed the case midstream.

U.S. v. Nixon is an example of that; the ICC case as

They weren't subject to

So I think, while you might have an Article

8

III problem in some situations, you don't have that

9

problem here because of VOPA's independence.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you be a little

11

bit more specific for me on what you mean about an

12

Article III problem?

13

about State attorney generals willy-nilly suing -- or

14

not willy-nilly -- suing governors to comply with

15

Federal law.

16
17
18

Justice Kennedy was concerned

Why do you think it won't happen, and what
are the legal impediments to that occurring?
MS. ANDERS:

I think there are several.

I

19

think, first, you would have to have a Federal right

20

that the AG would be able to enforce.

He would have to

21

have a way to get into Federal court.

He would have to

22

have a theory of standing, and I think this is not a

23

situation that has arisen at this point.

24

examples of this.

25

There are no

And so I think -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought -- this I'm

confused about.

I would think you would have to have a

2

State which has a law that permits the attorney general

3

to sue the governor.

Wouldn't you?

4

MS. ANDERS:

If the -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, if the State law is

6

the attorney general can't sue the governor, that's the

7

end of it, isn't it?

8
9

Or is it -­

MS. ANDERS:

If that were sufficient to get

into Federal court for Article III purposes.

I think

10

there might be some situations in which the attorney

11

general -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

Suppose the State law

13

is the governor of the State cannot bring a lawsuit

14

against the attorney general, and vice versa.

15

That's the State law.

16

can either bring a lawsuit on a Federal right in Federal

17

court?

18

Okay?

Now, under those circumstances,

MS. ANDERS:

There may be some circumstances

19

like that one, in which the State AG's use of Ex parte

20

Young would raise special sovereignty interests that

21

would counsel against -­

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but I want just a yes

or no answer.

In your opinion, can an attorney general,

24

where the State law says, black letter law, attorney

25

general can never sue the governor; he's fired instantly

can that individual come into Federal court and sue on

I think that if -- there might be certain

that is a problem, and is that -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Yes, I -­

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That can't be.

How can

14

that be?

He has no power as attorney general to do

that.

16

It has to do with his power as attorney general.

It has nothing to do with -- with Ex parte Young.

MS. ANDERS:

You can't.

Federal Government cannot tell a State how to organize

If it wants to have an attorney general that

can never bring a lawsuit, that's up to the State,

3

unless it's a due process problem.

4
5

Now, suppose I believe that.

Now, do you

lose this case?

6

MS. ANDERS:

No, I don't think so, because

7

the same special sovereignty interests are not present

8

here, because under the Spending Clause, Virginia had

9

the choice to opt into this scheme.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Doesn't -- doesn't the

11

Federal statute say, Virginia, if you want to do this

12

through a State agency, that State agency has to be an

13

independent agency and have the authority to sue?

MS. ANDERS:

That's correct, and -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

remove the members of this Virginia agency?

20

MS. ANDERS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MS. ANDERS:

Where is that?

Well, the provision -- well,

12

the requirement that VOPA have full authority to pursue

13

legal remedies to ensure the protection of individuals.

14

This is on page 52a of the petition appendix.

the PAIMI law.

What if the VOPA

officials are engaged in corruption or illegal conduct

20

discredit upon the -- the governor has no power to say

21

that, you're a Virginia official and you're -- you know,

22

whatever -- breaking Virginia law, for example?

23

MS. ANDERS:

And -­

Well, under Virginia law, I

24

think that VOPA's officials are subject to for-cause

25

removal provisions.

So they can actually be removed

2

perspective, that's consistent with VOPA's independence

type of for-cause removal wouldn't be on the basis of

VOPA's actions in litigation.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. GETCHELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

The dignity interest of a sovereign is

6

impaired if it is pitted against itself in the courts of

7

another sovereign without its consent.

8

take -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And I would

should not agree to the deal.

11

12

MR. GETCHELL:

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, let's -­
I mean, you know, the

14

Commonwealth had the choice.

15

as counsel for the Government said.

16

turn down the money or, if it's not dignified enough to

17

do that, it could take the money and establish a private

18

organization to do this work instead of a State agency.

19

So, what -- you know, what complaint do you have here?

20

MR. GETCHELL:

It had two choices, as -­
It could either

Well, let me -- let me first

21

say that the choice issue raises some interesting

22

questions because of the procedural posture of this case

23

being an interlocutory appeal.

24

issue of waiver and abrogation, that was litigated

25

below, and no waiver was found, and that wasn't appealed

Because remember, on the

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

30

against.

2

under a spending statute that the State has taken the

3

money in analyzing the sovereign interest, then we are

4

creating a waiver on the cheap and disheveling the

5

established doctrine.

6

So if we're going to say it makes a difference

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's not a waiver; it's

7

-- the Federal statute is clear.

8

can do this in one of two ways.

9

government agency, then that agency has to have

10

It says:

State, you

If you go with a

independence and it has to be able to sue.

11

So if the State is given a choice, it has -­

12

it can do it through private entity; it can do it

13

through, as in this case, an agency that was set up for

14

this very purpose and no other, right?

15

MR. GETCHELL:

I would have thought two

16

things about that.

17

the choice of making it a State agency, it understood

18

that any issues that arise from that would come with the

19

territory.

20

to is it waived its sovereign immunity to be sued, but

21

it did not specify suit in Federal court, and under

22

ordinary doctrine, that's a consent to be sued in its

23

own courts, not in Federal court.

24
25

One is when Congress gave the State

The second thing is what the State consented

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you have a State

which loves litigation.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

31
1

(Laughter.)

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Forty-eight percent of the

population are retired lawyers.

4

(Laughter.)

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

Nothing pleases them more

6

than to have everybody suing everybody else.

So they

7

pass a statute which says, for purposes of lawsuits in

8

this State, every department can sue every other

9

department.

10

Now, if you have such a State, what in the

11

Constitution stops the Federal Government from abiding

12

by that rule and applying ordinary Ex parte Young rules,

13

looking at the defendant, looking at horizon, and then,

14

if the plaintiff happens to be a Federal agency suing

15

another, say, well, if it complies with those first set,

16

the fact that A sues B and they're both State agencies,

17

that's the State's decision.

18

can prevent the State from deciding to organize what

19

we'll call the legal heaven way?

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. GETCHELL:

What in the Constitution

I would say two things about

22

that.

23

Congress -- Congress said they had to have a right to

24

sue, and they didn't specify it was Federal court.

25

The first is that that's not what Congress did.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

Alderson Reporting Company

That's A.

We can go

Official - Subject to Final Review

32
1

into A later because I agree that would be an answer, if

2

it's correct -- I mean, if that is what happened.

3

That's a different question, whether Congress could

4

restructure the State.

5

my question was on the first.

6

State from restructuring itself?

7

That's a serious question.

MR. GETCHELL:

But

Can Congress stop the

Well, I -- I don't think the

8

State by restructuring itself would then ordinarily

9

expect its agencies to sue each other in Federal court.

10

In -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

If they wrote it down

12

specifically in the law and said we'd love to have our

13

agencies sue each other.

14

They just say we love to have our agencies sue each

15

other.

16

They don't say Federal court.

They don't mention the court.
MR. GETCHELL:

I would think that, under

17

ordinary rules of waiver of sovereign immunity, that

18

would limit the suits to the suits of the sovereign, the

19

State.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

about allowing the State -­

22

MR. GETCHELL:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

Why?

What's undignified

I just -­
-- to live with the choice

it made?
MR. GETCHELL:

I think the existing doctrine

2

consent to the Federal court.

there are concepts being confused.

that it hasn't waived sovereign immunity.

7

State; it's a suit against a State official.

8

entire premise of Ex parte Young is that this doesn't

offend sovereign immunity for a party to seek

11

There's no question
VOPA doesn't

And this is not a direct suit against the
And the

enforcement, prospectively, of a Federal right.
So I don't know why it really matters who

12

the plaintiff is so long as the sovereign interests that

13

we've recognized, that the issue of sovereignty is one

14

that respects a State's coffers and State's laws and

15

we're not going to interfere with any of them, but we

16

are going to ensure that, because of the pre-emptive

17

effect of the Constitution and our laws, that Federal

18

laws are respected.

19

intrusion on State sovereignty when the State knew and

20

consented consciously to letting VOPA sue for records

21

when it needed to?

22

So what's in this case the

MR. GETCHELL:

In referring to sovereign

23

immunity, I was trying to answer the hypothetical with

24

respect to why Ex parte Young doesn't apply.

25

part of the question was Congress could expect Ex parte

In the hypothetical, Congress was

JUSTICE BREYER:

No.

The hypothetical was

just -- Justice Sotomayor is totally right.

I'm talking

about Ex parte Young.

11

MR. GETCHELL:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.
I'm imagining -- I'm

13

imagining a system where the State wants to let the AG,

14

this organization, the sheriff of Middlesex County, the

15

City of San Francisco -- they want to permit such

16

entities to become plaintiffs against other parts of the

17

State government in such a State if ordinary Ex parte

18

Young requirements are met.

19

the United States prohibits that suit from going ahead?

20

MR. GETCHELL:

What in the Constitution of

Because Ex parte Young is an

21

exception to the default position.

The default position

22

is that the States at the founding retained all of their

23

natural law-of-nations sovereign immunity.

24

it was -- that it was limited.

25

State; the Federal Government can sue another State; and

We know that

A State can sue another

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

35
1

-- can sue a State; and there is the Ex parte Young

2

exception, but it is the exception.

3

It is being extended here.

We know it's

4

being extended here because it's never been done before.

5

And if you're going to extend it, then we ought to ask

6

the question of whether or not -- asking the Hans

7

question.

8

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why -- why is it an

9

extension?

I mean, I have sort of a bit of a problem

10

with that.

Why is it somehow a -- a greater

11

infringement upon State sovereignty to allow a State to

12

be sued in Federal court by a private individual, who

13

doesn't even have to be a Virginian, for Pete's sake -­

14

he could be from anywhere, he could be from Iowa.

15

yet, it somehow offends State sovereignty more when -­

16

when you allow a State agency to sue a State?

17

And

I don't -- I don't see why that's so

18

horribly worse, unless you're arguing that -- that it

19

somehow destroys the State system of separation of

20

powers.

21

answer to that is simply you did it yourself.

22

But that's a different question, and -- and the

MR. GETCHELL:

Well, what I -- what I would

23

say is that Ex parte Young is intended to deal with the

24

situation where a citizen of a dual sovereign is able to

25

vindicate his superior Federal rights against the State.
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

36
1

That interest is not served one bit by having a State

2

agency sue another State agency in Federal court, even

3

though that State agency could have sued in State court.

4

And I would ask the Hans question.

The Hans

5

question is, would the -- you know, the Constitution is

6

presumed not to raise up causes of action against the

7

States that would have been considered as anomalous and

8

unheard-of at the time of the founding.

9

you posited whether or not at the founding, if you had

And I think if

10

asked, can a part of a State -- well, can the Federal

11

Congress authorize part of a State to sue the other part

12

of the State in Federal court, I think it would have

13

been regarded as anomalous generally.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

When Virginia agreed to

15

participate in this program, did Virginia understand

16

that it could be sued by VOPA not only in -- in the

17

State courts but also in Federal court?

18

MR. GETCHELL:

I would assert not.

Virginia is unusual in having as much control in the

is a mechanism by which, if you had the governor in one

where there was a rogue attorney general is somebody

would win; the governor would win by getting a

legislative act that says it can't be done, or the

attorney general will win because the political

that, that there would be a lot of political motivation

It isn't that Ex parte

Young, if I understand this right, which is why I

part of a State to sue another part; it is a State

14

permits one part of a State to sue another part, that

15

that's common in the State, that the law requires it.

Am I right about the

whether or not the State has given independent authority

to sue without specifying that it can be in Federal

not the issue in the case.

I think the issue in the

not Ex parte Young should be extended to do something

JUSTICE BREYER:

In your experience -- this

would be helpful -- would you characterize as common or

court.

12

don't think that, as a principle of Federal jurisdiction

13

-- because, ultimately, whether sovereign immunity

exists, if it's not waived, does deprive this Court -­

or deprives a Federal court of the right to proceed.

16

I think that deciding we're going to extend

17

the fiction of Ex parte Young beyond the rights of

citizens to allow the State to sue itself in Federal

at all by a suit against -- against it in its own courts

17

that it has authorized.

understood that if you bring a State against its will

20

of Ex parte -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we use -- we don't

22

bring the State in; we bring a State official who is

violating a Federal law.

25

MR. GETCHELL:

But this Court has always

recognized that there is a large sense in which that's a
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

46

fiction and it's just something that we have to tolerate

2

in order to have a dual system of -- of sovereignty.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So your argument is really

4

-- really is a sovereign immunity argument.

5

saying that the waiver of sovereign immunity, unless it

6

explicitly includes a waiver to be sued in Federal

7

courts, applies only in State courts -- okay -- and that

8

that limitation should not be evaded by applying Ex

9

10

by another State agency.

11

MR. GETCHELL:

That is precisely my view.
So sovereign immunity is

part of your argument, but -­
MR. GETCHELL:

It -- well, it's -- I think

it's all that's really appropriately before this Court,

because, again, we're up here on an interlocutory appeal

this is good because that's very helpful to me -- the

exact statement that Justice Scalia made, and you said

5

MR. GETCHELL:

And the reason that

One, the State is being

6

pitted against itself.

7

in this case, VOPA sued the State officials in the name

8

of the Commonwealth.

9

If you look at the very caption

Secondly, there's a -- to the extent there's

10

any authority, we have Ex parte Young here that gives

11

rights to citizens, and we have a lot of cases that

12

resulted most recently in Ysursa, in which it was

13

recognized that the general rule is that subordinate

14

parts of States, subordinate State authorities, have no

15

constitutional privileges and immunities that they can

16

assert against their creator.

17

And if you wanted to know whether or not Ex

18

parte Young should be extended into this area, it seems

19

to me that the previous expectation would have been that

20

the Ysursa tradition would have said, no, we don't want

to extend this into this area.

MR. GALANTER:

I -- I don't think that's

correct.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. GALANTER:

Yes.
I think that most of the

8

time, when a State is involved in a dispute with another

9

State, it's about State law.

12

15

named the State in its own name.

18

suggesting is that -- that they -- it was the natural

19

suits against State officials.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you, counsel.

7

I have one question of curiosity.

opening argument that 49 of 50 States limit in some way

the executive's power in this area.

MR. GALANTER:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You said in your

What's the one

State?
MR. GALANTER:

I'm drawing that from the -­

14

Indiana's amicus brief, and I believe they identified

15

New Jersey as the State that has a unitary executive.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

The case is submitted.
