ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID E. MILLS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

We'll hear argument

MR. MILLS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Denial of summary judgment is not reviewable

11

on appeal after trial, especially where the decision

12

depends on whether the evidence on the merits of the

13

claim is sufficient to cross the legal line for

14

liability.

15

In this case -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm sorry to

16

interrupt so quickly, but that especially, I take it -­

17

I take it, is a concession that there's a difference

18

between claims for qualified immunity based on evidence

19

and claims that are based on law.

20

MR. MILLS:

Well, there's a difference

21

between defenses that depend on the evidence at trial.

22

What I would say about qualified immunity is that, to

23

the extent any court of appeals is going to enter

24

judgment based on qualified immunity, it needs to

25

understand the conduct of the officials in the case.

And so you're always talking about the evidence of that

conduct.

MR. MILLS:

law, Your Honor.

11

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And doesn't that fall

12

within the "except" clause that the Chief Justice was

13

talking to you about, which you haven't had much time to

14

fill out, I understand.

15

But -- well, if you're going to say -- and

16

it's really not whether the summary judgment is -- is

17

appealed.

18

the issues resolved by the summary judgment motion are

19

appealable.

20

your response, what the Chief Justice did, that maybe

21

sometimes the summary judgment motion, say, on an issue

22

of law is sufficient to preserve the issue.

23

That's a little bit -- it's whether or not

I read into your response, or implied from

MR. MILLS:

Well -- and that gets to what I

24

think is the heart of the split in the circuits and the

25

confusion, is that every circuit recognizes a very
4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

general rule that where the evidence at trial moots that

2

at summary judgment, we're not going to review the

3

summary judgment decision.

4

Now, a number of courts said:

Well, wait a

5

second; there are summary judgment issues that don't

6

depend on the evidence, and we're -- those are typically

7

called questions of law.

8

number of good examples in their brief of defenses such

9

as statute of limitations, pre-emption, and the like,

And Respondents point to a

10

that indeed very often don't depend at all on the

11

evidence at trial.

12

immunity is that qualified immunity requires the court

13

to look at the evidence of the claim itself.

14

The difference with qualified

Now, statute of limitations, for example, is

15

actually quite different, because in statute of

16

limitations -- let's suppose Michelle Ortiz filed her

17

suit 20 years late.

18

evidence she adduced of the Respondents' misconduct.

19

would be barred by statute of limitations.

20

It would not matter at all how much

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It

So Mr. Mills, what then

21

is the difference?

You point out, quite rightly,

22

summary judgment looks to what evidence there was, and

23

the question for the court is:

24

prove?

25

has the plaintiff proved?

What could the plaintiff

7

Because if there -- if there was

MR. MILLS:

It would be the

Well, I think that's largely -­

8

largely right, Justice Ginsburg, and here's an example

9

of what did change in this case.

10

At the summary judgment stage, what we had

11

were affidavits of the Respondents discussing their role

12

in relation to this case, with no comment whatsoever

13

about what the consequences would have been had

14

Ms. Jordan immediately reported the first sexual

15

assault.

16

Respondents' perspective on that -- on that point.

17

The record was bare at summary judgment from

At trial, under cross-examination,

18

Ms. Bright testified that Respondent Jordan indeed

19

violated prison policy by not reporting it and then,

20

very crucially, also agreed that the second, more

21

violent assault would have actually been precluded had

22

that report taken place.

23

Now, that's -­

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

troubles me about this case.

Well, this gets to what
Although the Sixth Circuit

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

referred to summary judgment in its opinion, it seems to

2

me the Sixth Circuit actually reviewed the evidence at

3

trial and determined that the defendants were entitled

4

to judgment as a matter of law based on the evidence at

5

trial.

6

So I don't know why this case actually

7

presents the question on which cert was granted.

It

8

seems to me it presents a question of -- a purely

9

factual question in the end, whether there was -­

10

whether judgment as a matter of law was appropriate.

11

And you never raised the judgment as a matter of law.

12

You never raised in the court of appeals, as

13

I understand it, the argument that the defendants'

14

ability to object to the entry of judgment as a matter

15

of law was waived because they never filed a Rule 50(b)

16

motion.

17
18

Isn't that right?
MR. MILLS:

Well -- well, there's a couple

points in there that I need to address.

19

First, I think that you are exactly right.

20

What the Sixth Circuit did here is it -- it reviewed a

21

summary judgment decision, but it did peek ahead to the

22

trial evidence, and it said it was doing that.

23

that highlights the fundamental problem of reviewing

24

summary judgment after the trial.

25

implicitly recognizing it would be illogical to look at

5

of summary judgment.

a Rule 50(b) motion, that was waived because it wasn't

12

So we are -- we come back to exactly where

13

we are now.

14

the -- what was arguably a slip of the pen, perhaps

15

motivated by their belief that the Rule 50(b) issue is

16

jurisdictional.

17

distinguishing between jurisdictional questions and

18

claims processing questions.

19

All we've done is to correct a slip of

point.

23

whatsoever and it was, as Respondents say, essentially a

24

Rule 50(a) review, that conflicts with an entire line of

this Court's decisions leading into Unitherm, which

That's right, and I think -- I

think it highlights that this really was a summary

judgment review by the Sixth Circuit of -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now, Mr. Mills, if I could

16

just understand your answer to Justice Alito.

17

concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the

18

record built on the whole trial and that that's a

19

different record from the record that existed at summary

20

judgment; is that correct?

21

MR. MILLS:

You

I do concede it, except to the

22

extent that I concede they did an adequate review of the

record.

13

this point where Ms. Bright conceded on cross that Ms.

14

Ortiz indeed would have been separated and the assault,

15

second assault, precluded, it's one of two things:

16

Either the Sixth Circuit's reviewing summary judgment

looking ahead at these trial facts and because -­

Since you didn't object below to a

the word "power" is not an accidental use.

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why is it -- I mean,

12

power -- jurisdiction is power, power to proceed in a

13

case.

14

cases of this Court that distinguish the Rule 50(a),

15

50(b) from the run-of-the-mine claim processing rule

16

because in the background is the Seventh Amendment

17

Re-examination Clause.

18

there is this 50(a)-50(b) litany, why the verdict loser

19

must repeat the 50(a) motion, after -- after the

20

verdict.

But we are in an area where there are many, many

21

That's the whole reason why

So I'm surprised that you're using the word

22

"power." You're not referring to any of that history

23

which stems from a constitutional provision, the Seventh

24

Amendment.

25

MR. MILLS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, you're
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

absolutely correct, and I think that footnote 4 of

2

Unitherm goes right to your point.

3

Unitherm, the Court explains that the very reason a

4

court of appeals lacks the power, lacks the power to

5

review that question, is because it is essentially, as

6

in Unitherm, going to be as a court of appeals reviewing

7

the conduct -- the sufficiency of the evidence, without

8

a district court ruling on the question.

9

said in Unitherm that that raises serious Seventh

10

Amendment concerns.

This case is actually a very good

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, Mr. Mills, I got you

13

started on this, but this -- none of this is the

14

question on which we granted review, is it?

15

MR. MILLS:

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well -­
We didn't grant review to

17

decide whether a court of appeals can consider judgment

18

of a -- judgment as a matter of law where there isn't a

19

50(b) motion and no argument is made that the -- that

20

issue was waived by failing to make the motion.

21

didn't grant review on that.

22

MR. MILLS:

We

And, Justice Alito, that

23

highlights another important point about this exchange,

24

and that is that Respondents in the Sixth Circuit did

25

not suggest that the Sixth Circuit did have the
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

authority to take the summary judgment question and then

2

look ahead to trial facts.

3

has taken the summary judgment decision and then acted

4

without authority to look ahead at the trial facts.

5

so if the argument is that we have forfeited a

6

pre-emptive argument to the Sixth Circuit that it

7

couldn't do this frankly very unorthodox approach, I

8

don't think that that's a proper invocation of

9

forfeiture even regardless of the point about power.

10

And so, the Sixth Circuit

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And

What -- are you saying

11

then that if we explain to the Fifth Circuit -- to the

12

Sixth Circuit, that the record they must look at is the

13

trial record, so it's different from the summary

14

judgment stage, if we told them that, then maybe they

15

would look at the evidence differently, even though they

16

purported to look at the trial evidence?

17

MR. MILLS:

Well, I think if that order were

18

given, they would indeed do that.

19

come back to the point that there is absolutely no basis

20

on which they would have the authority to do that.

21

the point is, in the Unitherm line of cases, that if you

22

don't have a district court ruling on the very question,

23

the question here of whether their conduct, as they say,

24

crossed a constitutional line, you're circumventing the

25

district court's role in the entire process.

As this Court has explained repeatedly, a

2

requisite of a court of appeals reviewing that evidence

saw Respondent Bright on cross-examination, first have

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, if you're right, then

there has to be a remand to the Sixth Circuit with

10

instructions to send the case back to the district court

11

to ask the district court what -- whether it thought the

12

evidence was sufficient?

13

MR. MILLS:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

14

think that the best way to see this case is it's indeed

15

a review of the summary judgment decision.

16

exception to say:

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

And your argument is that

3

where a --the district court denies summary judgment on

4

a qualified immunity issue that is based even purely on

5

an issue of law, there can't be a review unless that's

6

renewed -- there can't be appellate review unless that

7

purely legal question is renewed in a Rule 50(b) motion.

8

That's your -- that's your argument?

9

MR. MILLS:

That is my argument, with a

10

couple key pieces -- first of all, they could, of

11

course, take a collateral order appeal, but if they

12

proceed to trial -- and here's -- here's sort of the

fundamental point about qualified immunity.

are purely legal questions in the qualified immunity

MR. MILLS:

Not that they would have put her

separate her from the officer, whether that meant

removing the officer from the location or putting her in

basic principle that the real evidence of a case is the

evidence at the trial, and what that means is that, if

the evidence at trial goes to the question at summary

illogical to ignore exactly what happened at trial and

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BENJAMIN C. MIZER

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

25

MR. MIZER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
25

Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1
2

please the Court:
As I think the discussion has already

3

demonstrated, Ms. Ortiz's question presented hinges on a

4

false assumption.

5

Circuit was reviewing the summary judgment order as the

6

final appealable order in this case.

7

That assumption is that the Sixth

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Except that it begins,

8

2(a), "Although courts normally do not review the denial

9

of a summary judgment motion after trial on the merits,

10

the denial of summary judgment based on qualified

11

immunity is an exception to this rule."

12

MR. MIZER:

13

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

14

And that's -­

And -­
That's the opening.

That

sets the stage for what follows.

15

MR. MIZER:

16

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

And -­
Now, it may be that

17

everybody, including the Sixth Circuit, misapprehended

18

the rule because there are some cases that depend on an

19

assessment of the record and some cases that don't, but

20

that's not what the Sixth Circuit said.

21

MR. MIZER:

I think that the Sixth Circuit's

22

word choice in the sentence that you just read was not

23

perfectly clear, but -­

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Mizer, you asked

for an appeal of the summary judgment motion, so they
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

might have chosen their words based on your request.

2

MR. MIZER:

Actually, Your Honor, the

3

summary judgment motion was only one of several orders

4

listed in the notice of appeal.

5

brief was very clearly couched as an appeal from the

6

verdict, which at the bottom of the prior page of the -­

7

of the petition appendix, from where Justice Kennedy

8

just read, the bottom of page 7a, the Sixth Circuit

9

calls it an "appeal from the jury verdict."

10

And the Sixth Circuit

And then the Sixth Circuit, at petition

11

appendix 2a and throughout its opinion, refers to "trial

12

evidence."

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, Mr. Mizer, then you

14

must concede that this opening sentence that

15

Justice Kennedy just quoted is wrong.

16

don't review the denial of summary judgment motion after

17

trial on the merits, but when the summary judgment

18

denial is based on qualified immunity, there's an

19

exception.

20

MR. MIZER:

Courts normally

I think that what the Sixth

21

Circuit meant there was that the issue of qualified

22

immunity raised at summary judgment was preserved.

23

don't think its word choice was perfectly clear, but I

24

think other -- other phrases in the Sixth Circuit's

25

opinion make clearer that what it was doing was viewing

Look at

such that there must have been qualified immunity under

Because what you're saying is that the

But going forward, it just

30
Alderson Reporting Company

buy into.

2

MR. MIZER:

Well, first of all, I think

3

that, because it is a difficult question, it should have

4

been raised by Ms. Ortiz properly, and she hasn't raised

5

the 50(b) argument properly.

6

to reach it, I think the clearer rule is to map the

7

Johnson line onto the sufficiency of the evidence line,

8

otherwise -- for 50(b) motions.

9

But even if the Court were

Otherwise, then -­

The Johnson line isn't much

of a map, is what the Chief Justice is suggesting.

11

a mess.

12

-- why should we double the difficulty by -- by bringing

13

it in at the -- at the Rule 50 stage as well?

14

It's very hard to sort those things out.

MR. MIZER:

You did move under 50(a).

That was the motion that you made, recognizing

species of argument than the argument on which -- than

11

resolved the case, which is, even assuming all the facts

12

as given by Ms. Ortiz and taking -- treating those facts

13

as uncontroverted, still there was not a violation of

14

clearly established law.

that is a different question than from the question of

saying is you didn't even -- you didn't need to make the

22

base with Rule 50(a)?

23

MR. MIZER:

Is that what you're saying?
That is our position, yes, Your

24

Honor, because a legal issue is adequately preserved

25

once it's pressed and passed on in the district court.
32
Alderson Reporting Company

And to move for summary judgment on the issue is enough

2

to preserve a legal claim, the legal claim being not

that particular -- that sufficient evidence exists to

prove that particular conduct occurred, but rather that

5

the -- given all of that, that claim as assumed, still,

arguments being made at the 50(a) stage.

from Rule 50 that 50(a) and 50(b) go together, and the

MR. MIZER:

Our position is that the Sixth

4

this Court on that holding, that as a -- as a matter of

punitiveness, the Sixth Circuit held that that was not

38
Alderson Reporting Company

1

And she has not petitioned to this Court for review of

2

that holding by the Sixth Circuit, and so the only

question is the square Sandin question of whether

segregated confinement is an atypical and significant

5

hardship vis-à-vis the routine conditions of -- of her

confinement.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, wouldn't it be

MR. MIZER:

The -- again, the Sixth

Circuit's holding was that Sandin answered that -- that

question as a matter of clearly established law.

since Ms. Ortiz hasn't petitioned for review of the

merits of that question, I'm not sure how it's presented

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Mizer, is it your

understanding that -- that Unitherm was based on Seventh

decisions that in turn were grounded on considerations

of fairness to the verdict-winner, namely the

opportunity, when a -- a motion for judgment as a matter

It's different, Your Honor,

2

was looking at was the objective prong of whether or not

trial record, and assuming the worst of what she did or

6

didn't do, still her response was as a legal matter

7

objectively reasonable, and that was the Sixth Circuit's

8

holding.

9

So assuming all of the

And so, therefore, because that's a legal

10

inquiry, there was no 50(b) requirement even if Ms.

11

Ortiz had preserved the 50(b) argument.

12

The -- the -- Ms. Ortiz has also posited

13

that a collateral order appeal is a requirement in order

14

to preserve a qualified immunity claim.

15

is clearly foreclosed not only by the broad agreement

16

among the circuits but also by this Court's decisions in

17

United States v. Clark.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

That argument

When you go back -­

you're the one who has read these cases pretty

20

thoroughly, and as I looked at it, I -- with the

21

incomplete knowledge, I would have thought that

22

Justice Ginsburg's statement of it is basically right.

23

What Rule 50 is about is sufficiency of the evidence.

24

And 50(a) involves we're saying it won't be sufficient.

25

And 50(b) involves it wasn't sufficient.

It would work perfectly.

But apparently there's a Second Circuit

case, and some things in the treatises, that says

sometimes Rule 50(a) is being used for some other

purpose.

if you have a pure question of law, you ought to be

outside 50(a); you ought to be doing some other thing.

Circuit was reviewing a final judgment order, which was

6

not what the Sixth Circuit in fact said it was doing.

7

MR. MIZER:

Again, I would disagree that

8

that's what the Sixth Circuit said because of the

9

language at the bottom of page 7a of the petition

10

appendix, where they clearly say that it's an appeal

11

from the verdict.

12

And so because it's demonstrably not true

13

that they were treating the summary judgment order as

14

the final appealable order here, the question presented

15

by Ms. Ortiz is not actually presented by this case.

16

And the further arguments that a 50(b) motion was

17

required here under Unitherm were never made in the

18

Sixth Circuit and not made in her opening cert petition.

19

And so that argument also is not presented by this case.

20

And so I think the clear resolution is to

21

dismiss the case as improvidently granted, but if the

22

Court were inclined to the view that the merits should

23

be reached, then the clear rule that we posit resolves

14

MR. MIZER:

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

15

the lower courts, I think, are well-equipped to assess

16

whether or not an issue has adequately been pressed and

17

passed on in the district court.

18

That has been the settled rule of appellate

19

reviewability, and I don't think that it should be

changed by imposing a Rule 50(b) requirement for

12

Sixth Circuit's language when it said it was reviewing

15

-- in that decision, the Eighth Circuit said, yes, we

16

can review this after trial even though it was summary

the precise reasons the Sixth Circuit hinged its

on the officers' conduct at trial.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

9

So your rule, in

response to Justice Sotomayor, would basically require

10

anyone who has an assertion of qualified immunity to

11

take their collateral appeal or interlocutory appeal.

12

MR. MILLS:

It would only require it, Your

13

Honor, to the extent that they wish to challenge that

14

decision on the summary judgment record.

15

suggesting that that appeal is required to preserve the

16

issue of immunity.

17

extent a trial occurs on the officers' conduct -- and

18

the officers want to say, wait a second, we're still

19

immune -- that evidence even at trial is insufficient

20

for liability.

21

immunity issue, but you have to have the district court

22

consider the question.

23

I'm not at all

It's easily preserved, but to the

You've got the right to preserve your

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So they are put to a

24

choice whether or not their qualified immunity claim

25

rests entirely on law or might turn out, as you say it

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

That's right.

And they -­

Well, that's kind of

a tough choice to put them to, isn't it?
MR. MILLS:

Well, they have an absolute

6

right to take that immediate appeal, and -- and they

7

chose not to.

8
9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So they have to take

the immediate appeal, and when they do so, they lose the
right to appeal at the end?

11

MR. MILLS:

No, they do not.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. MILLS:

Well, why is that?

They do not because if they lose

14

the appeal and they go to trial, you've got a new case.

15

You've got -- I shouldn't say a new case.

16

new evidence of conduct.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

You've assumed -- you've

20

assumed all the evidence in their favor at the summary

21

judgment stage.

22

MR. MILLS:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So you really think that

24

this is a realistic scenario where there's going to be
