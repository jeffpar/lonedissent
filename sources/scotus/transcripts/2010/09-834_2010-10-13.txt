ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. KASTER

10

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KASTER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

When Kevin Kasten told his employer that the

12

location of the time clocks was illegal and that if they

13

were taken to the court they would lose, he filed any

14

complaint within the meaning of the 215(a)(3) under the

15

Fair Labor Standards Act, because filing includes an

16

oral communication, because "any" means any, which

17

includes formal or informal, written or unwritten

18

communications.

19

designed to have a broad construction under section 2 of

20

the statute 202 and under Mitchell v. DeMario and the

21

Tennessee Coal case.

22

And the words in the statute were

I would like to begin with the Tennessee

23

Coal case, Tennessee Coal v. Muscoda.

24

interpreted "work" in a broad fashion to include the

25

time in a mine when workers were moving from one place
3
Alderson Reporting Company

The Court

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to another, not actually engaged in physical labor.

2

In interpreting work that way, the Court

3

said that the act is not to be interpreted in a narrow,

4

grudging fashion.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me give you this

6

example.

7

that if you want to make a complaint, there's a

8

particular supervisor you should go to.

9

they say you can make this complaint in writing, you can

10
11

Suppose a company has an established policy

And let's say

make it orally.
Now, there's -- something's going on in the

12

workplace and the supervisor happens to be walking by,

13

maybe a machine is broken, an employee has been hurt,

14

and an employee walks up to the supervisor who is

15

walking briskly by, taps the supervisor on the shoulder

16

and says the company is violating the Fair Labor

17

Standards Act because of the placement of a clock.

18

said that filing has no formality requirement.

19

that be the filing of a complaint?

20

MR. KASTER:

You

Would

I think it would, Your Honor.

21

I don't think that the fact that the employer has a

22

policy that says you do it on Tuesday morning would

23

control what the statute says one way or the other, so I

24

think it would constitute a filing.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So you mean that if the

4
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Government says you've got to file a complaint with us

2

by either calling us or submitting something in writing,

3

and at a cocktail party a worker goes up to a Government

4

employee in that agency, and says, you know, my company

5

is violating the law.

6

That that's enough?

MR. KASTER:

I don't -- you know, I don't

7

believe that that's -- in the context of a non-work

8

environment, Your Honor, I would note that, I don't know

9

exactly the answer to the Court's question, to be

10

honest.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The reason I'm asking

12

that question is related to Justice Alito's question,

13

which is, what does filing a complaint mean?

14

have to be relative to the procedures adopted by the

15

person that you are reporting this to?

16

MR. KASTER:

Filing means directing it to

17

somebody who can do something about it.

18

necessarily have to be.

19

Does it

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it doesn't

Well, at a cocktail

20

party that employee may be there on personal time, but

21

when he goes back to work the next morning he could do

22

something.

23

Is that enough?
MR. KASTER:

Well, it may be.

If it's

24

directed towards the responsible party, then it would be

25

filing a complaint.

So it could occur outside of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what you are doing is

3

he is estopping the Government from saying, the only way

4

that you can file a complaint with us is to do it in

5

writing.

6

oral procedure even if it chose not to?

7

thought an oral procedure would create havoc, et cetera,

8

et cetera?

9

We are now forcing the Government to adopt an

Even if it

If the person is directing the

10

complaint to the Government and communicates that to the

11

responsible party who can do something about it, I think

12

that they are filing a complaint, Your Honor.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's one thing to say that

14

filing doesn't necessarily mean that something is

isn't it?

employee gets fired and the employee says, well, this

was done in retaliation for my having filed an FSLA

8

complaint three weeks ago, and the employer says what

We have no record of any such complaint and

supervisor who was passing by and my buddy Joe was there

Why do you feel the need to

initial stage of the grievance procedure, there is

16

confrontation with an eye to fact finding, and the

dispute is joined when the employee or the steward or

19

and hopefully to resolve a problem.

They use language like, at the

Now that's a formal kind of relationship.

But from you've said, I gather that you want to go well

24

beyond that and provide that cocktail parties -- perhaps

not cocktail parties, but just a tap on the shoulder

And there is a tradition as to how that works.

wouldn't compare the average workplace -足

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Suppose I think

7

that that provides a good precedent for -- for oral

filings.

10

What happens then?

MR. KASTER:

What am I supposed to do

Your Honor, in the general

11

proposition we would be accepting of the Scrivener rule

12

that the Court adopted in the '70s, that is that the

13

filing of a charge includes those things that happened

14

orally prior to and around the time of the filing of the

15

charge.

16

That's what this is about.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, we are talking about a

17

filing.

18

repeat it, but it seems to me form having read the brief

19

that filing takes place without writing, provided that

20

there are these other safeguards which are described.

The thing that I am looking at is the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That's correct, Your Honor.
So that would keep you

22

out, if that were the test, that you have to formally

23

invoke the grievance procedure.

24

every other time the word "file" is used in this Act,

25

Fair Labor Standards Act, it refers to a writing.

But we are told that

10

And

so you are urging a meaning that deviates from the

2

standard meaning of the term in the very Act at issue.

4

MR. KASTER:

I don't think I am doing that,

Your Honor, with all due respect.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there another

6

provision where the word file is used to mean something

7

other than a writing.

8

MR. KASTER:

It means, according to the

first enforcement action back in 1961, it means submit

by protecting against retaliation for somebody who has

Your -- the -- the Respondent is -- is going
11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

to argue that this statute doesn't apply to private

2

filings of complaints anyway, that it relates only to

3

the filing of a complaint with the government.

4

that -- that's a new -- a new point in this case, and

5

normally I would not be disposed to consider it.

And

6

My problem is, I cannot decide on -- on the

7

question of whether filing means filing only in writing

8

or also includes verbal filing, without resolving that

9

other question.

That is to say, if indeed the complaint

10

has to be quote, "filed" with the government, I'm

11

inclined to think that an oral complaint pursuant to

12

procedures established by the agency which permit an

13

oral complaint, even a complaint by telephone that would

14

be okay.

15

But my goodness, if it applies to private

16

employers as well including employers that have no

17

grievance procedures, including employers who have

18

employees who go to cocktail parties, I am -- I am very

19

disinclined to think that it -- that it could mean an

20

oral complaint in -- in that context.

21

MR. KASTER:

Your Honor, I'm just looking at

22

the statutory language -- file "any complaint."

important -- the word "any" has a particular meaning.

20

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

What -- what would you say

about his point that it seems to me had substantial

22

merit?

23

interpretation of what filing means might well depend on

24

whether filing in -- or a complaint includes

25

intracompany complaints, the grumbling of an employee

And it's easier

Memphis --the Memphis

Genesee Hospital is the only case in the

17

Second Circuit where they have held that all complaints

18

need to go to the Department of Labor.

would say about that particular argument, Your Honor.

20

Is it makes superfluous instituted proceeding.

21

superfluous instituted proceeding which -- or cause to

22

be instituted.

23

The one thing I

It makes

If you file a complaint -- it - then -- with

24

the Department of Labor, their argument is, and I think

25

it's true, that you institute a proceeding.
14
Alderson Reporting Company

So the

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

statute would be redundant, and "file any complaint"

2

would cover a null set.

3

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'm not sure that's true.

4

You -- you can complain orally to somebody at the Labor

5

Department who decides that the complaint isn't serious

6

enough to -- to warrant commencing a proceeding.

7

mean, if you go in and insist, I -- you know, I want to

8

begin a proceeding, that's -- that's something else.

9

But you can file a complaint orally without -- without

doing that, it seems to me.

11

MR. KASTER:

Well, Your Honor, if you have

12

made the phone call and started the process I think you

13

have instituted a proceeding.

14

what stage of formality it gets to, I'm not sure, Your

15

Honor, but I think you have begun the process of

16

instituting a proceeding or causing it to be instituted.

17

That's one.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So if he just says

to the employer, "You know, I think we ought to have a

assertion of statutory rights under the FLSA?

That's enough?

I think the test, Justice Alito,

is whether the employee has submitted a complaint to his

employer that has put the employer on notice that that

employee is asserting statutory rights under the FLSA,

19

claiming that he is legally entitled to something he is

way they would have understood it at the time, which was

to file any complaint, which as it would have been

understood in '38 and frankly after that, when you file

a complaint that usually entails some notion of

Would it work if they

instituted a proceeding orally and the proceeding

required itself to start orally?

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't -- the truth is, if

5

the employer envisions in its mind that it is

6

instituting a proceeding, that's still not a proceeding

7

within the meaning of what Congress meant in 1938.

8

had in mind an official action by a government agency.

And no private employer is ever going to institute a

proceeding within the meaning of that particular scheme.

11

You know, it's extremely important in the

12

context of this particular statute, and the one thing I

13

should have answered, Justice Sotomayor, to your

14

question is, what's different about this statute than

15

any other?

16

it.

This statute carries a criminal penalty with

And no other retaliation statute except for one -足

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there is a protection

built in, Mr. Phillips, it says it's criminal liability

19

only if it's willful.

20

liability under the Fair Labor Standards Act, you

21

certainly don't have to prove willful, you just prove a

22

violation.

23

And on the civil side, the civil

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but the reality is

24

that this Court held in the CIT case that the Court

25

would not construe this statute broadly in order to
29
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

expose people to potential criminal liabilities.

2

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Wouldn't any retaliatory

3

action be willful?

4

means you are firing this person because of the

5

complaint.

6

I mean, to say it's in retaliation

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The question is whether

7

the violation is willful.

The willful qualification in

8

the criminal context is are you willfully denying your

9

workers the wages and hours the statute requires?

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

12
13

Right.
Nothing to do with

retaliation.
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, I -- well, it does have

14

something to do with retaliation, but, Justice Ginsburg,

15

it seems to me it's all of a piece, though.

16

reason why you can be comfortable with a willfulness

17

standard even which extends to conscious disregard

18

beyond the intent as well, but the reason why you can be

19

comfortable with that is if you look at the way the

20

statute is crafted in terms of the retaliation provision

21

itself, it speaks specifically to formal actions that

22

are taken, the filing of a complaint, the institution of

23

a proceeding.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because the

Do you know, how common

is it to have criminal prosecutions under this section
30
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

of the Fair Labor Standards Act?

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't believe -- I mean,

3

it's not a null set, but I don't believe it's a

proceedings.

in a narrow way, and why this provision is aimed not

generally to protect workers, but is aimed really to

But it seems to me, though, in trying to

10

make sure that information gets to the Federal

11

Government.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought that the whole

13

idea of this statute is to protect the workers, and I

14

would like you to address particularly the amici's

15

point, that this statute in 1938 affected people -- many

16

were illiterate, they couldn't write a complaint, many

17

were immigrants who weren't familiar with the language,

18

for that universe of people, wouldn't Congress have

19

meant that all complaints are okay?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

Let me start by saying, first

21

of all, even if the FLSA has broadly a pro employee

22

protective purpose, it's still important to recognize

23

that the retaliation provision we are talking about here

24

specifically did not provide a cause of action, a

25

private cause of action until 1977.
31
Alderson Reporting Company

So that when

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Congress enacted this statute in 1938, it didn't say boo

2

about allowing the employees to show up in court and to

3

assert their rights.

4

expansive, grant rights to the employee's portion of

5

this legislation.

6

This is not part of that

And then second, Justice Ginsburg, with

7

respect to the specifics of what did Congress have in

8

mind, it seems to me the better way to evaluate this is

9

not did Congress have in mind a group of illiterate

10

employees or not, but what language did Congress use in

11

trying to formulate the specific provision that gives

12

rise to the protections against retaliation.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Your case would be a lot

14

easier if you didn't try to have it both ways, to say,

applies to written complaints to the Government.

I will take the former

argument, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Why don't you give a break

22

to the illiterate and let them file oral complaints with

23

the Government?

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, my guess is the truth

is they will be able to file oral complaints with the
32
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Government because, the only thing that is left open is

2

the precise hypothetical you gave, Justice Scalia, where

3

you make an oral complaint and nothing gets instituted

4

in those circumstances.

5

the Federal Government's authority to simply adopt a

6

rule that says any time anybody makes an oral complaint

7

to us we will institute a proceeding.

8

adopted that view, I don't think there is anything we

9

could do about it.

10

And it seems to me, clearly, in

JUSTICE SCALIA:

And if the agency

Suppose it says we won't

necessarily institute a proceeding, but we will regard

it as a complaint?

MR. PHILLIPS:

I -- I mean, my own view is

14

the better way of reading -- that is a much closer case,

15

I will concede that, Justice Scalia.

16

that when you talking about file a complaint, that is

17

just not the way Congress ordinarily thinks about file a

18

complaint.

19

sorry.

20

My own view is

going to institute a proceeding or not.

For example, the EEOC, people often file

Right.
33

Alderson Reporting Company

And I'm not

Official - Subject to Final Review

quarrelling with that.

2

the truth is, you know, I think for another day the

3

issue will arise and the Court can decide whether or not

4

a mere oral complaint to a government agency is

5

sufficient to file a complaint within the meaning of

6

this statute.

7

I mean, I understand that.

And

I do think it is fundamentally important for

8

this Court to decide the underlying question of whether

9

oral complaints are sufficient only in the context in

10

the first instance of deciding whether or not it has to

11

go to a government agency as opposed to any kind of

12

private or intracorporate activity.

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, the vast majority of

22

those statutes talk about any action that -- opposing a

practice, and therefore they deal with a lot of

intracorporate activities, and obviously at some point

there is an issue as to sort of what the employer's

8
9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Has there

Well, I suspect that issue

comes up almost every day, and it is a problem; but it's

10

a problem that Congress made a judgment that we would

11

rather go ahead and allow those matters to be litigated;

12

and language that is very expansive in protecting

13

employees from retaliation.

14

at that at times as a managing partner of a law firm, I

15

recognize that that is the judgment that Congress made.

And while I -- I may chafe

16

Here we are talking about a Congress that

17

made a very different judgment about how it wanted to

18

protect retaliation.

19

made, it seems to me, very much in the context of 1938.

20

Justice Sotomayor, you are very right; they were not

21

sure they even had constitutional authority to be

22

adopting this approach; and they are attaching to it

23

criminal sanctions, and they are not providing a private

24

right of action; and in that context it seems to me that

25

this Court should comfortably say that this is a much

JUSTICE BREYER:

How do we know?

I mean,

all right, if you want to get into it, this is a very

25

minor sort of interstitial point in a statute that they

where the Court has said, where these minor matters of

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

But Justice Breyer, that

7

would strike me as a more persuasive argument if

8

Congress hadn't -- hadn't delegated to the Secretary of

9

Labor specific rulemaking authority with respect to

10

specific provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and

11

does not have a similar provision in connection with

back to the legislative history there is a colloquy

between the two Senators, and I recognize some members

of the Court are unenthusiastic -- but -- but you know,

in that colloquy, they talk about malicious complaints,

about where you have essentially defamed your employer

It could be

that they are thinking of malicious complaints and they

neither their language nor their purpose, as history

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think if you are

going back and trying to figure out what the Congress of

5

1938 had in mind, the best way to do that is to look at

the language chosen and the company that that language

keeps.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And there's been -- you

said there was no evidence of the government for

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I mean, that -- in the

brief we identified a number of places where Congress

5

uses the word "proceedings," and every place where they

6

use the word "proceedings" they have in mind an official

7

Government activity.

8

reasonable -- logical way to read this particular

9

language as incorporating that.

10

And so I think it is the most

Of course, even if that were true, even if

11

you would preserve that, that still wouldn't be a basis

for going forward with this case, because there was no

actions that were taken.

MR. PHILLIPS:

because of the fact that the way this is all set up is

2

the -- and the -- it's just the narrowness of the Fair

Labor Standards Act.

4

And, Justice Ginsburg, to your question

5

about the subsequent legislation that has all been

6

enacted, it seems to me in a lot of ways that that

7

reinforces the core interpretive approach that I have

8

taken in this case, because if it were absolutely clear

9

that the language about filing a complaint and

10

instituting a proceeding were as broad as -- certainly

11

as the Petitioner proposes in this case, where any kind

12

of oral grumbling is sufficient, Congress never would

13

have needed to deviate from that template and all the

14

legislation that came afterwards.

15

And there are tons of statutes that say:

16

File a complaint, institute a proceeding, and otherwise

17

oppose.

Congress to do that if this language would have

19

accomplished precisely the same thing.

And there would have been no reason for

for the Petitioner's counsel than you, but are you aware

Isn't -- in the work setting that's being

employee to complain first to the employer rather than

making a Federal case out of it by complaining to a
