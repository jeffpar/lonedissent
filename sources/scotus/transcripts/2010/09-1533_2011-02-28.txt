Mr. Pincus.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PINCUS:

9
10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The question in this case is whether the

11
12

dramatically harsher mandatory minimum penalty for what

13

the statute terms cocaine base applies to all offenses

14

involving cocaine or only those involving substances

15

with the characteristics of crack cocaine.

16

in the Kimbrough case, the government described the

17

provision at issue here as reflecting Congress's

18

determination that, and I'm quoting, "crimes involving

19

crack should be subject to considerably more severe

20

penalties."

21

In its brief

We agree.
Congress's targeting of a limited subset of

22

the substances qualifying chemically as -- as cocaine is

23

manifest in the statutory structure, in the language,

24

for three basic reasons.

25

page 2 of our blue brief, which has the relevant

And I'm going to be looking at

statutory provision.
First, the only way to give different

2
3

meaning to two distinct terms that Congress used in the

4

statute -- "cocaine" on the one hand and "cocaine base"

5

on the other -- is to make clear that cocaine base means

6

something different than all substances with the

7

chemical formula C17H21NO4.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

8
9

Mr. Pincus, if -- if I

understand your interpretation correctly, it would

10

exclude freebase.

How is that a sensible interpretation

11

of the statute, one that would exclude freebase, a

12

commonly known substance?

13

The Richard Pryor incident had occurred.

14

it was dangerous.

15

meant to incorporate that substance as well?

Everybody knew

Wasn't it at least true that Congress

MR. PINCUS:

16

Congress was aware of it.

Let me answer -- answer your

17

question with a little bit of detail, Justice Kagan,

18

because I think our reply brief wasn't as clear as it

19

might have been, because the word "freebase" has,

20

really, three different meanings.

21

manufacturing process; it means a method of use of a

22

cocaine-related substance; and it also means a

23

substance.

24
25

So just to be clear:

It means a

Freebase, the

manufacturing process, occurs when cocaine

Alderson Reporting Company

1

hydrochloride, the powder form of cocaine, is mixed with

2

ether and ammonia in a very volatile mixture and boiled.

3

Most -- many users of freebase inhale the fumes that are

4

released during that manufacturing process.

5

process is very dangerous, as the Richard Pryor incident

6

showed, because the substance is quite volatile and will

7

explode.

8

used then, but goes to the very end, when all of the

9

liquids are boiled off, then it does produce a rock-like

10
11

That

If that process -- if the substance is not

substance similar to crack cocaine.
Our submission is that the -- if the

12

substance is permitted to go to the end, and if, in

13

effect, ether and ammonia are used as a substitute for

14

sodium bicarbonate, then the substance does qualify

15

under the statute, because it is a rock-like substance

16

that has -- is chemically cocaine, and was produced in a

17

method similar to the reacting of sodium bicarbonate

18

with baking soda.

19

But in -- when the process is in the middle

20

of the production process, we don't think Congress meant

21

to reach that for a couple of reasons.

22

because that was -- is -- that substance is not

23

something that's easily marketable.

24

things that Congress was concerned about was the

25

marketability of crack cocaine in its rock-like form.

That's what made the really big difference.

6

outside the category cocaine base?

7

So why doesn't it

It's a rock-like substance.

MR. PINCUS:

Why should it be

Well, I think there would be a

8

factual question in this case.

9

below, Justice Ginsburg, determined whether, in fact,

10

this -- the substance at issue in this case was crack

11

cocaine, because the district court ruled that that

12

wasn't necessary, that all chemical -- as long as the

13

substance chemically qualified as cocaine, it satisfied

14

the statutory requirement, and the First Circuit agreed.

15

So in this case, there -­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

None of the courts

Correct me if am I wrong

17

about this -- I may have a misimpression -- but I

18

thought you were objecting to a charge to the jury that

19

charged cocaine base and didn't charge crack.

20

MR. PINCUS:

We're -- we're objecting to

21

the -- the fact that the district judge charged the jury

22

and himself determined that in order for this very

23

severe 100-to-1 penalty to apply, it was not necessary

24

for the substance to qualify as crack cocaine.

25

had to do was to be a chemical form of cocaine.

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we agree with you, how

should a judge instruct a jury to determine whether a

substance is crack?

in the sentencing guidelines?

Should the judge use the definition

MR. PINCUS:

5

A judge could use the

6

definition in the sentencing guidelines, Your Honor.

7

Let me just say, as a threshold question, in many cases

8

this won't be a jury question.

25

the second of those characteristics; isn't that right?
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

It was -- it would not be prepared using a base?
MR. PINCUS:

2

It would, because ammonia is

3

one of the -- is one of -- it's ammonia and ether that

4

have -- that are used to prepare freebase.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MR. PINCUS:

So if it had any base?

Any base.

We are -- the lower

7

courts, in applying the sentencing guidelines

8

definition, have said that sodium bicarbonate is not

9

required.

We think it is not required.

They've

10

recognized other substances, and we think as long as the

11

process is similar, that that's what the sentencing

12

guidelines capture, that's what the statute captures.

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I don't understand that.

I

14

can understand the argument that -- that Congress was -­

15

was directing its statute at crack, and crack had -- had

16

a very definite meaning, which didn't include any

17

substance that -- that is rock-hard and has been

18

produced in the manner you suggest.

19

You're coming up -- you're urging upon us a

20

definition that neither is the definition of crack nor

21

is the chemical definition of cocaine base.

22

neither fish nor fowl.

MR. PINCUS:

Scalia, I think that Congress was focused on crack.

But you

That's not the meaning you want us to

MR. PINCUS:

6

That's right.

Well, we do -- we do want the

7

meaning to be a substance with those particular

8

characteristics.

9

we're -- that we're debating is whether baking -- the

10

use of baking soda is essential, because all of those

11

other -- those other three characteristics are

12

characteristics of crack.

I think the only question that

13

JUSTICE SCALIA:

14

MR. PINCUS:

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

16

if it weren't made that way, would you?
MR. PINCUS:

17

It's essential to crack.

Well -­
You wouldn't call it crack

Well, I think in 1986, the

18

definitions were not that clear.

And I think the

19

sentencing commission has said, and certainly the lower

20

courts have said, both in applying the limited

21

definition of the statute for which we contend and also

22

in interpreting the sentencing guidelines, that the use

23

of a different base gets at what Congress -- is still a

24

category of substance that Congress -- Congress cared

25

about.
9
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Obviously, if the Court would like to

2

construe the statute more narrowly and say baking soda

3

is required, we wouldn't object to that.

4

that Congress -- one of the reasons that Congress used

5

the term "cocaine base" was that it was trying to

6

capture a category of substances that had particular

7

characteristics and wasn't focused so much on the exact

8

chemical formula that went into it, because Congress

9

knew, in the drug area, it would -­

MR. PINCUS:

15

It has to be -- it has to be

I don't know how "cocaine

Well, I think in -- in three

16

ways, Your Honor.

First of all, because Congress didn't

17

use the term "cocaine," which is used elsewhere in the

18

provision, it clearly meant a subset.

19

all of the -- all of the substances with the chemical

20

formula that satisfies the chemical term "cocaine."

It didn't mean

Second of all, the statute shows just by the

21
22

100-to-1 ratio that Congress was focused on something

23

that was especially dangerous, much more dangerous than

24

powder.

25

Third, the legislative context was, as the
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court said in Kimbrough, that this was a statute that

2

was enacted in response to a particular problem, and I

3

think the question we're debating is:

4

have said, when it defined the term -- when it defined

5

the term "cocaine base" -- and I should say, "base" was

6

one of the street terms, colloquial terms, that was used

7

at the time to -- to describe these categories of

8

substances.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

9

MR. PINCUS:

10

All of them or just crack?

It was -- "freebase" was a

11

word.

12

the legislative debate didn't distinguish necessarily

13

the chemical -- the chemical process for creating the

14

substance.

15

characteristics that had led to the epidemic that

16

Congress was concerned with, and those characteristics

17

were easy marketability, because it was a solid,

18

incredibly strong addictive potential, and inhalability.

19

"Base" was a word.

Would Congress

"Crack" was a word.

The -­

What it focused on was a substance that had

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, the

20

provision refers to "a mixture or substance which

21

contains cocaine base."

22

crack, so you have to be talking about a mixture or

23

substance which contains crack.

Crack is the problem they're getting at; yet the

25

statute, as you read it, has to talk about a substance

MR. PINCUS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's kind of an odd

10

way for Congress -- it's an odd way for Congress to

phrase the provision if what they want to get at is

12

crack, to say what we want to get at is substance which

13

contained crack.

14

about substances that contain something, what they

15

contain is a base that then is used in the substance.

16

think that's a harder, harder logic to apply when you're

17

talking about crack.

18

crack, not so much -- it wouldn't occur naturally that

19

they're talking about substances which contain crack.

20

It would occur naturally, that language formulation, if

21

you think of cocaine base as broader than just crack.

22

That suggests to me, when you talk

They want to stop the use of

MR. PINCUS:

Respectfully, I disagree, Mr.

Chief Justice.

Congress is sensitive in crafting the drug laws that

5

6

other impurities.

7

laws Congress has used that and we think that's exactly

8

why it used a similar phrase here, because the crack

rock does not contain 100 percent chemical cocaine in a

12

13

substances, and Congress needed that language to avoid

14

defendants saying:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You kind of elided

18

the point there in your verbal formulation.

19

to say this is something that's not just cocaine.

20

harder to say this is something which is not just crack

21

because crack is a type of cocaine.

22

contains, as the government says, cocaine base.

23

MR. PINCUS:

It's easier
It's

Alderson Reporting Company

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

2

And you're saying

3

Congress is afraid that the sodium bicarbonate, we might

4

not be able to get at that if we just say crack?
MR. PINCUS:

5

No, that the defendant, that

6

the defendant would say this -- if it doesn't, if it

7

didn't say a mixture which contains, if it said cocaine

8

9

you have to distill the substance to find out how much

10

cocaine base is actually in it, as opposed to how much

11

of it actually is cocaine in a rock form, as opposed to

12

other things have been mixed in, instead of, as this

13

Court decided in Chapman, it's the whole package that

14

one weighs.

15

And so I think Congress was getting at the

16

idea that it didn't want people to either avoid the

17

question that Justice Alito is asking, whether the

MR. PINCUS:

I think that the government

doesn't have to produce -- doesn't have to make a

It can -- it is enough for the

government's chemist -- and there's always a chemist

that's true.
I think -- I think as a fallback we would

5
6

certainly be happy with the definition that just had the

7

first and the third ingredients in what I've said, but I

8

think the second is important because one of the things

that Congress was focused on was the potency of the

10

crack and crack-like substance.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

11

Mr. Pincus, you've lost me.

12

You've responded to the Chief Justice when he raised the

13

problem that this has to be not just cocaine base, it

14

has to be a mixture containing cocaine base, you

15

responded to him by saying:

16

mixture in it; it's never -- it's never pure; and that's

17

why crack would be covered.

Well, crack always has some

pulverize it.

It is an extra clear, extra

that there's a good reason that Congress did that.

the preceding provision in Romanette (ii), Congress was

defining the whole world of cocaine-related substances.

It didn't need to distinguish between the different

Why is it

The base form has to be

7

somewhere in Romanette (ii), because the way that

8

Congress drafted these two provisions together is that a

9

large amount of substances are listed in Romanette (ii)

10

and then a subset is pulled out in Romanette (iii).

11

Romanette (iii) says, you know, 50 grams or more of a

Ms. Saharsky, just a strange statute, where you are -­

your definition creates all kinds of issues about why it

is that Congress used two different phrases to mean the

same thing, and then how it is that if they did use two

14

effectively reading cocaine out of the statute in

Romanette (ii), right?
MS. SAHARSKY:

16

No.

I think that that's

17

based on a misunderstanding of how the statute works.

18

You need to have "cocaine" in Romanette (ii) so that

19

when Romanette (iii) says something contained in (ii)

20

that contains cocaine base, it is pulling out a

substance that is in (ii).

same as cocaine base.

MS. SAHARSKY:

That's a strange

That is how Congress wrote

the statute, though.

It defined a large amount of

substances and then it pulled out one substance.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

But why would it say apples

cost one dollar in Romanette (ii) if it was going to say

8

apples cost three dollars in Romanette (iii)?
MS. SAHARSKY:

Because these definitions in

MS. SAHARSKY:

It includes the first and

Yes, you are 100 percent

correct, and I think that the statutory language makes

12

that clear because it says it has to be a mixture of

13

I don't think that there is

evidence that paste is less addictive than powder.

They

contain the exact same chemical, which is cocaine in its

base form.

really wanted to make is that, you know, once the court

know, any of those things can be changed.

The one thing

11

that can't be changed is the chemical composition.

12

still in the base form; it's still deadly; it still can

13

be smoked.

It's

The paste doesn't have to be yellow, just

22

but holistically, what Congress was concerned about was

25

dangerous chemicals.

This gets back to the point that the Chief

2

Justice made, which is the reference in the provision at

5

Do you have a substance which may not be 100 percent

6

pure; it's sold on the street; but does it contain the

And just to -- to make sure the Court has

that would be caused if the Court started making up

25

definitions of crack, you know, a word that doesn't

2

meaning -- you know, Petitioner says it wasn't clear in

3

1986, the definition of crack -- I just want to give the

4

Court an example of some of the problems that the -- the

5

issues the courts of appeals have confronted.
In several courts of appeals there have been

6
7

substances which I think perhaps under Justice Breyer's

8

definition would qualify as paste.

9

call them paste, but in the Bryant case in the Fifth

10

Circuit they said there was a brown, soft, mushy wet

11

substance that contained cocaine base was being brought

12

in the United States.

13

Circuit:

The courts didn't

Those courts are ones that use the chemical

14
15

definition of cocaine base, and they said, look, they

16

contain cocaine base, they have the deadly chemicals,

17

they count.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, my understanding of

19

how coke -- how the paste is produced is the following:

20

You start with the leaves; then people vigorously

21

macerate the leaves by stomping on them for an hour or

22

more; and then this mixture is -- this -- what's left is

23

mixed with an alkaline material such as sodium

24

bicarbonate, an organic solvent, such as kerosene, and

25

water; and what you end up with is a gummy, yellowish
45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

solid called coca paste; is that -- that's correct?
MS. SAHARSKY:

2

Yes, that's true.

But it

3

also can be dried.

It can -- can be dried and smoked;

4

it has been dried in South America, so it's not always

5

wet, it's just a question of, you know, whether it has

6

had time to dry or not.
JUSTICE ALITO:

7

Yes.

Now, if a chemist

8

analyzed that or then analyzed crack or freebase,

9

wouldn't there be present in the coca paste lots of

10

other substances that would not be present, in

11

quantities?

12

quantities in the coca paste that would not be present

13

in the crack or the freebase?

14

Other substances would be present in

MS. SAHARSKY:

Well, they all -- any of

15

those would have impurities that are not cocaine base.

16

All three of them would be identically -- chemically

17

identical if that they would all contain cocaine base;

18

but you're right; the impurities would be different

19

because the method of preparation would be different.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

So a DEA chemist could test

21

-- could test a substance and say this is coca paste of

22

the type that is smoked in South America by some people.

23

This is crack or freebase that has been mixed with water

24

into a pasty substance -- a chemist could make that -­

25

that differentiation, couldn't they?
46

MS. SAHARSKY:

I think it really depends,

2

Your Honor.

I think if it's just a -- a regular DEA

3

chemist, they would be able to tell you what chemicals

4

they can find through standard techniques like infrared

5

spectroscopy, like gas chromatography, and they can say

6

we've identified these chemicals in this substance.

7

Unless it is a chemist -- and we do have some that have

8

additional knowledge of methods of preparation, DEA

9

agents who have that kind of experience, have seen it

10

prepared -- those chemists -- regular chemists would not

11

be testifying about how it was prepared.
For example in this case the chemist

testified that the -- the sample had cocaine base, it

14

did not have detectable amounts of sodium bicarbonate,

and then defense counsel said well is -- is this -- do

you think that it's -- or I'm sorry, the chemist, the

those questions.

22

I can tell you scientifically what it

And that -- that's really the -- the issue

23

of proof, is that you can tell chemically that it has

24

the substance that Congress was trying to get at, the

25

cocaine base.

I suppose you can tell what other

Alderson Reporting Company

impurities are there, but you know, Congress doesn't

You know, one -- one other thing that I just

5
6

want to make sure is clear to the Court, is that there

7

was ample testimony before Congress at the time that it

8

enacted this provision about the chemistry of this all,

9

that when Congress spoke about cocaine base, it was

10

understanding that base meant chemically the base form,

11

and that again is near the pages I cited to Justice

drug is the freebase, the usual kind of cocaine is a

17

like sodium chloride.

19

to it, it is freebase, which is just plain cocaine.

But two different scientists, one

what would normally be called cocaine.

when Congress in 1986 was faced with a situation where

2

courts, including this Court, had used the term cocaine

3

to refer imprecisely to the cocaine hydrochloride form

4

and Congress was going to put a mandatory minimum

5

penalty in place, Congress had every incentive to be

6

extra clear, and that's exactly what we think that

Congress was doing here.

to Romanette (iii), you have 50 grams or more of a

So just to wrap up and be as clear as

chemicals that -- that have certain pharmacological

Just a couple of points.
First of all, in response to Justice

22

Breyer's question, the 2002 sentencing report where -­

sentencing commission report on this issue, on page 110,

24

recommends to Congress that substances other than crack

should be excluded from Clause 3, and I'm quoting,

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

"because they do not present the heightened concerns

2

associated with crack cocaine."
JUSTICE BREYER:

3

Yes, but she says there's

4

no way -- and she does cite this professor from Yale and

5

so forth, who says if the stuff has the base in it, it

6

can be abused in ways that if it has the salt in it, it

7

can't be abused.

That's all we can look at.

8

MR. PINCUS:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11

her point.

But Your Honor, I -­
That's her point.

That's

You can respond to that if you want.
MR. PINCUS:

I think that is her point.

But

12

I think the question here -- all of these substances are

13

criminalized, and they're all going to be penalized.

14

The question is:

15

That, to us, means something that Congress was

16

especially concerned about, and certainly, because the

17

government agrees that cocaine hydrochloride is only in

18

2, something that's worse than cocaine hydrochloride,

19

which is a pretty bad thing.

20

there's no reason to imagine that Congress meant to

21

punish paste more than cocaine hydrochloride.

22

What deserves the 100-to-1 sanction?

JUSTICE BREYER:

As Judge Posner said,

She says there is a reason.

23

It's because it contains base, and for many years, it

24

was smoked in Latin America and can be smoked here.

25

That's her reason.

Now, your response is, it's a bad
51
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

reason?
MR. PINCUS:

2

Our response is that it is -­

3

it does not have the potency that crack had.

4

smoked here and didn't give rise to the epidemic that

5

occurred once crack was created, because that was more

6

potent, more marketable, and led to all the evils that

7

Congress was trying to get at.
Second point:

8
9

It was

We would be very happy to

accept your definition.

10

Third point, about the statutory language:

11

I think the critical question here, as several members

12

of the Court have noted, is that "cocaine" -- not just

13

in Romanette (ii), but throughout the statute -- means

14

all chemical forms of cocaine.

15

meant in (iii), there was no reason to just -- not to

16

just say it.

17

chemical meaning, but the word "base" was also in this

18

debate as a word that was being used to describe the

19

specific evil that Congress was aimed at.

20

think, at the worst, there's ambiguity here.

21

If that's what Congress

The words "cocaine base" could have a

And so we

We think it's quite clear that by using

22

those different terms, Congress meant something

23

different, but at worst, there's ambiguity here.

ambiguity, under the rule of lenity, means that the

25

clause should be construed narrowly.

everything that is in clause 2 is in clause 3 under the

4

government's interpretation, because clause 2, Roman

5

(II), has the word "cocaine," and clause 2, Roman (IV),

6

says any compound mixture or whatever containing

7

cocaine.

8

will never, ever be invoked, because every offense that

9

uses cocaine is sanctionable under 3.

Under the government's theory, that provision

Every murder, every murder, is a homicide.
MR. PINCUS:

13

It's the same with homicide

Yes, but the question here is

14

whether every homicide -- whether every lesser form of

15

homicide is also capital murder.

16

government's position means:

17

homicide, everything that's in (II) that sets up a

18

punishment, is also in (III), and we think that's the

19

problem with their interpretation.

And what the

maybe it was, then the rule of lenity should apply, and

Congress can fix it.

statute.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume for the

3

sake of a hypothetical that the statute was the same but

4

that things were reversed; that the smaller universe of

5

items was the salt rather than the crack, and so they

6

put an enhancement in Roman numeral number (III) for

7

salt rather than crack.
Is your argument that it's redundant based

8
9

on the fact that a larger grouping of the chemicals

10

listed in Roman numeral number (II) is excluded by Roman

11

numeral number (III), so that -- is that the basis of

12

your argument?
MR. PINCUS:

13

That particular argument would

14

still apply.

15

the question, is that in this -- in the government's

16

interpretation, the word "cocaine" and the word "cocaine

17

base" -- the phrase "cocaine base" have the same

18

meaning.

19

our argument would be harder, but it is present here.

Our principal argument, if I may answer

That evil wouldn't be present, and therefore,
