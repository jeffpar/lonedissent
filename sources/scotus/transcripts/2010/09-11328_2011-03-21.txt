ORAL ARGUMENT OF ORIN S. KERR

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. KERR:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This case raises the intersection of two

12

similar doctrines of the same vintage that point in

13

exactly opposite directions:

14

and the second, the good faith exception.

15

should reverse and hold that the good faith exception

16

does not apply to reliance on precedent, and instead,

17

that should be governed by the retroactivity principles

18

of Griffith v. Kentucky.

19

The first, retroactivity;
This Court

I think it's helpful to start with

20

Linkletter v. Walker, the 1965 decision that introduced

21

the concept of retroactivity.

22

Mapp v. Ohio, which had held that the exclusionary rule

23

applied to State violations of the Fourth Amendment, is

24

not retroactive.

25

on a simple syllogism:

Linkletter held that

The Linkletter decision was premised
The exclusionary rule is about
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

deterrence; a decision that postdates a search cannot

2

deter the police; and therefore, the exclusionary rule

3

should not be available in cases before Mapp.

4

Linkletter's syllogism is the same syllogism

5

that the Court is attempting -- that, sorry, the

6

government is attempting to rely on in this case.

7

History has shown that that syllogism is powerful in the

8

context of collateral review and habeas corpus

9

proceedings, but it should not apply on direct review.

10

It should not apply on direct review for two

11

basic reasons.

12

first case must be treated like other cases on direct

13

review, the exclusionary rule must be available in order

14

to protect the adversary process and avoid advisory

15

opinions, which -­

16

First, because on direct review the

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Excuse me.

You lose me in

17

the argument because it doesn't seem to me that we -- if

18

we did apply the good faith rule, we would be denying

19

retroactive effect to the altered judgment.

20

continues to apply to matters beforehand, but it's a

21

totally different question whether, assuming it is

22

retroactive, the good faith exception to the

23

exclusionary rule applies.

24

question from retroactivity, it seems to me.

25

MR. KERR:

It

It's a -- it's a separate

I disagree, Justice Scalia.
4

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

During the Linkletter period, the scope of the

2

exclusionary rule for the Fourth Amendment was an

3

essential concern in a series of retroactivity cases,

4

Linkletter being the first, Desist v. United States

5

being the second.

6

era retroactivity cases were concerned with the Fourth

7

Amendment exclusionary rule.

8

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

9

There were -- many of the Linkletter

Justice Scalia's point:

Yes, but just to pursue

The good faith rule is itself a

10

rule that's intact, that's a precedent, that was on the

11

books, and the good faith rule qualifies the

12

exclusionary rule.

13

good faith rule here?

14

MR. KERR:

15

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

So why aren't we just following the

The -­
I mean, there's nothing

16

retroactive or prospective about it.

17

just applying the existing law.
MR. KERR:

18

It's just -- it's

I disagree, Justice Kennedy.

19

It's not applying existing law, because the effect of

20

what is labeled the good faith exception in this setting

21

is actually to apply the prior decision; that is, to

22

have all of the substance and effect of a retroactivity

23

decision.

24
25

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Well, that's an

application of -- that's a subset, it's one application,
5
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

of the good faith rule, which is an overall principle.

2

But we're being faithful, under the government's view,

3

it seems to me, to the overall principle.

4

MR. KERR:

I think the Court needs to take

5

away the labels here.

The government is using a label

6

of good faith for what is essentially a retroactivity

7

argument.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

8
9

It's not a label at all.

You're -- we're not denying the application of the

10

altered rule to your client's conduct.

11

the question of whether, when it does apply, the good

12

faith disregard of it by a police officer nonetheless

13

allows the evidence to be admitted, it's a totally

14

different -- we're giving full retroactive effect to

15

the -- to the change in the law.
MR. KERR:

16

It applies.

But

At the same time, Justice Scalia,

17

whatever rule is applied in this case would have to be

18

the same rule that applies in Gant itself, and without

19

the incentive of counsel to argue in favor of the change

20

in the law, that would block claims by defense attorneys

21

to overturn the precedents of this Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

22

Well, Mr. Kerr, our

23

cases have talked about the deterrence impact on police

24

conduct.

25

notion to cover incentives for defendants, and as I

It seems to me you're trying to expand that

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

read -- I guess it's Leon, in footnote 25, it says the

2

argument that defendants will lose their incentive to

3

litigate meritorious Fourth Amendment claims as a result

4

of a good faith exception is -- is unpersuasive.
MR. KERR:

5

Leon, I think, raised a different

6

setting.

It raised the question of reliance on errors

7

by a magistrate judge, which simply does not implicate

8

the concerns of retroactivity, which is this Court

9

changing its interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.

10

think that raises a distinct set of principles, as

11

Justice Harlan recognized in his dissent in Desist and

12

his separate opinion -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I

Well, I think our -­

14

our theory on the exclusionary rule across the board,

15

without regard to the underlying substantive violation,

16

is that you look to deterrence of police conduct.

17

here, I mean -- I mean, you agree the police did nothing

18

wrong in this case, don't you?

19

MR. KERR:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21
22

And

Yes.
So what impact -­

why do we want to deter them from doing what's right?
MR. KERR:

Because it takes two branches of

23

government for the exclusionary rule to deter

24

constitutional violations.

25

construe the Fourth Amendment and the police need to

The Court has to properly

7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

then properly follow the Court's precedents.

2

can't turn away from the role of this Court's precedents

3

in the enforcement of the Fourth Amendment.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

The Court

Well, I understand your

5

argument with respect to decisions of this Court, and I

6

think that's your strongest argument, but would you

7

concede that that argument does not apply when the

8

precedent on which the police are relying is a decision

9

of one of the courts of appeals or a State supreme court

10
11

Fourth Amendment decision?
In that situation, there will be plenty of

12

avenues for obtaining review of the correctness of those

13

decisions; isn't that right?

14

MR. KERR:

Justice Alito, I think it depends

15

on what the good faith exception is.

16

brief I think does not exactly articulate what the

17

standard is that -- to which it would like to apply.

18

The government's

Even so, most Circuit Court decisions

19

interpreting the Fourth Amendment are derivative of this

20

Court's decisions interpreting the Fourth Amendment.

21

And this case is a good example.

22

are quite similar to the facts of Belton.

23

Circuit had not actually expanded upon Belton; it had

24

merely had relatively routine applications of Belton.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

The facts of this case
The Eleventh

Well, it applied its

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

understanding of Belton, which turned out to be

2

different from the understanding of the Arizona Supreme

3

Court in Gant and the understanding of at least four

4

members of this Court when Gant got here.
MR. KERR:

5

At the same time, the Eleventh

6

Circuit's development of the law was -- went no further

7

than Belton itself, and this Court needs adversaries to

8

make forthright arguments to this Court which may

9

involve distinguishing precedent and may involve

10

overturning precedent.
JUSTICE ALITO:

11

If I could just come back to

12

my question:

13

courts of appeals that says certain conduct is permitted

14

under the Fourth Amendment, and the police in that

15

circuit, Federal law enforcement officers in that

16

circuit, follow that precedent.

17

Suppose you have a decision in one of the

Now, is -- will there not be plenty of

18

opportunities to review the correctness of that decision

19

because the issue may arise in other circuits where the

20

matter isn't settled?

21

MR. KERR:

If this Court adopts a good faith

22

exception that is quite narrow and would not allow an

23

officer in one circuit to reasonably rely on the clear

24

circuit court decisions of another circuit, that's

25

certainly a possibility.

However, it's not clear as to
9

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

why the Court would adopt such a narrow version of the

2

exception.

3

at least, seems to be the language of qualified

4

immunity; the notion of reasonable reliance on a

5

decision being believed to be lawful.

6

The language that the government proposes,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Kerr, the line that

7

has been suggested by Justice Scalia and Justice

8

Kennedy, that is exactly the line that the Eleventh

9

Circuit took; is it not the case?

10

I mean, Judge Kravitch said:

Yes, the

11

Fourth Amendment was violated, so to that extent we're

12

following retroactivity precedent.

13

something different.

14

took, wasn't it?

But the remedy is

That was exactly the line that she

15

MR. KERR:

That's correct.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And on your theory, I

17

mean, there's another question in this case; that is,

18

perhaps this evidence would come in under the inventory,

19

as a -- as a legitimate inventory search, and if the

20

Court decided that question, then -- then the question

21

you're arguing, the exclusionary rule question, would

22

have no practical consequences.

23

On your theory, the way you reasoned,

24

shouldn't the Court first decide was this a legitimate

25

inventory search, and if so, then we never get to any
10
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exclusionary rule question?
MR. KERR:

2

That issue, of course, has not

3

been briefed in this case.

4

Eleventh Circuit to apply that in the event the Court

5

reverses.

6

It would remain for the

At the same time, I wish to be clear that

7

I'm not arguing that the exclusionary rule is available

8

in every case when the Court overturns its precedent,

9

merely that it is a remedy in some cases, and I think

10
11

it's actually a necessary cost.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If I could just

12

follow up on Justice Ginsburg's question.

13

defendant have any incentive to bring his constitutional

14

claim if, as may or may not appear too likely, the

15

inventory search is going to result in the admission of

16

the evidence anyway?

17

Why did this

It seems that your theory goes too far in

18

saying that defendants will never have an incentive to

19

bring a constitutional challenge if there's some other

20

ground on which the evidence might be admitted, and

21

that's never been our law.

22

MR. KERR:

I agree that's never been the

23

Court's law, and I think there's an important

24

distinction to be made here.

25

an argument that has a remote chance of success, and

The distinction is between

11
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

defendants will make those claims, and arguments that

2

have no chance of success, which is no -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

3

Well, it's often -­

4

we do that.

We take cases where you can bring a

5

constitutional challenge or a different challenge all

6

the time, qualified immunity cases, you know, what was

7

the law and was it clearly established?

8

bring the qualified immunity cases all the time even if

9

they have a tough case on whether it's clearly

Defendants

10

established.

Harmless error cases, the underlying

11

violation, whether it's a harmless error, and the Court

12

can decide the case on either ground, but that doesn't

13

keep defendants from bringing the claims.

14

MR. KERR:

15

between a tough case and no case.

16

government's claim is the defendant would know any

17

effort to challenge this Court's precedent cannot

18

logically lead to any relief.

19

lose on the merits, if the Court upholds its precedent

20

or the defendant will lose under the good faith

21

exception.

22

But there's a big difference
The difficulty of the

So your incentive

argument really only holds up when the ground on the

alternative ground is hopeless?

MR. KERR:

chance of likelihood.

4

government's position, is that it -­

5

Hopeless meaning a zero percent
That's the difficulty of the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Kerr, let's say I'm

6

concerned about the kinds of issues that you're raise,

7

the incentives on defense counsel and also the oddity of

8

the Court deciding a case in which it's absolutely not

9

possible to grant a remedy.

Wouldn't the solution to

10

that be not the rule that you are advocating, but

11

instead a much more limited rule which said that in that

12

case the exclusionary rule applied, but not in any other

13

case, not in any case on direct appeal?

14

MR. KERR:

I think Justice Harlan's answer

15

to that is persuasive, that it's inconsistent with basic

16

norms of constitutional adjudication to treat the first

17

case differently from other cases not on -- other cases

18

on direct review.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess, Mr. Kerr, I'm not

20

sure that that's right.

Justice Harlan was talking

21

about constitutional rights at a period where, as the

22

Chief Justice said, the exclusionary rule was viewed as

23

part of the constitutional right.

24

doesn't view the exclusionary rule that way any more, if

25

it views the exclusionary rule as simply a prophylactic
13
Alderson Reporting Company

But if this Court

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

rule which gives a particular defendant a windfall in

2

order to gain systemic effects, systemic benefits, why

3

would we do it any more broadly than we would need to do

4

it?

5

point that this would very much change the incentives

6

for defense counsel.

7

kind of, I don't know, maybe inconsistent with Article

8

III to take a case in which there was absolutely no

9

chance of relief being granted, but we can deal with

And we would just say:

Look, we understand your

We understand your point that it's

10

those issues simply by saying that in your case you get

11

relief, but not in any other.

12

MR. KERR:

Justice Kagan, that was the

13

precise premise of the Linkletter regime.

14

the exclusionary rule as a judge-created remedy, the

15

idea of the exclusionary rule as not being a personal

16

right, that actually was the premise of Linkletter.

17

to go back to something that resembles that regime in

18

substance, even if with a new label.

19

advised in light of the history of the Linkletter era,

20

and the Court's struggles to try to articulate a

21

consistent standard that can treat the first case and

22

other cases similarly.

23

The idea of

So

I think is ill­

I think Desist was a Fourth Amendment case,

24

Peltier also a Fourth Amendment case, Peltier also a

25

Fourth Amendment case.

The government's proposal is
14

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

essentially a return to Peltier with a difference.

2

the Court wants to treat the first case differently than

3

later cases, it is essentially recreating Peltier.
JUSTICE ALITO:

4

If

With respect to the

5

incentives that you're talking about, is there really

6

much difference between what would apply in a case like

7

this and what already applies in cases that fall under

8

Krull?

9

authorizes a search under particular circumstances, as

Suppose Congress enacts a statute that

10

it did, as was the case in Almeida-Sanchez.

Now, under

11

Krull nobody is going to be able to, and no one who is

12

subjected to a search under that statute is going to be

13

able, to challenge, to obtain suppression, unless you

14

can say that a reasonable law enforcement officer

15

couldn't have thought that this statute which was

16

enacted by Congress and signed by the President was a

17

correct interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.
Now, maybe there'll be a few cases like

18
19

that, but in the great majority, the vast majority of

20

cases, the person will not be able to mount such a

21

challenge.

22

situation here and the situation that the Court already

23

approved in Krull?
MR. KERR:

24
25

So what is the difference between the

differences.

I think there are two

One is that there is a substantial
15
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

difference from the standpoint of a defendant or defense

2

attorney between a remote chance of success in a legal

3

claim and no chance of success on a legal claim.

4

leaves open the possibility -- and it may be remote, but

5

nonetheless a possibility -- of relief if the defendant

6

can persuade a court that a reasonable officer would

7

have known in light of this Court's precedent that the

8

statute allowed unconstitutional searches.
JUSTICE ALITO:

9

Krull

Well, we could leave that

10

open here.

11

immunity if a reasonable officer couldn't have believed

12

that a prior decision of this Court was a correct

13

interpretation of the Fourth Amendment.

14

sounds strange only because we have a higher opinion of

15

ourselves than we do of the Congress and the President.

16

We could say that there's no good faith

MR. KERR:

Maybe that

And yet I think your -- your

17

hypothetical, your suggestion that perhaps the Court

18

could adopt that standard, shows the difficulty of

19

trying to craft a good faith exception that ends up

20

running up against the Linkletter problem.

21

exactly the issue the Court struggled with during the

22

Linkletter era that Justice Harlan -­

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This is

Essentially, is your

24

argument essentially that we should distinguish never,

25

which would be this case if your position is not right,
16
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and hardly ever.

Is that -­

MR. KERR:

2

That's correct.

Where the rule

3

is never, defendants are unlikely to make any sort of

4

claim, and this Court would be denied the opportunity to

5

review its own precedents, and that's an essential role

6

of this Court's decisions in the Fourth Amendment

7

setting.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

8
9

Well, you might respond

that the government's going to say, well, there's Monell

10

that's in their brief, and you'll probably say that

11

that's a weak substitute for a criminal defense

12

attorney's doing it in the trial itself.
MR. KERR:

13

It is a weak substitute.

There's

14

been no case that I'm aware of at least involving

15

liability against a municipality seeking law reform.

16

It's because the Court has rejected the notion of

17

municipal liability as being based on respondeat

18

superior.

19

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Suppose we were concerned

20

with the costs of your rule in the sense that Gant does

21

have some exception for the safety of the officers, and

22

I think you can read the case if there's some general

23

safety considerations for not securing the car in a

24

neighborhood rather than leave it by itself.

25

adopted your rule, the prosecution in all those cases
17
Alderson Reporting Company

If we

Official - Subject to Final Review

would not have had the opportunity to make those

2

additional defenses or those -- to advance those

3

additional justifications for the search.

4

say, well, I'm just trying to resurrect Linkletter.
MR. KERR:

5

I disagree.

Maybe you'll

Just to explain,

6

Justice Kennedy, my rule would be to retain the existing

7

practice of this Court.

8

the practice of this Court, and that is when the Court

9

recognized the need to overturn Belton or at least to

I'm suggesting no changes in

substantially change Belton in the Gant case, the Court,

11

Justice Alito in his dissent, recognized that there were

12

costs along with that and that led to review of cases in

13

the lower courts.

14

decisions, the lower courts held that the searches were

15

nonetheless constitutional under Gant, and that was

16

absolutely proper.

MR. KERR:

Well, those cases were

In the closed cases, I'm not in

22

any way challenging the traditional rule of Teague v.

23

Layne and Stone v. Powell that the new rule is not

is closed and no defendant can seek review.

As soon as the conviction is final, the door

18
Alderson Reporting Company

This is

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

only about direct review and the initial case in which

2

the rule is announced, and that's why I think it raises

3

a special set of jurisprudential problems because it

4

implicates this Court's need to avoid advisory opinions

5

and to avoid what would amount to a one-way street.

6

Under the government's proposed rules, proposed rule,

7

defendants would have a limited ability to challenge

8

precedents that construe the Fourth Amendment too

9

narrowly, but of course of government would be free in

10

any case to challenge precedents that the government

11

believes construes the Fourth Amendment too broadly.

12

The concern is that over time that would lead to an

13

asymmetry in the Court's outcomes, not as a result of

14

the measured judgments of this Court, but rather as a

15

result of the incentives on counsel, and the Court

16

should strive to avoid that sort of result.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18

an exception to our general approach, assuming the

19

general approach is not the one you succeed, for, as you

20

put it, cases where there's zero possibility of success,

21

while allowing application of the good faith precedent,

22

even if the chances of success are remote.

23

Is it really worth the candle to have

24

litigation over whether it was a difference between zero

25

chance and remote chance, as opposed to continuing to
19

2

apply the good faith rule across the board?
MR. KERR:

Just to be clear, the Court has

3

not applied the good faith exception in this setting.

4

The government is arguing for an expansion of the good

5

faith exception into territory which has traditionally

6

been thought to be the regime of retroactivity.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understand your

8

position on that.

Now, getting to my question, is it

9

really worth it for us to have litigation over the

10

difference between zero and remote in determining what

11

rule we should apply in this case?

12

MR. KERR:

I don't foresee litigation on

13

that point because, at least as I understand the

14

government's rule, as soon as a defendant utters the

15

phrase "This court should overturn its precedent," then

16

the good faith exception would automatically apply.

17

That's at least how I understand the government's

18

proposed rule.

19

exactly what the standard would be, but if the standard

20

is broad enough such that upon asking for -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

here's why our case is different.

argument has zero chance or only a remote chance.
MR. KERR:

In that circumstance I think the

3

Court would be forced with issuing what -- forced to

4

issue what may amount to an advisory opinion.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it seems to

6

me -- I mean, in terms of the incentives on the defense

7

counsel, it would be an odd defense lawyer who is going

8

to say you should consider argument A because my second

9

argument has got zero chance of succeeding.

10

MR. KERR:

I think the incentive on defense

11

counsel, if the government's rule is adopted, is to

12

never argue that cases should be overturned, and instead

13

make not terribly candid arguments to this Court that

14

every case is distinguishable.

15

JUSTICE SCALIA:

Mr. Kerr, I've been on the

18

The facts

Katz v. United States is perhaps

22

a case worth focusing on, where the Court overturned the

23

rule of Goldman and Olmstead that wiretapping does not

24

implicate the Fourth Amendment.

25

Court argued that the Goldman-Olmstead regime had -- was

Katz's brief to this

the Goldman-Olmstead regime.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

There was no attempt

18

(Laughter.)

19

MR. KERR:

Nonetheless, the incentive on

20

counsel under the government's rule would be not to ever

21

make the claim that a precedent should be overturned.

22

And the Court needs that argument to be made in

23

appropriate cases so the Court can enter decisions and

24

consider the balance of the considerations

25

appropriately.

It has done so under the current
22
Alderson Reporting Company

1

practice, and that is really as a result of Griffith v.

2

Kentucky, which applies not only -- allows the

3

exclusionary rule to be available in the first case, but

in other cases on direct review.
If there are no further questions, I would

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10

MR. DREEBEN:

11
12

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Because the exclusionary rule has severe

13
14

consequences for the truth-seeking function of a

15

criminal trial, this Court has restricted its

16

application to those situations in which it's necessary

17

to further the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary

18

rule, namely to shape police conduct.
The Court has repeatedly rejected efforts to

19
20

expand the exclusionary rule to serve other purposes,

21

such as schooling judges who issue warrants on the need

22

to respect the Fourth Amendment, reminding legislatures

23

about their obligations under the Fourth Amendment, and

24

for other purposes such as to preserve judicial

25

integrity.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Dreeben, what about

2

Gant itself?

Gant severely qualified Belton.

3

there have been a suppression remedy for Gant, as

4

Justice Kagan suggested, the very case that changes the

5

law?
MR. DREEBEN:

6

Should

Justice Ginsburg, let me give

7

two responses to that.

First of all, the rule that the

8

Eleventh Circuit adopted in this case, and that is the

9

only rule before the Court, involves a situation in

10

which there is binding appellant precedent that

11

instructs the officer, tells the officer, what you're

12

about to do complies with the Fourth Amendment.

13

The state of the law in Arizona would not

14

necessarily have risen to that level, in light of the

15

dissonance in that court's opinions, in the Arizona

16

Supreme Court opinions, about the reach and scope of

17

Belton.
So the question about whether the rule that

18
19

we're urging here would have applied in Arizona is a

20

separate question from the one that the Eleventh Circuit

21

resolved.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

22
23

it?

24

the exclusionary rule?

25

And how would you answer

Was Gant purely prospective or did Gant itself get

MR. DREEBEN:

Gant obtained relief.
24

Alderson Reporting Company

This

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Court granted certiorari in Gant limited to the Fourth

2

Amendment question, and Arizona never raised any good

3

faith exception to the exclusionary rule in that case,

4

so the Court did not address the good faith issue.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5
6

Suppose -- suppose it had

been raised?
MR. DREEBEN:

7

The logic of our position

8

would be that, to the extent that Gant was seeking

9

Belton to be overruled, he would not be able to impugn

10

the actions of the officers who relied on it.

11

extent that he was doing what he actually did do and

12

which this Court's opinion in Gant accepted, which is to

13

say that the Gant opinion, that the Belton opinion did

14

not resolve the fact pattern in Gant, he would not be

15

automatically governed by the good faith exception.

16

as a result, Gant is really the best illustration of how

17

unusual it is for a lawyer to come to this Court and

18

say, please outright overrule a Fourth Amendment

19

decision.

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

To the

And

Mr. Dreeben, do you think

21

that if a lawyer did that, if a lawyer filed a cert

22

petition and said you should overturn the following

23

Fourth Amendment precedent, and that was all that was in

24

the cert petition, would we be able to grant that cert

25

petition knowing that there was no possibility of relief
25
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

for that petitioner?
MR. DREEBEN:

2

Yes, Justice Kagan, I believe

3

the Court could grant that petition, although it's

4

highly likely that any criminal defendant who filed it

5

would couple it with a claim that this Court should

6

either reverse, modify, or limit any holding that came

7

out.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you think that we would

have appropriate Article III authority to decide that

10

question without any hope of relief?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Certainly the Court would have

12

Article III authority, because it's always free to

13

limit, modify or abrogate one of its precedents,

14

including a holding, if one issued from this decision,

15

that the good faith rule applies when the Court

16

overrules its decision.

17

Litigants can all the time be faced with

18

impossible arguments under existing precedent, but that

19

doesn't preclude this Court's Article III jurisdiction

20

to adjudicate challenges to that precedent.

21

indeed the very premise of Petitioner's argument.

22

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's

I assume if Petitioner says

23

we should be able to overrule our prior substantive

24

precedent, he should also logically say that we should

25

be able to overrule our prior precedent regarding the
26
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

exclusionary rule.

So that whenever somebody wants to

2

come up here to challenge prior precedent, he can just

3

say:

4

overrule two cases:

5

of Fourth Amendment law; and secondly, whether that -­

6

that change in law can govern the action of the

7

policeman who didn't realize that the law was going to

8

be changed.

The first one, the substantive rule

That's correct, Justice

10

Scalia, and I think it illustrates why there is no

Article III impediment.

12

prudentially be reluctant to take a case in which it

13

knows that its resolution of the Fourth Amendment issue

14

would not dictate a reversal of the judgment, even if

15

the Fourth Amendment issue went in favor of the

16

defendant, but it is not that dissimilar from the

17

situation in qualified immunity, when there is no law on

18

the books that governs an issue and a petitioner asks

19

the Court to resolve the Fourth Amendment issue.

Now, this Court may

JUSTICE SCALIA:

20

And if he asks for the

21

double overruling that I just suggested, I guess there's

22

some chance that the Court would do it?

24
25

It would be remote, but not

zero.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You've just raised the

2

question of qualified immunity and the similarities.

3

There is one problem that I have with the regime that

4

you are suggesting, which is that because laws differ

5

among circuits, now we've created a regime where we say

6

if the law was clear or if there was law on this issue

7

in your circuit, and the police officer relied on it,

8

the exclusionary rule won't apply; but if the law was

9

uncertain or not clear in another circuit, then the

10

exclusionary rule does apply.
There's something illogical about permitting

11
12

that kind of difference to control the outcome of

13

suppression.

14

get in a qualified immunity thing?

15

officer has a reasonable cause to believe their conduct

16

didn't violate the Constitution, then no suppression?

So there's no value in

That's true, but that's a

direct consequence of the logic of the good faith

informed this Court's retroactivity jurisprudence in the

9

Peltier decision were taken out of the law of

10

retroactivity when the Court decided Griffith v.

Kentucky; but those same considerations became relevant

12

to the good faith exception, which is tied to the

question of whether there is a need to deter police

misconduct because the police have disregarded the

governing law.

Alderson Reporting Company

The

reason that's simple is that's what we've always done.

2

And somebody says let's make an exception here, bring in

the exception, good faith, and we say no.

because any of the policy arguments are wrong, but just

MR. DREEBEN:

The principle is very

straightforward.

rule applies only when it can deter police misconduct.

22

When police rely on a warrant issued by a magistrate, a

23

statute or a judicial decision issued by a court of

appeals that governs their conduct, they are not making

25

a decision about what the Fourth Amendment requires.

They are following a different actor in the system, and

this Court has held that there is no deterrent value to

suppress evidence with an important cost to the

5

question is, when there's a circuit split, why are we,

as Justice Kennedy is saying, giving protection to the

circuit that's plain wrong and to the officer who chose

to follow that advice?

MR. DREEBEN:

So I guess my

expect police officers to attempt to define the content

of the Fourth Amendment on their own.

12

recipients of the status of the law from the courts that

13

govern their activities; training programs will be

instituted based on that law.

training programs will advise officers that there may be

some legal risk if there's a circuit split, and that a

decision may ultimately be reversed; but we don't expect

question, because some members of the Court have

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

From as best as I can tell, this Court has

2

not overruled one of its Fourth Amendment precedents in

3

a manner that favored defendants' interests since 1969.

4

Despite whatever incentives may have existed as a result

5

of the exclusionary rule, defendants will typically

6

understand that stare decisis is the normal course that

7

this Court follows, and as a result, they are highly

likely to structure their arguments in a manner that

will seek to distinguish, limit, or undermine a

overruling.
JUSTICE ALITO:

of that, what is wrong with the suggestion that Justice

decisions and thereby to receive a benefit when they do

3

so.

4

actually succeeds in that endeavor, it would limit the

5

costs of the exclusionary rule, which, after all, result

6

in the exclusion of reliable probative evidence of guilt

7

in every case where it's applied.
And the Court could tailor the exclusionary

8
9

If it's limited to the first individual who

rule in that manner.

If it did so, it would certainly

10

minimize the costs, and it would represent the least

11

amount of intrusion on the purposes of the exclusionary

12

rule.

13

If the Court were to adopt another purpose for the

14

exclusionary rule, namely creating incentives for

15

counsel to challenge existing precedent, that will

16

represent a substantial departure from this Court's

17

consistent holdings that the only function of the

18

exclusionary rule is to deter police misconduct, and

19

once the Court has acknowledged that an additional

20

exception to the exclusionary rule is justified, even if

21

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Breyer, it hasn't

One is it's

4

extraordinarily rare for this Court to overrule its own

5

Fourth Amendment precedent.

6

rare, or almost equally rare, for the courts of appeals

7

to overrule their precedent and adopt a more

8

defendant-friendly Fourth Amendment rule.

It's apparently equally

9

I cannot claim to have done an exhaustive

10

survey of all of the courts of appeals decisions that

11

possibly overruled Fourth Amendment holdings, but the

12

results of my research disclose only one case in which a

13

court of appeals overruled its precedent to favor a

14

defendant, and that occurred in 1987 in the Fifth

15

Circuit, and the Fifth Circuit adopted a good faith

16

exception precisely like the one that the government is

17

urging the court to adopt today and declined to suppress

18

the evidence for that reason.

19

apparently confronted the question of whether overruling

20

a decision triggers the good faith exception.
JUSTICE BREYER:

And I think, as Justice Ginsburg pointed

19

out, in Judge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh

21

22

next question is an entirely separate issue of remedy,

23

and that remedy issue is governed by this Court's good

faith precedents.

today, holdings that overrule Fourth Amendment decisions

4

5

often.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

6

Were we right that -­

7

there were several cases that were TBR'd in light of

8

Gant.

9

under your theory.

Maybe some of them shouldn't have been TBR'd

MR. DREEBEN:

10

Well, Justice Ginsburg, before

11

the litigation that occurred in the wake of Gant, there

12

was only one precedent on the books in any circuit that

13

I'm aware of that had applied the -- in the Federal

14

system -- that had applied a good faith rule to overrule

15

judicial decisions.

16

in the Fifth Circuit.

17

Circuit's opinion in this case.

That was United States v. Jackson
It's cited in the Eleventh
It happened in 1987.

So I think it's fair to say that prosecutors

18
19

and government officials were not raising good faith

20

exclusionary rule arguments in the cases that were held

21

for Gant.

22

done so, and as a result, it was perfectly logical and

23

in accordance with this Court's normal practice to

24

grant, vacate, and remand those cases for further

25

consideration under Gant.

I don't believe that the United States had

41
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

But in the wake of Gant, courts began to

2

think of the logic of Leon and Krull and this Court's

3

recent decision in Herring v. United States and attempt

4

to apply the logic of those decisions to a circumstance

5

in which a police officer relies on a binding and

6

governing appellate precedent, and they concluded that

7

courts that announce precedents have every reason to

8

expect that litigants will rely on them and that police

9

officers will rely on them.

Therefore, there is no

10

deterrent purpose to be served by suppressing the

11

evidence.

It's all cost.
And the cost would be that individuals whose

12
13

convictions have been obtained based on evidence that

14

was seized in reasonable good faith reliance on existing

15

appellate precedent will now be able to overturn their

16

convictions, and that's a heavy cost to the

17

administration of justice.

18

rule has been confined to particularized circumstances

19

where it's thought that it will actually achieve a

20

benefit, and it has not been expanded beyond those

21

purposes.

22

It's why the exclusionary

So given that litigants, criminal

23

defendants, have a tremendous incentive to challenge

24

their convictions and to try to navigate around

25

precedents while simultaneously showing that those
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

precedents may have underlying material flaws, this

2

Court is highly unlikely to be deprived of cases in

3

which litigants attempt to undermine precedents without

4

actually calling for their overruling.

5

happened, for example, in Batson v. Kentucky, where the

6

Petitioner in that case did not want to head-on confront

7

Swain v. Alabama and ask for its overruling, and as a

8

result asserted that racially discriminatory peremptory

9

challenges were invalid under the Sixth Amendment,

That is what

10

rather than the Equal Protection Clause.

This Court got

11

the case and concluded that the proper analysis was the

12

Equal Protection Clause and it accordingly overruled

13

Swain in relevant part.

14

So it's highly unlikely that if, in fact, a

15

precedent of this Court is beginning to fray around the

16

edges and justices of this Court have written

17

concurrences or dissents that explain that they no

18

longer believe that the logic of that is sound,

19

litigants will exploit those statements in an effort to

20

narrow the precedent and ultimately expose its flaws, so

21

that if this Court determines it can overrule the

22

precedent, and it can do so even if the exclusionary

23

remedy will not follow.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would the rule that you're

arguing for apply only in the situation where there is a
43
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

binding precedent that affirmatively approves a

2

particular police practice, or would it also apply in

3

the situation in which there is simply absolutely

4

nothing on the books that prohibits the police practice,

5

so that a reasonable officer wouldn't have any reason to

6

think that the practice was unconstitutional?
MR. DREEBEN:

7

This case, Justice Alito, only

8

involves the example of binding appellate precedent, and

9

Judge Kravitch's opinion for the Eleventh Circuit

10

distinguished between the two situations.

11

situation in which there is no precedent, such that an

12

officer would not be instructed that his conduct is

13

affirmatively unconstitutional, qualified immunity

14

applies, and there would be arguments that there is

15

nothing to deter if an officer acts within that empty

16

space.

17

In the

But there is a countervailing argument, and

18

the countervailing argument, which Judge Kravitch talked

19

about in the Eleventh Circuit, opinion, would be that

20

when there's no law on the books courts should give

21

officers to -- an incentive to act in favor of the more

22

constitutionally protective manner, rather than taking a

23

flier on what might turn out to be unconstitutional.

24
25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

She did say that if there

is ambiguity, then the police must err on the side of

accept that?

Do you think that that's -- do you

MR. DREEBEN:

3

No, Justice Ginsburg, I would

4

not submit to the Court that the United States

5

necessarily agrees with that.

6

doesn't involve that problem and, as I said, there are

7

contrary arguments that could be advanced based on this

8

Court's description in Herring of the purpose of the

9

exclusionary rule to reach conduct that is either

I think that this case

10

reckless or intentional or at the least systematically

11

negligent.

12

And, so, some day this Court may have to

13

confront whether the narrow limitation that Judge

14

Kravitch adapted -- adopted in her opinion is the

15

correct rule of law versus a broader view that exclusion

16

is only appropriate when the officers have engaged in

17

truly culpable conduct.

the Court needs to cross in this case.

affirmance of the judgment.

It's not an

This judgment can be affirmed simply by

22

holding that the syllogism that the court of appeals

23

adopted that, absent a deterrent purpose there is no

24

basis for exclusion, there is no deterrent purpose here,

25

that's sufficient to resolve this case and the Court can

proposition, whether the exclusionary rule should have

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ORIN S. KERR

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. KERR:

Thank you.

11

I would like to start with the costs -- or

12

return to the costs here of the exclusionary rule.

13

First, the plain error doctrine is going to largely

14

address the concerns that the government has in this

15

case.

16

the exclusionary rule when the Court overturns

17

precedents under the plain error doctrine, if defendants

18

don't raise a challenge to the search or seizure in

19

their case there will be no relief available to them.

If this Court is seeking to limit the scope of

So therefore, the only possible relief that

21

could be granted is for individuals that saw the issue,

22

raised the issue, and that will, of course, include the

23

individual who raises the claim in a case where the

24

Court overturns its precedent, therefore avoiding any of

25

the difficulties similar to that of retroactivity.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

In -- in -- in one -- in

2

one sense if we're talking about costs, the rule the

3

government proposes is -- is defendant friendly, in that

4

this Court may be more willing to impose stricter rules

5

under the Fourth Amendment, if it knows that the good

faith rule will protect against the -- the costs of -­

of overturning the conviction.
MR. KERR:

Kennedy.

That's exactly right, Justice

And, in fact, that exact argument was one of

the reasons Justice Harlan concluded that the

Justice

16

Alito's dissent nicely points out the very real costs of

17

the shift from the Belton rule to the Gant rule, and if

18

there were no costs in a regime of pure prospectivity,

19

the Court would feel much more free to overturn its

20

precedents because no one would actually be affected by

21

the rule of any cases that are either on direct review

22

or in the initial case or of those individuals whose

23

convictions are already final.

JUSTICE KENNEDY:

MR. KERR:

2

That works to the benefit of

3

defendants as a class, absolutely.

as one of the benefits of Linkletter, that it freed the

It is necessary for Fourth

And so I think that the costs of the exclusionary rule

11

in that setting are actually necessary costs.
And I also think concerns of a windfall that

12

are available to defendants are overstated because of

14

the many doctrines that limit the scope of the

15

exclusionary rule such as inevitable discovery or

16

standing.

you read the Desist dissent, in particular Justice

11

Harlan's dissent, it's clear that he's considering the

12

issue of retroactivity to be about the scope of the

13

exclusionary rule.
The Eleventh Circuit below had this idea

14
15

that retroactivity is about the availability of a rule,

16

but rules are not sort of ephemeral ideas that are

17

available or not without any impact.

they are available, they are available independently of
