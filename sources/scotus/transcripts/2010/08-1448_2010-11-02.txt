Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Association.

Mr. Morazzini.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MORAZZINI:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

11

The California law at issue today before

12

this Court differs from the New York law at issue in

13

Ginsberg in only one respect:

14

concerned with minors' access to harmful sexual material

15

outside the guidance of a parent, California is no less

16

concerned with a minor's access to the deviant level of

17

violence that is presented in a certain category of

18

video games that can be no less harmful to the

19

development of minors.

20

Where New York was

When this Court in Ginsberg crafted a rule

21

of law that permits States to regulate a minor's access

22

to such material outside the presence of a parent, it

23

did so for two fundamental reasons that are equally

24

applicable this morning in this case.

25

First, this rule permits parents' claim to
3
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

authority in their own household to direct the

2

upbringing and the development of their children; and,

3

secondly, this rule promotes the States' independent

4

interest in helping parents protect the well-being of

5

children in those instances when parents cannot be

6

present.
So this morning, California asks this Court

7
8

to adopt a rule of law that permits States to restrict

9

minors' ability to purchase deviant, violent video games

10

that the legislature has determined can be harmful to

11

the development and the upbringing -­

Grimms' fairy tales?

Why are video games special?

What

Or does your

10

principle extend to all deviant, violent materials in

MR. MORAZZINI:

No, Your Honor.

That's why

13

I believe California incorporated the three prongs of

14

the Miller standard.

It's not just patently offensive violence.

Why just video

MR. MORAZZINI:

Sure, Your Honor.

The

22

California Legislature was presented with substantial

23

evidence that demonstrates that the interactive nature

24

of violent -- of violent video games where the minor or

25

the young adult is the aggressor, is the -- is the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, do you actually have

studies that show that video games are more harmful to

minors than movies are?

7

MR. MORAZZINI:

Well, in the record, Your

8

Honor, I believe it's the Gentile and Gentile study

9

regarding violent video games as exemplary teachers.

10

The authors there note that video games are not only

11

exemplary teachers of pro-social activities, but also

12

exemplary teachers of aggression, which was the

13

fundamental concern of the California Legislature in

14

enacting this statute.

15

So, while the science is continually

16

developing -- indeed, it appears that studies are being

17

released every month regarding -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What was the -­

And suppose -- suppose a new

20

study suggested that movies were just as violent.

21

presumably, California could regulate movies just as it

22

could regulate video games.

23

MR. MORAZZINI:

Then,

Well, Your Honor, there is

24

scientific literature out there regarding the impact of

25

violent media on -- on children.

In fact, for decades,

6
Alderson Reporting Company

the President, Congress, the FTC, parenting groups have

2

been uniquely concerned with the level of violent media

available to minors that they have ready access to.

I don't know -- is that

the same for a Bugs Bunny episode as it is for a violent

video.

study, say we can outlaw Bugs Bunny?

was what counts as deviant violence or morbid violence?

only thing that I found was -- you said was clearly

covered by this statute was Postal 2.

the statute applies to more than one video game.

Okay, Justice Kagan, I would

16

go back to the language of the statute, and the statute

covers video games where the range of options available

to the player includes maiming, killing, dismembering,

torturing, sexually assaulting, and those types of

violence.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL M. SMITH

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

8
9
10

MR. SMITH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The California law at issue restricts the

11

distribution of expressive works based on their content.

12

California, as we've heard today, does not seriously

13

contend that it can satisfy the usual First Amendment

14

standards that apply to such a law.

15

asking this Court to grant it a new free pass, a

16

brand-new Ginsberg-like exception to the First Amendment

17

that would deny constitutional protection to some

18

ill-defined subset of expressive works and, I submit,

19

not just video games, but necessarily movies, books, and

20

any other expressive work that describes or portrays

21

violence in a way that some court somewhere, some day,

22

would decide is deviant and offensive.

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Instead, it's

What about -- the

24

distinction between books and movies may be that, in

25

these video games, the child is not sitting there
26

passively watching something; the child is doing the

2

killing.

3

that might be understood to have a different impact on

4

the child's moral development.

The child is doing the maiming.

evidence to suggest it's true.

What was -- what was

10

the state of the record that was present before the

Court in Ginsberg?
MR. SMITH:

12

The state of the record was that

they were aware of science on both sides, but made a

14

judgment that as a matter of common sense, they could

15

decide that obscenity, even somewhat at-large

16

obscenity -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17
18

So the Court acted

on the basis of common sense?
MR. SMITH:

19

Yes.

It said as long as there's

20

science on both sides, but in that particular area,

21

which is an exception based -- that goes back to the

22

founding, they felt that it was -- it was proper for

23

them to adjust the outer boundaries of the exception.

particular material before the Court.

is this somewhat larger a definition of variable

obscenity going to be acceptable to -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

They simply said,

Talking about common sense,

14

why isn't it common sense to say that if a parent wants

15

his 13-year-old child to have a game where the child is

16

going to sit there and imagine he's a torturer and

17

impose gratuitous, painful, excruciating, torturing

18

violence upon small children and women, and do this for

19

an hour or so, and there is no social or redeeming

20

value, it's not artistic, it's not literary, et

21

cetera -- why isn't it common sense to say a State has

22

the right to say, parent, if you want that for your

23

13-year-old, you go buy it yourself.

24

what they're saying.

MR. SMITH:

Which I think is

Well, Your Honor, the State has
28

to have some reason to think that parents -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

It does, it does.

What it

3

has is -- and I've looked at the studies, perhaps not as

thoroughly as you, but it seemed to me that Dr. Ferguson

5

and Dr. Anderson are in a disagreement.

6

that much of a disagreement actually, but they've looked

in depth at a whole lot of video games, not movies

8

they're talking about or other things; they're talking

9

about video games.

hurt children.

I have to admit that if I'm supposed to be a

sociological expert, I can't choose between them.

18

if I can say could a legislature have enough evidence to

19

think there's harm, the answer is yes.

20

MR. SMITH:

But

There is two aspects of harm.

21

The one I was about to address was the question of

22

whether parents need additional help in exercising the

23

role that they have played throughout the history -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

They need additional

help because many parents are not home when their

Alderson Reporting Company

1

children come home from school.

I -- we hope.

3

are there, they do what they want.

4

is, if you want that gratuitous torture of, let's say

5

babies, to make it as bad as possible, what you do,

6

parent, is you go buy it; don't let him buy it on his

7

own, and he's 13 years old.

8

sense or what's the science of that?

9

Many parents have jobs,

And -- and when -- when their children

MR. SMITH:

And all this says

Now, what's the common

Well, two aspects.

With respect

10

to parental controls, Your Honor, there's a whole

11

variety -- a whole series of things that parents have

12

available to them and are using today to deal with any

13

concerns that they have about what's appropriate for

14

their children.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't want to

16

interrupt your answer, but any 13-year-old can bypass

17

parental controls in about 5 minutes.

18

MR. SMITH:

That is one element of about

19

five different elements, Your Honor.

talk about them -- there is the ratings.

21

MR. SMITH:

mediums coming along and people vastly overreacting to

them, thinking the sky is falling, our children are all

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Smith, do you think all

video games are speech in the first instance?

Because

3

you could look at these games and say they're the

4

modern-day equivalent of Monopoly sets.

5

They're things that people use to compete.

6

when you think about some of them -- the first video

7

game was Pong.

8

is that speech at all?

9

MR. SMITH:

They're games.
You know,

It was playing tennis on your TV.

How

The games that we are talking

10

about have narrative, events that are occurring,

11

characters, plot.

12

set out to regulate here.

13

here -- there is violence, one person is hurting another

14

person -- it has to be a human being who's the victim -­

15

and it's doing it in a -- in a way that they find

16

offensive in some way, we're going to regulate it.

obviously, what -­

So,

So are we going to separate

video games into narrative video games and non-narrative

20

video games?

MR. SMITH:

You don't have to, as long as

22

the law is limited to regulating narrative.

That's what

23

this law is limited to.

shouldn't buy -- play games that have red images that

appear in them, or something else that was somehow

What

14

the law would be directed at is not the plot, not the

video game itself, but the child's act of -- of

16

committing murder, maiming, and so forth.

17

MR. SMITH:

Well, the events in a video game

18

are -- what happens in the plot is a combination of what

19

the game gives you and what the player adds to it.

20

There's a -- there's a creative aspect coming at it from

the other side.

between the player and the game.

both are completely protected by the First Amendment.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

whether you use the Salerno test or the Glucksberg test,

if there is either one or any applications that would

satisfy the Constitution, the facial challenge fails.

Very clear under the law of this

Court that those tests don't apply in a First Amendment

context if the -- the -­

21

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought we

22

referenced them last year in the Stevens case, and the

23

only reason we didn't have to decide which applies is

24

because we adopted an approach that looked at

25

overbreadth and said this statute is overbroad and
41
Alderson Reporting Company

specifically didn't decide whether it could be applied

in that case to -- to crush videos.

3

MR. SMITH:

Well, that's -- that's correct,

4

Your Honor, but I think it's -- there's no argument

5

here, I don't think, that if you can find one game out

6

there to which this can constitutionally be applied,

7

even though it would also be unconstitutionally applied

8

under the vast run of other cases -­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I

10

understood -- the tenor of much of the questioning, I

11

think, is that there may be games and may be minors -­

12

maybe a less violent game sold to a 17-year-old, perhaps

13

that violates the First Amendment, but something like

14

Postal 2 sold to a 10-year-old might -- might well not

15

violate the First Amendment to apply this law to that.

16

MR. SMITH:

Well, that may be -­

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the way we

18

approached the issue in Stevens, where we had hunting

19

videos and crush videos, would say that it's too broad

20

to apply the law to everything, so we strike it down,

21

it's overbroad, but leave open the possibility that a

22

more narrowly drawn statute might pass muster.

23

Why -- why isn't that a good approach here?

24

MR. SMITH:

25

You certainly could do that.

Certainly, the key thing is that you strike down this
42
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

law, because this law is clearly much broader than any

2

one game.

3

no way, in fact, anybody is going to be able to come

4

back and draw a statute that gets to what they claim,

5

because the English language is not susceptible of that

level of precision.

I would submit to you, though, that there's

22

than the simple girlie magazine that was involved there.

that is to say, there is speech at issue, that speech is

being limited, it is being done for a good reason,

line.

that there's such a thing as morbid violence which could

be eliminated from ordinary movies.

history is helpful here.

1

doing for sex, except we don't think we ought to do it;

2

we think Congress should do it?

3

MR. SMITH:

What they did was they spent

4

several years trying to come up with a definition that

5

would allow anybody to figure out which violent TV shows

6

have to be put into this adult category and which don't,

7

and they eventually punted and said we have no idea how

8

to do that; Congress asked us to do it; we cannot do it;

9

and they punted it back to Congress to try to come up

10

with a definition.

11

This is a very difficult task, trying to use

12

language to differentiate levels of violence or types of

13

violence in a manner that would in some way tell people

14

what the rules of the game are.

15

think that there's some problem out there that needs to

16

be solved, you ought to think very carefully about

17

whether or not you're going to authorize the creation of

18

some new rule authorizing regulation in this area, when

19

no one will have any idea what the scope of it is.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think, even if you

And you say there's no

21

problem because 16-year-olds in California never have

22

$50 available to go buy a video game and because they

23

never have TVs in their room, and their parents are

24

always home watching what they -- they do with their

25

video games, and the parents -- and the video games have
53
Alderson Reporting Company

Official

1

features that allow parents to block access, to block

2

the playing of violent video games, which can't be

3

overcome by a computer-savvy California 16-year-old;

4

that's why there's no problem, right?
MR. SMITH:

5

I guess, if what we're really

6

going to do is judge the constitutionality of this law

7

based on what 16- and 17-year-olds are getting and

8

whether that would be harmful to them, I think the

9

problem there is the line between 16 and 17 and 18 is so

10

fine, that you're not going to be able to identify any

11

real category of games that fits into that category.

12

And it's important, by the way, to -- to

13

note that California hasn't told us whether we should

14

judge it for 5-year-olds, 10-year-olds, 17-year-olds.

15

If it's 5-year-olds, then it's vastly over-restrictive;

16

if it's 17-year-olds, I suspect -- I suspect it wouldn't

17

restrict anything because nobody is going to be able to

18

convince a -- jury, well, this is an 18-year-old game,

19

not a 17-year-old game.

20

We draw that kind of

21

line of course in the death penalty area, don't we?

MR. SMITH:

4

But here you're assessing works

5

of expression and trying to decide what age they -- they

6

would correspond to, and I don't think you can cut it

7

that finely and say, well, this is an 18 game; this is

8

only a 17 game.

9

that's the test, the test Justice Breyer suggested it

I just don't think that works.

So if

10

ought to be, then the statute essentially would restrict

11

nothing.

And as you experimented

with other things, as they did in the obscenity area,

you could discover you could limit it to that.

20

MR. SMITH:

I think the "maybe" is telling,

21

though, Your Honor.

Somebody, as Justice Scalia pointed

22

out, in publishing a game has to know what -- what to -­

what the rules of the game are in advance, subject to

24

hundreds of millions of dollars of penalties.

5

prosecuted for a different one.

Your rules.

The X things would be limited to

MR. SMITH:

And you might never.

Our rules wouldn't help you at

all.

They say that -- that -- they're only restricting

8

a smaller number, a small subset of M-rated games,

9

which, by the way, we say are appropriate for

10

17-year-olds.

So you have -- these ratings that the

11

State wants us to impose are going to conflict with the

12

ratings that are already on the packaging which are

13

being used by parents every day to make these judgments.

14

So it's actually interfering -- the prospect of it would

15

interfere with the information already on the packaging.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ZACKERY P. MORAZZINI
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. MORAZZINI:

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice.
I wanted to address one point that has been
raised about minors' ability to access these games.

Yes, new games do cost $60, but California's law also

2

regulates the rental of these video games, which is just

3

a few dollars per game.

4

them and can access them.

5

So minors certainly can afford

But I also wanted to draw out the point that

6

California's law really is not an ordinance that's

7

directed to a plot of a game.

8

to games with essentially no plot, no artistic value.

9

This is the helpful nature of the third prong of the

It's expressly directed

11

nature of the game where the child is acting out -­

12

So it really is only going after the

14

test for artistic value?

MR. MORAZZINI:

So long as

No, if the -- if the level

7

of the violence -- just as in obscenity, if the level of

8

the violence causes the game as a whole to lack the

artistic -- it's -- it's a balance, Your Honor, just as

10

right here in open court that the video game Postal 2,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would a video game that

18

portrayed a Vulcan, as opposed to a human being, being

19

maimed and tortured -- would that be covered by the Act?

20

MR. MORAZZINI:

No, it wouldn't, Your Honor,

21

because the Act is only directed towards the range of

22

options that are able to be inflicted on a human being.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

reasons that sex and violence are so similar.
