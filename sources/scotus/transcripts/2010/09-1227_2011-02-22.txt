ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

8

MR. CLEMENT:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The standing of Petitioner to challenge the

11
12

constitutionality of the Federal statute under which her

13

liberty is being deprived should not be open to serious

14

question.

15

tripartite test for standing.

16

imagine an injury more particularized or concrete than

17

six years in Federal prison, and the liberty interest

18

she seeks to vindicate is her own, not some third

19

party's.

She clearly satisfies this Court's modern
Indeed, it is hard to

that is the basis for the prosecution.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

Do our -- any of our

3

opinions talk about the standing of the defendant?

4

can't think of one at the moment.

5

MR. CLEMENT:

I

Well, I think it was in the

6

habeas context, but the Spencer decision does talk about

7

how, when you have a criminal defendant or somebody who

8

is serving a sentence, their standing to challenge the

9

conviction is essentially one of the easiest standing

10

cases you can imagine.

And I think in a sense, the same

11

principles would apply here.

12

But as I said, I think standing is normally

13

something you think about as applying to the plaintiff,

14

who is invoking the jurisdiction of the court.

15

what's really at issue here is something -- almost more

16

of a bar on somebody's ability to make an argument that

17

would vindicate their liberty, and I see no reason why,

18

in logic, that should be the case.

19

apply ordinary -­
JUSTICE SCALIA:

Well, it seems to me there

22

are certainly some arguments you could make as a

23

defendant for which you have no standing.

25

which you have no standing?

4

have no business having anything to do with your case.

5

6

to do with -- would be non-justiciable -­

Suppose I raise an

8

Establishment Clause objection in a matter that -- that

9

does not involve legislation and which our recent

10

opinions say therefore does not violate the

11

Establishment Clause?

12

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, I guess I would have to

13

know why you were a defendant in that case and how it

14

had anything to do with the price of tea in that

15

particular case.

16

But -­

JUSTICE SCALIA:

No, you wouldn't.

All

17

you -- all you would have to know is that the claim is

18

based upon a statute -- is not based upon a statute and

19

that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence says if it's

20

not based upon a statute, it doesn't violate the

21

Establishment Clause.

22

MR. CLEMENT:

With respect, I don't think

23

that follows.

I mean, I think if -- if the Federal

24

executive tried to imprison you based on your religion,

25

you could take issue with that and say that's an

JUSTICE SCALIA:

I'd say it's a Free

4

Exercise Clause violation.

5

Establishment Clause for that.
MR. CLEMENT:

6

The problem in your

I don't think you need the

Well, if they said, well,

7

we're hereby establishing a religion and you're not part

8

of our religion and we're therefore imprisoning you, I

9

would think you could bring that claim.
But in all events, bringing it back to the

10
11

case before you, I think there is no reason to think

12

that ordinary principles of standing wouldn't give my

13

client every ability to challenge the constitutionality

14

of the statute under which she's being held.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

Mr. Clement, in the case

16

before us, are you making any claims other than that

17

Congress was acting outside its enumerated powers in

18

enacting this statute?

19

Amendment claims that you're making?

Are there any peculiarly Tenth

20

In other words, you admit that Congress is

21

acting within its enumerated powers and yet the action

22

violates the Tenth Amendment.

23

of that sort, or are all your claims that the statute

24

here goes beyond Congress's ability to enact it under

25

Article I?

Are you making any claims

6
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Kagan,

2

principally our argument here is an enumerated powers

3

argument.

4

understand some clearly defined set of Tenth Amendment

5

claims that are uniquely only Tenth Amendment claims and

6

not enumerated power claims.

My problem, though, is I'm not sure I

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

Well, let's just use the

8

Printz case and say, even though Congress might have the

9

ability to enact a statute under Article I, there's an

10

independent Tenth Amendment limitation.

11

claims of that kind in this case?
MR. CLEMENT:

12

Do you have any

Well, I don't think so, but

13

let me just say that my problem is -- take the Printz

14

case.

15

that it was an enumerated power case.

17

is not separate from enumerated powers.

Well, let's assume,

19

Mr. Clement, that there is such a thing as a claim in

20

which you're saying, I can see that this is within

21

Congress's Article I powers, but there is an independent

22

Tenth Amendment limitation on this.

23

claims like that?

24
25

MR. CLEMENT:

Do you have any

I don't think so, Justice

Kagan, but I'd hate to sort of bet my case that on
7
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

remand, I'm not going to say something in making an

2

argument that the government or somebody else thinks is

3

too much of a commandeering claim and too much -- not

4

enough of an enumerated power claim.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The government agrees

that it's an enumerated power claim in this case.
MR. CLEMENT:

Again, Justice Ginsburg, that

is the basis of our claim.

But just to give you a -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

You are -- you are at no

10

risk if the Court were just limited to what both of you

11

agree is involved -- Article I, Section 8 -- and if

12

there is a difference for commandeering claims, when the

13

case arises, we can deal with it.

14

MR. CLEMENT:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, you

15

could certainly do that, and as long as it is crystal

16

clear that there will be no obstacle to my client making

17

a constitutional attack on section 229 on remand, I

18

suppose that's fair enough for my client.

19

But one of the arguments we've preserved,

20

for example, is the argument that Missouri vs. Holland

21

is not a blank check for the government, that it

22

requires a balancing of the State's interests against

23

the Federal interests.

24

about the State's interest in criminal prosecution and

25

law enforcement, I would hate for a trap door to open up

And if on remand, I wax eloquent

8
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

at that point and I be told that, wait, wait, that's too

2

much of the State's interest and not enough of your own

3

interest.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

4

So you want us to say that

5

when there is a specific injury, specific to your

6

client, that your client has the right to make any

7

argument to show that the government has exceeded its

8

powers under the Constitution, because those powers are

9

limited to protect the liberties of the individual?
MR. CLEMENT:

10

Exactly right, Justice

11

Kennedy, and that's the fundamental worry I have here,

12

is that this Court's cases have not drawn a distinction

13

between commandeering claims and enumerated powers

14

claims.

15

York and Printz, both go out of their way to say that

16

they are mirror images or, in fact, enumerated power

17

claims, because a law that commandeers is not necessary

18

and proper.

The two cases the government points to, New

19

And I do also think that a part of the

20

problem with the suggestion that somehow Tennessee

21

Electric should be reimagined as a third party standing

22

claim is it fundamentally miscomprehends for whom the

23

structural provisions of the Constitution are there for.

24

Those provisions are there to protect the liberty of

25

citizens.

to raise a commandeering argument as a defense.

4

criminal prosecutions.

In that case -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

I don't

Mr. Clement, if you are not

6

making a commandeering claim, then we would be going out

7

of our way to decide that question.

8

are you making a commandeering claim?
MR. CLEMENT:

9

And so, you know,

I don't -- I don't

10

self-identify as having made a commandeering claim.

11

what I would say is -- we're not asking you to do

12

anything special.

13

that's asking you to go out of your way to

14

reconceptualize Tennessee Electric as a different kind

15

of case and preserve it.

I just think it's the government

JUSTICE ALITO:

16

But

Well, the problem is if

17

you're just making a treaty power claim, then how are

18

you going to possibly win on remand in the Third Circuit

if we reverse and say that your -- your client has

20

standing?

21

of the court of appeals to say that Missouri v. Holland

22

was wrong?

Do you think it falls within the prerogatives

MR. CLEMENT:

23

Well two things, Justice

24

Alito.

First, this is a technical matter.

25

back to the Third Circuit on our way back to coming here
11
Alderson Reporting Company

We could go

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

and we would still have standing to make an argument

2

that it's foreclosed by precedent.
But I think it's a mistake to think that

3
4

Missouri v. Holland is some bright-line rule that

5

forever answers this question.

6

Holland and as we clearly argued before the Third

7

Circuit, it's not a blank check.

8

a balancing test that looks at the State's interest and

9

the Federal interest in assessing whether or not the

As I read Missouri v.

It's really is more of

10

11

proper.

12

with Missouri against Holland because there the state's

13

interests was very weak because these birds were just

14

flying through on their way and there was no real State

15

interest, or so this Court held, whereas in this case

16

the State has a real legitimate interest in law

17

enforcement.

18

--

19

And I think this case compares pretty favorably

I also think we ought to be able to make

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does that depend on the

20

nature of the chemical that's involved?

21

chemical was -- was something that people would normally

22

understand as the kind of chemical that would be used in

23

a chemical weapon?

24

that this case doesn't involve something like that?

25

Suppose the

Let's say it's Sarin does it matter

MR. CLEMENT:

I think it does, Justice
12

Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Alito.

I think it would matter in part for a

2

constitutional avoidance statutory construction

3

argument, which I think also ought to be open to us.

4

sort of think by analogy to the Jones case, where this

5

Court said that a Federal statute about arson doesn't

6

apply when a cousin throws a Molotov cocktail at a

7

residence.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

I assume

we're not getting into those merits questions here.
MR. CLEMENT:

No, I was trying to respond to

the question of whether we would be foreclosed.

question rather than a standing question.

But you're

I thought we were just doing standing.

MR. CLEMENT:

15

All right.

No, we're not asking you to do

more than do standing.

But I do think it's important to

17

understand that we don't think we would be limited to

18

just losing on Missouri v. Holland below and coming back

19

up.

20

Missouri v. Holland as applied.

We think we have a very good argument about

We also think that there is sort of a

21
22

statutory construction argument.

And this isn't sarin.

23

There is something sort of odd about the government's

24

theory that says that I can buy a chemical weapon at

25

Amazon.com.

That strikes me as odd, and that seems to
13
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

me the kind of thing where you could make a statutory

2

construction to say, well, maybe sarin or maybe actual

3

chemical weapons, that's one thing, but with respect to

4

this kind of commonly available chemical, to say without

5

any jurisdictional element or anything like that, that

6

it's a Federal crime seems like an argument we at least

7

ought to have standing to make.
JUSTICE BREYER:

8
9

What do you say about the

one thing -- the strongest point against you, I think,

10

is a single sentence in that TVA case.

It's only one

11

sentence, but it's there in the opinion, and I think

12

what it's saying, Justice Roberts says, well, he already

13

finished, he just finished saying nobody -- Congress

14

hasn't violated some rule against creating a system of

15

regulation in this statute because it isn't regulation.

16

But then he said, but even if it were, even if it were,

17

and if your complaint was that Congress has acted

18

outside its authority, which they might have thought at

19

that time, in creating a system, TVA, that competes with

20

local systems, even if that were so, the appellants,

21

absent the State or their officers, would have no

22

standing in this suit to raise the question.
Okay, now, that -- they put quite a lot on

23
24

to that.

That is what it says.

So are we supposed to

25

say, well, that was an ill-considered dicta?
14
Alderson Reporting Company

Or are we

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

supposed to say it was just wrong?

2

say the law has changed?

3

supposed to -- or is different.

4

we supposed to say?
MR. CLEMENT:

5

Are we supposed to

What in your view are we
What in your view are

Could I say two things about

6

that sentence, and then explain what I really think you

7

should say?

8

about that sentence is that I don't think, read in the

9

context of the entire opinion, it actually means that

10

the Court is trying to impose a special disability on

11

Tenth Amendment claims, because remember, they have

12

already rejected the plaintiff's basis for having

13

standing.

First of all, the first thing I would say

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

So it comes out of left

15

field, and it's an overall "any, even, if."

16

suggests it's just dicta and doesn't count.

So that

day that you somehow have a license to bring a Tenth

23

was right then and it continues to be right.

25

But what I think it stands for is the proposition
it rejects the argument that if you don't otherwise

A second point to make about it is it is

the following:

So it is dictum I think and can be disregarded as such.

12

But really if you ask me what you should do

13

with it, you should do what you did in Twombly, with

14

some language in an opinion that had continued to cause

15

trouble in the 50 years since.

16

that's no longer good law because it's not.

17

holding of Tennessee Electric was overruled 40 years ago

18

in the Camp case, and I think this language is of a

19

piece from that legal interest test, the legal wrong

20

test of standing, and I think this Court should make

21

clear that it doesn't apply any longer, and the virtue

22

of that would be that it would free up the lower courts

23

to decide these Tenth Amendment standing claims based on

24

an application of normal standing principles, because

25

that's not happening in the lower court right now.

4

what they're confronted with, especially if it's a

He can do that.

He may wish to raise as

2

contrary.

The Third Circuit erred in holding to the

Now, the Third Circuit in reaching the

3
4

contrary conclusion relied on this Court's decision in

5

Tennessee Electric v. TVA, and we think that the court

6

of appeals misread that case in concluding that it

7

barred standing, not because it lacks a holding that

8

does bar standing of certain types of claims that allege

9

an invasion of State sovereignty, but because the kind

10

of claim that Petitioner is making is not a Tenth

11

Amendment reserved rights claim, but instead an

12

enumerated powers claim.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

It's kind of hard

14

under our precedents to draw that precise line between

15

enumerated powers and the Tenth Amendment, and it seems

16

a bit much to put defendant to the trouble of trying to

17

do that under the theory from TVA that they have no

18

standing to make a particular type of Tenth Amendment

19

claim.

20

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

21

think that the defendant needs to be put in any trouble

22

in this case because the kind of claim that counsel is

23

making on her behalf does assert her right not to be

24

subject to criminal punishment under a law that he says,

counsel says, Congress lacks the authority to enact.

argument, which category does that fall into?

If she makes that

It falls into the enumerated

10

powers category, Justice Alito, just as last term in

11

United States v. Comstock one of the elements that this

12

Court looked at when it decided whether the law

13

authorizing civil commitment in that case was within

14

Congress's enumerated authority plus the Necessary and

15

Proper Clause, the Court looked at the extent to which

16

the law accommodated State interests or, alternatively,

17

invaded them in an unlawful manner, which is what Mr.

18

Comstock had alleged in that case.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

19

But you're -- you want us

20

to say that, even if the defendant in some case might

21

show that a constitutional violation is causing that

defendant specific injury, the defendant may not be able

to raise the claim of its, what you call sovereignty

claim?

to me that is inconsistent with the position you're

5

taking.

6

That

And it seems to me also consistent -­

The whole point of separation of powers, the

whole point of federalism, is that it inheres to the

11

individual and his or her right to liberty; and if that

12

is infringed by a criminal conviction or in any other

13

way that causes specific injury, why can't it be raised?

14

I just don't understand your point.
MR. DREEBEN:

15

Well, Justice Kennedy, I -- I

16

don't take issue with almost everything that you said.

17

The structural protections of the Constitution can be

18

enforced by individuals under the cases that you have

19

cited.

20

What we are dealing with here is two things.

21

First of all, a statement that this Court made in TVA

22

that was part of its holding, addressed to what the

23

Court perceived as an attack based on a specific aspect

24

of State sovereignty that belonged to the States.

25

today, we might not understand the claim that was made

Alderson Reporting Company

Now,

in that case as implicating a specific sovereign right

2

that's protected under the Tenth Amendment.

might look at it and say this is nothing other than a

conventional preemption claim.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Today we

I don't know whether that's

6

a correct characterization of the argument that was made

7

in -- in the Tennessee Electric case.

8

at the brief in the case, and the discussion of the

9

Tenth Amendment generally follows a caption that says

10

the power to dispose of Federal property does not

11

include any power to regulate local activities.

12

I don't understand why that isn't the same

13

kind of delegated powers argument that you say the

14

Petitioner here is raising.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

That may be, Justice Alito.

I

16

think that it's a little bit difficult to parse

17

precisely what the Petitioner in Tennessee Electric was

18

arguing, but this Court understood the claim as one that

19

-- that bore on Federal regulation of purely local

20

matters in a matter that regulated the internal affairs

21

of the State; and I agree with you that today we might

22

not view that as a Tenth Amendment-specific claim, but

23

this Court did in 1939.

might have decided to charge it on their own anyway, and

there was no standing on the grounds that when the

chemical weapon.

And a toxic

I'm willing to make the

assumption with you and accept that it is a

broad-reaching statute, but it was adopted as a

broad-reaching statute because this is an area, like the

recognized, Justice Alito, that when Congress seeks to

11

regulate an interstate market as to which there cannot

be any question under the Commerce Clause Congress could

13

do, it can control the interstate market as necessary in

order to assure that its prohibition is effective.

The merits of the case,

25

though, involve both a Commerce Clause argument, a

treaty-based argument.

As far as the standing

fact, if you look at Petitioner's brief in support of

The relevant standing doctrine in this case

is the prudential rule against third-party standing.

one disputes here that the Petitioner has Article III

standing.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think

2

Pennsylvania would be upset that the Federal Government

3

got her when they couldn't?

4

MR. McALLISTER:

No, that's my point.

And

5

so my point is that her interests are directly contrary

6

to Pennsylvania's interests.

8

let me articulate and argue the interests of the State.

I share the interests of the State; therefore,

JUSTICE SCALIA:

So she's not stepping in

Well, in a -- in another

case, conceivably, the State Attorney General can

whether to prosecute or not for standard crimes that

17

have no relation to interstate commerce or any other

Federal power.

Isn't that something for the State to be
We want to have the discretion of

MR. McALLISTER:

19

Well, it's standard that

20

both sovereigns have the ability often to prosecute if

21

the definitions of crimes overlap, and there's nothing

22

that prevents Pennsylvania from prosecuting her again

23

here.

JUSTICE SCALIA:

She wants to make the

argument that the definitions don't overlap.
37
Alderson Reporting Company

She wants

to make the argument that this is a strictly State,

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, in -­

6

JUSTICE SCALIA:

That's what she's trying to

7

do.

Why doesn't she have standing to make that

8

argument?
MR. McALLISTER:

9

Because the lower courts,

10

at least, in their defense, understood this to be a

11

Tenth Amendment claim, and there are reasons for that.

Now, in this Court neither the Petitioner nor the

But if you look in the Joint Appendix, pages

26 to 32 is the supplemental brief that her lawyer filed

19

when the Third Circuit said, post-argument:

21

a standing issue.

22

Hey, good idea; we don't think she does have standing.

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

That single sentence

3

doesn't seem -- I'm trying to figure it out.

It doesn't

4

seem to refer to just all Tenth Amendment claims.

5

There's a footnote and it talks about no standing in

6

this suit.
Then if you look back at the lower court

7
8

case, it seemed to be referring to a particular argument

9

where the challengers had said the Property Clause

10

doesn't give authority to the government to pass this.

11

The reply was, that was true in Alabama, and the Court

12

said it was okay.

13

Alabama agreed.

14

was in that context that Georgia says it doesn't make

15

any difference.

Then the challengers say:

Oh, but

And then Georgia doesn't agree.

And it

But if Georgia was going to disagree or

16
17

agree, if that's what it turned on, we better have

18

Georgia say whether they agree or disagree, and not have

19

people who aren't Georgia.

saying to me at the moment.

That's what he seems to be

If I'm right, what's comparable to that in

21
22

this case?

Is there some claim that she's making that

23

it would be constitutional if they agreed in the State

24

and it wouldn't be if not?

25

she means it's constitutional irrespective.

I don't think so.

No, he cites.

there's -- if this is a Tenth Amendment claim, there is

there is no standing.

aspect of it, again, the issue is:

she has Article III standing, but not necessarily to

MR. McALLISTER:

21

As I understand her

complaint, basically her argument is that unless this

statute is authorized by something in Article I,

24

section 8, the first 17 clauses, there's no power to

25

enact it.

And that's why this case is, frankly, not

were straight commerce power cases under section 3.

3

This is a treaty power case under Article II, and she

4

only wants to read the first half of the Necessary and

5

Proper Clause, which refers to all the foregoing powers.

6

But it also says necessary and proper for all other

7

powers.

Those

That's -- you haven't

Why isn't that a merits

10

decision as to whether or not the President and Congress

11

have the power to enact this legislation?

12

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, Your Honor, in

13

essence, at the end of the day, it will be a merits

14

question, but from a standing argument, trying to define

15

what is a Tenth Amendment claim -- and the point I was

16

trying to make, perhaps not successfully, is that she's

17

not saying -- well, she is sort of saying the Article I,

18

section 8 enumerated powers are the limits.

19

frankly, they can't be the limits.

20

But

In light of the plain language of the

21

Necessary and Proper Clause and Missouri v. Holland and

22

90 years of this Court's precedent under the treaty

23

power, those powers are not limits.

24

they're limits and saying, I'm really making an Article

25

I claim, but that simply lets her always have standing,
42
Alderson Reporting Company

So she's asserting

because, even in the commandeering cases, the plaintiff

can say, this is about Article I, this is not about the

drill down and characterize what the nature of the claim

5

actually is.

And so at some point the Court has to

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

Well, why do we have

7

to do that?

It -- it seems to me we've had a lot of

8

discussion this morning about whether this is an

9

enumerated powers claim or a Tenth Amendment claim.

10

They really do kind of blend together, and it seems to

11

me awfully difficult to put on a criminal defendant the

12

responsibility to decide whether this is going to be an

13

enumerated powers claim or this is going to be a Tenth

14

Amendment claim.

15

together, and why does it make -- again, why does it

16

make that much of a difference and why do you put the

17

burden on the defendant to parse the claim one way or

18

another, since I assume they can make pretty much all

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's

Mr. McAllister, I guess I

18

don't understand why that makes a difference.

19

Necessary and Proper Clause says "foregoing powers" and

20

it says "other powers."

21

Congress is acting under the other powers part of the

22

Necessary and Proper Clause, but the question in either

23

event is the extent of the Necessary and Proper Clause

24

and what it allows Congress to do.

25

The

This happens to be a case where

So in -- in that sense, whether it's a
44
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

treaty power case or not a treaty power case just

2

doesn't matter.

3

scope of authority is under the Necessary and Proper

4

Clause.

5

It's all a question of what Congress's

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, I would disagree

6

somewhat, Your Honor, respectfully, that -- her argument

7

about the Necessary and Proper Clause I don't think is

8

that this -- this -- she's not arguing the statute is an

9

irrational or unreasonable way to implement the treaty

10

obligations of the United States.

What she's arguing is

11

that the treaty power itself does not give Congress the

12

power to enact section 229 unless, in essence, you don't

13

need the treaty, because you already have the power, the

14

government does, under the first 17 clauses of Article

15

I, Section 8.

16

So, yes, the Necessary and Proper Clause is

17

the connection here to Article I, Section 8, but it's a

18

minimal connection, and -- and she's not arguing sort of

19

the -- - the -- I don't think, the Comstock kind of

20

argument that this isn't tied to, rationally, to some

21

sort of articulated power.

22

The government clearly has power to enter

23

treaties under Article II, section 2, and so that to me

24

is the distinguishing feature from all those other

25

Article I, section 8, cases.

This -- I agree; I don't

45
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

think I could stand up here and -- and try to argue to

2

you this is a true Tenth Amendment case if, in fact,

3

this had been litigated as a commerce power case all

4

along.
JUSTICE ALITO:

5

I'm not sure I -- I'm not

6

sure I understood what you just said.

7

that -- that she is arguing that Congress does not have

8

the power to enact legislation that's necessary and

9

proper for the implementation of treaties, but only for

10

the making of treaties; that she's making that argument

11

that's been made by some academic writers?
MR. McALLISTER:

12

Are you saying

No, I'm not sure that's

13

what I meant to say, Justice Alito.

14

trying to say is her argument is not -- well, I think

15

her argument is in essence a challenge to the treaty

16

power.

17

the treaty power, because she says the statute has to be

18

based on something in Article I, section 8, first 17

19

clauses; and if it's based on something there, then the

20

treaty power adds nothing to Congress's ability to enact

21

legislation; and that's inconsistent with the plain

22

language of the Necessary and Proper Clause, the fact

23

that the treaty power is in Article II, not in Article

24

I, section 8.

25

What -- what I was

It's one step removed, but it is a challenge to

And so under her view of the world -- as I
46
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

understand it; I'm sure Mr. Clement will correct me if

2

I'm wrong about my understanding -- is that really you

3

don't need a treaty, the treaty doesn't add anything.

4

mean, it may be the reason that Congress decides at this

5

point in time to enact section 229.

6

understood her argument, if it has the commerce power to

7

do it, United States never entered -- needed to enter a

8

treaty in order for Congress to enact section 229.

9

in other words, as I understand her argument, the treaty

10

power adds nothing to the domestic legislative authority

11

of Congress.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But I believe, as I

So

Mr. McAllister, have you

13

found any case other than this one where a criminal

14

defendant was held to have lacked standing to challenge

15

a statute under which the defendant was prosecuted?

16

MR. McALLISTER:

I

Not in this Court, Justice

17

Ginsburg, but there are examples in the circuits, a few.

18

There are examples from the Eighth Circuit, from the

19

Tenth Circuit involving criminal prosecutions where the

20

Court characterized the claim as a Tenth Amendment claim

21

and said, in light of TVA, the criminal defendant does

22

not have standing to make that claim.

23

examples in the lower courts.

24

example in this Court.

25

So there are

I'm not aware of an

And I would say this, too, about the -­
47
Alderson Reporting Company

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

there's some argument about the separation of powers

2

cases in which the Court has typically allowed

3

individuals to make that claim.

4

talking about prudential rules and third-party standing,

5

or at least I'm talking about that, one prudential

6

consideration is in those cases, whether it's Chadha,

7

whether it's Clinton v. New York, the recent Free

8

Enterprise case, the Federal Government is always very

9

much present.

Again, because we're

It may be representing the defendant in

10

those cases, it may simply intervene or come in as an

11

amicus, it gets notice if the Federal statute is

12

challenged as being unconstitutional.
The difference in the Tenth Amendment

13
14

setting is there's no mechanism, practically, to notify

15

the States or solicit the States for their interests.

16

Someone's raising this claim that says the government is

17

intruding on your sovereign interests; there's no

mechanism to allow the States.

24

all that would happen in a criminal suit is that the

Alderson Reporting Company

Because

mean that the State is bound in some way.

2

wasn't a party to the criminal action.
MR. McALLISTER:

3

The State

Well, the State isn't a

4

party, but what gets said in those cases about the scope

5

of the State's prerogatives vis-à-vis the Federal

6

Government could well be brought to bear in other cases

7

in other settings, commandeering cases.
Again, the concern in the third-party

8
9

standing case is that you're not actually a party, but

10

someone else is making arguments in a sense on your

11

behalf.

12

of the arguments they should be making or they don't

13

articulate them the way the State does -- there's still

14

stare decisis effect of those decisions on the States.

15

They lose, because perhaps they don't know all

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, there's two things

16

that could happen.

17

-- and it doesn't want to lose -- it passes its own law.

18

Or if it wins, if the case is as stated below, it just

19

lets the status quo go.

20

the long-term injury to the State is or could be.

21

One is that if the State loses, then

I still don't understand what

MR. McALLISTER:

Well, I guess again, and

22

maybe I'm misapprehending, but the long-term interest is

23

a -- is a decision, say in the criminal case, that says,

24

no, this doesn't intrude on the State's sovereignty, is

25

there as a matter of stare decisis.
49
Alderson Reporting Company

So if in a later

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

case the State wants to in fact assert that this

2

particular statute does intrude on our sovereignty, it's

3

not that they can't necessarily raise the claim, but

4

they will confront contrary precedent that the State

5

never had a chance to -- to voice its opinion or its

6

views at the time the issue was being adjudicated.
JUSTICE KENNEDY:

7

Your underlying premise is

8

that the individual has no interest in whether or not

9

the State has surrendered its powers to the Federal

10

Government, and I just don't think the Constitution was

11

framed on that theory.
MR. McALLISTER:

12

Well, Justice Kennedy, I

13

don't know that I would say they have no interest, but I

14

am -- I guess the premise I'm asserting is they do not

15

necessarily get to assert the Tenth Amendment claim of

16

the States.

17

a case where the State initially said we're not

18

concerned about this regulation, and then changed its

19

mind; and the Court in New York said States don't waive

20

those Tenth Amendment rights; States can then -- can

21

change its mind and bring a suit, and there's no

22

indication -­

23

MR. McALLISTER:

11

Well, and that's a

12

conclusion the Court can reach.

13

Petitioner's position essentially holds is that there's

14

never a question of third-party standing for any claim

15

under the Constitution, basically, not the kind I'm

16

talking about; and that no claims are limited to certain

17

categories of litigants.
JUSTICE SCALIA:

MR. CLEMENT:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

14

Just a few points in rebuttal.

First of

all, one reason not to carve out a special rule for

claims are created equal.

18

commandeering claim that has been litigated in the

context of SORNA, the sex registration act.

know the details of that enough to know whether that's a

21

valid commandeering claim or not, or whether there's a

22

redressability problem in that particular case.

23

can certainly imagine a commandeering case, a Federal

simple citation to Tennessee Electric and let's move on,

and that's really what should stop.
A second reason that you should not try to

9

They're resolving those challenges with a

carve out commandeering cases as being somehow the

10

residuum of the Tennessee Electric dictum is because

11

Tennessee Electric says nothing about commandeering

12

cases.

It just talks broadly about Tenth Amendment

13

cases.

You know, we can disagree or agree; it's kind of

14

hard to figure out what the nature of the claim was in

15

Tennessee Electric.
I don't think it was really much different

16
17

from the claim that we're raising here, which is in

18

Tennessee Electric they said, well, if the Federal

19

Government gets to regulate power, what's left of

20

State's traditional prerogative to regulate the price

21

for power.

22

Here is if the Federal Government can go in

23

and prosecute you for putting vinegar in your neighbor's

think they're very similar arguments.
53
Alderson Reporting Company

I

But whatever else

Official - Subject to Final Review

is true, I just don't think Tennessee Electric limited

before.

they should not be allowed to sneak the Commerce Clause

back into the case at this late stage.

The Government gets to confess air, it
