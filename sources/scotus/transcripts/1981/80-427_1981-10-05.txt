NEWBURGER:

St. Louis County initiated a series

the state of Missouri.

In the middle of the process of raising the issue

Missouri, the Cassillys,

a citizen organization in which they were

Particularly, they alleged two violations of

2 rights.

First, they alleged that they had been placed in a

3 category of

classification of homeowners that was separate

4 from homeowners in general,

that is, new homeowners, and

5 that as new homeowners their real property was assessed at
6 the rate of

33 and a third percent of its fair market value

7 when other homeowners were assessed
8 prevailing market rate of

on average at a

approximately 22 percent of its

9 fair market value.

Secondly, they alleged that in the course of

10

11 appealing certain assessments over the years, and
12 particularly

in one particular year, they were successful in

13 their appeal and their assessed

value was reduced, but that

14 they and everybody else who had appealed in that year
15 through

the state process had been automatically called up

16 for reassessment in
17 in

the second year, thus that they were put

a classification of people who had exercised their right

18 to appeal and when

people exercised their right to appeal

19 they were separated into a

separate class and subjected to a

20 reassessment that raised them back to where they had been
21 assessed in
22

the first place.

QUESTION;

Mr. Newburger, is there any issue here

23 of whether your complaint stated a cause of action in
24

ME. NEWBURGER:

1983?

I do not believe that anybody has

25 seriously challenged whether we stated a cause of action.

1

QUESTION:

I am just wondering whether we ought

2 not get that.
3

MR. NEWBURGER;

As far as I can see, we have in

4 fact alleged a cause of action, and the District Court
5 dismissed us out exclusively on the subject of the Tax
6 Injunction Act, and, Mr. Justice Brennan, in connection with
7 that, I would also like to narrow today's discussion in
8 another respect.

While one of the Petitioners is an

9 association of citizens, this Act -- this lawsuit has been
10 determined solely on the basis of the Cassillys' claim, and
11 the question that we come down to is the interest today of
12 these homeowners in their right to pursue their 1983 action
13 in light of the Tax Injunction Act in Federal Court.
14

QUESTION:

In other words, whether, in spite of

15 the fact that the Tax Injunction Act has been extended to
16 declaratory judgments, it should also be extended to
17 monetary relief?
18

MR. NEWBURGER:

Yes.

Judge Nangle, the District

19 Court Judge who heard the case, dismissed the case on the
20 grounds, stating that this was like a tax refund action, on
21 the grounds that the Tax Injunction Act barred this action,
22 an action at law for damages.
23

QUESTION:

Was he suggesting, when he said it was

24 like a tax refund action, that that in any event would be
25 the limit of any 1983 damages?

A refund of the excess tax?

1

MR. NEWBURGERi

Again, Your Honor, when one gets

2 into a situation that a case is being decided on a motion to
3 dismiss, it is difficult sometimes to know what facts really
4 will be material.

In Petitioners' complaint, they allege

5 damages in excess of the amount of tax refund, and I am
6 speaking specifically about the Cassillys, wholly aside from
7 Fair Assessment in Real Estate.
8

QUESTION i

Including punitive damages?

9

HR. NEWBURGERi

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. NEWBURGER:

I'm sorry?

Including punitive?
Including, but not exclusively.

12 We have assessed both excessive taxes and other monetary
13 damages in some of the years of the complaint and punitive
14 damages, and seek to recover those.

I thnk that when we

15 have the discussion from Judge Nangle, when he says this is
16 like a tax refund action, I think we should recognize
17 another element of his decision, and that is, he said
18 compared to Younger against Harris.

Without much analysis

19 of what that meant, he was suggesting, I think, that the
20 difficulty in this case is the difficulty of Federalism,
21 that it is a question of whether the Federal Courts, the
22 lower Federal Courts should hear a Section 1983 action at
23 law for damages in the context of a claim that the entire
24 process is a part of the state taxation process, which is
25 obviously terribly important to keep within the confines of

QUESTION*

Nell, that was certainly the thrust of

3 Great Lakes versus Huffman, wasn't it, that just because it
4 said injunction didn't mean that it was limited to
5 injunction *
6
7Rehnguist.

HR. NEWBURGER;

That is right, Mr. Justice

In Great Lakes against Huffman, the Court

8 confined itself to the subject of declaratory judgment
9 actions, which was the question presented, and our tradition
10 is to recognize that declaratory judgments actions are not
11 quite equity actions but certainly are in the realm that is
12 somewhat similar to equity actions, and indeed the argument
13 that I would present to this Court, is that on the language
14 and the legislative history and the precedents, like the
15 Great Lakes case itself, that on all of those terms, that
16 Section 1341, the Tax Injunction Act, bars the Federal
17 Courts from hearing cases in which the claim is for the
18 exercise of anything in the order of equity jurisdiction.
19

But I likewise submit that there is nothing in the

20 statute or the legislative history or the precedents to
21 suggest that the claim for damages should be barred.
22

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Newburger, before we ever had

23 1341, I gather the jurisprudence of this Court was, at the
24 very least, wasn't it, that you had to do administrative
25 exhaustion, administrative exhaustion in the state, and that

7

2

not ?

HR. NEWBURGER;

QUESTION:

MR. NEWBURGER:

Now, do you think that 1341 in any way

that it —

affected that jurisdictional requirement?

8
9

That is right. Your Honor.

So that left standing, Weld County

would still be good law, notwithstanding 1341.
HR. NEWBURGER;

13

I would take the view that Monroe

14

against Fape and the cases that followed from that have

15

determined the exhaustion question in respect to this

16

matter.

17

in a diversity case simply based on an argument of some

18

inappropriate taxation or taxation contrary to state law

19

would be able to hear that case without going through the

20

processes of administrative exhaustion.

21

22

I certainly do not believe that the Federal Courts

QUESTION:

At 21 of your brief, you cite Matthews

and Rodgers.

23

MR. NEWBURGER:

24

QUESTION;

25

Yes, Your Honor.

And the conclusion of the quotation you

cite from suggests that a suit at law in the Federal Courts,

if the essential elements of Federal jurisdiction are

2 present.

Now, didn't that at least contemplate that you had

3

to exhaust your administrative remedies, as a Federal

4

jurisdictional prerequisite, before you could maintain a

5

suit at law in the Federal Courts?

6

MR. NEWBURGER;

In a proper case in which the

7

question of exhaustion of administrative or judicial

8

remedies is presented.
QUESTION;

9

Incidentally, did you exhaust the

10

administrative remedies in this --

take is that exhaustion is not required.

And in one of the years, the

The other fact that is terribly important to the

that you are pressing me on is whether, if we do
with our case, we actually are posing a problem with

state taxes, and I think that it is

10 prosecuted here has only minimal impact on
11 the

taxation processes in the State of Missouri.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 recall, Mr. Justice Stevens, relates back to the question of
2 whether such a classification is palpably arbitrary, and
3 indeed that is the reason that I am using the word "bad
4 faith" in this discussion.

I would take the view that that

5 kind of classification has no apparent justification on its
6 face unless there is some kind of legitimate public policy
7 of discouraging the construction of new homes which I have a
8 very hard time contemplating.
9

QUESTION;

Well, what if the statute had a

10 preamble reciting that the additional expense in connection
11 with new construction, building permits, inspections, and so
12 forth, justified this?
13 then?

Would you have any problem with it

There are additional expenses for new homes, are

14 there not?
15

MR. NEWBURGER:

Yes, certainly there are expenses

16 for new homes, including a building permit, which indeed
17 could be characterized as a tax.
18

QUESTION;

And building inspections.

19

MR. NEWBURGER;

20 characterized as a tax.

And building inspections could be
If there were that kind of rational

21 basis for the distinction, then it may be that the
22 classification is not palpably arbitrary, but it seems to me
23 that it is important for us to remember a couple of facts.
24 One, under the law and the constitution of Missouri, there
25 is no classification of real property to be recognized.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 That is a ground rule in the State of Missouri.
2

QUESTION;

Yes, but if we are talking about the

3 Federal Constitution, does it really matter to us whether
4 the classification is made by the legislature or by the
5 people who collect the taxes, if they do it on a uniform
6 basis and make tha particular rule?
7

ME. NEWBUBGER :

The second argument that I would

8 make arises out of Sioux City against Breckenridge, which is
9 a 1923 decision of this Court, and that is that if you have
10 by happenstance a development in which there are some people
11 who are assessed at a much higher rate than the prevailing
12 rate throughout the country, that that is a palpably
13 arbitrary distinction that creates a classification that is
14 not consistent with the equal protection clause.
15

QUESTION*

But this one by your own allegation is

16 not a happenstance or an accident.

They have a state policy

17 of treating new homes at one rate and older homes at a
18 different rate, and it seems you have conceded that it is
19 not palpably arbitrary.
20

MR. NEWBURGER;

21

QUESTION;

No, I didn't mean to concede --

If there was a statute, you conceded

22 it, I mean.
23

MR. NEWBURGER;

I am suggesting that there are

24 circumstances in which a program can be established in which
25 distinction can be drawn in different kinds of real

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 property.

I would suggest that in the exact circumstances

2 of this case,

that it is necessary for me to prove in the

3

District Court, if I am going to be heard on this case, that

4

these classifications are palpably arbitrary.

5

in making that proof is that what had happened was, because

6 of
7

My intention

an absence of reassessment in the county, the county

permitted old properties to continue at their level of

8 assessment for some 20 years, and at the same time engaged
9
10

in an activity of assessing new property at 33 and a third
percent of the fair market value of that property.
Now, that, I suggest, is not a decision that was

11
12 based

upon a rational basis, that there is not a distinction

13

to be drawn between that old property and the new property.

14

I think that is exactly what the case was in Sioux City, and

15

the Court in that case taught all of us that that was a

16

classification that was unconstitutional within the equal

17

protection clause.

18
19

20
21

QUESTION*
Sioux City?

When was the last time anybody cited

I haven’t read it, to be honest with you.

MB. NEWBURGER*

Well, it is interesting.

Sioux

City was cited in 1978, I believe is the year, by the

22 Supreme Court of Missouri,

to tell the assessors that in

23

fact that is the controlling law of the land, and that they

24

ought to have either been assessing property at that lower

25

22 percent or they ought to be assessing everybody at the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 higher 33 percent.

The important question/ though, here, is

2 a question of Federal jurisdiction, and while it is
3 certainly fair and fair game to take after me on the
4 question of whether I am going to prove that equal
5 protection violation if I am returned to District Court,
6 that is not what Judge Nangle did in dismissing me, and what
7 he did in dismissing me was to determine that I was barred
8 either by the Tax Injunction Act or by some analogy to the
9 Younger against Harris doctrine.
10

QUESTION;

Was there an answer in this case, or

11 just a motion to dismiss?

MR. NEWBURGER;

There are two different sets of

HR. NEWBURGER;

QUESTION;

I believe that is right.

constitutional basis, he shouldn't be held liable to

damages.

6

HR. NEWBURGER;

7

QUESTION;

I believe that is correct.

So, I just wonder why in this case, if

8

you are going to have to prove -- if there is any doubt

9

about the equal protection violation, I would think the

10

immunity defense is going to be fairly solid.
MR. NEWBURGER;

11

Well, I agree with that, Your

12

Honor, except that if you go back through the history of

13

what has gone on in this case in the state Courts, I believe

14

that the defendants fully understood that they were

15

violating the constitutional rights of the individual.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. WEHRLE, ESQ.,

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

22

MR. WEHRLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

23 Court, I would just like to make one comment on Mr.
24 Newburger’s statement that he felt that this case could have
25 a chilling effect upon the tax officials of St. Louis County

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and of the State of Missouri.

I believe that is why we are

2 here, because we feel that this Court and all the other
3 Courts as well as Congress, that their intent was when they
4 passed the Tax Injunction Act, was to keep Federal District
5 Courts from interfering with the collection of state taxes
6 as far as the method, assessment, levy, and collection was
7 concerned, and when he says that no doubt that this cause of
8 action will have a chilling effect upon tax officials, then
9 we submit to you that it is the reason, that is the reason
10 why Judge Nangle said what he said, because he said he could
11 not in any way go into this lawsuit without actually
12 becoming an Appellate Court in regard to the assessment of
13 taxes in St. Louis County.
14

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Wehrle, the statute, of

15 course, in words, deals only with enjoining, suspending, or
16 restraining, doesn't it?
17 action for money damages.

And here what you have is an
Is that an action to suspend or

18 enjoin or restrain?
19

MR. WEHRLE*

I think it would be an action to

20 restrain and suspend, not to enjoin, because when we look at
21 what the meanings of those words are, restrain, to restrain
22 and suspend, restrain, you know, to pull the effect back.
23 And so if any cause of action, be it an injunction suit,
24 declaratory judgment suit, a suit for a tax refund, or just
25 a plain damage suit like this, it is going to have the

23

22 first is going to have to go into the manner of assessment,
23 how the assessment was arrived at comparing new homes to old
24 homes, and how it was applied, and then we submit, then you
25 are getting back into an attack on tax assessment, and this

1 Court as well as all other Federal Courts, the history has
2 been that they have deferred to the state Courts.
3

They say, you have a plain, speedy, efficient

4 remedy in the state Courts, you take your matter to the
5 state Courts, do not come to the Federal Courts.

That has

6 been the history, even before the Tax Injunction Act, and we
7 submit that since that Tax Injunction Act, that the Courts
8 have -- they started out with injunction suits, but then
9 they have gone to declaratory judgment suits, they have gone
10 to tax refund suits.

The Ninth Circuit and the Eighth

11 Circuit have said that on a tax refund suit, which was not
12 -- there was no such thing as a tax refund suit as far as
13 when the Tax Injunction Act was passed, but in those two
14 Circuits they have said that what Congress intended, what
15 the Federal Courts have done in the past, we now extend to a
16 tax refund suit, and therefore the Tax Injunction Act would
17 bar us.

QUESTIONS

You don't need the Tax Injunction Act.

Judge Kangle said —
But you would be satisfied with comity,

17

MR. WEHRLE:

You pay your tax under protest, and

19 that point we say, besides that, they take an appeal, the
20 County Board of Equalization, to the State Tax Commission,

2 That is how the Breckenridge case went up.

It was on a tax

3 protest case.
4

QUESTION:

If instead of this being a

5 discrimination between new homeowners and old homeowners, if
6 the discrimination was based on, say, racial classification
7 or national origin or something like that, and there was an
8 allegation that all the persons of a given race were
9 assessed at a different basis, and that was state policy and
10 so forth, you would still say that claim had to be asserted
11 in the state Court?
12

K R. WEHRLE;

Yes, sir, because, Judge, I think the

13 Tax Injunction Act would come in for this reason.

I do not

14 believe that there is any way you could arrive at that
15 decision without going into the matter of assessment.

You

16 have to do it.
17

QUESTION;

The only issue would be whether the

18 principle of taxing at different rates because, in this
19 case, they are new homeowners as opposed to old, or in the
20 other case because they are members of Race A instead of
21 Race B, that that principle is either right or wrong.

You

22 couldn’t raise that issue at all in a Federal Court under

23 your view.
24

MR. WEHRLE;

That is right, Judge, because of the

25 fact of, I think, Bland versus KcHann.

That was a case in

of their race, and because of the demonstrations, that their

property tax assessments had been increased, but the Court

said, we have to inquire into the method of assessment, and

Yes, sir.
But that was equity.

That was equity, wasn’t it?

MR. WEHRLE:

That was equity, yes, sir, but he was

11 extending it, saying, well, since that has been the history,
12 and that has been, as the Court said in Bland versus McHann,
13 the long-standing judicial policy, and Congressional
14 restriction of Federal jurisdiction in cases involving state
15 tax administration makes it the duty of Federal Courts to
16 withhold relief, and I think that is what Judge Nangle had,
17 the long-standing policy of the Federal Courts and
18 Congressional restraint.

QUESTION;

And did not hide it behind a general

7 statement of an equally divided Court.
8

MR. WEHRLE;

I believe, Judge, the only thing I

9 might say, and it might be speculation on my part, is, right
10 before that the Court, I think it was the Seventh Circuit,
11 came out with the Fulton Market case, in which they
12 permitted a damage suit under 1983, and said that the Tax
13 Injunction Act would not bar it, and I say possibly four of
14 the Judges on the Eighth Circuit thought maybe they should
15 follow that, and four might think they could distinguish it,
16 and I think it can be distinguished.

I do not think it is

17 so applicable.

1 question, if I may.

Do I correctly assume that in your

3 that the state remedy is inadequate in any way?

MR. WEHRLE:

5 is adequate.

No, sir, we say that the state remedy

Yes, sir.

QUESTION:

8 have appealed in the state and it is still pending.
9 years, they did not.

1975 and

Two

1976 they did not appeal; on

10 1978 and 1979 they have appealed.

So I assume that they

11 feel it is adequate.
12

QUESTION:

I should ask them, but I wanted to get

13 your impression.
14

MR. WEHRLE:

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. WEHRLE:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Mr. Wehrle -Yes, ma'am.
-- would you agree that Congress simply

18 wasn't thinking of a damages suit under Section

1983 when it

19 enacted the Tax Injunction Act?
20

MR. WEHRLE:

Well, I would have to say sort of a

21 qualified yes, because at that time I think all you had in
22 the Federal Courts were injunction actions,

and I don't

23 think they thought sitting back then that somewhere along

24 the line, maybe back in 1981, that somebody was going to
25 come in and ask for damages, because what they were doing,

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in my opinion, they were putting into a statute what the
2 Federal Courts had been doing.

They were concerned, I

3 believe, about a number of things, and I think one of the
4 things they were concerned about was at that time cases
5 against local officials, but since there had not been that
6 type of action, only injunction suits, I think that is why
7 they worded it the way they did, but I think we must look at
8 the fact that it was taken after the Johnson Act, as we
9 state in our brief.

It was almost the exact wording of the

10 Johnson Act, and there is no question, I don't think, about
11 that Act being a complete bar to any case filed in a Federal
12 District Court in regard to an administrative agency setting
13 utility rates in a state, and when we look at that history
14 and see that that was the Act that the Tax Injunction Act
15 was patterned after, then Idon't think there is any
16 question, and

when we look at the report that came out of

17 the Senate and the House, they didn't just say the reports
18 say that this was an action where the Federal District
19 Courts cannot enjoin.

Theysaid this is going to apply to

20 the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts.
21

I submit that when you look at what Senator Bohn

22 said with regard to it, because he read, he was a sponsor
23 and he read from the Johnson Act in his statement to
24 Congress, and he said, this Act is patterned after that one,
25 so if we look at that history, and we look at the intent,

1 and then what the Federal Courts have done over the years
2

QUESTION;

That is the question I wanted to ask

3

you, Kr. Wehrle, about what the Federal Courts have done.

4

In their reply brief -- I haven't read the cases, but your

5

opponent on Page 16 cites some cases in which he says, in

6 diversity cases the
7

Federal Courts had rendered damage

awards prior to the enactment of the statute, and that that

8 should be taken into consideration.
9

MR. WEHRLE;

10 cases,

Judge, I think if you read those

they were applying state law.
QUESTION;

11

12 Federal

Well, but they were damage -- there was

jurisdiction to enter a damage judgment, even if it

13

was applying state law.

14

kind of law.
MR. WEHRLE*

15
16

We do not have an issue about what

They were applying state law, but I

think —
QUESTION*

17

And the objection in the Tax Injunction

18

Act was to enjoin even in diversity cases applying state

19

law.

20

MR. WEHRLE;

21

QUESTION*

22 injunction remedy,

Yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

And they limited the statute to the
because they were concerned about the

23

Federal Courts interpreting the state law and giving that

24

remedy .

25

MR. WEHRLE*

But most of those, I think you will

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 see, they called them damages.

They were refund actions,

2 but now we have some of these Circuits that actually have
3

held that the Tax Injunction Act applies even on refund

4

actions.

5

Court said that this is going to affect the tax --

6

I think it is the case out in California where the

QUESTION;

I was just questioning your analysis of

7

the state of the law at the time the statute was passed, is

8

all, and apparently there were precedents at that time --

9

10

MR. WEHRLE;
QUESTION:

There were precedents in regard to --- for Federal Courts both enjoining

11 and granting monetary relief -12

MR . WEHRLE;

13

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
-- and Congress clearly foreclosed

14

further injunctive relief, but did not, at least not as

15

clearly, foreclose --

16

MR. WEHRLE:

Not as clearly, but I think Congress

17

knew at that time that there were suits under state law for

18

state refunds, but I do not think they felt at that time

19

there was going to be, say, a civil rights action brought

20 against a state official,
21

QUESTION;

and I think that —

Well, if I understood your answer to an

22 earlier question of mine, Mr. Wehrle, you take the position
23

that the Tax Injunction Act barred not only injunction suits

24

but also, and the Congress intended also to bar --

25

MR. WEHRLE:

Yes, sir.

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION!

2 suits, don’t you?
3

-- by the Tax Injunction Act damage
Isn't that your position?

MR. WEHRLEi

Yes, sir, but see, those cases were

4 not based upon a Federal statute.

They were based upon

5 state statutes.
6

QUESTION!

But neither were the injunction cases

7 that had been previously decided.

They were also based on

8 state law.
9
10

MR. WEHRLE:
QUESTION;

Well, not necessarily.
Some of them were.

They were --

Some of them.

The

11 major difficulty that Congress was concerned with was
12 foreign corporations coming in having the advantage of
13 diversity jurisdiction and getting injunctive relief under
14 state law.
15

They didn't want that.
MR. WEHRLE;

Well, they were getting injunction

16 relief from the Federal Court, though.
17

QUESTION;

That is right.

18

MR. WEHRLE;

19

QUESTION;

That is right.
Well, these people are in Federal

20 Court , too .
21

MR. WEHRLE;

Yes, but I would still submit that

22 the Tax Injunction Act, because of Congress' intention at
23 the time, and what the Federal Courts have done, not only
24 before but since then, they have extended it.

We go from

25 injunction, to declaratory judgment, to refund, and now we

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 come to damage suits, and I submit that when we look, at the
2 cases that have been decided in your various Circuits, we
3 look at the case involving -- the Monman case, out of the
4 City of Cambridge, and we are talking about suits for
5 declaratory judgments.

When they said that declaratory

6 judgment action as well as this damage claim -- as well as
7 this damage claim -- is predicated upon the invalidity of
8 the assessment, and it is in essence an attack upon the tax
9 assessment, then they say that the Tax Injunction Act would
10 be a bar even though, even though it is brought under 1983,
11 and we look at the District Court case, the Advertiser claim
12 against Governor Wallace, that was a damage suit, strictly a
13 damage suit, and the Court found there, and let me quote for
14 just a moment from that, "The same principles which preclude
15 awarding anticipatory relief or a refund should also
16 preclude an award of damages sought in this case.”

They say

17 "The damage award Plaintiff seeks, especially its request
18 for punitive damages, still is designed to deter collection
19 of the taxes now being assessed by Defendants."
20

I think that — we submit that when we are talking

21 about this cause of action, that if it has been any
22 deterrent effect upon the assessment, the collection, or the
23 levy of taxes by state officials or by county officials,
24 because the county officials in the first instance did the
25 things they complained about, then I think that what was

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 said in Advertiser is true.

It is designed to deter the

2 collection of taxes being assessed by defendants, and we
3 submit that even though it as an eight to eight, we submit
4 that what Judge Nangle held in his decision, when he said
5 that he would in effect become an Appellate Court for
6 appeals from the local tax assessor, if he had to hear this
7 case, we submit that he is correct, he is right, and when we
8 look at the language of the Tax Injunction Act, we look at
9 the legislative history, we look at what the Courts have
10 done prior to it and since then, and we submit to this Court
11 that Judge Nangle should be affirmed in this case.
12

QUESTION:

Before you sit down, may I ask one

13 other question?
14

MB. WEHRLE:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
Is there anything in this record that

16 is put in in behalf of the Defendants to explain the reason,
17 if there is one, for the classification that they challenge,
18 that is, the distinction between new homes and older homes?
19

MR. WEHRLE:

As Mr. Newburger said, there had not

20 been a reassessment of all property in St. Louis County
21 until some time in the sixties.

The new homes, sc I don't

22 know how you look at it. Judge, but you could say the -23 actually, and so the homes were being assessed at 33 and a
24 third percent of their market value, but because of
25 inflation the value had gone up.

All homes were assessed at

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 33 and a third, and the new homes came on at their market
2 value,

and they were assessed at 33 and a third.

3

The appeal to the Board of Equalization, they

4 reduced the assessment.

Now, under Missouri law the

5 assessor is to assess property at 33 and a third, and so
6 that is why

the assessor was faced with this.

Under

7 Missouri law, I must assess property at 33 and a third
8 percent

of its true market value.

Now, even though the

9 Board of Equalization reduced that percentage last year, I
10 think
11

I must follow state law, and that is why he put it

back at 33 and a third, because he must do that under state

12 law, and the notice goes out because that gives them a

13 chance -- under state law they must be notified if their
14 assessments increase, so they would have a right, and time
15 to take their appeal to the Board of Equalization or the
16 State Tax Commission.
17

QUESTION:

Incidentally, this does not apply to

18 taxes within the City of St. Louis, this case.
19

MR. WEHRLE:

No, sir.

St. Louis County and St.

20 Louis City are two separate entities,
21

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Judge.

Do you have anything

22 further, Mr. Newburger?

23

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID J. NEWBURGER, ESQ.,

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

25

MR. NEWBURGER:

Thank you, Your Honor.

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

There are a couple of points that I would like to

2 specifically address that the Justices raised in the course
3

of the argument.

4
5

If I might, Justice O'Connor, address the question
that you asked first, don't we think that Congress really

6 wasn't thinking about injunctions,
7

are two answers to that.

8 these two cases at Page
9

I must admit that there

First of all, we have specified
16 of the reply brief, in which the

Courts quite clearly took the view that a damage action

10 could be brought.

I think that Congress could have found

11

those cases.

Whether they found them or didn't, I don't

12

know, but that leads me perhaps to the second most important

13

portion of the answer to that question, and that is that

14

Congress very clearly established the jurisdictional bar,

15

and specified with specific words what the jurisdictional

16

bar was going to be.
The jurisdictional bar was against actions or

17
18

suits, rather, to enjoin, suspend, or restrain.

19

nothing about actions for damages.

20 the

if the bar is to be extended because of policy

22 considerations,

24
25

I think the language of

statute is terribly plain, and under those circumstances

21 I think

23

It says

that it should be extended by Congress and

not the Court.
That brings me to the question that Justice
Blackmun raised.

What speculation can one have for why the

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Eighth Circuit evenly divided on the question?

And I think

2 that what -- and I, if I may, will exercise the discretion
3 to speculate myself.

I think that the telling argument that

4 makes the case terribly convincing on behalf of Petitioners
5 is that there is no precedent in the comity cases, and there
6 is no way to read the Tax Injunction Act to draw the
7 conclusion that this action should be barred.
8

The comity cases have confined themselves to areas

9 of equity.

This is not an equity action.

The Tax

10 Injunction Act, as I suggest, is plain on its face.
11 what was the concern?

Well,

Why was it a four-four split?

I

12 submit that the reason that it is a four-four split is
13 because we are raising a troublesome question.

We are

14 suggesting that the Federal Courts in some way may become
15 involved in reviewing what is going on in the state
16 assessment processes.
17

I submit that that concern, however, was

18 overstated or overworried in the Eighth Circuit for these
19 reasons.

First of all, this is not an effort to take money

20 from the state coffers.
21 individuals.

It is an action against

Second, there are all kinds of good faith

22 defenses that are available.

If we get to the merits and we

23 can't prove what we are saying, we are going to lose.
24

QUESTION;

Don’t you agree, though, that in the

25 course of your litigation, to succeed you are going to have

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to prove that the assessment was illegal, that it violated
2 the equal protection clause?
3

MR. NEWBURGER:

Two answers to that.

First of

4 all, as far as the second claim for relief is concerned, I
5 won’t have to prove that, the second claim being this
6 computer letter that automatically picked people up.

As far

7 as the first claim for relief is concerned, I will have to
8 show that the classification that occurred was palpably
9 arbitrary.
10

QUESTION:

And have a judgment of the Court that

11 it violated the equal protection clause.
12

MR. NEWBURGER:

That’s right, Your Honor, but the

13 point that I would make in light of that, when one talks
14 about our worrying about being in the state processes, if
15 what we are going for is simply a new political process or a
16 new policy process within the state, we would not undertake
17 the burden of proving palpably arbitrary classification.
18 The question, if we are going to the future policy of what
19 is going to go on to the state, we will do that in the state
20 Courts.
21

We have done that in the state Courts.
What we are saying here is that in the course of

22 going through the process of raising the question in the
23 state Courts, these people became mad at us, and they took
24 out after us, and in the course of doing that they violated
25 our constitutional rights, and we have a right under Section

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

1983 to obtain the Federal Court protection of our

2 constitutional rights if we can

show that they purposely set

3 about to violate those rights.

If we can’t prove that, then

4 we can't prevail.

We ask the Court to send us back and give

5 us our day in Court so that we can demonstrate that we can
6 indeed prove that.

7

Thank you very much, Your Honor.
