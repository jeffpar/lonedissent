CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments next

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HUNTER H. GHOLSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GHOLSONx

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9 the Court, this argument is presented on behalf of the
10 Constitutional Board of Trustees which administers and sets
11 policy for all higher learning in the state of Mississippi.
12 The case reviews a holding that any single-sex campus for
13 females is unconstitutional, absent the maintenance of a
14 single-sex campus for males.

It is not limited to any

15 narrow holding with respect to nursing programs, but it
16 applies campus-wide.
17

The defendant Board of Trustees operates eight

18 university campuses in Mississippi in different locations.
19 Seven of them are co-educationa1,

and one is female.

The

20 Board of Trustees sets the policies and decides which
21 universities may award which degrees.

22

I would like to say at the outset that we are not

23 here to perpetuate a nineteenth century finishing school to
24 teach young women needlecraft and kindergarten keeping.
25 Mississippi University for Women is a contemporary

3

1

university which tries to prepare women to meet the

2 challenges of today.

Our oponents have said that MUW offers such

3

4 programs as fashion modeling and that sort of thing.

It

5 also offers, in accordance with the bulletin which has been
6 introduced,

Air Force ROTC, computer sciences, accounting,

7 pre-dentistry, pre-medical education, pre-law, and other
8

such courses.
I think it is interesting to look for a moment at

9

10 the history

of this institution.

It was the first

11

state-supported institution for the higher education of

12

women in the country.

It was founded in 1884 after the

13 University of Mississippi had become co-educational, so it
14 cannot be said that it was founded for the purpose of
15 relegating women to some inferior school.

On the contrary,

16 as the bulletin indicates, it was the result of the efforts
17 of a woman named Salley Renault and a number of other very
18 progressive women of that era seeking higher education for
19 women.
20
21

22

The holding of the -QUESTION;

Do we know what their reason was, if

the University of Mississippi was then co-educational?
MR. GH0LS0N:

I think, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, that

23 the reason was that women perceived a special need for some
24 of them for education especially tailored to the needs of
25 women, and I would certainly say that not all women

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 perceived this need.
2 today,

Neither did they then, nor do they

but our argument is that under the theory of

3 federalism,
4 Amendment,

if it is not in violation of the Fourteenth
that Mississippi should be permitted to allow

5 women who want single-sex education to get it.
6

Now, Mississippi used to have a single-sex higher

7 educational institution for men, but that no longer exists,
8 and

I think the answer is, it no longer exists because the

9 demand no longer exists, but the demand continues for
10 single-sex education for women,

and we believe that this

11 option is Constitutionally permissble.
12

QUESTIONi

Mr. Gholson, do you know whether there

13 are many single-sex tax-supported institutions in the
14 country other than this one?
15

MR. GHOLSON:

Yes, Mr. Justice Blackmun, to the

16 extent that federal funds are granted under Title IX to all
17 single-sex institutions who fit within the exception of
18 Title IX, there are approximately
19 the country,

180 such

institutions in

and one of our concerns in this case is, what

20 will the fallout be should this Court adjudicate that no
21 single-sex institution that receives state or federal funds
22 passes Constitutional muster.

Where will the Department of

23 Education be left in the administration of funds under Title
24 IX as to which Congress has made a specific single-sex
25 undergraduate exception?

6

MR. GHOLSON:

They are there for special courses

7 such as real estate, salesmanship, and other things that the
8 university perceives to be of community interest,

and the

9 very fact that they don’t receive credit, according to Dr.
10 Kraft, is self-limiting, and there will be very few of them,

when you give credit to men,

Mr. Gholson, is a finding that the

And what level of

MR. GHOLSON:

I think, Your Honor, that Craig

1 the Court certainly stopped short of saying that all gender
2 classifications are suspect in the highest sense of the
3 word, and I would submit --

4

QUESTION;

Some mid-level scrutiny you would

5 believe is in place and in order for the review?
6

MR. GHOLSON;

Yes, Your Honor.

I think that’s

7 correct, and —
8

QUESTION;

Mr. Gholson, am I correct as to my

9 factual assumption that Mr. Hogan could have entered a
10 state-supported school of nursing at Pascagoula or at

11 Jackson?
12

MR. GHOLSON;

At Hattiesburg or Jackson or now at

13 Tupelo.

14

QUESTION;

But there were other university --

15

MR. GHOLSON;

16

QUESTION;

Yes.

-- schools of nursing open to him.

He

17 just wanted to go to one in Columbus, in his back yard.

18

MR. GHOLSON;

Because it was convenient in the

19 same way that it would have been convenient for the
20 plaintiffs in Williams versus McNair to have gone to

21 Winthrop College.

His complaint is not that Mississippi and

22 the defendant Board of Trustees will not give him a nursing
23 education, and it is not that he can’t get the best nursing
24 education that is offered by the state.

As Your Honor

25 points out, his complaint is that it is not as convenient

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 for him as he would

like it to be to receive such an

2 education.

QUESTION;

3

Mr. Gholson, does the record below

4 indicate

whether Mississippi University for Women ever

5 obtained

funds under the Nurse Training Act of 1971?
MR. GHOLSON;

6

7 such funds.

It has not, and did not apply for

That is in the testimony of Dr. Strobel, Your

8 Honor.

11 in the briefs, that Mr.

1

Mr . Hogan did not see fit to put on any testimony

2 to contradict the educational theories that were advanced in
3 the testimony of Dr. Strobel and Dr. Kraft.

Now, I don't

4 think it's necessary for this Court to adopt those

5 educational theories or to decide that the Mississippi
6 legislature is correct in affording credence to the theories
7 that womenin the 1980's can benefit from single-sex
8 education.

I think that under Parrum versus Hughes, it is

9 only necessary that this Court find that such theories are
10 not totally without reason, and therefore the legislature is

11 within its reasonable prerogative in accepting those
12 theories of education along with the co-educational theories

13 which, of course, are afforded full play.
14

I think that it is very interesting in these

15 depositions to see some of the things that Dr. Kraft and Dr.
16 Strobel said about the role and the mission of MUW.
17 Kraft said,
18 leadership

Dr.

"In the absence of males,women are assured
roles in all regards.

19 by women officers.

The entire society is led

The faculty is predominantly female,

20 showing women leadership roles."

21

He said, "We know that in our society at this time

22 there are several groups that are not readily admitted to
23 the mainstream of life in business and the professions and
24 government, and that certain measures have to be taken to
25 assure these people proper access to roles in government,

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 business, and the professions.

At this time, we still need

2 some stepping stones for women into the larger world, and I
3 think this institution can provide that stepping stone.”
4

QUESTIONS

Mr. Gholson , the Respondents claim that

5 the senior faculty at the school is primarily male.

Is that

6 true or untrue?
7

MR. GHOLSON;

Our response to that. Your Honor, is

8 that the bulletin shows that of the four vice presidents,
9 two are female and two are ma le.
10 are female.

A majority of the deans

And according to Dr. Kraft's unrebutted

11 testimony, a majority of the faculty is female,
12

QUESTION;

What is the situation as to the nursing

13 school itself?

GHOLSON;

21

QUESTION;

Is there anything in the record to that

22 effect?
23

MR. GHOLSON;

Well, the testimony of the director

24 or dean of the nursing school is in the record, as well as
25 her deposition.

1

2 school, are we not?

MR. GH0LS0N;

3
4 Honor.

No, I don't think we are, Your

I think we are talking about the entire university,

5 because the

Fifth Circuit's opinion strikes down the right

6 of Mississippi to operate MUW per se, and not the nursing
7 school.

I think that is one of the inaccuracies of some of

8 the briefs that have been filed.

I would like also to allude to Dr. Strobel's

9

10 testimony,
11

when he said that in his experience, both as an

administrator and a faculty member, he had never encountered

12 a

positive reinforcement system which seems as prevalent as

13 that on

the campus of MUW, that he firmly believes that the

14 special

needs of women are uniguely served by this

15 institution.

MR. GHOLSON:

19

May I r espond to that by saying that

Strobel testified that the results were extremely good

21 with

respect to the admission o f MUW graduates to law

22 schools, medical schools, and d ental schools,

as compared to

23 women applicants from co-educat ional institutions in the
24 area.

He also cited the work o f Dr. Tidbull and Alexander

25 Astin,

which we have mentioned in our brief, and those

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

educators have advanced those theories, that women graduates

That is undisputed in this record,

MR. GH0LS0N;

5

6 was no evidence put on

Yes, sir.

It certainly is.

There

at all to contradict the educational

7 theories that the KUW people advanced.

I think that the Title IX argument that this Court

8

9 need consider is an

interesting one, and I don't want to

10

overstate it.

I clearly am not going to argue that the

Congress can abridge Fourteenth Amendment rights and narrow

12 anybody's Constitutional rights.

that rational is enough, but my argument today

21 is that we have met Craig versus Boren every way I believe

MR. GHOLSON;

I don't think that's before the

I think the reason that Mississippi doesn't have a

5 male-only school is that the legislature came to the
6 conclusion that there was no longer a demand for it.

7

QUESTION*

Well, it is before the Court in the

8 sense that it was the theory of the court of appeals.

They

9 said that if you justify single-sex education, you must
10 provide single-sex education to the members of both sexes.

11 That was the rationale of the court of appeals.
12

MR. GHOLSON;

And our argument with respect to

13 that, Your Honor, is that Mississippi affords both sexes
14 access to all educational programs, and -15

QUESTION;

Yes, but they don't afford males access

16 to the advantages of having a single-sex educational
17 institution they can attend.
18

MR. GHOLSON;

Well, the reason we think that there

19 are not enough males who believe that they need single-sex
20 education to justify it within the prerogative of the
21 legislature.

One might, of course, analogize to Mr. Justice

22 Marshal's opinion in Fullilove, in which, if you change the
23 words "race" to "gender" and "white" to "male" and "black"
24 to "female", it is a beautiful argument for the existence of
25 MUW, because the disadvantaged male here is a member of a

HR. GHOLSONi

2

No, I would not, because that case

3 has been clearly decided,

that people who go to school with

4 only members of their own

race are denied the educational

5 opportunities. Brown versus Board of Education.

Clearly,

6 that could not be done.

The Title IX argument which I mentioned a moment

7

10 versus Goldberg,
11

most recently, I think, Rostka

this Court has indicated an interest in

deferring in certain areas to the expressed and rationed

12 conclusions of

Congress.

In making the Title IX exception,

13 it is very clear that Congress intended

Congress certainly

to appropriate money for an unconstitutional

17 purpose.
18

So, the view of Congress at least has been clearly

19 expressed in

this regard, and T wonder what the Title IX

20 fallout could be if the Fifth Circuit's opinion is permitted
21 to stand.

Will we next be facing challenges of whether we

22 have co-educational

versus single-sex dormitories, or where

23 those dormitories may be located

with respect to convenience

whether or not we could have co-educational

programs, and if a student has a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILBUR 0. COLOM, ESQ.,

H

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12

MR. COLOM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

13 the Court, the question presented for resolution to this
14 Court today is whether one nurse, Joe Hogan, will be barred
15 from receiving academic credit toward a BS degree in nursing
16 simply because he is a male.

The question is not whether

17 Joe Hogan may attend nursing classes at the university.
18 Indeed, he can attend and participate fully in classes, and
1 g theoretically he could audit a complete course load.
20 Indeed,

the president of the university said at Page 62 of

21 this transcript that he could theoretically audit a complete
22 course load.

Joe Hogan testified on Page 26 of the

23 transcript that he was told
24 classes as he
25

that he could audit as many

wanted.

The question is not whether single-sex schools are

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 per se violative of the egual protection clause of the
2 Fourteenth Amendment.

The court of appeals did not make

3 such a holding, and Mr. Hogan has never requested such a
4 ruling from any court.

5

The question that the defendants have recently

6 presented is whether this is affirmative action for women,
7 and in their brief they use specifically affirmative action
8 for women, and I would

point out to this Court that

9 throughout this litigation, and at the district court level,
10 the defendants invited the district court to use the low

11 scrutiny, the low scrutiny of Williams versus McNair.

They

12 invited the court of appeals to use that same level of

13 scrutiny.

It is only when they get to the Supreme Court

14 that they now admit that Craig v. Boren gives the proper
15 standard.
16

We never heard anything regarding affirmative

17 action for women as a purpose for the W, as they call it, at
18

the trial level.

We never heard it at the Fifth Circuit.

19 It wasn't even brought up on the petition for rehearing
20 before the Fifth Circuit, and it didn't even appear on the
21 petition for certiorari submitted to this Court.

The district judge gave us an

9 opinion using what we considered to be an improper
10 standard.

We had submitted our briefs stating what we felt

11 was the proper standard.

He apparently accepted the

12 arugment of the state that this low level scrutiny was

13 appropriate.

At that point, we felt that there was no

14 further need for us to prove, for Craig v. Boren tells us
15 clearly that the burden is on the state to justify the

QUESTION:

Under your own theory, though, didn’t

3 you support the Craig against Boren reasoning in the
4 district court?
MR. COLOM:

5

Yes, sir,

we argued the Craig v. Boren

6 standard in the district court, but the district court did
7 not accept that standard.

It adopted a low level scrutiny,

8 the rational relation standard.
QUESTION:

9

But that is a conclusion of law,

10 really, which you are free to appeal.

11

MR. COLOM:

Yes, sir, and we did appeal that,

12 based upon -- the record in the Fifth Circuit specifically
13 held that the district court applied the incorrect standard,
14 and then they proceeded to apply the correct standard.

QUESTION:

Regardless of what standard the district court

17 applied,

18

Well, isn't that just what we should do

we should simply apply the correct standard.
MR. COLOM:

Yes, sir, and I believe that is the

19 standard applied by the Fifth Circuit, which would require,
2o we believe, an affirmance,
21

QUESTION:

Does the Fifth Circuit opinion in your

22 view go beyond the relief which you are claiming?

23

MR. COLOM:

We did not file this as a class

24 action, so we have not sought relief for males as a group,
25 and that was an intentional decision by counsel.

We have

MR. CDL3M:

I do not believe it goes beyond the

7 law, but I believe it goes beyond the specific relief my
8 client seeks.
9

Your Honor, another important --

QUESTION:

Did you suggest to the court of

10 appeals, or was it part of your theory from the outset that
11 the result might be different if Mississippi had all-male
12 schools as well as all-female schools?

Or was that the

13 product of the Fifth Circuit?
14

MR. C0L0M:

We did point out, Mr. Justice, that in

15 Vorsheimer and in Williams versus McNair, and the whole line
16 of cases where single-sex schools were upheld, that they

17 were considered essentially equal.

Now, I read the oral

18 argument in Vorsheimer, and that was a major point of
19 discussion before this Court, were the two schools in
20 Philadelphia essentially equal.
21 before the court of appeals.
22

QUESTION:

We did make that argument

Yes, sir.

So the decision below wouldn't

23 necessarily apply if Mississippi did have schools for men as

25

well as for women.
MR. C0L0M:

The court used both standards in the

decision below wouldn’t necessarily outlaw that system.

6

MR. COLOMi

If Mississippi now

It possibly could, Your Honor, because

7

you would still have to have the Craig v. Boren standard

applied, because you would still have a gender

classification.

10

QUESTION:

But you could say that there was no

discrimination.

12

until you've got a discrimination, do you?

13

And you don't have to have a justification

MR. COLOMi

I understand you have to have a

15

that would have to be justified.

QUESTION:

Kell, you have to have an unequal

Mr. Gholson.

The two women who did testify with the

13 nursing school, both deans of the school of nursing, the
14 graduate school and the undergraduate school, stated that
15 the presence of men would not affect their students or their

22 nursing program.

Because our client seeks to get in the

He is a nursing — he is a nurse already

23 who is employed as a nurse, and he seeks admission to a
24 nursing program which is predominantly women, exclusively
25 women, a profession that is predominantly women.

There is

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 no need for affirmative action for women in the area of
2 nursing.

If there is any need, it is for affirmative action

3 for men.
4

Another point, Your Honor, I think is important

5 here is that the state of Mississippi has decided to set
6 aside over 3,000 seats in its school system, its collegiate
7 school system just for women, that men cannot compete for.
8 Yet these same women can compete for every other seat in the
9 system.
10

QUESTION;

Well, supposing a statement of your

11 opposing counsel is correct that Mississippi at one time had
12 an all-male university, and there is simply -- the demand
13 for it so slackened that it was no longer economically
14 feasible to keep the place open.

Now, would you say that

15 was a discrimination if it happened under those
16 circumstances?
17
18

19

MR. C0L0M;

There is no support for that in the

record.
QUESTION;

Well, assume that that was the case.

20 Treat it as a hypothetical question.
21

MR. C0L0M;

Still, this universe would be subject

22 to the same standard of scrutiny, because the enrollment at
23 the W has gone down from 3,000 to about 1,800 now, and they
24 are suffering a dramatic reduction in enrollment.

So the

25 state has chose to maintain the single-sex school but not

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 maintain the male school because of enrollment.
2

QUESTIONi

Well, is there anything in the record

3 to indicate that they have applied different criteria to the
4 women’s school as opposed to the men’s school in determining
5 whether to keep it on when enrollment is declining?
6

MR. COLOM*

Your Honor, there is nothing in the

7 record regarding the all-male school, and if it did exist,
8 it existed many, many decades ago, in an entirely different
9 context of education, and I am really unable to answer that.
10

We have highlighted in our brief the absence of

11 any evidence to support the W's affirmative action argument,
12 but I think we have clearly shown that the experts that they
13 cite would be shocked that the W uses them.

They point out

14 the leadership roles as one of the most important
15 characteristics in a single-sex school for women.

Yet of

16 the ten presidents of this college, this university, all
17 have been male.
18

The vice president for academic affairs, the dean

19 of many schools, the director of admissions personnel,
20 extended services, the library, the great, great weight of
21 leadership has been by men, and indeed, how can they provide
22 the role models that Mrs. Tidbolt points out?

The studies

23 that they have referred to have no relationship to this
24 particular school.

They are general studies about other

25 schools, primarily schools in the northeast, who had

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 entirely different purposes in their creation.
2

And I am very uncomfortable, to be frank with you,

3 to have Constitutional rights depend upon what some
4 sociologist or psychologist says, and I feel uncomfortable
5 even citing them in behalf of my client, Mr. Hogan, but it
6 has become a central issue here.

Mrs. Tidbolt did not

7 testify, and we value cross examination, because we would
8 question her analysis substantially.
9

Looking at the problem from another vantage point,

10 the inquiry as to a compensatory purpose is not even
11 appropriate until there is a showing of past discrimination
12 and continuing effects of that discrimination as to women.

13 We have -- There has been no showing by the state of
14 Mississippi, and the burden is upon them to make the
15 showing, that their system has discriminated against
16 females, and that they must take this extraordinary step in
17

18

order to correct that discrimination.
Further, they would have to show that in the area

19 of nursing, there had been discrimination against women, and
20 that the W exists to correct that past discrimination, and
21 that it is necessary to bar men from that program to further
22 that purpose.

Again, I must constantly return to the

23 record, for it was our conclusion from the beginning of this
24 litigation that the burden was upon the state to support
25 their gender classification, and every holding by this Court

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

since 1973 has said that, and clearly the state has not met

2 their burden.

If there are unique opportunities to be offered to

3

4 women in an educational atmosphere, there was no showing by
5 the state that it could not be done in a co-educational
6

environment.

All we have in the record are declarations by

7 administrators that single-sex education has some important
8

educational value.

I would point out to the Court that the

9 president of the university, prior to coming to the W, had
10

never taught females in a single-sex atmosphere before.

11

I would not consider his statements to be authoritative in

12 that area.

He was not in administration, but a scientist.
QUESTION:

13

And

May I go back for a moment to the --

14 you mentioned, I think, that your client was offered the
15 opportunity to audit as many classes as he wanted to.
16

MR. COLOM:

17

Would he have had to pay tuition to do

18 that?

19

MR. COLOM;

QUESTION:

21

if he was enrolled?

22

MR. COLOM:

23

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
He would have paid the same tuition as

Yes, sir.
So he could have done everything,

24 attended the class and all, but he just couldn’t have taken
25 the exams and gotten a degree.

That is the only thing that

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 he couldn’t do?
2

MR. COLOM;

Both my client testified to that and

3 the president of the university testified that theoretically
4 he could audit the entire course load.

He said that is not

5 practical, that the university would limit audits because
6 they are paid by the state, based upon head count, and a
7 student who is auditing is not counted for purposes of
8 funding from the state, so they would limit them for that

9 reason.

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. C0L0M<

I see.
Another argument that I think this

12 Court should treat as having little merit is that Title IX

13 somehow provides an exception to the Fourteenth Amendment.
14 I think the defendant, the state, has backed off of that
15 argument themselves at this point.

But they also suggest

16 that Congress somehow intended Title IX to constitute
17 affirmative action for women, that the exemption for women's
18 schools buttresses their argument that this is affirmative
19 action and that Congress approved of it, but the problem
20 with that -21

QUESTION:

Do you think any inference can be drawn

22 at all from the exclusion from Title IX of single-sex
23 schools?
24

MR. COLOM;

25

QUESTION:

I don’t think any
Do you suppose if Congress had thought

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that they were unconstitutional, would they have excepted
2 that from Title IX?
3

MR. COLOMt

You can draw the inference that

4 Congress may or may not be wrong
5

QUESTION;

6

MR. COLOM;

Yes.
in making that exemption.

I think

7 one clear inference can be drawn that they did not intend
8 this to constitute affirmative action for women's schools,
9 because they limited the existence of it.
10 schools then existing could continue.
11 to encourage single-sex schools.

Only those

So they didn’t want

That was an action to stop

12 them, and to allow at least those that were existing at that
13 time to continue to receive federal funds, and since this
14 Court has held in Cannon versus University of Chicago that
15 Title IX is a spending powers action by Congress, then it
16 certainly would have no application to the Fourteenth
17 Amendment, and Mr. Justice Rehnquist, writing for this
18 Court, specifically stated in the Penhurst School case that
19 Congress has to specifically invoke Section 5 of the

20 Fourteenth Amendment to use its powers under that amendment.
21

Your Honors, for the reasons we have stated, we

22 submit that the decision of the court of appeals for the
23 Fifth Circuit should be affirmed.

2

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HUNTER M GHOLSON, ESQ.,

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

4

MR. GHOLSON;

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

Mr. Colom would have us be required to prove that

6 women have been discriminated against in the United States,
7 perhaps in the state of Mississippi in particular.

In

8 response to that, I would refer to the language of Mr.
9 Justice Brennan in Frontiero versus Richardson, beginning
10 with the statement, "There can be no doubt that our nation
11 has had a long and unfortunate history of sex
12 discrimination.

It can hardly be doubted that in part

13 because of the high visibility of the sexual characteristic,
14 women still face pervasive, although at times more subtle,
15 discrimination in our educational institutions, in the job
16 market, and in the political arena."

17

QUESTION;

But, counsel, your opponent suggests

18 that that reasoning doesn't necessarily apply to the field
19 of nursing.
20

MR. GHOLSON;

I understand that, Mr. Justice

21 Stevens, is his argument, but I understand that the Fifth
22 Circuit did not decide that question, but decided that a
23 single-sex institution for women across the board must be
24 stricken unless there is a male institution.
25

QUESTION;

Would you comment just a little further

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 -- I have tried to think about it a little bit during the
2

argument -- on when there are advantages of single-sex

3

education for women, how can those advantages be preserved

4

by allowing male students to audit courses but simply

5

saying, you can't take the exams and get the degrees?

6

MR. GHOLSON*

I think the Court would be bound to

7 accept the unrefuted testimony of Dr. Kraft and Dr. Strobel
8

that the auditing that exists is a very limited program

9

which primarily takes place at night --

10

QUESTION*

Well, but I suppose it is also true

11

that the male applicants for the nursing school are limited

12

in number.

13
14

MR. GH0LS0N:

Well, as a matter of fact, the

record shows that two more have applied since Mr. Hogan's

15 application.
16
17
18

QUESTION*

But is your limitation on auditing such

that the three could not have audited?
MR. GH0LS0N*

My understanding is that the

19

professor, and the record shows this, a professor must give

20

his or her permission for a student to audit a class, and

21

auditing, while there are no specific guidelines that say

22

Y°u cannot audit a class during the regular course of the

23

day, the situation that exists is that that just doesn't

24

take place, and there is a list of every male who has ever

25

audited a course at MUW, and it is quite short, and Dr.

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Kraft says it is short because the fact that they don't get
2 credit is self-limiting, and that that distinguishes it and
3 doesn’t cause it to invade the all-female atmosphere of the
4 student body.
5

QUESTION;

Or primarily female atmosphere is what

6 you are trying to maintain, I guess.
7

KB. GHOLSON;

Yes, sir.

8

Mr. Colom indicated that we had never talked in

9 terms of affirmative action to help women by the operation
10 of MUW.

I don't think that you can read Dr. Strobel's

11 testimony or Dr. Kraft's testimony and conclude that they
12 are describing anything less than a program of very positive
13 affirmative action to help women fulfill their full
14 potential in today's society.
15

It is certainly true that, as has been mentioned

16 in the other argument, that the plaintiff stopped short when
17 he filed his suit and said, I have been excluded.

He

13 listened to Dr. Strobel, he listened to Dr. Kraft, he saw
19 the references to the educators who endorsed their theories,
20 and he did nothing to refute that.

It is interesting that

21 counsel says that these experts would be shocked if they
22 could see the W.

I know I am not here to testify, but Ms.

23 Tidbolt has been to the W numbers of times, and is coming
24 again next month, and I hope she won't be any more shocked
25 than she has been.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Gholson, does the state still rely

2

basically on the statement of purposes and goals contained

3

in the charter of MUW?

4

MR. GHOLSON:

5

was an

1884

7

10

MR. GHOLSON:

It has not been changed as such, but

legislative appropriations have been made annually, and the
programs and curricula of the institution have been

11 constantly revised.
12

And it has not been changed, as I

understand it.

8
9

That

statement of purposes --

QUESTION:

6

I certainly don't, Your Honor.

The language of the

1884

enabling Act

sounds a good bit like the kind of language this Court might

13 have used in Muller versus Oregon, which was a little later,
14 in

1908,

and it spoke of the need of women to achieve a

15 greater parity with her brother, who was the superior
16 animal, and things that were very Victorian in phraseology,
17 and not the kind of thing we would say or believe today.
18

But I think the important point is that MUW has

ig evolved with the times, and the question is, what are they
20 doing today to help women in education, and is Dr. Strobel
21 right?

I don't think you have to believe he is right.

I

22 think you just have to believe that there is a rational
23 basis for the legislature to believe that it is right that
24 an institution devoted exclusively to women can help them
25 fulfill their potential in a unique way.

By that you are not arguing a rational

MR. GH0LS0N;

3
4

No, I think we fit Craig

versus Boren, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

5

6

No, no.

But if it is so great for women, it

does help men.

MR. GH0LS0N;

8

QUESTION;

MR. GH0LS0N;

believe that, and who operate -QUESTION;

Single-sex education?

Yes.
There are those who certainly

See, that is where I have trouble.

It

is all for women, it is great for women, but it also helps

men .

MR. GH0LS0N;

Thank you very much.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

It can be argued that, yes, sir.

Thank you, gentlemen.
