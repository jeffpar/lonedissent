ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL A.

ALITO, JR., ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

I

MR. ALITOi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on Writ of Certiorari to the

10

United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

11

The issue in this case is where a former employee of a

12

military exchange who was appointed to his position and

13

subsequently discharged may sue for money damages under

14

the Tucker Act based upon an alleged contract, the

15

existence of which is inferred solely from personnel

16

regulations in effect at the time of his separation.

17

The basic facts in this case are as follows.

18

In 1962 the respondent, Arthur Sheehan, was appointed to

19

a position with the Army and Air Force Exchange Service,

20

an instrumentality of the United States.

21

regulations governing Mr. Sheehan's employment by the

22

Army and Air Force Exchange Service, AAFES as it is

23

called, were the very same regulations considered by

24

this Court in United States versus Hopkins in 1976.

prior approval for the initial discharge notice.

1

AAFES personnel regulations in effect at the time of his

2

discharge were by themselves sufficient to give rise to

3

what the court called a collateral implied-in-fact

4

contract between the Service and respondent.

5

The court also held that there was

6

jurisdiction with respect to his claims for non-monetary

7

relief, but

8
9

that question is not at issue here.

In our view, the decision of the court of
appeals with respect to respondent's claims for monetary

10

relief is clearly wrong.

11

Court's decisions in Hopkins and Testan.

12

attempt to circumvent the decision of Congress excluding

13

employees of AAFES and the military exchanges from the

14

coverage of the Back Pay Act, which is, of course, the

15

provision of federal law providing a waiver of sovereign

16

immunity for back pay claims by regular federal

17

officials -- federal employees,

18

It is inconsistent with this

I should say.

The decision of the court of appeals is also

19

contrary to basic principles of contract law,

and if the

20

court’s reasoning were widely accepted it would have

21

far-reaching and clearly unacceptable consequences.

22

The basic principles governing this case are

23

well-established and I don't believe they are disputed

by respondent.

MR. ALITO:

I think the court clearly

proceeded on the contract theory, although it relied

12

purely upon regulations.

13

regulations at issue do not create the right to recover

14

money damages in court, nor do the statutes.

15

statutes and regulations involved are the very ones that

were before this Court in Hopkins.

7

claiming among other things that his discharge violated

AAFES regulations and the due process clause.

9

In Hopkins, as here, an employee of AAFES

This Court carefully analyzed the regulations

10

governing employment by AAFES and concluded not that all

11

AAFES employees work under a collateral implied-in-fact

12

contract; on the contrary, the Court concluded that most

13

AAFES employees -- in fact, almost all AAFES employees

14

-- are appointed to their positions, just like regular

15

federal employees.

decision.

The court of appeals'

decision is also

18

inconsistent with AAFES' own regulations, even though

19

the court relied solely on those regulations in reaching

20

its conclusion.

21

in Hopkins, expressly prohibit the Service from entering

22

into an employment contract with one of its employees.

23

Yet, the court of appeals' theory was that even if the

4

And in fact, there were no facts, there are no

facts, concerning any of those matters in the record

6

because Mr. Sheehan failed to allege or even to attempt

7

to prove the existence of a contract when this case was

8

in district court.

9

Thus, since the court of appeals looked solely

10

to provisions of law and not to any facts particular to

this case, it must follow that the obligation it

of Mr. Sheehan's employment and discharge, I think it is

19

fair to say that the court of appeals’ decision stands

20

for the proposition that the mere existence of personnel

21

regulations at the time of a government employee's

22

appointment or during his tenure is sufficient to give

23

rise to a contractual relationship between the employee

and his governmental employer.

25

MR. ALIT0;

No, I don't think so.

It was --

the burden was on respondent, who was the plaintiff

He did not allege that a contract

9

employee had alleged the existence of a contractual

There, the

10

relationship. The Court of Claims held that he was a

11

contract employee because under that court's prior

12

precedence, he was not a regular federal employee.

13

thus, it held that he was a contract employee almost as

14

a matter of law.

15

And

Hopkins, for that reason, had no occasion to

16

introduce in the court of claims whatever proof he might

17

have had that he was a contract employee, in a more

18

conventional sense.

19

the Court of Claims and rejected its reasoning that he

20

was a contract employee simply because he was not a

21

regular federal employee, it was appropriate to remand

22

the case to the Court of Claims so that Hopkins could

23

adduce whatever proof he might have.

24
25

And thus, when this Court reversed

Here, Mr. Sheehand did not allege the
existence of a contract, he did not introduce any

evidence establishing the existence of a contract, and

2

he had the clear need to do so, to substantiate Tucker

Act jurisdiction which was what he claimed in the

district court.
QUESTION*

5

You say introduced evidence to show

that he was employed by contract.

8

was it actually tried?
MR. ALITO*

9

Didn't this case go

No, it was not tried, Your Honor,

10

it went off on a motion to dismiss for lack of

11

j urisdiction.
QUESTION;

12

Well then you don't ordinarily

13

introduce evidence until you get to at least a motion

14

for summary judgment where you would file affidavits and

15

so forth, or unless you get to trial.
MR. ALITO*

16

Well, that's correct, Your Honor,

17

but I believe that when jurisdiction is challenged by

18

the defendant in a case and a basis -- a reasonable

19

basis for the challenge is established -- and that was

20

done here because I think Mr. Sheehan will not dispute

21

the fact,

22

appointed employee under this Court's analysis of the

23

regulations in Hopkins.

24

25

plaintiff to establish a prima facie case of those facts

and his own complaint suggests, that he was an

QUESTION:

9

There was not even an

There is in this case, as I

remember, isn't there a claim also for reinstatement on

10

a different theory than the Tucker Act, which is pending

11

in the district court?
MR. ALITO:

12

That's correct, Your Honor, that

13

is alive and upon remand, the district court may order

14

his reinstatement if it feels that it's appropriate.
QUESTION:

15

And in that -- under your view of

16

the equitable relief that could be granted in connection

17

with the reinstatement case, could that include back pay

18

or not?

19

MR. ALITO:

It could not include back pay

20

because there has not been a waiver of sovereign

21

immunity with respect to that.

22

The theory of the Fifth Circuit was that

23

sovereign immunity with respect to claims other than

24

money damages was waived by the 1976 amendment to the

25

Administrative Procedure Act.

And since his claim for

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

back pay would be a claim for monetary relief, that

waiver of sovereign immunity would not cover those --

would not cover that claim.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF IRA E. TOBOLOWSKY, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TOBOLOWSKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
The ultimate issue to be decided by this Court

13

is, do the regulations of the Army-Air Force Exchange

14

Service, AAFES, as they apply to the termination of

15

employment of respondent, constitute part of an

16

implied-in-fact contract between AAFES and respondent,

17

to confer jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, and a

18

breach of which implied-in-fact contract waives

19

sovereign immunity in the district court.

20

The allegations in plaintiff's complaint -- in

21

the respondent's complaint now -- on file is critical to

22

the facts and determinations by this Court.

23

respondent alleges that he was first hired in 1962 as a

24

computer programmer; that subsequent, some five years

25

later, he was accepted into a program known as the

The

1

Executive Management Program, commonly called EMP.

2

The EKP program had special benefits and

3

special burdens, and these are all alleged in the

4

complaint.

5

retention priority, longer notice requirements for

6

separation, which is the procedure for termination of

7

employment, greater insurance benefits and supplemental

8

retirement benefits.

Included within the special benefits are

The EMP program also provided for special

9
10

obligations including the obligation to develop certain

11

abilities, the obligation to accept worldwide transfer,

12

and the obligation to accept terms of fully EKP

13

retirement.

14

Respondent was required to and acknowledged

15

these obligations and benefits in writing pursuant to

16

the regulations of AAFES.
For the next eight years, respondent served as

17
18

an EMP employee.

19

off duty, away from the premises of AAFES, for

20

violations of the state drug law, and in early 1976, he

21

pled guilty to four misdemeanors for violations of state

22

drug laws.

com plaint ?
MR. TOBOLOWSKY:

Your Honor, according to the

23

Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Your

24

Honor, the obligations and benefits are set out in the

25

pleadings, and there is a pleading. Your Honor, to the

1

effect that AAFES has violated respondent's rights and

2

violated the regulations in the termination of

3

respondent from his job.

4

QUESTION;

That's a conclusion, is it not?

5

MR. T0BQL0WSKY;

Your Honor, that is -- yes,

6

Your Honor.

7

substantiate what his rights are and that the AAFES

8

Commander acted as both the separation authority and the

9

termination authority, which is in clear violation of

10
11

There are pleadings, though, that

AAFES regulations.
QUESTION;

Well, in paragraph 18 you allege

12

that the actions of the Commander violated AAFES

13

regulations and plaintiff's right to a free and

14

impartial appeal.

15

Now, that doesn't sound to me like an allegation of an

16

implied-in-fact contract.

17

MR. T0B0L0WSKY;

And then, they violated due process.

Well, Your Honor, under the

18

notice provisions of Rule 8, the Fifth Circuit so

19

construed that as a breach of an implied contract.

20

Your Honor, respondent would submit to this Court that

21

the totality of the pleadings would then constitute

22

sufficient pleadings to allege a violation of an

23

implied-in-fact contract.

24

by the Fifth Circuit, and that's a determination that

25

this Court will ultimately have to make in this case.

And,

That is a determination made

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

QUESTION;

Well, are you suggesting that

2

because he may have been given more procedural

3

safeguards and protection than he would have been

4

entitled to as an appointee, that that somehow alters

5

the relationship?

6

MR. T0BQL0KSKY;

I am suggesting, Your Honor,

7

to this Court that the EMP status may very well be a

8

contract between the flflFES and the respondent, as in the

9

Hopkins case, which must be remanded back to the court

10

for further determination of the facts.

11

During the appellate --

12

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Counsel, if the court of appeals'

13

reasoning is correct, then apparently, the district

14

court or the Court of Claims would have jurisdiction

15

over any personnel matter covered by the regulations.

16

Is that right?

17

MR. T0B0L0WSKY;

Your Honor, in the facts in

18

this case, respondent is alleging that there was an

19

implied-in-fact contract arising out of the regulations

20

solely governing the termination of employment.

21

yes, Your Honor, to the extent that there are

22

regulations, then the government agency would be

23

required to follow its regulations.

24
25

QUESTION;

So,

Would you limit your theory just to

discharge procedures or to all phases of employment by

HR. T0B0L0WSKY:

Your Honor, the discharge

procedures at at -- what is issue before this Court.

4

The Court could limit it to the facts of this particular

5

case, although counsel would argue an overall policy

6

that any regulations that are in effect could be alleged

7

to be breached, and therefore give rise to jurisdiction

8

in district court or the Court of Claims.
QUESTION*

9

Well, to the extent that you’re

10

relying on use of the federal regulations as creating

11

this implied contract, isn’t it really an implied-in-law

12

contract, if there be a contract at all?
HR. TOBOLOWSKYs

13

No, Your Honor, I am not.

14

am suggesting that the Court of Appeals for the Fifth

15

Circuit is correct in its conclusion that it was an

16

implied-in-fact contract.

17

existed between AAFES and the respondent, that the

18

regulations would be the basis of termination and that

19

they would be followed, constitutes an implied-in-fact

20

contract.

21

QUESTION*

I

The tacit understanding that

But there's no way of

22

distinguishing then your client's case from the case of

25

understanding with respect to the regulations, that

MR. TOBQLOWSKY;

Your Honor, there is

3

allegations to the effect that there was special

4

obligations and benefit in the EMP program.

5

regards to termination, Your Honor, the Court may very

6

well construe this decision broadly, as would the

7

government have the Court do so.

8
9

P,ut in

In response, Your Honor, Justice O'Connor,
that in furtherance of your answer, the law is well

10

settled and as stated by Justice Blackmun in the Court's

11

decision in Morton v. Ruiz, where the rights of

12

individuals are affected, it is incumbent upon agencies

13

to follow their own procedures.

14

internal procedures are possibly more rigorous than

15

otherwise would be required.

16

This is even where the

So in addition, Your Honor, to there being

17

this tacit understanding, there is also well-established

18

law which says that federal agencies are obligated and

19

bound to follow their own regulations.

20

QUESTION;

What conduct do you rely on for the

21

implied-in-fact contract?

22

MR. T0B0L0WSKY;

All right.

Your Honor, as I

23

was stating in response to Chief Justice Burger’s

24

questions concerning why does all of the procedures and

25

regulations, what do they have to do with this matter.
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Your Honor,

the parties followed the regulations.

2

There, it is the position and contentions of the

3

respondent in this case that the government, that AAFES,

4

made an offer by setting out regulations which control

5

the rights and protections of the respondent in the

6

termination procedure.
That in fact,

7

this offer was accepted in three

8

parts.

It was accepted when he entered into the

9

employment with the understanding that the government

10

would follow its regulations; when he continued his

11

employment after he acknowledged in writing that he

12

understood these regulations; and thirdly, by following

13

the regulations himself in the appellate process.

14

all three of these constitute the acceptance of the

15

offer by the government in its regulations.

16

And then the final element, the sine qua non,

17

the consideration, is actually the benefits and the

18

burdens which are accepted by both parties in the

19

employment relationship.

20

That

Now, there is case law in which a number of

21

cases have held that regulations of federal agencies do,

22

in fact, support the contention that there is an

23

implied-in-fact contract arising out of the

24

regulations.

MR. TOBOLOWSKY:

Your Honor,

that question was

addressed by this Court itself in the Hatzlachh

11

same argument was made and the Court said that you

should look to the theory presented by the respondent in

13

this case, and that it is no concern of this Court,

15

by the respondent the court should address that issue.

If there is a valid contention

QUESTION:

They sought

But if they had recast their

18

complaint without changing any of the facts, simply to

19

say that we also have an implied contract because there

20

were personnel regulations involved, should Testan have

21

gone the other way if they'd done that?

22

MR. TDBOLOWSKY:

I believe Justice Blackmun

23

gave the hint to that in his decision when he said --

24

and if I may quote from two parts of that. Justice

25

Blackmun stated, "The respondent did not rest their
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

claim upon contract."

That's at 424 U.S. 399.

"In addition," Justice Blackmun wrote, "the

2

3

present action, of course, is not one concerning a

4

wrongful discharge or a wrongful suspension."

5

to the Court that those are clear indications that had

6

the respondent -- that those are clear indications had

7

the respondent so represented or so rested his case upon

8

contract or implied contract, that the decision may have

9

very well been differently.

10

I submit

Or, the opinion may have

gone for the respondent in that case.
I think that those two statements not only

11
12

distinguish Testan but clearly support the position of

13

respondent before this Court today.
I would also like to take a few minutes of the

14
15

Court's time and direct remarks to U.S. versus Hopkins,

16

which the attorney for petitioner contends is

17

controlling.

18

U.S. versus Hopkins is not contrary to the holding of

19

the Fifth Circuit in the case presently before this

20

Court.

It is the position of the respondent that

In Hopkins, this case granted certiorari to

21

22

resolve a conflict between the Court of Claims decision,

23

the lower case, the lower court in Hopkins, and a recent

24

decision of the Fifth Circuit in Young versus United

25

States.

The conflict resulted in that the Court of
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Claims in Hopkins had held

2

the Tucker Act was sufficient to hear claims against

3

AAFES by an employer on a breach of the implied contract
Whereas,

4

that the jurisdiction under

the Fifth Circuit, in Young versus

5

the United States, had concluded that the Tucker Act did

6

not extend jurisdiction to those particular claims.
The Court of Claims in its lower court holding

7

8

held that, or relied upon its earlier decision of Keetz

9

versus the Unite! States.

In Keetz, the Court of Claims

10

had held that AAFES employees were not federal

11

employees, and therefore, did not serve by appointment

12

but served by contract.
The Keetz decision was a pre-1970 amendment

13
14

case, and it's interesting to note that in Keetz the

15

United States government was vigorously contending that

16

AAFES employees serve by contract.

17

1970 amendment, the goverment has taken a contrary

18

position and now argues that he serves by appointment.

However, after the

Hopkins could have answered the question.

19

20

This Court remanded the case for the determination, did

21

Hopkins serve by appointment, or did he serve by a

22

contract?

23

determination by the Court of Claims, and therefore,

24

that question still remains unanswered.

25

The case was settled prior to the

I would submit to this Court that even if

1

Hopkins had been decided that in fact he served by

2

appointment, which I do not and am not willing to

3

concede in my argument today before this Court, but even

4

if it had decided that Hopkins served by appointment, it

5

would not be controlling in this case because in the

6

instant case, Mr. Sheehan, the respondent, was an EMP

7

employee.

8

decision, then this court should remand the case for a

9

determination as to whether or not an EMP employee

And if you use the logic of the Hopkins

10

serves by contract or, in fact, is also an appointed

11

employee.

12

I think the language in Hopkins is clear that

13

this Court should not make that decision without, as the

14

court says, a development of a fuller record.

15

I received last Thursday afternoon in the mail

16

a reply brief from the government, -- and I would not,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL A. ALITO, JR., ESQ.

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- Rebuttal

20

MR. ALITO;

I have a very short reply.

Your

21

Honor, first of all, the procedural deficiencies we

22

pointed out in our Reply Brief are not so much that the

23

respondent failed to utter the magic word "contract."

24

The real deficiency is that he failed to allege any

25

facts from which the existence of a contract could be
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

inferred
And when the government properly challenged

2
3

his invocation of Tucker Act jurisdiction, he failed to

4

allege or present in any way whatsoever any facts which

5

would show the existence of a contract.

6

To send this case back now for an evidentiary

7

hearing as to whether or not he entered into a contract

8

would be an empty exercise.
QUESTION:

9

Kay I ask a question on that?

10

Supposing in the next case that comes along, the

11

plaintiff alleges the facts that are in this case, and

12

then in addition has a paragraph in which he says, the

13

day I was hired, I asked the hiring officer if they

14

followed their regulations and the man said yes,

15

And he said fine. I'll be glad to work for you then.

16

Would that be a different case?
MR. ALITO:

17

I do.

I don't think that would be

18

sufficient, Your Honor.

It is expected that the

19

government will follow its regulations with respect to

20

all of its appointees, and the mere acknowledgement that

21

it will abide by the law is not sufficient to give rise

22

to a contractual relationship.
The other point I would like to make concerns

23
24

the Executive Management Program that respondent has

25

stressed.

He claims that he entered into a contract

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

because he was required to sign a written

2

acknowledgement of the conditions of entry into that

3

program.

4

there are certain special benefits having to do with

5

life insurance and other matters of

6

certain special obligations.

7

possibility of transfer

8
9

And as I mentioned in my opening argument,

hat type, and also,

Principally, the

First of all, simply signing such an
acknowledgement is not proof of a contract.

Many other

10

federal employees who certainly do not work under

11

contract are required to sign similar acknowledgements.

12

Personnel in the military, for example, must sign

13

enlistment papers, and sometimes agree to incur special

14

obligations such as an extended term of enlistment in

15

exchange for special benefits such as a preferred

16

assignment or training.

17

acknowledgement doesn't mean they have entered into a

18

contract with the Army.

19

The fact that they sign that

And second, even if those special conditions

20

of the Executive Management Program were a contract,

21

they have nothing whatsoever to do with respondent's

22

claim that his discharge was arbitrary and capricious or

23

an abuse of discretion, et cetera.

24
25

We would therefore ask the Court to reverse
the decision of the court of appeals with respect to
