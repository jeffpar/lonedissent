ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STRAUSS:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9 the Court, the issue in this case is whether a Federal
10 prisoner serving a sentence under the Youth Corrections Act,
11 who commits a crime and is sentenced to a consecutive term
12 of imprisonment as an adult, must continue to be treated as
13 a Youth

Corrections Act offender for the remainder of his

14 Youth Corrections Act term.
15

In 1974, the Respondent in this case, Mr.

16 Robinson, was convicted of second degree murder in the
17 District of Columbia.

The maximum punishment for that

18 offense is life imprisonment.

The Respondent was sentenced

19 to ten years under the Federal Youth Corrections Act, or
20YCA.

The YCA permits a Judge as an alternative to imposing

21 an adult sentence to commit an offender under the age of 22
22 to the Bureau of Prisons for a program of treatment designed
23 to correct his antisocial tendencies and restore him to a
24 normal,
25

productive, and law-abiding life.
QUESTION;

Not to fit in with a group of hardened

2

MR. STRAUSSs

That's right.

There is no

3 suggestion that Congress intended it for that reason.
4

Congress intended also that the YCA be modeled on

5 the English Borstal system, and provided as one aspect of
6 YCA treatment that YCA offenders be segregated insofar as
7 practical from other classes of offenders.
8

In 1975, while he was serving his YCA sentence,

9 the Respondent was convicted of assaulting a Federal
10 correctional officer with a deadly weapon.

The Judge before

11 whom he was convicted expressly declined to sentence him
12 under the YCA, found that the Respondent would not benefit
13 further from YCA treatment, and sentenced him as an adult to
14a five and a half year term of imprisonment.

The Judge

15 specified that this sentence was to run consecutively to the
16YCA term, and recommended that the Respondent be moved from
17 the youth facility where he had been being confined to a
18 more secure institution.
19

Two years later, in 1977, the Respondent was again

20 convicted of assaulting a Federal prison guard, and although
21 he was not yet 22, he was again sentenced to an adult term
22 of imprisonment.
23 day.

This time the sentence was one year and a

The Judge specified that this sentence was to run

24 consecutively to his other two sentences.
25

When the Respondent received his adult sentences,

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 he acquired a dual status; although he was still serving a
2 YCA term, he was also under an adult sentence.

At this

3 point, the Bureau of Prisons, following an established
4 policy for dealing with dual status offenders, began
5 treating the Respondent in prison as an adult offender.

The

6 effect of this was that the Respondent was given access to
7 those treatment programs designed for adults as opposed to
8 those programs designed for youthful offenders.
9

In doing this, the Bureau was exercising a power

10 that is possessed by correctional authorities under the
11 Borstal system, the English Borstal system, which as I said
12 was the model for the YCA.

In that system, the authorities

13 could transfer an offender from a youth institution to an
14 adult prison in a case like this.
15

QUESTION:

Mr. Strauss, just on that analogy, in

16 the Borstal system they could do that even without a second
17 conviction, couldn't they?
18

MR. STRAUSS:

19

QUESTION:

That's right.

They could do it.

Do you take the position that the

20 Bureau of Prisons could do that under the YCA if this man
21 had just been a very unruly inmate, and caused a lot of
22 trouble, but never actually was convicted of a second
23 felony?
24

MR. STRAUSS:

That is not a necessary part of our

25 argument here, because he has been convicted twice.

1

QUESTION;

Well, what is your view on that

2 question?
3

MR. STRAUSS;

Our view is that the Bureau should

4 have considerably more latitude in doing that than -5

QUESTION;

6 asked you?

But what is your view on the question I

Does the Bureau have the power to do that

7 without a second conviction?
8
9 Given

MR. STRAUSS;

The Bureau does have the power to --

the practicalities of the situation, the Bureau should

10 have the power to place him in an adult institution.
11

QUESTION;

You really don't need to rely on the

12 second conviction then to sustain your position.
13

MR. STRAUSS;

That is our position, but we do have

14 the second conviction in this case.
15
16 challenge

In

1978, the Respondent brought this action to

the Bureau's policy by filing a pro se document

in

17 the United States District Court, in which he sought to be
18 segregated from adult offenders, and to be treated according
19 to the provisions of the YCA.

The District Court ordered

20 relief, ordering that Respondent be moved to an institution
21 where he would be segregated and would receive YCA
22 treatment.
23

At the time the District Court granted relief, the

24 Respondent, because of his two adult convictions, and
25 because he had compiled an extensive disciplinary record in

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 prison, including several violent incidents, was in the
2 control unit of the United States Penetentiary at Marion,
3 Illinois.

That is the most secure facility in the Federal

4 prison system.
5

QUESTION;

And as of January, this all will be

6 moot.
7

MR. STRAUSS;

That's right. Justice Marshall.

As

8 of January, he begins his first adult sentence.
9

The Seventh Circuit affirmed the District court's

10 order, and on our petition this Court granted certiorari.
11

The Respondent relies on the provisions of the

12 YCA, which prescribe segregation and treatment for YCA
13 offenders.

The segregation requirement, as Respondent

14 virtually concedes, and as, in any event, this Court has
15 said and the legislative history demonstrates beyond any
16 reasonable doubt, was intended to allow the Bureau to
17 insulate YCA offenders from the corrupting influence of more
18 hardened, experienced adult offenders.

The Respondent is

19 precisely the sort of offender from whom YCA offenders are
20 supposed to be segregated.
21 sentences.

He is under two adult

He has been in prison since he was 17, and his

22 terms will not expire until he is 31.

He has committed

23 three violent felonies, and he has an extensive disciplinary
24 record.

This is just the sort of offender Congress had in

25 mind when it decided that YCA offenders should, insofar as

2

QUESTION:

But I gather, Hr. Strauss, that there

3

is nothing in the legislative history to show that Congress

4

ever contemplated this situation, is there?

5

HR. STRAUSS:

That's right.

In fact, it seems

6

reasonably clear that Congress did not contemplate this

7

situation.

QUESTION:

On the face of the statute, it might

appear that he is entitled to YCA treatment.

10

HR. STRAUSS:

QUESTION:

13
14
15

Well, the language —

On the face of the statute it seems

that way, doesn't it?
HR. STRAUSS:

It is essentially unenlightening.

We do not suggest that it supports our position directly.
QUESTION:

It is rather explicit, it seems to me.

16

But in any event, in any event, I gather your argumenmt is

17

that we can forget what the statute says, and just in

18

contemplation of what Congress had in mind, this is not the

19

kind of chap who is supposed to get YCA treatment.

20

HR. STRAUSS:

Well, when the language of the

21

statute is essentially not addressed to this problem, and

22

leaves us where we started, then we have to —

23

QUESTION:

Your argument seems to be that it would

24

defeat the purposes of the statute as explicitly declared by

25

Congress, if they were to put him with other young youth

QUESTION;

By regulation.

21

MR. STRAUSS;

That's right.

The statute

22 authorizes it, but the Bureau of Prisons has established
23 it.
24

One problem. Justice Marshall, to answer your

25 question, is that in several lower Court decisions

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 constraints have been put on the Bureau's power to place
2 troublesome YCA offenders in maximum security institutions,

HR.

STRAUSS;

At this time, thereis not.

Does that depend on the outcome of this

MR. STRAUSS;

No, it does not.

It depends on the

And the budget.

10

MR. STRAUSS;

11

QUESTION;

No doubt, the budget.

Mr. Strauss, may I ask

12 Under the Youth Corrections Act,

you a question?

I suppose it is possible

13 that the youth offender will serve a longer period of time
14 in custody than if he were an adult, for example.
15

MR. STRAUSS;

16

QUESTION;

MR. STRAUSS;

That is right.

That is possible,

right?
Under a different

18 provision of the Act from the one under which the Respondent
19 here is sentenced.
20

QUESTION;

Right, and if that is the case, and the

21 theory of upholding that kind of a provision was that the
22 youth offender would be getting special treatment

, so there

23 is a quid pro quo, in effect, is that not right?

MR. STRAUSS;

That is the theory that some Courts

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTION;

Then, if the Bureau of Prisons can

2 transfer someone in the middle of a youth offender sentence
3 to an adult facility, then you lose that quid pro quo, don't
4 you?
5

MR. STRAUSS:

6 Justice O'Connor.

Well, that seems to be right,

The quick answer to that concern is that

7 Mr. Robinson, the Respondent here, was not sentenced to a
8 longer term

than an adult would have received.

9 could have received life imprisonment.
10 ten years.

An adult

He was sentenced to

So, whatever those concerns are, they are not

11 present in this case.
12

QUESTION:

But wouldn't our holding here cause

13 major concerns in future cases if that happened to be the
14 situation?
15

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, that would, of course, depend

16 on the contours of the holding.

As for the other cases, I

17 would point out that the argument is by no means decisive,
18 because what offenders in YCA custody are entitled to is
19 what Congress gave them, and if we can establish that
20 Congress did not intend that this program would survive
21 beyond the point where is served any purpose, then it can't
22 be said that they are being denied or deprived of something
23 that Congress intended them to have.
24

QUESTION:

May I follow up with that?

Is it your

25 view that the second trial judge at the time of the second

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 offense could have imposed a concurrent sentence instead of
2 a consecutive sentence, which would then have authorized the
3 Bureau to treat him as an adult rather than a YCA offender?
4

HR. STRAUSSi

Yes, if the second judge -- you mean

5 the judge who sentenced him to his first adult sentence?
6

QUESTION;

Yes.

7

MR. STRAUSSi

If he had

imposed a concurrent

8 sentence, I would think there would be no
9

QUESTIONi

question.

Couldn’t theDepartment of Justice

10 pretty much take care of the problem by asking for
11 concurrent sentences whenever a YCA offender commits another
12 felony?
13

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, it could.

Of course, that

14 actually points out a paradox in the situation, that an
15 offender whose crime was not sufficiently serious -16

QUESTION;

It can't get the benefit of the longer

17 YCA sentence that Justice O'Connor adverted to it it did
18 that, of course.
19

HR. STRAUSSi

That's right.

Also, he wouldn't get

20 the benefit -21

QUESTION;

What he wants to do is get the benefit

22 of the length of the YCA sentence but not the quid pro quo.
23

HR. STRAUSSi

Well, he wants to impose a

24 consecutive sentence essentially, the adult sentence to go
25 on top of it.

The paradox is that consecutive sentences

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 ordinarily

denote a more serious offense, and the lower

2 Court's decision -3

QUESTION:

So they want the additional time, and

4 they also want to change

the character of the first

5 sentence.
6

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, the Judge decided the

7 additional time was necessary,
8 also to change
9

and that makes it necessary

the character of the first sentence.

QUESTION:

Well, it doesn't make it necessary.

10 Under the Department’s

policy it is desirable to change the

11 character of the first sentence.

MR. STRAUSS:

12

13 necessary.

Well, that's right.

It is not

It is not something we are required to do.

In

14 our view, it is necessary in order to maintain Congress'
15 intention in enacting the statute.
16

The other point about the segregation requirement

17 is that, as

Justice Rehnquist pointed out, and as Justice

18 Blackmun, in three months'
19 his adult sentence,
20 that he

time, the Respondent will begin

and at that time it is beyond dispute

will be an adult offender, and no one would contend

21 that at that time he can claim a right to be segregated

from

22 adults or placed as a YCA offender, but there is no basis
23 for thinking

that he is somehow less of a corrupting

24 influence now than he will
25 he is more fit to be placed

be three months from now, or that
with YCA offenders now than he

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 will te in three months.
2

QUESTIONi

Well, any decision the Court is going

3 to make is going to apply to someone who might have nine
4 years left, or a longer period.
5

MR. STRAUSSt

That is right, but I think the same

6 point still holds, that there is no basis for believing that
7 at the earlier point, after he has committed a crime and
8 sentenced as an adult, that somehow he will not become a
9 corrupting influence until that sentence begins to run.
10

The other provision of the YCA on which the

11 Respondent relies is the treatment provision, and again, the
12 Courts below have applied this provision to the kind of
13 offenders for whom Congress did not intend it.
14 treatment in Congress'

YCA

view was designed, as Justice

15 Rehnquist suggested in an earlier question,

to return

16 offenders to productive lives in the community, and to that
17 end an integral part of the treatment Congress envisioned
18 was a gradual phased,

supervised reintegration of an

19 offender into society.
20

At the end of his YCA term however, the

21 Respondent, of course, will not be returned to a productive
22 life in society.

Instead, he will begin two adult prison

23 terms, and for that same reason it will be impossible
24 gradually to reintegrate him into society.

So, an integral

25 part of YCA treatment as Congress saw it will not be capable

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of being afforded to this Respondent.
2

Nothing in the Act suggests that YCA treatment is

3 preparation for a life in prison, and nothing in the Act
4 suggests that the custodial phase of YCA treatment followed
5 by an adult prison term will do anyone any good, society or
6 the offender.

It is at least plausible that a custodial

7 treatment program designed to culminate in an offender’s
8 return to society when followed not by a return to society
9 but by an adult prison sentence will do even the offender
10 more harm than good.
11

So, if anything, it thwarts Congress’ intention to

12 attempt to provide Respondent with YCA treatment.
13 Certainly, there is no basis in the YCA for requiring the
14 Bureau of Prisons to provide treatment to an offender such
15 as this.
16

QUESTION:

I think you have answered this, but

17 there would be no question if either one of these two Judges
18 had said YCA, would there?
19

MR. STRAUSS:

If the Judge had imposed YCA

20 sentences, he would be a YCA offender.
21

QUESTION:

22

MR. STRAUSS:

That is right.

And there would be no problem.
He would still be a YCA offender.

23 There would be no basis for claiming he is an adult
24 offender.

I would point out that, as Justice Stevens

25 suggested earlier, if his prison record were very bad, it

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 might be

necessary to take some steps that would require

2 confining him in conditions comparable to those of an adult
3 offender, but the Bureau would

still regard him as a YCA

4 offender.

QUESTION:

5

It is up to the Judge, not to the

6 Department of Justice.

MR. STRAUSS:

7

To decide whether someone is a YCA

8 offender or an adult offender.

Our view is that the proper

interpretation of the statute remains, that Congress did not

adult

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Strauss, are you suggesting to my

11

brother White that without a second conviction, just because

12

of misbehavior, the policy of the Department would permit

13

their treating him as an adult, even though he had been

14

sentenced as a youth offender?

15

MR. STRAUSS:

There may be some circumstances, in

16

our view, under which a YCA offender is such a problem, the

17

only practical way to deal with him is to place him in an

18

adult penitentiary.

19

QUESTION:

Well, that is the Bureau’s presently

20 published policy, isn't it?

MR. STRAUSS:

That is the Bureau’s present policy,

22 and it is one that --

QUESTION;

Well, if we were to do that, we would

10 be answering a question that this case doesn't present.
11

MR. STRAUSS;

12

QUESTION;

That's right.

Ordinarily, isn't it the case that if

13 you take a person 23 years old off the street and try him
14 for a crime and the Judge sentences him to 20 years, he
15 begins serving that sentence as soon as the Trial Judge
16 directs, or as soon as his appeals are exhausted?
17

MR. STRAUSS;

18

QUESTION;

That is my understanding.

And here, of course, he begins serving

19 the adult sentence after the YCA sentence expires.
20

HR. STRAUSS;

21

QUESTION;

That's right.

If there was a ten-year YCA sentence,

22 as there was here in 1974, and say in the first trial, the
23 first offense was in 1975, and the Trial Judge gave him one

24 year, as he did the last time, it is your view that that
25 one-year adult sentence would entitle the Bureau to give him

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 ten years of adult treatment, isn't it?
2

MR. STRAUSS:

That one-year adult sentence, in our

3 view, would make him an adult offender, yes.
4

QUESTION:

And then the whole ten-year sentence

5 could be treated as an adult sentence.

MR. STRAUSS:

That's right.

Mr. Strauss, would the government

Well, that would be a difficult

It would depend on the nature of the affirmance.

3 It would be difficult —
4

QUESTION:

Well, I am just talking about an

5 affirmance.
6

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, this offender has two adult

7 sentences for serious crimes in prison.

It is hard to see

8 how someone could be more unruly than that.

So to that

9 extent it would be a problem.
10

QUESTION:

That is true, but you think an

11 affirmance here would prevent the Bureau under its present
12 policy from confining him as an adult?
13

MR. STRAUSS:

QUESTION:

15

MR. STRAUSS:

Again --

If we affirmed.
Simply, if you simply entered an

16 order of affirmance, I suppose it would be possible to carry
17 out the other policy, but as I said, it is difficult to see
18 how this offender can be -- can assert a right to continue
19 the YCA treatment unless any unruly YCA offender could.
20

QUESTION:

The argument is, that is what the Act

21 says.
22

MR. STRAUSS:

23 the Act says or intends.

Well, in our view, that is not what
I should also point out that the

24 Bureau's policy that we have been talking about of placing

25 unruly YCA offenders in adult conditions applies only to

The YCA forms of treatment, the characteristic

2 forms of education and counseling made available to youths

be available to them.

Essentially the problem

4 is that he would have to be put in some place like the

unit at Marion,

where he is under very close

16

HR. S0L0VY*

What do these two convictions mean?
All right.

Well, let's take -- the

17 government says that Mr. Robinson is a hardened criminal,
18 and he must be kept in the most maximum confinement
19 possible, namely Marion, but yet when Mr. Robinson wound his
20 way up to the Seventh Circuit, the Bureau of Prisons started
21 thinking about its obligations,

and they transferred him to

22 the Memphis facility, which is a minimum

-- a medium

23 security, and then to Butner, which is an administrative
24 f acility.
25

Now, at Butner we lodged with the Court his

1 up serving five to seven years for an offense that if he
2 were sentenced as an adult he could only be imprisoned six
3 months, and that would be an anomalous result.
4

Under the Congressional scheme, it doesn't matter

5 what pattern of sentences occur.

If a youth at the age of

6 18 commits a robbery and gets a one-year adult sentence,
7 then gets in trouble again before the age of 22, he can get
8a YCA sentence.

This Court has mandated that a Judge make a

9 no benefit finding.

But the question of what the Bureau of

10 Prisons could do, whether they could yank a man in and out
11 of his status as a YCA offender, Mr. Strauss referred to the
12 Borstal system.

Well, the Borstal system was plainly

13 explained to Congress, including the power to take a person
14 from a youth facility and put him in a penal institution.
15 Congress did not adopt that suggestion.

They explicitly

16 left it out.
17

When the initial Act was proposed in 1943, the

18 American Law Institute proposed that the Bureau of Prisons
19 be given the authority to determine YCA status.
20 Judges in America screamed about that.

All the

That was rejected.

21 Then they proposed that the Judges and the Bureau of Prisons
22 share these powers.

That was rejected.

And what you had

23 was a system in. which only the Trial Court could impose a
24 YCA sentence.

25

Now, bear in mind, in Dorszynski, this Court held

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that that determination of the Trial Judge is not reviewable
2 by this Court.

Now, what the Bureau of Prisons is saying is

3 that either they can countermand the judgment of the initial
4 Trial Judge or that the second Trial Judge could do that.
5 Now, if this Court could not review a YCA sentence, then
6 certainly the Eureau of Prisons could not do it, nor could
7 the second Trial Judge, nor did the second Trial Judge in
8 this case intend or pretend to countermand the Youth
9 Corrections sentence.

20 agonized over what the correct answer is, and correct not in
21 the manner of espousing our position but intellectually and
22 legally correct.
23

QUESTION;

The question is, the question in this

24 case is whether the later conviction automatically
25 terminates the youth sentence, wholly aside from any

Cr does it give some

But not yours.

11

MR. SOLOVY:

14 otherwise you would be having the discretion of two Trial
15 Judges in conflict .

16 the second Judge gives a consecutive sentence,

I know, but he nevertheless says at

MR. S0L0VY:

Justice White, I don't think those

the youth offender

QUESTION:

Well, that is the clear -You go ahead on your concurrent

13 sentence —
14

MR. S0L0VY:

All right, but that is the clear

15 answer under the Congressional Act.

However, as to the

16 concurrent sentence, now you have two Courts of equal
17 jurisdiction, and the second Court says, for this offense,
18 wish to impose a concurrent adult sentence

Now,

I

19 point out the Bureau —
20

QUESTION:

And he says no benefit.

21

MR. S0L0VY:

No benefit.

22 according to their statistics,

The Bureau of Prisons,

they say they have in the

23 youth corrections facilities 175 persons who have
24 consecutive and concurrent sentences so although the Bureau
25 of Prisons -- it doesn't make any difference to them because

1 they mix adult and youth offenders up all together, so it
2 makes no difference, but they treat them as a youth
3 offender.

I think the answer is that that person can be

4 immediately incarcerated as an adult offender, because the
5 second Judge has exercised his discretion that this person
6 should be immediately incarcerated as an adult, and I think
7 the question is not without its difficulty, because the
8 first Judge made a determination that the offender would

They are both Judges

The first Judge cannot veto the

MR. SOLOVY:

What Congress had in mind, it is very

22 clear th at if someone had the time, as I had, to read the

24 Congress had in mind was that there was going to be a big

MR. SOLOVY:

Poor Mr. Robinson, as I say, at the

3 end of the first year of his ten-year YCA sentence, he gets
4 this adult sentence.

The Bureau of Prisons says, it is all

5 over, Mr. Robinson.

No more Youth Corrections treatment,

6 which you never got in the first place, but you are not
7 going to get it.

And you are going to -- they concede his

8 YCA sentence is going, so therefore you will serve your full
9 eight years before you get your conditional discharge, but
10 as for your adult sentence, you get no credit whatsoever,
11 and that is why the government and the Bureau of Prisons is
12 so nervous about this case, because really you cannot say
13 that it makes penological sense to keep Mr. Robinson
14 incarcerated for eight years under the Youth Corrections Act
15 and not give him the treatment that Congress mandated, and
16 at the same time house him in Marion as an adult offender
17 with the hardest of criminals in the nation, and say, you
18 don't get your good time credits, you don't get your time

QUESTION;

MR. SOLOVY;

4

QUESTION;

Correct.
Do you think the Judges across the

5 country are aware of the fact that a concurrent sentence
6 will terminate the youth offender sentence?
7
8 that.

MR. SOLOVY;

I think the Trial Judges are aware of

What they are not aware of, Justice White, is that

9 the Judge found in Watts versus Hadden that the Youth
10 Corrections Act is a myth, and that this system does not
11 exist, because if you ask the Trial Court Judges what is
12 going to happen to their youth offenders when they are sent
13 to the facility, they think they will be segregated from
14 adult offenders, they think that they will receive
15 rehabilitative treatment.

They don’t think they are going

16 to be mixed with adult offenders who are going to enforce
17 peace and quiet, because that isn't the intention of the
18 Judges.
19

And I am surprised that the Bureau of Prisons,

20 with the state of litigation that is going on, in Brown
21 versus Carlson, Watts versus Hadden, Johnson versus Bell,
22 where they are being told continuously to bring your
23 performance within the Congressional mandate -- I mean, it

24 is 32 years later -- that they would have the temerity to
25 bring this case before the Court and say, defer to our

5

QUESTION;

And that comes under the Act of

MR. SOLOVYs

Yes, it comes under the Act of

We feel that if the government does not like the

9 way this Act operates, if they want to run the Youth
10 Corrections Act the way they want to run it as against the
11 way Congress said it should be run, if they think that it is
12 proper to mix adult offenders with youthful offenders,

then

13 we believe that that question should be put before Congress,
14 and it should not be put before this Court, as this Court
15 stated in Dorszynski.
16

If the Court should hold that this second sentence

17 somehow revoked Mr. Robinson's youth offender status, then,
18 as we set forth in our brief, you have serious
19 constitutional issues of equal protection, double jeopardy,
20 and due process.

We do not believe that the Act has to be

21 interpreted in a manner which raises those issues.

We

22 believe that the Seventh Circuit was clearly correct that
23 the Third Circuit, which had issued these wonderful
24 decisions in this area up to Thompson versus Carlson, was
25 incorrect in its ultimate premise.

U6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

In Thompson versus Carlson, the Third Circuit

2 clearly said to the Bureau of Prisons, you cannot
3 unilaterally revoke this man's status.
4 within your power.

You do not have it

As much as the Bureau of Prisons would

5 like to have that power, they do not have it.

The Courts

6 have uniformly held that, other than the Fourth Circuit's
7 decision in Outing.

That is the only decision, and an early

8 decision in Abernathy, which I do not think adequately
9 addressed the issues, but all the other Courts have said,
10 including Thompson versus Carlson, you do not have that
11 power.

Thompson versus Carlson said, though, that the

12 second Judge in imposing the sentence terminated the first
13 youth corrections sentence, and we believe the Seventh
14 Circuit was clearly correct in holding that that was not the
15 effect of the second sentence.
16

Indeed, the consecutive adult sentence may have

17 been imposed in Hr.

Robinson's case, as the Seventh Circuit

18 pointed out, precisely because he was serving then a youth
19 corrections sentence, and the Court might have imposed a
20 youth corrections sentence otherwise.

Justice White, the reason that the Judge's

3 sentencing an offender to a concurrent adult sentence
4 doesn't solve the problem is, of course, the Judge might
