Mr. Schultz, I think you may proceed when you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN SCHULTZ, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. SCHULTZ;

First would be that allowing one patient to refuse
treatment is necessarily going to negatively impair the

14 state's ability
15 maintaining
16

to perform its legitimate objective of

order in its hospitals, and second of all, of

treating those patients who are not themselves refusing

17 treatment.

In other words, what I am saying is that to

18 allow one patient
19 necessarily be

to refuse treatment, there will

an increase of violence in our institutions.

The First Circuit talks about allowing forced

20
21

to be the two fundamental reasons

that there is no constitutional right to refuse treatment.

The second point that I want to make as to this

I could say that maybe less people will be

There is no doubt that the First

Circuit opinion in our mind is less wrong than the district

7

Well, they did give you a broader

first fundamental reason is that if you allow one patient to

12 remain in your hospital in a deteriorated

state, this is

13

going to affect the health of other patients, whether or not

14

there is violence.

15

you have patients who are deteriorated, this will set off

17 more later.

The second major point that I want to discuss in

18

19 argument today which

we believe to be a second fundamental

20 reason is that we suggest that the original decision to
21

commit an individual against his will for treatment purposes

22 when it is known at

the time that the patient is committed

23 that antipsychotic medications are a

of this medication against the patient's will after the

2

commitment.
In other words, let me just reword what we consider

this basic argument to be all about.

10

should be empowered to carry out that treatment against the

11

patient's will which was ordered at the time of commitment.

12

In order to fully understand these two fundamental

13 arguments that

we believe necessitate there being a finding

14 of no right to refuse treatment,

I think it is first

15 necessary to focus very, very briefly on what exactly is the
16 role of

antipsychotic medications in our state hospitals.

17 The record in this case is clear that antipsychotic
18 medications are a

necessary part of the treatment for the

19 vast majority of seriously mentally ill

antipsychotic medications for those patients.

QUESTION:

Mr. Schultz, do you disagree with the

10

district court’s findings about the drugs themselves, that

11

they are mind-altering and they have significant side

12

effects and so forth?

13

MR. SCHULTZ:

I certainly disagree with the finding

14

that they are mind-altering.

As for the effects, the side effects, there are

The one other point that I can point out about the

3

side effects is that there has sort of been a pendulum in

5

6

was a side effect, and now they are finding that the side

effects are more limited than they thought, and are

8

certainly more treatable.

9

At first there wasn't

Then everybody thought everything

Let me turn back to the question of what these

10

medications are all about.

11

want to emphasize is not only is the record clear that these

12

medications are effective when taken voluntarily; the record

13

is also overwhelming that these medications are effective

14

when forcibly administered, the district court's finding

15

notwithstanding.

16

A point which the defendants

There is no way — To argue that these drugs are

17

not administered -- are not effective when administered

18

forcibly simply ignores the tens of case histories in this

19

case of patients who refused antipsychotic medication and

20

deteriorated, and then against their will were forcibly

21

medicated and improved, and there is simply no explanation

22

for that other than the fact that these are chemicals, and

23

they make the brain — they restore an imbalance, and this

24

balance is restored whether or not a person voluntarily

25

takes these medications or whether a person is forced to
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

take these medications.
Let me turn to what the Commonwealth feels is

2
3

another very important point in this case, and that is the

4

recognition that we are talking about seriously mentally ill

5

individuals, as the patients who have been given the right

6

to refuse medication, and specifically, what do we know

7

about the serious mental illness which is sufficient to

8

commit an individual?
We know that an acutely psychotic patient is

9
10

terrorized, in a state of panic, unbearable agony, pain, and

11

distress.

12

schizophrenic patients, which are the majority of patients

13

for whom it would be a proper practice to give antipsychotic

14

medications, don't think rationally, that they think on

15

their own autistic terms.

That is undisputed in the record.

We know that

We know that a classic symptom of mental illness

16
17

which leads these patients to being committed is

18

ambivalence, including ambivalence to treatment.

19

that — it is undisputed in the record that many, many

20

patients who were forcibly medicated in the past, after they

21

were forcibly medicated, thanked the doctors for forcibly

22

medicating them when they weren't speaking their own true

23

mind.

24

Now, despite --

25

QUESTIONi

We know

Could I ask you one question —
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. SCHULTZ;

2

QUESTIONS

Certainly.

-- about the basic facts that I just

3 didn't recall as you are developing your argument.

The

4 institution houses both voluntarily committed and
5 involuntarily committed persons.
6

MR. SCHULTZ:

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. SCHULTZ;

Is that correct?

That’s correct.

What is the rough proportion of the two?
I believe it is 90 percent voluntary

9 and around 10 percent involuntary.

The reason for that is

10 that in Massachusetts the laws changed in 1970 requiring you
11 to, even if you could commit somebody, ask them if you
12 wanted them to come in voluntarily, because they felt there
13 would be a benefit to patients being voluntary patients.
14 There is not necessarily much of a difference in the
15 illnesses between the two.
16

QUESTION;

Do I correctly recall that those who are

17 voluntarily committed do have a right to refuse this

18 treatment?
19

MR. SCHULTZ:

Or leave the hospital, or face a

20 petition for their commitment.
21

QUESTION:

But as a matter of fact, is something

22 comparable to the district court or the court of appeals
23 procedure being followed with respect to the 90 percent who
24 are voluntarily committed?
25

MR. SCHULTZ:

Yes, except that many of them — it

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

used to be felt that you could ask them to leave the

2

hospital and if you didn't you could forcibly medicate

3

them.

Now what is happening is, after this opinion, if you

4 feel they have to be forcibly medicated,

they are making

5 them involuntary patients.

So when the patient refuses

6 medication now, there could

well be a shift in this

7

percentage,

8 Circuit
9

and the district court issued would have become the

law .
I simply don’t know the statistics as to whether or

10
11

given if the kind of opinions that the First

not there has been a change over the last several years.
QUESTION:

12

In any event, basically what is at issue

13 here is whether you must follow with respect to the
14

percent, because presumably the number would grow by reason

15 of
16

10 plus

the circumstances you describe, whether you must follow

the same procedure with respect to them that you follow with

17 the other patients in the hospital.

MR. SCHULTZ:

18

I am afraid I don't understand your

19 question.
20
21

QUESTION:

Well, the court has ordered you to

follow certain procedures before you involuntarily

22 administer these drugs to the 10 percent who have been
23 involuntarily committed.
24

MR. SCHULTZ:

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And as I understand it,

you are applying

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 those procedures, or substantially those procedures, as to
2 the 90 percent of the people in the hospital.

So the

3 question is whether the 10 percent must be treated like the
4 rest of the patients.
5

MR. SCHULTZ;

Well, what they are doing with the 90

6 percent is saying, you have a choice of leaving, if you
7 want, and if you don't, we are going to make you an
8 involuntary patient.
9

QUESTION;

Well, I know, but if they don't leave.

10

QUESTION;

If you could.

If you could.

You may

11 not be able to.

12

MR. SCHULTZ;

13

QUESTION;

That is correct.

That is correct.

Mr. Schultz, I would like to pursue

14 something that may be somewhat similar to Justice Stevens’
15 question.

As I understand it, the court of appeals required

16 that an individualized estimation be made by the physicians
17 in attendance of the possibility and type of violence in

18 which the patient might engage, and the likely effects of
19 the particular drugs on the patient, and an appraisal of the

20 alternative means of treatment, and then if the physicians
21 determine, having applied that standard, that the drug
22 should be given, it may be given involuntarily.
23
24 said.

Now, I think that is what the court of appeals has
I also believe that that is the procedure that you

25 have outlined in your brief that you assert the state

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 follows anyway
2

Is that right?

MR. SCHULTZ:

No, that is not right, because what

3 they — first, what the court of appeals has done is, they
4 set up two procedures for what they call dangerous patients
5 and non-dangerous patients.

What happened before the

6 temporary restraining order, there was no decision about
7 dangerousness.

It was recognized that this was not

8 something which was predictable necessarily for these
9 patients.

It was decided whether or not the medication was

10 medically necessary on an individual basis, but there was
11 never a decision made on, do I believe that because the
12 possibility of dangerous outweighs the individual’s private
13 rights, which is what the individual decision has to be
14 according to the First Circuit, that decision wasn’t made.
15

Yes, it was an individual determination, but the

16 questions that were asked were guite different.
17

I want to go back to the point of who these

18 patients are, because I want to talk briefly, because the
19 state, I think, has been misconstrued on this point in both
20 courts below, on who is this competent mentally ill patient
21 that is talked about by the two courts below.
22

The district court found that a majority of the

23 committed patients are capable of appreciating the benefits,
24 the risks, the side effects of these medications.

The

25 Commonwealth suggests simply there is absolutely no basis in

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the record for that finding, but putting that aside, the
2 major problem with both the district court opinion and the
3 First Circuit opinion in this respect is that nobody
4 discusses what they mean by such terms as appreciate,
5 benefits, competent, or capability.
6

And it is quite one thing to say that a patient is

7 able to understand that there may be risks to medication and
8 to understand that he has been told he will get better if he
9 is given the medication, and it is quite another thing to
10 say that a seriously mentally ill patient can appreciate the
11 benefits of being well when by definition part of his
12 illness is that he doesn't understand that what he is is not
13 well, and let me make the Commonwealth's position clear here,
14

We are not stating that a petition of commitment is

15 the same as a legal finding of incompetency.

We recognize

16 that people may be delusional in some aspects, but
17 clearheaded in other aspects of their life.

18

QUESTION*

What does Massachusetts require to be

19 found in the case of a commitment?

20

MR. SCHULTZ*

At a commitment there must be a

21 finding of mental illness, there must be a finding of a
22 serious risk of harm to an individual by reason of mental
23 illness.

Serious risk of harm is defined as three types of

24 patients, danger to others, danger to yourself, or
25 incapability of taking care of yourself.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Let’s look at those three kinds of patient.

1

You

2 talk about the kind of patient who is a serious risk to
3 himself.

This patient by definition, if he is going to be

4

committed, is seriously depressed, his affect is impaired,

5

he feels that there is really -- he doesn't understand that

6 there is a better world.
7

He feels usually that the only way

out is by killing himself.

8 not

Now, certainly, this patient is

going to be able to understand the benefits of what it

9 means to be

well, because in his world the whole world is

10 bleak.

Look at the second kind of patient •

11

The second

12

kind of patient is a patient who is a danger to others.

13

This person by definition has basically -- has a distorted

14

view of interpersonal relations with somebody.

15 he is either in
16

Classically,

a state of rage or he is in a state of

panic, a rage at somebody or a panic that somebody else is

17 going

to hurt him.

18 wane on

Yes, the rage and the panic may wax and

a given day or in a given period, but the basic

19 underlying

problem of his illness is that he doesn't

20 understand

that his rage or panic is unreasonable, and there

21

is no way that patient can weigh the benefit of what the

22 medication is going
23

QUESTION;

24 appeals opinion,
25 this element

to be -Well, counsel, under the court of

if the physician determines that there is

of violence which is a possibility, and as you

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 have indicated, to commit the person in the first place the
2 court had to decide that violence was a substantial

3 possibility, I don’t understand why the court of appeals
4 requirement adds anything in addition to what the doctors
5 would be looking at anyway.
6

MR. SCHULTZ;

What the court of appeals does is

7 require — they say that the fact of violence at the time of
8 commitment is not enough to later forcibly medicate the

9 person in the hospital.

They say that dangerous on the

10 outside may not mean dangerousness on the inside.

And they

11 set up this arbitrary distinction of, you can forcibly
12 medicate some people if you think they are violent, and

13 forcibly medicate other people if what you want is treatment.
14

What the Commonwealth says is, everybody is

15 committed for treatment.

It is simply not accurate to say

16 that there is anybody in Massachusetts hospitals because
17 they are dangerous.

That is not why they are there.

They

18 are there because they are dangerous by reason of mental
19 illness.

20

QUESTION;

Well, here, the court of appeals gave

21 alternative standards.

It said that the petitioner -- the

22 hospital may forcibly administer drugs without a finding of
23 incompetence if it is reasonably believed to be necessary to
24 prevent further deterioration in the patient’s mental health
25 or the other standard that I have been talking to you about.

Medical judgment.

Well, if the courts

said to you, well, you have two groups, the ones you use

and the ones you don't, if you decide that a certain

10 person belongs in the group that you are going to give drugs
11

to, you should go through a procedure to decide that.

MR. SCHULTZ;

Well, let me answer that in two ways,

This case is not a procedural case, is my first
This is not a case where you are simply talking

The First Circuit is talking about changing the

10

defense puts it, demand hotel service instead of treatment,

11

and refuse their medication.

12

They are talking about another group of patients

13

that is going to be set up that just didn’t exist before,

14

which is a group called incompetent patients but for whom

15

there is going to be a substituted judgment that if they

16

were competent they should be allowed to refuse, and those

17

patients are going -- somebody else is going to be allowed

18

to say, they should be allowed to refuse their medication.

19

It has nothing to do with setting up -- this is not the

20

procedural question.

21

The First Circuit opinion doesn't even mention

22

procedural due process.

This isn't an opinion which talks

23

about the state's rights and the individual rights and the

24

need to have some type of mechanism which will lead to an

25

accurate assessment, which we would suggest in our brief the

Are the patients' desires concerning

15

MR. SCHULTZ;

The record shows that they are.

That they would listen to the

17 reasons that the patients gave as one factor they would

take

18 into account.
19

QUESTION;

And do the physicians consider the

20 dangerousness of the patient or
21

MR. SCHULTZ;

the propensity for violence?

Before, not -- not really.

I mean,

22 dangerousness is part and parcel of the mental illness.
23 Yes,

they considered it to the extent that because these

24 people are mentally ill,

because some of them certainly have

25 a history of dangerousness,

that these patients need

treatment, but I cannot honestly say that dangerousness was

2 one of the factors that they took into account.
3

What they took into account was whether or not

4

these particular patients needed the antipsychotic

5

medication.

QUESTION*

And they consider the alternative forms

of treatment for medication?
NR. SCHULTZ*

There is not an alternative form of

treatment for most of these patients.

I mean, I cannot

10

honestly tell you that they went through — we have proposed

11

remedies in this case, where the other side suggests under

12

the doctrine of least restrictive alternative there are 12

13

other alternatives that must always be considered, one of

14

them being seclusion, which they suggest is less restrictive

15

than forcible medication.

16

The doctors did not do that.

Would the doctors prescribe antipsychotic

17

medication if they didn't believe that was the best

18

treatment?

19

of the alternatives, but it was not a matter that they said

20

to themselves, which is the least restrictive form of

21

treatment that could be given.

No.

And to that extent, it is a consideration

22 to themselves is,
23

Instead, what they would say

what is the best form of treatment that

they could be given.

One other point that I want to emphasize that I
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 think both courts below simply have misinterpreted what
2 parens patriae power and what police powers are all about.
3 Police power is talked about in terms of a policeman's
4 ability to prevent dangerousness, and the defendant suggests
5 that simply is not what the police power is.

The police

6 power, according to past cases in this Court, is the ability
7 to protect the general welfare, including to protect the
8 public health of its citizens.
9

The Commonwealth would suggest that this ability to

10 protect the public health is clearly implicated when you are
11 talking about the need to treat patients against their will
12 who have already been committed against their will for
13 treatment purposes.

As to the parens patriae power, I

14 simply want to say that this notion of competency seems to
15 have been invented by the First Circuit to justify its
16 opinion.

You will find nothing in the opinions of this

17 Court that ties this variable competency that can change in
18 one day, where one day you are competent and one day you are
19 not competent, to the parens patriae power.

The state is

20 the sovereign, as a sovereign is the guardian over all
21 idiots and lunatic, according to the opinions of this Court.
22

This Court has never mentioned incompetency.

This

23 notion of incompetency, the Commonwealth would suggest, is
24 one that has been brought in from the rear to justify the
25 opinion.

It simply is not necessary.

The parens patriae

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 powers and the police powers are more than adequate to
2 justify the actions taken by the doctors in this case.
3

Thank you very much.

QUESTION*

Mr. Schultz, does the record show

5 anything about the adequacy of staffing in these hospitals?
6 We hear a lot of complaints over the country about
7 understaffing, insufficient number of psychiatrists and
8 other attendants.
9

Does the record show anything here?

MR. SCHULTZ*

It shows that they were half of what

10 you might find in a private hospital, where they were
11 compared to McLean Hospital in Boston for the comparison in
12 staffing.

They were far above the minimum standards that

13 were set out in such cases as Wyatt.
14

QUESTION*

I gather from your remarks, these

15 frequent sessions and the like, that there was no problem
16 with staffing.
17

MR. SCHULTZ;

The staffing could have been better,

18 but it is not a question of there were not doctors, there
19 were not good registered nurses, there were not residents.

20 I mean, that kind of staffing was there.

21

QUESTION:

Before you sit down, let me put one at

22 you that we have got you stopped.

I get a feeling reading

23 this record, the massive record, this case went on how many
24 weeks?

25

MR. SCHULTZ:

It was a year and a half of trial and
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 74 -- I guess 72 trial days and two days of closing argument.
2

QUESTION:

I get a feeling, and I wonder what your

3 reaction is, whether I am being led astray, that the
4 as we judges tend to do, were

judges,

reading this testimony in this

5 record as though mental illness, psychiatric problems, are
6 like physical illness, that you can take someone's
7 temperature or pulse or blood

test and then you know

8 something about what is going

on inside that person.

Is

9 that a strange reaction that I get, or would you -10

MR. SCHULTZ:

No, I think that is certainly there,

11 and I think that goes to this problem of the inability to
12 predict the violence of some patients, the unawareness that
13 people who do not think rationally are going to act
14 impulsively on those irrational thoughts.

There is simply

15 no recognition by either judge of those particular problems.
16

QUESTION:

A diabetic patient, for example, if he

17 is getting near diabetic coma, they can find that out by a
18 blood test, can't they?

But you are saying that you can't

19 do that with the psychotic or the schizophrenic.

20

MR. SCHULTZ:

I don't want to overstate it.

21 are certainly many patients you cannot do that for.

There
There

22 are some patients that might have a clear history that if
23 they do something, they do something first.
24 that something else almost always follows.

Then you know
Then you have a

25 history showing you for those psychotic patients that when
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 they start winding up you have got to look out, the next
2 thing they are going to do is punch somebody.

But if you

3 don't have that kind of history, certainly you have that
4 problem .
5

QUESTION;

Hr. Schultz, I take it there is a

6 regular procedure at these hospitals for periodically
7 determining if the grounds for commitment still exist.
8

MR. SCHULTZ;

9

QUESTION;

That is correct.

So that presumably in between — just

10 take a particular patient, Mr. A.

In between the times that

11 his case is reviewed for that purpose and the next time it
12 is reviewed for that purpose, presumably he still fits the
13 definition of a proper committee, that he is either
14 dangerous to himself or to others or can't take care of
15 himself.
16

MR. SCHULTZ;

That's correct.

There is an

17 affirmative obligation on the superintendent to release a

18 patient who is no longer mentally ill or felt no longer
19 mentally ill and dangerous.

In addition to that, there is a

20 six-month periodic review and then another six-month
21 periodic review at the beginning, then they are yearly after
22 the first six months, and in addition, there is what is
23 known as a Section 9 petition, where any time the patient
24 himself wants to petition the court, he can do so.

25

QUESTION;

So we are talking about -- the court of
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

appeals is talking about saying you must determine -- you

2 must get the consent of someone who right now is dangerous
3

to himself or to others or can't take care of himself.
MR. SCHULTZ*

4
5

10
11

they say the finding is

dangerousness on the outside, not necessarily what is on the

8 inside.
9

I mean, what they

say, without, we suggest, any real support, is that once you

6 are in the institution,
7

That is correct.

We say the finding is dangerous because of mental

illness, and that they are just missing the point of what
the mental illness does to the individual.
QUESTION*

12 for commitment,

Well, if they don't qualify any longer

they should be turned loose.

13

MR. SCHULTZ*

14

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Mr. Schultz, the opinion in this case is

15

based, of course, in part on the fact that in Massachusetts

16

someone can be an involuntarily committed patient and under

17

Massachusetts law is still competent legally to make a

18

variety of decisions.

19

MR. SCHULTZ*

Is that not true?
All Massachusetts law says is that

20 you are competent to do some very specific things,
21

write a

will, manage your affairs.

22

QUESTION:

Dispose of property.

23

MR. SCHULTZ*

That's right.

It says nothing about

24

that you are competent to make treatment decisions.

25

a gloss that the First Circuit and the district court

That is

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

opinion have put on the Massachusetts law.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. SCHULTZ:

4 to

Can they vote in Massachusetts?
Yes, they can.

But again, this goes

-- we accept that somebody may be delusional in some

5 areas and not delusional in other areas.

QUESTION:

6

Well, part of the decision here may be

7 affected, may it not, by this provision of Massachusetts law
8

providing that they continue to be legally competent, right?
MR. SCHULTZ:

9
10 think

I don't think it should be.

I don’t

-- one, competency is relevant, as I have discussed,

11

competency is a variable thing, so that you can be more

12

competent one day than the next day, and really what is

13 relevant is

why you are committed.

14 Massachusetts law,

I think, is clear.

15 a right to refuse treatment.
16 specifically that there is
17 and

Beyond that,
It does not recognize

It sets out in the law

a right to refuse electric shock

lobotomy, and does not mention antipsychotic

18 medication.

I think under normal rules of statutory

19 interpretation the right interpretation of Massachusetts law
20 is

that it does not recognize the right to refuse treatment

21 with antipsychotic medication.
22
23 question?

QUESTION:

Mr. Schultz, may I ask you one other

Apart from procedures that have been adopted in

24 response to this litigation

— just assume we didn't have

25 the case -- does the record tell us

whether the hospital

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 draws any distinction in its day to day administration
2 between voluntarily and involuntarily committed patients?
3

MR. SCHULTZ*

They did not before this suit except

4 to the extent that for the voluntary patient they would say
5 you can leave, but if they didn't, then they treated them
6 like involuntary patients, without bothering to commit.
7

QUESTION*

8 right to leave.
9
10

The voluntary patient always had the

Is that right?

MR. SCHULTZ*
QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor.

I see.

But other than that, in terms o

11 medical decisions and the like, they are treated alike?
12

MR. SCHULTZ*

13

QUESTION;

That's correct.

Mr. Schultz, we have been taking your

14 time that you wanted to reserve to reply, and perhaps the
15 Court will give you additional time.
16

You have not responded to the motion of the other

17 side that we dismiss this case in light of the court's
18 decision in your state in Roe.
19

MR. SCHULTZ*

Well, I have certainly responded by

20 brief.
21

QUESTION*

You did briefly, but that is a rather

22 important issue, at least for me.
23

MR. SCHULTZ*

Well, I can do no more than really

24 repeat what I think are the basic points in our brief, so I
25 will do that very briefly, if you would like.

I think the

QUESTION:

Without going into that detail, let me

5 ask you this.
6

MR.

SCHULTZ: Okay.

7

QUESTION:

Do you think the Poe decision changed

8 the law of Massachusetts in any way?
9

MR.

SCHULTZ: It is hard to say, because the Roe

10 decision deals with a moot situation which is never going to
11 come up again, and I really don't think the Roe decision is
12 going to have any impact whatsoever in Massachusetts.
13

QUESTION:

You think it is totally irrelevant to

14 this case?
15

MR.

SCHULTZ: Absolutely.

16

Thank you.

21

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD WAYNE COLE, ESQ.,

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

23

MR. COLE:

Thank you.

24

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I

25 would like to try to clear up two comments that were made at
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the end of the argument in terms of commitment.

The Roe

2 case specifically dealt with whether or not merely because

3 someone is being committed for dangerous in the community,
4 dangerousness in the community, whether it means that a
5 person would be necessarily dangerous in the hospital, the
6 Supreme Judicial Court said specifically it does not mean,

7 and I will give an example of that.
8

Someone may be dangerous to their family because

9 they are having problems with their family, and they are
10

dangerous, and they are put in the hospital.

11

cannot be discharged, because if they are again discharged

12 into the community,

Now, they

they would be dangerous in the

13 community, does not necessarily mean that they would be
14 dangerous in the hospital.
15

In fact, the district court found as a matter of

16 fact, based on the evidence presented by the defendants,
17 that only 25 percent of the patients in the hospital are in
18 fact potentially dangerous, and I will address that later.
19

Second of all, in terms of the practice dealing

20 with voluntary patients, they were treated specifically like
21

involuntary patients.

22 weren't told

What happened was that patients

that they had a right to leave.

They were told

23 that if they refused their drugs, they would be forcibly
24 medicated, and that if they tried to leave, they threatened
25 them with commitment.

So there wasn't such a thing that
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 --

they are called conditional voluntary patients, where

2 the patient has to give three day notice to the hospital,
3 and during that period of time the hospital has the right to
4 petition, and the record was consistent in the patients who
5 testified and staff who testified that patients were
6 threatened that if they did refuse and they tried to leave,
7 that they would attempt to commit them.
8

I would like now to go to certain brief points

9 concerning this case.
10

QUESTION:

11 the record.

Well, let me ask you one question about

Does the record indicate what happened in the

12 event that there were commitment proceedings?

Were the

13 patients who refused treatment invariably committed?
14

HR. COLE;

15 concerning that.

There was nothing in the record
Host patients, at least the testimony that

16 we have from staff and patients was that the patient would
17 not sign the voluntary -- or withdraw the voluntary under
18 the threat of commitment.

But there was no record

19 concerning what was the rate of

those individuals who

20 refused and whether or not they would be committed.
21

First of all, I would like to make the point that

22 respondent in this case had never sought to restrict the use
23 of antipsychotic drugs

on individuals who were able to weigh

24 the risks and benefits of these drugs and who voluntarily
25 agreed to take them.
33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION

You say they are able to weigh it

2

MR. COLE;

That is correct.

3

QUESTION;

Who says they are able to weigh it?

4

MR. COLE;

The district court found, based on the

5 evidence that was presented below, that most patients in the
6 hospital as a matter of fact were able to weigh the risks
7 and benefits of the drugs, specifically and particularly
8 those patients who had experienced antipsychotic drugs
9 before.

Now, 85 percent of the patient population were

10 either patients who were chronic patients or patients who
11 had been rehospitalized previously, and one can assume by
12 both the evidence in the case and as petitioner says that
13 almost all those patients had antipsychotic drug experience
14 in the past.
15

Secondly, this is not a situation in which if

16 patients are provided with the right to refuse antipsychotic
17 drugs, that many patients will be without treatment.

Now,

18 the petitioners have here asked for de novo review of a
19 number of facts found by the district court after a 72-day
20 trial, a voluminous record with testimony which -- some of
21 it was in dispute, but which the district court found -- but
22 the district court found, and based on -- by statements made
23 by the defendants themselves, that the vast majority of
24 patients after the district court order accepted some form
25 of antipsychotic drug, though not necessarily the drug or
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

dosage the doctors originally prescribed, as long as the

2 doctors tried to use discourse to discuss with
3 the risks and benefits

the patient

rather than the previous practice of

4 using force on the patients.

Now, this was a different practice, and the

5

6 defendants admitted,
7 the defendants’

there are admissions in the record that

practice in the past was for patients, some

8 patients who were able to make rational decisions,
9 would

that they

ignore or disregard patients' complaints about the

10

adverse side effects, and medicate them anyway because the

11

doctors believed that it was in their best medical interest.

12

Secondly, the district court found that a number of

13 effective alternatives are available to the hospital for
14 those competent patients who refuse antipsychotic drugs.

QUESTION:

15

What does the district court know about

16 these things, any more than most judges know about the
17 processes that go on in a medical hospital?

MR. COLE:

18

Well, Your Honor, there was substantial

19 testimony from a number of national experts on both sides
20 concerning alternatives --

QUESTION:

21
22 to

And this should be ultimately relegated

the decision of one district judge, or of a court of

23 appeals, or, for that matter, this Court?
24

MR. COLE:

Well, the fundamental question in this

25 case is,

we perceive as a fundamental historic right in our

QUESTION*

What percentage of these people are

5 competent adult persons, of these inmates?
6

MR. COLE*

Well, Your Honor, first of all, the Roe

7 case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, the highest
8 state court, specifically said that patients are competent
9 to make treatment decisions even though committed, so in
10 their interpretation of state law —
11

QUESTION;

All of them?

All of them?

12

MR. COLE*

No, Your Honor.

We don’t believe that

13 all of them are, but as the Roe case said, and as the
14 district court and the court of appeals said, that for those
15 patients who are unable to weigh the risks and benefits,
16 there is a state procedure present, and in fact, the
17 petitioners followed that same state procedure for medical
18 treatment for those same patients, the surgical treatment
19 for those same patients, and for psychosurgery and
20 electroshock.
21

That means that if -- that they either have to get

22 the consent of those same patients who are in the hospital
23 who they say they don’t have to get for antipsychotic drug
24 treatment, and if they believe they are incompetent, that
25 they have to go to the probate court to get an adjudication

of legal incompetency before they can be forcibly treated

2

for medical treatment, surgical treatment, electroshock and

3

psychosurgery, and this treatment could be ongoing also.

4

For example, medical treatment could for the same

5

patient be ongoing and involves drugs also, the drug, for

example, dilantin, phenobarbita1, dealing with seizures.

7

They are ongoing.

in those circumstances.

Mr. Cole, I understand your view that

10

there is a great difference between being committed for

11

statutory reasons and being mentally incompetent.

12

your view that the test of incompetence for things such as

13

making wills and voting and entering into contracts should

14

be precisely the same as the test for competence to make

15

this medical decision?

16

MR. COLE:

Is it

Your Honor, the answer is, each type of

17

situation for competency to vote, for contracting, are all

18

individual legal determinations that are made by courts of

19

law in Massachusetts traditionally.

In fact, dealing with --

1 another area.

But in terms of medical treatment, the same

2 procedure follows the state case that we cited in court
3 dealing with Lane versus Candura, where a doctor believed
4 that a patient who was going to -- refused surgery, and the
5 doctor believed the patient was incompetent, and they went
6 to court, and the court says, even though the doctor
7 believed that the decision by the patient was unwise and
8 foolish, and maybe even incompetent, that in fact she was
9 still legally competent under Massachusetts law.

And the

10 Roe -11

QUESTION»

Under Massachusetts law, is the test of

12 competence merely one of the intellectual ability to know
13 what is best for oneself, or does it also require something
14 to do with the kind of self-discipline that might be
15 necessary to make the decision?
16

MR. COLE:

I think the Massachusetts law, though,

17 it is not clear, is that if a person understands and is able
18 to weigh the benefits and risks of the type of treatment,
19 even though -20

QUESTION:

Some people weigh the benefits and risks

21 of stopping smoking, but then they go ahead and smoke.
22

MR. COLE:

Our society believes that an individual

23 has a fundamental liberty interest in making certain
24 decisions except for in certain extraordinary situations.
25

QUESTION:

The test is really an intellectual test.

MR. COLE:

That is correct.

Could I ask you, say

here is a

3 particular person who is involuntarily committed , and there
4 has been the proper finding that he is either dangerous to
5 himself or to others or he can't take care of himself by
6 reason of mental illness, and so he is committed, and the
7 judge has found that he is in that condition.
8

MR. COLE:

The finding is only that the

9 mentally ill and dangerous if the person

person is

remains in

the

10 community, but there is not a finding that the person is
11 mentally ill and dangerous in general.

That means it will

12 follow the person.
13

QUESTION:

What if it is found that he cannot take

14 care of himself by reason of some mental illness?
15

MR. COLE:

That is the third category.

16

QUESTION:

Yes.

17

MR. COLE:

That is the inability to care for

18 themselves in terms of the basic necessities of life.
19

QUESTION:

That is the same, in or out.

MR. COLE:

Excuse me?

That is the same, inside or outside.

MR. COLE:

That's correct.

difficulty understanding.

He might be very competent, but

20 can you be competent to refuse treatment

that the doctor

wants to administer to keep you from hurting others?
MR. COLE;

Okay.

In that situation, the court of

appeals directly addresses that circumstance.

In a

situation where a person — and the respondents have always

25

conceded this — that even if a person is competent in a

by

Then

10 competency is beside the point?

MR. COLE*

Under the -- what the court of appeals

12 is saying is that because a patient is not necessarily
13 dangerous in the institution, in fact, in terms of violenc
14 there are only, according to the petitioner's testimony,
15 approximately 25 percent had the potential for violence,
16 that all the doctor has to do is, if the doctor makes an
17 individualized assessment -- that is all we are asking -18 that that particular patient creates a danger to self or
19 others at that time, then the state has a legitimate
20 interest in overriding the competent individual's right to
21 refuse.
22

And so that is correct.

The fact is, if that was

23 the issue, and all they had to do was that, the petitioner

What reasons

3

MR. COLE*

Well, if I can first begin to answer by

4 saying that the first thing we take is that these drugs are
5 extremely dangerous drugs.
6

QUESTION*

I understand that.

7

MR. COLE;

These are not relatively risk-free

8 drugs.

And what we are saying is, in an individual who is

10 is a potential for harm in the institution, number one, and
11 who is not causing the kind of security problems which
12 belong to the police power —

QUESTIONS

So why is he giving it?

17 that the state -18

QUESTIONS

And you suggest that even if those are

19 the reasons, and valid ones, nevertheless the patient should
20 be, if he is competent, should be able to say, sorry, I
21 don *t care to take it?
22

MR. COLEs

That's right.

That is particularly

23 important in this case, because we are not talking about
24 relatively risk-free drugs.

We are talking about a drug

25 which the district court found that 30 to 50 percent of the
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

patients are getting a syndrome called tardive dyskinesia,

2

which is the deforming, often irreversible and untreatable

3 symptom that causes patients to have facial contortions and
4 grimaces, to have lip-smacking and tongue protrusions that
5 can't be controlled by the patient, that when this syndrome
6 gets fully manifested patients find that they cannot speak,

7 that — and speech becomes incomprehensible, swallowing and
8 breathing are impaired as well as all motor activity.

11

Now, if this was only 1 or 2 or 3 percent of the
patient population involved —
QUESTION;

12 should say,

So the patient, if he is competent,

well, I would rather be the way I am than be

13 that other way.
14

MR. COLE;

That’s correct, and we are saying that

15 -- we are not saying this for all treatment.

We are saying

16 that there are particular types of treatment, such as
17 psychosurgery, electroshock, that raise such fundamental
18 interests in terms of what these drugs can do.

The

19 petitioners say these drugs don't affect the mind.
20 the district court found
21

Well,

-- there was substantial evidence

in this case -- that these drugs can blunt the

22 consciousness,

impair cognition, learning ability,

23 problem-solving ability.
24

MR. COLE;

Mr. Cole, none of the plaintiffs in this

25 case suffered any of these effects, did they?

So, we are not talking about if there is bad

3

QUESTION*

The difficulty with your argument that I

4 see, at least, is that the more difficult it is to
5 accurately appraise the risk, it seems to me the less wisdom
6 there is in saying that the layman should make the medical
7 judgment.
8

MR. COLE:

What we are saying is, is that the

9 patient is the one who has to assume the risk of this
10 irreversible side effect, and a competent individual should,
11 just like other competent adults in our society -12

QUESTION*

But even a competent doctor apparently

13 can't appraise it accurately.
14

MR. COLE*

Well, the question is not whether -- one

15 can competently say that 20 to 50 percent of patients over
16 the long term who are taking these drugs are getting tardive
17 dyskinesia.

That is a risk that one can understand.

One

18 can't selectively say that this particular patient is going
19

to get it.

Just like when someone has an operation and the

20 doctor says there is a one in 100 chance of death, they
21 don't know if specifically that one person is going to be
22 the person who is going to die.

Of course, that person

23 wouldn't take the therapy.

time, as I recall
MR. COLE:

Well, the record reflects that within

3 three months of antipsychotic drug treatment, there have
4 been reports that patients have had tardive dyskinesia.
5 Within a year of antipsychotic drug treatment, the patient
6 is at high risk.

Now, you have to remember that a number of

7 these patients have been on antipsychotics in the past.
8 are not talking about one year straight.

9 about one year.

We

We are talking

Eighty-five percent of the patient

10

population are either chronic patients or patients who are

11

being readmitted to the hospital who have had prior

12 hospitalizations,

and therefore have taken antipsychotic

13 drugs, so the risk is great for that 85 percent immediately
14 if they have had any history of antipsychotic drugs.
15

QUESTION*

But you would apply the same procedures

16 Justice White asked you about where the man is dangerous to
17 himself and so forth, you would apply the same procedure
18 whether the patient has ever had the drug before or whether
19 he has been using it for ten years.
20
21
22

MR. COLE*

That’s correct, because that is not the

only side effect that a patient experiences.

No, but this is the more serious one, as

23 I understand.

to refuse

we believe that

there is a liberty interest involved, and the court of

10 appeals attempted

to weigh the strong patient’s interest and

11

the institutional interest, and we feel that the weighing

12

was responsible, giving due deference to the state and the

13

institutional needs, but at the same time recognizing the

14

dangers of these drugs and the important patient's interest

15

in being able to refuse, especially considering that we are

really talking about and focusing on patients who the

to make these rational treatment decisions.

They may have to litigate forever.

3

MR. COLE;

Well, Your Honor, that is a risk.

4

However, an example of this situation was in our case, where

5

the court, district court found the defendants violated the

6

state seclusion statute, and knew or should have known that

7

they violated it, but they were not held liable because the

8

court said they couldn’t have anticipated that they violated

9

the statute, and even though they made a mistake, the court

10
11

found that they were not liable.
So, we are not talking about a situation --

12

whatever standard we are going to use, whether or not -- if

13

we are going to use a standard of that doctors can only

14

treat when they think it is necessary, the doctors can be

15

sued by patients if the patient believes it is not

16

necessary.

17

as long as they act in good faith, even if they are

18

mistaken, they can’t be held liable.

19

That is always the risk.

Whatever the standard,

Massachusetts passed a statute and said that a commitment of

this kind, even if accompanied by a finding that this kind

of treatment may be in the best interest of the patient, and

MR. COLE:

Our belief is that that would be

unconstitutional.

Mr. Cole, would you clarify for me your

position as to the constitutional right that may exist for

who is incompetent by court

MR. COLE;

6

Our view is that this Court need not

7 reach the constitutional issue because there is a
8

state

procedure that is available and the Supreme Judicial Court

9 of

Massachusetts in Roe says that that is the procedure to

10

follow in that situation.

11

should apply the state procedure dealing with that.

12

Our view is that this Court

In terms of what we believe is constitutionally

13 due, our view is that competency is a legal determination.
14 It has been in every context in our society, including
15 medical care.

It has been in Massachusetts, certainly, both

16 in the Secowitz case,

Or have the effect of incompetence by

MR. COLE:

I believe the American Psychiatric

Association tries to indicate -- indicates in its brief that

there are certain states -- I don't think there are a lot of

6 states that have that finding, and

they recognize that

Massachusetts is not one of those states that actually have

that finding in their brief.

10 the mental illness problem,
11

what happens if a patient

develops an attack which the hospital physician diagnoses as

12 possible ruptured appendix that should be operated on

Do they have to get the consent of the patient?

MR. COLE:

14

No, Your Honor.

That is an emergency

15

situation, and the Attorney General of Massachusetts wrote

16

an advisory opinion to the Department of Mental Health and

17

said that surgery of individuals who are committed, that

QUESTION*

8

Was there any expert testimony as to the

9 percentage of serious schizophrenic patients who ever get
10 well?

MR. COLE;

11
12

I don't believe there was -- there was

medical articles dealing with comparing patients who were on

13 antipsychotic drugs versus not using antipsychotic drugs.
14 But there wasn’t any percentage of the number of patients —
15

QUESTION:

Wouldn't it be very important for any —

16 if judges are going to get into this business, wouldn't it
17 be important to know whether certain categories of mental
18 illness are treatable and have any possibility of recovery
19 and some are not?
20

MR. COLE*

That is certainly known, isn't it?
That's correct.

There was testimony

21 concerning the rate of improvement with
22 and

antipsychotic drugs

without, dealing generally, not dealing with the

23 particular wards here, in general, and it was -- for
24 example, the chief of pharmacology of the Department of
25 Mental Health testified that at most, 50 percent of
59

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

schizophrenic patients benefit from antipsychotic drugs,

2

benefit, improve at all.

3

QUESTION;

That is different from being cured.

4

MR. COLE;

Improve at all.

And in our brief we

5 indicate what the different kinds of — what improvement
6 means,

and that improving could be limited to the extent

7 that someone may at that point be able to cloth himself.
8 That is considered improvement,

but as this doctor said, who

9 was the chief psychopharmacologist, that approximately 50
10

percent of patients with schizophrenia improve at all on

11

antipsychotic drugs.

12

QUESTION;

Was there any expert testimony that

13 pointed out that a great many patients who show improvement,
14 not a cure, but an improvement in the protected environment
15 of a hospital nevertheless are not subject to release
16 because if they are out of that protected environment, with
17 all the stresses of outside life, they would regress?

Was

18 there any testimony along that line?
19

MR. COLE;

20 Your Honor,
21

There was testimony concerning that.

that even though someone may improve, it doesn't

mean that they would be released necessarily.

22 the limited

Improve in

sense that they would be released.

23 Approximately 50 percent of the patients in this hospital
24 were long-term patients, were long-term chronic patients.
25 That was testified by one of the -- Dr. Gill, I believe,
60

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

that approximately 50 percent were long-term patients.

2

QUESTION;

Mr. Cole, may I ask just one other

3 question about your constitutional theory?

I take it your

4 claim of a constitutional liberty interest here is limited
5 to the case in which there is this kind of very serious
6 permanent damage?

But you make the same claims, to the

7 patient, assuming a competent and non-dangerous person, to
8 refuse less severe treatment, such as flu shots or an
9 exercise program or something he just didn't want to do.
10 You wouldn't contend he had a -11

MR. COLE:

No.

I think there is a distinction.

12

QUESTION;

But a non-committed person would have a

13 right to refuse those things, I suppose.
14

MR. COLE;

Well, I think we are talking about a

15 balancing test that this Court has used with institutions,
16 and what we are saying is that situations which deal with
17 conditions of confinement, that there is a different test
18 than dealing with fundamental intrusions.
19

QUESTION:

Used as non-punishment.

20

MR. COLE:

Used as non-punishment, but that involv

21 fundamental liberty interests.

What we are saying is that

22 it is —

QUESTION;

For it to be a constitutional violation

24 are you taking the view that it has to be viewed as a form

program, he is overweight or something.
MR. COLE;

12 of confinement,

I think that would be termed a condition

where as long as there was a rational reason

13

for the state to do that, that -- what I am trying to

14

distinguish between those — there is a balancing test in an

15

institutional setting, and that when a treatment crosses the

16

line, electroshock, psychosurgery, maybe antipsychotic

17

drugs, cross that line --

18

QUESTION;

Crosses what line?

19

MR. COLE;

Crosses a line in terms of raising a

MR. COLE;

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

liberty.

The question is, does the state have the ability

2 to override that in
3

an institutional setting.

That -- the

analysis is, our view is that in a situation where it is so

4 intrusive that

the state in many situations doesn't have the

5 legitimate interest

to overcome that general right, we are

6 saying there are certain other situations where the state
7 may have that interest,

but that is not as significant an

8 intrusion as we have with antipsychotic drugs.

And also if he is competent, that case

MR. COLE:

That is correct.

And secondly, in terms

15

of the police power, what the Supreme Judicial Court said

is, when drugs are used to protect safety, they are being

MR. COLE:

We believe that Massachusetts has a

thing we are not going to discuss is what is the effect and

what does it mean that you have already had a commitment

hearing, and what does that allow the state to do?

my first fundamental issue that they say in a footnote, we

are not discussing.

They specifically said one

That was

The second fundamental issue is, they say the one

10

thing we are not going to discuss is, what is the effect on

11

the institution if you allow people to refuse treatment?

Certification makes absolutely no sense for
answering these kinds of questions.
QUESTION*

There is no way —

Well, is it possible -- I am sorry.

Is

15

it possible that although they haven’t squarely decided it,

16

that Massachusetts law might require the very procedures

17

that the court of appeals has ordered?

18

Massachusetts law does not require these procedures?

19

MR. SCHULTZ*

Massachusetts law is constitutional

20

law, is all I can tell you.

Do we know that

The Roe decision --

Did Roe rest on the United States

Constitution at all?

Excuse me?

Excuse me?

In our opinion, yes.

They say --

On what provision of the federal

Constitution?
WR. SCHULTZ;

On the -- I believe they hit the

10

right to privacy, and I don't know if they tied it to the

11

Ninth or the Fourteenth Amendment.

12

are three factors that they are deciding that case on.

13

said, on the Constitution, on the power over guardians.

Now, certainly that is not relevant in this case, because we

15

are discussing whether or not a guardian has to be appointed

in the first place.

and quoted one New York case for the common law talking

18

about what are basic liberty interests, which is the exact

19

same question you would ask as to what constitutionally

20

under the Fourteenth Amendment is a basic liberty interest.

21

In Roe, they said there
They

And then they said, on the common law,

Roe is a constitutional case.

Roe doesn't decide

22

on any statutes or on any Massachusetts regulations.

a constitutional case which is reviewable by this Court,

24

which didn't have the record that this Court has to decide

25

what is the effect on an institution of allowing patients to

It is

If one were to certify, one would have to send down

3 the entire 74-day record, and have the SJC look at that
4 record to decide what the effect on institutions would be.
5

QUESTION;

Didn't Roe expressly disavow any intent

6 to decide an involuntarily committed patient’s right to
7 refuse medication?
8

MR. SCHULTZ;

Absolutely.

They say it four times,

9 and why — the other side is saying it is definitive, but if
10 a court ever went -- they are right, we intervened in Roe,
11 and what did the Commonwealth do when they intervened in
12 Roe?

We said, don't interfere with this case.

This case —

13 Roe does not involve institutionalized patients, and I wrote
14 half of my brief saying don't interfere with this case.
15 they bought it.

And

Four times in their opinions, they say, we

16 are not interfering with the Rogers case.

And I just don’t

17 know how it could be any clearer under the circumstances.
18

I briefly want to mention just, I think, a very

19 basic issue that Justice O’Connor raised, and that is, how

20 many states determine incompetency at the time of
21 commitment?

According to the psychiatric brief, they state

22 one, and I will take it as true.

Utah.

And what the

23 Commonwealth asks is, if you have to determine competency to
24 treat a person against his will, why can you commit that
25 person against his will for treatment without that same

1 determination of incompetency?

And what is really being

2 challenged in this case is the commitments in those 49
3 states, because those people were not committed for
4 dangerousness.
5 dangerous.

You can't commit anybody because he is

That is preventive detention.

They were committed because they were dangerous by

7 reason of mental illness, which the mental illness means
8 they are either subject to care or treatment.

We don't

9 necessarily say everybody is treatable, but we are saying
10 that to the extent that they are treatable, that that is why
11 they were committed.
12 illness.

Dangerous by reason of mental

Not dangerousness.

It doesn't make sense to talk

13 about police power commitments, to say that the state's
14 interest is satisfied when they are taken off the street.
15 The state's interest is not taking people off the street.
16 The state cannot go around saying, you are dangerous, you
17 are dangerous, you are dangerous, you should go off the
18 street.
19

They have to show beyond a reasonable doubt in

20 Massachusetts that they are dangerous by reason of mental
21 illness, or that they are incapable of taking care of
22 themselves by reason of mental illness.

The state can't

23 send somebody to a mental hospital simply because they are
24 incapable of taking care of themselves.

I think the parens

25 patriae power might let them send them some place else, but

why are they sent to a mental hospital?

Because they are

2

mentally ill, and we suggest that this is a fundamental

3 question which has been overlooked by both lower courts.
