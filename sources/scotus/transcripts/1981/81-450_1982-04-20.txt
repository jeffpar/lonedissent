ORAL ARGUHENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. LACOVARA:

9
10

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to

11
12

the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth

13

Circuit.

14

There are three questions presented:
First, whether the United States violates a

15

criminal defendant's Fifth Amendment due process or

16

Sixth Amendment compulsory process rights when it

17

deports an illegal alien after making a reasonable

18

investigation and concluding that the illegal alien has

19

no material exculpatory evidence to make available to

20

the Defendant;

21

Second, assuming that the Government acts at

22

its peril in deporting illegal aliens, whether the

23

Defendant in order to state a constitutional violation

24

still must demonstrate that the loss of the illegal

25

alien has caused him a concrete loss of material

3

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

exculpatory evidence;

2

Finally, assuming that the Court of Appeals is

3 correct that the Respondent’s constitutional rights are
4 violated when the Defendant is deprived of no more than
5 the loss of a conceivable benefit, whether the proper
6

remedy for that technical donstitutional violation is

7 dismissal of the indictment against the Respondent.

9

On March 29th, 1980, Respondent was captured
in the process of transporting five illegal aliens from

10

Escondido, California, to Los Angeles.

11

circumstances surrounding Respondent's arrest were

12

explained by Respondent in his own post-arrest statement

14

Respondent is an illegal alien from Mexico.

15 He entered this country approximately six days prior to
16 his arrest with the assistance of an illegal alien
17 smuggler.

He had been kept in a house in Escondido up

18 to the day of his arrest.
19

On the day he was arrested he agreed with the

20

illegal alien smuggler to transport five additional

21

illegal aliens to Los Angeles in return for the price of

22

his illegal entry into this country.

Respondent had

23 been told that the Border Patrol agents at the Temecula
24 checkpoint were not actually checking for illegal
25 aliens.

Unfortunately for Respondent, he was

The Border Patrol agents then returned

Respondent back to the Border Patrol checkpoint and

informed Respondent of his right to remain silent.

14

however, waived the right and agreed to make a statement

15

under oath, and the recorded statement explained his

the basis, "I already knew that I had had it, too late,

Later he told the agents, "I acknowledge

QUESTION;

Were statements taken from them

before they were released?

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

MR. PHILLIPS:

recorder malfunctioned.

19

the tape recording of Respondent's statement had

20

malfunctioned and there was no statement from him.

21

it turned out that the malfunction occurred during the

22

time that the statements —

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Yes, sir, there were.

What happened to them?
Well, unfortunately the tape
Originally it was thought that

But

So in fact there is no written or

recorded statement from those released?
MR. PHILLIPS:

No, not a specific written or

recorded statement, although I think typically there

2

would be.

3

from the remaining illegal alien, Somero Morales, and

4

the statements from the * agents that all the statements

5

by all the illegal aliens are essentially the same.
QUESTIONS

6

7

from Morales?

And when did they get the statement

Same time?

MB. PHILLIPS:

8

9

Moreover, we do of course have the statement

Subsequently, when he testified

at the hearing, they obtained that statement.

And

10

there's nothing to indicate that his statement at the

11

hearing on the motion to dismiss was different from his

12

statement given to the * agents at the time of his

13

arrest.

14

The Assistant United States Attorney

15

authorized the release of two of the three illegal

16

aliens, chosen at random, and they were released on

17

March 30th.

18

QUESTIONS

Mr. Phillips, I assume the

19

Government could have prosecuted the witnesses who were

20

deported —

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24
25

Yes, ma'am.

— for a criminal offense?
Yes, ma'am.

We could have

prosecuted them for illegal entry into this country.
QUESTION:

But it is the general practice not

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to do that and to simply deport them?

2

3

MR. PHILLIPS*

It is significantly easier on

our resources to do that, yes, ma'am,

4

QUESTION*

There's no claim, I take it, here

5

that the Respondent himself transported the illegal

6

aliens across the border?

7

MR. PHILLIPS*

8

QUESTION*

9
10

Just that he transported them after

they were in the country and they hadn't been here three
yea rs.
MR. PHILLIPS*

11
12

No.

That's correct, that's correct.

Your Honor.

13

The two illegal aliens were returned on March

14

30, concededly prior to the time the Respondent's

15

counsel had any opportunity to interview them.

16

Respondent was indicated on one count, transporting -QUESTION*

17

Was Respondent represented and did

18

the prosecutor know that at the time they were

19

released?
MR. PHILLIPS*

20
21

represented by counsel, no. Your Honor.
QUESTION*

22

23

Ultimately, was he represented by

retained or appointed counsel?
MR. PHILLIPS*

24
25

No, Respondent was not

I believe it was appointed

transporting an illegal alien, Romero Morales, within

this country in violation of 8 U.S.C. Section

4

1324(a)(2).

5

dismiss the indictment on the ground that the

deportation of the two illegal aliens had deprived —

had violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.

8

The district court held a hearing on the

Soon thereafter he filed a motion to

motion —
QUESTION:

Did he make any proffer of what

11

testimony would be given had these people been kept in

12

the country?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Not specifically.

The closest

14

thing to a proffer I suppose would be, he did offer the

15

testimony of Romero Morales at the hearing.

16

Morales was at least putatively a defense witness at the

17

hearing on the motion to dismiss, although I submit that

18

his statements were rather strongly inculpatory of

19

Respondent rather than exculpatory.

20

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, before you go on,

could I get the time sequence in my mind?

MR. PHILLIPS:

QUESTION:

The man was arrested on the 29th of

March, was it?
MR. PHILLIPS;

QUESTION;

And the other occupants of the

vehicle were sent back on the 30th.

HR. PHILLIPS;

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

And he was arraigned on the 31st,

5 was it, the next day?
6

HR. PHILLIPS;

7

QUESTION;

8

Yes, I think so.

Now, when — was counsel appointed

for him on the 31st?
HR. PHILLIPS;

9

QUESTION;

10

I assume that --

So it would have been a question of

11

whether to hold them for one day to give the counsel an

12

opportunity to interview them, is that what we're

13

fighting about?
HR. PHILLIPS;

14

In this specific case it would

15

have been.

16

knowing that at the time necessarily.

17

But there was no way, I don't think, of

QUESTION;

Isn't there a procedure whereby

18

these things are processed in this manner normally?

19

Wouldn't you normally expect the complaint to be filed

20

rather promptly?

21

HR. PHILLIPS;

Well, we would assume that,

22

although of course it's not really accurate, altogether

23

accurate, to say that it's only holding them for a

24

single day.

25

have had counsel appointed at that point, there still

I mean, other than the fact that he would

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

presumably would have been a period of time that counsel

2

would have required in order to investigate the matter

3

and to pursue it.

4
5

Typically the practice is to keep the illegal
aliens for ten days, even after counsel is appointed.
QUESTION:

7

The practice is to keep them for

ten days?

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

QUESTION:

I see.

11

of the ten-day practice?

Is that the — I don't

I'm a little puzzled.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Your Honor.

What is the source

It's just -- it's a common law

practice.

although it is also adopted in other districts.
QUESTION:

16
17
18

I think it's developed primarily by the

Then why wasn't it followed in this

case?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, because the case wasn't

19

submitted — the illegal aliens were already gone prior

20

to the time that it went to the magistrate.

21

QUESTION:

Well, in order to avoid the ten-day

22

rule you must ship them back before the magistrate's

23

complaint is filed, is that right?

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, in a sense, yes, Your

Honor, because the problem is that, given the state of

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the law in the Ninth Circuit/ the magistrate is simply

2

not in a position to release the illegal aliens.

3

we can modify the Ninth Circuit's very strict ruling,

4

it's very difficult to have a magistrate agree to

5

release the illegal aliens, even though there is no

6

likelihood --

7

QUESTION;

Unless

Would the Government's problem be

8

solved if the Ninth Circuit rule were modified to

require them to be kept, say for 24 hours?

It seems to

10

me that the dispute may be narrower than it appears to

11

be.

12

opportunity to interview, and I can see your objection

13

to the ten-day rule, but I wonder if it necessarily

14

would apply to say a 24-hour rule.

The other side seems to be just asking for an

15

HR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I suspect that — I mean,

16 obviously the Government's position would be materially
17

advanced by a 24-hour rule.

But I'm not sure that the

18 decision as to how much time is one that is of -- it’s
19 not an easy judgment to make, and certainly I wouldn’t
20

-- it's a close legislative judgment.
QUESTION:

21

Well, apart from that, Mr.

22

Phillips, I gather — or perhaps I better put it as a

23

question.

24

had counsel in fact been appointed before they were

25

released ?

Do you think they could have been released

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. PHILLIPS*

Well, it might have been — it

2

would have been significantly more difficult.

3

it would have certainly — without consulting counsel,

4

you mean?

5

6
7

QUESTION*

Yes.

I mean,

Would the Government's case

be in any trouble if you did that?
MR. PHILLIPS*

No, I don't think so, because

8

it's still — our submission is that there was no

9

prejudice whatsoever.

And even if there were some claim

10

that we violated his right to counsel, you would still

11

have to have a demonstration of prejudice.

12

QUESTION*

You mean there's no Hassiah

13

overtones after counsel is appointed as to whether or

14

not you may release?

15
16
17

MR. PHILLIPS*

Well, you don't have — I mean,

no, I don't think, no, sir.

No, Your Honor.

At the hearing on the motion to dismiss,

18

testimony was offered by the two arresting * agents, the

19

detained illegal alien, Romero Morales, and the

20

Assistant United States Attorney who approved the

21

release of the two illegal aliens.

Based largey on the

22 post-arrest admissions by the Respondent, the district
23

court held that the loss of the missing illegal aliens

24

could not possibly, or at least with no substantial

25

possibility, have prejudiced Defendant's, Respondent's,

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

case, and therefore he denied the motion to dismiss.

When did the Respondent know that

the witnesses were being sent away?

I suspect probably on the —

Well, I don't know exactly when

he was informed.

QUESTION:

12

know, wouldn't you?

But if he'd had a lawyer you would

MR. PHILLIPS:

13
14

Uh-hmm.

Well, I assume his attorney was

probably informed on the 31st.
QUESTION:

15

The attorney on the 31st.

So

16

neither the Respondent or his lawyer to be appointed had

17

any opportunity to oppose the removal of the witnesses?
MR. PHILLIPSs

18
19

20
21

22

That's absolutely correct, Your

Honor.

QUESTION:

What has happened to this third

witness in the meantime?
MR. PHILLTPS:

He is being detained.

He was

23

detained in custody as a material witness for the

24

Government, and also for the Defendant as it turns out

25

-- I mean, excuse me, for the Respondent.

As it turns

And his statement was that he

for less than two days at the time that Respondent

11

transported him, that Respondent was the driver of the

of the Respondent, in reality I submit that his

testimony was rather inculpatory.

So that while he was nominally a witness on behalf

otherwise, that the two who had gone back to Mexico,

been deported, would have testified to any factors which

20

were not available from the witness who was detained?

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Your Honor, none

22 whatsoever.
23

QUESTION:

Well, how would anybody have made

24

25

opportunity to chat with those witnesses?

And he was there

Well, maybe he was, but his lawyer

never had a chance to talk with them, did he?
MR. PHILLIPS*

9

No, but his lawyer certainly

10

had access to the Respondent and to any information that

11

the Respondent has.

12

QUESTION*

Well, that may be so, but the

13

Respondent probably didn't know what he was — that. A,

14

he was going to be charged, or B, what he was going to

15

be charged with, or what the elements of the crime

16

were .

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, even if Respondent

18

couldn’t make an immediate judgment as to how to proceed

19

in this matter, certainly some time between the period,

20

the time when he was arrested, and the post-arrest

21

period, all the way up until the time of the trial,

22

Respondent had ample opportunity to explain to his

23

attorney what possible defenses might be available.

24

even to this day we still have nothing.

25

QUESTION:

And

That's hardly equivalent to —

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

that's hardly equivalent to knowing what the witnesses

2

would have said in response to questions from the

3

lawyer.

4

MR. PHILLIPS*

Hell, concededly it is somewhat

5

different, although it is not significant — I mean,

6

this case has never had any trouble in the Boviaro

7

context —

9

QUESTIONi

Don't you -- your first submission,

as I understand it, is that the Government should be

10

relied on to decide whether a witness has anything

11

relevant that might help the Defendant.

12

strange submission, isn't it?

were to take — if we were to reason by analogy from

17

United States versus Lovasco, it would seem to us that

18

the rule ought to be that the United States simply, in

19

pursuing its policy with regard to immigration, should

20

simply deport the illegal aliens.

decision.

4

no, that if there was reason to suspect —

Concededly, we have the power

QUESTION;

15

Why?

MR. PHILLIPS;

13

Well, our assumption would be

Deport them without talking to

them.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, that's exactly what the

17

court sanctioned in United States versus Rhodes.

18

we’re not asking this Court to adopt that view, although

19

as I said it would certainly further our immigration

20

policies if the Court were to adept that view.

21

we're prepared to give the Respondent perhaps more

22

protection than he otherwise might require.

25

QUESTION:

But

Well, you want to talk to them

because you want to get a witness for yourself.
MR. PHILLIPS;

You interview the people because

you need witnesses yourself.

3

MR. PHILLIPS;

Admittedly# we do.

But we

also, in the process of interviewing a witness in order

5

to determine whether there's any inculpatory evidence,

6

we necessarily discover whether there is any exculpatory

evidence.
QUESTION;

8

Counsel, what is the Government's

9

main concern, saving the cost involved in maintaining

10

these witnesses in jail over a long period of time or

11

what ?

12

MR. PHILLIPS;

Well, certainly the cost is a

13

significant factor.

14

illegal aliens languishing in jail for a period of time

15

when no one has any intention of calling them as

16

witnesses, either the Government or the Defendant, and

But I think the idea of having

17 no one has -- you know, and they're not going to serve
18

any useful function to anybody, I think that's the

19

primary interest of the Federal Government in these

20

cases.

21

22

And to go back to the statistics that we cited
in our brief, there is something wrong with a rule of

23 law that requires the Federal Government to detain 5,000
24

illegal aliens as material witnesses in a district in

25

which there are 36 trials on Title VIII offenses.

There's something just fundamentally wrong with that.

QUESTION;

Well, how about an early interview

11

at which defense counsel has an opportunity to be

12

present, before release?

13

MR. PHILLIPS;

Well, the difficulty with that,

14

with the idea of an early interview, is, one, it's

15

difficult just to get counsel appointed.

16

of these, a lot of captures, are not in locations where

an early interview will accomplish.

Testimony by the

21

Assistant United States Attorney at the hearing on the

22

motion to dismiss was to the effect that oftentimes

23

defense counsel prefers to be able to try to retain

24

illegal alien material witnesses, even without any

25

expectation of having them testify, simply as leverage

arrangement.

So that I'm not sure that we’re going to gain
anything by virtue of having counsel there earlier.

5
6

QUESTION:

Bhat does he mean, as leverage for

a plea bargain?

7

HR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it is absolutely true

8

that the Government can only hold so many material

9

witnesses.

As it stands now, we are renting out space

10

in the state jails.

11

we can hold no more illegal aliens, we simply either

12

have to release the defendants or release the illegal

13

aliens and thereby end up losing our ability to

14

prosecute.

that was raised by the Chief Justice, what is this

MR. PHILLIPS:

That was a stipulation offered

by the Assistant United States Attorney, Your Honor,

24 that we were willing to stipulate that the illegal

MR. PHILLIPS:

That was agreed to, yes.

That's why there wasn't a trial in this case.
QUESTION:

But that --

Hell, does this excuse the proffer

or not?
MR. PHILLIPS:

20

No, Your Honor.

All that does

21

is explain why there wasn't a specific trial in the

him under your view of the law?
MR. PHILLIPS;

7

10

You mean aside from Fifth and

Sixth Amendment problems?
QUESTION;

8
9

Could the Government have deported

No.

Under your view of this case,

would it have been permissible for the Government to
deport him as well as all the other passengers?
MR. PHILLIPS;

11

Well, it would have been — the

12

problem that that would have created is that we would

13

have lacked a non-hearsay basis for proving some of the

14

elements, perhaps creating a confrontation clause

15

pro blem.

16

QUESTION;

Assume you had a statement that was

17

sufficient from the driver himself, plus the testimony

18

of the two agents who arrested him, that might have made

19

out a sufficient case.

20

suppose under your view you could also have deported the

21

man who was actually the charge was based on, under your

22

view of the law?

23
24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think that's possible.

Then I

Yes, Your Honor, I suspect that

we might well have been able to do that, although -QUESTION;

And the question we have to decide,

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

would that have been consistent with the Constitution.

2

That’s really the issue.

3

MR. PHILLIPS*

Sure.

But still, you have to

4

analyze it on two different grounds:

5

of the reasonableness of our decision to release him,

6

which is probably questionable in those circumstances,

7

since one, detention of one illegal alien, versus three

8

is perhaps not all that onerous a burden on us.

9

One, on the basis

Second of all, you still would have to show

10

that he was a material witness in any sense.

11

typically -- in some ways it's unfortunate in this case

12

that the tape recorder broke, because typically we would

13

have an oral statement from everyone that we could then

14

examine, and that would presumably serve as at least

15

some basis for counsel to inquire as to what possible

16

grounds .

17

QUESTION:

18

you lost this case.

Well, it wouldn’t hurt you much if

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

QUESTION:

21

I mean,

I’m sorry, Your Honor?

It wouldn’t hurt you much, then, if

you lost this case, in the sense that the next case,

22 with a tape recorded statement, would be different.
23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if you were prepared —

24

if the Court were to hold that it is abundantly clear

25

that if we have that statement in hand we can go ahead

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and deport the illegal aliens, that may well be true.

2

But what we’re looking for — I mean, this specific case

3 is not what’s terribly important.

This is not a case

4 about two illegal aliens and one criminal defendant.
5
6

This is a case literally about thousands of
illegal aliens.

The United States captures — has

7 captured in each of the last three years one million
8

illegal aliens.

Each of those -- not every one of those

9 illegal aliens, of course, necessarily raises a
10

Mendez-Rodriguez problem.

But if you consider that most

11

of them probably had some assistance coming into this

12

country, probably had some assistance in trying to

13 conceal themselves from the authorities, and probably
14 because of where they ended up having to stay in this
15 country came across criminal activity of another nature,
16 the chances of a Kendez-Rodriguez problem with regard to
17 all one million of those illegal aliens is fairly good.
18

And it cannot be that the Government is

19 responsible to keep all those illegal aliens.
QUESTION;

20

Hr. Phillips, suppose it were

21

perfectly clear that counsel would always be appointed,

22

in the vast majority of instances, within 24 hours after

23 arrest or 48 hours after arrest, and the rule was that
24 you should give counsel one day and then you can deport
25 witnesses.

Now you would have to hold all these people

2

Hell, that's not altogether

3

clear, Your Honor.

4

mean after they interview them and regardless of what

5

they say we then have the right to go ahead and deport

6

them?

I mean, the question is, does that

Or what if they interpose an objection, is the

7

8

problem.

Then they interpose an objection, we go to a

9

magistrate under the Ninth Circuit's regimen.
QUESTION*

10

Well, you would be in the position,

11

and you would be, if somehow this alien, this defendant,

12

had a lawyer with him in the room when he was arrested,

13

and he went around and he subpoenaed all these

14

witnesses.

15

them?

16

What would you do with them then, deport

MR. PHILLIPS*

Well, if he asked — well, no.

17

Obviously if he had a subpoena in hand we wouldn’t.

18

might try to quash the subpoena.

QUESTION:

We

Well, that’s just one of those

problems about what the Government does -QUESTION:

Well, does the subpoena prevent you

22 from deporting them?
23

MR. PHILLIPS*

Well, I think — I guess the

24

subpoena doesn't actually act against the Government.

25

It acts against the illegal alien.

QUESTION:

You might -- consequences might

attach to your deportation of him, but I wouldn’t think

3 that —
4

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, that's true.

It wouldn't

5 directly prohibit us from deporting him.
6

QUESTION:

But you wouldn’t deport them, I

7 don't suppose, would you?
8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

QUESTION:

I suspect we would not, no.

I don't understand why under a

10

24-hour rule you would be precluded from deporting them

11

after they'd been interviewed, because the burden would

12

remain on the defendant to make a showing that their

13 testimony would have been material, I would suppose.
14

MR. PHILLIPS:

I’m sorry, Your Honor.

I

15 missed that.
16

QUESTION:

You seem to assume that if there

17 were a 24-hour rule where you just somehow or other get
18 your counsel appointed immediately, then they interview
19 you, you seem to be assuming you could not then
20

immediately deport if you're satisfied they have nothing

21

material to present, because then I would suppose if you

22

did deport the lawyer, having interviewed the person,

23 would be in a position to make a showing, if he could,
24 that there was some material testimony.
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

I guess our response to that is

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that I don't see that there's any significant difference

2

between what we've done here, because I don't think that

3

the appointment of counsel in this situation would have

4

materially altered the ultimate findings of the district

5

court, that should have been upheld by the Court of

6

Appeals.

7

QUESTION:

Well, that's if you assume that the

8

prosecutor should be the one who does the investigating

9

for defense counsel on the facts.

10
11
12

13

That's the basic

assumption.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it's only that the

Government makes the initial determination.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but it's a

14

determination that totally forecloses the opportunity

15

for the defense counsel to investigate.

16

MR. PHILLIPS;

But I mean — I guess our

17

response to that is that it's just not simply realistic

18

to .say that they cannot know.

19

this case is distinguishable from Roviaro, where you're

20

denied access to the confidential informant unless you

21

can make a showing that he has some materiality.

22

don't'— you've never talked to him.

23

I mean, I don't see how

You

The assumption is because you were present at

24

the crime that you can take action, and therefore — and

25

this Court has consistently upheld the right of the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

as in that case.

17

No, of course they could have

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
I'd like to address four of the issues in this

case.

The first is the issue of what the statute with

20

which Mr. Valenzuela was charged required for proof of

21

conviction and what the defense in the case was;

22

secondly, the way in which the Government's action in

23

this case violated the Sixth Amendment right to

24

compulsory process; third, what the actual procedure is

25

in the Southern District of California in implementing

decision that has been adopted by the circuits, three

3

other circuits, the Fifth, the Seventh, and recently in

Armijo-Martinez the Sixth.

5

6
7

QUESTION;

Well, the Fifth is a little

different, isn't it?
Mr. Justice Blackmun, as we talk about that in

8

the brief, the original decision was Avila-Dominguez,

9

and in that case the Court of Appeals for the Fifth

10

Circuit held that deportation of the witnesses before an

11

interview is a violation of due process, the sanction

12

for which is dismissal.

13

the automatic dismissal rule.

14

However, they said, we reject

The Ninth Circuit, of course, does not have an

15

automatic dismissal rule, and in a subsequent case,

16

Henao, the Fifth Circuit said that the standard is that

17

the defense in order to obtain relief must show either a

18

plausible theory or some slight suggestion concerning

19

which the witnesses could have helped.

20

QUESTION;

That strikes me as out of line with

21

the Ninth Circuit's approach.

22

MR. IREDALE;

23

QUESTION;

24
25

Well, whether you call it --

I'm just objecting to your saying

that the Fifth Circuit has followed the Ninth.
MR. IREDALE;

I should say that with the

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

exception -- to our mind, the difference between the

2

terms "plausible theory" or "some slight suggestion" and

3

the Ninth Circuit formulation of "conceivable benefit"

4

is a matter of semantics.

5

that there is some difference in the formulation of the

6

test, although the Fifth has held that deportation in

7

this context violates compulsory process.

But I think you’re correct

Finally, I’d like to discuss the Government's
proposal and why it would strike at the heart of the

justice system.

14

The Respondent was charged in this case with a
violation -QUESTION:

Mr. Iredale, before you go on to

15

that section, am I correct in thinking that the Ninth

16

Circuit did not require the Defendant to make any sort

17

of a showing here before it dismissed the indictment?

18

MR. IREDALE*

No, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Nr. Iredale, as I understand your

2

statements as to what the Defendant showed here, it was

3

simply letters to the missing witnesses saying that it

4

would be very desirable to interview them on certain

5

points.

6

Was there nothing more than that?
MR. IREDALE:

Your Honor, there was also a

7

statement in argument by counsel that we wanted the

8

witnesses because we felt that they could possibly

9

testify in such a way as he might be found not guilty of

10

the crime of knowingly transporting aliens, and then

11

this followed a colloquey when the Assistant U.S.

12

Attorney was on the stand in which the questions were

13

asked which set forth the defense in this case, the

14

defense which the Ninth Circuit recognized in its

15

opinion.

16

One of the elements of illegal transportation

17

of aliens is that a person has to have reasonable

18

grounds knowing that the people came into the United

19

States within the last three years.

23

In other words, we showed both in the district

25

could have proffered evidence that would have been

QUESTION:

What was that defense?

Relevant one way or the other, it

3

would have helped the Government or it would have helped

you.
MR. IREDALE:

6

Yes.

And because we didn't have

the witnesses we'll never be able to know for sure.
QUESTION:

7

Well, couldn't the Defendant

8

himself have made some sort of an affidavit or proffer

9

if in fact he hadn't talked to any of the deported

10

witnesses in the car?
MR. IREDALE:

11

Well, there are several reasons

12

why that would not be, I would suggest, an appropriate

13

procdedure.

15

the relevant evidence that can be given by the

16

witnesses.

First of all is the fact that, as a general

He's talked to his lawyer and

not to testify.
QUESTION:

23

Well, sure, and he has other kinds

of rights that if he doesn't testify he may not help

MR. IREDALE*

I understand that, Your Honor

2

But the point is I think that, in the absence of some

3

immunity in the Simmons context, the Defendant could get

4

up on the stand or submit an affidavit which could later

5

be used, parts of which could later be used at the trial

6

in the case in chief to convict him, and that would be

an inappropriate showing.

Well, presumably if he swears to

something and says, I didn’t talk to these witnesses

fear he need have is that the witnesses will actually

12

come back and say, yes, he did talk to me a lot in the

car.

I don't see that that's unduly penalizing if he

Well, we’re reviewing the Ninth

Circuit here.
MR. IREDALE*

Yes, I understand.

I think the

22 appropriate test would be not to require the Defendant
23

to come forth and make any showing, but to allow his

24

counsel by statement or by some indication as to the

25

possible defense to show how these witnesses could have

Mr. Iredale, could the Defendant

witnesses could conceivably, because we'll never know

11

for sure what they would have, they could have given

12

evidence that would have helped his case.

13
14

Now, let me just address this, because the
Government seems to say this Defendant was so guilty it

15 doesn't matter.

Well, certainly there was no question

16 that he transported the persons, that one of them in
17 fact was an alien, and given all of the evidence in the
18 light most favorable to the Government possibly even
19

that he knew of his illegal status.

20

But 8 U.S.C. 1324(a)(2), the statute employed

21

in this case, requires that the Defendant know that the

22

alien had entered illegally within the last three years

23 before the transportation.
24

QUESTION;

What was the testimony of the one

25 witness who did remain?

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. IREDALE:

The testimony in that regard,

2

Your Honor, was that he did not enter with Mr.

3

Valenzuela, that he met Mr. Valenzuela at a house in

4

Escondido, which is some 50 miles north of the border.

5
6

QUESTION:

Did he testify how long he had been

in the country?

7

MR. IREDALE:

Yes.

The witness — Mr.

8

Valenzuela, the indication was from his statement, had

9

been in the country six years.

The witness had been in

10

the country between a day and a half and possibly as

11

little as 12 hours when he arrived at the house in

12

Escondido.

13
14
15

QUESTION:

What did he testify to as to

communicating that information to this Respondent?
MR. IREDALE:

He denied any communication

16

whatsoever, one way or the other.

And the point of

17

course is that, although he was the one witness that the

18

Government chose to charge, the other witnesses were

19

apparently in his company and it is conceivable that

20

these witnesses would have said something to Mr.

21

Valenzuela, such as for instance one saying to the other

22

in his presence, you remember when we were up in the

23

Imperial Valley three years ago picking those grapes,

24

which would indicate to Valenzuela that, albeit without

25 legal status, they had not in fact illegally entered the

42

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. IREDALE;

That's correct.

But the issue

6

is, the factual setting is such that, anything any one

7

of the witnesses could have said to the other,

8

Valenzuela could have perceived that they were there

9

together, that they were friends, that they were in the

10

same status, and what was true as to one was true as to

11

the other.
QUESTION;

12
13

And the witness who was there said

he didn’t say anything to the Defendant, is that right?

14

MR. IREDALE;

15

QUESTION;

MR. IREDALE;

As to how long he had been there?

deficient.

the whole circumstances certainly are not consistent

MR. IREDALE;

where they work up to the north, and they have to get

7

through the checkpoint, and then they come back south

8

and work in the south, and then they go back up north,

without necessarily entering back into Mexico.

And he

could have inferred that or believed that that was the

situation here.

In other words, a verbatim record is kept of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

given the interview, then the defense would have to make

2

a specific particularized definite concrete exculpatory

showing.

QUESTION:

So if the Government — if the

Government made the witnesses available to a defense

them, the Government, if it was confident enough, could

8

just deport them if they were sure you couldn't make the

9

showing?

10

MR. IREDALE:

Let me just say, I hesitate at

11

the formulation of a day, because depending on the facts

12

of the case a reasonable time might be necessary.

13

might need to see -- for instance, in order to interview

assumes it sustains a reasonable burden of proof that

MR. IREDALEs

In Washington versus Texas this

19 are relevant to the defense.

On that point, Mr. Phillips, at

Mendez-Hodriguez motions filed in a total of 239 cases,

19

and only one motion was granted.

20

ME. PHILLIPS;

Is that accurate?

We did not independently

21

evaluate that, although we wouldn't be terribly

22

surprised if there aren't a lot of Mendez-Hodriguez

23

cases in light of the fact that the Government's

24

practice is typically to detain all illegal aliens

25

and/or to dismiss the charges.

I don't know where -- I don't

understand how Respondent can make that claim.

2

to me inconceivable in light of cases like Tsutagava,

3

where the Government has to detain 39 material witnesses

could be that if the Government altered its position the

7

Well, you're certainly acting at

8

your peril now.

You don't say that you can just —

9

well, I guess you do.

Your submission really is that if

10

you -- once you've interview them and the Government

11

makes a decision that they would have no exculpatory

12

evidence, that you can deport them, and as long as you

13

act in good faith that's the end of the matter, no

matter what the showing is on the other side.

MR. PHILLIPS*

16

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. PHILLIPS:

The Ninth Circuit holds that if

we make a determination that there is no connection in

2

defendant, then we can —

3

QUESTION:

Well, you say on the facts of this

4

case if you make a good faith judgment that, even though

5

they were present on the spot, that they would have no

6

exculpatory evidence, that's the end of the matter no

MR. PHILLIPS:

Sure, but all we’re suggesting,

though, is that there's not a demonstrable difference

10
11

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that your submission?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, that is our submission.

13

But that's not demonstrably different from the judgment

14

we'd make otherwise.

that.

Well then, suppose we rejected

What's your next fallback?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Is that Respondent under any

circumstances must demonstrate with some concreteness

19

the materiality of the witnesses who were lost, which

20

they cannot do in this case.

21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

And is that rule extant in any

circuit that you know of
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Your Honor, I believe the

Fifth Circuit adopts a rule —

1

Fifth Circuit?

2

MR. PHILLIPS;

I think so, Your Honor, because

3

in the Avila-Dominguez case those witnesses were

4

witnesses to the crime at the time they were arrested,

5

and the court held that they could be — that they could

6

be sent away.

7

QUESTION;

So you — ,so you would be acting at

8

your peril in deporting witnesses under the Fifth

9

Circuit rule?
MR. PHILLIPS;

there is review.

review of our determination.

No, we regularly take that

risk. Your Honor.
