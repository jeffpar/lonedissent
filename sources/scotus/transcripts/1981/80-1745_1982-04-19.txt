CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in F. W. Woolworth against the State of New Mexico.
Mr. Goldman, I think you may proceed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM L. GOLDMAN, ESQ.,

6

05 BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. GOLDMAN;

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, this state income tax case involves

9

the same basic constitutional issues that you discussed

10

this morning and this afternoon in the ASARCO case.
Woolworth, the Appellant in this case, is a

11
12

New York corporation engaged in the retail business

13

throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and the

14

Virgin Islands.

15

sells at retail through its Woolworth and Woolco

16

stores.

17

subsidiaries that are engaged in the same general type

18

of business in Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and

19

Mexico.

It purchases consumer items that it

Woolworth also owns four major foreign
/

20

The dispositive issue here is whether the

21

retail businesses of the foreign subsidiaries are

22

functionally integrated with Woolworth's domestic retail

23

business in the United States.

24

operations are functionally integrated, then we agree

25

that the dividends paid by the foreign subsidiaries are

If the foreign

1

properly includable in apportionable income.

That was

2

the question decided by this Court in Mobil, and the

3

reason would be that where you have an admittedly

4

unitary business, as this Court recognized in Underwood

5

Typewriter, it is impossible to allocate specifically

6

the portion of the profits of that business that were

7

earned in any particular jurisdiction where the business

8

was conducted.
And so formulary apportionment is appropriate,

9
10

and for that purpose, where the unitary business

11

includes the operations of the subsidiaries, the

12

dividends can be treated as part of the apportionable

13

income.

14

including the operations of the subsidiaries, so the

15

dividends are included in the apportionable base, then

16

that would necessitate the payroll, property, and sales

17

of the subsidiaries be correlatively reflected in the

18

apportionment —

Of course, if the business were defined as

19

QUESTION*

20

just the dividends.

21

Hell, in that case it wouldn't be
It would be the income of the subs.

MR. GOLDMAN*

Your Honor, if the state were

22

seeking to have combined reporting, we might be

23

concerned about the treatment of the underlying

24

operating income.

25

QUESTION*

Hell, is your position then, if

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

they are going to take the dividends into account# they

2

must take into account all of the property and payroll?

3
4

MB. GOLDMAN*

No, Your Honor.

The answer is

essentially the same as was made this morning.

5

QUESTION*

All right.

6

MR. GOLDMAN*

Thank you.

Where the dividends paid reflect

7

a percentage of the profits earned by the subsidiary#

8

then you should reflect a commensurate percentage of the

9

underlying payroll, property, and sales that are fairly

10

related to the portion of the profits being distributed.

11

On the other hand, where the operations of the

12

subsidiary are not functionally related to the business

13

being conducted in the United States, the dividends

14

should not be included in apportionable income.

15

dividends have no role to play in the state tax

16

calculation, because they represent income earned in the

17

course of totally unrelated activities.

18

QUESTION*

The

I get a feeling you are using the

19

term "functionally related" in not quite the same way as

20

your friends on the preceding case.

21

MR. GOLDMAN;

By functionally related, I am

22

referring to the operational activities conducted by the

23

subsidiaries in their respective countries.

24
25

QUESTION*

If —

All of your business is retail

sales, is it not, domestic and foreign?

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. GOLDMAN;

2

QUESTION;

3

That's correct.

And that distinguishes it in some

respects from the prior case, does it not?
MR. GOLDMAN;

4

Well, it distinguishes this case

5

from some of the subsidiaries that pay dividends to

6

ASARCO.

7

is engaged in a comparable line of business as the

8

parent corporation.

9

QUESTION;

10
11

There was discussion this morning of MIM, which

And with asbestos, which they said

was a different —
MR. GOLDMAN;

That's correct.

The state made

12

a distinction between the cases where the subsidiary was

13

engaged in the same or similar line of business and an

14

unrelated line of business.

15

make absolutely no difference at all where the

16

operations of the businesses are functionally separate

17

and unrelated.

18

much of Woolworth's income is fairly attributable to its

19

operations in New Mexico.

20

tax, and if income is earned in the course of separate

21

activities, albeit the same type of business, but

22

functionally separate, so that income is earned by a

23

self-contained, free-standing business operating in

24

Europe, then New Mexico has no claim to tax any part of

25

that income.

Our point is that it should

The question here is to determine how

That is all New Mexico can

It can only claim a share of the income

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

earned from the business a portion of which is conducted

2

in New Mexico.
The key question as to whether the income from

3
4

the foreign subsidiaries should be taken into account,

5

the key issue is whether the businesses are related,

6

functionally related, not whether it is the same kind of

7

business.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION*

Do you think our cases lay down any

test for when a business is or is not functionally
related to another one?
MR. GOLDMAN*

Oh, absolutely.

I think through

12

all of the decisions of this Court, starting with Adams

13

Express, and Underwood, Bass, Ratcliff, I think in every

14

instance where this Court has found a unitary business,

15

there has been a degree of functional relationship

16

between the operations of the business that is totally

17

missing in this case.

*

18

QUESTION*

I think —
Well, it may be possible to go back

19

through the facts of each of the cases and say that all

20

of them conform to one pattern, but do you rely upon any

21

one case for a definition of your term "functionally

22

integrated"?

23

MR. GOLDMANi

Not as such, Your Honor.

I

24

think what the cases say is, where the business earns

25

its profits as a whole as an economic unit, then you

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

have a unitary business.

There is a phrase, "as a

2

unit”, "operating as a unit", in the Adams Express case,

3

for example, and in that opinion the Court goes on to

4

say that unity of ownership is insufficient, because you

5

can have two separate businesses with the same

6

ownership, and as long as they operate separately, then

7

they have no relationship to each other, but I don't —

8

I can't point to a sentence as such which defines a

9

unitary business, but I think it is easy to read all of

10

the opinions and come away with the absolute conviction

11

that in order to have a unitary business, there must be

12

a functional relationship.
What this Court said -- one guide may be in

13
14

the Mobil opinion.

The Court said that in order to show

15

that the dividends are not apportionable, you must show

16

that they were earned in the course of activities

17

unrelated to the business conducted in the taxing

18

state.

19

activities unrelated to the business conducted in the

20

taxing state.

s

21

The income must be earned in the course of

All of the income earned by Woolworth's

22

subsidiaries is earned in the course of activities

23

unrelated to the conduct of the domestic retail business.

24
25

QUESTION

Are we to infer from that that the

source of supply for the European outlets is all in the

European market?

2

MR. GOLDMAN;

The record is very clear.

Let

3

me get to the facts, Your Honor.

4

clear that each corporation conducted its inventory

5

purchasing on a separate basis.

6

subsidiary purchased its inventory in its own country,

7

but the facts show that even where they purchased in the

8

same countries, in the Orient, for example, each one

9

purchased separately from the others and on its own, and

The record is very

To a large extent, each

10

indeed there is a suggestion that they may to a certain

11

extent almost have been competitive with each other, but

12

certainly there was no coordinated central purchasing

13

function at all.
Let’s look at the facts in the case.

14

The

15

record shows that each subsidiary independently carried

16

on all of the essential operations of a retail

17

business.

18

determining the type and quantity of merchandise to

19

carry,.purchasing the inventory, advertising, funding of

20

operations, accounting and cash control, personnel

21

selection and training.

22

were carried on separately by each subsidiary.

23

subsidiary was a self-contained economic unit.

24
25

These include selecting site for stores,

All of the essential functions
Each

I think the facts in this case stand in sharp
contrast, as I said before, to all of the prior

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

decisions of this Court in which a functionally

2

integrated unitary business has been found to be

3

present.

4

guidance here is Butler Brothers v. McColgan, since it

5

also involved a mercantile operation.

6

wholesale business that consisted of distributing houses

7

in seven states and a central office in Chicago.

In that case, a

The Court found that the business was an

8

9

The case that perhaps provides the clearest

integrated, unitary business because of the presence of

10

centralized management, centralized purchasing, and

11

centralized advertising, and for those reasons, the

12

operations of all of the separate distributing houses

13

were found to be integral parts of a single unitary

14

business, so that in determining how much of the income

15

was apportionable, or taxable, I should say, in

16

California, apportionment was upheld.
Now, how does this case compare to Eutler

17
18

Brothers?

19

in this case.

20

exception of one officer of the Canadian subsidiary,

21

that none of the officers of the foreign subs was also

22

an officer of the parent company.

23

There is absolutely no centralized management
The record shows that with the possible

QUESTION:

I take it then if Woolworth just

24

transformed itself into a holding company, and each of

25

its stores in each of the 50 states was owned by a

9

1

subsidiary, similar to those that are operating abroad,

2

those subsidiaries should be treated as non-unitary also.
MR. GOLDMAN:

3

No, Your Honor.

He are very

4

emphatic in saying that the form of corporation

5

organization should make no difference whatsoever.

6

domestic retail business was conducted in an integrated

7

fashion, with centralized -QUESTION:

8
9

The

Hell, I know, but suppose it was —

suppose the operations in each of the states was

10

actually carried on precisely like the operations of the

11

subsidiarias abroad.

12

MR. GOLDMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

If those —

Then you would have exactly the

same result.
MR. GOLDMAN:

15

If those were the facts, then we

16

would say that each state could — would be,

17

constitutionally barred from taxing any of the income

18

earned in any other state.

19

QUESTION:

All right.

20

QUESTION:

Of course, here you did have some

21

interlocking directorates.

QUESTION:

MR. GOLDMAN:

QUESTION:

25

Thank you.

Except in the German.
That's correct. Your Honor.

Hhy was that different from the

others?

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. GOLDMAN*

1

My understanding is that the

2

form of corporate organization there did not include a

3

board of directors.

4

that there were no directors of the German corporation.

That is what the record suggests,

5

QUESTIONS

So if it had, you would have had —

6

MR. GOLDMANs

We would have had the

7

opportunity to elect them as the controlling

8

shareholders.

9

QUESTIONS

And presumably would have put them

10

on as you did with the others.
MR. GOLDMANs

11

Well, the record shows that

12

there was some, although not totally overlapping, but

13

some interlocking directors.

14

what that shows is that we owned the stock of the

15

subsidiaries.

16

about that, and in voting the stock we exercised the

17

normal stewardship functions, the normal functions of an

18

owner.

19

apportionable, then, contrary to this Court's statement

20

in Mobil, dividends from all subsidiaries would

21

inevitably be apportionable wherever the parent

22

conducted its business.

23

I think what that shows,

I mean, that is — there is no question

But if that per se made the dividends

QUESTIONi

Was the management of the

24

individual companies sort of integrated with the

25

management of the entire organization?

At least, did

they sort of rotate around?

2

next year you are going to go run the store in Los

3

Angeles, and maybe next year in Berlin?
MR, GOLDMANi

4

Did you say, well, now,

Exactly the opposite was the

5

case.

Each subsidiary hired and trained its own

6

officers.

7

to develop a line of questioning that showed that

8

perhaps at an operational level the director of

9

purchasing from one company spoke to the director of

10

purchasing from another, and that was refuted by the

11

answers to the questions.

There was an attempt by counsel for the state

though, to capitalize on the value of the name?

statement in the record that shows one way or the other,

1

except to point out that in managing and directing each

2

subsidiary, the management of each subsidiary was —

3

catered to local tastes and local needs, and that in

4

Germany, for example, there was an emphasis on soft

5

goods, dresses, coats, and so on, because apparently

6

that was found to be successful in Germany, and by

7

comparison, in the operation of the U.K. stores, they

8

had a supermarket and food operations, and that was

9

considered to be part of a Woolvorth's operation in the

10

U.K.

The operations were in fact dissimilar, and

11

operated in a fashion that made sense in each country.
QUESTIONS

12

Well, they wouldn't sell fur coats

13

in Phoenix, either, but you might in Few York or Boston,

14

I suppose.
MR. GOLDMAN:

15

That's correct, Your Honor, but

17

the point is that each subsidiary was functionally
»
independent, was a self-contained unit, had its own

18

management, its own purchasing, its own policy decisions

19

as to the type and quantity of inventory to carry

20

without regard or consideration as to what decisions

21

were made along parallel lines in the operation of the

22

same type of business in another location.

QUESTION:

23

In Germany, the name Woolworth

24

would hardly be confused with a German organization,

25

would it?

The local Germans would not think that was

2

I can't say whether a German in

operation in the U.S. or may ever have heard, of it.

may think it is totally indigenous to —

Well, sometimes the use of a name

is just a matter of family ego, is it not?
MR. GOLDMAN*

9

He

Well, the fact is that at least

as far as the U.K. and the U.S. operations are

10

concerned, they started out at the same time, so neither

11

one was benefitting or could conceivably have benefitted

12

from whatever name recognition there was, and there is

13

no suggestion that in a retail type of operation which

14

is essentially local, that there would have been any

15

recognition on the part of a German resident of

16

Woolworth as being a U.S. or having any U.S. connections

17

at all.

only was a German Woolworth.

Mr. Goldman, would you concede that

the domiciliary state could tax this income?
MR. GOLDMAN*

The taxing jurisdiction of a

23

domiciliary state and the taxing jurisdiction of a

24

non-domiciliary state, which is what we are talking

25

about here, stand on different footing, I believe, for

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

due process purposes.

QUESTION:

7

MR. GOLDMAN:

Would you concede that the
That is my question.

Yes, I would.

In its entirety?
For due process purposes, I

8

would agree that the domiciliary state could tax the

9

income because a domiciliary state is entitled to tax

10

income that may have its source outside the domiciliary

11

state, and so whatever its rights and prerogatives may

12

be don’t answer the question, however, as to the rights

13

of New Mexico.

14

QUESTION:

All right.

What about the

15

taxability in the non-domiciliary state of short-term

16

investment income?

17

MR. GOLDMAN:

If the short-term investment

18

income can be said to be part of the operating income of

19

the unitary business, then we agree, as we agreed with

20

the dividends here in issue, if that were an appropriate

21

conclusion, that the short-term investment income could

22

be included in the apportionable income base.

23

QUESTION:

And under what circumstances would

24

long-term investment income be treatable in the same

25

fashion, in your view?

paper, buying Treasury notes wouldn't be taxable, the

7

MR. GOLDMAN*

If the short-term investment

8

income resulted from the investment management of

9

working capital, so that it was part of the cash flow

10

operation of the business, we would agree that managing

11

the cash flow of your business is sufficiently

12

functionally integrated with your business so that the

13

income from that type of short-term investment could be

14

apportionable.

15

would be because of the type of activities that gave

16

rise to it and their relationship to the business.

17

The reason it would be apportionable

In this case, there is no relationship between

18

the businesses of the foreign subsidiaries and the

19

business, the domestic retail business in the United

20

States, except for the fact that you have the same

21

corporate owner, that Woolworth owns the stock, and if

22

owning the stock of a sub that is engaged in the same

23

line of business could give rise to apportionable

24

income, then we think there is no room for an investment

25

in an operating subsidiary.

We think it plain also —

I think the basis for

the decision below was the court's conclusion that

11

Woolworth cooperatively and jointly with the

12

subsidiaries was conducting a single unitary business,

13

and it felt for that reason that it could hold the

14

dividends to be apportionable under Mobil.

15

QUESTION:

Then the two states really take a

16

different position, because as I understood the Idaho

argument, they would have agreed that the fact — the

18

formula would be different in a case such as this.

19

MR. GOLDMAN*

Hell, I think the courts took a

20

different approach.

I think the state in our case, if I

21

may characterize their argument from their brief, agrees

22

now that the businesses were not in fact part of a

23

single unitary business, so the state will have to make

24

its own argument this afternoon, but they were arguing

25

at least through the New Mexico Supreme Court level and

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

even in the briefs they filed in opposition to our

2

jurisdictional statement that all the corporate entities

3

here were cooperatively conducting a single unitary

4

business, and I understand that they no longer take that

5

position.

6

One point I would like to emphasize in

7

connection with the opinion below, there is a statement

8

in the decision of the New Mexico Supreme Court in

9

describing the evidence relied upon by the state to the

10

effect that there was some intercompany flow of goods, a

11

statement which might suggest that there indeed was some

12

functional integration.

13

refutes that, contradicts that, and that was just a

14

misstatement of fact by the New Mexico Supreme Court,

15

and again, we understand at this point, since we made

16

that point rather emphatically in our brief, that the

17

state agrees with us.

18
19

QUESTION*

In fact, the record absolutely

You cited in your brief — does the

other side concede that that is error?

20

MR. GOLDMAN*

I believe so.

I believe so.

21

We think it plain under the decisions of this

22

Court that if the operations of the foreign subsidiaries

23

had been conducted directly in divisions of Mobil --

24

excuse me, of Woolworth, rather than in subsidiaries, we

25

think it plain that the income, the operating income of

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

those divisions could not have been apportioned to New

2

Mexico.

3

the operations into subsidiaries, ought not to change

4

the result.

5

think in Mobil what you held was where you have

6

admittedly unitary operations generating income that

7

would have been apportionable had they been conducted

8

directly by the parent, then the apportionability of

9

that income cannot be avoided by transferring the

12

13

14 subsidiary.
15

We think that what the Court said was that the

16 form of organization does not affect the underlying
17

economic realities and cannot affect the

18

apportionability of the income that the parent receives.

19

If I may, I would like to turn at this point

20

to the Section 78 gross-up issue.

It is a technical

21

issue, and it is covered at length in the briefs.

22

would just like to make a few basic points about it.

23

Number One, I want to emphasize that unlike the state,

24

our position with respect to the Section 78 gross-up

25

amount is not dependent on your decision with respect to

I

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the apportionability of dividends.

2

If you hold that dividends are not

3

apportionable, that automatically resolves the Section

4

78 gross-up question in our favor, but even if you

5

should hold that some of the dividends may be

6

apportioned, we still have all of our arguments with

7

respect to the Section 78 gross-up amount.
The basic point that we make with respect to

8

9

the Section 78 gross-up amount is that the taxpayer's

10

federal tax liability is unrelated to its state tax

11

calculation.

12

dividend of $100, that is the amount that gets included

13

in apportionable income, and it is irrelevant for that

14

purpose whether the associated federal tax liability was

15

$5 or $50.

16

apportionable income, but the Section 78 gross-up amount

17

is related 'only to the computation of the federal tax

18

liability.

19

credit, it should reduce the foreign tax liability from

$50 down to $5, you still can't increase as a

23

1

the Court should hold that any of the income is

2

includable in apportionable income.

3

point to be made here is that New Mexico can only tax

4

income that can be fairly said to be attributable to the

5

activities conducted in New Mexico, and if you include

6

in the apportionable income base any income which is in

fact attributable to activities conducted in Germany or

income to New Mexico, a modest amount considering the

21

activities of the taxpayer in the state.

indication, some evidence that really that does not
