5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME B. FALK, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

7

MR. FALK:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

8 it please the Court, though we were here before in
9 California versus Texas, the issues of jurisdiction now
10 presented by this petition were not addressed in any of the
11 briefs of the parties, or with the exception of the Eleventh
12 Amendment issue in the concurring opinion.
13

Indeed, it is fair to say that in the days

14 following the decision in California versus Texas, many of
15 us, myself included, thought that the concurring opinions
16 had pointed the way to a workable and fair procedure for the
17 resolution of the domicile dispute concerning the domicile
18 of Howard Hughes.
19

However, in the months that followed, numerous

20 procedural and jurisdictional problems not ventillated in
21 California versus Texas became apparent.

22

I intend to discuss three grounds which preclude,

23 in our view, preclude the district court from exercising
24 jurisdiction in this case.

A central theme of those issues

25 is that Congress has simply never undertaken to fashion a

3

1

statutory process for the resolution of interstate death tax

2

controversies of this kind.

3

bend the federal Interpleader Act to that task, but for the

4

three reasons I will discuss, the Act simply will not serve.

The court of appeals sought to

5

Moreover, though I will not separately discuss the

6

issue today of changing venue, the court of appeals use and

7

understanding of the Interpleader Act would produce what we

8

believe is the absurd and unfair result of requiring a

9 state, California in this instance, to litigate its death
10

tax claim for what is an enormous sum of money before a jury

11

of Texas citizens when the issue involves the rival claim of

12

the state of Texas.

13

Ws submit that this is, if nothing else, further

14

evidence that Congress could not possibly have intended the

15

Interpleader Act to be used in this fashion.

16

The first ground of objecting to jurisdiction is,

17

of course, 28 U.S.C. 1251(a).

18

recent years allowed concurrent lower court jurisdiction for

19

most categories of controversies which are within the

20

court's original jurisdiction, one category has remained

21

outside the concurrent jurisdiction mode, and has always

22

been within the court's original and exclusive jurisdiction,

23

namely, controversy among different states.

24
25

Although Congress has in

action in a district court with the clear command of

and need not be

I say that because this case is different

what was before the Court in 1978.

Then Justice

15 Stewart was able to write that each state was free to
16 proceed

in its own courts, and each state could obtain, in

17 theory,

in its own courts a favorable judgment, without

18 regard to the acts of the other or the proceedings in the

That is no longer true.

2 California must lose.

Each is enjoined by the district court from

4 proceeding in their respective state courts.

The states

6 and this is therefore now a

controversy between states

12 that

that court could conclude that under the law of

13 California as well as under the law of Texas, that Nr.
14 Hughes was a domiciliary of both states?
15

MR. FALK;

Is that impossible?

Yes, Jusice O'Connor, it is impossible

16 under our law and under the law of the state of Texas, and I
17 believe under the law of every state in the United States,
18 but certainly under the laws of the two states.

An

19 individual may have but one domicile.

QUESTION;

Is that constitutionally requisite, do

you think?

FALK;

decisions make clear that states can

24 have other bases for taxation, but in the cases of
25 California and Texas, they do not.

QUESTIONS

1

What I was trying to get at is, do you

2

think it is a constitutional principle that one may have

3

only one domicile?

4

MR. FALKs

5

it i

No, I meant to say that I do not believe

constitutional principle.

6

QUESTIONS

You do not.

7

MR. FALK;

It is simply the law of California and

8

the law of Texas.

I make the statement, then, that we are

9

-- that this is a controversy between states without regard

10

to what the Court may ultimately say about our pending

11

motion for leave to file a new original complaint.

12

Naturally, we hope, for the reasons stated there, that the

13

Court will permit it to be filed.

14

that there are prudential or may be prudential limitations

15

on the exercise of original jurisdiction in this situation,

16

some of which were discussed by Justice Stewart in his

17

concurring opinion.

18

But we also recognize

If the Court declines on any of those grounds to

19

permit California to invoke the original jurisdiction, the

20

fact remains that Congress has not created an alternative

21

form in a district court for the litigation of controversies

22

between states which this Court declines to adjudicate.

23

This Court has turned down over the years many suits brought

24

by one state against the other.

25

The decision by the Court not to permit jurisdition

2

3 to be invoked in that case did

not automatically create

4 jurisdiction in some other court for the resolution of that
5 con troversy.

So, for those reasons, we believe Section

6

1251(a)

7 bars this action.

The second ground for objection to jurisdiction,

8

9 which of course the Court does not need
10 agrees with
11

to reach if it

the first, is a constitutional one, founded on

the Eleventh Amendment.

The Court's cases have

12 traditionally identified

13 must be satisfied

two distinct requirements which

for suit to be brought against a state

14 officer in a federal court.

First, there must be a colorable allegation that

15

16 the defendant has acted unconstitutionally or in violation
17 of

his statutory authority or her statutory authority.

18 Second,

only prospective injunctive relief is being sought,

19 or at least

that there be sought prospective injunctive

20 relief.
21

22 but

In this case, the second requirement is satisfied,
the first is not.

Here the Texas and California taxing

23 officials who are defendants are plainly acting within their
24 statutory authority,
25 Constitution.

and they are not violating the

Obviously, the domicile claim advanced by one

or the other or conceivably by both of the state taxing

2

officials is wrong on the facts, but that does not make the

3

assertion of the claim unconstitutional.

4

officials seek to do is to submit their relevant evidence to

5

a court of competent jurisdition and obtain a judicial

6

determination in that court.

7

All each of these

Worcester County Trust Company versus Riley holds

8

that this does not violate the Constitution, and that

9

portion of the opinion in that case has never been

10

questioned and was not questioned in the concurring opinions

11

in California versus Texas, and is supported by many

12

decisions of the Court.

13

Thus, one is brought to the state's principal

14

argument, that Edelman versus Jordan somehow dispensed with

15

the requirement that illegality be shown, and left only the

16

requirement that prospective relief be sought.

17

that three Justices implied in California versus Texas that

18

this was so.

19

stand for that proposition, and that indeed there is no

20

warrant for what would be a genuinely radical change in our

21

Eleventh Amendment law.

24 variety of cases theretofore barred by sovereign immunity
25 and

the Eleventh Amendment, such as suits to enjoin a breach

of contract
QUESTION;

2

You don't think this could be limited to

3 the interpleader situation?
4

MR. FALK;

Well, I don't think there is any

5 difference in principle between interpleader and other
6 cases.

As a matter of fact, in a sense, interpleader is an

7 even easier case than Larson.
8 conduct in

In Larson, there was illegal

the sense of tortious conduct, and yet the Court

9 said tortious conduct is still within the officer's
10 authority and

11

is not -- and suit may not be maintained

against him.
So, I think, in a sense this is a less close case

12

13 than a tort case would be,

as you had in Larson.

The third ground of objection I will speak to very

14

15 briefly, and that has to do with subject matter jurisdiction
16 under the Interpleader Act.

When one looks at the

17 Interpleader Act, and tries to fit it to suits of this kind,
18 the fit is very poor.

Section 1335 requires at least two

19 claimants of citizenship of diverse states, and refers to
20 the general
21

diversity statute.

23

definition of diverse citizenship in the
This requirement has been referred to as

But neither the United States nor taxing officials

24 of — or any officials of states or states themselves are
25 citizens of states, so the Act doesn't apply to them.
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

And

1

thus the court of appeals found minimal diversity here only

The court of appeals held that his

could be considered because he was an interested

7 stakeholder

in the sense that he also has a claim, was

8 therefore a

claimant, and his citizenship of Nevada could be

9 considered

as one of the two claimants for minimal diversity.

We think that was error for reasons discussed in

10

11 the brief, and

But even if

Lummis qualifies as one of the two necessary claimants,

court of appeals found that second claimant in Mr.

15 Alvord,

that is that where a party is added or deleted after a

That is, to be sure, consistent with a general

13 as the Worcester County Court held that there was nothing

7

As a matter of

8 policy, we believe that the ends of federalism would

11

with this interpleader action, because it would give

a binding determination, binding on both the administrators

12 of

the estate and on the state tax officials, and it will

13 free them from the burden of having to race to judgment, a
14 race to collection in this case, in which the assets of the

Should this Court be of the view that relief is
for states so situated,

I would suggest that the

18 district court interpleader remedy is the most suitable
19 remedy, ani

I would cover the reasons for that in just a few

20 moments, if

I may.

The district court interpleader as postulated by

22 the Fifth Circuit does permit the least broad incursion,

As the Court questioned counsel, in fact,

2 Circuit is not likely to repeat itself jurisdictionally.

3

More troublesome to the state of Texas is the

4 suggestion that this is a 1251(a) case, or an appropriate an
5 expeditious case for original action.

Simply, as Justice

It is

9 only when you have the domicile determination decided in a
10 contradictory fashion by
11

two or more states, and then you

have an appraisal of the estate that is finite, an

12 assessment of taxes

by the federal government and these

13 competing states, that you begin to get to the
14 constitutional issue, and that is, is one state grabbing so
15 many of the marbles that the other state can't satisfy its

24

MR. HARRISON:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, and I believe —

It would only be if each state or the

1

total of the two exceeded 100 percent, your submission is

2

that we don't have any federal question.

3

MR. HARRISON;

Using those percent ages as an

4

example, because the federal tax also bears an eating up of

5

the estate, but if we were only talking abo ut 100 percent

6

left, and the two states took 70 percent, I submit there

7

would be no federal question raised for thi s Court,

8

QUESTION;

It would have to be ove r 100.

9

MR. HARRISON;

It would have to be over 100

10

percent, and I would submit that even if th e Court were

11

faced with a factual analysis that showed i t, that the state

12

of Texas and the state of California had pe rfected their

13

claims and thereby one of the two states wa s not going to be

14

able to reach 1 percent of its tax, then th e Court , I

15

believe, would still be faced with the grav ity test that it

16

applies in Article III cases, and also in 1 251(a) cases, and

17

that is, is that loss of that 1 percent of sufficient

18

gravity for the Court to take it.

19

QUESTION;

I gather you agree with Mr. Falk that

domicile as a matter of the federal Constit ution is not

1

MR. HARRISON*

2

QUESTION*

Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan.

And yet I guess all 50 states, as I

3 recall it, the principle is that you can have only one
4 domicile.
MR. HARRISON*

5

I would not question counsel’s

6 representation that that is nationwide, but I can advise the

7 Court that in the states of Nevada, Texas, and California,
8 the domicile criteria is substantially

the same.

I might

9 point out that there are different gradations of test for
10 domicile which I
11

believe make it necessary to allow the

states to make their own determination.

12 Texas,

For example, in

we have a different test, and that is residents on a

13 permanent basis with no intention of leaving.

California's

14 is slightly different, present intention of remaining, and
15 that factual inquiry is not exactly the same.
16

QUESTION:

Although it may bring out -- it could

17 have the same result of one state.
18

MR. HARRISON*

Yes, but the fiction the estate

19 would ask you to indulge is the decedent in common law only
20 has one domicile, and
21

that justifies proceeding, and

bringing these states in.

By that very assumption and

22 fiction, Texas postulates -- Texas has in this case proven

23 to the satisfaction of a jury in a three-month trial that
24 Hughes was domiciled in Texas.

I simply suggest that it is

25 unlikely that California can bear that proof, and this Court
37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 should give it that go, and allow California to attempt it
2 if they can, but the situation will very likely resolve
3 itself.
4

QUESTION;

Do I understand you to be saying that if

5 we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals, that the
6 district court on remand must apply Texas law?
7

MR. HARRISON;

No.

No, Your Honor.

I did not mean

8 to leave that impression.
9
10

QUESTION;

What would it apply?

MR. HARRISON;

Federal law?

This Court asked that same question

11 when the case was h ere on o riginal action, asking, I
12 believe, what this Court wo uld apply if it took the case
13 before.

The Court would in that instance, I believe , apply

14 the fede ral common law.
15

QUESTION:

Is there a federal common law of

16 domicile?
17

MR. HARRISON;

I am presuming that there is. Your

18 Honor.
19

QUESTION:

If not, we would have to fashion one.

20 Is that it?
21

MR. HARRISON:

That might very well be, and taking

22 into consideration that law in the respective three states,

QUESTION:

So would the district court if this

8 the best intermediary between the laws of the competing
9 states.

On the question of the gravity necessary to reach

12 bill or under

1251(a),

13 record in this case
14 original bill and

I would like to point out that the

in conjunction with the record in the

that of California v.

Texas does indicate

15 that California four years ago had entered

into a

16 provisional settlement agreement with the estate agreeing
17 only take an

18 percent tax as opposed to 24 percent.

18 it postulates to this Court that it
19 the level

Now

is being aggrieved at

which requires the imposition of 1251(a)

20 jurisdiction

because it may, if quite a few different things

21 as yet unresolved happen, only get
22

to

23 of its 24 percent.

I simply point that out, that just because the

23 fiscal matters are reduced
24 because a state may lose

to a finite conclusion, and just

1 percent, the Court should still

25 examine whether that is of sufficient gravity to the estate

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

-- or to the state.

Exactly the type of a gravity question

2 that Justice Rehnquist

pointed out in the recent case of

3 Maryland versus Louisiana, that you must look to the gravity
4 of the situation.
5

Furthermore, I would point out, in the Court

6 looking at its original

jurisdiction, under either Article

7 III or Section 1251(a), there are alternate forms
8 available.

First of all, as we have pointed out, just this

9 last August, an appearance by the state of California was
10

allegedly made by the state -- was allegedly made in the

11

state probate court in Houston, Texas.

12

very time, all the parties to this proceeding have appeared,

Therefore, at this

13 we allege, in the Texas probate court, and that court has
14 personal jurisdiction to proceed.
15

If not that forum, then certainly we have the

16 alternate forums of the state courts in both California and
17 Texas, which I ask you, as we asked you four years ago, to
18 allow to proceed in this matter.
19

There is a policy reason, and I certainly wouldn't

20 preach policy to this Court, but as I glean some of the
21

reasons the Court has given for not exercising its original

22 jurisdiction in the past, one that is especially relevant to

23 a domicile determination that is such a heavily factual
24 matter, the literal investigation of a man's life, this
25 Court has pronounced that it is ill-equipped to sit as a

factfinder at the trial level, it is ill-equipped to try

2

such cases, and it could not accord to the litigants here

3

what I would perceive to be their constitutional right to a

4

jury trial.
QUESTION:

5

Do you think it is more factually

6

complicated than some of the other original jurisdiction

7

cases the Court has had over the years?
MR. HARRISON:

8
9

I certainly wouldn't presume to say

so, but it is a virtual factual nightmare, as illustrated by

10

the length of the Texas trial that has already gone before,

11

and I would just submit that the litigants should be

12

entitled to the trial level investigation of those facts in

13

a trial before a jury.

proceedings with the attendant risk of

13 inconsistent verdicts and taxation in excess of

14 of the estate assets.
15

Texas asks you to allow that latter course.

as Mr. Harrison said, the provisional settlement between

13 California and

made a number of points about it, and it elicited a

4 because the horse will be out of the barn.
And finally, there were in

5

1978 a number of

6 ancillary disputes which have since been resolved, those

7 disputes involving, for example, the so-called Mormon will,
8 Mr.

Dumar's famous will, the guestio ns of airship, a claim

9 by HHMI, the Howard Hughes Medical I nstitute, that there was
10

a will which had become lost, all of which affected the tax

11

position, and which were urged by Te xas in opposition to

12

California versus Texas as problems affecting ripeness.

13 Those problems have been resolved in the trial courts, and
14 in many instances are final.

So, al 1 of those matters have

15 been resolved.
16

Now, turning to the point I was making --

17

QUESTION;

I would think yo u would want to sustain

19 between two states.
20
21

MR. FALK:

That’s right.

But if the

MR. FALK;

MR. FALK;

14

QUESTION;

And so you destroy the interpleader,

15 which puts it right back to where it was before there was an

18 simply were wrong anyway.

8 what is the

You might ask, well,

harm if there is no interpleader, and let

9 California proceed, and let Texas proceed, and one can see

11

Th e problem is this.

12 Hughes died ,

Almost immediately after Mr.

Texas began a suit which ultimately resulted in

13 a determina tion of a Texas domicile in the Texas state
14 courts.

Ca lifornia was required by its own law to wait

15 until the e state filed its tax return, known as the IT 22.
16 That was no t done for a year and a half roughly after Mr.
17 Hughes died .

Only after the IT 22 was filed, under our law,

18 does the ai ministrative process begin which leads to the
19 judicial pr ocess.
20

By the time that judicial process was about to

21 com men ce, a n injunction had
22 cou rt which

been entered by the district

continues to this very day.

But by then, Texas

23 had it s jud gment, so these were not really parallel trains.
24 One is well ahead of the other.

And as a practical matter,

25 as we alleg e in Paragraph 26 of the proposed complaint,

which is attached to the motion for leave to file, if the

2 Fifth Circuit decision is reversed, and the stay is lifted,
3

the Texas judgment could and undoubtedly would become final

4

rather quickly, and Texas would then be in a position to

5

execute that judgment, and so by the time California was

6 able to complete its administrative and judicial process,
7

the estate could and undoubtedly would be substantially

8 depleted, and California might find very little left when it
9
10

comes to perfect its own judgment.
So, that course, from California’s point of view,

11

simply will not work, and there is thus an immediate threat

12

to California posed by the Texas judgment, and that is what

13

creates, in our view, the case or controversy proposed by

14

our motion for leave to file, which would justify allowing

15

an original suit to be brought.

There were also some questions about

Whether the controversy is resolved here or in a
