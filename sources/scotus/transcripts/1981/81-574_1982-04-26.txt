ON BEHALF CF PETITIONER

MR. POWERS:

Thank you, Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

This case is here on writ of certiorari to the

11

Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

12

proper scope of an employment discrimination class

13

action.

14

the so-called across the board approach to class

15

certification of the Fifth Circuit.

16

the claims of applicants, employees and former employees

17

can all be litigated in a single class action as long as

18

the Plaintiff alleges that he and members of the class

19

belong to the sam‘e race, sex or ethnic group and that

20

each of them has suffered in some way from an employer’s

21

discrimination against their group.

22

It involves the

The Petitioner, General Telephone, challenges

Under that approach

The facts of this case vividly illustrate why

23

that approach is wrong.

The Plaintiff, Mariano Falcon,

24

an employee of General Telephone, charged that he was

25

not promoted to a manaaement job because ha was a

Falcon also sought to represent a class of

3

Mexican-Americans who had applied for work at General

4

Telephone but had not been hired.

5

In the civil action that followed/

Without holding a hearing or stating any

6

factual support for its action, the trial court

7

certified Falcon as the sole representative of this

8

class of unsuccessful applicants.

have resulted in a denial of class certification.
For example, Hr. Falcon had never been an

12

unsuccessful applicant at General Telephone.

13

was hired when he first applied as part of the company's

14

affirmative action program.

15

claim was based on a disparate treatment theory of

16

discrimination, while the hiring claims he presented for

17

the class were based on disparate impact.

18

evidence which he introduced in support of his own

19

promotion claim w'as entirely unrelated to the hiring

20

claims of the unsuccessful applicant class.

Indeed, he

And the

21

Finally, there was a conflict in interest of

22

Falcon and the applicant class, because increasing the

23

number of Mexican-Americans employed at General

24

Telephone would have reduced Falcon's own chances of

25

receiving the management promotion he sought.

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth

2

Circuit affirms! the class certif ica tion.

3

it expressly relied on its own policy favoring across

4

the board class actions in employment discrimination

5

cases.

6

claims and the 'class claims were both based on alleged

7

discrimination against Mexican-Americans outweighed the

8

differences in the employment practices that Falcon and

9

the class were complaining of.

10

In so -*oing,

The court held that the fact that Plaintiff's

The court did declare that there was a

11

similarity of interests between Falcon's claims and

12

those of the class based upon job location, job

13

function, and other considerations.

14

the record that the jobs that were included and these

15

sought by the applicants went far beyond the management

16

job which Falcon was complaining of not being promoted

17

to, and there is no indication in the court's opinion or

18

in the record as to what other considerations may have

19

been similar between Falcon's claim and those of the

20

applicant class.

21

But it's clear from

General Telephone contends that Mr. Falcon is

22

not a proper representative of :an unsuccessful applicant

23

class, for three reasons.

24

claim was not typical of the hiring claims of the

25

unsuccessful applicant class.

First, Falcon's promotion

This Court said in

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

General Telephone of the Northwest against EEOC that

2

typicality limits the claims of the class to those that

3

are fairly encompassed in the representative's personal

4

claim.

5

That certainly was not true here.
Falcon's claim was based on a disparate

6

treatment theory, while the hiring claims were based on

7

disparate impact.

8

support of his own claim was entirely unrelated to the

9

claims of the applicant class.

10
11

And the evidence he introduced in

And so we say that

there's no typicality as required under Rule 23(a)(3).
Indeed, the differences between Falcon's

12

promotion claim and the hiring claims of the class are

13

so great that we contend ths

14

not even the necessary commc . issues of fact or law

15

required by Rule 23(a)(2).

16

in this action there is

And finally, because of these differences

17

between the claims of the putative class representative

18

and the class and because of the conflict that we have

19

referred to in th*e interests of Falcon and the class, we

20

contend that Falcon is not an adequate representative as

21

required under Rule 23(a)(4).

22

Let me restate at this time what the

23

Petitioner is seeking in this action and what he is' not

24

seeking, what it is not seeking.

25

Telephone is seeking in this action the careful

First, General

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVL., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

application of the elements of Rule 23 that this Court

2

said was required in its decision in Rodriguez.

3

not seeking a per se rule that under no circumstances

4

can an employee ever include applicants in a class

5

action which he is bringing.

6

policy that similarly discriminates against both

7

employees and applicants, if there is sufficient

8

numerocity and if there is no conflict in interest,

9

it would be possible for an employee to represent an

10

We’re

If there is a common

then

applicant.

11

But those elements are not present in this

12

case.

13

which is the careful application of Rule 23 to this

14

case, and we say if there is such a careful application

15

it will be clear that hr. Falcon --

16
17
18

And that is the second thing that we are seekino,

QUESTION:

hr. Powers, are you taking the same

position the Government takes?
UR. POWERS:

Your Honor, the Government has

19

supported our petition and

20

the Fifth Circuit across the board rule is too broad.

21

They would suggest that the Court base such a decision

22

on lack of common questions.

23

argument is similar to ours.

24
25

says- that in their judgment

We think that their

As we indicated in our reply brief, while we
think there is a lack of common questions here, we think

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that certainly there is a lack, of typicality.

2

however the Court chooses to iefine the defect, we think

3

it clear, as the Government does, that the Fifth Circuit

4

and the court below did not require the necessary

5

symmetry of claims.

6

QUESTION

But

Well, they suggest that when the

7

case is remanded that the class question be reexamined.

8

Do you agree with that?

9
10

MR. POWERS:
that.

We see no need --

11
12

We certainly do not agree with

2UESTI0N:

Your position is not the same as

the Government's.

13

MR. POWERS:

We see no need for a remand.

We

14

think the record makes clear that Falcon is not a proper

15

class representative, never was a proper class

16

representative, that the initial certification was

17

wrong, and that the proper remedy here or the proper

18

action for this Court is as the Court acted in

19

Rodriguez, which ‘is to reverse with instructions to

20

dismiss the unsuccessful applicants from the class.

21

Finally, we think it clear that the careful

22

application of Rule 23 that we .seek in this case will

23

not mean the end of employment discrimination class

24

actions.

25

identity of interests, where a policy is being attacked

As I said earlier, when there is the proper

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that affects various groups of employees and at various

2

locations, Rule 23 would support a broad class action.

3

But we contend that there is not a basis for

4

such a certification in this case and that the Court

5

should direct the lower court, the trial court, to

6

dismiss the unsuccessful applicants from this class and

7

then proceed in accordance with this Court’s prior

8

remand for consideration of Falcon’s own promotion claim

9

in the light of Perdine.

10

QUESTIONS

Mr. Powers, are you asking for any

11

more than the application of the traditional rule that a

12

class representative has to be part of the class and

13

possess the same interests and suffer the same injury?

14

MR. POWERS:

We think that's certainly the

15

core of the relief that we are seeking.

16

when you look at the three elements of Rule 23(a) that

17

we have cited, each of them provides a basis for

18

reversal in this action.

19

unsuccessful applicant, but his own claim of being

20

denied a promotion is not typical of the claims of

21

unsuccessful applicants, and we think he's not an

22

adequate class representative. •

23

We think that

Not only is Mr. Falcon not an

We have -- I would say a word also about the

24

contention in amicus brief that the writ was

25

improvidently granted.

We think nothing could be more

1

erroneous than that.

2

that Rule 23 was not properly applied.

3

Telephone tried repeatedly in the district court and

4

before the Court of Appeals to have Rule 23 properly

5

applied.

6

contention that under the Fifth Circuit's across the

7

board approach this type of action is permissible

8

despite the differences in the claims of the class

9

representative and those he's seeking to represent.

10

The record is clear in this case
General

Its contentions were always dismissed with the

There’s-no other place this employer can get

11

what it's seeking other than before this tribunal.

12

it wants is an end to this litigation of the claims of

13

applicants,

14

this class representative having any personal interest,

15

any personal experience regarding that particular

element of the litigation.

which has gone on for seven years, without

There's no question that at the time the court

trial that there ‘was sufficient- numerocity.

20

21

Court can do it.

QUESTION;

I have one.
Yes.
Is it your position that a hearinq

5

to apply the rule?

6

ME. POWERS;

No, that is not our position.

either through an evidentiary hearing or by reviewing

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

And at the time, as the brief points out, that

2

class certification issues were before the court, at

3

least in the Northern District of Texas, the way they

4

were handled was that the litigants representing the

5

respective parties met in a pretrial conference,

6

informal conference with the court to discuss potential

7

class issues.

8
9

And that was done.

The court entered an order in effect and
advised counsel for both parties that they had, I

10

believe, until October the 10th of 1975 to file their

11

brief on the class action issues.

12

Falcon, filed his brief.

13

file a brief and ieprived the court of any thinking it

14

may have had on the class action issue.

15

The Plaintiff, Mr.

The Defendant chose not to

In February of 1976, in response to

16

interrogatories propounded by the Plaintiff, the

17

Defendant answered them, and they were filed with the

18

court immediately prior to a subsequent conference with

19

the court to discduss the class action aspects of the

20

litigation.

21

Subsequently in March of 1976, after the court

22

had an opportunity to view some of the factual data

23

pertaining to the class and had an opportunity to review

24

the Plaintiff’s brief, the court entered a provisional

25

class order and clearly made it known to the Defendant

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the Defendant could

evidence, discuss,

the class action aspects of the litigation.

4

bring

It was not until after the provisional

5

certification of the class that the Defendant then did

6

something to move to try to get the class decertified.

7

It wasn't until that point.

And in that regard this

in the Northern District of Texas and I trust in other

districts throughout the country.

But this is the way it was lone at that time

and it certainly afforded the court ample opportunity to

be aware of Buie 23 and the various aspects of Rule 23

7

as she applied it to this case.

QUESTION:

Nr. Hernandez, do you contend that

an across the board approach is appropriate or do you

10

contend that the rule was -- the requirements of the

11

rule were complied with in this case?

12

KR. HERNANDEZ;

The requirements of the rule

13

were complied with.

14

developed out of the Fifth Circuit, but you don't find

15

the words "across the board” anywhere in the rule.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Across the board is a concept that

Do you think the court applied that

approach here?
NR. HERNANDEZ:

I think the court looked at

19

that aspect of it1, because we certainly argued in our

20

brief for the across the board approach, the concept

21

being that wherever you have discrimination against an

22

employee it is generally class-wide.

23

QUESTION:

Do you think that there are

24

instances where groups of employees might have

25

conflicting interests in a case like this?

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

KE. HERNANDEZ*

There possibly could be some

2

areas where you might have a conflict of interest.

3

don't thin<

4

conflict of interest was not really raised.

5

sort of an imagined conflict in the Fifth Circuit and it

6

was elevated up to an actual conflict in this Court.

7

But I think you'll find the record devoid of anything

8

that gets close to a conflict.

QUESTION;

If you multiply the number of

enlarges the pool from which promotions will be drawn.

12

Doesn't that dilute his future, as was suggested in the

13

briefs?

14

HE. HERNANDEZ;

I suppose that it would in

15

some fashion dilute it.

16

this case clearly show that, although the company may

tout its affirmative action program. Operation

20

management by objective portions was never followed or

21

actually utilized by the company.

22

Sumner, the supervisors, testified they weren't even

23

aware the affirmative action program was in effect.

But I think that the facts of

Nr. Goldston and Mr.

24

So it could, but I think that the exhibits,

25

the statistical data in this case, would clearly show

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that even as late as '75 and '76 General Telephone was

2

hiring so few Nexican-Americans that the potential for

3

conflict is very, very rare in this case.

4

QUESTION;

Well, do you think, our holding in

5

the East Texas Kotor Freight versus Rodriguez requires

6

actual conflict?

7

considerably narrower requirement than you suggest when

8

you say that virtually all discrimination cases are

9

certifiable under 23?

10

Doesn't that case lay down a

MR. HERNANDEZ;

Well now, I didn't say all

11

discrimination cases are certifiable under Rule 23, nor

12

do I say that all Title VII cases are class actions.

13

And I think that the Rodriguez versus East Texas really

14

has very little to do with the facts of Falcon.

15

are so many differences in that case factually as

16

compared to this case.

17

QUESTION;

But Rodriguez does lay down some

general principles, though, like the class

the same interest and suffer the same injury.

21

MR. HERNANDEZ;

22

QUESTION;

Exactly.

It doesn't seem to me that you

24

interests and suffered the same injury.

SR. HERNANDEZ:

That’s correct, and if you’re

8

The problem is, is

But Mr. Falcon suffered, as did the other

Do you think that would be enough?

MR. HERNANDEZ*

I don't think it's enough, but

I think it's an important factor.

those aspects, he can determine whether or not there

against black American males and females, there was

15

discrimination against females on a class-wide basis.

16

But the court didn’t give us that type of class.

individuals in terms of the Mexican-American promotion

Now, by the same token, I think that what I

20
21

would like for the Court to consider is that there is no

perfect class, that there's just not a perfect class;

23

that Rule 23 doesn’t require that you have a perfect

QUESTION:

Your argument sounds as though you

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

would reduce it to one component, without taking into

2

consideration the other factors that have been indicated

3

in our opinions.

4

HR. HERNANDEZi

No.

Your Honor, I think that

5

I would take into account all of the components under

6

Rule 23, and all of them with equal effect.

7

think, for example, that adequacy of representation in

8

this case is really an issue.

9

I don't

The Plaintiff prevailed.

And in looking at the various aspects, in

10

terms of numerocity there's no question but that

11

numerocity was fulfilled.

12

Suppose that — if we're going to limit, if

13

this Court is going to limit classes of employees who

14

can bring an action to that employee who has suffered

15

the exact same interest or same injury, then we're going

16

to have a multiplicity of litigation, and the Title VII

17

litigant will not be able to wrong these remedies.

18

that's not the purpose and the intent of Title VII.

19

And

I think, that the analogy I like to think of is

20

that if the Plaintiff with his counsel is a private

21

attorney general under Title VII, then that attorney

22

general, private though he be, cannot be, should not be,

23

limited only to the very narrow claim or charge of

24

discrimination that is filed by sometimes an

25

ill-informed, uneducated individual who knows something

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is being done wrong to him but doesn't know quite what

2

it is and perceives it to be based on race, sex,

3

national origin.

4

And so how is that private attorney general,

5

how is he regulated?

6

First, he’s regulated by the EEOC and by the charge.

7

That's where it all starts.

8

example, the EEOC, following Sanchez versus Standard

9

Brands, sent the Defendant the request for like and

He's regulated in two instances:

And in this case, for

10

related matters, to wit hiring discrimination.

11

made a finding and a determination that this Defendant,

12

this company, discriminated as a class against

13

applicants in failing to hire.

14

The EEOC

So at that point it was brought to -- this was

15

long before this lawsuit was started.

The second place where he’s regulated is by

And now, under the procedure at least in North

25

Texas, you have 90 days to file your class certification

motion, at which time all of these issues are taken up

2

not on the merits, but they're all taken up to determine

3

whether or not you can in fact sustain your burden of

4

proof preliminarily on the class.

5

to say that once a class has been established that it

6

cannot be decertified, which has occurred.

7

And there's nothing

If you're going to follow this, this area,

8

then the private attorney general should not be limited

9

to having the private -- to having a perfect class.

10

Now, in reality what's going to happen, I believe, if

11

across the board is not approved — and this was a term

12

which I said was just developed by the court -- but if

13

it’s eliminated, as General Telephone would ask you to

14

do, and this case’is reversed and not remanded, what's

15

going to happen to those 13 Plaintiffs who have now been

16

absolutely proven to have suffered discrimination?

What's going to happen?

19

How are they going to be

well, afe a plaintiff's attorney, what’s going

20

to happen is very simple to me.

You're going to have

21

Rule 23(c)(4)(B) subclasses being applied for, and

22

you're going to have counsel for the plaintiff who says,

23

well, if there is a conflict or a potential conflict of

24

such a magnitude, then I move the court to designate a

25

subclass, I move the court to appoint counsel for the

Now, I want to comment a little bit on the
question that related to the Government -QUESTION;

What you're saying is that the

12

members of thr putative class have no stand ing to amend

13

the showing, enlarge the showing, and maybe get a

14

different class representative?

15

HR. HERNANDEZ;

I think that we could try to

16

amend and get a different class representative of that

17

particular class. . I don't think that's necessary under

18

this case and I do think that Hr Falcon was an adequate

19

representative of the class.

20

You know, there have been some allusions in

21

the briefs tc the fact that the Plaintiff perhaps didn’t

22

somehow prove his case or the statistics that they put

23

into the record weren't somehow sufficient.

24

private litigant in Title VII, I have no qualms with

25

Berdine, which says you have to prove your case.

As a

I have

1

no qualms w ith NcDonnsll Douglas, which gives you the

2

four different ways, more or less, how you can rely on

3

to do the prima facie case.

4

But it escapes me how we forget that the

5

burden of proof, although it is on the Plaintiff, should

6

be no greater than the preponderance of the evidence.

7

And the preponderance of the evidence in this case

8

clearly demonstrated that this company discriminated in

17 and

Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 20, that that will not be very

4

difficult to amend or to expand upon in terms of

5

additional findings.

6

I wanted to comment a little bit on the

7

Government's position and the reason for, or at least

8

the way that I envision the reason for private attorney

9

generals.

It dea'ls with the Congressional intent of

20

Title VII and the broad-based attack.

And I gather that

21

the reason that it's called an across the board attack,

22

at least in my mind, is that because discrimination to

23

me is like a cancer, and you don’t treat cancer very

24

nicely.

25

discrimination, and that’s why they call it across the

You attack cancer and you attack

1

board, beciuss whan you find a company that

2

discriminates against an employee because she's a female

3

or because he's black or because he's a

4

Mexican-American, this is — you attack.

5

And once you do find it, then you look.

6

Generally companies -- generally companies who

7

discriminate in one area will discriminate in another.

8

It's true, you have to look and

9

there’s a central authority, one personnel office,

see whether or not

10

whether or not it-might just be one supervisor.

11

of that is done, particularly in the concept of Title

12

VII and Rule 23, by the district judge.

13

But all

The Government in its amicus has changed its

14

position, has changed its position from where it’s been

15

in Rodriguez, changed its position from where it's been

16

in other cases.

17

because that's the public attorney general and the

18

public attorney general we know is motivated not always

19

by the same motivation that private attorney generals

20

are, and that may all be well and proper.

I think it's significant that it did,

21

There are some problems with that, because

22

public attorney generals tend to change quite often.

23

Private attorney generals and litigants may not.

24

think that’s why this Court, and I think that's why

25

Congress, has recognized that you need to have both.

And I

1

Now, what we are asking is that this Court do

2

several things:

3

but it provide companies, management, with some clearcut

4

guidelines on how a district judge on a case by case

5

basis can approach the across the board, broad-based,

6

however you want to term it, challenges to employment

7

discriminati on.

8

9

that it provide not only plaintiffs,

We suggest that the same interests, same
injury requirement from Schlesinger or Rodriguez be

10

broadly viewed as'Title VII has been broadly viewed if

11

we are to reach the results envisioned by Title VII in

12

eradicating employment discrimination; and that that

13

broadness or the liberal approach to that rule be held

14

in check, so to sav, by the district judge by following

15

the reasonableness test, by looking and being able to

16

look at all the factors, not just one of the factors of

17

Rule 23, by being able to concern itself with the

18

various aspects that go into makino up whether or not

19

the claims are typical, whether or not there are common

20

questions of law and fact, whether or not there’s

21

numerocity, whether or not there’s adequate

22

representation, but that the district judge have some

23

guidelines for doing that.

We suggest that the local rule as it’s
promulgated in the Northern District under 10(b)(2) is a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

good model to follow, because it requires the litigants

2

to face the class certification issue long before you

get into the merits, and it requires it specifically by

having you as a litigant set forth, in response to the

seven different areas that it requests --

at General Telephone and we knew we could probably prove

it.

12

And when we got down tc looking at the

13

statistics and to some of the testimony, it was true in

14

certain areas.

15

look and consider the evidence.

16

And the judge didn't just merely not

I ask this Court to look at the statistical

17

evidence, look at the testimony of the EEOC investigator

18

and the Plaintiff's exhibits, look at the letters from

19

the General Services Administration which indicated in

20

1972 that this company was lacking in its employment of

21

minorities, black, Kexican-American and females,

22

particularly in managerial positions.

23

Look at the fact that in the management of

24

this company there was one Mexican-American out of 66.

25

Look at the fact that this company in the Irving

at the fact that most of the minority employees were at

2

It's also clear from the record that, while

3

Mr. Hernandez talks now about the associational injury

4

which hr. Falcon may have suffered, that he stated

5

during the trial in volume one of the record at page 355

6

that the first time that Mr. Falcon experienced

7

discrimination was when he sought to pierce the

8

management veil, as he referred to it, and he sought no

9

relief from any personal injury that he may have

10

suffered.

11

that's been advanced at this time.

12

So this I think, quite clearly is an argument

It's also clear from the record that the

13

hiring was done not by supervisors, but by people in the

14

personnel office..

15

I would note particularly that the thing that

16

it seems to the company is most needed in this area is

17

for this Court to spell out more clearly to the lower

18

courts and to litigants what Rule 23 requires in an

19

employment discrimination case.;

20

unfortunate tendency to view Rodriguez as only dealing

21

with inadequacy of representation, and not to recognize

22

that Rule 23 has other element^ that must also be

requirement.

advance their claims.

In conclusion, I would simply note that at
