ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE G. WALLACE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER/RESPONDENT

8

HR. WALLACE:

9
10 may

it please the Court:
This is two consolidated cases from the Court of

11
12

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

Appeals for the Seventh Circuit presenting questions

13 concerning the scope of

an implied exclusion from collective

14 bargaining rights under the National Labor
15 nonmanagerial employees entrusted by

Relations Act for

their employers with

16 confidential information.

The cases do not present the question that has

17

18 been before

the Court in the past concerning the drawing of

19 the line between labor and

management, which has been the

20 subject of much past controversy; but the cases are instead
21 decided on the premise that these are employees who fall on

22 the labor rather than management side of that dividing
23 line.

There is a contention to the contrary in one of the

24 cases that has not
25 and

yet been reached by the Court of Appeals

would be reached on remand if the court agrees with our

1 contentions
2

One of the cases, the Malleable case, involves an

3 assortment of 18 employees, and it's disputed whether they
4 should be included within the bargaining unit.

They’re

5 described in some detail on pages 10 and 11 of our brief.
6 won't recount all of them at this time.

I

You’ll notice that

7 included among them are four engineers, three draftsmen, and
8 a number of relatively low level employees.

We describe,

9 for example, one who earns $3.50 an hour and is essentially
10 a shipping clerk and performs such tasks as routing
11 shipments, preparing bills of lading, tracing lost
12 deliveries, and handling damage claim reports.

Another at

13 an annual salary of $10,500 handles paperwork relating to
14 shipments to and from the employer’s warehouses.

Another at

15 an annual salary of $6,400 handles correspondence and
16 telephone calls concerning difficulties with the company's
17 products and is responsible for issuing credits on defective
18 merchandise, et cetera.
19

QUESTION;

Kr. Wallace, isn’t Malleable an easier

20 case for the Government than Hendricks?
21

MR. WALLACE:

Well, perhaps so.

It certainly is

22 true that the Chamber of Commerce, which has filed an amicus
23 brief against us, confined its brief to the Hendricks case
24 and did not take a position with respect to Malleable.
25

I'm mentioning this array of employees to give

I don't think the word ’’confidential'* secretary

There is no claim in Malleable that any of the

Now, Hendricks involved only one employee as it
this Court, a personal secretary to the general
And I should say up front that ordinarily someone

25 in that position would

be found by the Board to have the

1 labor nexus that I'll be describing in a moment; but the
2 Board is a very fact-specific agency.
3 here.

It goes beyond the labels.

It made findings

It found that this

4 particular general manager had relatively little to do with
5 the setting of labor policies in this small rural electric
6 cooperative.

By and large those matters were handled by the

7 counsel for the cooperative and by the Board of Directors
8 themselves.

And to the extent the general counsel was

9 involved, the secretary simply did not have a confidential
10 relationship with him with respect to those matters.
11 did not learn of them.
12

QUESTIONi

She

She did not have access.

But wasn’t the secretary a superior on

13 the management side under Bell?
14

MR. WALLACE*

He’s definitely a manager.

He's the

15 general manager of the company.
16

QUESTION*

So he’s excluded under Bell Aerospace.

17

MR. WALLACE*

18

QUESTION:

Under Bell he is excluded.

Even though the Board wouldn’t have

19 excluded him.
20

MR. WALLACE:

The Board — that is correct, Mr.

21 Justice.
22

QUESTION:

But Bell disagreed with the Board

23

MR. WALLACE*

That is correct.

We don’t challenge

24 that here.
25

QUESTION*

This secretary was working for a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 superior who himself was excluded under Bell.
2

SR. WALLACE*

That is the situation, Sr. Justice.

3 But since virtually all employees work for the general
4 management of the company and people who are managers, that
5 in itself is not dispositive.
6 has always viewed

The question that the Board

as the key one is whether there is access

7 to confidential information that is labor related, and the
8 Board has never treated all

secretaries to any managerial

9 people as necessarily coming within the Board's definition
10

of confidential employees, although many of them do, if the

11 particular manager has any substantial
12

13

role in labor

relations matters.
But let me just say briefly that the Board in both

14 instances found that its labor nexus test was not met, and
15 therefore rejected the claims that these were confidential
16 employees as the Board has developed that doctrine as an
17 implied exception to the bargaining rights under the Act.
18 And the Court of Appeals in both instances by a 2 to 1 vote
19 denied enforcement of the Board’s orders and rejected the
20 labor nexus aspect of the Board's standard in reliance upon
21 a footnote discussion in this Court's Bell Aerospace opinion
22 of several years ago.

23

Now, the Act itself contains no reference of any

24 kind and never has to confidential employees, but almost
25 from the outset the Board has excluded from bargaining units

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 as a matter of statutory policy employees who have had
2 access to confidential labor relations information.

There

3 has been an evolution, a refinement of the Board's views on
4 this, but there is a continuum with a few bumps along the
5 way that stretches over some 40 years.

And these cases have

6 usually arisen in just the way the Malleable case has
7 arisen, as a question of defining who is to be included in a
8 bargaining unit, and the contention between the Board and
9 the employer would be about whether the employees with this
10 confidential information should or should not be included.
11 And it has always been developed as a question of excepting
12 them from collective bargaining rights rather than from all
13 possible protection under the Act's broad definition of
14 employee.
15

And another peculiarity of the Hendricks case is

16 that there are no collective bargaining rights involved, no
17 union membership involved of any kind, but an exercise of
18 another kind of protected activity, the signing of a
19 petition, which in the Board's view is a protection that
20 extends to confidential employees within the labor nexus
21 definition.

In other words, in the Board's view it really

22 doesn't matter whether the secretary in the Hendricks case
23 falls within the labor nexus definition or not; but they did
24 find that she would not, that she did not have access to
25 confidential labor relations information.

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The basis for the Board's view was early set out,

2 and we have quoted on pages 18 and

19 of our brief in an

3 opinion called Hoover Company a rationale which has really
4 not been deviated from over the years, that even though the
5 Act did not contain any such exclusion, that there is
6 adversity of interest between the union and management in
7 collective bargaining, in the settling of grievances, and
8 consequently in order to implement the statutory policy and
9 make the collective bargaining process work, the Board
10 concluded that management should not be required to handle
11 labor relations matters through employees represented by
12 unions with whom the company has to deal in either their
13 negotiations for collective bargaining or in the disposition
14 of grievances.
15

But at the same time from the very beginning the

16 Board has in a long series of cases held that access to
17 other kinds of confidential information and the entrusting
18 of other kinds of confidential information to an employee is
19 not a reason for exclusion from the full protections of the
20 Act.

We've referred to this on pages 20 and 21 of our brief

21 as the Creamery Package doctrine.

That was one of the

22 earliest cases articulating that point of view.
23 even earlier case than the Hoover case.

It was an

It was a 1941

24 decision .
25

And we have collected in Footnote 21 on page 21 of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 our brief some of the many pre-Taft-Hartley cases in which
2 the Board applied this principle to a large variety of
3 employees entrusted with confidential information.

And we

4 refer on pages 22 and 23 of our brief to two Court of
5 Appeals decisions that upheld this principle, both well
6 before the enactment of Taft-Hartley.

The one we quote is a

7 1945 decision of the Tenth Circuit, and on page 23 we refer
8 to a Third Circuit decision of 1943 likewise upholding this
9 doctrine.
10

And the rationale of it is that there is no

11 inconsistency between the rights of self-organization or
12 collective bargaining rights that are conferred by the
13 National Labor Relations Act and loyal and faithful service
14 to an employer.
15

QUESTIONi

Do you think that applies with the same

16 force to the secretary to the chief executive officer and
17 the other ten employees?
18

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I think it probably does,

Mr.

19 Chief Justice, so long as there is no access to labor

20 relations information.
21

QUESTION;

Well, is the conduct of a personal

22 secretary -- let's not worry about the titles — the number
23 one secretary to the number one executive officer of an
24 enterprise, is it compatible if that secretary is engaging
25 in activity that is totally at odds with the management

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 decisions and policies?
2

MR. WALLACE;

Well, perhaps not activity that is

3 totally at odds, but -4

QUESTION;

Well, the manager thought so

5 sufficiently to discharge her.
6

MR. WALLACE;

I really think the answer to the

7 question lies in the fundamental premise of the National
8 Labor Relations Act, Mr. Chief Justice.

The Act was adopted

9 on the premise that interstate commerce would be promoted
10 and preserved from disruption by channeling the inevitable
11 disputes that arise between labor and management into the
12 collective bargaining process and into opportunities for
13 self-organization if the employees chose to exercise those
14 opportunities for self-organization.

And denying the

15 employees this opportunity for self-organization if they
16 choose to exercise it does not eliminate the possibility of
17 differences of agreement or disputes.

It eliminates that

18 channel for expressing those disagreements.
19

And the premise of the Act was that that channel

20 has to prevent disruptions of interstate commerce and to
21 promote peace.
22

QUESTION;

You're talking now about the mass of

23 employees, aren't you?

I’m addressing my question to just

24 the number one secretary to the number one executive
25 officer, which in the aggregate in the whole United States

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 is a drop in the bucket of the labor force, is it not?
2

SR. WALLACE*

3

QUESTION!

4

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I understand that.

Barely a drop.
And we're especially talking about a

5 drop in the bucket because, as I said earlier, in most
6 instances the Board would find such a secretary to come
7 within the labor nexus.

But it feels, and I think quite

8 properly, that when someone makes a claim for the Board, it
9 can't just rely on labels; it has to see what these people
10 actually do.

And in her case she simply did not have access

11 to confidential labor-related information.
12

QUESTION;

Contrary to what would be the case with

13 secretaries to most chief executive officers.
14

MR. WALLACE;

15

QUESTION:

Exactly so, Mr. Justice White.

He's not much of a chief executive

16 officer if he doesn't have access to —
17

MR. WALLACE:

It’s an atypical case, but the

18 Board's function is to be fact-specific, and there’s
19 certainly nothing to be ashamed of in the fact that the
20 Board looked carefully at the facts here and found them to
21 be atypical.
22

QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, secretaries to top

23 management in companies deal with the problems their bosses
24 have to deal with, and if you're at the top management level

25 in the great companies — there may be several hundred of

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 them — the problems that they deal with vary from day to
2 day, and often when they arrive at their office in the
3 morning they have no idea what sort of problems will be
4 coming across their desk.
5

What does the Board do when it has a secretary

6 like that where — do they count up the days of the year and
7 decide which of those days there was some labor nexus, or
8 what does the Board do?
9

HR. WALLACE;

There doesn't have to be any

10 predominance to the labor -11

14 of that kind entrusted to the employee.

If so —

There has to be some regularity

19 of that employee's duties.

But as long as this is a part of

20 that employees' duties, then the labor nexus test applies as

21 it's been refined.
22

QUESTION;

And I just think that's the answer to it.
Mr. Wallace, on the facts of this case

23 no labor nexus at all was found.

Would this mean that

24 seniority rules would apply in the union, and if the
25 secretary had to be replaced the union would determine the

QUESTION:

Well, tell me, was there a union at all

17 here?
18

MB. WALLACE:

There was a union for other

19 employees but not for secretaries, and she wasn’t involved
20 in any effort to engage in collective activity.
21

QUESTION:

She was not within the bargaining unit

22 defined by that.
23

ME. WALLACE:

24

QUESTION:

Exactly so.

And the Board draws a line, does it

25 not, between some employees who may be confidential

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 employees so that they're excluded from being members of a
2 bargaining unit, and at the same time they may exercise
3 rights which are not available to the rank and file
4 employees?
5

HR. WALLACE:

Well, those rights are available to

6 the rank and file, I believe, Mr. Justice.

They may not be

7 available to managers of the company who have been excluded
8 from the definition of employees under the Bell Aerospace
9 opinion.
10

QUESTION:

Well, there are some employees under

11 the Board's view who may exercise rights other than
12 participating in a rank and file bargaining unit.
13

MB. WALLACE:

Yes, Mr. Justice.

But those who can

14 exercise that right can also exercise these other rights.
15 Signing the petition in the Hendricks case is a good example
16 of that; that is protected concerted activity for employees
17 whether they're in a bargaining unit or not in the Board's
18 view.
19

Now, the labor nexus test, as I say, has been

20 refined, but it reflects a reasonable interpretation of the
21 Act's fundamental premise;

that the opportunity to channel

22 disputes into the bargaining process if the employees so
23 desire as a matter of self-organization is beneficial, helps
24 to

avoid disruptions of commerce; that it by maximizing the

25 employees who can exercise that right, narrowing the implied

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 — and it's wholly implied — exclusion from rights
2 conferred by the Act to those employees who need to be
3 brought within the exclusion, because otherwise the process
4 itself would be seriously compromised.
5

QUESTION:

Did the Congress at the time of the

6 Taft-Hartley Act, Mr. Wallace, give any consideration to the
7 Board’s policy, the Board’s definition, whatever you want to
8 call it, focusing on the so-called labor nexus?
9

MR. WALLACE:

Well, I can't say that it reflected

10 a full understanding of the Board’s development of the law
11 and the reasons for it, but it did in the hearings here from
12 industry spokesmen who expressed a need for a change from
13 the Board's current policies and from spokesmen for labor
14 organizations and the Board who opposed that.
15

QUESTION:

It's the same policy today as it was

16 then, isn ' t it?
17

MR. WALLACE:

18

QUESTION:

It's essentially the same policy.

Going back to shortly after the Wagner

19 Act.
20

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

It’s been refined

21 slightly to make its application more coherent.
22

QUESTION:

Now, what hearing consideration was

23 given to this question?
24

MR. WALLACE:

In hearings in both the House and

25 Senate the question came up, and the House, as a matter of

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 fact, put into its version of the bill in the amendments to
2 the definition of employees covered by the Act, exclusions
3 for confidential employees, broadly defined, and for
4 employees working in labor relations departments; and to
5 that extent reflected the view that had been espoused in the
6 hearings that the premise of the Act that I have been
7 referring to should to that extent be revised or repudiated
8 because of the need to assure the keeping of
9 nonlabor-related confidences.
10

The opposing argument, and it was made with great

11 strength during the hearings and on the floor in the House
12 -- the matter never reached the floor in the Senate because
13 it was cut off in the committee; the committee never
14 proposed doing anything like this to the floor of the Senate.
15

But the countervailing argument that was made is

16 that there is nothing about membership in a labor
17 organization or the exercise of bargaining rights that
18 enhances whatever motivation there may be because of
19 disputes with the employer to betray or not honor
20 confidences that aren't related to labor-management
21 relations.

If anything, the premise of the Act is that by

22 channeling frustrations into the bargaining process there’s
23 going to be more peace between labor and management.

And

24 someone denied bargaining rights may be just as bitter or
25 just as frustrated or just as tempted to betray another kind

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of confidence and —
2

QUESTION;

Well, what happened to the proposal in

3 the House?
4

MR. WALLACE;

In essence, the House receded to the

5 Senate’s version which did not include this.
6

QUESTION;

Was this in conference or was this —

7

MR. WALLACE:

It emanated from the conference.

8 The two houses passed different versions of the bill, and
9 the House receded with considerable explanation.
10

The principal point that I have been trying to

11 lead up to is that the Board's interpretation and its
12 narrowing of the exclusion to fulfill the purposes of the
13 Act is one that ordinarily would be entitled to deference.
14 It’s a consistent, reasonable interpretation of the Act,
15 unless Congress has in some way revised it.

The only

16 contention that's made in this case is that Congress revised
17 it in the Taft-Hartley Act, which was really amendments to
18 the National Labor Relations Act passed in 1947.
19

And the more I have looked at the legislative

20 materials that are pertinent and considered them in
21 preparing this case, the more firmly I am convinced that the
22 simplest and truest answer to that contention and the
23 dispositive answer is that even though there was
24 consideration of this question during Taft-Hartley,
25 ultimately Congress did not enact anything on the subject.

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 And one simply cannot amend a statute by committee
2 explanations or explanations on the floor about why no
3 amendment was being put before the Senate or the House for a
4 vote.

That is not anything that rises to the level of an

5 exercise of the lawmaking power under Article I of the
6 Constitution.
7

QUESTION:

But if you're having a general overhaul

8 of appeal of the law, certainly explanations of a conference
9 committee as to why something was not included are entitled
10 to some deference, are they not?
11

MR. WALLACE;

They’re entitled to great deference

12 with respect to anything that the Congress has enacted, Mr.
13 Justice.

It seems to me that that is the fundamental

14 difference between this case and Bell Aerospace.

Congress

15 ultimately decided to take action with respect to defining
16 the line between labor and management with respect to
17 overruling the Packard Motor Company case.

It enacted a

18 provision defining supervisors and excluding them from the
19 Act.
20

Now, it's true that that provision was not as

21 comprehensive in dealing with management as it might have
22 been, and this is why the Court divided 5 to 4 in the Bell
23 Aerospace case.

But that enactment was based on premises

24 that led to an interpretation of something Congress enacted
25 in Bell Aerospace.

QUESTION;

It seems to me this argument is

2 somewhat inconsistent with the position the Labor Board
3 takes with regard to the national policy in favor of
4 industrywide bargaining in a case coming down the line
5 shortly here.

The failure to prohibit it, in that case the

6 Government argues, evidenced a national policy in favor of
7 it.
8

KR. WALLACE:

Well, it evidences a willingness of

9 Congress not to disturb the way the Board has been
10 administering the Act.

It seems to me that that's wholly

11 consistent, and that's precisely what I'm arguing;

that

12 whatever explanations were made in committee and on the
13 floor and whatever ambiguities or misconceptions they may
14 have reflected about the state of the law at that time -15 and we really quarrel with the contention that they have to
16 be read as a misconception.

The usual presumption is that

17 Congress knew what the law was, and I think they can be read
18 consistently with that.
19

But whatever misconception there may have been,

20 still what ultimately was put to the membership of each body
21 was the proposition that the Board is handling this all
22 right, and therefore we have not included anything on this.

23 And Senator Taft's explanation as he introduced the
24 conference report to the Senate -- and he was the master
25 strategist — was that this was an area of controversy that

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 we are avoiding here.

The obvious strategem was to keep as

2 much consensus as possible.

He had his eye on other reforms

3 that he wanted to have made.

He knew that there would be a

4 veto, that he had to have a broad consensus to override a
5 veto; and this is why the Senate never reported this out in
6 the first place, after the hearings which revealed the
7 dissension on this issue, and this is part of the
8 explanation that he made in introducing it.

If I had time I

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARREN D. KREBS, ESQ.,

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT/PETITIONER

23

MR. KREBS:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

24 Cou
25

First, I would like to comment that I am the

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 general counsel who is referred to in the presentation for
2 the REMC, and I can assure the Court and it was not found by
3 the Board that I was not, as the out-house counsel with an
4 office 25 miles away from the cooperative, in charge of
5 their labor relations, and neither were the directors of the
6 REMC which are farmers elected by the consumers.

In fact,

7 the Court may want to look at a part of the testimony which
8 is included in my brief at page 42 at the top in which the
9 discharged secretary herself testified that the general
10 manager had general responsibility for all the labor
11 relations of all the employees, union employees as well as
12 those in the office.
13

The basic issue is a very simple one, and that is

14 whether the Board should be compelled to recognize the
15 written intent of Congress as expressed in the House report
16 that there are certain positions in management for employees
17 loyal to management in positions of trust and confidence,
18 and that these employees should not be subject to influence
19 or control by labor unions or by other employees.

Or

20 whether is the question shall we recognize the intent of the
21 Board, which is spelled out I think explicitly in its brief
22 in this case in reply brief, that the intent of the Board is
23 to expand its jurisdiction into every area and to include
24 Employees under the rights of the Act and the Act's
25 coverage, which was never anticipated by Congress in 1947.

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

As the Court is aware, the Taft-Hartley Act in

2 1947 was basically passed because of the problems that
3 Congress was having with the jurisdictional questions of the
4 Board from the Wagner Act, and most of the Act or a great
5 deal of it is for the purpose of curtailing that
6 jurisdiction .
7

I think the --

QUESTION*

Mr. Krebs, can I interrupt with one

9 broad question similar to one Justice Rehnquist asked your
10 adversary.
11

MR.

KREBSs Yes.

12

QUESTION*

Do you think in terms of legal analysis

13 there’s any difference between the two cases?

Does the

14 confidential rationale, if it's valid, cover that whole
15 group of employees in the other case just as much as the
16 secretary in this case?

They don't now,

but they used

Personal secretaries, individuals that have this close

5

QUESTION*

Well, it isn’t the close relationship,

6 at least under the Court of Appeals rationale, that’s
/controlling; it's the access to confidential information.
8

QUESTION;

9

MB. KREBS;

10

QUESTION;

Of any kind.
Of any kind.
That’s secret formulas and customer

11 lists and all that.
12

MR. KREBS;

That’s true.

That’s true.

I think

13 the only way that the Board can rationalize its conclusion
14 in the Hendricks case can be seen by its response to the
15 issue presented in the cross petition for cert by Hendricks,
16 which issue was that the Seventh Circuit had erroneously
17 concluded that the Board had decided that this secretary was
18 not employed in a labor relations

or personnel department

19 capacity.
20

And the only response of the Government to that

21 cross appeal,
22 decision by

they concede that there was no express

the Board, but they say that that impliedly was

23 made because the Board had concluded that she was not a

24confidential employee.

And that basically is the crux of

25 how the Board has over the years since

1957 limited the

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 exclusions; and that is, they have combined two separate and
2 specific exclusions which are contained in both the summary
3 of Senator Taft given on the floor of the Senate when the
4 bill was passed and in the House conference committee report
5 written by Congressman Hartley.

And that is that there were

6 two separate exclusions that both felt existed at that time,
7 and that is, the labor relations personnel employment area
8 exclusion, and separate, the confidential exclusion.
9

And the Board has over the years co-mingled the

10 two and come up with the confidential labor relations
11 exclusion; and that effectively terminates the effectiveness
12 of both exclusions.

And that is the only way that one can

13 reach the result in Hendricks especially that this personal
14 secretary to the chief executive officer of the company is
15 included under the Act and has rights as any other employee
16 when he was specifically on the labor negotiating committee,
17 a point that the Board previously in 1957 in the Ethel case
18 found sufficient to exclude a secretary when he was the
19 ultimate resolver of grievances at the company, even though
20 the Court previously in the GM case in

1943 excluded

21 numerous individuals.
22

QUESTION:

But if the Court agreed with your

23 position in the cross petition, you could win and the
24 Malleable case could go the other way.
25

SR. KREBS:

I think that’s probably true.

Krebs, if you

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 secretary, merely being a personal secretary is not enough
2 to exclude her?

You’d say on this record, in any event

3 under your cross petition, her situation and the general
4 manager's satisfied the labor nexus test.
5

HR. KREBS*

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. KREBS*

I think that’s my position.
Yes.
As to the Court's decision in Bell

8 Aerospace, it's very specific that this Court found that
9 there were two exclusions intended by Congress, and
10 specifically stated that among those impliedly excluded were
11 persons working in labor relations personnel and employment
12 areas, and "confidential employees."
13

The dissenting opinion written by Justice White in

14 that case did not disagree with that point.

And in fact,

15 Justice White said that the House manager's statement
16 accompanying the conference committee report explains that
17 the Act was not amended expressly to exclude labor relations
18 and confidential employees.
19

The five separate Circuit Courts of Appeals have

20 also concluded that these are separate exclusions, and
21 perhaps beginning with the 1966 decision in the D.C. Circuit
22 in Retail Clerks International written by now Chief Justice
23 Burger that these individuals are more closely aligned with
24 management regardless of any labor relations department type
25 classification.

1

QUESTIONS

How many of those five circuits decided

2 their cases after Bell Aerospace?
3

HR. KREBSs

Each one of the cases that I have were

4 decided prior to, and one of them was the Circuit Court's
5 decision in Bell Aerospace which was affirmed by this Court
6 in * 74.
7

I think the main crux of the issue comes also

8 down, as far as recognizing the difference in these
9 exclusions, in Footnote 12 to the Bell Aerospace decision in
10 which this Court specifically stated regarding confidential
11 employees that these are people who receive from their
12 employers information that not only is confidential but also
13 is not available to the public or to competitors or to
14 employees generally.
15

QUESTION;

Do you regard that as dictum in that

16 case?
17

MR. KREBS;

I think that is dictum in the case,

18 but I think it’s very important dictum because the issue
19 there was the Board had taken the labor nexus standard and
20 had attempted to limit managerial employees by the same
21 standard that they've attempted to limit confidential
22 employees.
23

And the Court -QUESTION;

Well, if you rely on Bell Aerospace,

24 you must rely on that dictum, must you not?
25

MR. KREBS;

Beg your pardon?

HR. KREBS:

6 personnel and confidential personnel.

QUESTION:

8 disagrees with that.

But I don't know that the Board
You wouldn't say that just because —

9 you wouldn't say that every secretary for every person who

Every secretary for an individual

13

QUESTION:

14 confidential.

I think that’s the —

Well, no, it is not.

It's

It has to be a confidential secretary, one

15 that has access to confidential labor relations information.

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

So it just isn't — you

19 exclude the secretary because that person is engaged in
20 labor relations.

MR. KREBS:

22 relations is.
23

QUESTION:

24 confidential part of it.
25

MR. KREBS:

That's right.

It is separate.

MR. KREBS*

3

That's true.

So I don’t see anything that the Hoard

4 is — I don't see that there is any denial in the Board's
5 position that they are two separate concepts.
6

MR. KREBS*

Well,

I think there is in limiting the

7 confidential exclusion to the labor relations nexus only and
8 not considering other situations.
9

QUESTION:

Well, that's just an argument that the

10 Board should give a wider scope to the confidential issue.
11

MR. KREBS*

An example is their decision in 1980

12 in the Missouri Valley Hospital Employees case in which they
13 held that the personal secretary to the president of the
14 company could
15 decision in

join a labor union; and they made this

1980.

16 delegated most of

And the rationale was the president had
the areas of labor relations to other

17 individuals within the corporate structure,
18 his secretary could be a
19 they

20

and therefore,

member of the union, which is what

found, although perhaps somebody else's could not be.
QUESTION*

Perhaps that's wrong, and perhaps you

21 should win on your cross petition.

That certainly doesn't

reach the notion that every confidential employee in the
3 company should be excluded.
4

MR. KREBS*

I think the intent of the Congress as

25 placed in the House report was that they looked at

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 individuals who ware involved in areas of highly, and they
2 did use that term, highly confidential areas of the
3 company.

And the company would not —

4

QUESTION;

5

HR. KREBS;

Are professionals excluded?
Professionals are a different category

6 under the Act, to my understanding.
7

QUESTION;

Well, they are dealt with specifically,

8 aren’t they ?
9

HR. KREBS;

They are dealt with, as I understand

10 it, under a different provision of the Act, not the
11 confidential provision.
12

QUESTION;

But they certainly have — some of them

13 have confidential information and some of them don’t.
14

HR. KREBS;

15

QUESTION;

That’s true.

Some of them could have.

Well, but they are not excluded even if

16 they have confidential information, are they?
17

MR. KREBS;

18

QUESTION;

I don’t believe they are.
Well, does that do anything to your

19 argument or not?
20

MR. KREBS;

Well, I guess back to the confidential

21 part of it is the very interesting item, and Congress in the
22 Hartley report, which is the House report, in discussing

23 this and why they didn't want to just limit it to labor
24 relations said that it shouldn't be up to the good faith of
25 the Board or the unions to decide what information is going

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to get out of the company.
2

Now, the argument on the other side to that is the

3 company has a right to discipline employees who leak out
4 confidential information.

And that is well and good except

5 when one takes into consideration the Board's decision in
6 1980 in the Texas Instruments case, which luckily was
7 reversed by the First Circuit in 1981, and that decision was
8 employees who are in the process of organizing had the right
9 to distribute on the street corner the confidential
10 information of the company, even though there was a valid
11 plant rule against such disclosure, because we were
12 interfering with their rights, and therefore the company
13 committed an unfair labor practice in dismissing those
14 employees.
15

And I think that reflects the notion of Congress

16 in 1947 that we cannot depend upon the Board or upon the
17 unions or the employees to insure that certain types of
18 highly confidential information, which the Board said it was
19 confidential, will not be disclosed to the general public or
20 to competitors.
21

The interesting part, I think, about the position

22 of the Government is that they have also argued in this case
23 in my opinion at least two separate standards for the
24 exclusion.

In the reply brief at page 13 they indicate that

25 in their opinion secretaries to all persons with managerial

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 functions in the field of labor relations are excluded.
2 That is not the position that they presented in the initial
3 brief or the position that they held in the Hendricks case.
4

In the Hendricks case the Board specifically held

5 that she was not excluded because her duties did not involve
6 her in a confidential capacity with her employer's
7 responsibility with respect to labor relations policies as
8 opposed to labor implementation or the grievance procedure
9 in the company.
10

There are two separate standards included even in

11 the briefs of the Board in this specific case, and I cannot
12 reconcile the two.

But I think it highlights the confusion

13 in this area that has been recognized by the courts in the
14 Retail Clerks case in 1976, again by Chief Justice Burger,
15 where he recognized, and five other Courts of Appeals have
16 made the same decision subsequent to 1966, that prior to
17 1966 the Board had a separate strand of, for lack of a
18 better term, managerial employees which they had always
19 excluded.

These employees did not have confidential

20 information, were not involved in labor relations or the
21 formulation of any other policies.

But the reason for the

22 exclusion was that they were so aligned or related to
23 management to place them in a potential conflict of interest
24 between labor on the one hand and management on the other;
25 and therefore, the Board had always excluded these types of

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 people, although they didn't give them a categorical name.
2

And I think that is precisely the type of people,

3 and a couple of the Circuit Courts in discussing this have
4 used the term "confidential employee” as synonymous with
5 those employees aligned and related to management to have a
6 potential conflict of interest.
7

So I think that there are two viable exclusions.

8 Both should be recognized by the Court.
9 recognized in the Bell case.

Both were

The Court specifically said in

10 the Bell case that the confidential — in the dictum that
11 the confidential exclusion was not limited to just
12 confidential and labor relations, because if the Court had
13 ruled that way, then the premise of the Board that
14 managerial limitation exclusion should also be limited by
15 labor relations was also correct, which of course in

1974 by

16 a 5 to 4 decision the Court held that that was not true.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUSS R. MUELLER, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT/PETITIONER

5

MR. MUELLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

6 the Court, a brief summary of what has been said.
7 is simple.

The issue

It is determining the legal standard that should

8 be applied to the confidential exclusion of employees from
9 the National Labor Relations Act.

The Board’s position is

10 that the labor nexus test should apply, namely, whether the
11 employee is in a confidential work relationship with a
12 specifically identifiable managerial employee responsible
13 for labor relations policy.
14

The lower court in the Hendricks case rejected

15 that labor nexus test and applied their decision in the
16 Hendricks case to the Malleable case.
17 going to be
18 given

This controversy is

resolved by this Court by the interpretation

to the legislative history of the 1947 amendments to

19 the National Labor Relations Act.

This Court dealt with

20 that history, legislative history in the
21 case.

Bell Aerospace

Namely, in Footnote 12, the Court said, in effect,

22 the discussion of confidentil employees in

both the House

Conference reports unmistakably refers to that term

in the House bill, which was not limited just to

MR. MUELLER:

10 to

SR. MUELLER:

I would say that one might be able

reach that conclusion; however, after Footnote 12, the

11 Court, the Court emphasized

that therefore, since

12 confidential employees are impliedly excluded from the Act,
13 obviously managerial employees are paramount to them and
14 they therefore should also be excluded.

15

The definition of confidential employees as

16 defined in the House bill was
17 information

of a confidential nature for use in the

18 interests of the employer,
19 public,

"those employees given

which is not available to the

not available to competitors, or not available to

20employees generally.”

QUESTION:

8

HR. HUELLER:

I will concede that if the substance

9 of Footnote 12 as it reads on its face is changed by this
10 Court, that at least to the extent that Malleable is
11 concerned, we lose, because the underpinnings of our
12 position is Footnote 12, because in Malleable, the
13 confidential employee claim rests on non-labor relations
14 information, such as prices, profit margins, costs, customer
15 information, the type of information that unions in labor
16 contract negotiations would be very much interested in.

17

However, just because a union is a collective

18 bargaining agent does not entitle them to that information.
19 The prevailing law is that they only have that information

20 if the employer voluntarily gives it to them in contract
21 negotiations, or if the employer makes a plea of poverty,
22 and then even when the employer makes a plea of poverty in
23 negotiations, then the right to search financial records of
24 the employer need be restricted by the employer to the

25 extent of requiring the search to be done by a CPA

QUESTION:

Mr. Mueller, may I ask you a general

What happens in defense industries that have

6 example.

Take the STEALTH aircraft, for

I don't know the contractor that is working on

7 that, but Number One, is there a union, or when there are
8 unions, are any employees excluded because of confidential
9 information to which they have access?
10

MR. MUELLER:

I would say that, without referring

11 to a particular case but just generalizing, that under the
12 present Board law, no, they would not be.
13

QUESTION:

Are there any cases —

14

MR. MUELLER:

The Board hasn't been entirely

15 consistent in this regard, because even under their
16 presently professed consistent standard, they do make
17 variations in this area when the information gets
18 particularly sensitive.
19

QUESTION:

You are saying in substance that the

20 Board relies on the labor nexus even in the most sensitive

21 defense work?
22

MR. MUELLER:

The Board shows evidence of taking

23 into consideration these areas of sensitivity.
24 then in terms of alignment with management.

We have to look at the type of

MR. MUELLER;

That is not availab le to the public,

And it has to be

If i t meets that

16 test, yes, but that doesn't exclude, for in stance, if we go

18 engineers, that wouldn’t exclude junior eng ineers, senior
19 engineers -20
21 are

22

QUESTION:

It doesn't exclude them because they

professionals, I take it.
MR. MUELLER:

Well, but you could also have a

23 professional with access to confidential information who
24 would be excluded as confidential, which leads me to point
25 out that the representation of Malleable as including an

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 array of confidential exclusions isn't quite accurate,
2 because most of those, in fact the vast majority of those
3 claims are also claimed to be managerial exclusions under
4 Bell Aerospace, and the fact that they have confidential
5 information is used, in regard to the managerial contention,
6 is used to show their alignment with management as a
7 managerial exclusion.

The same could apply to treatment of

8a professional employee.
9

The point is that the prevailing law relative to

10 unions not having access to this type of financial
11 information, profits, costs, capital and expense budgets,
12 unless there is a plea of poverty, the point is that that
13 prevailing law should not be diluted by adopting the narrow
14 standard of the labor nexus, because obviously the effect of
15 that is, if you have an employee represented by the union
16 who has access to this sensitive financial data, the
17 information

could very well find its way to the union,

18 contrary to

the union’s inability to get it unless the

19 employer would voluntarily choose
20 in

to share it with the union

contract negotiations, or unless they make a plea of

21 bargaining.
22
23 type of

Management is entitled to the security of that
financial information, and also the loyalty of the

24 employees who have access to it,

and therefore, as

25 confidential employees, they should be excluded from the

1 protection of the entire Act, not just the collective
2 bargaining aspects of it.
3

QUESTION;

Your time has expired now, Mr.

4 Mueller.

Let me ask. you just one question, though.

Would

5 the employer have some disciplinary reach over an employee,
6 even a member of the union covered by the Act, who had
7 violated the confidentiality?
8

MH. MUELLER;

Yes, and I believe, if memory serves

9 me correctly, the Board and the amicus briefs of the unions
10 make that point to the Court.

However, it is our position

11 that the burden should not be placed upon the employer to
12 police this area, when the law should be the area that takes
13 care of that situation.

For instance, the consideration in

14 terms of discharge, particularly when you are dealing with
15 confidential employees, or let’s say management employees,
16 you have an investment in those employees.

They have

17 something to contribute that is substantially more to the
18 ongoing management function.
19

QUESTION;

No, but even if the employee is

20 excluded from the bargaining unit, the employer has got the
21 same stake in his keeping his mouth shut, and he is going to
22 have to police his own rules.
23

MR. MUELLER;

If indeed this Court should adopt a

24 standard for determining confidential employees which allows
25 employees with access to that type of sensitive financial

to be part of the bargaining unit, yes, then the

3

QUESTION:

Well, even if he is not part of it, he

4 is going to have to police his own rules.
5

MR. MUELLER:

Except I believe that begs the

6 question.

QUESTION:

It does not.

Whether he is in the

Except that we then get back to the
