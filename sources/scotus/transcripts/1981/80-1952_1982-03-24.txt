ORAL ARGUMENT OF JUDITH A. GORDON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MRS. GORDON*

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
New York's alleged involvement in medical

10

decisions about nursing home care for Medicaid patients

11

was found below to constitute state action in two kinds

12

of circumstances.

13

circumstances in which state action was found to be

14

present is necessary because that inquiry determines the

15

additional question petitioners raise in this case; that

16

is, the district court's jurisdiction under Article III

17

to decide the claims that are now before you, and also,

18

it aids the inquiry, the state action inquiry, in the

19

event the court reaches that inquiry.

20

A brief review of the kinds of

The first circumstance in which state action

21

was found to be present occurs when a patient’s outside

22

physician, or a physician on the staff of a nursing

23

home, decides to decrease or increase the level of the

24

patient's care because his condition has become worse or

25

because it has become better.

In our brief, we refer to

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the decision of the nursing home staff physician as a

2

nursing home decision or trasfer, and we refer to the

3

decision of the outside physician as the decision of a

4

private physician, albeit both of those decisions are

5

private action within the constraints of the court of

6

appeals* decision below.

7

The second circumstance in which state action

8

was found to be present occurs when a utilization review

9

committee or a physician member of that committee

10

decides to increase a patient’s level of care because

11

his condition has become worse.

12

should be noted that utilization review is a

13

federally-required peer review system, that a

14

utilization review decision about a change in care for a

15

patient who is already in a nursing home is made during

16

a portion of that process called continued stay review,

17

and the continued stay review is addressed to whether or

18

not the patient needs nursing home care at all, and if

19

he does, what kind of care he needs.

20

Parenthetically, it

Two further points with respect to utilization

21

review, and that is the utilization review physician's

22

decision to change a level of care is final once made if

23

it is not opposed by the patient's own physician, and

24

that requirement is specific to the federal regulations

25

which are found at 42 CFR 556.336, and 442 CFR 556.436,

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and the state regulations track the federal regulations

2

in that regard.

3

In addition, if the utilization review

4

physician decides that the patient needs this upward

5

change in level of care and his decision is opposed by

6

the patient's private physician, if two utilization

7

review physicians agree, then the decision of the

8

utilization review committee becomes final, again, under

9

the regulations that I just called to your attention.

10

QUESTION*

How much time do these physicians

11

spend in this process as compared with the time they

12

spend taking care of the patients?

13

MRS. GORDON*

Well, Your Honor, if you look at

14

42 CFR 456.330 following which describes these varous

15

utilization review procedures in quite tedious detail, I

16

think you would have to conclude that he spends a great

17

deal of time.

18

exact estimate, but certainly we have no indication that

19

the physicians who serve on these committees are not

20

attending to the care of their patients, at least in

21

this record.

22

However, I can't, in fact, give you an

Petitioners contend that the district court

23

should never have reached the transfers that are at

24

issue and that I just described with respect — in the

25

circumstances I just described.

And that is because

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

there was no plaintiff and no class representative

2

before the district court who could have raised the

3

issues.

4

transfer or was threatened with such a transfer, there

5

certainly was no one who had the reality or the prospect

6

of the kind of distinct and palpable injury that Article

7

III requires.

8

10
11

Not only was there no one who had such a

QUESTION:

But there was a case or controversy

of some kind at the time the case began?
MRS. GORDON:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

There

was a case or controversy with respect --

12

QUESTION:

About some other kinds of movements.

13

MRS. GORDON:

Exactly.

There was a case or

14

controversy with respect to the claims of the name

15

respondents and the named intervenors, and that case or

16

controversy rested on their claims that you URC's had

17

improperly transferred them to lower levels of care.

18

Not URC's —

19

QUESTION:

And that dispute was settled?

20

MRS. GORDON:

That dispute was the initial

21

predicate in this case, it was initially decided by a

22

preliminary injunction back in January of 1978, it went

23

up to the court of appeals in the first court of appeals

24

in this case and it was ultimately resolved as you

25

indicate on October 17, 1979 by the first partial final

judgment in this case, which was entered

2

QUESTION:

3

MRS. GORDON:

4

In the district court?
Yes, it was resolved in the

district court.
QUESTION:

5

Then why didn’t the case end there?

I

MRS. GORDON:

6
7

Your Honor.
QUESTION:

8
9

Did you ask the court to end it

then?

10

MRS. GORDON:

11

QUESTION:

12

Pardon me?

Did you ask the court to end the

case then?
MRS. GORDON:

13
14

That is exactly my question.

No, Your Honor, the assistants

then —

15

QUESTION:

16

litigated these other issues?

17

And you went right ahead and

MRS. GORDON:

That is correct. Your Honor.

18

The assistants handling the case at that point did

19

indeed go ahead and litigate these other issues through

20

the court of appeals and to this court on the petition

21

here today.

22
23

QUESTION:

And you are raising a case or

controversy here for the first time?

24

MRS. GORDON:

25

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

But you submitted these issues in

WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 *2021 554-2345

1

the court of appeals.

I mean, you litigated those

2

issues without objection in the court of appeals.
MRS. GORDON;

3

The issues, the merits of the

4

issues were indeed litigated without objection in the

5

court of appeals, and I would add one point to that.

Your Honor.

preparation of the petition for certiorari in this case,

8

and Mrs. Siegel was then solicitor general of the state

9

of New York — she is no longer — and we, myself and

When it came time to consider the

10

the assistants who aided me, reviewed the record in this

11

case which was quite lengthy, we came to the conclusion

12

that the Article III question was fairly presented by

13

the record.
We also observed that it had not been raised

14
15

before and we had detailed conversations with Mrs.

16

Siegel as to whether or not we should call it to your

17

attention.

18

that we could not, consistent with the standards of our

19

practice, fail to call them to your attention, lest this

20

Court reach the merits of the case involving

21

constitutional rulings, which was not adequately

22

presented in terms of Article III.

23

The conclusion of those conversations was

QUESTION;

Counsel, if the question were

24

properly before the lower courts, dealing with the

25

transfer to a higher level of care, would New York have

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

stipulated eventually to the procedures for handling

2

them as was done on transfers to lower level of care?

3

MRS. GORDON*

That is a very interesting

4

point/ Your Honor.

5

describe briefly what the state policies were before the

6

judgment on review came up.

7

with respect to URC transfers to higher levels of care,

8

which you just called to my attention, was that those

9

transfers would be, in effect, advisory.

10

At page 14 of our main brief we

One of the state policies

In other words, the state of New York, the

11

Medicaid authorities, would not change the level of

12

benefits based on a URC decision* it would simply await

13

what the doctor did, what the DRC did.

14

ultimately got transferred by virtue of that UPC

15

decision, then it would adjust the benefits.

16

not, if the patient did not get transferred, they would

17

leave the benefits intact.

18

If the patiently

If it did

Now, aside from substantial equity problems

19

that were involved in that policy which was, of course,

20

superseded by this judgment; namely, there were people

21

in nursing homes who in fact needed a much more

22

intensive level of care and were not receiving it, that

23

being one of the equities on a change of policy side.

24
25

The federal government came along and advised
us that although they had required hearings on UPC

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

transfers to lower levels of care, that our FFP, our

2

federal financial participation, was in serious jeopardy

3

if we avoided hearings on higher levels of care.

4

the letters with respect to that appear in the second

5

supplement to the Joint Appendix, which includes some

6

letters referred to in petitioner’s brief -- pardon me,

7

respondents' brief — at page 4, note 4.

8

9

And

In other words, respondents refer to a letter
by Commissioner Blum to the federal authorities saying

10

can't we please give hearings on URC transfers to higher

11

levels of care now, since you already told us there is a

12

program requirement — not as a constitutional

13

requirement — that we have to give them on transfers to

14

lower levels of care.

15

second supplement to the Joint Appendix.

16
17
18

QUESTION;

That is the first letter in the

All right, so your answer is no

from advice of the federal government.
MRS. GORDOKi

Right.

The answer from the

19

federal government was that they did not perceive that

20

to be an effective way of utilization review, at least

21

for transfers to higher levels of care.

22

QUESTION»

You have, I think, taken the

23

position in your brief that private transfer decisions

24

for patients in nursing homes are medical decisions

25

unaffected by the state.

Now, what about a decision by

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the nursing home itself to transfer, when made by

2

someone other than a physician?

3

decision?

4

MRS. GORDON:

Is that a medical

Well, it can be or it cannot be
And as I

5

depending on how -- what the facts are.

6

indicated, we do not have any plaintiffs who present the

7

facts that would support those kinds of conclusions.

8
9

However, when we viewed this judgment, we
thought of it as pertaining really only to medical

10

decisions; decisions by a nursing home’s medical

11

director and therefore medically predicated.

12

There is a possible other reading which

13

plaintiff — which respondents point out essentially at

14

page 22 of their brief and throughout their brief, that

15

a nursing home, not through its medical director but

16

through its administrator, might want to discharge

17

somebody because he is a bad patient, or for some other

18

non-medical reason.

19

Now, those discharges, in fact, present this

20

case in microcosm, because those kinds of discharges are

21

covered by something called the patient's bill of

22

rights, which is codified in federal regulations and

23

codified in state regulations.

24

rights says is, if you were transferred by your nursing

25

home, — presumably a human being who has made a

And what that bill of

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

decision who is affiliated with the nursing home.

2

you were transferred for non-medical reasons, for

3

non-payment, for your own welfare, you have a right to

4

challenge that nursing home decision.

If

You do not have a right to bring a Medicaid

5

6

reimbursement claim against the state in a fair hearing

7

to get money; that does not do you any good.

8

right to bring a private action against the nursing

9

home.

You have a

And we suggest to you that the kinds of medical

10

decisions that are at issue in this case, made as they

11

are by these private URC's, the facility medical

12

director, the staff physician, your outside physician,

13

present exactly the same kind of private transactions as

14

the purely -- as respondents call them — the purely

15

non-medical needs decisions, and that the remedy for

16

these, if there is to be a remedy, is against the people

17

who made the decisions.

18

to pay you money for a service that an individual in the

19

private sector has already refused to provide you.

20

QUESTION:

Not in a request to the state

Let me ask you one more question

21

while you are interrupted.

22

those made by private physicians, have to be made by

23

applying state-defined criteria?

24

MRS. GORDON:

25

Do transfer decisions, even

The state prescribes the use of

what respondents have called and what are, in fact, a

2

— they are not referenced in respondents' briefs, but

3

they can be found in Appendix C1 to Volume C of Title X

4

of the New York Code Rules and Regulations.

5

displayed there in full.

6

Those forms can be found

They are

Now, the state has prescribed those forms, and

7

what those forms consist of are, one, a standard sheet

8

which assigns — in fact, the sheet is called New York

9

State Numerical Standards Master Sheet.

10

DMS-9 form.

11

State Long-Term Care Placement form.

That is the

And the DMS-1 form is called the New York

12

And what those forms do is describe certain

13

kinds of medical conditions, certain kinds of patient

14

conditions — in other words, self-care in dressing,

15

needs help, needs total help — and certain other kinds

16

of conditions such as needs restraints, requires — is

Now, those two forms used in combination —

20

21

respect to these medical decision — create what are

22

called predictor scores.

25

appropriate for an SNF or skilled nursing facility.

If you get a score of 60, you

QUESTION:

1

2

Can a patient be transferred who

does not meet the state’s criteria?
MRS. GORDON:

3

Now, respondents say that those

4

forms determine the choice.

In other words, the fact

5

that the doctor has to use this form means that the

6

state has made up his mind for him.

7

is absolutely no.

8

control the use of these forms; namely, 10 New York Code

9

Rules and Regulations, Section 415.1A(2) and Section

The answer to that

The specific regulations which

10

420.1B, state in terms that all the physician who gets

11

this form has to do to say that his patient needs

12

another kind of care that is not consistent with the

13

predictor score, is say so.
In other words, the physician has an override;

14
15

the form does not foreclose the patient's access to the

16

kind of care that the doctor wants to see him have.

17

it does not determine what the doctor is supposed to do.

18

One other fact —

19

QUESTION;

Mrs. Gordon, we have granted

20

certiorari on just two questions here, relatively

21

narrow, and about half of your time is gone.
MRS. GORDON:

22

And

Very well. Your Honor.

I would

23

QUESTION;

24
25

If you would focus on those two

questions.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MRS. GORDON;

1

I would just like to point out

2

one other factor with respect to the DMS-1 forms because

3

in the entire array of federal and state laws which the

4

respondents bring to bear on their argument — which is

5

not the court of appeals* argument -- that state action

6

is somehow found in these transfers because the state

7

forces them, the only point that needs clarification is,

8

in fact, the use of these DHS-1 forms.

9

Justice O'Connor, if I just might finish, the

10

respondents also say that somehow, even if we use these

11

forms and they are not specifically controlled by the

12

state, their results are not specifically controlled by

13

the state, that we at some point review them, and we

14

determine whether they are correctly drawn or

15

incorrectly drawn, and disapprove or approve the

16

physician choices that appear on those forms.
That is an absolutely incorrect statement.

17
18

The portion of the record that the respondents cite for

19

that point is an affidavit by Donald Davidoff, which is

20

document 18 of the record on appeal, and the affidavit

21

simply does not say that, and that is not in fact what

22

we do.

23

We leave the forms as we find them.

We do

24

collect them, we use them for statistical purposes, and

25

it is possible that in the course of receiving those

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

forms or in the coarse of another procedure that the

2

respondents called to your attention which are called

3

periodic medical reviews and independent professional

4

reviews which are audits essentially of the quality of

5

care offered in nursing homes, it is possible that in

6

the course of any of this regulatory complex that the

7

state might, indeed, find a nursing home patient who is

8

inappropriately placed.
That did not happen in this case, certainly

9
10

not on these facts.

patient and it were to direct that patient’s removal

from a nursing home, well then, certainly, we would not

13

be here today arguing this case.

14

initiated transfer, and New York at least would not come

15

before this Court and claim that state action was not

16

present.

17

But if the state were to find that

That would be a state

But the kinds of transfers that were decided

18

below are all medically initiated for reasons determined

19

by private parties, and have nothing whatsoever to do

20

with the state’s control, intervention or forcing of any

21

of the decisions at issue.

22

Heturning just briefly to the standing point,

23

Your Honor, respondents make essentially two arguments

24

against the petition — the petitioner’s claim that they

25

lack standing.

The first is — depends on their

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

acknowledge that indeed, in January of 1978, the

2

district court did enjoin the URC transfers to lower

3

levels of care.
But they turn around and they say that

4
5

notwithstanding that injunction, the same individuals --

6

presumably the respondents and the intervenors — were

7

subject to the same kind of risk, albeit the injunction

8

was enforced, because the nursing home was going to

9

adopt that URC decision as its own.

It was going to

10

simply say oh, well, URC, you are enjoined; now we are

11

going to enforce that — we are going to make the same

12

choice and disregard the order.
Well, the argument omits to point out that in

13
14

the very order that enjoined the URC's — to witi

15

January 5,

16

themselves were also enjoined.

17

argument assumes that the nursing homes would have

18

entered into some kind of subterfuge or circumvention of

19

the order to make the same choice and say it was their

20

own and not a URC order.

21

the

1978 injunction — the nursing homes
And therefore, the

The record is completely barren of any

22

evidence which even suggests that the nursing home

23

sought to circumvent the order in this regard, and

24

indeed, it is barren of any evidence that the nursing

25

home ever threatened or transferred any of the named

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

respondents in any way whatsoever once the order was

2

issued.

3

Moreover, even if you accept the logic of the

4

argument, it still fails because the injunction upon

5

which it relies* namely, URC transfers to lower levels

6

of care, is not at all coextensive with the claims that

7

the respondents sought to put before the court* namely,

8

— and physician transfers to lower levels of care.

10

A second argument that respondents make with

11

respect to our claim that they lack standing relies on

12

the speculation that there must be some other member of

13

this class, even if it is not the named respondents and

14

intervenors, who in fact had a physician transfer to a

15

higher level of care, or a URC transfer to a higher

16

level of care.

17

I suggest to the Court that that argument is

18

impossible because the laws established that the claims

19

of class members can never be broader than the claims of

20

class representatives, and the only class

21

representatives before the court below were indeed the

22

named respondents and the intervenors who only had the

23

URC transfers to lower levels of care.

24
25

Respondents also called to your attention two
letters — actually, three letters* two are identical

when they so advised us — and their exchange of letters

on this point is referred to in our brief at page 6 in

if you will, to providing hearings in that context as

3

what makes those regulations inapplicable here and, in

regulations require fair hearings for agency action

essentially.

11

And the reason that it

The

And they are much like the fair hearing
regulations in Goldberg vs. Kelly or available in other
assistance programs.
The decision to transfer a patient, at least

12

in the context of this case, is not an agency decision,

13

and so much is revealed by the exhibit letter from the

14

federal government which is attached to our brief,

15

wherein the letter acknowledges that if a physician made

16

this choice, not the URC, then there would be no fair

hearing requirement obligations.

18

In other words —

19

QUESTION:

Let me just get this one question

20

out and than I will — why, if there is a URC decision

21

to increase the level of care which would require moving

22

a patient from one place to another and which might give

23

rise to this phenomenon of transfer trauma, why wouldn't

the regulation apply to that?

As the federal government used

the regulations, a transfer to a higher level of care

normally results in an increase in assistance, all

in that sense, it is inapposite, although there are some

exceptions in New York because we have a varying rate

13

under the decision in this case, the court of appeals

agency, and therefore, it could not make a relevant

decision.

17

No matter how one characterizes it,

But perhaps more importantly, if we want to

put aside all the technical deficiencies in the terms of

19

the regulations, I think we come back to what I

indicated to Justice O’Connor before, and that is that

the fair hearing does not address the issues.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHNE. KIRKLIN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

8

MR. KIRKLIN*

9
10

Mr. Kirklin?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
The respondents contend that the record in

11

12

this case clearly discloses the existence of a

13

justiciable controversy between the parties.

14

justiciability inquiry focuses properly on three main

15

areas of concern*

16

plaintiffs at the time of the consent judgment, the

17

joint pretrial order in this case, and the standing

18

allegations of the organizational plaintiff, the Grey

19

Panthers.

20

The

the circumstances of the named

With the entry of the consent judgment, which

21

ended the implementation of adverse utilization review

22

committee determinations, the named plaintiffs and class

23

members came under the immediate threat of being

24

transferred out of their facilities by the facilities

25

themselves.

It is the unequivocal command of applicable

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

state law that a nursing facility must promptly

2

transfer, without a hearing, any Medicaid patient who is

3

thought not to need that level of care.

4

Thus, Section 505.20 of the state department

5

of social services regulations state simply and clearly

6

that patients who no longer need skilled nursing or

7

health-related facility care shall be discharged

8

promptly.

9

QUESTION;

What are the sanctions which the

10

state attaches to a violation of what you describe as

11

its command?
MR. KIRKLIN*

12

Your Honor, the penalties that

13

can ensue if a facility fails to promptly discharge a

14

Medicaid patient are retroactive denial of reimbursement

15

for services rendered, fines and suspension from the

16

Medicaid program itself.
QUESTION;

17

But it is not a question of a

18

public health type of regulation where they would shut

19

down the facility if they failed to comply, I take it.

20

It is more like a regulation governing a contractor with

21

the state.
MR. KIRKLIN;

22

I imagine that might be the

23

case.

What is significant is that the state commands

24

the result; it backs it up with certain kinds of

25

sanctions.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

But I take it the nursing home is

2

perfectly free to say we will go without the money and

3

operate as we choose.
MR. KIRKLIN:

4

Well, Your Honor, we assume that

5

nursing homes, like everybody else, will comply with the

6

QUESTION:

7

So supposing that the state of New

8

York is contracted for the production of 20,000

9

envelopes or something like that with a contract, and it

10

has certain sanctions attaching to the contractor's

11

failing to comply with certain production regulations.

12

Now, if the contractor does not comply, he will not get

13

paid by the state of New York, but you would not say

14

that the contractor is commanded to comply with those

15

regulations.

16

MR. KIRKLIN:

17

situations, it might be helpful.

18

for example, were providing services to a Medicaid

19

patient and the state, as in your hypothetical, declined

20

retroactively to pay the physician, it is true that the

21

physician might, in the future, decline to provide

22

services.

23

happens here.

24
25

Let me distinguish two

The state here does not just say that if you
do not do something, we — it does not simply say we are

reotractively possibly going to deny compensation for

2

services rendered.

3

specifically says to the facility if that patient does

4

not need that level of care, you shall promptly

5

discharge that patient without a hearing.

6

it obviously certain sanctions like any affirmative

7

command of the state, but it is the nature of that

8

command which does not just impose an indirect harm on

9

the patient, but it interferes directly with that

10

It has behind

patient's right to be in that facility.
The conduct of the government directly

11

12

It directly requires — it

commands that the facility must move the patient.

13

QUESTION;

And the sanction is not that the

14

facility becomes unlicensed or goes to jail, but simply

15

that money is cut off which it otherwise would have

16

received.

17

MR. KIRKLIN:

More than that. Your Honor.

The

18

facility stands not just to lose compensation for

19

services rendered; it stands to be fined, it stands to

20

lose its right to participate in the Medicaid program.

21

And that is pretty serious in the state of New York

22

because more than 90% of the patients in nursing

23

facilities in New York state are Medicaid patients.

24

Literally, the facility depends for its very survival on

25

being part of the Medicaid program.

sanctions.

Do those sanctions apply, counsel,

to a failure to move the patient up to a higher, more

expensive level of care?

12

MR. KIRKLINs

That is right, Your Honor.

must promptly transfer a patient whose care is

18

inadequate? that is, who should be moved to a higher

level of care.

The regulations of the state

20

Further, those same regulations require that a

21

patient must be promptly moved, again without a hearing,

if the patient is otherwise inappropriately placed

other problem that jeopardizes the welfare of that

patient or of other patients in the facility.

the fact that the decision to transfer is not the

MR. KIRKLIN*

In some sense, it is the

state's, Your Honor, for this reason.

6

that I cited of the state department of social services

7

also states that the facility's judgment about whether a

Now, when you are talking about a higher level

is going to cost the state a lot more money, and they

are not eager to send some patient to a higher level of

moving patients was closed, then these plaintiffs came

14

under the threat of the state law that I described, that

15

facilities must promptly move them.

16

the facilities could rely upon the utilization review

17

process as a way of moving in appropriately placed

18

patients.

Before that time,

19

Now, both parties in the lower court

20

understood full well that the threat that the facilities

21

themselves would move these patients crystallized with

22 ’the entry of the consent judgment.

With the entry of

23

the consent judgment, which the state resisted up to the

24

last minute, the utilization review route was suddenly

25

closed shut as a way to move these plaintiffs.

of these plaintiffs, though, had been assessed against

2

the state’s DMS-1 instrument and had been found by that

evalutaion which the plaintiffs challenged, not to need

that level of care.
Now, with a consent judgment entered, the only

way that the facilities could comply with the

7

requirement of state law that they must promptly without

8

a hearing move inappropriately-placed patients was to

move them themselves.

10
11

The utilization review route was

closed.
The plaintiffs moved quickly when that threat

12

existed to have the issue adjudicated simply because any

13

delay in the resolution of that question obviously

14

carried with it the serious risk that these transfers

15

would be accomplished —

MR. KIRKLIN;

We do not retreat from the court

simpler method of disposing of the state action question

which is that

MR. KIRKLINs

4
5

The state enforces a decision.
Requires it, orders it, that is

right.
QUESTION;

So wouldn’t you say the same thing

6

then if there was a general state law about trespass or

7

something, and the home decides to move a patient and

8

the patient refuses to go, so the court — so the home

9

goes to court and gets an order, just for

10

self-protection gets an order to move the person out.

11

That is state enforcement of the private decision.

12

Would you say that is automatically state action?

13

MR. KIRKLIN;

Well, no.

I would say that when

14

the state provides a forum for deciding whether there is

15

state — there is a violation, that the mere provision

16

of a judicial forum by itself —

17

QUESTION;

Well, but the trespass action would

18

not give any hearing on the validity of the private

19

decision; it would just say are you here without consent.

20

MR. KIRKLIN;

Well, the question, Your Honor,

21

in this context is that again, if the federal and state

22

regulations themselves say that a facility cannot move a

23

person unless for valid medical reasons —

24
25

QUESTION;

Well, the general law says a person

cannot stay on somebody else’s property without

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

consent.

And a court will enforce it.
MR. KIRKLIN;

2

Here it is a question of — Your

3

Honor, we think that, for example, in the Moose Lodge

4

case where this Court had not trouble saying that if the

5

state liquor control board has a regulation that says we

6

are going to enforce a bylaw of a private club, even

7

though it is neutral in its terms, that is state

8

action.

9

He submit that this is no different where the

10

enforce or direct a nursing home to kick out a patient

11

if the patient is not thought to be appropriately there,

12

we think that is a state action as well.
QUESTION;

13

Or to raise the standards, you said

14

before.

If you enhance the care, given them higher

15

care, more benefits, you also have to have a due process

16

hearing .
MR. KIRKLIN;

17

We maintain that we do, that it

18

is required because there are due process protected

19

interests there as well because the reg is again saying

20

even if —

21

QUESTION;

On that theory you would be saying

22

that under Goldberg against Kelly, if some welfare

23

director wants to increase the welfare payments to a

24

recipient they would have to have a hearing, a Goldberg

25

v. Kelly hearing.

MR. KIRKLIN*

1

So, we would not because there

2

is no property interest under law that protects someone

3

against getting more benefits.

4

you cannot transfer a patient up or down or out unless

5

for good cause.

7

10

What is the property interest if

the transfer is to a higher level of care?
MR. KIRKLIN*

8
9

And that is the difference.

6

Here the regulations say

Your Honor, the federal and

state regulations state that a nursing facility may not

QUESTION*

11

Well, I am asking you what the

12

property interest is.

Do you have a property interest

13

if somebody wants to give you more money?

14

interest, to decline it?
MR. KIRKLIN*

15

A property

The property interest is the

16

interest which is embedded in positive state and federal

17

law that says that you should be free of having to move

18

to a higher level of care unless there is good reason to

19

do it.

20

surprising because as indicated in a deposition in this

21

case, when people are asked to go to a higher level of

22

care, they think they are dying.

And the reason why that is done is not

a medical opinion to that effect?
MR. KIRKLIN*

Not to that precise effect.

3

What is in the record. Your Honor, is the whole

4

underpinning of the consent judgment — and it is in the

5

record that the defendants made it very clear, affidavit

6

statements and the commissioner's letters to the federal

7

government, that the reason why it refused to enforce

8

review committee determinations was because the move

9

itself is so devastating and so harmful to patients that

10
11
12
13

it should not be done.
QUESTION*

Do you think there is no trauma

involved in an adversary hearing?
MR. KIRKLIN*

There is, of course, trauma

14

involved, but we do not maintain that a finding of

15

transfer trauma is necessary for the — on the narrow

16

issues that, as Your Honor pointed out, are before the

17

Court, which is whether there is state action, and on

18

the standing issue as well, that this Court did not take

19

the questions of whether there are protected property or

liberty interests involved.

are critical.

MR. KIRKLIN:

The evidence that we have here

as part of the joint pretrial order is that during the

disagreed with, they did not controver that.
And we submit that it is significant here when

the class was defined without objection, without appeal

by the defendants to include all Medicaid patients in

nursing facilities in New York state, and given this

allegation that class members were transferred

8

improperly, not controverted by the defendants, standing

9

was never interposed as a basis for objection below,

10

that that class certification can bridge the gap between

11

the allegations of the named plaintiffs and the

12

allegations, unrefuted, unobjected to by the defendants

concerning class members, when there was no objection

taken to the certification of the class, no appeal taken
