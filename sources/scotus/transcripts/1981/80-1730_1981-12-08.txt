PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments next

3 in Lugar against Edmondson Oil Company, #80-1730.

Mr.

4 Morrison, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.
5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. MORRISON, JR.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. MORRISON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court;
9

The case before the Court today is another

10 challenge of the pre-judgment seizure, somewhat on the order
11 of the Fuentes case and its various progency.

It bears a

12 rather unusual past history which I would like to go into
13 just a little bit because it bears on where we are today.
14

Mr. Lugar, the petitioner, was the lessee/operator

15 of Lakewood Truck Stop in Pittsylvania County, Virginia,
16 down near the North Carolina border.
17 proprietor.

He was its sole

Mr. Barbour is the President of Edmondson Oil

18 Company who sold fuel to Mr. Lugar for resale, and Mr. Lugar
19 had an open account with him.

That was the only

20 relationship between Edmondson Oil Company and Mr. Lugar.
21

On the 31st of May, 1977, Mr. Barbour as President

22 of Edmondson Oil Company swore out a pre-judgment attachment
23 petition in the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County, which
24 is the trial court of general jurisdiction in Virginia.
25

The petition in question alleged that Mr. Lugar

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 was, I believe, assigning, concealing, disposing or
2 converting his assets with the intent to hinder or delay his
3 creditors.
4

No fraud was alleged in the petition.
This, as I said, was sworn out on the 31st of

5 March, 1977.

On the 1st of April, 1977, it was filed in the

6 clerk's office of the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County.
7 The clerk, upon receipt of the petition for pre-judgment
8 attachment, as mandated by the Code of Virginia, issued a
9 writ of attachment to the Sheriff of Pittsylvania County
10 directing him to levy on Mr. Lugar's goods.
11

The sheriff did levy, as is shown in the Appendix,

12 in his return on the 1st, the 2nd and the 4th of April on
13 Mr. Lugar at Lakewood Truck Stop and also on his bank
14 accounts.

At that point, his business assets were frozen,

15 his bank accounts were frozen and he was prevented from
16 doing business.
17

In Virginia, the pre-judgment attachment petition

18 process is materially different from the detinue process.
19

We have both.

For a pre-judgment attachment petition you

20 need only appear before the clerk with a sworn petition
21 alleging that the defendant debtor is concealing, disposing,
22 assigning or converting his assets with intent to hinder,
23 delay or defraud his creditors.

Now, there are other

24 grounds but they are not applicable here; they deal with
25 out-of-state defendants.

1

QUESTION ;

But you filed a suit either

2 simultaneously or suit had been filed either simultaneously
3 or before that, hadn't it?
4

MR. MORRISON;

The petition for an attachment is

5 the filing of the suit.
6

QUESTION;

They are combined in one document?

7

MR. MORRISON;

Yes, sir.

If the attachment

8 petition is dismissed -- if the levy is dismissed, I should
9 say, the action proceeds as a motion for judgment, which is
10 the same thing as a complaint in Virginia by federal
11 procedure.

So even though in this case the levy was

12 dismissed, it went on as a motion for judgment and ended in
13 a judgment against Mr. Lugar.
14

The writ issues by the clerk under the law as a

15 ministerial act on the filing of the petition.

He issues a

16 writ to the sheriff, no bond is reguired for the levy,
17 although a bond for an actual physical seizure would be
18 required.

The sheriff goes and levies and really shuts them

19 down, because the bank was not about to allow him the use of
20 the money with a levy attached to it.
21

QUESTION;

Do you say this is just like Fuents

22 against Shevin, then?
23

MR. MORRISON;

I would say it's very similar to

24 Fuentes v. Shevin, Your Honor.

The difference that I would

25 make between this and Fuents v. Shevin is that in Fuentes v.
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Shevin you had various items of personal property such as, I
2 believe, a stove, seized.

In this case we had everything

3 seized, or everything levied upon.
4

QUESTION;

So you think it's an even stronger case

5 than Fuentes.
6

HR. MORRISON;

Yes, sir, I do.

I think that this

7 is also very easily comparable to the North Georgia
8 Finishing case.
9

Then, when the sheriff levies, th e defendant may

10 then come in and file an affidavit of substantial defense.
11 When he files that, the creditor has ten days in which to
12 post a bond to protect his levy.
13 if the bond is not filed.

The levy will be dismissed

And in this case, a bond was

14 filed after the affidavit of substantial defense was filied
15 by Mr. Lugar.
16

The statute provides that when the petition is

17 issued, there will be a return date on it, and in this case,
18 the date of the hearing was set for one day after the return
19 date; the return date was the 18th of April, the hearing
20 date was set for the 19th, and a hearing was held on that
21 date.
22
23 received.

No decision with respect to the levy was
A second hearing was held, I believe, on the 1st

24 or the 4th of May, I am not sure which.

And on the 4th of

25 May, 1977, a the Circuit Court of Pittsylvania County
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 finally dissolved the levy finding that no grounds
2 whatsoever had been proven which would support the
3 attachment.
4

Then, after the state proceedings were concluded,

5 Mr. Lugar filed a complaint in federal court seeking damages
6 for deprivation of rights guaranteed under the Constitution
7 under 42 U.S. Code Section 1983.

The creditor filed a

8 motion to abstain, alleging that a decision of the Virginia
9 Supreme Court might eliminate the need for a decision on
10 federal grounds.

That was the only thing that was contained

11 in that motion.
12

We briefed the issue of abstention.

The district

13 court turned around and ignored the abstention issue and
14 dismissed on the authority of Flagg Brothers, describing the
15 conduct in Flagg Brothers as more flagrant than the conduct
16 in this case.
17

Lugar sought to amend the judgment or to have it

18 modified, was unsuccessful in doing so on appeal.

In the

19 Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the parties addressed the
20 issue of whether or not the reliance on Flagg Brothers was
21 appropriate.
22

The court of appeals decided that the district

23 court's reliance on Flagg Brothers was not appropriate, but
24 affirmed dismissal on a different ground that was, again,
25 not addressed by the parties, there being a requirement in
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 suits of this sort for a — either an allegation or a
2 finding of a direct conspiracy, a corruption, if you will,
3 of state power between the private party and the state
4 officials, or, in the alternative as I understand their
5 opinion, such an abdication of control over state power is
6 to make the state merely agents or the state just gives the
7 power to the creditor.
8

QUESTION:

9 point, doesn’t it?

Well, this goes to a fairly fundamental
Is there a difference between the

10 Fourteenth Amendment’s prohibition which is addressed only
11 to states, and the language under color of state law in
12 1983?
13

Do those mean the same thing?
MR. MORRISON:

I believe they do. Your Honor.

But

14 I believe that this Court has put a gloss on the meaning of
15 under color of state law to include actions by private
16 parties which are joint and with the state.

And in this

17 situation here, the state acts as an agent of the private
18 party.
19

The point that I have made in the court of appeals

20 and that I tried to make to the district court was that in
21 the situation that we have here where there is no
22 pre-attachment property interest whatsoever in the property
23 that is going to be seized, that the creditor has no
24 self-help remedy whatsoever.

If he was to act for a

25 self-help remedy, he would be liable for criminal penalties
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and we wouldn’t be here today if that's what had happened.
2

But instead, what happens is the state, so to

3 speak, on a silver platter says here, you may use us to take
4 sides in your dispute with your defendant debtor initially;
5 we're going to seize his property for you.
6

QUESTION*

Would you take the same position if it

7 were a garnishment?
8

HR. MORRISON*

If it was a pre-judgment

9 garnishment, yes, sir.
10

QUESTION*

Host garnishments are pre-judgment, are

11 they not?
12

MR. MORRISON*

13 lour Honor.

I have not seen any in my practice,

I have filed a good many post-judgment

14 garnishments against debtors when I was conducting
15 collection cases, but I have not, that I can recollect, seen
16 a pre-judgment garnishment in Virginia, although it is
17 allowed by this statute.
18

QUESTION*

Mr. Morrison, the court of appeals said

19 that it was not clear to it whether you were alleging or
20 asserting that the Virginia statute is unconsitutional.
21 What is your position?

Are you attacking the

22 constitutionality of the Virginia statute?
23

MR. MORRISON*

At this point I am, Your Honor, and

24 the reason for their statement is -- I have been trying —
25

QUESTION*

It wasn't briefed, so it was hard to
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 know if that was your position.
2

MR. MORRISON;

No, it wasn't briefed and we never

3 even addressed the issue because we were addressing the
4 question of whether or not Flagg Brothers applied.
5

QUESTION;

Mr. Morrison, I thought the issue of

6 constitutionality of the Virginia procedure was not here.
7

MR. MORRISON;

Your Honor, I think the Fourth

8 Circuit Court of Appeals has brought it here.

They have

9 said that the arguments made by Lugar -- and the district
10 court has said the same thing -- amount to an attack on the
11 statute and that that is what they are deciding; whether or
12 not the statute is constitutional.
13

QUESTION;

I thought the court of appeals said it

14 was not deciding that because it was unclear what your
15 positio n wa s.
16

MR . M0RR ISON ;

It

17 because under the circ um sta
18 it.

It found that there wa

20 opinion and I don ' t know th
21 Lugar h ad said tha t he w as
22 that is what h e wa s doin g.
23

But what

I was at

24 articul ate it very well, wa
25 and the court of a ppeals th
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 constitutionality of a statute because the state and the
2 creditor acted without conforming to the state statute.

In

3 other words, there is no need for this Court or any other
4 court to decide the constitutionality of the statute if the
5 creditor and the state break their own law, just as in
6 Monroe v . Fate .
7

QUESTION*

That wouldn't be a 1983 suit anyway,

8 then.
9

MR. MORRISON*

Yes, Your Honor, I believe it

10 would, because in Monroe v. Pate and in Adickes v. Kress and
11 the others, if the state is acting even in violation of its
12 law, it is still action under color of state law.
13

QUESTION*

Well, it may be under color of state

14 law, but what's the constitutional violation?
15

MR. MORRISON:

The denial of due process, Your

16 Honor, under color of state law.

The power and authority of

17 the state under the alleged attachment statute, the
18 attachment statute we are dealing with, are what brought the
19 levy on the Mr. Lugar’s assets.

The state acted.

The state

20 acted at the sole behest of the creditor, but it acted
21 without the fraud that the statute requires being present or
22 even alleged.
23

QUESTION:

You say -- didn't you have some

24 appellate remedy in Virginia if the state broke -- or the
25 private party broke his Virginia’s law?
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. MORRISON:

Well, Your Honor, I don’t think the

2 private party broke Virginia’s laws in the sense of a -- for
3 instance, a criminal violation.

What happened was the

4 private party filed a petition for attachment which didn’t
5 meet the full requirements of the Virginia law, and the
6 clerk looked at it and issued a
7
8 later,
9

QUESTION:

writ anyway.

And it was set aside as improvident

wasn't it?
MR. MORRISON:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. MORRISON:

Yes, Your Honor, it was.

In the Virginia court.
In the Virginia court, it

was

12 dismissed as being improvidently -13

QUESTION:

Do you feel the constitutional issue is

14 covered in your questions presented?
15

MR. MORRISON:

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

16

QUESTION:

Where? I didn't see it.

17

QUESTION:

I just read them over and Ishare

18 Justice Marshall's reaction.
19

QUESTION:

It said federal law, and I guess that

20 includes the Constitution, also the Declaration of
21 Independence.
22

MR. MORRISON:

Yes, sir, I stand corrected.

The

23 initial question is whether there was joint participation or
24 engagement by private litigants with state officials, which
25 is what the court of appeals decided, but it --

1

2

QUESTION:

Yes, but that's not a constitutional

issue.

3

NR. MORRISON:

4

QUESTION:

No, sir, it's not.

How far would you carry this concept of

5

state action?

6

erroneously in some way.

7

action in the sense that you're arguing it here today?
MR. MORRISON:

8
9

Suppose a divorce decree is entered
Is that decree of the court state

Yes, sir, it is under Shelly v.

Kramer, but I am not quite sure how the erroneous divorce

10

decree is going to affect the person that it's entered

11

against.
QUESTION:

12

It might affect a person in the sense

13

that it might expose one or both of the parties to a

14

criminal charge of bigamy if, in fact, the divorce was not a

15

divorce, a valid divorce.
MR. MORRISON:

16

I believe theoretically it might,

17

but I know that Virginia has procedures for dealing with

18

tha t.
QUESTION;

19

Mr. Morrison, my comments about the

20

constitutional issue, don't regard them as undercutting your

21

case.

22

were other than the constitutional ones.

23

I think your case is here, but I thought the issues

MR. MORRISON;

I agree with Your Honor.

The issue

24

is whether or not the court of appeals should be reversed

25

and this case should be sent back to the district court for
13

1 finding of facts.
2

We are here on a very, very skimpy record

Shat is being attacked in the district court is

3 the action of the creditor with the state under color of
4 state law.
5

QUESTION;

Does that mean, Mr. Morrison, if you

6 prevail and there's a reversal on the ground that indeed,
7 this was action under color of state law, then your
8 allegations of unconstitutionality are still to be
9 determined in the district court or the trial?

MR. MORRISON*

2

QUESTION*

3

MR. MORRISON;

4

QUESTION*

Yes, sir, we'll have to get --

But we don’t have to determine it here.
No, sir.

That’s why I don’t want to complicate

5 your case with determining it in any way.
6

MR. MORRISON*

No, sir, and I don’t want to

7 determine it here because we don’t have the sufficient facts,
8

QUESTION*

But, Mr. Morrison, we do have

9 sufficient facts if I understand the problem correctly.

The

10 court of appeals said the "under of color of state law" or
11 state action issue, however you describe it, is quite
12 different if you are alleging a failure to follow the
13 Virginia statute which resulted in the deprivation of due
14 process on the one hand, or are you alleging that the
15 Virginis statute, if followed to its letter, would be
16 unconstitutional.

And the court of appeals said you are

17 makign the latter kind of contention.
18

It’s on that assumption that the color of state

19 law issue must be addressed.

And they assume that if you

20 merely allege deprivation of due process because you didn’t
21 follow the Virginia law, clearly you have no 1983 case.
22

MR. MORRISON*

23

QUESTION*

Well, Your Honor, —

I don’t know if I made that clear or

24 not, but they were quite clear, it seemed to me, in saying
25 that they, despite your ambiguity in the trial court, they
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

read your complaint as an attack on the constitutionality of

2 the Virginia statute.
3

MR. MORRISON:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes, sir.

But they didn't decide it because they

said even as so read, there's no state action or color of

6 state law.

QUESTION:

7

8 in
9
10

Hell, as the court of appeals asked me

argument, do you think the statute is unconstitutional,

and I said yes, and I do thin

the statute is

unconstitutional .
QUESTION:

11

And if you don't so contend, they also

12

indicated you wouldn't have any basis for a 1983 claim.

We

13

don't have to decide the constitutionality of the statute;

14

but I think we must decide the state action issue on the

15

assumption that you seek to challenge the Virginia statute.

16

MR. MORRISON;

Yes, sir, I understand your point.

17

The complaint as filed does allege a denial of due

18

process, and it alleges that the parties acted under the

19

color of state law, acted jointly.

There is a specific

20 paragraph in the complaint alleging that Mr.
21

Edmondson Oil Company were joint participants with the state

22 and
23
24
25

Barbour and

that they acted under color of state law.
QUESTION:

But that question is not here; at least

it is not in the questions presented, is it?
MR. MORRISON:

The question presented is whether
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 on the facts alleged, there was no joint participation or
2 engagement by private litigants with state officials,
3 amounting to action under color of state law.
4

QUESTION;

But it says nothing about the due

5 process.
6

MR. MORRISON;

No, sir,

we never reached the due

7 process.
8

What is -- at least, I don’t believe we reached

9 the question of due process there.
10

Wh
What we are arguing here is that the case should

11 be returned
>d for a decision on the factual and legal
12 positions ta
taken by the parties.

We are here in part because

13 the lower courts
CO
have changed the grounds of the decision
14 from what th
the parties were arguing each time they made a
15 decision
decision,, so that the questions I'm arguing now never were
16 really addre
addressed in the court of appeals, as I understood
17 it,

becau se
;e we were addressing the question of the

18 applicabi li
_ity
t
of Flagg Brothers.
19

Bu
But the question of color of state law —

20

QUESTION;
QU

Well, how does it get here?

If you say

21 the court of appeals didn’t consider it at all, how does it
22 get here?
23

MR
MR. MORRISON;

The court of appeals considered the

24 question -of
of the color of state law, but we were arguing
whe
or not the Flagg Brothers decision, which
25 about is whether
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 said that a

private warehouseman's lien does not amount to

was dispositive of this

3 case.

QUESTIONj

4

Then isn't your real complaint that the

5 court of appeals so far departed from normal usage;
6 arguied

you

a claim to it that you had raised in the district

7 court and it refused to pass on

HR. MORRISON;

8

9 that it did not find

it?

Well, it passed on it.

It said

Flagg Brothers to be dispositive.

That

10

was in the first page or two of its opinion.

11

specifically made that statement, and then it said that it

12 was going to affirm
13

QUESTION;

14 claim is.

It

on other grounds.
Counsel, I'm still uncertain what your

Do you now concede that you are not here on a

15 claim that the creditor and

Is that on the theory that the creditor

MR. MORRISON;

5

QUESTION;

6
7

No, Your Honor.

Or improperly applied the facts to

Virginia's law?
MR. MORRISON;

No, You r Honor.

The claim is that

8

the action as taken, even if it were just line by line in

9

accordance with Virginia law -- whether or not they did it

10

right, the claim is that it was in violation of Lugar's

11

constitutional rights.

12

we would still claim --

13

QUESTION;

I don't care if they alleged fraud*

It's just that I'm still confused as to

14

whether you're relying on constitutionality of the statute

15

or on some erroneous allegation of facts by the creditor.

16

MR. MORRISON;

He are relying on the involvement

17

of the state of Virginia in a process which we believe is,

18

on the face of it, unconstitutional.

QUESTION;

Why didn't your raise that in your

questions presented?

MR. MORRISON;

3

QUESTION;

Yes, sir, that’s what they said.

And you're saying they were absolutely

4 wrong in saying there was no color of state law in this case
5

MR. MORRISON;

6

QUESTION;

7 anyway.

Yes, sir.

That's one of the things you're arguing

And you want whatever the court of appeals decided

8 reversed, and what they decided was that there was no color
9 of state law.
10

MR. MORRISON;

11

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

That's what you answered me earlier.

12 If you prevail as to that, and what you want is a trial on
13 your allegations that the Virginia statute is
14 unconstitutional.

MR. MORRISON;

QUESTION;

Because I notice it's not in your brief

24

MR. MORRISON;

No, sir.

The Chief Justice asked

25 me about an erroneous divorce decree as being an action
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 under color of state law, and I said that I would assume
2 that it would be based on the Shelly v. Kramer case, that a
3 judicial act is an act under color of state law,
4

We submit to the Court that in this situation

5 there is action under color of state law.

The state is

6 fully involved up to its neck, figuratively speaking, with
7 the private party.

As I said, to do for the private party

8 what the private party cannot do for itself, by any means,
9 without the private party even having the basic requirement
10 that was found to be important in the Mitchell case of a
11 prior property interest which must be protected and
12 prevented from being depreciated.
13

In this situation , the creditor simply started the

14 lawsuit with a petition for pre-judgment attachment, which
15 the court of appeals characterized as submission to the
16 neutral arbiter, and then the neutral arbiter turned around
17 and took sides immediately and seized the property.

And

18 when it seized the property, it shut the man down so that
19 you have the same sort of effect as you do with a
20 pre-judgment garnishment of wages in both Lynch and Sniadach.
21

And we submit to the Court that under the

22 circumstances, where the state is going to involve itself to
23 that extent, that in fact, there is action under color of
24 state law, sufficient at least for an evidentiary hearing.
25 And as a result, we would ask that the Court reverse the
21

1 court of appeals and send it back for trial.

I'd like to reserve any time I have left for

3 rebuttal, if the Court has no more questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES W. HASKINS, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8

MR. HASKINS;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9 the Court;
10

One thing that the respondents specifically

11 disagree with as stated by the petitioner -- and this was
12 subject to comment by the district court in his opinion and,
13 of course, as this Court has already pointed out, subject of
14 some comment by the court of appeals.

When the initial

15 complaint under Section 1983 was filed in the district
16 court, the respondents filed a motion to abstain on the
17 theory that the complaint had to be, in effect, to be a 1983
18 action it had to be some sort of challenge to the
19 constitutionality of the Virginia attachment statutes.
20

The respondents, in filing the motion to abstain,

21 requested the district court to abstain so that this issue
22 could be properly determined by the Supreme Court of
23 Virginia.
24

Now, in arguing the motion to abstain from the

25 outset of this case, the petitioner has affirmatively
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 disavowed any challenge of a constitutional nature to the
2 Virginia attachment statutes.

On page 5 of the district

3 court record, he specifically wrote the district court in
4 memorandum -- this is cited in our brief — saying there's
5 no question of the constitutionality of the statute being in
6 issue.
7

Now, as the court of appeals pointed out, this

8 ambivalence, this lack of any sort of clear challenge to the
9 constitutionality of the statute persisted in the Fourth
10 Circuit Court of Appeals.
11

On page 53 of the Petition for Write of Ceriorari,

12 which contains the opinion of the court of appeals, it's
13 obvious that the decision of the Fourth Circuit is premised
14 in part on the presumptive, valid state judicial
15 proceedings.

The opinion of the Fourt Circuit, taking the

16 narrow issue as presented to the district court and, of
17 course, to the court of appeals, is that the attachment
18 statutes of the state of Virginia are constitutionally sound.
19

The petitioner, in answer to Justice Rehnquist's

20 question, seems to assume and has assumed throughout this
21 case, that state action and acting under color of state law
22 for purposes of a 1983 action are the same thing.

Now

23 clearly, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals says they are
24 not the same thing.
25

The Fourteenth Amendment, and, of course -23

You said that they didn't ever raise

They did raise it in their

MR. HASKINS;

Well, Justice Marshall, it is the

of the district court and the opinion of the Fourth

9 Circuit that the only constitutional challenge at that
10 point,

as in all of the cases from Fuentes v. Shevin, right

11 through Flagg Brothers,
12 whether

whether the case was a 1983 case or

it came up through an appeals process from a state

13 supreme court, there has been a direct attack on —

QUESTION;

This says on page 6 of the Appendix,

15 Giles M. Lugar has been deprived of his property by state
16 action without due process of law, as guaranteed under the
17 Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
18 Constitution.
19

MR. HASKINS;

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. HASKINS;

Yes, sir, now --

That's kind of direct, isn't it?
Justice Marshall, what the

22 petitioner --

23

QUESTION;

Well, I ask you how you would be more

24 direct.
25

MR. HASKINS;

To say that the state of Virginia,

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 sir, is responsible in some way

the Fourteenth Amendment

2 and the Fifth Amendment, and specifically the Fourteenth
3 Amendment, deal with deprivations of property by the state.
4 The Fourteenth Amendment, as I understand it -- and I would
5 stand corrected very quickly I*m sure, -- but it offers no
6 protection from deprivations of property from citizen by
7 citizen.
8

In the entire complaint, the three counts, sir,

9 the petitioner is that Edmondson Oil and Mr. Barbour, its
10 President, deprived him of these constitutional rights.
11 Nowhere in this complaint is it alleged -- in fact, the
12 petitioner, as I said, in the district court specifically
13 disavows any challenge to state action.
14

QUESTION t

15 the district court .

But, Mr. Haskins, I know he did that in
But in the court of appeals on page 45

16 of the Cert Petition, the court recognizing this problem, as
17 a footnote says, "We construe Lugar's claim to include a
18 constitutional challenge to the statute itself."

Now, we

19 must so interpret the claim, must we not?
20

HR. HASKINSs

21 with you, sir.

Justice Stevens, I'll be quite frank

I don't understand that footnote in relation

22 to the statement of the issue on page 53, some five or six
23 pages over.
24

QUESTION;

Well, this is rather unambiguous, and

25 the court of appeals did make it quite clear that if they
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 thought he was merely alleging a misapplication of the
2 Virginia statute, that there would he no 1983 claim at all.
3

MR. HASKINS*

4

QUESTION;

That's correct,

sir.

So in order to have something to write

5 this rather long opinion about, apparently the court of
6 appeals said we at least read the complaint to include a
7 challenge to the statute itself.

And therefore, the state

8 action issue is whether the Virginia legislature's statute,
9 plus the involvement of the clerk and the sheriff, is enough

t.

.on to trigger 1983.
MR. HASKINS;

That's correct, sir, I agree with

BBut certainly, the basis of the court of appeals's

13 opinion, again as they call it the dispositive issue, the
14 reason
reasoning
in
that follows certainly assumes that the petitioner

QUESTION;

Mr. Haskins, in your brief you — I

18 think yo
you do anyway — you disavow the rationale of the
19 court of appeals.
20

Do you adhere to that position here?

MR. HASKINS*

Yes, sir.

Justice Blackmun, our

positi on is -- and I think the position of the court of
21 position
CM
CM

22 appeals
a ppeal s is, following up Justice Stevens' question -- that

action and acting under color of law are not the same
23 state ac
24 thing.

If state action is all that was involved, certainly

state
at' of Virginia in this case, through the actions of
25 the st

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the clerk and through the actions of the sheriff who issued

2

the attachment and levied the attachment, certainly there

3

was state action.
Now, the question is where the state judicial

4
5

proceedings are presumptively valid, as in this case, as the

6

court of appeals stated, where there is no even insinuation

7

that the clerk and the sheriff did anything wrong, anything

8

out of the ordinary, in fact the petitioner clearly states

9

that they acted only according to law -- he states that in

10

the statement of facts to the brief on the merits in this

11

Court.

12

formulated it, is granted there's state action; but for

13

purposes of a 1983 action, is that action under color of

14

state law to sustain a complaint filed under the 1983

15

section.

16

properly so, held that it was not.

17

The question then, as the court of appeals

Rnd of course, the court of appeals, and I think

Now, Justice Blackmun, I don't agree -- or I think

18

probably the language of the court of appeals may be too

19

severe to say that in a 1983 action, the plaintiff has got

20

to show corruption of the state official in such a manner

21

that it, in effect, reduces the state's power to a joint

22

concert and joint action between the private defendant.

23

I think --

24

QUESTION;

25

Mr. Haskins, it's obvious that there is

some confusion as the case progressed through the courts,
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and perhaps further questioning is not a satisfactory way of
2 resolving it, but what do you make of the pen ultimate
3 paragraph of the footnote 1 of the court of appeals on page
4 44 where they say, "As will appear, it has not been
5 necessary in our disposition of the appeal to address the
6 question of whether the property seizure was
7 constitutionally invaid on either ground.

We therefore note

8 this confusion only to observe that had the challenge been
9 limited to a claim of unconstitutional application of the
10 statute in the course of the state attachment proceeding, we
11 would have had a clear alternative basis for affirmance of
12 the dismissal.

It is well settled that no cause of action

13 lies under Section 1983 to redress deprivations of
14 procedural due process occurring during state court
15 litigation between private parties."
16

MB. HASKINS;

Yes, sir?

What is my reaction to

17 that?
18

QUESTION;

Yes.

19

MR. HASKINS;

I think what the court of appeals is

20 saying, Justice Rehnquist, as pointed out by Justice Stevens

21 in his dissent to Flagg Brothers, that a petitioner, if what
22 he is saying is simply that the clerk or the sheriff in
23 issuing or levying the attachment, that there were just
24 certain procedural defects in the Virginia law, certainly
25 that would provide an alternative basis for dismissal of the
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 complaint.
2

To have any sort of challenge, again to paraphrase

3 Justice Stevens' dissent in the Flagg Brothers case, for a
4 jurisdictional basis of 1983, there has to be a challenge to
5 the constitutionality of the statute itself.
6

As I read all of the cases, Fuents, Sniadach,

7 North Georgia Finishing, Mitchell v. Grant, in each of these
8 cases there's been an unquestioned constitutional attack on
9 the statute itself in order to give the required state
10 action or acting under color of state law.
11

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Haskins, I gather from the

12 citations in that footnote that my brother Rehnquist
13 referred to, there's no decision of this Court that no cause
14 of action lies under 1983 to address deprivations of
15 procedural due process.

And those citations indicate that

16 the circuits are in conflict over it.

That the Fifth and

17 Second so hold, perhaps also the Tenth, but the First
18 apparently -- note the "But see Kermit" -- apparently goes
19 the other way.
20

MR. HASKINS:

Yes, sir.

21 circuits are in conflict.

But I think these

Justice Brennan, in regard to the

22 opinions of the circuit court of appeals which the
23 petitioner has cited in his brief, -- there are some five or
24 six from the various circuits throughout the country -25 again, in each of these cases as well as the cases that I've

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

this Court, each case involves a direct

2 challenge to the constitutionality of a state statute.

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. HASKINS:

5 statute itself.

Not a procedural default -Rights through the substance of the

That, in our opinion, sir, is what is

6 lacking in this case as far as giving the district court any

7 jurisdiction under 1983.
QUESTION:

8

Again, though, apparently court of

9 appeals, as Justice Stevens suggested earlier to Mr.
10

Haskins, going on with that footnote 1, "Therefore

11

constitute this complaint as a constitutional challenge to

12

the statute itself", and not merely a procedural default.

13 Did they not?
14

MR. HASKINS:

15 Justice Stevens.

Again, I will try to respond to

I think that is somewhat in conflict with

16 the statement on page 53 of the issue they framed.

They

17 definitely assumed on page 53 of the Petition for Writ of
18 Certiorari, that the statute was certainly presumptively
19 valid.
20

And the judicial proceedings were valid -QUESTION:

But really, all that means is that if

21 you get to the merits of the statute, the burden is on
22 person challenging

23 of validity.
24

the

the statute to overcome the presumption

That's all that means.

MR. HASKINS:

25 also, Justice Stevens.

Well, I think it could mean this
Of course, this case was dismissed
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 on the complaint for lack of any federal jurisdiction under
2 1983.

What they are saying, as I understand it, due to the

3 petitioner's constant disavowal that he is making any attack
4 on the Virginia statutes, we must therefore assume the
5 statute is valid.
6

QUESTION:

Well, if that's true you don't have to

7 worry about state action or anything else.

They wouldn't

8 have written this long opinion if that was their rationale.
9 I think he's saying it's presumptively a valid statute and
10 therefore, you've got to have something more than the action
11 of the clerk and the sheriff in order to say that it was a
12 deprivation by the state.

And that is that half of the

13 two-pronged inquiry.
14

MR. HASKINS:

Well, I think this.

That you can

15 assume the Virginia statute is valid, and you can assume, as
16 the court of appeals points out, that there is state action
17 involved by the Virginia court clerk and the Virginia
18 sheriff.

Now, that does not mean or does not necessarily

19 preclude that the defendants, the respondents, were not
20 acting under color of state law if some way there was some
21 sort of concerted action between as they call him the
22 private actor/respondent, Edmondson Oil and Mr. Barbour,
23 with a state official.
24

The statute can be perfectly valid, and they say

25 that we assume it's a valid statute.

We assume that there

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 is state action.
2 action.

There's no question there was state

But a 1983 action requires a third element, and

3 that element is that the private respondent act under color
4 of state law to deprive the petitioner of a federal
5 constitutional right.
6

QUESTION;

That's like analyzing the case in terms

7 of the bribery of the judge in that case.
8

MR. HASKINS;

9

QUESTION;

10 reject that theory.

In Dennis v. Sparks.

That would be one theory and they
But I really don't think it's a fair

11 reading of the complaint to say that he has alleged that
12 kind of corruption in this case.
13

It seems to me, given the gloss that the court of

14 appeals puts on it in its footnotes, it seems to me we
15 should analyze the case as though he made a clearcut attack
16 on the constitutionality of the statute.

And then ask on

17 that assumption, is there sufficient state involvement.
18

QUESTION;

And shouldn't we also ask as to whether

19 the court was proper in denying a motion to abstain?

20

MR. HASKINS:

Yes, sir.

I think under this

21 Court's decision in Carey v. Sugar, the New York case, that
22 if the constitutionality of the Virginia statute, the
23 substantive constitutionality is to be challenged, then the
24 district court should have abstained and this case should
25 have been referred back or dismissed -32

9 he should have.
10

MR. HASKINS:

No, I thought Justice Rehnquist said

11 if the constitutionality of the statute was an issue.

Of

12 course, when that issue came up, the petitioner clearly
13 wrote the district court a memorandum saying he was not
14 challenging the constitutionality, so what else could he
15 do?

In the trial if the man says this is not an issue,

23

I think clearly, the petitioner in this case is

5 malicious creditors, the respondents, not by the state of

And for that reason, I think the district court

7 and the court of appeals was correct in dismissing this

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER.-

Thank you.

Do you have anything

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. MORRISON, JR., ESQ.

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- Rebuttal

13

MR. MORRISON:

Yes, Your Honor.

To address the

14 last point made by Mr. Haskins first, I would submit to the
15 Court that the complaint clearly states what the plaintiff
16 alleges* that the creditors maliciously and jointly with the
17 state deprived him of his rights.

And that's what is

18 alleged.
19

The Flagg Brothers opinion in footnote 10

20 specifically accepts that from the effect of that opinion,
21 the pre-judgment seizure cases which this Court has decided
22 in Fuentes, Lynch, Sniadach, North Georgia Finishing and in
23 Mitchell.

QUESTION;

Mr. Morrison, you don't quarrel with

25 the proposition, do you, that if one is attacking the

2 raised at its earliest possible moment and preserved
3 throughout the case?
4

MR. MORRISON;

I think, the issue has to be raised

5 when the complaint is filed, Your Honor.
6

QUESTION;

And preserved?

7

MR. MORRISON;

Preserved as best possible.

As I

8 have said to the Court, the problem in the district court
9 and in the court of appeals rose from perhaps my
10 misapprehension of the holding in Monroe v. Pathe among
11 others that action taken because of state authority and
12 power, whether or not legal under state law, still amounts
13 to state action under color of state law because the state's
14 power and authority is what makes the act possible.
15

And that is exactly what has happened here.

The

16 state's power and authority is what has made the deprivation
17 possible; not the individual acts of the private defendants,
18 taken outside of the context of the state.

The state

19 provided — and under the decisions of this Court in

20 Fuentes, the state statute effectively abdicates its
21 control.

The state provided —

MR. MORRISON;

17

It does so as a

That's what is lacking here.

The state does not act as a neutral arbiter; the

18 state comes in and immediately takes sides and freezes one

And does it under

The creditor here acted with knowledge of the
