ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN W. PRAGER, JR., ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER IN 80-1798

10

MR. PRAGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, these consolidated cases are here on

12

petitions for certiorari to the United States Court of

13

Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

14

affirmed the Labor Board's decision that the

15

construction unions involved in this case did not

16

violate Section 8(b)(4)(A) of the Labor Act by picketing

17

to obtain certain restrictive union-only subcontracting

18

provisions which are commonly called subcontractor’s

19

clauses because both the court and the Board believed

20

that such provisions were protected by the construction

21

proviso to Section 8(e) of the Labor Act.

The en banc court below

Two questions are thus presented to the

22
23

Court.

First, are subcontractor’s clauses always valid

24

under the construction proviso simply because they are

25

contained in a lawful collective bargaining relationship

no.

Thus, in order for a subcontractor to be

eligible to compete for the contractor's work, he must

agree to sign the same exact union contract to which the

these clauses are that the union in effect has a broad

Those interests are

14

to prevent the alleviation of the job site tension on

18

where that job site friction may develop.

19

unless the union has an identifiable dispute at a

non-union workers are working side by side, there is no

Our adversaries, the Respondents in this

matter, argue that the construction industry proviso had

more than one purpose.

They argue that Congress

intended by their proviso to preserve a pattern of

collective bargaining which they say existed prior to

1959.

13

We do not believe the legislative history or

14

this Court's previous decision in Connell supports that

argument.

argument in 1975, for that argument is based solely on

QUESTION;

Mr. Prager, before you get to that.

2

can I ask you, do you dispute the suggestion by your

3

adversaries that this type of clause was prevalent in

4

the construction industry prior to 1959?

5

ME. PBAGER:

We dispute that it was a pattern

6

that this clause was in.

7

construction unions, even as far back as 1941, had such

8

provisions in some contracts throughout the United

9

States, but the number of such contracts is by far very

called the London Study, which was done in 1961, two

12

years after the statute was passed, which found that

13

some clauses did exist.

14

The board relies upon a study

The general counsel of the NLRB, in reviewing

15

that study in 1976, concluded that there was no pattern,

16

that the most that could be said was that there was a

17

mosaic of types of subcontracting restrictions.

18

Labor Board now argues, however, that that mosaic

19

somehow or other has been transformed into a pattern.

20

We disagree with that.

21

The

The Labor Board also argues that the clauses

22

must be valid in order for construction unions to

23

maintain the continuity of fringe benefits and to

24

protect the job opportunities of construction workers.

25

That may be a very laudatory goal, but it is not one

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that finds any support in the legislative history to the

2

construction proviso to Section 8(e).

If a construction union needs to protect its

restraints involved in these kinds of subcontractor

clauses.

Now, perforce, that preserves

10

It can negotiate a provision that says, as long as a

11

majority of the work force of the contractor's employees

12

are working, the employer may subcontract out work, but

13

if that subcontracting will produce another layoff so

14

that less than a majority of the bargaining unit would

15

be working, subcontracting would be prohibited.

16

The simple fact of the matter is that broad

17

top-down organizing clauses which name particular unions

18

as the beneficiaries of those clauses are not necessary

19

to preserve job opportunities.

20

preservation test that this Court has previously adopted

21

indicates that such kinds of work preservation goals are

22

primary goals, goals which are not within the scope of

23

the prohibition to Section 8(e) in any event.

Furthermore, the work

that the Court is persuaded that as long as the Board's

statute to reach your position.

19

MR. PRAGER;

You have to

That is correct, Justice

20

O'Connor, but this Court has previously done so in two

21

decisions. National Woodwork and in Connell, where the

22

Court took the position that a thing may not be within

23

the statute because not within the intent of its makers,

24

notwithstanding the literal language of the statute, and

25

relying on the Court's previous judgments along that

line, we have taken the position that the literal

2

wording of the statute should not be read.

3

QUESTION:

I suppose we left the question open

4

in the Connell decision, and we now have to resolve it.

5

Before you finish, would you address yourself briefly to

6

the second issue?

8

to address it.

There is a concern about whether that

The Board has maintained the rule

that a union can — that a union can picket to obtain

these clauses since the early sixties.

13

such provisions could not be obtained by picketing but

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS K. SCOTT, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN 80-1808 and 81-91

12

MR. SCOTT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

13

please the Court, in the Connell case, the subcontractor

14

clause prohibited the general contractor from doing

15

business with any plumbing subcontractor that did not

16

have a labor contract with Plumbers Local 100.

17

general contractor, Connell Construction Company in that

18

case, did not itself employ any plumbers at any time on

19

any of its jobs.

Now, the

This Court held in Connell that that

20
21

subcontractor clause was not within the purpose of the

22

proviso, and therefore not within the proviso.
QUESTION:

language.
MR. SCOTT:

Exactly.

Construction Company had itself employed just a couple

2

of plumbers on just one job for just a couple of months,

3

and if Plumbers Local 100 had put the very same

4

subcontractor’s clause in a full labor contract covering

5

just those two plumbers, then, according to the rule of

6

the Labor Board and of the court below, that

7

subcontractor clause would be lawful, and it would apply

8

at all times on all jobs of Connell Construction Company

9

throughout the life of the contract.
Furthermore, according to the rule of the

10
11

Labor Board and of the court below, Plumbers Local 100

12

could picket Connell Construction Company to force

13

Connell to agree to that clause, the very same clause.
Now, the effect of that same subcontractor

14
15

clause at all times on all of Connell’s jobs except for

16

just that two-month period on that one job where Connell

17

employed the two plumbers would be indistinguishable

18

from the effects of the subcontractor’s clause in

19

Connell.

20

would operate as a broad organizational weapon,

21

organizing from the top down the subcontractor’s

22

employees by use of a secondary boycott, and at all such

23

times without any redeeming virtue based on the close

24

community of interests at the particular job site

25

involved.

At all such times, the subcontractor clause

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

MR. SCOTT*

Your Honor —
In an amicus brief?
Yes, Your Honor, it was.
By General Moore?
That's right, and it is my

17

understanding it was presented and considered and

18

rejected by the Court in Connell.

19

The Labor Board and the court below seek to

20

distinguish Connell on the ground that there was no

21

collective bargaining relationship between the general

22

contractor, Connell, and the union, whereas in our case

23

there is a collective bargaining relationship between

24

the general contractor and the union.

25

position is demonstrated by looking at the very tenuous

The error in this

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

and insubstantial nature on many occasions of a

2

collective bargaining relationship, and the very broad

3

consequences that under the rule of the Board and the

4

court below attached to that collective bargaining

5

relationship.

6

This can best be shown, I believe, by looking

7

at a very simple specific example.

8

between Local 701 and these AGC general contractors

9

covers the operation of every conceivable kind of heavy

The labor contract

10

construction equipment.

Now, a particular general

11

contractor may himself employ members of Local 701 only

12

occasionally and for very discreet purposes.

13

example, a particular general contractor may employ

14

members of Local 701 only to operate forklifts on a

15

particular job to move lumber for just a couple of

16

months on that one job, and only on that occasion

17

throughout the entire five-year life of the contract.

For

18

That particular general contractor may always,

19

historically, and in every situation subcontract out all

20

other work that involves the operation of heavy

21

construction equipment.

22

out all the excavation work that includes the operation

23

of a shovel and a front-end loader, subcontracts out all

24

of the underground utility work that includes the

25

operation of a backhoe.

He at all times subcontracts

2

laying work that involves the operation of a concrete

4

operation of a crane is involved, subcontracts out all

5

of the sprinkler fitter work that involves a mobile

6

scaffold or a forklift uses the mobile scaffold,

7

subcontracts out all of the landscaping work involving

8

the use of other heavy construction equipment involved,

9

subcontracts out all of the paving work and the driveway

10

work involving the use of graders and rollers and pavers.

11

Now, that general contractor does have a

12

collective bargaining relationship with Local 701.

13

employed a couple of its members on a job for a month.

14

The consequence of this, according to the Labor Board,

15

is that the subcontractor clause is valid, and it

16

applies at all times on all the general contractor's

17

jobs throughout the five-year life of the contract, and

18

that general contractor is prohibited from doing

19

business with any subcontractor whose employees perform

20

any of this work of operating any of that equipment

21

unless that subcontractor has a labor contract with

22

Local 701, and that labor contract requires all of the

23

employees of that subcontractor performing that kind of

24

work on any of the subcontractors' jobs throughout the

25

life of the contract to be members of Local 701, and to

designate Local 701 as their representative.
And furthermore, according to the rule of the

3

Board, and of the court below, Local 701 can picket this

4

general contractor to force him to agree to this clause.

5

It is submitted that the legality of a union's

6

right to top-down organize subcontractors' employees by

7

means of a secondary boycott on all these other jobs at

8

all these other times cannot reasonably depend on

9

whether the general contractor employs at some time on

10

some job one or two members some place of Local 701.

11

Surely, that is not what Congress intended, yet that is

12

the rule of the Board.

13

This Court stated in both National Woodwork

14

and also in Connell that the construction proviso is

15

based on the close community of interests on

16

construction sites.

17

the construction site justifies the limited boycott

18

which does intrude into employee and employer rights.

19

That close community of interest on

When Local 701*s members are employed on a job

at all other times when they are not employed.

means of a secondary boycott cannot justify the

3

intrusion of Local 701 into the rights of employees and

4

employers on other job sites where they are not a part,

5

where the union and Local 701 are not a part of the

6

close community of interests.

7

This subcontractor clause is not confined to

8

those occasions where Local 701 is a part of the close

9

community of interests, and therefore it is not within

10

the purpose of the proviso, and so not within the

11

proviso.

12

There can be no doubt, as this Court stated in

13

Connell, that a major aim of Congress in 1959 was to

14

limit top-down organizing by economic weapons, and there

can be no doubt that this subcontractor clause is

— suppose you found that in 1959,

in the construction industry, this kind of subcontractor

provision from 8(e).

Therefore,

The Court may recall that Section 8(b)(4)(A)

regulation of secondary boycotts, and as this Court

recognized in Sandor, that although it was no defense to

18

an unfair labor practice charge under 8(b)(4)(A) that

19

the struck employer had agreed in advance to boycott a

20

disfavored product, the mere execution of such a

21

contract or its voluntary observance by the employer did

22

not violate Section 8(b)(4)(A).

23

This left certain loopholes in the Act’s

This was regarded as a loophole, and the

24

Landrum-Griffin bill, which passed the House, plugged

25

this loophole completely.

It added a new provision

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which is the equivalent of the main body of the current

2

Section 8(e) that made it unlawful for any labor

3

organization and any employer to enter into an agreement

4

whereby the employer agreed to cease doing business with

5

any other person.

6

Moreover, Section 8(b)(4)(A) was amended also

7

to prescribe strike pressure, to force an employer to

8

agree to such a boycott agreement because, as

9

Representative Griffin explained in a passage that is

10

quoted in our brief, although under existing law it was

11

unlawful to strike to force a secondary employer to

12

cease handling certain products or to cease doing

13

business with some other person, the law, and I am

14

quoting, "does not prohibit the same kind of activity to

15

force such employers to sign contracts or agreements not

16

to handle or transport goods coming from a source

17

characterized by the union as unfair."

18

And indeed, in Sandor, one of the reasons why

19

the Court held that the agreement was no defense to

20

strike pressure to enforce the agreement was that the

21

agreement itself might have been the result of strike

22

pressure.

agreement and the agreement itself, were sought to be

24

plugged in the Landrum-Griffin bill.

that industry, and as is evidenced by the Musser case

I

12

think that it certainly shows that it was part of the

13

pattern, and the Musser case, which was specifically

14

called to Congress’s attention, was clearly a clause of

15

this type, and indeed, the committee was advised that

16

the Board and the court of appeals of the District of

17

Columbia had just held that there was nothing unlawful

18

about such a clause under the 1947 Labor Act, so this is

19

not something that you can say Congress was completely

20

unaware of or that it is a new kind of tactic such as

21

you had in Connell, where the union in an effort to get

22

away from the regulation that 8(b)(7) imposed on

23

organizational picketing structured its activity so that

24

they were seeking a subcontracting clause without

25

undertaking to represent any of the contractors’

employees

2

That is totally different from the typical

3

situation which we have in this case, where the union in

4

seeking a subcontracting clause is seeking it as part of

5

a completed collective bargaining agreement that governs

6

the terms and conditions of employment of the

7

contractor's employees, and it is because of the vital

8

interest that this subcontracting clause has given the

9

short term duration of jobs in the construction industry

10

and the floating pool of workers that the unions of a

11

particular contractor requires clauses of this sort in

12

order to assure a continuity in their negotiated

contract benefits.

And this is what Congress was concerned about

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.,

3

Mr. Gold.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT UNIONS

4

MR. GOLD;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5

please the Court, Mr. Come has already described and set

6

out the language of Section 8(e) and the language of the

7

proviso thereto.

8

that the proviso is not one stated in general terms, but

9

one which deals specifically with the contracting and

I wish to begin by stressing the fact

10

subcontracting of work at a job site.

Obviously, the

11

very language shows a quite particularized intent to

12

take out of the overall prohibition of Section 8(e) a

13

particular type of agreement.
Moreover, in response to Justice White's

14
15

question, we believe that Senator Kennedy's statement

16

describing the proviso deals again in quite specific

17

terms.

18

our brief, the red brief, "Agreements by which a

19

contractor in the construction industry promises not to

20

subcontract work on a construction site to a non-union

21

contractor appear to be legal today."

22

He said, in part, and it is quoted at Page 11 of

23

and the employer are negotiating their contract, and the

24

union wants one of these provisions.

25

suppose if — What interest would the union have in

telling the employer, and by the way, we expect this

2

clause to apply to any site even though none of our

3

members are on that site?

4

MR. GOLD;

Well, the union’s interests are

5

dictated by the nature of the industry.

6

and the passages are guoted at Page 19 of our brief,

7

that Congress at the same time it was considering

8

Landrum-Griffin, whose main thrust was concerned with

9

regulating internal union affairs, also had under

We point out,

10

advisement the provision which became Section 8(f) of

11

the law, and which deals with so-called pre-hire

12

agreements.

13

And in their study of the industry, they noted

14

the following major points.

15

nature of the employment relationship makes this

16

industry markedly different from manufacturing.

17

individual employee typically works for many employers.

18

Moreover, a substantial majority of the skilled

19

employees in this industry constitute a pool of such

20

help centered about their appropriate craft union.

21

One is that the occasional

An

Now, in terms of the union’s interests, it is

22

slightly different on behalf of those employees than the

23

interest of an industrial union dealing with a

24

particular employer.

25

is going to in all likelihood during the term of the

The union knows that the employer

1

contract discontinue particular work and move on to

2

other work.

3

What the union is concerned about, given the

4

normal pattern of this industry in which subcontracting

5

is prevalent is that the organized group of workers who

6

are really attached to the union rather than to any

7

particular employer continue to have opportunities to do

8

the work that the union is negotiating about.

9

it is like trying to hold onto quicksilver without

If not,

10

putting it in a container, because of the capitalization

11

of these employers, because of the fact that work begins

12

and ends frequently.

13

If you don't preserve the work in general

14

terms for this group of union employees, your collective

15

bargaining agreement is going to have little or no value

16

for those employees.

17

be to say to the employer, that is it, no more

18

subcontract.

19

the pattern.

20

Now, to be sure, one answer would

Given this industry, that just hasn't been

Rather, the union's desire has been to make

21

sure that whether that already organized employer does

22

the work or not or whether somebody else does the work,

23

its members, who are in — coming out of the hiring hall

24

along with other people who may want to go through the

25

hiring hall, get the work.

Without this kind of clause,

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 <202) 554-2345

1

unless you ban subcontrating, which would be completely

2

against the whole grain and pattern of the way the

3

industry has grown up, and the unions just haven't had

4

an interest in disrupting that pattern, the collective

5

agreement becomes of little or no worth.

6

That is why unions seek this kind of

7

protection, and that is why, incidentally, as the very

8

language at least of the opinion in Connell suggests, it

9

is rational to posit a difference between situations in

10

which the agreement is part of a collective bargaining

11

arrangement and the situation in Connell where the

12

agreement was designably outside of any collective

13

bargaining arrangement in the hope of getting through a

14

hole that that union had hoped had been created between

15

Section 8(e) and Section 8(b)(7), which banned certain

16

kinds of organizational picketing.

17

In other words, in this situation, the union

18

is seeking to advance the interests of those who have

19

already made a free choice, a choice to join the union

20

and to work under union contracts.

21

an effective way except by banning subcontracting, which

22

would be contrary to the whole tenor of the industry —

QUESTION:

Hell, is your suggestion then that

it is just a — you didn't even need the proviso?
MR. GOLD:

That sounds like a primary --

3

MR. GOLD*

There is a — there is a — there

is an interest relating to a primary group of employees,

5

but they are not considered primary and never have been

7

primary-secondary dichotomy.

9

employees have not done in the past, or if you deal with

If you, for example, seek

10

work being done by other unions, that is secondary, in

11

the strict legal terms.

12

QUESTION*

Well, this would certainly — this

13

kind of a clause, if it were in force, would certainly

14

keep the employer from subcontracting to a subcontractor

15

who is organized by some other union.

16

MR. GOLD*

Yes, that's correct, and given the

17

craft nature of the unions here, they have a very great

18

interest in that.

19

of bargaining here reflects the division of the industry

20

into general and subcontractors.

21

labor side of the industry into various craft units and

22

the overall fact that because of the structure on the

23

employer side and because of the nature of construction

24

you have hundreds of jobs starting and beginning all the

25

time, and you have a practice whereby an individual who

He is less likely to keep it than not.

3

QUESTION:

Are there a fair number of unions

4

who supply laborers both to general contractors and to

5

subcontractors ?

6

MR. GOLD:

It depends.

The answer is that

7

there are such unions.

8

carpenters, the two unions that are involved here, are

9

most likely to do that, because general contractors as

The operating engineers and the

10

the Woelke case shows — Woelke is a sub who does

11

12

carpenters, or they may decide to use subcontractors.

13

General contractors, as the argument on the other side

14

indicates, may do certain kinds of heavy machinery

15

operations themselves, and may decide not to do work of

16

that kind.

17

electricians, a variety of these crafts can work either

18

for general or subs.

19

General contractors use

The same thing is true with laborers,

Also, when you get down to the sub level,

Woelke can give away part of the work it has, and may

21

well do so, depending on how onerous it finds its

interlocking relationships, and when you look at the

2

debate concerning the Denver Building case, which was

3

certainly one element of the consideration in 1959,

4

Congress was well aware that you had these complex

5

relationships leading to the construction of a single

6

overall piece of construction, whether it be a building,

7

a factory, a highway, and that there was an

8

interrelation between these different generals and subs

or people who were primary and secondary contractors,

And part of the disquiet about the Denver

Building case, and certainly a major drive was not

13

simply union and non-union people don’t work very well

14

on a single job together, but also with this very

15

problem that we are discussing, that if you organize a

general contractor, or you organize a subcontractor,

17

given the prevalence of contracting out in this

18

industry, and given the nature of these companies, which

form, reform, create joint ventures, and so on, the

necessarily have him organize unless you have this kind

because of the equally various ways that employers

13
14

similar to the garment industry, which was the only

15

other one which received any exemption from Section

8(e).

17

which make it very difficult to maintain the situation

subcontracting on the site.

preserves the right to enter into subcontracting

agreements.

a point again that Mr. Come made, where one bargaining

structure that was prevalent, and as the London Study

was to require that subcontractors assume agreements

when they take a subcontract, and no one has ever found

11

MR. GOLDS

When you look at those contracts,

what it shows is that the subcontractor had to take the

So, the way I would conclude is that there are

situations in which the language points one way and the

the problem or in terms of explaining what the language,

directions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEWIS K. SCOTT, ESQ.,

Your time has expired

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS IN 80-1808 and 81-91

10

MR. SCOTT;

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

11

I hope to cover three points very briefly.

12

First, how frequent were these kind of clauses in 1959?

13

There are just two studies that suggest that.

14

the London Study, which was not made for this purpose

15

and which the general counsel found inconclusive because

16

it does not distinguish between signatory clauses and

17

other kinds of clauses.

18

own study, which showed that only 12 percent of the

19

clauses in 1959 included signatory clauses of any kind.

20

I must flatly disagree with the statement of Mr. Gold in

21

response to the Court.
QUESTION;

22

First,

Secondly, the general counsel’s

Secondly —

Well, do you also disagree with

23

what he said that no one has ever found an agreement

24

that on its face is the kind that you suggest would be

25

legal?

MR. SCOTT*

Well, Your Honor, of course, an

2

agreement of this kind was not required until after the

3

Act was passed, so there would have been no reason for

4

it.

5

came about after the proviso was enacted.

This distinction, growing out of the proviso, only

6

Second, with respect to what was Congress's

7

awareness in 1959, there are only two places in the

8

entire Congressional Record that suggest an awareness of

9

this particular kind of a clause, and on both of those

10

occasions it was explicitly stated that it was intended

11

that such clauses be illegal, and I refer to our brief

12

on that point.

13
14

I believe it is our reply brief, Page 8.

Thirdly, with respect to the statements of
Senator Kennedy —

15

QUESTION*

Was that before or after the

16

proviso was put into the hopper, the statement that it

17

should be illegal?
MR. SCOTT*

18
19
20
21

They were both before the

proviso —
QUESTION*

So, I mean, there was general

prohibition of all this sort of thing.

22

MR. SCOTT*

23

QUESTION*

Excuse me. Your Honor.
At that time, there was an intent

24

to prohibit all this sort of thing without focusing on

25

the construction industry.

QUESTION:

I mean, making them illegal was

4

part of making all hot cargo clauses and the like

5

illegal.

6

MR. SCOTT:

That is true. Your Honor, but

7

going to my third point, which I believe takes up the

8

point you are making, and

9

statements of Senator Kennedy, upon which they rely,

10

first of all, it has already been noted by the Court

11

that argument proves too much, because the clause in

12

Connell by the same logic would have been unlawful and

13

not within the purpose of the proviso.

14

that is, with respect to the

Secondly, Senator Kennedy's statement that

15

clauses such as this appear to be legal at that time was

16

technically accurate, but it is misleading.

18

this Court’s Sandor case.

19

indicate that a secondary employer could voluntarily not

20

do business with a primary employer, and yet could put

21

that voluntarism on paper, but the reasoning of this

22

Court in Sandor made it very clear that the union could

23

not force that contractor, the primary or the primary

24

employer — pardon me, the secondary employer to boycott

25

the primary employer, nor could it picket the secondary

employer in order to enforce that agreement, nor was

2

that agreement even enforceable in court, because,

3

according to the language and the logic of Justice

4

Frankfurter, that secondary employer at the time he made

5

his decision whether to boycott or not boycott the

6

primary employer had to be unfettered from anything

7

contained in an agreement or otherwise.

8
9

And finally, with respect to Senator Kennedy's
own intentions, I submit they are clear, that his

10

intention was not to legalize this kind of clause.

11

stated that the reason he believed a proviso was

12

necessary to the hot cargo prohibitions was, it seems

13

that a union ought to be able to ask a friendly concern

14

to stop dealing with a company which will not observe

15

fair labor standards, and that is Senator Kennedy's own

16

specific statement as to why this exception was needed.

17

That is at Two Legislative History, 1708, on August 20,

18

1959.
