ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES NEVETT STEELE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. STEELE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

10 the Court:
11

Amongst the responsibilities of the Federal

12 Election Commission is that of administering the
13 Presidential Election Campaign Fund Act.

That is the Act

14 contained at Chapter 95 of subtitle H of the Internal
15 Revenue Cole which provides that in the general election a
16 grant of money to the candidates of political parties.

In

17 the 1980 election the grant to the candidates of the major
18 parties was $29.4 million.

The statute provides that that

19 grant goes to the candidate of the party within ten days of
20 his nomination, if he chooses it.

21

The statute makes the public funding provision

22 optional for the candidates of all parties.
23 the public funding,

If they accept

they agree to expenditure limitations

24 not to exceed the amount of the grant, $29.4 million.

25 also agree not to accept private contributions.

They

1

The statute has been twice challenged

The first

2 time it was challenged was in the case of Buckley v. Valeo
3 decided by this Court.

The challenge there was majorly one

4 under the Fifth Amendment, though there was a First
5 Amendment challenge on an analogy to the freedom of
6 religion.

But the major challenge there was that the

7 statute as constructed discriminated, discriminated against
8 minor parties and new parties on the grounds that by
9 providing the amounts of money before the election to the
10 major parties that it unfairly advantaged them against
11 parties which could not obtain that pre-election funding.
12

This Court rejected that challenge.

It concluded

13 that the Congressional decision to provide for public
14 financing was one well within its power, its power to
15 legislate to protect elections, decided by this Court in
16 Burroughs v. United States; and that the power over
17 elections was such that this was a valid exercise of
18 Congress’ power under the general welfare clause to expend
19 the monies that it raises.
20

QUESTION*

It was also challenged on the grounds

21 that it prohibited expenditures by individual candidates of
22 their own money, and it was struck down in that regard, was

23 it not?
24

MR. STEELE*

Yes, it was.

25 involves a third challenge to it,

This case really

I think, a challenge that

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 was not raised in Buckley; the statute then was identical
2 and was not raised in the second case, which was the
3 Republican National Committee, which was a case that was
4 brought on behalf of the supporters of the Republican
5 candidates in the 1980 election.

And the challenge there

6 was a straight First Amendment challenge not similar to the
7 one in Buckley, but that the statute, by requiring the
8 candidates to agree to an expenditure limit, abridged the
9 rights of the candidate's supporters; that the supporters by
10 being closed out in the public financing system had their
11 First Amendment rights abridged.
12

This Court, affirming the decisions of a

13 three-judge District Court in the en banc court for the
14 Second Circuit, concluded that there was no such violation
15 of First Amendment rights.

As set forth in the court's

16 decisions below, they noted that individuals in the public
17 financing system have substantial opportunities for
18 participating in that system, and listed them there.
19

In effect, this is a third challenge.

This is a

20 challenge to the First Amendment, another First Amendment

21 challenge, that the supporters of the Republican candidate
22 have their First Amendment rights violated because
23 contributions that they wish to make cannot be translated
24 into independent expenditures by political committees;
25 rather than the challenge in the RNC case which was that
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 their First Amendment rights of supporters were abridged
2 because they could not give to the candidate, and the
3 candidate could not expend those monies.
4

This is a challenge that those supporters’ First

5 Amendment rights are violated because they cannot give that
6 money to a political committee which will in turn transform
7 those into expenditures.
8

The case arose in the following fashion.

In the

9 early summer of 1980 the three respondents announced plans
10 that they would each raise funds, take contributions,
11 aggregate those funds, take contributions from corporate
12 PACs, take contributions from union PACs, take contributions
13 from other political committees, take contributions from
14 individuals.
15

They qualified themselves as multi-candidate

16 committees under the statute.

Those multi-candidate

17 committees are permitted to take contributions of f5,000
18 under the statute in this Court's decision in Buckley, as
19 opposed to those of other political committees which are
20

21

limited to f1,000 contributions.
They announced plans that they were going to raise

22 these monies and expend them on the grounds that they had an
23 unlimited right to make those kind of expenditures.

There

24 was no application as to whether or not the Act applied to
25 thosei though I would note that one of the respondents, the
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Americans for an Effective Presidency, sought and then
2 withdrew for an opinion, an advisory opinion from the
3 Commisssion as to whether the statute prohibited their
4 activities, indicating that they felt that there was a
5 constitutional problem; but that opinion was withdrawn.
6

Beyond that, none of them applied for what the Act

7 does provide, which is a declaration as to whether the Act
8 prohibits the activities that they were involved —
9

QUESTION;

Nr. Steele, I gather back in 1976 -- am

10 I right — the Commission suggested that these were really
11 independent expenditures that probably wouldn't come within
12 to further the election of candidates.

Is that so in, you

13 know, the case of that GOP Feminist Caucus on the buttons
14 for President Ford?
15

SR. STEELE:

16 decision.

Yes.

That was not a Commission

That was an informational letter.

That was

17 during the period after Buckley when the Commission —
18

QUESTION:

Well, has the Commission -- may I put

19 it this way — interpreted

subdivision (f) as inapplicable

20 if they are in fact independent expenditures?
21

SR. STEELE:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. STEELE:

24 respondents

I think that the Commission has not.
Ha s not.
The arguments that I understand the

to be making are, first, that the Commission in

25 considering regulations in

1976 after this Court's decision
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in Buckley, the Commission after its reconstitution in May
2 had hearings during June and July attempting to get
3 regulations in place for the 1976 election.
4

During those hearings there was a substantial

5 portion of those hearings, two days of those hearings, half
6 of two days of those, devoted to the question of 9012(f).
7 Respondents argue that the Commission, by not adopting a
8 regulation that repeated the words of the statute, indicated
9 that somehow that the Commission had decided that that was
10 not applicable to independent expenditures.
11

I don't see how the nonadoption of the statutory

12 words in a regulation yields that result.
13

QUESTION;

But in any event, your answer to me is

14 the Commission never has in fact constituted the statute as
15 inapplicable to so-called independent expenditures by these
16 —
17

MR.

18

QUESTION:

19 the statute

STEELE; That is correct.
And that's your position today, that

can't be read that way.

20

MR.

STEELE; That's correct.

21

With regard to the informational letter that you

22 asked about, as I say, that was an informational letter
23 coming out of
24 there

the staff.

I think thatthere islanguage

that is probably — cuts againstthat position,

25 don't think

in

but

that was an official Commission position.
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

And

I

1 moreover, the requesting party there said right up what it
2 was doing was the so-called button and bows exemption which
3 was enacted in

'79 — small, less than $1,000, small items.

4 And the real question there was there was that —
5

QUESTIONS

But I gather the Commission's position

6 is that we can't avoid deciding the constitutional question.
7

MB. STEELE:

That is correct.

8

As I was saying, I think that one of the

9 respondents here, the Americans for Change, argues to this
10 Court that there is an interpretation of the statute which
11 would allow it to avoid that.

They did not seek an

12 interpretation before the Commission.

The other parties all

13 seem to agree that basically the statute prohibits it.
14

In any event, the activity was undertaken on the

15 grounds of the feelings of the respondents that their
16 constitutional rights allowed them to do that activity.
17

In the face of these plans, the Commission, which

18 under the statute in Section 9011(b)

of Title 26 is

19 authorized to bring suits to implement or construe

20 provisions of the Fund Act, brought this suit, brought it in
21 the statutorily raguired three-judge District Court for the
22 District of Columbia.
23

QUESTION:

Before you go on, what about a

24 committee that was formed,

an independent committee that was

25 formed not to support any candidate, but in a three-way
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 political campaign, three candidates, three major
2 candidates.

This committee devoted itself entirely to being

3 against, to the defeat of one of them in circumstances where
4 taking votes away from that one would clearly favor one of
5 the other two.
6

MR. STEELE*

7

QUESTION*

8

MR. STEELE*

Yes.
What about that kind of a committee?
That is a question which has never

9 come in front of the Commission, so that my answer would be,
10 is not something that an interpretation that I think the
11 Commission in any way has made.

But it would seem that the

12 terms of the statute are to further the election of a
13 candidate, and that an expenditure to defeat one, even where
14 there are three, would be one that would further the
15 election of anybody but.

So that I would think that there

16 is an argument under the statute that that certainly is
17 something that would further the election.

18

I would reiterate again that I do not think that

19 that question has been posed to the Commission, either by

20 the facts of this case or in any request for an advisory —
21

QUESTION*

And you don't think that's any

22 interference with First Amendment rights?
23

MR. STEELE*

Well, I think that under Buckley v.

24 Valeo and numerous other Court decisions of this Court, but

25 Buckley v. Valeo most prominently because it is in the area,
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that this Court has articulated a balancing standard; that
2 the rights, the First Amendment rights, I think that there
3 are First Amendment rights implicated here, because there is
4 under this Court's decision in Buckley v. Valeo, there is
5 the expenditure of money to achieve statements of political
6 ends.
7

But the court below, I think, which found the

8 statute constitutional, in effect sail that the balance that
9 Congress here struck in trying to protect individual rights
10 in the public financing scheme was not a valid one.

But I

11 think it very clear, and I hope that our brief which I will
12 try not to go through all of the legislative history, but do
13 not thereby wish to avoid what I think is one of the major
14 thrusts of our brief, which is that Congress considered this
15 statute, considered the problems, including the
16 constitutional problems, and struck a balance that it felt
17 that did what its major purpose was, which was to, under the
18 federal funding statute, which was to create a substitute
19 for private financing, to allow within that, to allow

20 individuals substantial opportunities to continue to
21 participate in the elections.
22

Again, I cited the RNC case where I think there

23 was a long recitation of those.
24 the ends of our brief.

We have set those forth in

But there are substantial rights

25 protected by the statute.

It is not considered to be a
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 contribution under the statute for a person to offer their
2 services.

It is not considered a contribution under the

3 statute for people to travel on behalf of a candidate up to
4 an amount of $2,000.

There is an exemption for use of

5 homes, and it's broadened so that it's not merely a personal
6 home but in effect is shelter,, and that there are
7 substantial opportunities for individuals to participate.
8

Section 9012(f) itself makes very clear, and if

9 it's not clear by the fact that it refers only to political
10 committees, it seems to me it's clear from the legislative
11 history that Congress balanced to allow individuals to make
12 expenditures under the statute.
13

QUESTIONS

Is it your position that only the

14 Commission may bring an action under 9011(b) to implement or
15 construe the Act before a three-judge court?
16

SR. STEELE*

The statute provides for other

17 parties to bring such an action, so I think it is not the
18 Commission's position that only the Commission can.
19 question in my mind

The

then becomes, and I would in a sense say

20 that the jurisdictional question there then becomes whether
21 or not the action is one really to implement or construe the
22 statute; that in effect that what I would say is that it is
23 not

a substitute for actions to enforce the Act under 437(g)

24 or other provisions.
25

QUESTION*

Which might involve fact-finding in

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that certainly.
2

MR. STEELE:

Yes.

3

Congress, in enacting the public financing

4 statute, explicitly sought to establish it as an alternate
5 to private financing — not a mandatory alternate but one
6 chosen by the candidate.

In so doing, Congress looked at

7 what it saw as the reality of political life and debated the
8 problem that would arise if having limited that fund,
9 committees were able to be formed to expend unlimited
10 amounts of money and thereby to in effect dwarf the fund.
11

For Congress saw, Congress debated — indeed, at

12 pages 22 and 23 of our — 21 and 22 of our brief, going
13 slightly over to 23, is a series of debates in the 1971
14 history.

We have earlier referred to the fact of the

151966-67 history which first drafted the statute.
16 were attempts to go both ways.

But there

There were attempts by some

17 Senators to say if you allow a thousand dollars per
18 committee, you are allowing a substantial loophole.
19 allowing

You are

— there will be committees formed all over the

20 place that will expend money in amounts up to a thousand
21 dollars, and it will substantially undercut the fund.
22
23 idea

There were amendments that sought to reject the
that individuals could spend money, saying that well,

24 if you allow individuals to spend money, they, too,
25 undercut the fund.

will

There were other attempts to amend the
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 statute to say well, we need to broaden this.
2 let more come out here.

We need to

There was substantial talk, of the

3 constitutional rights of individuals.

And in effect, the

4 choice that the Congress made -- and I think it’s clear in
5 that history and clear in the statute — was an attempt to
6 prohibit large, aggregated wealth from dominating over the
7 public fund, while protecting the individual rights.
8

Turning to the question — the decision of the

9 District Court below, the three-judge District Court below,
10 the court there analyzed this case as basically one that
11 involved only the pooling of funds.

In effect, they

12 rejected the Congressional assessment of the fact that
13 political committees, particularly large, multi-candidate
14 committees such as these, were very different from
15 individuals who merely pooled funds.

In effect, the

16 decision of the court below suggests that as pooling agents
17 these committees directly exercise the First Amendment
18 rights that an individual would be doing.
19

The Congressional judgment was very different.

20 The Congressional judgment was that this was not central to
21 the individual's right.

And the question of the statutory

22 test comes forward here.
23
24 Buckley v.

I would say that under this Court's decision in
Valeo that the test of a public financing statute

25 such as this is whether it serves a rational basis, and

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

that

1 in that vein that the Congressional decision that in order
2 to protect this fund, in order to have this fund not dwarfed
3 so that a candidate looking out over the whole political
4 scene would not have to think I know that out there there is
5 substantial amounts of money; I must woo that money, if I am
6 going to be successful in my candidacy.

And people can

7 spend, as the three committees here did, approximately $9
8 million in the course of election, a sum that's roughly
9 one-third of that which the public fund provides.
10

If they look out in future years knowing that in

11 this election there were these three respondents and two
12 other committees that did that, but that there are some
13 1,200 political action committees of corporations, political
14 action committees of unions that will, if the decision below
15 is upheld, be able to spend that kind of money, any
16 candidate will have to woo that money.
17 consider that the positions he

He will have to

takes, the arguments he makes

18 will necessarily be swayed by the expenditure of that money;
19 and

that is precisely what Congress sought to avoid with the

20 public financing statute.

21

For one of the purposes approved by this Court was

22 the ability to free the candidate from having to seek those
23 private funds, put forward this system of public financing
24 as a substitute,

not merely as a supplement.

25 this Court's decision,

And indeed, in

the rationale for rejecting the Fifth
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Amendment challenge, the discriminatory challenge, was
2 precisely that; that the new parties and so forth were not
3 disadvantaged because there was this cap, because there was
4 this substitute.

They could seek, money; they could seek

5 money outside the system.

And therefore, though the major

6 parties were given this subsidy, the minor parties were not
7 disadvantaged in the constitutional sense because they were
8 still able to raise the private funds.
9

QUESTION*

Let me put a variation of the

10 hypothetical I had put to you earlier.

Suppose a committee,

11 an independent committee is formed for the stated and
12 publicized purpose of getting out the largest possible,
13 maximum vote, and it is clear in that setting that the
14 maximum, the larger the vote, the large vote will favor one
15 of the candidates.
16

Would you say that that would fall in the same way

17 that a committee formed to defeat one candidate because it
18 has an influence on the election?
19

MR. STEELE:

I think that though perhaps in

20 reality one might be able to decide that getting out the
21 vote overall might benefit one candidate, I think that
22 that's a decision -- to say that that was what Congress
23 meant of furthering the election of one candidate would be
24 astray; in effect, that legally

the getting out the vote —

25 and indeed, the statute very explicitly protects get out the
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 vote activity in a number of ways; indeed, it's a question
2 that the Commission has wrestled within the context of
3 whether simple signs saying "Get out the vote," paid for by
4 committees and so forth, are ones that violate the statute.
5 But that in effect that get out the vote, even though one
6 might be able in a political science sense to say that it
7 had indeed advantaged one candidate over the other, was not
8 what Congress was aiming at when it was speaking of
9 furthering the election of a candidate.
10

The court below spoke in terms of the fact that

11 there was no quid pro quo here; there was no possibility of
12 a quid pro quo between these independent committees and that
13 of the candidate.

Again, it would seem that that judgment

14 is one in which the court below says that, in effect, that
15 the Congress was wrong, because the Congress' judgment, in
16 effect, was first of all that the interest here was for
17 public financing, to protect the public financing; that
18 there did not need to be a quid pro quo.
19

Even accepting the argument that a quid pro quo is

20 necessary, that corruption is necessary or the appearance of
21 corruption is necessary, the court below did not really come
22 to grips with the Congressional judgment that if you had
23 large-scale committees like this, you were inevitably in a
24 situation where a candidate needed to pay attention

to what

25 those committees brought forth, needed, in effect, to decide
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that if he did not pay attention to what those committees
2 were advocating, he would not be able to — he would not be
3 as likely to be as successful in his election campaign.
4

In effect, Congress'

judgment was that the dangers

5 of

a quid pro quo that were there were very great, and

that

6 in

any event that if you have a public financing system set

7 forth by $29.4 million, if the private funding goes well
8 beyond that in the terms that we have set forth in our
9 briefs, that many of the Senators use, that committees will
10 be

created to go beyond the authorization of this Act;

11 if

you have a system where the private funding is $60

that

12 million or $90 million — that was not true in this
13 election; it was $9 million roughly, as I say, one-third —
14 but that if you have a situation such as that, that you have
15 the public fund being merely a takeoff point.
16 a subsidy.

It is merely

It is a subsidy then to the parties, the major

17 parties or to minor parties who have obtained the five
18 percent in the last election, which would not be for the
19 full $29.4 million but in a ratio.

But that there is only

20 then a system not of a substitute of public financing, but
21 of a system where public financing is a supplement to
22 private financing.
23

The Congress rejected that idea, rejected that

24 idea in the basic statute, rejected that idea in

9012(f)

25 itself explicitly.
18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

As I say, I do not want to

I certainly don't

2 have the time to go through all the Congressional history
3 again* but I would make once more the point that I think.
4 that our brief has set forth, is that this was a very
5 explicit Congressional choice.

This was not something that

6 crept up unawares on the Congress.
7 '66-*67.

Congress debated this in

When the statute came back in '71, it occupied

8 them for a long period of time during those debates.

As I

9 say, there were amendments back and forth.
10

The Congressional choice here was to protect

11 public financing and to prohibit the private financing by
12 political committees.

It made a very distinct balancing.

13 It does not prohibit it entirely.

It allowed it up to a

14 thousand dollars for these political committees.

Again,

15 these political committees are aggregations of wealth.
16

I would reserve the remainder.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARCHIBALD COX, ESQ.,

19

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

20

MR. COX:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

21 Court:
22

The issues in this case have extraordinary

23 importance, not only because they implicate the First
24 Amendment but also because the decision will profoundly
25 influence, if not determine for many years in the future the

role of aggregated wealth from presidential elections.
The central question as we see it here is whether

3 Congress has the power to restrict the aggregation and
4 expenditure of wealth by political committees, by
5organizations whose primary purpose is to support a
6 candidate for election, where the presidential candidate has
7 agreed to accept public funds in lieu of private financing
8 of his campaign.
9

That question, we submit, was not decided in

10 Buckley and Valeo.

That case was concerned with a sweeping

11 ban on all independent expenditures,

including expenditures

12 by individuals, by a wile variety of associations.
13

Section 9012(f), on the other hand, restricts only

14 expenditures by political committees;

that is to say, by

15 centrally managed organizations whose major purpose is to
16 raise money by widespread solicitation of contributions, and
17 then having

aggregated the funds, to promote the election of

18 a candidate.
19

We submit the restriction does not violate the

20 First Amendment essentially

for two reasons.

First, it

21 serves the important purpose of preserving the integrity of
22 government and

public confidence in the integrity of

23 government against

the corrosive effects of private

24 financing in presidential election campaigns.

And second,

25 it leaves wide scope for political speech and expression by

20

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 individuals and by groups, including various associations
2 other than political committees as I have defined them.

QUESTION;

Mr. Cox, what do you do with respect to

4 the Court of Appeals treatment of your standing at pages 28a
5 and page 29a of the jurisdictional statement?
6
7 be

MR. COX:

Me say first that that question need not

faced by this Court, because of the decision

in McCulloch

8 against the Society of Honduran Seamen in 372 U.S.
9 There the court had two cases before it.

10.

In one of them the

10 plaintiffs’ standing and the jurisdiction of the District
11 Court was established.

In the other case it was debated, as

12 it would be debated here.

And this Court held in the

13 McCulloch case — that was the flags of convenience case
14 that some of you will remember -- that it could go to the
15 merits in both cases.
16

So I think. Your Honors do not need to be concerned

17 with

that question.

The case, we submit, of course, should

18 be

remanded; and we would think that that would

19 to

be fought out again in the District Court.

20

QUESTION:

be an issue

So you're arguing basically the same

21 position as the Commission has argued.
22

NR. COX:

That’s correct.

Of course, when that

23 question requires decision -- and we have covered it in our
24 papers on the jurisdictional statement

-- when that question

25 requires consideration, then we would be at odds.

But I

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 don't think this Court has decided.

If the Court does go

2 into it, it’s covered in our papers in the answer to the
3 motion to dismiss or affirm.
4

In developing the constitutionality of the

5 statute, I acknowledge, of course, that the restriction in
69012(f) impinges on freedom of speech and freedom of
7 association.

But those rights, we submit, as this Court has

8 often held, are not absolute.

There is some room for

9 balancing where the restriction is targetei to protect the

10 public.

Again, this faces evil other than some evil

11 supposed to be inherent in the ideas or the information
12 expressed and its effect on the minds of the public.
13

QUESTION*

Those two rights you referred to, Hr.

14 Cox, they come about as near, as near to being absolute as
15 any of the First Amendment rights, do they not?
16

HR. COX;

The Court has often said that they are

17 subject to qualification if we satisfy the strict scrutiny
18test, and here we submit that we do satisfy that test.

The

19 Fund Act, as I said, was framed and enacted to secure the
20 integrity of government and the confidence of people in the
21 integrity of government.

And this Court on previous

22 occasions has recognized that those are sufficient and
23 compelling, sufficiently compelling interests to survive the
24 strict scrutiny test.
25

Now, developing the compelling purpose, the
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 corrosive effects of private financing of presidential
2 campaigns have, of course, been well documented both in
3 Congress, this Court, and in other writings.

Then Congress

4 determined to eliminate them by an offer to substitute
5 public funding so that the presidential candidate, in the
6 words of Senator Pastore, might take office a free man,
7 might take office neither himself nor his appointees, his
8 administration in any way beholden to those who had put up
9 the money to elect him.
10

The Congress was also aware that to secure that

11 purpose it had to go beyond simply forbidding the acceptance
12 of contributions and the expenditure by the candidate and
13 his authorized committees of more than the amount of the
14 public fund — in the 1980 election, $30 million a piece.
15

Congress realized, and as Mr. Steele said, it was

16 explicitly discussed, that there was grave danger of
17 subterfuge, meaning evasion not deceit? that there was grave
18 danger of circumvention simply by friends of the candidate,
19 those who had long been in his party moving out, setting up
20 over here, without consultation, an independent committee.

21 They’d all worked together for years.
22 for any kind of consultation.

There'd be no need

And indeed, history shows

23 that there's very grave danger that that amount of private

24 money might very well swamp the public funding.
25

In addition, we submit, the Congress had ample
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 basis for concluding that the members of political
2 committees who raise contributions and spend money to elect
3 the President, independently as they characterize them,
4 present a threat of actual or apparent undue influence upon
5 the successful candidates in this race.
6

This really, it's a matter of common sense, I

7 suggest.

There's not much difference between the position

8 of the man who says I contributed $5 ,000, $25,000 — it
9 couldn’t be $25,000 now, but $5,000 — to the President's
10 election; I want an appointment with the Assistant Secretary
11 for this or that department.

And the money, as has often

12 been put, serves as a right to get in the door and to get a
13 sympathetic hearing.
14

Well, there's not much difference in the case of

15 someone who says I spent, I raised and spent by a political
16 committee $5 million.

I would like a hearing with so and

17 so, and a sympathetic hearing.

And the effect, of course in

18 some cases there's no effect, and we wish there would never
19 be an effect.
20

In other cases one doesn't know.

The danger was the converse of an expression of

21 Justin Dart that we quote in our brief, "Dialogue with
22 politicians is a fine thing, but with a little money they
23 hear you better."

And I suspect that in an election where

24 there can be no private contributions, having spent a large
25 sum of money may lead to being heard better.

Neither House nor Senate is yet publicly

And this, of course, even with the President

7

Otherwise, unlike the situation in Buckley and

10 Valeo, the restriction on spending even by
11 committees does not come in to play.

political

It is only where the

12 candidates so choose it.

This summer there was a particularly egregious

13
14

example of the kind of coercion that may be implicit or may

15

be made explicit with respect to expenditures.

16

Chairman of NCPAC, closely associated with the Fund for the

17

Conservative Majority, wrote to Congressman Badillo if you

18

will make a public statement in support of the President's

19

tax cut package and state that you intend to vote for it, we

20

will withdraw all radio and newspaper ads planned in your

21 district.

The National

In addition, we will be glad to run radio and

22 newspaper ads applauding you for taking that position on

25

taxes.
Now, I don't think usually the threat would be
made that blatantly.

Indeed, here one may wonder whether it
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 doesn't even approach bribery.

But this sort of thing is

2 implicit over and over again, and Congress said we don't
3 want it to take place.

We think forbidding it is essential

4 to put the President and his administration into office free
5 men.
6

We've quoted in our briefs the opinions of

7 externs, pointing out that those who have the hold on the
8 candidate aren't the people who contribute to the political
9 committee; they're the people who raise and control and
10 spend the money.

And as I said before, I think the danger

11 from expenditure is

just about as great as the danger when

12 they raise contributions for the candidate directly.
13

QUESTION;

How about the danger from donation of

14 services as such?

QUESTION:

Hell, how about someone who takes off

7 six months from his job and simply canvasses the country

10 some feeling of obligation to look out for him.
11 don't think it's as serious.

I just

And I don't think the failure

12 to cover that renders the statute so seriously
13 underinclusive as to make it —
14

QUESTION:

Mr. Cox, your position does require

15 some method of distinguishing between these expenditures,
16 which you say may be limited, and the kinds of expenditures
17 that the Court said could not be limited in Buckley,

namely

18 independent expenditures by an individual.

is said.

How, that means that there are many forms of

15 expression that 608 (e),

which was held unconstitutional in

16 Buckley and Valeo, forbade, that the present statute doesn't
17 reach even in the context of public funding, which itself is
18a definite.

It doesn't reach individual expression.

It

19 doesn't reach individuals acting jointly where it's short of
20 being an organization.
21

QUESTIONS

Let me ask you something.

I suppose

22 that if a committee like this rather than directly
23 supporting a candidate spent a lot of money on issues
24 without mentioning a candidate, that this section wouldn't
25 reach that?
28

MR. COX:

Hell, if it’s an issue-oriented

2 organization, it's not a political committee, to begin with.
3

QUESTION:

Although it certainly may have a large

MR. COX:

If it's an issue-oriented organization,

It was formed in

But its sole — all it does is advocate

12

MR. COX:

Well, then I think the question would be

13 whether it could be found -- if it's really focusing on the
14 issues and it wishes to win the day on those issues, then I
15 would say it was not covered by Section 9012(f).

QUESTION:

Even, Mr. Cox, if the issue is one

18 supported by one candidate and opposed by the other, so that
19 the expenditures by the pro-issue people would benefit one

21

MR. COX:

I'm trying to relate this in ray mind to

22 the words of the statute:

"knowingly and willfully further

23 the election of a candidate.”

I have no doubt that the case

24 is covered where if it's a political committee, if they say

Let me ask you, would you accept or

ME. COX

Hell, I wouldn't think so, Mr. Justice,

2 because that first, as the Court indicated in Buckley and
3 Valeo, it must be an organization, the major purpose of
4 which is to elect candidates.

And second, it must have a

5 specific intent, knowingly and willfully to further the
6 candidate.
7

If it's genuinely concerned with its issue or if

8 its major purpose overall is the issue, then it's not
9 covered by 9012(f).

I think that would cover just about all

10 issue orientations.
11

QUESTION;

But the way you put that would -- I'm

12 not sure that's very much different from this limitation
13 that I am suggesting to you.
14

MR. COX;

It would — the difference would be

15 where the advertisement is clearly focused on the election
16 of a candidate, but they avoid the use of, were it, the
17 name.

The express way in the limiting definition is one

18 that we would not adopt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN W. BARAN, ESQ.,

22

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

23

MR. BARAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

24 the Court;
25

With your indulgence I wish to discuss for just a
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 couple of minutes exactly what type of committees are before
2 you and the activities that they undertook with respect to
3 the 1980 election.
4

Appellee committees -- Americans For Change, Fund

5 For A Conservative Majority, and Americans For An Effective
6 Presidency -- are voluntary associations supported solely
7 through voluntary, statutorily-limited contributions,
8 primarily by thousands of individuals across the country.
9 They have been duly registered with the Federal Election
10 Commission; they file regular reports disclosing all of
11 their receipts and all their disbursements.
12

In 1980 these committees solicited and accepted

13 the voluntary contributions with the understanding that the
14 funds would be used to purchase comm unications to support
15 the candidacy of the Republican nominee at that time, former
16 Governor Ronald Reagan.
17

The sort of expression that was purchased by these

18 committees include newspaper advertisements, radio and
19 television advertising, letters, flyers, brochures, even
20 bumper strips and buttons.

Some of these samples of

21 expression undertaken in 1980, and which is the expression
22 that is challenged by the Appellants in this case, are

23 reproduced in the Appendix to the brief of Americans For
24 Change.
25

Mr. Cox referred to an attempted distinction
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 between issue discussion and candidate discussion.

I would

2 direct the Court's attention to Appendix A, which is a
3 newspaper advertisement that depicts what Americans For
4 Change believe to be the record of President Jimmy Carter on
5 various issues concerning jobs,, the budget, inflation, and
6 with the record of Ronald Reagan when he was Governor of
7 California.
8

I don't know where the Appellants wish to draw the

9 line for purposes of the statute that is at issue here, but
10 certainly that same advertisement either in its present form
11 is dealing with issue discussion of those issues that
12 surrounded the campaign in 1980, or perhaps with some
13 deletion of a word here or a word there it would to the
14 satisfaction of Appellants.
15
16 political

With respect towhen an organization

becomes a

committee underthe Federal Election Campaign Act,

17 we cite to several advisory opinions that have been issued
18 in the course of several years by the Federal Election
19 Commission concerning when a group becomes a political
20 committee

for purposes ofnot only the Federal Election

21 Campaign Act but the Fund Act

as well.

And in that

22 collection of opinions, which appears on pages 34 and 35 in

23 Footnote 38 — this is the brief of Americans For Change -24 includes a loose association -- that is the Commission's

25 phrase -- a loose association that in 1980 published a
33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 summary of positions by candidates Reagan, Carter and
2 Anderson concerning "key moral and religious liberty
3 issues."

And that organization was held by the Commission

4 to be a political committee.

The types of advertising and communication

6 undertaken by these committees in 1980 were done so without
7 the cooperation or consultation or direction or control of
8 Ronald Reagan or his campaign.
9 case by all the parties.

That is conceded in this

They are as such independent

10 expenditures, which is not only a statutorily-defined term
11 contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act, but is a
12 concept that was very clearly recognized by this Court in
13 Buckley v. Valeo, and referred to more recently in the
14 California Hedical Association case.
15

These are expenditures for communications that

16 expressly advocate the election or defeat of a clearly
17 identified candidate which have been undertaken by, in this
18 case,

committees without the consultation, direction, or

19 control of the candidate.
20

We seek affirmance of the unanimous decision of

21 the three-judge court for two basic reasons.

First, we

22 believe that there is a construction which is not only
23 proper but one which Congress had in mind when it passed
24 Section

9012(f) ten years ago, which would not make that

25 statute applicable to independent expenditures.

In the

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 alternative, if the statute is construed, as suggested by
2 the Appellants, to apply to independent expenditures, then
3 it is unconstitutional under the First Amendment for the
4 reasons and principles enunciated by this Court in Buckley
5 v. Valeo.
6

Mr. Steele indicated, that the Federal Election

7 Commission had not come forth with any construction as to
8 what constitutes an expenditure to further the election of a
9 candidate, and in fact, in response to questions from the
10 Court was hardly precise as to what that term means.
11

Expenditures to further the election of a

12 candidate are the types of expenditures that are limited by
13 Section 9012(f).

This action, which is brought under

14 Section 9011(b), I assume seeks to implement and construe
15 this section.

Since we are not challenging the

16 constitutionality in the sense of having brought this case
17 before the court below, we were sued.

The Appellants are

18 the ones who brought this suit to implement and construe
19 Section

20

9012(f).
9012(f), when it was passed ten years ago, made

21 sense as a limitation on coordinated expenditures by
22 unauthorized committees.

It may not make a great deal of

23 sense today because in the intervening ten years we have not
24 only had the Fund Act passed, but also the Federal Election
25 Campaign Act of

1971, and three subsequent major amendments
35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to both those acts, plus this Court’s decision in Buckley v.
2 Valeo.
3

These campaign financing statutes have gone

4 through tremendous readjustment, upheaval, repeal, sections
5 held unconstitutional by this Court# and the way they exist
6 today are hardly the way that they perhaps were originally
7 envisioned back in 1971, and certainly would not be advance
8 of the model of draftsmanship and clarity.
9

But back in 1971 there were no limitations on

10 contributions.

The general limitations on contributions

11 were not enacted by Congress until 1974.
12

QUESTION*

The '71 act simply required the

13 approval of the candidate for any media expense, did it not?
14

MR. BARAN:

That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.

15 The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, which is a
16 separate piece of legislation from the Fund Act in which
179012(f) is contained, in its original form contained a
18 limitation on all candidates,

not just publicly financed

19 candidates but privately financed candidates for President,

20 House and Senate, and that limitation set a dollar amount as
21 to what expenditures the candidates could make for media
22 communications, the same communications that these
23 committees undertook in 1980 —
24 and radio advertising.

newspaper ads, television

And in addition to setting the

25 limitation, the Congress placed in that statute in Title 1
36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

a

1 certification process, all of which is described in
2 considerable detail in the opinion of the Court in ACLU v.
3 Jennings, which is set forth in our brief.

And this

4 certification process required any individual, group or
5 committee to obtain the written permission of the candidate
6 before they would be able to purchase advertising from a
7 broadcaster or from a magazine or publication.
8

So ironically, this formula, this statute, which

9 was considered by the Senate three months before they
10 considered Section 9012(f) and the Fund Act, if it had been
11 able to pass constitutional muster in ACLU v. Jennings and
12 had continued in existence in this original form up to the
131980 election, these committees would not have been able to
14 undertake the advertising and activity that they did without
15 having first gone to Bonald Reagan and getting his
16 permission, because the broadcasters would have denied them
17 the opportunity to

purchase that type of advertising, as

18 would have the newspapers.
19

We point out in our brief that it was not the Fund

20 Act or 9012(f)

that Congress chose to address in seeking to

21 limit independent expression in campaigns.

Through the

22 history of campaign financing legislation the Congress has
23 consistently utilized the Federal Election Campaign Act as a
24 vehicle by which they in various forms sought to limit
25 independent expenditures.
37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The first such effort was the Title 1 provision

2 that I have just described.

When that was held

3 unconstitutional by the three-judge court in ACLU v.
4 Jennings, in 1974 Congress enacted another limitation of
5$1,000 on independent expenditures, and that limitation was
6 Section 608(e) that this Court, reviewed in Buckley v. Valeo
7 and struck down as unconstitutional.
8

After that decision, the Congress essentially

9 threw up its hands and said we cannot limit the genuinely
10 independent activities of individuals or groups or
11 committees as long as they are out there acting on their own
12 and not under the direction or control of the candidate.
13 And since that time we have had no further attempts by
14 Congress to impose this type of a limitation in any other
15 form.
16

The legislative history surrounding both the Title

17 1 provision as well as Section 9012(f) is set forth in great
18 detail in our brief.

It does not support the contention of

19 Appellants that Congress sought to specifically limit the
20 types of activities that these committees have undertaken.
21 There is no clarity in either the reports of the Congress or
22 on the floor debates that when 9012(f)

was enacted, Congress

23 was thinking about regulating the so-called organized

24 committees that were going to operate independently of the
25 candidate.

1

QUESTION;

Now, what's your suggestion as to the

2 type of expenditures that Section (f) does reach?
3

MR. BARAN;

Your Honor, these would be what I

4 would characterize as coordinated expenditures.
5

QUESTION;

I thought you said — I don't know —

6 what are those?
7

MR. BARANs

Those would be expenditures that have

8 been made at the direction or control of the candidate or in
9 consultation or cooperation.

There is a very lengthy

10 provision in the Federal Election Campaign Act —
11

QUESTION;

But you said a while ago, you said

12 coordinated expenditures by an unauthorized committee.
13

MR. BARAN;

14

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
But this would be an authorized

15 expenditure by an unauthorized committee.
16

MR. BARAN;

That is correct.

The terminology is

17 somewhat confusing and arcane, but one of the new
18 ingredients in the campaign financing laws introduced in
19 1971 was this notion of an authorized committee.
20

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

But if the committee

21 coordinates, if this so-called independent committee
22 coordinates, doesn't that affect its independent, alleged
23 independent status?
24

MR. BARAN;

Yes, Your Honor, but it would not make

25 that committee an authorized committee.

The statute very

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 clearly sets forth that an authorized committee is only that
2 committee that has been authorized in writing by the

3 candidate.

If there were these committees operating, and

4 they were doing so in coordination with the candidate, then
5 perhaps the candidate would have to come forth and authorize

6 them formally.

It's a formal process.

And this again is

7 the historical context in which Congress was confronting
8 this issue of campaign financing back, in 1971.
9

QUESTION*

Mr. Baran, was this argument made in

10 the three-judge court?
11

MR. BARAN*

12

QUESTION*

13

MR. BARAN;

14

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor.
And what happened to it?
The court rejected it.
Like the Election Commission does, did

15 this morning in any event.
16

MR. BARAN*

Yes, Your Honor, they did this

17 morning, and they have implicitly in their briefs, but
18 they've never promulgated a rule that sets forth as to the
19 scope of Section 9012(f) .

They have been unable even this

20 morning to tell you what's an expenditure to further the

21 election.
22

QUESTION*

Well, it may be, but they say that your

23 expenditures are reached by it anyway.

24

MR. BARANs

That’s pretty clear.

They say so. Your Honor.

We dispute

25 that.

QUESTION:

2

MR, BARAN*

Well, I understand; that much is clear
Yes, yes.

We wouldn't be here if they

3 didn’t say that.
4

QUESTION*

5

MR. BARAH:

69012(f)

Yes.
The history surrounding Section

I will only refer to briefly, but I wish to point

7 out to the Court’s attention that Senator Pastore, who is
8 the author of not only 9012(f) but the Fund Act, when
9 confronted with questions on the floor of the Senate as to
10 what would be the effect of the statute with respect to
11 certain committees organized by what he calls faculty
12 members of Columbia University or schoolteachers, he says,
13 you know, they’re operating on their own, they’re
14 independent, they’re able to do whatever they want to.
15

And this legislative history, in our opinion,

16 totally repudiates the contention of the Appellants that
17 Congress in enacting 9012(f) was seeking to control the
18 activities of genuinely independent organizations.
19

If Section 9012(f) were not construed as a

20 limitation on coordinated expenditures, then the statute
21 becomes unconstitutional as a restriction on First Amendment
22 rights of expression and association.

23
24 Buckley v.

Like Section 608(e) that this Court addressed in
Valeo, the restrictions contained here are

25 substantial, direct restrictions on both the quantity and

41
/
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the quality of political expression as undertaken in
2 conjunction with our campaigns.
3

Both Appellants this morning indicate that the

4 campaign funding act is important because the candidate has
5 made a decision to accept this public funding, and therefore
6 the expenditure limitation that is imposed on the candidate.
7

This Court recognized in Buckley, and it was so

8 recognized later in the Republican National Committee case,
9 that the overall general expenditure limitation that is
10 voluntarily assumed by the candidate who makes this election
11 is not a restriction on the rights of the candidate's
12 supporters where the supporters remain free to undertake
13 their own independent expression on behalf of that
14 candidate, so long as they do so outside of his campaign or
15 outside of his direction or control.
16

In Buckley the Court noted that a $1,000

17 limitation in 1975 was insufficient to purchase a
18 one-quarter page ad in the Washington Post newspaper here in
19 Washington.

That figure has doubled in terms of advertising

20 rates by 1979.

Whatever restriction occurred with respect

21 to the quantity of speech that could be purchased for
22 $1,000, it has doubled, more than doubled in the intervening
23 years since Buckley.
24

With respect to the quality of advocacy that can

25 be undertaken in light of Section 9012(f) as a restriction
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 on independent expression, the type of limitation that would
2 exist after the statute were construed to limit organized
3 collective political independent expression would mean that
4 there will be only four avenues of expression in conjunction
5 with publicly financed campaigns.

Those avenues would be

6 the campaign, the political parties, the institutional
7 press, and wealthy individuals.
8

It is conceded that if Senator Schmitt, who is an

9 appellee in this case, were a rich man and had the resources
10 to go out and purchase exactly the same advertising that
11 these committees undertook in 1980, that that would not only
12 not be reached by Section 9012(f), but that action on the
13 part of the individual is constitutionally protected, as it
14 was recognized by this Court in Buckley v. Valeo.
15

On the other hand, the committees have attempted

16 to gather together

persons of like mind who do not have the

17 unlimited resources that they

would be able to exercise

18 statutorily and constitutionally, and in lieu thereof have
19 chosen to pool their resources and to purchase expression

20 and to utilize professional help in terms of formulating
21 their message, and

to attempt to persuade the public as to

22 why it should vote

for Ronald Reagan in 1980.

And that is

23 the core of the expression that this Court has before it
24 today.
25

There is no question that the wealthy man can go
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 out and buy the same advertising, but the appellants think.
2 that it is not fair and constitutional to impose a
3 limitation on these groups and their supporters.
4

The interest that the appellants have advanced in

5 support of this restriction appears to be two;

first is the

6 interest of preserving the integrity of the public financing
7 statute.

As we indicate in our brief and as I just referred

8 to, we don't believe that is the interest that rises to the
9 area of being compelling, and that the statute first of all
10 was never contingent on an overall expenditure limitation;
11 and secondly, the only reason it was sustained in the
12 Republican National Committee case was that these supporters
13 still reserved their right to undertake independent
14 expression.
15

The other interest that has been advanced is the

16 proper interest and concern of Congress to prevent
17 corruption and the appearance of corruption with respect to
18 candidates after they become public office-holders.
19

This Court noted in Buckley that in the context of

20 independent expenditures, there is not the opportunity for
21 the contributor to sit down with the candidate or his
22 representative and
23 amount of money you

24

say okay, here's $50,000 or whatever
wish to denote.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAN W. BARAN, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES -- Continued

7

MR. BARAN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

8 it please the Court:
9

Up to the moment of our recess I was addressing

10 Section 9012(f) of the Fund Act, having previously concluded
11 the proper construction of the statute is that it does not
12 apply to the activities of the appellee committees.
QUESTION:

13

Could I ask you, I take it you think

14 there is no question that you can present this issue here.
15 You didn’t cross appeal, did you?
16

MR. BARAN:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BARAN:

No, Your Honor.

We did not.

And your argument was rejected below.
Yes.

It was addressed by the

19 three--judge court and rejected for the reasons stated in

20 their opinion, which in our brief we fully articulated were
21 not valid.
22

QUESTION:

But I take it if you won on the

23 statutory ground you wouldn't be expanding your relief
24 then.

It’s just that the Act couldn’t prevent these

25 expenditures.
46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. BARAN*

That is correct.

Our contention is

2 that the activities of these committees in 1980 were either
3 not regulated, or if there was an attempt at regulation
4 would be unconstitutional.

In either sense they should be

5 permitted to do what they did.
6

With respect to the First Amendment interests,

7 which Mr. Cox conceded are present in this case and which
8 this Court noted in Buckley and in the California Medical
9 Association case, are deserving of the highest protection
10 under the First Amendment.
11

The statute can be sustained only if it serves a

12 compelling governmental interest which is narrowly drawn and
13 cannot be accomplished through less restrictive measures.
14

In reviewing a similar statute in Buckley, Section

15608(e), which has been referred to many times earlier today,
16 this Court concluded that the one compelling interest or the
17 one governmental interest that was advanced in that case was
18 not served by —
19

QUESTION*

Justice Blackmun asked what a

20 compelling interest was.

What do you think it is?

Do you

21 think it's more than just an interest that is important
22 enough to outweigh any interests on the other side?
23

In that sense it would be compelling, in the sense

24 that it outweighs other interests?
25

MR. BARAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

It would

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 have to be compelling in the sense that it would offset the
2 First Amendment values.
3

QUESTION;

4

MR. BARAN:

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. BARAN;

7

QUESTION;

So it's just a balance.
It is a balance.
It means no more than a balance.
That is correct.
Nell, that’s just really a substitute

8 for any analysis, isn’t it?
9
10

MR. BARAN;
QUESTION;

I’m sorry, Your Honor.
That’s really just a substitute for any

11 analysis, to say that it meets or it doesn’t meet a
12 compelling interest.

It’s really the bottom line of the

13 decision of the Court, because it will be affirmed or
14 reversed depending on how the balance comes out.
15

MR. BARAN;

16

QUESTION;

That is correct, Your Honor.
So that’s really all it means is that

17 you ’re looking for — and all you’re submitting is that the
18 interests on the public side or in favor of the statute are
19 insufficient to justify the restriction.

20

MR. BARAN;

Yes, Justice White.

We do not contend

21 that the government does not have a valid interest in
22 preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in the
23 political process.

We argue that just as in the Buckley

24 case this limit does not serve that interest, and that there
25 are numerous other measures in the existing statutes of the
48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 campaign financing laws, some of which were enacted after
2 this Court's decision in Buckley, which more
3 constitutionally and more effectively address the interest
4 that the government had back originally in

'71 and in

5 subsequent years to prevent the corruption in campaign
6 financing.
7

The interest at all times has been focused on

8 contribution limits.

Senator Pastore referred to it as the

9 situation where there is the "intimate contact" between the
10 contributor and the candidate, which may create the
11 potential for undue influence or some sort of corrupt quid
12 pro quo.

And as this Court noted in Buckley, when one

13 refers to independent expenditures where an individual or a
14 group is undertaking their advocacy outside of the control
15 of the candidate, such an environment does not arise in the
16 sense that Congress was focusing on it when it was passing
17 these campaign financing laws.
18

The interest is served much better by other means

19 than a limit on the expression itself.

Some of those

20 measures which have been noted in the past include the
21 disclosure provisions.

Since the Buckley decision not only

22 have there been the continued disclosure provisions
23 requiring the disclosure of all receipts and all
24 disbursements, but after your decision the Congress enacted
25 in

'76 a further requirement that independent expenditures,
49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 specifically by these type of committees, have to be
2 separately reported.

And the Federal Election Commission

3 has promulgated even separate forms for the reporting of
4 independent expenditures.

And on top of that, on that

5 particular form the treasurer of the committee has to swear
6 that the expenditure was in fact independent.
7

QUESTION;

Well, don't you think the candidate

8 would know of that report and probably accord an audience,
9 if he would accord an audience to someone who contributed
10 directly?
11

MR. BARAN;

We do not dispute. Justice Rehnquist,

12 that the candidate may be aware of effective advocacy that
13 is undertaken on his behalf.

The issue that we believe is

14 crucial to the determination of the presence of a compelling
15 interest is whether this candidate has any control over this
16 advocacy in the sense that he would have control over
17 contributions that he receives;

and he spends those

18 contributions the way he and his campaign managers believe
19 ought to be

spent.

And the only way that he can get control

20 over that potentially under the corruption argument is by
21 making some sort of illicit promise in return for the
22 availability of the money.
23

But under these circumstances there is no dispute

24 that the committees in

their conduct in 1980 on behalf of

25 Ronald Reagan were not under his control.

They were

50

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTION:

HR. BARAN:

5

QUESTION:

Am I in error?
— And advocated their election.
I didn't think the argument on the

6 other side was that money was given as a result of a
7 promise, but that once the money was given there was a
8 collection time afterwards.
9

MR. BARAN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BARAN:

Isn't that their argument?

That is their argument, and —
Are you going to address that?
Yes, Your Honor.

Justice Marshall,

12 that argument is persuasive if, as you say, the money is
13 given, if the money is handed over to the candidate.
14

QUESTION:

Oh, I didn't

say that.

The money is

15 given just the way you say, and then afterwards they go by
16 and say remember me, I'm the one that gave you a million
17 dollars with no strings attached to it; and in the second
18 breath he says, "But I’d like a job."

That’s what they’re

19 talking about.
20

HR. BARANs

They may be discussing that situation,

21 but that situation has been addressed through contribution
22 limits, and

QUESTION:

It is not a problem.

MR. BARAN:No, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

It's not a problem

that people give

6 money in the hope of getting something for it.

That’s not a

7 problem.
8

MR. BARAN:

That is a problem.

We don’t believe

9 that that is present in this case, in this situation.
10

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn’t the question come down

11 to whether there is evidence of some such situation in order
12 to have that spill over on evaluating whether the committee
13 was truly independent or not?
14

Isn’t that an evidentiary question?

15

MR. BARAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

It’s an issue that’s

16 not before this Court as to whether these committees were in
17 fact independent.
18

They were sued.

QUESTION:

I thought the whole purpose of the Act

19 was you wouldn’t have to prove all these things.

20 that was the purpose of the Act.

I thought

Because if you gave money

21 and expected a return, and you were promised a return,
22 wouldn’t you violate more laws than this one?

Wouldn't you

23 violate laws long before this one?
24

MR. BARAN:

There are other statutes, as bribery

25 and graft statutes, yes.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

QUESTION:

So this law was passed to get to other

2 ways of getting to it, isn't it?
3

MR. BARAN;

Absolutely, Justice Marshall, without

4 restricting the First Amendment rights of expression and
5 advocacy and association that are clearly present under any
6 circumstances.
7

QUESTION:

There's no First Amendment right to buy

8 a job.
9

MR. BARAN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BARAN:

That is correct. Your Honor.
I'm glad we agree on that.
And that is not our contention or

12 factual issue here.
13

QUESTION:

Mr. Baran, do you agree with what I

14 understand to be the distinction drawn by counsel for
15 appellants between single issue groups and political
16 committees as defined in the Act?
17

In other words, may single issue groups, which now

18 are quite abundant in our country, can they be distinguished
19 from political committees as a practical matter?

20

MR. BARAN:

It is a very difficult distinction to

21 make which, as Mr. Steele indicated this morning, the
22 Commission grapples with those issues and on occasion has to
23 make an evaluation as to whether a particular organization
24 is an issue organization or whether it's a political

25 committee.
53

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The definitions under the Act

and I might say

2 that there are, I believe, three definitions in the campaign
3 financing laws — one in the Campaign Act, one in the Fund
4 Act, one in the Primary Act — are not even all in harmony.
5 They all say something a little differently, mostly because
6 they were all passed in different years.
7

QUESTION*

But do you agree that if there were no

8 question that an organization was an issue organization, do
9 you agree that Section (f) does not reach it?
✓

10

MR. BARAN;

Not at all, Your Honor.

In the

11 absence of a limited construction as to what constitutes an
12 expenditure to further the election of a candidate, it
13 clearly would encompass certain issue advocacy.

If these

14 committees had undertaken their advertising campaigns and
15 other expression in 1980 and simply said we think the SALT
16 II is a terrible idea and any President who adopts SALT II
17 should not be re-elected, they would still be covered by
18 9012(f).
19

QUESTION:

Yes, but, Mr. Baran, there are clearly

20 some single issue groups which would not be covered because
21 maybe both candidates take the same position as that group
22 does, or takes a contrary position, either way.

If you had

23 say an organization which supported membership in the United
24 Nations or whatever it might and both candidates agree that
25 is either good or bad, you surely wouldn’t call that a

QUESTION:

I wouldn't call that.

I —

There really isn't any danger that it

5 language either, is there?

HR. BARAN:

Well, Your Honor, I cited an advisory

7 opinion in this morning's argument issued by the Commission
8 that addressed the question of a loose association that
9 wanted to discuss issues on religious subjects, and how the
10 different candidates stood on those particular issues.

And

11 in 1980 there were three candidates receiving public funding.
12

The point we would make is that the term "further

13 the election" has not been narrowly construed by any party
14 here except us, and our construction is that Congress was
15 searching to limit coordinated expenditure activity.
16

QUESTION:

17 responses clear.

Let me see if I've got one of your

I'm not clear on it.

A group of people identified as bipartisan, both

19 Democrats, Republicans and

Independents, a mixed group, get

20 together an organize a committee, an anti-SALT II treaty
21 committee.
22

And you say that's a political action committee?
HR. BARAN:

I don't know, Your Honor.

I am saying

ME. BAEANs

The history of the Commission in

2 its construction of what constitutes a committee is very
3 broad; but I can say that if an organization were to make
4 identical expenditures regarding SALT II, and we all agree
5 that they're a political committee, then under appellants'
6 argument —

MR. BAEANs

Certainly.

12 one mind on SALT II, either for it or against it, and they

In my opinion it is not.

QUESTIONS

21

ME. BAEANs

If I did, I apologize for misspeaking.
Well, I may have misunderstood you.
I would suggest at the same time,

22 however , that the discussion of these type of issues, number
23 one , can be so inextricably combined with the current
24 campaign with inevitable references to candidates —

But I thought you would say that if

And that —
And even though they don’t name the

Which maybe tells us something about

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the ambiguities of the statute or the flaws in the statute
2 rather than in what the Commission has tried to do.
3

QUESTIONS

One doesn't have to name the candidate

4 to make it perfectly clear which of the two is being
5 supported.

For example, in the SALT II, the committee would

6 simply have to advocate rejection or adoption in the best
7 interest of the United States and never mention any
8 candidate, but the record of one or the other would tie
9 together.
10

I haven't read any of the rulings in this respect

11 by the Commission.
12

SR. BARAN:

How would it rule on something like that
I would prefer, Justice Powell, to

13 defer —
14

QUESTION;

15

MR. BARAN;

I've asked the wrong counsel.
— To the representative of the

16 Commission who I'm sure will be —
17

QUESTION;

Well, I'll reserve the question for Mr.

18 Steele.
19

MR. BARAN;

The less restrictive measures, in

20 addition to these reporting requirements that are contained
21 in the Act, also include requirements that if an independent
22 committee or even an individual undertook their independent
23 expenditure in the form of advertising, that the advertising
24 must clearly note who purchased that ad and the fact that it
25 was not authorized by any candidate.

And there is a

58

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 provision in the Federal Election Campaign Act that says
2 categorically that these committees could not take any of
3 the advertising or any of the materials produced by the
4 Reagan campaign and reproduce them.

The provision of the

5 Act says that that is a per se contribution and is no longer
6 independent.
7

So these restrictions which are contained in other

8 sections of the Campaign Act certainly are efforts on the
9 part of Congress to ensure that whatever independent
10 advocacy is undertaken is in fact independent, and that the
11 Commission will monitor those efforts.
12

QUESTIONi

Can the kind of a committee that you

13 represent, may the kind of committee you represent
14 contribute directly to the campaign of a candidate?
15

MR. BARAN:

No, Your Honor.

The Reagan campaign

16 was prohibited by law from accepting any contributions.
17

QUESTION:

18

MR. BARAN:

19 decision to

Because —
Because the candidate made a voluntary

accept the public funding, and the condition of

20 that acceptance on the candidate is that he cannot accept
21 any more contributions.
22

QUESTION:

23 alternative,

So you were speaking of some

less restrictive measures.

Is one of them a

24 limitation on the contribution to the kind of a committee
25 you represent?
59

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. BARAN

Yes, Your Honor

In addition to the

2 prohibition on contributions to the candidate, the
3 committees that I represent, all the funds they raise are
4 limited by the statute.

In fact, they're limited by the

5 provision that was upheld by this Court in California
6 Medical Association.

That contribution limit is the one

7 that is imposed on the supporters of these committees.
8

QUESTIONS

So your committee can't get more than

9 $5,000 from any one person.
10

MR. BARANs

That is correct, Your Honor.

From any

11 person.
12

QUESTION;

13

MR. BARANs

Any person.
Including another political committee

14 if one were to decide to support the activities of appellees.
15

For these reasons. Your Honors, we seek affirmance

16 of the unanimous three-judge court decision below.

17

If there are no further questions, I'm pleased to

18 conclude my argument.
19

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Very well.

20

Do you have anything further, Mr. Steele?

You

21 have two minutes remaining for your rebuttal.
22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES NEVETT STEELE, ESQ.,

23

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL

24
25 points;

MR. STEELE;

I would like to make, I think, two

one, with regard to the dangers that expenditures
60

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 pose.

I think that the suggestion here by the committees is

2 that expenditures do not pose such a danger.
3

I think that the Congress in this statute and in

4 similar statutes outside the Hatch Act and 441(b), which is
5 the prohibitions on corporations and labor organizations,
6 has explicitly made that judgment that expenditures present
7 the same kind of danger as contributions.
8

Secondly, I would like to emphasize something that

9 I said earlier, which is with regard to the ability of
10 individuals to engage in activity which is protected by the
11 Act, specifically with regard to the example that Justice
12 Rehnquist proposed of personal services; that the Act in
13 Section 431, the definitional section, the first statement
14 is that a contribution does not include such services.

In

15 other words, again, the Act in many places has made a
16 balancing between things which would be — certainly are
17 things of value to a campaign and certainly are

things that

18 the campaign may be very happy to have, but it's balance

19 that an individual has a right to do that kind of services,
20 again mentioning also in our brief the travel and the
21 housing.
22

If there are no further questions —

23

QUESTION;

24 the

25

I have one.

Let me have a variation of

hypothetical I gave to your friend.
Let’s suppose a group of people form a foreign
6 1

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 policy committee against Camp David agreements.

It’s

2 perfectly clear that that's identified with one of the
3 candidates, and it may be ambiguous as to the others who may
4 or may not have declared themselves.
5

In your view would the Act's, the provisions of

6 the Act, make that a political committee?
7

HR. STEELEi

It would seem to me that that is an

8 issue committee rather than a political committee.

I do not

9 think that the Commission had ruled on that; it has not been
10 asked that specific question.

It did have a case where the

11 allegation was made that Mobil Oil by making an expenditure
12 putting forth the position on what should happen to the
13 development of oil, that that was not — and in an area
14 where there were two candidacies, were Senate candidates,
15 but I think the principle holds true — that one candidate
16 was in favor of controlling the oil companies and one was
17 not, that that was not violating the prohibitions of the Act.
18

QUESTION;

That's not quite as sharp a distinction

19 as the foreign policy committee against Camp David
20 agreements.
21

MR. STEELE;

Yes.

I agree.

But I was saying that

22 in terms of places where I think the Commission has been.

23 would think that where you do not have the connection of an
24 issue to a vote explicitly that that is right at the
25 borderline.

I would say that where a committee is speaking
62

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I

1 only to issues and is not making the connection over the
2 candidates, I would think that was not necessarily a
3 political committee.

And I would think more prominently for

4 purposes of 9012(f) that you would not have a file — you
5 have the knowing and willfully furthering the election.

So

6 you would have to say that by coming out on an issue that
7 the committee was knowingly and willfully attempting to
8 further the election.

And I would think that, therefore,

9 there would be another element that would say that that
10 expenditure —
11

QUESTIONS

But if the Commission, hypothetically,

12 decided to proceed on that on the assumption that this was a
13 willful act, would you not have very grave First Amendment
14 problems with respect to these people trying to express
15 their views about a foreign policy matter?
16

SR. STEELEs

I think in some sense you do, and I

17 think that with regard to what Justice Marshall said
18 earlier, one of the things that this Act has attempted to
19 do,

and I think has done in 9012(f), is attempt to put a

20 barrier

so that you don't really have to look in to each

21 instance of a quid pro quo and make those kind of factual
22 investigations.
23

If the Commission were to have to make that kind

24 of determination, what Professor Cox referred to as looking
25 to see whether the intent was to further the election,

63

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

you

1 get into a very difficult area.

And I think to some extent

2 the statute has tried to make a prophylactic rule.
3

QUESTION:

Does that bring you up against some

4 possible substantive due process questions?
5

MR. STEELE:

6

QUESTION:

I could see -Cross petitions that rely on no

7 evidence but just on presumption, statutory, legislative
8 presumptions?
9

MR. STEELE:

I don’t see the problem in terms of

10 the way the statute has phrased it.

Again, there are some

11 limits to the English language in terms of the specificity,
12 and "to further the election" does not answer every
13 question, but it does seem to me a strong guide to what
14 Congress meant.
15

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen.

16

The case is submitted.

18 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
