PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

Compensation Programs.

Hr.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. GALIHER, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GALIHER;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

9 Court, the issue before you today in this case involves the
10 proper interpretation and application of Sections 2,
11 20 of

3 and

the Logshoremen and Harbor Workers Act as extended by

12 the D.C. Workers Compensation Act.

13

Specifically, the petitioners herein contend that

14 it was error of law for the lower court to use the Section
15 20 statutory presumption to presume an accidental injury
16 arising out of and in the course of employment on November
17 20th to the respondent Riley when he awoke in pain at home
18 with pain in his chest and arms.
19

By so doing, the lower court finding makes every

20 illness of any type encountered
21 Workers Compensation
22

QUESTION;

by an individual covered by

whether on or off the job.
Are you saying that all a worker need

23 do is to file a claim and then from that point on it is up
24 to the employer to rebut it?
25

MR. GALIHER;

Justice, I believe that that is what

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the presumption has been interpreted to be by the Riley
2 decision;

precisely.

The language of the presumption talks

3 about the term "claim;" that the claim be presumed within
4 the coverage of the Act.

And that is what the Riley

5 interpretation broadly interpreted can mean.
6 why

And this is

we have contested it to this Court.

7

QUESTION;

How could one more narrowly interpret

8 it?

9

MR. GALIHER;

10 presently have taken

Well, the circuit courts of appeals

the position that the presumption

11 should be applied only when there has been an accident which
12 occurred in

the course of employment; in the course of

13 employment being in a space and time relative to the
14 employment relationship.
15

In this particular instance, the court has simply

16 taken a finding, made a finding that the term "injury" means
17 pain, and then gone on to say that the presumption can be
18 applied because a worker has pain, to relate that pain to
19 something in the employment activity.
It is our position that this case is governed by

20
21 Section

903 of the statute quoted on page 3 of the brief,

22 and it states as follows;

Compensation shall be payable

23 under this chapter in respect of disability or death of an
24 employee; but only if the disability or death results from
25 an injury.
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Under this statute, injury is specifically defined

2 in Section 2, Subsection (2) of the Act as an accidental
3 injury or death arising out of and in the course of
4 employment.

The terms "arising out of", "accidental

5 injury", "in the course of employment" have been construed
6 by court decisions.

It is our position that the burden of

7 proof of the respondent Riley in this claim starts with the
8 Section 903 language that he must be an employee in order to
9 achieve the status for making the claim in the first place,
10 and secondly, that his claim must arise out of in the course
11 of employment.
12

"Arising out of" has been determined under this

13 Act to mean that there is a causal relationship between the
14 employment or the work that the employee was doing and his
15 injury.

The language "in the course of" has been determined

16 to mean that the injury must occur at a time and place
17 relative to employment activities being performed.

18

QUESTION;

When you say "has been determined" do

19 you mean by this Court?
20

MR. GALIHER;

No.

No.

This Court in its

21 decisions, as I have read them, has never come to a
22determination of some of the issues which are raised in this
23 case.

This Court has never separately defined the meaning

24 of "arising out of" and "in the course of employment" in the
25 context of a worker’s compensation statute, under the

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Longshoremen and Harbor Workers Act cases.
2

In this particular instance, when we have the

3 language of the definition of injury providing a base for
4 compensation, it is our contention that the statutory
5 presumption cannot be used as it was in this case.

I would

6 point out to this Court that the lower court found that
7 despite the administrative law judge who tried the case and
8 who heard the evidence and who found that there was no
9 injury suffered by the employee at work on November 19,

1975

10 when he alleged an injury at work at 2*30 or 3*00 o'clock in
11 the afternoon, this court in reviewing these facts did not
12 disturb the finding made by the administrative law judge,
13 did not say that that was not supported by substantial
14 evidence.
15

What the court, in fact, did, however, was find a

16 new injury.

The new injury -- and they used the term

17"injury" in a statutory meaning which we contend is
18 incorrect — was found at 2:30 in the morning when Mr. Riley
19 awoke in pain and was rushed to the hospital.

That is the

20 injury that the lower court found.
21

Having made such a finding of injury in that case,

22 then the lower court went on, bearing in mind you have these
23 elements; accidental injury, arising out of, and in the

24 course of, the court went on to then go to the "arising out
25 of" part of

the statute.

The court went and took a look at
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the presumption and said we have never failed to apply the
2 presumption to any case in this circuit.

So we are going to

3 apply the presumption here, and the effect of that
4 presumption is to change the burden of proof in this case.
5 We are going to put the burden of proof over on the
6 employer , and we are going to let the employer explain how
7 this man or why this man turned up with an injury at 2s30 in
8 the morning.
9

QUESTION i

Well why, under the reasoning of the

10 court of appeals, would you even need an injury, if they
11 apply the presumption that the claim comes within the
12 provision of this chapter?

Wouldn't that presumption be

13 all-encompassing under their reasoning?

And the simple

14 filing of the claim bring with it the presumption that the
15 claim comes within the provision of the chapter?
16

MR. GALIHER:

Broadly interpreted, as the D.C.

17 Circuit did in this case, that is a correct statement of
18 what they say the law should be.

We contend that that is

19 not what the law is; that that is not what the legislative

20 history — little of it thought it may be under this Act
21 pertaining to this question -- we contend that that is not
22 what the intention of the drafters of this statute had in
23 mind when they used this language in the statute to define
24 injury.

And even despite the language in the statute

25 dealing with the statutory presumption.

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The statutory presumption is taken word for word

2 from the New York Act.

When the legislative history and

3 congressional testimony was taken in this case, there was
4 discussion initially concerning whether or not there should
5 be an accidental injury or merely an injury; then there was
6 discussion as to whether it should be arising out or in the
7 course of employment or arising out of and in the course of
8 employment.
9

We have pointed out to this Court in our brief

10 that the term "arising out of and in the course of
11 employment" appears in the state statutes of 42 states.

The

12 term "accidental injury, arising out of and in the course of
13 employment" appears in the state statutes of 30 states.

But

14 when we come to the presumption, the presumption only
15 appears in a total of four states, one of which is New York,

16 one of which being New York this Act embodied the New York
17 Act.

The language of Section 21 of the New York Act is, in

18 fact, our statutory presumption in Section 20 of the Act.
19 And the "arising out of and in the course of employment" as
20 a result of the conference committee was construed to be the
21 proper definition of injury under this Act.

22

New York decisional law, construing this Act,

23 indicated that the language of the presumption could not be
24 applied the way the D.C. Circuit has done here.

The

25 language of the presumption in the New York cases prior to

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the enactment of this Act cited in our brief and cited in
2 the amicus brief make it clear that you must show some

3 facts, you must show some incident arising in the course of
4 employment in order for the statutory presumption to be
5 considered.
QUESTION;

6

7 a second?

Hr. Galiher, could I interrupt you for

On this case we have sort of two different

8 theories on

which the claimant might have recovered; one,

9 that he had an accident the night before where he hurt
10 himself;

or alternatively, that he had an arthritic

11 condition that was aggravated by long employment with this
12 company,

which is the theory I guess the court of appeals

13 consideres acceptable.
14

Is it your view that he had originally filed a

15 claim in which he said, I woke up at 2;30 a.m. with a very
16 bad back, which I now claim was aggravated by -- I had
17 arthritis for years and it's an aggravated situation, and
18 that claim is compensable under the statute.

Though he

19 could still not recover.
20
21 that

22

MR. GALIHER;

No.

Ky position in that regard is

the burden of proof is that he must —
QUESTION;

Would it be then called a statutory

23 presumption — that's the question, I guess.
24

MR. GALIHER;

25 presumption, Justice.

Well, this relates to statutory
It is my position that the employee,

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 under that set of circumstances, is not foreclosed from
2 proving an injury, from proving these elements, proving
3 accidental injury arising out of and in the course of.
4

QUESTION:

Well, what does he have to prove?

You

5 say he proves that he had arthritis a long time and he woke
6 up in the morning with a very bad — with these pains.
7

MR. GALIHER:

Well, it is our contention that he

8 would have to come in with medical opinion indicating that
9 there is a cause and effect relationship between his work
10 duties -11

QUESTION;

Then what function does the statutory

12 presumption play?
13

MR. GALIHER;

We look at the statutory presumption

14 in terms of the broad general purpose of this Act.

It's a

15 remedial act for employees within the scope of their
16 employment who suffer injuries.

The purpose of this

17 presumption is to assist the claimant in making his case if
18 he cannot prove it otherwise.
19

However, the presumption, in our view, does not

20 apply until the employee shows himself within the initial
21 elements of injury, and that particularly with reference to

22"in the scope of employment."
23

QUESTION;

If he wakes up at —

But you just said it wouldn't apply in

24 the example I gave you to show causal connection.

It seems

25 to me you’re saying he must prove a prima facie case before

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 he gets the benefit of the statutory presumption.
2

MR. GALIHER;

I am saying that.

I am saying that

3 because that is the way I interpret the definition of injury
4 under the statute, and that is the way I believe the New
5 York cases,

which would embody -- be embodied in the

6 legislative history of this Act have also indicated the fact
7 to be.
8

QUESTION;

So really,

the law would be the same if

9 that section were not in the statute, because every
10 plaintiff has the burden of proving a prima facie case,

I

11 suppose.
12

MR. GALIHER*

Well, that's correct, but the case

13 law also indicates a little bit more in this instance.
14 First of all, the case law indicates that the Act is to be
15 liberally construed in favor of workers.

Secondly,

there is

16a mandate from court decisions that indicates in the case of
17 doubt that the employee is to be given the benefit of the
18 doubt with respect to his proof on any claim.
19

What I'm talking about with reference to the

20 statutory presumption is simply that you have to start with

21 the working relationship; you have to start within
22 employment, and that you cannot make a claim or prove a
23 claim solely by the use of this presumption.

That precisely

24 is what the court did below; the court having found that
25 November 20 rather than November 19th was the crucial date.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Then the court below went on to say that it was the
2 employer's burden.
3

QUESTION;

Mr. Galiher, do you think that the

4 presumption is, in itself, evidence that the administrative
5 law judge says, I flatly disbelieve this claimant in his
6 statement that he’s suffered an injury; that nonetheless,
7 the presumption could be used in favor of the claimant, so

2 my petition, I think that that would be enough to trigger
3 the presumption.
4

Clearly, he would —

QUESTION;

It clearly would have in this circuit,

5 but -6

MS. GALIHER;

His onset was within the scope of

7 his employment, and with that onset having occurred -8 occurring within the scope of the employment, the majority
9 of circuits below take the position that there is a
10 presumption that arises to assist the claimant in proving
11 the causal relationship.
12

With respect to Justice Rehnquist's question,

13 though, there's a case called Kwaisur in the Third Circuit
14 which I cited in my brief, and in that case there was very

15 clear language indicating that even if an injury occurred in
16 the course of employment, in the scope of employment on the
17 job, that the administrative law judge, upon hearing this
18 testimony, was not bound by the presumption.

He could still

19 make the credibility finding and reject the claim.

20
21 evidence.

What I am asserting here is that there must be
You start with evidence, not simply the filing of

22a claim, a piece of paper, and then come in on the
23presumption.

Because the logical ending of this type of a

24 decision is that the common cold will be covered if an
25 employee goes home and is in good health and the next
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 morning wakes up with a cold.

Under this decision because

2 he went to the doctor and was treated he can file a claim,
3 and as pointed out by the amicus in their brief, he can put
4 the employer to the test and say that this statutory
5 presumption compels a finding prima facie that there was a
6 relationship between my employment activities the preceding
7 day and my cold the next day.
8

This is where the decision of the lower court does

9 not make sense.

The decision of the lower court makes a

10 finding, a presumed finding, that whatever happened to cause
11 the pain, wherever the pain arose, was, in fact, from the
12 employment relationship.

And this is a finding that we

13 contend is not supported by any of the cases, except those
14 cases where you have the initial pain or complaint within
15 the time and framework of the employment.
16
17 this.

We are contending that the employee can prove
He can come in -- we contend it's their burden for

18 the employee to come in and prove that there's a
19 relationship between the pain off the job and something in
20 the employment relationship.

And under those circuit

21 decisions that hold that the presumption exists because that
22 pain occurred in the course of employment, we hold that this
23 would indulge the operation of the presumption.

24

The problem with the lower circuit case here is

25 that this makes the employer an insuror of the safety of the
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 employee at

all times, becausethat presumption is

going to

2 come in and

operate to relate that harm or pain to the

3 employment relationship.
4

In short, --

5

QUESTION;

6 question.

Mr. Galiher, let me ask just one other

Supposing in this case he gets on the — he makes

7 his claim, he gets on the stand and says I woke up in the
8 morning with these pains and I worked there for X number of
9 years, and this is the nature of my work.
10 I do all this.

I life things and

And he gets a doctor to get on the stand who

11 says, given

that set of facts, it's my opinion that this

12 pain in the

morning could have been the result of

13 aggravation of his arthritic condition.

Now, the burden

14 would then shift to the employer, wouldn't it, to disprove
15 that, or would you say that's still not enough?
16

MR. GALIHER;

Well, if he woke up and his first

17 pain was in the morning?
18

QUESTION;

Two-thirty a.m., just as you have here.

19

MR. GALIHER;

Not on the job.

I would say that

20 the burden is on the employee in that instance, in the first

21 instance.
22

QUESTION;

The employee.

23

MR. GALIHER;

24

QUESTION;

Yes.

But say he gets on the stand, he says I

25 work there -- you know, he just says the facts that are

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 right obvious on the surface of the case.

And he has a

2 doctor say that given those facts, it's my opinion that it’s
3 possible that the pain in the morning was the result of
4 aggravation of his arthritis.

Has he made out a case that

5 shifts the burden?
6

MR. GALIHER;

7

QUESTION;

I think he does at that point, yes.

Then what are we -- isn’t that all

8 that’s going to happen here?
9
10

MR. GALIHER;
QUESTION;

No.

I mean, we’re going to have a trial now

11 and then somebody is going to decide whether that’s right or
12 wrong.
13

MR. GALIHER;

What’s going to happen here on

14 remand is this case is going to go back with the employee
15 being told that he doesn't have to come in with any
l6additional evidence.
17

QUESTION;

Yes, but you know he’s going to put a

18 doctor on the stand.I don’t think there's much doubt about

19 that, is there?
20

MR. GALIHER;

Well, reading the Riley decision

21 from the D.C. Circuit, he doesn't have to do anything.

22

QUESTION;

All right, but if you put a doctor on

23 the stand who says this couldn’t have happened, then you're
24 going to win.

25

MR. GALIHER;

That’s correct.

If we put the

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 doctor on the stand and if the presumption were compelled to
2 apply in that situation, Del Vecchio would say that the
3 burden comes back to the employee, and then he's going to
4 have to show something else.
5

What we're talking about here is where the burden

6 starts and the D.C. Circuit says that the burden starts with
7 the employer, not the employee.
8

QUESTION;

The question really is who has to put

9 the first doctor on the stand.
10

HR. GALIHER:

That's correct.

11

We see this case as a case involving a further

12 erosion by the circuit courts of what started out with the
13

New York decisions to be the use of the statutory

14

presumption to favor the claimant only when he had put on

15 his initial burden of proof.

The circuit courts of appeals

16

now have taken the position that if you have an injury in

17

the course of employment, that this presumption

18

automatically arises, to give the employee the edge up.

19

Now, the employer still has a right in those

20

circumstances to bring in evidence to try to rebut the

21

presumption.

22

that the presumption starts the whole thing.

23

employee puts on any proof, the presumption is there for the

24

employee to rely on because he filed his claim.

25

But what the lower court decision says here is
Before the

We would point out that the statutory presumption
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 uses the term "claim"; it doesn't say "accidental injury",
2 it doesn't say "arising out of", it doesn't even say
3"jurisdiction”, although this Court in its previous
4 decisions has used the presumption without making a specific
5 finding; has affirmed findings of deputy commissioners who
6 have found jurisdiction and have mentioned this statutory
7 presumption along the way.
8

In the Caputo case that was cited in one of the

9 briefs, the lower court mentioned specifically that there
p
10 was no presumption
of jurisdiction.

When this court made

11 its find
finding in that case, there was no mention of the
12 sta

presumption.

This court made its finding based

13 upon the evidence to determine what did the evidence show
regard to the status and situs of the employees under

What we are asserting here is that a similar

QUESTION;

You just have no faith in the jury

23

MR. GALIHER;

Well, it's not a jury. Justice, it

24 is an administrative law judge who tries this case.

The

25judge can make a finding, as we've cited in some of the

The judge is free to reject

2 or accept the opinion --

3

QUESTION:

Well, there's no way we can control the

4 administrative judge.

If he wants to do the things you're

5 talking about.
NR. GALIHERi

6

Well, the administrative law judge,

7 under the decisions, is free to accept or reject the
8 testimony of any physician, as well as the claimant under

9 this.

If he finds that he wants to believe the employee

10 that he had
11

12

an injury on the job, then having heard that

testimony, he can make a finding in favor of the employee.
QUESTION;

So you just don’t want to go before the

13 administrative judge.
14

MR. GALIHER:

I don't want to go back before the

15 administrative law judge with this presumption as it has
16 been interpreted by the lower court to give the employee
17 24-hour a day coverage.

I don't want to go back under those

18 circumstances.
19

Now, we've indicated here that the interpretation

20 placed upon this statute by the
21

never meant to be.

lower court, we contend, was

It cannot be justified on the basis of

22 the legislative history of

this Act, or on the basis of

23 prior judicial interpretation.

Riley is the first case to

24 come down, and using the definition of injury, accidental
25 injury arising out of and in the course of employment, to

1 come and say that "in the course of employment" will he
2 presumed.

Not only do you have decisions now that say that

3 accidental injury shall be presumed; you have decisions that
4 say "arising out of" will be presumed.

This makes a

5 presumption of coverage for everybody, whether they're an
6 employee or not.

The crucial thing under this decision, all

7 the employee has to do is file his claim, and then the
8 burden shifts to the employer.
9

So it’s our contention that the administrative law

10 judge, under the Cardillo case which we cited in the
11 appendix to our brief, had the right to make a choice in
12 this case, and that his choice based upon the evidence,
13 considering this broad statutory terms, should not be
14 disturbed; that there is a narrow scope of review to which
15 the employee is entitled to.
16

In this case, contrary to most of the cases you

17 will read cited, the employer won.

Host of those cases were

18 cases -- the other cases cited were cases where the employee
19 lost and then the burden was placed upon the employer to
20 come in and show that there was not substantial evidence.
21 In this case we contend that there was substantial
22 evidence.

We contend that Riley should not be presumed to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. GREEN, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

7

MR. GREEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

8 the Court, the question before this Court today is not
9 whether Ralph Riley is entitled to workers' compensation,
10 but whether his claim shall be afforded the scrutiny which
11 Congress intended and which the court below would require.
12

If the proof of a job-related injury entails the

13 proof of a specific accident, then virtually no occupational
14 disease would be compensable, nor could any gradual
15 aggravation of an ailment by a person's work be compensable.
16

The court below has once again held that the

17 potential work-relatedness of injuries must be explored.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Green, on page 15a of the petition,

19 which is the court of appeals’

opinion at the bottom

20 paragraph the court says, "From these facts, the
21 administrative law

judge inferred that the story of an

22 accident was not constructed until claimant's release from
23 the hospital on November 25th,
24 differing account of the act

1975, and that claimant's

’renders unbelievable his

25 testimony as to the happenings of any accident.'

The court of appeals went on and reversed that
Now, what is going to happen when this case goes

4 back to tha administrative law judge?
5

HR. GREEN;

When this case goes back, as we hope

6 it would, to the administrative law judge with a Section 28
7 presumption intact, the judge will be required, as the court
8 of appeals demanded of him and of the administrative body,
9 to review this injury with regard to whether or not not just
10a specific accident did or did not occur, but whether or not
11 the man's work in any way contributed to his present
12 infirmity, which the judge found as an uncontested fact that
13 he was so disabled as a result of an event, but not the
14 injury that he testified to.
15

That's -- all the presumption would do in this

16 instance, as I would see it. Justice Rehnquist, is to

17 require the administrative body to review the definition of
18 injury under its own act and to see whether or not this
19 history in any way comes within the ambit of Section 2(2).

20

QUESTION;

Would it require the administrative

21 hearing examiner to believe what he has already found was
22 unbelievable?
23

HR. GREEN;

24 precisely the point.

Not at all, Mr. Chief Justice, that's
All it demands of him is that he

25 answer the entire question before him, not just part of the

The whole question being is there an injury

Not to get into what he found.

It

3 does not require him to disbelieve any facts he found; that
4 is undisturbed by the court of appeals' opinion.
5

QUESTION;

6 administrative law

Well, the only claim before the
judge with respect to an injury was an

7 injury on the job, wasn't it?
8

MR. GREEN;

9

QUESTION;

It was, Justice White, yes.
And the court of appeals said well, we

10 won't disturb the finding that

but we say there was nevertheless an injury which

12 occurred in

such an injury didn't take

the middle of the night.

SR. GREEN;

The court of appeals observed that the

14 judge, the administrative law judge, had found an injury in
15 the course of the evening.
16

QUESTION;

But it wasn't the injury that the

17 claimant had put forward.
18

MR. GREEN ;

It was not the accident at work that

19 the claimant put fo rward, but it may very well still be an

QUESTION;

Well, that isn’t my question.

My

4 question is is there anything improper about the court of
5 appeals substituting another — in imposing an injury other
6 than what the claimant had put forth before the
7 administrative law judge.
8

ME. GREEN*

Justice White, I don’t believe that

9 there was anything improper with the court of appeals making
10 the observation that the judge had found such an event and
11 was frustrated in its ability to deal with that fact in the
12 record that the same administrative law judge found.
13 Because the administrative law judge, having found the fact,
14 never addressed it.
15

Therefore, the court of appeals, in our opinion

16 and we would urge was correct.

17

QUESTION*

Well, it had never been claimed as an

18 injury.
19

MR. GREEN*

20

QUESTION*

That's correct, sir.
Well, do you think they should fault

21 the administative law judge for that — practice law for the
22 claimant ?
23

MR. GREEN*

No, I don't think that they should

24 practice law for the claimant, but I think they're required
25 to examine the administrative record and the administrative

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 requirements for review, consistent with the court’s
2 interpretation of the Section 28 presumption.

Having done

3 that, I think they were required to remand the case.
4

QUESTION

Well given the language of the 28

5 presumption and its breadth, which simply says that the
6 filing of any claim under this act entails a presumption
7 that it is covered, is it enough for a workman to simply
8 file a claim saying that he was injured while in the employe
9 of X company, and then say okay, X company, come on in and
10 show that what I'm saying in my claim isn't true?
11

KB. GREEN;

As I understand the requirements of

12 the Section 20 presumption, that is correct.

Once the claim

13 is asserted, the presumption does not have the force, as
14 this Court has held in Del Vecchio, Justice Roberts for the
15 Court, does not have the force of affirmative evidence, but
16 does nevertheless require the rebuttal of its existence
17 through some substantial evidence, as the Court defines
18 substantial evidence in that particular decision dealing
19

20

with Section 20(a), sub (d) of the presumptive Section 20.
QUESTION;

So even if the claimant files against

21 employer X, employer X may have to come in and show by FICA
22

records or something like that the claimant has never worked

23 for this particular employer.
24
25

MR. GREEN;

Certainly, the employer -- if a claim

is filed, it would require the acceptance of the claim by
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the employer or its rebuttal by the employer once
2 initiated.

The law does require that.

And in this

3 instance, I believe this decision is consistent with that
4 requirement.

Section 20 does not give affirmative evidence

5 to the claimant; simply requiring that the claim comes
6 within the provisions of the act.

The employer is then

7 free, through substantial evidence which can be general
8 negative evidence,

9

to rebut that claim.

If a claimant comes forward with no evidence, I am

10 confident that the claim is going to be rebutted.
11

QUESTION*

12

MR. GREER*

But it doesn't have to be.
No, the employer can prove nothing.

13 The employer can not submit any evidence, can not challenge
14 the claim, can choose not to voluntarily accept it and let
15 the administrative body rule on the claim as made.
16

QUESTION*

And in that case, the administrative

17 body must accept the claim.
MR. GREEN*

18

It would be my understanding that the

19 administrative body would accept the claim in the absence of
20 any
21

rebuttal, assuming that -- in the absence of any

rebuttal or any evidence from the employer, the

22 administrative body

is presented with a prima facie case.

23 There is nothing they can but accept the claim.
24

QUESTION*

The presumption says it's presumed to

25 be within the act.

about when, where or why, he would say no, indeed; I just

QUESTION:

In other words, if he'd been skiing in

MR. GREEN:

Not just job-related, but whether or

9 not there was coverage in the Alps.

The employer is going

10 to do a number of things with such a claim.
11

Justice Powell, I think the employer would be

12 quite competent to rebut such an assertion by a claim.

QUESTION:

Did you say he would have to —

14 otherwise, his heart attack or his broken leg -15

MR. GREEN:

16Vecchio, yes.

As I understand the decision in Del

As long as the Section 20 presumption

17 proceeds in any claim, any proceeding under this law and
18 covers any provision of a claim, then it can be rebutted by

igthe most negative evidence, the most minute evidence, but it
20 must be rebutted.

And if the employer does nothing, then

21 the presumption carries.

Such has been the announcement of

22 this Court in Del Vecchio.

QUESTION;

Why is it different in your view from

8

MR. GREEN;

It is different here, Mr. Chief

9 Justice, because Congress has given us, as this Court said
10 in Del Vecchio — we are constrained to work within the
11 statutory framework; we cannot consider the common law
12 questions that arise in such a fact setting.

And that's why

13 1 would suggest, sir, that it would be different.

QUESTION;

In other words, a legislative body, you

15 are saying, could not superimpose this kind of a presumption
16on the common law claims of any kind.

MR. GREENi

Yes, sir.
And if that form of claim on its face

a compensable claim under the statute, is it your

11 claim?
12

MR. GREEN:

My position, Justice Brennan, would be

13 that it does fall to the employer -14

QUESTION:

I just want to get this clear.

Then I

I5gather all that the employee has to do is to write out on
16the form a claim that falls within the statute, and then he
17has no further burden to prove anything.

Is that right?

11

QUESTION:

12for a moment.

Mr. Green, may I go back to the statute

Section 20 says that in any proceeding for

13 the enforcement of a claim for compensation and so forth,
14 that the presumption is that the claim comes within the
15 provisions of the chapter.

On page 80 of the appendix,

16which is claimant's exhibit 2, which I take it is the claim
17 in this case, wherein which you gave notice to the company

l8of the basis of your claim.

The claim was that you were

19 injured on November 19th — your client was injured on
20 November

21

19th while working at Walter Reed Hospital.
So the presumption applied to that claim.

Was

22 there ever a claim made that's consistent with the theory of
23 the court of appeals to which the presumption would apply?

24

MR. GREEN:

QUESTION;

It may not definition of injury, but

13 the presumption doesn't apply to injuries; it applies to

9 have to go ahead and make a finding as to whether that was

11

MR. GREEN:

In the specific instances of this

12 action, any work-related employment-bred injury or

15 his findings, but never addresses it.

Yes, sir.
So you say the claim ought to be

14 conformed to the proof.
15 saying?

Is that it?

Is that essentially what you're

Because surely, there's never been a claim filed

16 with respect to the injury that is now that the court of
17 appeals found.
18

HR. GREEN:

Justice White, we are suggesting that

19 the claim provision of the law encompasses that finding by
20 the administrative law judge.

The distinction is that he

21 concentrates on the incident and not the injury, and because
22 he confuses those definitions of no incident, he does not
23 then address what else he finds, which is the fact of injury

24 which he finds.
25

QUESTION;

What is a claim in the technical sense
36

1 of the word?
2

MR. GREENf

As I would understand it, Justice

3 Rehnquist, a claim is an assertion that an injury comes
4 within the coverage of the Longshoremen's Act, that it is an
5 injury arising in and out of the course of employment, and
6 that such injury is occasioned by such employment
7 relatedness.
8

QUESTION;

Did it specify what kind of injury it

9 was?
10

MR. GREEN;

11

QUESTION;

No, sir.

The claim does not, sir.

Well, your letter, which is Exhibit A,

121 gather, signed by you, Mr. Green, addressed the office of
13 the Workmen's Compensation Programs, identified what you
14 were filing as original and two copies of "our claim form,
15 to be filed on behalf of our client Riley", and your claim
16form, I gather, was Exhibit 2, isn't that right?
17

MR. GREEN;

18

QUESTION;

That's correct, Justice Brennan.
And there's no reference anywhere to

19 anything except this accident lifting ductwork weighing
20approximately 500 pounds.
21

MR. GREEN;

That's correct. Justice Brennan, there

22 is no such reference because that is the theory upon which
23 we proceeded.

24

That an incident --

QUESTION;

Well, who put in all this other

25 evidence about other causation for the injury?

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. GREEN:

It was a matter of the testimony in

2 the case, and the judge so found that there was such injury
3 at home from cervical osteo-arthritis found in this matter
4 of fact.

And then he never addressed whether or not that

5 was related to the employment situation.
6

QUESTION;

Are you telling us then that the court

7 of appeals treated the claim that was filed, not just that
8 which is Exhibit 2, but really to find out what the claimed
9 filed was, looked at the complete record before the
10 administrative law judge?
11

MR. GREEN:

It did, Justice Brennan, and put that

12 record in juxtaposition to the administrative proceeding.
13

QUESTION:

Has there ever been any other claim

14 filed up until this moment?
15

MR. GREEN:

No, sir, there is none because under

16 the requirements of the statute you do not file another
17 claim or amend the claim under Section 922 until there is a
18 final proceeding or a finding by a court.
19

QUESTION:

20

MR. GREEN;

21

QUESTION;

So you did not.
No, sir, nor can we.
Well, I’m still troubled as to how we

22 can uphold that claim.

You do not.

Nor did the court of

23

MR. GREEN;

24 appeals.

They did not uphold tha t claim.

25

QUESTION;

They agreed

Well, if your claim is not upheld,
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 you or do you not lose?
2

MR. GREEN;

If our claim is not upheld, we do not

3 win, Justice Marshall.
4

QUESTION;

5

MR. GREEN;

However, our claim in this --

Well then how do you win?
Our claim in this instance is more

6 than the incident at work.

And all we are suggesting is

7 what the court of appeals did; that by finding -- and they
8 did not disturb the finding — that there was no incident at
9 work.

What they said is you've also found evidence of

10 injury, you find it uncontradicted in the record, and you
11 don't tell us whether or not that is employment bred, and
12 you are required to do that by the Section 28 presumption.
13 When they read the judge's decision, they find that he did
14 not even apply the Section 28 presumption to the facts that
15he found.
16

QUESTION;

How do you frame the claim that was

17 upheld?
18

MR. GREEN;

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. GREEN;

There was no claim —
In words, how do you frame it?
Justice Marshall, there has been no

21 claim.
22

QUESTION;

I have great difficulty in affirming

23something that I don't know what I'm affirming.

That's why

24 you have the pleadings in common law, and you have pleadings
25here, don't you?

You had to file a claim.

MR. GREEN;

2

QUESTION ;

3

MR. GREEN;

4

Not in the sense of common law —
Well, why did you file a claim?
Because the man asserted an injury at

work.
QUESTION;

5

To get a case started.

Because you

6 couldn *t move without that claim, could you?
7

MR. GREEN;

8

QUESTION;

That's correct, sir.
And I would be unfair in saying you

That would be wrong,

wouldn’t it?

addresses the

incident of injury and not the fact of injury

in the course of employment.

But all

No, sir, I think I need a claim to

we are suggesting here is that the claim is

QUESTION;

The statute requires more

He finds two problems, the fact

It may be, Mr. Green, that it might

petition for certiorari.

But the court of appeals'

22 was not attacked on this ground.

24
25

judgment

Of course, we can notice

clean air coming from that federal court, I suppose.
MR. GREEN;
what you're saying.

Justice White, I understand exactly
I'm suggesting that the court of
40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 appeals does not, in any way, suggest what the finding of
2 the administrative law judge should be; it only requires the
3 administrative judge to answer the question, which may very
4 well be in the negative.

But it does not anticipate his

5 finding.
6

QUESTION;

It is a new claim.

7 wouldn't have to have a new trial.

Otherwise, you

This certainly is a

8 different claim than you filed before.
9

HR. GREEN:

It is not a different claim. Justice

10 White, in the sense of claim under the act.
11

QUESTION:

No one at the trial said well, this man

12 has arthritis; is it work related.

There wasn't a question

13 at all.
14

MR. GREEN:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. GREEN;

17

QUESTION:

But the judge found and -That he had arthritis.
Yes.
All right.

But no one addressed

18 whether it was work related.
19

QUESTION;

I gather that was a happy accident,

20 then, wasn't it, Mr. Green, for your client that the

21 administrative law judge should have taken this evidence on
22 not as to the weightlifing but all this other stuff and
23 spread it on the record.

That, you're suggesting, required

24 the court of appeals then to say well,

the presumption

25 applies to that record made before the administrative law

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 judge, and the administrative law judge didn't complete his
2 job, so send it back, to do it.
3

MR. GREENs

4

QUESTION;

Yes, Justice Brennan, that's correct.
And yet, if none of that had gotten on

5 in the record before the administrative law judge, nothing
6 except the evidence as to the lifting of the weights, you
7 wouldn't be here, would you?
8

MR. GREENs

That's correct, sir.

I would have to

9 be back with a Section 922 request for modification of the
10 original hearing as opposed to going forward through the
11 courts of appeals to have this issue resolved.

It could

12 have been done administratively under Section 922.
13

QUESTIONS

Incidentally, has the court of appeals

14 addressed this issue before this case?
15

MR. GREENs

The court of appeals?

Yes.

All

16 courts of appeals, in contra-distinction to my brother, have
17 addressed this issue, and

I would hold again, in

18 contra-distinction to my brother, that all courts of appeals
19have answered the question in the affirmative, as the
20 District of

21

QUESTION*

22 deliberately

23

Columbia Court of Appeals has done so.
Is that on the ground that the statutes

construed in favor of --

MR. GREEN*

Among others, yes, Justice Brennan.

24 And I would suggest that there is a unanimity among the
25 circuits, as opposed

to other assertions in this record.
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I

1 believe the case law, of course, will speak for itself as to
2 their positions on Section 928 presumption.
3

fill we are asking for is the administrative law

4 judge to answer the question under 920.

If he answers the

5 question either affirmatively or negatively, the case has
6 come to rest.

That is the request that we have made.

As we

7 said at the opening, the question before this Court today is
8 not whether Ralph Riley is entitled to workmen's
9 compensation, but whether or not his claim shall be afforded
10 the scrutiny that's required.
11

QUESTION*

If you hadn't expanded the record as it

12 was expanded, and therefore on the finding against you on
13 the weightlifting you'd have had no claim, could you have
14 filed a new claim later?
15

MR. GREENs

16

QUESTION*

17

MR. GREEN*

Yes, sir, we could have.
Setting up this second ground.
We could have filed both a new claim

18and also a request for modification under Section 922.

The

19 law contemplates the filing of modification of awards and
20claims, both for the benefit of employer and insuror,
21 situations change, and also for the claimant.

should

It does not

22have the same finality as the common law.
23

QUESTION;

Does it have the same sweep as the --

24 as you would have in a common law place to move to amend the
25

Pleadings to conform with the proof?
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. GREENs

It certainly is analogous to that,

2 Justice Burger, it most certainly is analogous to that.

But

3 again, I am hampered from saying that it does because of
4 what this Court has announced in Del Vecchio; that we can't
5 speak to the analogy of the common law; we must speak to
6 what the statute requires, we must follow that statute.

And

7 as Justice Roberts said, this is what we must do.
8

I would urge this Court to do the same.

I would

9 respectfully suggest that there has been no swamping of
10claims by the D.C. Circuit or any other circuit since the
11 filing of this.

The so-called effect of the Riley decision

12 has not been seen anywhere.

Indeed, there are no additional

13 claims for the common cold that we could find, nor have any
14 been appended to this record.
15

We would urge the Supreme Court to consider that

16the Section 28 presumption has not been applied to the
17 benefit of the claimant, or more importantly,

the benefit of

18the administrative proceeding, so that this record would
19have answered all
20and

21

questions before it when they were raised

found by that administrative law judge.
Respectfully, we would suggest and we would urge

22 that the court of appeals should be affirmed.

24 for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. GALIHER, JR., ESQ

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

3

MR. GALIHER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

First

4 of all, there was a question from one of the Justices about
5 an occupational disease claim.

I have pointed out in my

6brief that there was no claim for occupational disease made
7 here, and the statute separately defines occupational
8 disease.
9

Secondly, with respect to the due process question

10 of Mr. Chief Justice, we do feel that there is a due process
11 question here with the operation of the presumption, because
12 we do feel that this is taking property based upon a legal
13 presumption, and the legal presumption that the D.C. Circuit
14 made was that there could be another claim encompassed
15 within this injury; another claim which we had no
16 opportunity to defend and no opportunity to rebut.
17

QUESTION;

Mr. Galiher, on that precise point,

18 your opponent says, if I understand him correctly, that

19 instead of appealing after they lost on their first theory,
20 they could have, in effect, filed a second alternative claim

21 saying well, it really was an aggravation of arthritis
22 rather than an accident at the hospital.

23

What is your view of the law on their right to do

24 something of that nature?
25

MR. GALIHER;

I think that's incorrect.

In this

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 act

there is a provision that you must file a claim within

2 one

year of the date of injury.

The only loophole to that

3 is that the employer must file a report of injury, but
4 within one year after the employer has filed the report
5 required by the statute, then the claim is barred by
6 limitations.

7

In this particular instance, the employer's report

8 is part of the record; we did file it,

so that Mr. Green

9 could not come back, except within this very proceeding, to
10 file a new claim.
11

Now, on the question of Section 22 of the act, it

12 specifically

talks about that there must be a mistake of

13 fact or a change of conditions.
14 previously raised to this court.

This issue was not
However,

we contend that

15 the administrative law judge made no mistake of fact here;
16 he decided the case as presented to him, and that the D.C.
17 Circuit changed it around.
18

I have nothing else.

19

QUESTION;

20 your petition,

But you didn't put that question in

did you?

21

MR. GALIHER;

22

QUESTION*

The question —

Whether or not the court of appeals

23 properly looked for and found another injury, other than
24 what had been tried out before the administrative law judge.
25

MR. GALIHER;

I do feel, Mr. Justice, that it was

46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 placed in there.

The implications of the decision were

2 fully argued, and this implication was one of them.
3

QUESTION*

I don’t see that question in your

4 Petition for Certiorari, though.
5

KR. GALIHERs

Well, the question is by reference

6 to the definition of injury.

The statutory definition of

7 injury as to whether or not this is in the course of
8 employment.
9

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well, thank you,

10 gentlemen, the case is submitted.
