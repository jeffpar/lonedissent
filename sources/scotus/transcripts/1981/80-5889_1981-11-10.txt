PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

3 first this morning in Santosky against Kramer
4

Mr. Guggenheim, you may proceed when you are ready.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARTIN GUGGENHEIM, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS;

7

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,

Thank you

9 the issue in this case is whether the state may permanently
10 destroy a family when it is not clear that the evidence
11 justifies doing so.

It is the Petitioners'

position that

12 the Constitution requires that the finder of fact be
13 reasonably convinced that the result of permanent
14 destruction of the family is appropriate before the state
15 may force such an irrevocable and fundamental deprivation of
16 liberty on an individual.
17

New York and eleven other states permit the

18 permanent destruction of a family based on quality of
19 evidence which is sufficient to prove liability in an
20 automobile accident.

This is offensive to basic notions of

21 due process.
22

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Guggenheim, I realize that

23 your point is certainly legally well taken, but do you think
24 your client would have been better served by the rather
25 searching family court inquiries in this case, albeit they

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 were said to be made upon the preponderance of the evidence
2 rather than a very short hearing in the family court which
3 announced that it found by "clear and convincing evidence"
4 that parental rights should be terminated and it was
5 affirmed by the appellate division?
6

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

Absolutely, not only in this case

7 but in the 1,200 other cases litigated in New York each year
8 on this subject.

It would of a measurable and real value,

a

9 benefit to parents because, as Justice Harlan indicated in
10Winship, what the standard of proof does, what the setting
11 of a constitutional standard of proof does is impress upon
12 the finder of fact the degree of confidence in the judgment
13 which is to be rendered.
14

Now, if your question, Justice Rehnquist, is

15 whether under any reading of this case a higher standard
16would have been met, the test for harmless error in
17 constitutional adjudication is a reasonable doubt test set
18 forth in Chapman against California.

The question would be

19whether any reasonable person could have found that this did
20 not amount to clear and convincing evidence.

21

QUESTION;

No, my question was directed more to

22 the practicality matter.
23 consider able time,

The family court devoted

and wrote out its conclusions, and held

24 more than one hearing on the matter, and the fact that it
25 ended up concluding that it was by the preponderance of the

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 evidence strikes me as being a rather technical point which
2 could have been obviated by a much shorter and less
3 searching inquiry than simply a boilerplate finding at the
4 end that we find this by clear and convincing evidence.
5

MR. GUGGENHEIM*

Courts have regularly reviewed

6 records upon a higher standard of proof, appellate courts
7 have, and in this case, the test before the appellate
8 division was merely whether the evidence did justify the
9 result by a preponderance of the evidence.
10

There is both an impression to be made upon the

11 finder of fact of the degree of confidence he or she should
12 have in making the finding, as well as an entire change of
13 the direction of the case, of the scope of the issue before
14 an appellate court.

The burden is more squarely placed upon

15 the state, and the question for review is whether they have
16 met that burden by convincing evidence.
17

I do think that this is a practical and meaningful

18 right being sought, both for the 1,200 cases each year and
19 for this one.
20

QUESTION:

From the size of the record in this

21 case, is it not guite clear that the judge gave it very
22 close attention, and made an exhaustive inquiry?
23

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

Absolutely.

There is no

24 challenge being made to the process attendant to the
25 proceedings or to the judge's own careful analysis of his

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 opinion other than a steadfast refusal to both declare the
2 statute unconstitutional insofar as it required a higher
3 standard of proof and a refusal to rule that by that higher
4 standard of proof this same result would have been
5 effected.

The trial court judge did not do that.

The

6 appellate court, the third department, appellate division,
7 affirmed expressly finding that the evidence satisfied the
8 preponderance standard, and expressly finding that a higher
9 standard was not constitutionally mandated.
10

QUESTION;

Mr. Guggenheim, if we were to agree

11 with you about the standard, what should we do with this
12 case?

Send this record back and tell them, look at this

13 record again and applying the correct standard, or to retry
14 it?
15

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

I think that the former

16 alternative would not necessarily be impermissible.
17 not certain of the answer.
18

QUESTION;

19

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

I am

I think that at least remand --

This is the trial record.
No, no, that is a very -- a bulky

20 set of exhibits annexed to this case, most of which we
21 regard, frankly, as unnecessary for consideration.

22 record is -23

QUESTION;

You don't suggest that the judge didn't

24 consider them.

25

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

I do suggest that, indeed.

QUESTIONS

2

ME. GUGGENHEIMi

That he didn’t consider them?
He did not.

Some of those are

3 simply reports issued after the case was decided, long after
4 the case was decided.

These are just exhibits submitted to

5 the court by the Respondent.

They were not -- Some of these

6 are part of the record in earlier litigation, dating back to
7 the time the children first entered the state's care, and
8 some of the parts of Volumes 1 and 2 do contain -- I don't
9 mean to suggest that anything submitted to this Court
10 respecting a transcript was not part of a record in an
11 earlier case.
12

I don’t mean that at all.

QUESTION;

Given the amount of time, the whole

13 record of this case, if you are correct on your standard,
14 would not the appropriate -- would it not spare this family
15 unit that you are concerned about, very properly,
16 considerable trauma if they didn't have to go through the
17 whole process again, if the judge would merely be directed
18 to evaluate this evidence on the standard that you are
19 suggesting if the court should happen to agree with that?
20

MR.

GUGGENHEIM;

Frankly, I find myself in a

21 difficult position answering that question candidly, because
22 there have been facts that have occurred after the trial
23 that are not in this record, that I think speak favorably to
24 the parents.

I don't know how to bring it to the Court's

25 attention without answering that a new trial, I think, would

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 be possibly appropriate,

but I do think frankly that

2 question should be considered by the appellate division

upon

3 remand for reconsideration in light of this Court's opinion

24

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

As I was saying, among the points

25 to be made here is that the decision to terminate is for

1 speculative purposes,
2 leading

It is for purposes of hopefully

to an adoption of a child.

Whatever happens after

3

the record is fixed is really for -- is beyond the capacity

4

of a parent or the court to reopen.
QUESTION*

5

Kay I ask, Mr. Guggenheim, under New

6 York law, suppose the state fails to get an order
7

terminating parental rights.

8

MR.

GUGGENHEIM:

9

QUESTION:

Yes.

May it come back later and seek such an

10 order?
11

MR.

GUGGENHEIM*

12

QUESTION;

Absolutely, and I think --

Suppose -- the state may, but suppose

13

the parents lose, and parental rights are terminated.

14

they any way of getting parental rights restored?
MR. GUGGENHEIM*

15

Have

No, none whatsoever under New

16

York law.

There is in most American jurisdictions the right

17

of a parent to reopen an adoption of a natural child based

18

upon fraud or duress within a period of time after the

19

adoption is fixed, but of course those standards would be

20 inapplicable to these types of proceedings.

22 case, and it underscores one of
23
24
25

Not only may

it did so in this very

the important advantages to

the state on its side when it litigates against parents.
In this case, it tried first to terminate
permanently in 1976.

The court found by a preponderance of

9

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the evidence they didn't have the ground sufficient under
2 state law to terminate.
3 appellate division,
4 here on

The state then appealed to the

the same court from which we are now

review, and that court affirmed, finding that the

5 preponderance of the standard -- of the evidence
6 and

wasn't met,

found for the parents in 1978j in that same year, they

7 filed this lawsuit

seeking to terminate a second time.

We are not suggesting that that is inappropriate.

8
9 We are not

suggesting that notions of res judicata are

10 applicable,
11 advantages

but merely to indicate one of the significant
the state has in this kind of proceeding.

We are, of course, here dealing with rights far

12

13 more precious than
14 fundamental

property rights, our most significant and

rights of all,

the rights to be with our

15 children, the rights to visit with our children,

to be with our parents and to know our

Guggenheim, that New York does have some advantages in its

2

system that other states do not have.

3

HR. GUGGENHEIM:

4

QUESTION;

I do make that concession.

I am speaking of the right to counsel,

5

the right to a representative of the child.

you call it.

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

QUESTION:

9
10

I forget what

Yes, that's correct.

And yet this Court in Lassiter last

year said that the right to counsel was not constitutionally
mandated .
MR. GUGGENHEIM;

11

Yes, but Lassiter flows from the

12

Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and from an entirely

13

different analytic framework.

14

15

19

MR. GUGGEN HEIM;

Well, I respe ctf ully suggest

20

that.

I am not sure I disagree with som e o f those views,

21

but the point is tha t Scott held that th e b right line is not

22

even threat of impri sonment, as it might be in a jury case.

23

It is actual impriso nmen t.

24

that. Justice Blackm un, even those who d issented might agree

25

with the phrase that counsel cases come to this Court with a

So the presu mpt ion - - I think

1 presumption against application of counsel automatically
2 except where there is a loss of liberty.
3

Where the Court may have disagreed, I think, was

4 how to resolve the particulars in Lassiter, the dissent
5 finding that counsel was necessary to meet due process
6 overcoming the presumption, but at least for five members of
7 this Court the presumption does follow logically, even if
8 the result in Lassiter could be disputed, from Scott, and
9 from Argesinger, and from Gideon.

In standard of proof

10 cases, that bright line has never existed.
11

This Court didn't utilize that reasoning in Vance

12 against Terrazas.

To the contrary, the Court examined quite

13 carefully the heavy burden on the state to show voluntary,
14 purposeful relinquishment of citizenship as a balancing
15 question in determining what standard of proof was
16 necessary, and so Lassiter, of course, for those states in

17 substantive due process in this kind of case.

Justice

18 Stevens’s dissent in Lassiter recognized the point that the
19 Mathews and Eldridge test belittles constitutional analysis,
20 or is mistaken constitutional analysis when we are concerned
21 with fundamental, basic liberty rights, such as the right
22 of parents and children to be related to each other.
23

QUESTION*

You have spoken to the rights of the

24 parents here, and of course that is very important, but is
25 there not a

right which is more important than the right of

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the parents, namely, the right of the child, or the chidren?
2

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

Absolutely, and this case is not

3 at all to suggest that permanent destruction of a family is
4 inappropriate.

But permanent destruction of a family when

5 it is unnecessary is inappropriate.

Permanent destruction

6 of a family which shouldn't be done by the state is
7 offensive to the rights of children, at least as much so to
8 the rights of parents.

To be made a permanent ward of the

9 state needlessly, to lose the love and affection of a family
10-- even to know that there are parents out there, as this
11 Court recognized in Kabann, is a fundamental right, and this
12 case doesn't suggest that children aren't entitled at some
13 point to be severed from their parents.

This case is merely

14 to suggest that when that grave act is set out, that it be
15 done so in a convincing manner.
16
17here?

QUESTION:

What was the standard that was applied

I mean, what was the substantive rule that was

18 applied here?
19

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

The question before the court

20 that was litigated, although the test is a little broader

21 than this, was whether the parents substantially,
22 continuously, or repeatedly planned for the future of their

23 chi Id.
24

QUESTION:

Well, now, is it your contention that

25 the clear and convincing standard should apply to the

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

2 said what, or what actions people take?
3 are

talking about?

Is that what you

Or are you talking about the conclusion

4 from these facts that this standard has been violated?

Or

5 both?

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

7 question in

The

the latter context, I think, embraces more

8 directly the question of
9 and

I think only the former.

the scope of the substantive test,

I think a challenge to that ought to be made

10 forthrightly.

QUESTION:

11

12 conclusion

By the latter, do you mean the

that it is in the best interest of the child or

13 the children to be separated from

the parent?

That is the

14 ultimate conclusion, is it not?

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

15

Well, except that New York

16 bifurcates those questions, and
17 at a dispositional hearing

makes the final revocation

where the standard is merely best

18 interests.
19

QUESTION:

As to which of the se do you direct your
convincing evidence stan dard ?

MR. GUGGENHEIM:

Whether the parents and the state

in conduct or failed to engage in conduct which

23 justifie s the termination itself.

The condition precedent

24 to the o rder terminating rights is a fi nding by the court
25 based on an

historical record that the parents did or did

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 not do something and that the agency or state did or did not
2 do something, and I think Justice White's question embracing
3 the second component goes more directly to a substantive
4 challenge to a standard.
5

QUESTION:

Well, I just wanted to know what your

6 contention was.
7

NR. GUGGENHEIM:

8

QUESTIONi

It is that the facts have to be --

1 when you are not convinced
2

QUESTION;

that it is the right thing to do.

Hr. Guggenheim, isn't it utlimately

3 perhaps more important to look at the overall scheme and
4 requirements for severance of parental rights to determine
5 whether it is a fundamentally fair scheme for handling the
6 problem than to simply apply an artificial standard of
7 proof, without an examination of the entire scheme?
8

HR. GUGGENHEIM;

I think an examination of the

9 entire scheme is appropriate, but I think that in any case
10 where the finder of

fact is convinced no more than the

11 evidence is probably right, no more that would justify a
12 showing that somebody struck somebody in an automobile and
13 has to pay damages.

It just isn't enough, and Justice

14Blackmun's question respecting the distinction in Lassiter,
15 where that is exactly what the Court did, it said, we will
16 look at each case as it comes,

simply cannot be done in this

17 context.
18

This case wouldn't be before this Court unless

19 there was a

substantial question that the Constitution

20 requires a higher standard

of proof.

If the Court were to

21 rule that there is no constitutional requirement of standard
22 of proof, certiorari couldn’t even be brought under
23 this Court

-- to

to review the record, but even if it could, or if

24 the appellate courts were to
25 the fact judge that,

review records, you can't after

well, this did meet the preponderance

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of the evidence standard, but somehow that is not enough
2 here.

That is not the way law is made.

It is instead in

3 this kind of context, the allocation of risk must be
4 calibrated in advance.

The degree to which we want the

5 finder of fact to be convinced must be set out before the
6 trial takes place so that the parties know in what framework
7 they are litigating.
8

QUESTION;

What in practice is the difference

9 between the standard by a preponderance of the evidence and
10 the standard by clear and convincing evidence?
11

MR. GUGGENHEIM;

12 Addington against Texas,

Chief Justice Burger, in
I believe, wrote that we may never

13 know the answer to that question, but we do know that there
14 is a difference.

We do know, as this Court in Sumner

15 against Mather just last term, Justice Fehnquist's opinion
16 pointed out that the difference between overturning a

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SCAVUZZO;

Good morning.

Mr. Chief Justice,

2 At issue before the Court is the constitutionality of a
3 comprehensive state plan dealing with an important state
4 interest in an area of domestic relations traditionally
5 regarded as a matter of state law.
6

The New York permanent neglect statute is the

7 result of a delicate balancing of competing and intertwined
8 interests between multiple parties whose rights and
9 relationships are affected by all the branches of
10 gov eminent.

We don't feel, in light of the record in this

11 case, that a different standard of proof would vary the
12 outcome.

However, if the Court should raise the burden, it

13 would frustrate a specific intent of the legislature.

NR. SCAVUZZO;

9

MR. SCAVUZZO;

Oh, no.

The legislature adopted

10 the new law based upon the conclusions in that temporary
11 commissions.

As a result of that finding, they specifically

12 decided to raise the standard to clear and convincing in
13 cases where both parents, due to their mental illness, could
14 not take care of their children in the foreseeable future,
15 but they specifically decided not to raise the standard in
16 permanent neglect cases, so that another barrier would not
17 be raised to the adoption of these children.

1 of proceeding, it is also not mental illness such that they
2 cannot care for themselves or care for their children in the
3 foreseeable future.

The legislature felt in that intance

4 that the parents should be protected due to the nature of
5 the scientific testimony by a higher standard of proof.

QUESTIONi

Let me ask another question.

We are

7 concerned primarily with three children here, aren't we?

MR. SCAVUZZOs

Yes , Your Honor.

These people have two others, younger.

10

MR. SCAVUZZO;

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. SCAVUZZO;

13

QUESTION;

Yes , Your Honor, they do.

Has the state ever moved on them?
No, Your Honor, they have not.

Are you in a position then that they

14 are unfit to handle the three older ones but not unfit to
15 handle the two younger ones?
16

ME. SCAVUZZO;

17 Honor, they would be.

At this particular time, yes, Your
I would like to point out to the

18 Court that at the time of the dispositional hearing,
19 parental rights cannot be terminated at the permanent

20 neglect finding which Petitioners are suggesting now is
21 unconstitutional.

There is a dispositional hearing later on

22 under New York law.

23

At that time, the parents had two children living

24 in the home.

They had the opportunity to demontsrate to the

25 judge that notwithstanding the previous finding of permanent

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 neglect, the children could be returned home in the
2 foreseeable future, that notwithstading the previous finding
3 of permanent neglect, the children could be returned home in
4 the foreseeable future.

That is, conditions in the home had

5 changed since that one-year period of permanent neglect.
6 They had that opportunity to bring in the precise inference
7 that the two children being in the home now would raise.
8

QUESTION*

Of course, the parents are older, and

9 the family is smaller with two than it would be with five.
10 On the other hand, if one takes away -- if the state takes
11 away a driver's license in the state of New York, it is on
12 clear and convincing evidence, isn't it?
13

MR. SCAVUZZOi

14

QUESTION*

Yes.

That is more important than taking away

15 children?
16

MR. SCAVUZZOi

No, absolutely not.

What you have

17 to look at is the entire package, the entire package of
18 rights which is guaranteed by the New York state statute.
19 Petitioners are challenging only one particular aspect of
20 that statute.

The safeguard -- There are more safeguards

21 under this type of permanent neglect statute than there
22 would be in the the one hearing to take away a driver's
23 license.

There is in this case an initial removal

24 proceeding, where, based upon a finding of abuse and
25 neglect, the child is removed from the home.

Again, there is a permanent neglect finding which

4 another hearing.

There is

At that other hearing, known as the

5 dispositional hearing, the government has the burden again
6 to show that notwithstanding the previous finding, the
7 children cannot be returned to the home.
8

There is also, I would like to point out, direct

9 the Court's attention to Family Court Section 1061.

Upon

10 good cause shown, the parents may move to vacate any order
11 of the family court.

One of the grounds is precisely this

12 newly discovered evidence that Petitioners are alluding to
13 here, so they do have another opportunity.

They certainly

14 have the opportunity at the dispositional hearing to present
15 further evidence.
16

QUESTION:

But, Hr. Scavuzzo, once at the

17 dispositional hearing there is an order terminating parental
18 rights, that is the end of it, isn't it?

Can the parents

20 unless they are fully convinced, which certainly implies

21 that the evidence is clear and it is convincing to the
22 judge, and that it is probably more than a preponderance.

In your brief, you suggest that the right at stake

25 here is comparable

My question is, would that be

16

QUESTION*

Well, but it may well be -- well,

17 anyway, you say that would be unconstitutional.

What is

18 wrong with placing the burden on the parents as a matter of
19 constitutional law if they have all the other procedures and

20 protections you talk about?
21

MR. SCAVUZZOi

Certainly under New York law, as we

22 would suggest should be the case, the burden should be on

23 the state to prove that the family cannot be reunited in the
24 foreseeable future.

That is the essence of this law.

25 is where the state switches roles.

That

2 can do no other.

They

At some point in time, however, the

3 agency, checked by the trial judge, has to make a
4 determination that that goal is no longer possible and that
5 the children cannot be returned home in the foreseeable
6 future.

It is only at that point does the state have the

7 right to go in and terminate those rights.
8

Again, the legislature evaluated how that precise

9 standard operated under New York law, and came to the
10 conclusion, the well-reasoned conclusion, that the risk of
11 error still ran considerably in favor of the parents.
12

The substantive grounds based here, the failure to

13 plan, are neither vague nor subjective.
14 specifically defined by the law.

They are

That failure to plan for

15 the child's future is merely the failure to utilize the
16 programs and services which are available to the particular
17 parent.

The plan relates to the initial problem.

There

18 should be no question here there was an initial problem in
19 the Santosky home.

The plan, the services made available to

20 the parents are then utilized to solve that problem.
21

I would like to point out that the parents can

22 formulate a plan of their own.

They need not adopt the

23 agency's plan, utilize the services which the agency offers

24 them.

A good example is the facts and circumstances here.

One government witness testified after approximately

This was in 1976.

16 The children had been away from the home for approximately

The government witness testified that, yes, they

19 were making some type of movement, they were benefitting
20 from our service, and Mr. and Mrs. Santosky took the stand

21 and felt, yes, they had received the benefit from the
22 service.

That was enough for the trial judge to say, yes,

23 these people are utilizing the services.

They are taking

24 advantage of them, and thus planning for the future of their

QUESTION;

But you don't know the total cost of

11 this care of these children, do you?
12

MR. SCAVUZZO;

No, Your Honor, I don’t.

If the

13 Court is interested, I would be happy to provide that
14 information.

The evidence, the failure to utilize those

15 services, indicated a state of mind of the parents, that
16 these parents had virtually abandoned their children at that
17 termination proceeding in April of 1979.

The trial court

18 described their meetings between parent and child as devoid
19 of any type of emotional contact.

The children viewed those

20 meetings as something merely to be endured.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

2

MR. GUGGENHEIMi

The question of the rights of the

3 children and the rights of the parents here are,

as Justice

4 Stevens suggested just a moment ago, before the Court in the
5 same context.

It begs the question to suggest that their

6 interests are different.

They may be and they may not be.

7 Chief Justice Burger indicated in questions to Mr. Scavuzzo
8 that

judges around the country, commentators have told us,

9 frequently regard the decision to terminate of such a great
10 moment that

they want to be convinced that it is the right

11 thing

to do before they do it.

That is because, if it is

12 true,

we have recognized as a society the social disutility

13 of an erroneous permanent destruction of a family.
14

This case merely would suggest that that social

15 disutility is of constitutional moment.
16 Justice Burger has stated,

If, as Chief

the commentators correctly to be

17 correct and people are doing this already,
18 is lost by it.

then very little

But if people are not doing it, if children

19 are being destroyed needlessly, then this case will protect
20 them,
21

and that should be done.
Even where, and the record shows this, permanent

22 destruction is effected, adoption, which could be the only

23 feasible benefit accruing to the children, is effected only
24 about 40 percent of the time.
25 percent of the time.

So we have children -- 60

I am sorry.
