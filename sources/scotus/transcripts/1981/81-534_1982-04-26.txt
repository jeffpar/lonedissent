ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE S. HALABY, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7
8

MR. HALABY:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

9

This case arises out of a confrontation that

10

occurred in a Denver, Colorado, city park between three

11

officers of the Denver police department and the father

12

of the Respondents and a companion of that father.

13

QUESTION:

Eafore you get too far into the

14

merits, hr.

15

read the State Supreme Court's opinion, the trial court

16

had dismissed the 1983 action on a motion for summary

17

dismissal on the ground that the remedy was exclusively

18

under state law for death by a wrongful act.

19

that basis the State Supreme Court reversed the trial

20

court and said,

21

judgment sending it back, and therefore the case is now

22

back where it started and would go to trial.

23

correct?

24
25

Halaby,

let me ask you this question.

As I

Now, on

no, you should not have had summary

ME. HALABY;

Is that

Not absolutely, Mr. Chief

Justice.

2

QUESTION:

Well,

what would have happened if

you had not brought the case here?

3

ME. HALABY:

If we had not brought the case

4

here, the two claims, the

5

brought on behalf of the estate and the personal 1983

6

claims of the children of the decedent, both would have

7

been remanded for trial in the district court and tried

8

there.

9

1983 survivorship claims

The relief Petitioners are seeking --

10

QUESTION:

Well, before you go into that, did

11

you raise the 1985, Section

12

the

13

1985 question here, or only

1983?
MR. HALABY:

We have only raised

one issue,

14

and that deals with the children of the decedent, the

15

Respondents herein, and whether or not they may assert

16

personal 1983 claims.

17

of the 1985 claims.

18

not raised the dismissal of the

19

to the chief of police, who was. sued strictly in a

20

supervisory capacity.

21

of those claims.

22

We have not raised the dismissal
Neither have Respondents.

We have

1983 claims with respect

We have not raised the dismissal

We have only raised the finding of the

23

Colorado Supreme Court insofar as it recognized a

24

personal constitutional right in the child to a

25

continuing family relationship, which would afford that

child a claim pursuant to Section 1983 for deprivation

2

of that right*

3

QUESTION:

I'm sure it's apparent to you what

4

I'm driving at is whether there is a case here, whether

5

there is jurisdiction.

6

brought the case here, if I understood you, you would

7

have gone to trial on the 1983 question in the state

8

court, with an obligation on the part of the state court

9

to apply federal law.

io

NR. HALABY:

11

14

Is that correct?
That's correct.

If we had not

brought the case here —

12

13

And you say that if you had not

QUESTION:

Then is there a final judgment

here?

SR. HALABY:

There is. a final judgment, we

15

submit, with respect to the claims of the children,

16

because unless the Court recognizes that constitutional

17

right they are not parties to the action, they have no

18

claims whatsoever.

19

children there is1 -- unless this Court is to affirm the

20

finding of the Colorado Supreme Court with respect to

21

the claims of those children, since they did not assert

22

their state rights under the wrongful death statute,

23

they would have no claims, they would not be parties to

24

the action.

25

QUESTION:

So with respect to the claims of the

But the Colorado Supreme Court

R

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

upheld those claims

2

MR. HALABY:

That's correct. Justice

3

Rehnquist.

4

unprecedented fashion.

5

And we submit they did so erroneously in an

QUESTION;

But if they did uphold them, it was

6

simply to say that in the abstract it stated a claim for

7

relief or what have you under Section 1983, and that the

8

trial court, I take it, on remand, was to try the case.

9

MR. EALABY :

10
11
12

QUESTIONS

That's correct.
Is that a final judgment under

1257?
MR. HALABYs

It is not a final judgment in

13

that respect, in that the claims have not been tried and

14

the Colorado Supreme Court has not ruled specifically on

15

the merits of those claims.

16

urge consideration by this Court because of the profound

17

ramifications of this finding, not only in the State of

18

Colorado but nationwide.

19

QUFSTIO'N:

However, we would still

Counsel, aren’t there only about

20

four exceptions to our taking — to the final judgment

21

rule, and how does this fit into any of those

22

exceptions?

23

<

MR. HALABY:

Ue would submit that because it

24

is a decision in conflict with prior decisions of this

25

Court and has such profound consequences, that this

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

issue is ripe for the consideration of this Court.

2

^OESTIOM;

Hell, that would be a new

3

exception, in addition to any that we've ever recognized

4

before.

5

MR. HALABYi

I believe this Court -- it does

6

fit within what this Court has recognized before with

7

respect to fundamental decisions that have run contrary

8

to this Court, which is what we asserted in our petition

9

in the first instance, in terms of the fact that it was

10

in conflict with the prior decisions of this Court, that

11

if this decision of the Colorado Supreme Court is left

12

unreversed that the profound negative consequences,

13

which we submit are improper, would have ramifications

14

that are uncorrected.

15

So we would submit that, while there is not a

16

final decision on the merits of the children's claims,

17

since they have not been tried in the district court,

18

that it is still an issue that is ripe for consideration

19

of this Court.

Well, what if you win below?

What

if there had been -- what if you hadn't come here and

there were a remand and you won, or if the children got

less than $45,000.

MR. HALABYi

Well, in either instance, Justice

Blackman, if we won or they get less than that, we

How do you know that the Colorado

20

NR. HALABY:

Well, based on the decision of

21

the Colorado Supreme Court in recognizing the

22

constitutional right of the child, that alone prevents

23

us from accomplishing what we are seeking.

24

on the trial on the merits in the district court we may

25

be successful, which would then preclude any harm.

Of course,

QUESTION:

And if you are not successful on

that issue, then you might be able to come here.

3

ME, HALABY:

4

QUESTION:

5

That's correct, Your Honor.
Is the other -- is the alternative

ground for recovery still open in the district court?

6

ME. HALABY:

The alternative ground for

7

recovery under the wrongful death statute?

8

because the Respondent children have not sought to seek

9

their remedy under the state wrongful death statute.

No, simply

10

They have only asserted one claim and that's their

11

federal claim pursuant to Section 1983.

12
13

QUESTION:

And it's still open, isn’t it?

I

mean, they can amend their claim, I suppose.

14

MR. HALABY:

I believe they still can.

They

were granted leave by the district court to amend their

claim.

They chose not to, but stand simply on their

QUESTION:

How do you understand — what do

19

you understand to' be the position of the amicus in this

20

case, the ACLU?

21

MR. HALABY:

Well, my understanding of their

22

position is that this issue, as Justice O'Connor raised,

23

is not ripe for consideration by this Court.

24

understand that to be their position.

25

they ask this Court to affirm and remand the rulings of

And so therefore

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Colorado Supreme Court, which would seem to me would

2

be a decision on the merits.

3

QUESTION:

4

ME. KALABY:

5

QUESTION:

But their first suggestion is to

varate, isn't it?

8
9

That was one of the alternatives,

Justice Behnquist, that was suggested by the amicus.

6
7

Certainly if we affirm.

ME. HALABY:

Vacate on the grounds of

certiorari being improviiently granted, similar to an

10

analogous case arising out of Colorado in the Jones v.

11

Hildebrant case, where this Court similarly dismissed as

12

having been imprevidently granted.

3

But we would submit that it is within the

4

discretion of this Court to decide this issue at this

5

time, and that the importance of this issue is so

6

overwhelming that it would deserve resolution at this

7

time.

8

QUESTIO":

Could you help me with one other

procedural question?

I had some -- I wasn’t sure I

20

entirely understood your Justice Erickson's concurring

21

opinion.

22

to decide what it did, because ,it could remand on --

23

just on the survivorship claim, is that what he was

24

saying.

25

He said that the majority didn't really need

MR. HALABY:

I believe what Justice Erickson

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

was suggesting was that the Colorado Supreme Court vent

2

far beyond the issues in terms of trying to fashion an

3

overall remedy in consideration of 1983 claims being

4

asserted in state courts.

5

objected to, while he agreed with the bottom line

6

findings of the court in terms of remanding both the

7

1983 survivorship claims of the estate and the personal

8

1983 claims of the children.

9

And I believe that is what he

But what he objected to was the court's going

10

beyond those particular issues in terms that he felt

11

were net before the court, in terms of fashioning an

12

overall remedy or procedural concept in how the state

13

court should handle 1983 claims.

14

QUESTION:

Did I correctly understand that on

15

remand, as things stand now, there may be a death claim

16

on behalf of the children for the injury to their

17

relationship to their father, the loss of the father;

18

and secondly, there may be a survivorship claim on

19

behalf of the est'ate for the injury to the man himself?

20

And you're not — under 1983 — and you’re not

21

challenging the latter?

22

MR. HALABY;

23

survivorship right.

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes, we are not challenging the

And you say that the cause of

action that the deceased had under 1983 survives?

No, Justice White, we would

submit that is a federal law question --

Yes.

Yes, right.
— as determined -Well, whatever it is, you agree it

survives ?
MR. HALABY;

Yes.

I think that this Court's

11

decision in Robertson v. Wegmann supports that finding.

12

We do not contest that finding.

13

QUESTION:

And if you lost on both of the

14

claims that would- be open on remand, the survivorship

15

claim and then this, the personal 1983 claim of the

16

children, if you lost them both one wouldn't cancel out

17

the other, I take it, or would they?

18

MR. HALABY:

19

QUESTION;

20
21

22

I mean, the recovery in one would

be added to the other?
MR. HALABY;

I believe so.

I believe they're

mutually exclusive remedies.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. HALABY:

25

No, I believe --

Right.
I don’t think there's any

question about that.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

And with respect to each of them,

2

the federal recovery would be larger than the state law

3

recovery, because they include these personal elements

4

of damage other than pecuniary damages, or is that not

5

correct?

6

MR. HALAEY:

We would submit that either under

7

-- under either the state remedy or the federal remedy,

8

the measure of damages would be the same.

9

survivorship claims, we would submit that the remedy

Under the

10

provisions under the state survivor statute would

11

control the relief that could be obtained pursuant to

12

the

13
14

1983 survivorship statute.
QUESTION:

Won't that be because we borrowed

Colorado law?

15

MR. HALABY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. HALAEY:

18

QUESTION;

But we borrowed —

19

QUESTION*

What supports that, may I ask?

20

MR. HALABY:

21

22

That’s correct.
But it's still federal law.
It's still federal law.

Robertson v. Wegmann would

support that.
I might point out that what we would submit

23

has been considerable confusion concerning the

24

construing the state death statutes, the wrongful death

25

statute and the survivor statute, with claims under

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

1983.

2

that the state death statutes cannot bear any relevance

3

as to whether or not a 1983 claim can be asserted in the

4

first instance.

We would submit particularly in this instance

5

Following the rationale of the Colorado

6

Supreme Court, it is consistent to state that it dees

7

not require death of the father in this case to give

8

rise to the 1983 claim in terms of affecting this family

9

relationship between the parent and child.

Instead,

10

false imprisonment could give rise and would be the same

11

type of intrusion in the family relationship which,

12

according to the Colorado Supreme Court's rationale,

13

would afford the basis for the child to assert a

14

personal 1983 claim.

15

find clearly, if the father is not dead and has

16

simply been removed from that family relationship,

17

albeit for life, that family relationship with the child

18

is affected almost to the same degree as if the father

19

was dead.

20

the death statutes, the wrongful death statute and the

21

survival statute of Colorado, would not apply in any

22

instance.

23

Yet cTearly, with the father not being dead

,
Therefore, any discussion, we submit, that the

24

remedies provided under the state death statutes can

25

somehow relate to claims under 1983 has no basis.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The finding of the Colorado Supreme Court is

2

premised, as was mentioned, on a personal liberty

3

interest in the continuing family relationship with that

4

father.

5

finding, that this Court n r any other appellate court

6

has ever so recognized such a personal constitutional

7

interest in a child.

8
9

We submit that this is an unprecedented

There has been one court that decided the
issue on point.

The Seventh Circuit affirmed without

10

comment an opinion of the Illinois District Court in

11

Evain v. Conlisk that found that no such right exists.

12

The Colorado court, we submit erroneously, deduced from

13

this Court’s finding in Stanley versus Illinois that

14

this Court recognized a cc .stitutionally protected right

15

between the relationship of the father toward the child,

16

and therefore that reciprocal right of the child to the

17

parent must also exist.

18

But Petitioners further submit that that was

19

an erroneous find'ing, was a misinterpretation of

20

Stanley, and even if it was a correct interpretation of

21

Stanley that such a — there was a constitutionally

22

protected right of the fatner foward the child, one

23

cannot state that this reciprocal right between -- of

24

the child to the parent ipso facto exists.

25

right of a different kind, of a different nature, and

That is a

aVE.,

S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

whether or not this right exists must be determined on

2

the basis of the principles set forth by this Court in

3

the abortion case of Roe v. Wade as to whether it is a

4

constitutional liberty interest that exists.

5

It must be fundamental or implicit in the

6

concept of ordered liberty, and what has normally been

7

found to be fundamental or implicit in the concept of

8

ordered liberty normally involves those choices, freedom

9

of choices or freedom of decisions, such as a parent to

10

have a child or not to have a child.

11

find with respect to the child's relationship

12

with the parent, this does not involve a freedom of

13

choice for a decision.

14

which the child has no control over.

15

this carried through in lawsuits that children have

16

sought to bring for wrongful life, where there was found

17

to be no basis in fact because the child doesn't have

18

any choice.

19

It is a happenstance, of course,
And we have found

So therefore, even if; this Court were to

20

recognize a personal liberty interest and protection of

21

the parent with respect to the protection of his

22

relationship with this child, that reciprocal

23

constitutional right in the child would not exist with

24

respect to his continuing family relationship with his

25

parent.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

I don't think one needs to use one's

2

imagination to any great degree to recognize the

3

profound ramifications, not only upon the liability of

4

public entities, but on the federal judiciary itself,

5

because if this concept of continuing family

6

relationship is afforded constitutional protection we

7

submit that even the slightest state intrusion in this

8

family relationship would give rise not only to one 1983

9

claim, but every member of that family relationship

10

would be afforded each a personal 1983 claim.

Your argument about the reciprocal

Stanely would stand for the — arguably might stand for

the proposition that the parent has an interest in the

You argued, as I understood you, that

MR. KALABY:

We say it hasn’t been recognized,

16

nor would it exist, that the parent would have a

17

constitutionally protected relationship with the child.

18

But even if that were found to be so, as the Colorado

19

Supreme Court fou<nd, clearly the child would not have a

20

constitutionally protected relationship with respect to

21

the parent.

22

QUESTION:

So that rule would protect against

23

suits by the children, but not against suits by the

24

parents.

But we submit that

Well, I understood your basic

position, or a least one of your positions, was that the

MR. HALABY;

If the state does not have a

survivorship statute that allows for the claims of a

17

decedent to survive his death, then there would not be a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT. H. ROBINSON, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. ROBINSON;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:

23

This Court has before it in a 1983 context a

24

state statute which basically makes it more profitable

25

for police officers to kill than to wound.

It's an

3

our brief to this Court.

4

which is cite! to the Court in both briefs, but which

5

was left out, I think, through inadvertence, and that's

6

the first part of what we call the survivorship claim.

7

But when you read these four statutes you'll

It's a four-part survival and wrongful

see that they're very complicated, they're very

9

confusing.

Basically, Colorado law on the subject of

10

wrongful death and on the subject of survivorship is

11

that very little survives, and as regards wrongful death

12

damages are limited to $45,000 unless a dependent,

13

mother or father, child or spouse, is left living.

14

There's^ also what we call the net pecuniary

15

16

you can earn.

17

statutes which are before this Court.

That's the statute — those are the

there's been no question but that what a federal

that federal question can be said to survive or might be

said — if it’s possible that that federal question

way they structured their opinion, whether or not we

were denied relief because of the associational claims

MR. ROBINSON;

structured, Justice White, is this;

clearly that there are associations 1 rights for which

damages are recoverable, and also that the wrongful

15

death and survivorship statutes are inconsistent with

theory in Colorado and hopefully some other states.

14

whether the Court1 avoids the issue on this occasion or

15

not, the point of the matter is that this Court is going

16

to get faced with a question of state law which severely

17

restricts recovery in the 1983 context when death

18

occurs.

19

They're recurring

you can try this case out on the survivorship theory.

7

You're going to do that too, aren't you?

NR. ROBINSON:

The problem is — this is why

we’re in a quandary, because the Colorado Supreme Court

10

said, well, now that we've givenn you all you wanted

11

over here in the associational rights, you're stuck with

12

state law on the survivorship rights.

And I don’t know

Well, what about the claim of the

decedent himself for wrongful death?

17

NR. ROBINSON:

QUESTION:

19

NR. ROB'INSON:

Does that claim

Yes, but.

But what?
But the Colorado Supreme Court

20

held that because we gave you these associational

21

rights, that survivorship claim for the death of the

22

decedent is limited by the $45,000 rule, the net

23

pecuniary loss rule, and, which hasn’t been mentioned,

24

the ban on exemplary damages.

That was one of the three areas

of Colorado law which we and the Colorado Supreme Court

12

felt were inconsistent.

13

or punitive damages question, the net pecuniary loss

14

rule question, and the $45,000 ceiling r-uestion.

15

three aspects of Colorado law are those elements that at

16

the beginning of my presentation I stated I felt gave an

17

incentive to law enforcement officers to kill rather

18

than maim, because by so doing they limit their

19

liability extensively.

We have the exemplary damages

Those

20

And there's also an indemnification statute,

21

incidentally, if the recovery was $45,000, which would

22

ensure that the officer involved never had a penny come

23

out of his pocket.

24
25

QUESTION:

That statute goes as high as

$100,000, doesn’t it?

1

MR. ROBINSON;

2

So the gut reaction, the final result of all

3

of this, is that a police officer in Colorado kills in

4

violation of the constitutional rights secured by

5

Section 1983, or at least the civil right is secured,

6

then winds up out of pocket not at all, no exemplary or

punitive damages.

Well, Justice Marshall, in 1871

when the Ku Klux Klan Act was passed, of which this is

Section 1, there ‘were no wrongful death statutes, and

that one cannot assert a 1983 wrongful death claim.

How, we would also submit that what the

8

and we must have the right before we can even consider

10

The right must exist irrespective of the remedy,

Put what Respondent is urging is, because of

11

the remedies available under the survivorship statute

12

and under the wrongful death statute in Colorado, which

1w

Respondent believes is not substantial enough, this

1,

Court should now fashion a right that would provide for

remedies unrestricted by those two statutes.

Of cour'se it would be difficult to argue that

20

a wrongful death statute or a survival statute, both of

21

which are premised on death, could affect a living

22

logically it would he difficult to argue that the death
