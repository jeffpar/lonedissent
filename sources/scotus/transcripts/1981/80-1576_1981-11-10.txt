ORAL ARGUMENT OF NICHOLAS deB. KATZENBACH, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8

MR. KATZENBACH;

Thank you, Mr.

Chief Justice, and

9 may it please the Court;
10

This case involves the rights of a private

11 university under the federal Constitution,
12 Fifth and Fourteenth

the First and

Amendments, to determine without state

13 governmental interference the expressive activities of
14 strangers that it permits upon its property.
15

QUESTION;

16 involve whether
17

Well, Mr. Katzenbach, doesn't it also

Princeton should be here at all?

MR. KATZENBACH;

It does, Justice Rehnquist.

18 question has been raised of
19 right now if you wish.
20 that you would
21

standing and I'll address that

Is there any particular part of it

wish me to address or do you want me to --

QUESTION;

22 trespass the matter

Ordinarily in a state prosecution for
is tried in the criminal courts, and in

23 this case the Supreme Court of
24 think

The

New Jersey said, although we

perhaps the federal Constitution would not prohibit

25 trespass, we interpret our state constitution to forbid

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

this

1 type of prosecution.

So the indictment is dismissed or the

2 prisoner freed.
3

And then how does Princeton get in here?

4

MR. KATZENBACH*

Princeton gets in, Your Honor,

5 because it was invited by the Supreme Court of New Jersey to
6 intervene in the case.

I think that the word "Intervenor"

7 means that you're there as a party.
8

QUESTION

But does that mean you’re here too, as

9 well as —
10

MR. KATZENBACH*

11 were a party in that case

I think so, yes, because if we
under state law and properly so,

12 unless there's some constitutional reason, a due process
13 reason, which has not been suggested in this case, as to why
14 we would not be there, then I think we have participated in
15 a decision where we were bound, a decision in which we
16 participated, in which we have an interest, and in which we
17 are bound by the result.
18

QUESTIONi

Then you couldn't enforce or even try to

19 enforce your rule again without -- which you might have been
20 able to do if you hadn't been a party.
21

MR. KATZENBACH*

That's correct, I believe.

If we

22 had been invited to participate, for example, as amicus, I
23 think it would have been open to us following the opinion
24 there, and assuming that it was not appealed to this Court,
25 it would have been open to Princeton to have sought an

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 injunction against Mr. Shmid or the American Labor Party
2 from coming onto the campus at Princeton, and that would
3 have proceeded through the Supreme Court of the state and
4 then on here on appeal.
5

How, that -- if that were the law of this Court,

6 then obviously we should not have accepted the invitation of
7 the Supreme Court to be an intervenor, because we lost our
8 rights of appeal as a result.
9

QUESTION;

That also creates -- is sufficient to

10 create a case or controversy between you and somebody.
11

MR. KATZENBACH;

12 Honor, I do.

I think it is real, yes. Your

I think that we have sacrificed rights,

13 Princeton has sacrificed rights in this case if, as I
14 believe, they are bound by that decision which they were
15 invited to intervene in and which they fully participated
16 in.
17

And I see it to be no different, unless there's a

18 constitutional

reason, from moving, as we did, for rehearing

19 in the state court.

20 that motion.

The state did not happen to join in

That motion was denied because none of the

21 justices wished to hear it.
22

If it had been heard and the decision reversed,

23 then that would be the same position that it would be in if
24 this Court were to remand it on the ground that the New
25 Jersey constitution violated rights of the property owner

5

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 under the First and Fifth Amendments.
2

QUESTION:

Is it possible Princeton made an

3 imprudent decision to accept the invitation to intervene

4 instead of declining that and volunteering to file a brief
5 amicus?
6

7 mistake?

MR. KATZENBACH;

Is it possible that was a

I hope not.

8

(Laughter. )

9

MR. KATZENBACH:

10 to intervene.

Because it certainly was invited

And New Jersey, Mr. Chief Justice, has a

11 very, very liberal view of intervention.

And it is not

12 unusual even in criminal cases to have intervention,
13 although it is unusual for private parties to be in that.
14 Normally the courts will invite a municipality or a borough
15 or somebody else who has some interest in a criminal
16 prosecution, even though not technically a criminal

17 prosecutor, to intervene.
18

QUESTION;

Mr. Katzenbach, you heard our colloquy

19 about mootness in the last case.

Is there not a similarity

20 between this case, in that you've now adopted a regulation
21 that would have permitted this man to come on and distribute
22 leaflets?

23

MR. KATZENBACH:

I don’t believe so, because I

24 don't believe that -- it is clear to me, Mr. Justice
25 Stevens, that the regulations that Princeton now has, which

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

are in the brief, are not consistent with the interpretation

2 of the New Jersey constitution made by the court below.
3

And

I think that’s very obvious.
QUESTION;

4

Well, is that the test?

Or is it if he

5

did precisely the same thing he did here that gave rise to

6

the trespass prosecution, would he now violate your present

7

regulation?
ME. KATZENBACH:

8
9

Yes, because he never even asked

for permission.

10

QUESTION;

I see.

11

MR. KATZENBACH;

And presently the rules still say

12

you must ask for permission.

13

precisely in violation.
QUESTION;

14
15

Your new regulation was a response to

this case, was it not?
MR. KATZENBACH;

16
17

So I think he would still be

Not to the decision, Mr. Chief

Justice.

18

QUESTION;

But to the problem.

19

MR. KATZENBACH;

To the problem, yes.

It was a

20

response to the problem and they decided, for whatever

21

reasons, they decided to at least try a new regulation.

22

the new regulation is, as I say, tougher in some respects,

23

more liberal in others.

24

QUESTION;

25

ME. KATZENBACH;

But

You still require permission.
But it still requires permission.

QUESTION:

6

Why is New Jersey required to respect

7 private property at all, except under the eminent domain
8 clause?
9

ME. KATZENBACH;

I missed a word there, Justice.

10 Required to what?
11

QUESTION:

Respect private -- or set up a system of

12 private property at all, except under the eminent domain
13 clause.
14

MR. KATZENBACH;

Well,

I would suppose that if your

15 suggestion is that the state could -- if it isn't private
16 property, then I assume it is state property.

I don't know

17 what's in between.
18
19 the

QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, assume that there are no --

state does not pass any trespass statutes.

20

MR. KATZENBACH;

21

QUESTION:

It doesn't have to.

That it doesn't provide for any recorder

22 of deeds, and it simply says all hand shall be held in
23 common by the residents of the states.
24

MR.

KATZENBACH;

I would suppose that would be a

25 taking.

4

would be a taking.

5

QUESTIONi

yell, I suppose today at least it

I thought a major part of your argument

6 was that New Jersey's refusal to apply its trespass laws may
7

not violate your property rights, but your free speech

8 rights.

ME. KATZENBACH;

9

That is.

But it's not a refusal,

10

really, Mr. Justice White, to enforce the trespass laws.

11

is saying that somebody has a right to be on our property.

12

We could not even take self-help, is my point.
QUESTIONi

13

But you object to it on grounds, as I

14

understand it, on free speech grounds, not just property

15

rights.
MR. KATZENBACHi

16

W e object to it on both, and I

17

think with one possible exc eption, if we could not prevail

18

on the free speech grounds it would very unlikely be a

19

taking.

And the one except ion is that in Lloyd and Tanner

20 it said if
21

there’s no need to g o on the pro perty then it

would constitute a

taking,

22 since the court found as a

And so to that narrow exten t,
fact that there was no need for

23

communication purposes to g o on the campus of Pri nceton,

24

that that might be a taking

25

But I basically, f undamentally, I believe that it

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

It

1 is a First Amendment right. Justice White, and that is
2 basically what we're arguing.

Where property is, as it is

3 in the case of a university, used for expressive purposes,
4 then for the stats to impose on that property expressive
5 purposes, expressive purposes of others, is to interfere
6 with your expressive rights.
7

I grant the exceptions that can be made to that

8 where the channels of communications are clogged.

Where it

9 is felt necessary for state power to do so, I believe that
10 it can be done.

I have no quarrel with PruneYard.

11 have no quarrel with the prior -- with Marsh.

I would

I would have

12 no quarrel with prior decisions of this Court, even where
13 they have been overruled..
14

QUESTION:

Mr. Katzenbach, can I interrupt again.

15

QUESTION:

You put PruneYard and Marsh together?

16

MR. KATZENBACH:

I put PruneYard and Marsh

17together, Justice Marshall, for only one purpose, sir.

I

18

put them together because in each instance they said we will

19

treat this as though it is public property and the property

2oowner will have the obligations of government with respect
21 to that property, to act neutrally and to have only time,
22 place and manner.

It was for that purpose that I was

23 putting them together.
24
25 rule.

Here the New Jersey court has a totally different
It has a rule where it measures content against

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 content to decide whether it can be said.

It does not say

2 you must admit people on your property to say anything you
3 want.

They say you must admit people on your property to

4 say things that are consistent with your use of the
5 property, and that means consistent with your intellectual
6 use of the property.
7

find they say that deciding what is offensive to

8 your viewws or is not offensive to your views is a problem
9 for the judiciary, it is a problem for the police officers
10 to resolve, and it is not something which it normally would
11 be under a trespass statute, for you to resolve for
12 yourself .
13

QUESTION;

Mr. Katzenbach, it seems to me that

14 you're arguing that the test they propose might lead to
15 situations in which the intruder makes an expression that's
10 offensive to what the University wants to express and
17 thereby offend the University's rights of expression.

But

18 in this particular case, what is the basis for suggesting
19 that what Mr. Schmid did had any conflict whatsoever with
20 any expressive policy of the University?
21

Schmid did or

QUESTION:

The reason the case is here is because

2 if you lose he can go back and do exactly the same thing all
3 over again .
4

MR. KATZENBACH:

5

QUESTION:

And so can anybody else.

And how does that interfere with

6 anything that you want to do with your property, just this
7 limited thing that he's done?
8

MR. KATZENBACH;

If Princeton is restricted, as the

9 New Jersey court says it is, to governmental standards of
10 time, place and manner, and it got that way because
11 Princeton had such an open policy and let people upon the
12 campus, then I assume that that is the only control.

And I

13 think there are situations, as open as Princeton is and as
14

dedicated to those purposes, there are situations on a

15 college campus where unquestionably what is said is highly
Igoffensive to the students and to the members of the faculty
17 and to the other members of the community.
18
19

I believe that for members of the American Nazi
Party to proselytize upon the campus of Princeton would be

2ohighly offensive to the great majority of students there.
21 If somebody on the campus, a student or a member of the
22 faculty, wanted to adopt those views and express them, or
23 even if they wished to invite somebody who did that, I
24 believe that that decision on their part would be respected
25 by other members of the community.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I think that is a very different thing from the

1

2 State of New Jersey saying to Princeton, whether you want to
3 hear him or not, he’s got a right to be here.

4

QUESTION;

Well, Nr. Katzenbach, you said a moment

5 ago if Princeton is to be reduced to the status of a
6 governmental body like New Jersey.

Actually, Princeton is

7 in a sense a creature of New Jersey, is it not?

Doesn't it

8 have a charter?

9

NR. KATZENBACH;

Yes, just as the Dartmouth College

10 did .
11

QUESTION;

Yes.

So that I mean, isn't it in a

12 sense a business or a private institution that is regulated
13 by the laws of the state, subject to any constitutional
14 provisions of the U.S. Constitution that are to the
15 contrary?
16

NR. KATZENBACH;

If I understand you correctly,

17 Justice Rehnquist, you are suggesting that it is in effect
18

no different than a state university.

19

QUESTION;

Yes.

20

NR. KATZENBACH;

And I don't accept that,

21 think that it is different from a state university.
22 not totally regulated by the state.

24 I recollect, this Court said that they had all the rights of

2

QUESTION*

I suppose that if GM has a plant in New

3 Jersey it derives its authority in some way from the state,
4 either as a foreign corporation doing business or a New
5 Jersey corporation.

If so, would they fall under this ban

6 that has been discussed?
7

MR. KATZENBACH:

8

QUESTION*

I would think not.

There are —

In other words, they could say, we’re

9 making automobiles here, not speeches.
10

MR. KATZENBACH*

Yes, but I think we're — yes.

11 And I don’t see -- they would -- if the general public were
12 invited onto the GM premises at various times, under the New
13 Jersey decision then people would have rights to make
14 various speeches there if those rights didn’t interfere with
15 the assembly line and so forth and so on.
16

It is an enormously broad principle that they have

17 adopted by saying every private property owner in the state
18 is subject to some measure -19

QUESTION*

20 the opinion.

I wonder if that's a fair statement of

Isn’t the opinion the equivalent of a New

21 Jersey statute that said in effect, unless a university
22 adopts regulations that contain standards for inviting
23 people to come onto the campus, reasonable standards, then
24 it must allow a certain number of people to come on for a
25 limited purpose?

It doesn't say anybody can come on whenever they
It does say that if you adopt regulations that are

3 reasonable there may be no problem.

4

ME. KATZENBACH;

5

QUESTION;

But time, place and manner only.

Well, I don't know exactly what they

6 mean .

7

MR. KATZENBACH;

That's what they say for

8 Princeton, at least.

9

QUESTION;

Well, they say contain no standards

10 aside from the requirement for invitation.

They say you had

11 no standards whatsoever, and they say in a standardless case
12 You lose, but once you've got standards presumably the court

13 would take a look at the standards.
14

Because the case as it came to them, the only

15 standard, as I understand it, was permission, which is
16 essentially no standard.
17

ME. KATZENBACH;

18

QUESTION;

Right.

Permission plus invitation.
And they say you've got to do

19 something more than that.
20

MR. KATZENBACH;

They said you have to do something

21 more than that.
22

QUESTION;

23

MR. KATZENBACH;

24 more than that?

Right.
Why do you have to do something

What right of who is violated by your not

25 doing something more than that?

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

Well, they say that if you want to

2

operate a university -- say that the legislature passed such

3

a statute that said, until you pass some kind of a

4

regulation you must let people on for reasonable expressive

5

activities.

Would that be an unconstitutional statute?

6

MR. KATZENBACH:

7

QUESTION:

8
9

I believe it would.

I guess you have to be arguing that,

yes.
MR. KATZENBACH:

For two reasons.

I think one is,

10

if your business is expressive activity, then that

11

regulation itself forces you to state what expressive

12

activities you will or will not permit and what your reasons

13

for it are.

14

Amendmen t.

And that seems to me a violation of the First

15

QUESTION:

Tornillo.

16

MR. KATZENBACH:

17

QUESTION:

Yes, to require that.

It’s like saying to a newspaperman that

18

you should be required to put certain kinds of things in

19

your paper.

20

MR. KATZENBACH:

I think it goes that far.

I think

21

it almost says that the more letters to the editor that you

22

print the more you have to print.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Katzenbach, I'd like to ask you

24

about two different areas.

One is, I'm not clear on how

25

Princeton distinguishes the PruneYard case and distinguishes

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 itself from PruneYard, and explain to me what difference it
2 makes that Princeton shops are selling physics and poetry
3 instead of dry goods.
4

Why isn't PruneYard applicable?

MR. KATZENBACH:

Well, let me suggest, Justice

5 O'Connor, I have no problem with PruneYard.

I think

6PruneYard, first, involved a shopping center and no
7 expressive activity, and I think that was quite clear, that
8 the premises had never been used for expressive activity,
9 even though there was some concern by at least some members
10 of the Court in that regard when it came to the expressive
11 activity.
12

Secondly,

the basis for that decision in Justice

13 Newman's court -- in his state court decision was that
14 shopping centers had replaced downtown centers to a
15 dangerous degree,

and that the problems of communicating on

16 political matters with large numbers of people were
17 seriously impaired by the exclusion of those activities from
18 shopping centers.

19

So there was, I think, a compelling state reason

20 for requiring the owners to permit these activities on these
21 premises .
22

And the third reason that I would urge, which is

23 related to it, is that the California court, having made
24 that decision, set a rule which just said all shopping
25 centers, which may be somewhat vague, but all shopping

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SANFORD LEVINSON, ESQ.,

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

1

2

MR. LEVINSON;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

3 the Court;

4

The ultimate constitutional issue in this case is

5 simple;

Whether Princeton University has a federal

6 constitutional right to compel the State of New Jersey to

7 violate its own constitution by applying its criminal law to
8 convict Chris Schmid of criminal trespass in the
9 circumstances of this case.

That is the one judgment before

10 this Court.

11

Princeton University, we begin by arguing, has two

12 obstacles to run before this Court can even reach a decision

13 on the merits.

The first is jurisdictional and I do not

14 propose to take much of your time because you have addressed
15 that issue in your own questions and we’ve briefed it
16 extensively.

17

QUESTION;

Mr. Levinson, do you think that the

18 result of this judgment is that,

and the thrust of it is

19 that Princeton is no longer permitted to keep this person
20 off the campus?
21

Could it use self-help against him?

MR. LEVINSON:

That would certainly be one

22 plausible reading.

23

QUESTION;

So the case involves more than the

24 constitutional right to have New Jersey enforce its trespass
25 statute.

It involves whether or not Princeton may by

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 self-help keep this person off.
2

MR. LEVINSONi

That is a potential issue.

A

3 potential issue is whether New Jersey could sue Schmid
4 subsequently, though I hasten to point out that we do not
5 challenge the existing regulations of Princeton University,
6 and Schmid and his political cohorts have been on the
7 University campus following the rules.

There's no

8 objection.
9

We argue that this case is moot.

But one other way

10 of generating a case would he to file a civil suit against
11 Schmid or someone similar for civil trespass and go back up
12 the New Jersey courts.
13

This is a final judgment from a criminal

14 con victi on.

There are $15 and $10 court costs at stake.

15 Princeton University will not receive the fine.

Indeed, one

16 of the issues of this case is what would happen if the Court

18 counsel's table.

20

The rules have changed.

What is Princeton asking

21 for other than an advisory opinion that at a time three and
22 a half years ago they could do what they have subsequently
23 repudiated?

It's an interesting question, to be sure, but

24 not a question which provokes federal jurisdiction in this
25 Court.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Levinson, they haven't repudiated

2 the position that the man has to ask to come on the campus.
3

MR. LEVINSON:

We don't challenge that, Your

4 Honor.

5

QUESTION:

But they're barred from having such a

6 provision.

7

MR. LEVINSON:

8 are barred,

They are barred from having -- they

presumably.

I confess that were they sue in

9 tort under the old rule of absolutely standardless -- in

10 fact, it's a non-rule.

It said, unless we give you

11 permission, and we will not tell you why we will or will not
12 give you permission, if you are an uninvited stranger you
13 can't get on campus.
14

That was the old so-called rule.

It is true that the most plausible reading of the

15 New Jersey Supreme Court is what Your Honor suggested in
16 questioning to Mr. Katzenbach -17

QUESTION:

Do you know what -- in some cases from

18 state courts when there's been a change of law after a
19 judgment from the state court, we have, not always but
20 sometimes, vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light
21 of the new rule or the new statutory provision.

Why

22 wouldn't that be an appropriate -- we then would -- they

23 could then decide whether or not -24

QUESTION:

These rules were before the judgment,

25 though.

1

HR. LEVINSON:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, sir

These rules were adopted before the

3 judgment.
4

HR. LEVINSON:

The rules were changed prior to the

5determination of the New Jersey Supreme Court.
6

QUESTION:

That's right, they were.

Well then, a

7 fortiori wouldn’t they then reguire or outlaw any
8 requirement that they ask for permission?

They didn't --

9 certainly that rule, that prohibition, would seem to survive
10 the change of the regulation.

11

MR. LEVINSON:

The prohibition — I think it is

12 true that if Princeton had not changed its rules at all, not

13 only would the trespass law not be enforceable, but
14 certainly we would argue that a tort suit would be equally
15 unenforceable.
16
17

But Princeton did change its rules well before the
New Jersey Supreme Court decision, and the New Jersey

18 Supreme Court went out of its way in effect to declare the
19

present New Jersey rules perfectly constitutional under the

20 constitution of New Jersey.

And we do not challenge that.

21 That is not an issue in this case.
22

QUESTION:

Well, I'm not sure they said that.

At

23 least they said that those rules didn't affecet this case
24 because this case arose at a time when there were no rules.
25

MR. LEVINSON:

Yes, sir, that's right, Justice

1 Stevens.
2

But —
QUESTIONi

They didn't really pass on the validity

3 of the new rule.
4

MR. LEVINSONi

They did not legally pass on the

5 validity in the sense of declaring that the rules are
6 constitutional.

But I think the most plausible reading of

7 that particular opinion is that the new rules are precisely
8 the kinds of rules that would pass muster in a proper case.
9

QUESTIONi

So that if the same problem arose again

10 maybe Princeton would win?
11

MR. LEVINSON:

Oh, yes, in New Jersey under the

12 existing rules of Princeton University.

I don't think

13 there's any real doubt about that.
14

We would add one case to this Court’s attention, a

15 case not cited in our briefs.

That is the University of

16 Texas, Regents of the University of Texas System versus New
17 Left Education Project, 414 U.S. at 807, where the
18 University of Texas, in the midst of litigation

about rules

19 quite astonishingly similar to the instant rules, changed
20 the rules.
21

This Court, with only Justice Douglas expressing

22 some reservations, in a one-paragraph opinion ordered the
23 court below to dismiss the case as moot.
24 ought to be followed here.

That precedent

It would dispose of all the

25 issues in the most economic way possible.

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The second obstacle to this case has not been

1

2

addressed by Princeton in their briefs or in oral argument,

3

and that is Flagg Brothers versus Brooks, which we argue

4

would have to be overruled or at least seriously limited in

5

order to reach the merits of this case.
Where is the state action in a state refusing to

Brothers stands for the following propositioni

Chris Schmid was not

encouraged by the State of New Jersey to enter Princeton's

to such private conduct.

23

MB. LEVINSON:

QUESTION;

25

That is the meaning, I believe, of

Pardon me, Your Honor?

I mean, the holding was that it would

stay the hand of the prosecutors in New Jersey from

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 prosecuting Schmid under an ordinance for trespass.
2

MR. LEVINSON:

Yes, sir, that’s correct.

But under

3 Flagg Brothers we would argue that is not the kind of state
4 action which Frinceton can assert, that if this case is

5 properly styled as Princeton University versus Schmid,
6 Princeton University and the State of New Jersey on the
7 Appellant side,

which is the style of this case, what

8 Princeton University must show is state action residing in
9 Appellee Schmid.
10

And there is no such state action.

Perhaps Princeton University has an argument with

11 the State of New Jersey.
12 an argument

Obviously Princeton University has

with the State of New Jersey.

But it would seem

13 that it's precisely the kind of argument held by Brooks with
14 the State of

New York as to whether or not the State of New

15 York could allow the garage in that case to sell the
16 property without first granting a hearing.
17

And this Court held that that was not state

18 action.

Under color of state law, yes.

State action, no.

19 that we feel is a serious problem facing the Court should it
20 reach the merits of this case.
21

In all candor, I might say that Appellee Schmid

22 would endorse the overruling of Flagg Brothers versus Brooks
23 and returning indeed to Logan Valley, because that would
24 make state action what Princeton asks for, the use of
25 coercive state processes to punish a person for exercising

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 free speech rights.
2

We do not argue that if you find state action

3 Schmid loses.

We argue that Schmid wins either way.

But

4 Flagg Brothers must be addressed both by Appellant Princeton
5 and by this Court if their claims on the merits are to be
6 reached at all.
7

In the PruneYard case neither of the parties

8 briefed the issue.

There is one mention of Flagg Brothers

9 in one footnote of an amicus opinion.
10 Court did not address the issue.

And therefore this

It is, we submit, a fresh

11 issue before this Court on what the implications of Flagg
12 Brothers are for cases like this one.
13

We therefore move to the issue on the merits, where

14 we obviously are willing to defend a highly deferential New

15 Jersey state decision, a decision deferential to the
16 interests of Princeton University.

As we point out in our

17 brief and as the amicus brief of the American Association of
18 University Professors points out at length, the New Jersey

19 Supreme Court took full recognition of the legitimate rights
20 of Princeton University.
21

What they correctly found is that Princeton

22 University presented no reason whatsoever to keep Schmid off
23 its campus, and the State of New Jersey has a strong
24 tradition in support of political speech.

That is not only

25 the rational interest, but we would argue if need be the

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 compelling state interest that the state saw.
2

The brief mentions the republican form of

3 government clause.

That is obviously not judicially

4 enforceable by this Court,
5 Borden.

going back to Luther versus

But we would argue that the republican form of

6 government clause points to the essential underpinning of

7 what our system of government is about, which is a free,
8 relatively unrestricted, relatively unstructured public

9 dialogue .
10

And that is what the State of New Jersey, the very

11 state protected, even if not protected by judicial
12 enforcement,

protected in the federal Constitution -- and

13 surely a state supreme court can construe its own state
14 constitution to protect those basic republican institutions
15 of our society.
16 taking full

And that's what they did in this case,

measure of every interest that Princeton

17 University could properly put before it.
18

And thus we argue we would be delighted if this

19 Court reached the merits in spite of the jurisdictional and
20 state action hurdles, because it would seem inconceivable
21 that a state could not act so as to protect the political
22 dialogue .

23

In PruneYard versus Robbins, the United States

24 participated in oral argument before this Court to point out
25 its grave reservation as to the constitutionality of the

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 National Labor Relations Act and the Civil Rights Act of
2 1964 should the shopping center be upheld in that case.
3 Similar issues are present here.
4

What Princeton University argues on page 8 of its

5 reply brief and in oral argument this afternoon is that
6 there is "the right of a private university to determine its
7 educational policy," with educational policy being whatever
8 is defined as such by Princeton or any other university.
9 This point is also made at length in the amicus brief of the
10 American Association of University Professors.
11

What if the policy were to affirm the special

12 authority of white males by hiring only white males to
13 teach?

Indeed, what if in furtherance of some notion of an

14 alleged educational policy Princeton sought to use New
15 Jersey trespass law in the context of attempting to keep out
10 uninvited blacks, though issuing a genuine invitation to all
17 whites and to invited blacks?
18
19

Could New Jersey truly not refuse its aid?

Or does

the Constitution compel the giving over of public power to

2osuch indefensible private ends?
21

The Bob Jones case will be before this Court later

22 in this term and raises serious constitutional issues, for
23 the constitutional issues are those of the free exercise
24 clause.

If Princeton University came before this Court

25 arguing that Presbyterian doctrine forced the policy adopted

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in 1978, that would present a truly challenging question of
2 constitutional law.

That does not raise questions of

3 academic freedom at all, however.

It raises questions of

4 the free exercise of religion, an issue blessedly not before
5 the Court in this case.
6

Neither the holding nor the opinion of the New

7 Jersey Supreme Court reaches as far as Princeton would have
8 us believe.
9 narrow.

The decision of the Court below is extremely

In its holding, after a careful detailed

10 examination of the relationship between Schmid's speech
11 interest and the actual policies in operation at Princeton
12 University, it found Schmid's interest more weighty.
13

To evade recognition of the narrowness of the

14 holding below, Princeton constantly asks this Court in its
15 brief and in its argument to decide cases not before it even
16 as plausible hypotheticals.

On the other hand, all of the

17 arguments put forth in our argument are all too plausible,
18 because Princeton University has not offered and cannot
19 offer a cogent distinction between what it asks for in this
20 case and any future request to be exempt from the most basic
21 statutes found necessary by Congress, state legislatures, or
22 the peoples of the states acting through their constitutive
23 document in order to provide elemental social justice.
24

One final argument must be addressed before my

25 conclusion, and that is the purported use by the court below

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of inadmissible content distinctions.

The court below does

2 distinguish among categories of speech.
3 does this Court.

But so, of course,

For example, political speech versus

4 commercial speech, not to mention offensive speech or
5 obscene speech.
Categorical distinctions, whatever their

6

7 difficulties, are wholly different from genuine content
8 distinctions which say that, for example, within a given

9 category certain speech is acceptable while other speech is
10 not.

One cannot say, for example, that political speech

11 about domestic policy is protected, though debate about
12 foreign policy is not, or that one can only praise but not
13 criticize public policy.

That is the meaning of Brainan and

14 Koseley.
15

But it is far too late in the day to argue that all

16 speech is one undifferentiated whole so that the deceptive

17 huckstering of a commercial salesperson is the
18 constitutional equal of a political address.
19

In summary, then,

this case raises a host of

2ocomplex issues, not the least of them procedural.

These

21 complexities can be most easily avoided through recognizing
22 this as the moot controversy that it is.
23

But my concluding remarks return to the merits,

24 because there Princeton's arguments are not only wrong on
25 the law but profoundly dangerous to the meaning of the

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 United States Constitution.

The decision of the New Jersey

2 Supreme Court does not open up the Princeton campus to those
3 wishing to expound on the merits of their pizzas or used
4 cars, but to Chris Schmid, who wishes to engage his fellow
5 citizens in discourse relating to the polity of which we are
6 all a part.
7
8

It has become the duty of this Court to reject
Princeton's claim of exemption from New Jersey's

9 constitution and to reassert instead the right of the state
10 to assure the preservation of the public discussion that
11 undergirds our republican form of government.

Indeed, this

12 case presents an example of our uniquely federal system at
13 its best.

The fact that the United States Constitution as

14 interpreted by this Court has not been held to provide by
15 its own force access to non-state-controlled property save
16

for company towns does not preclude a state from structuring

17 its laws to afford additional protection for important
18

public values.

19

States are not, to be sure, free to act without

20 limits.

But their willingness to be imaginative and

21 creative in responding to the exigencies of modern life
22 should not be stifled unless constitutionally compelled.
23 There is much to be learned from New Jersey’s and
24 California's -25

QUESTION;

Kr. Levinson, could Congress do the same

1 thing here in the District of Columbia with respect to
2 Georgetown or George Washington or Catholic University?
3

MR. LEVINSON;

If one assumes, as I recall, that

4 the Constitution does give Congress the power to regulate
5 the District of Columbia, I would argue yes.

If Georgetown

6 came before this Court arguing no, the reason would be free
7 exercise, not academic freedom.
8

QUESTION;

George Washington?

9

MR. LEVINSON;

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. LEVINSON;

George Washington, without a doubt.

Without a doubt what?
That Congress could pass a law in

12 behalf of defending the values -13

QUESTION;

Saying that, George Washington, you must

14 allow on your campus certain kinds of speech but you can
15 keep other speech off?
10

MR. LEVINSON;

Yes, you could keep those who wish

17 to sell pizzas or engage in commercial speech off, but
18

Congress could, I think, require George Washington at least,

19 and perhaps at most, to adopt the kinds of rules adopted by
20 Princeton University subsequent to the initiation of this
21 case and de facto upheld by the New Jersey Supreme Court in
22 its decision that is before you, yes.
23

QUESTION;

I'm not sure I tracked you on these

24 illustrations, because there are public streets running
25 through all of the campuses I think that have been

37

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 mentioned.
2

I am not so sure about Georgetown.

But take as a hypothetical a campus which is one

3 square mile, or a half square mile, entirely college
4 property, no public streets; private highways and private
5 sidwewalks running through.

Now this is operated by an

6 order of the Catholic Church.
7

Are you telling us that they must permit people to

8 come on there and make speeches advocating abortion?
9

MB. LEVINSON;

I am stating that the decision on

10 appeal before this Court certainly does not extend that far,
11 because the opinion bends over backward to look at the
12 educational policy of the institution in question.
13

QUESTION;

Then what are you submitting?

14

MR. LEVINSON;

What I am submitting is that the

15 college raised in the hypothetical by Chief Justice Burger
16 could put forth serious free exercise claims that might well
17 lead this Court to say that public power had gone too far.
18

I think it’s only fair to say that in our brief, in

19 some distinction from the brief of amicus the American
20 Association of University Professors, we emphasize the fact
21 that on Princeton’s campus are required to live 3,000
22 registered, potentially registered voting adults.

And if a

23 state found in the hypothetical posed that it was necessary
24 to order such entre onto campus in order to reach registered
25 voters or potentially registered voters, the brief of

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Appellee suggests that that would be defensible.

The brief

2 of amicus American Association of University Professors is,
3 I think it fair to say, somewhat more deferential to the
4 interests of an educational institution per se.
5

QUESTION;

Let me change my hypothetical from the

6 advocacy of abortion to advocacy of Marxism.

7 free exercise.

Eliminate the

Must they allow a Marxist from the Soviet

8 Union to come over and say why we should convert to

9 Marxism?
10

MR. LEVINSON:

A Marxist?

The facts of the case

11 before us deal with someone participating in the American
12 political process, trying to pass out information for
13 candidates.
14

QUESTION:

I was asking the hypothetical question

15 to test your argument.
16

MR. LEVINSON:

If a state legislature or Congress

17 in your initial hypothetical or the people in their

18constitution said that the importance of the free trade in
19 ideas and exposure to diversity that has been emphasized as

20 the root meaning of academic freedom in opinions by this
21 Court over many years, that that commitment to diversity of
22 expression required entre to a private university, yes, sir,
23 I would defend the ability of a state to do that.
24

QUESTION;

And you would say — and I take it you

25 would say if it were -- you would say there would be a

than classical republican ideas, to be heard on this campus

of a university to in effect prevent access to registered

voters by non-Republicans.

I certainly do not think that the university must

teach non-Republican values in its classrooms or even

appoint non-Republicans to the faculty.

MR. LEVINSON:

2

There it seems to me that this

3 Court, over dissent, has emphasized the special nature of
4 military communities and the necessity of members of the
5 armed forces not to be distracted, in effect, by political
6 controversies of the day, which is precisely the opposite of

7 that which one would say about the kind of university
8 depicted, for example, in Justice Powell's opinion in the

9 Bakke case or in every other opinion by this Court that has
10 addressed the meaning of academic freedom.

11

If there are no further questions, then I would

12 submit that the judgment below, if not dismissed, should
13 certainly be affirmed.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS -- REBUTTAL

MR. KATZENBACH:

Just one brief comment, Mr. Chief

I hope that the members of this Court do not think

20 that it is the claim of Princeton University that it can
21 discriminate on race because of educational philosophy or
22 that it can keep people off the campus because of
23 educational philosophy, or that a court cannot inquire in
24 the enforcement of a public policy statute into that issue
25 to determine whether or not it is a genuine question of
