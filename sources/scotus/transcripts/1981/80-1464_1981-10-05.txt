CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

4 of the Interior against the Energy Action Educational
5 Foundation.

Mr. Claiborne, you may proceed when you're ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

9

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

10 the Court;
11

At issue in this case is the federal oil and gas

12 leasing program on the Outer Continental Shelf; that is to
13 say, the zone of the seabed offshore more than three or nine
14 miles of that belt which was conceded to the coastal states
15 in 1953.
16

As the Court knows, beyond that state belt the

17 United States has the exclusive right to exploit the mineral
18 resources of the Shelf.

And since the enactment of the

19 Outer Continental Shelfs Act in

1953 it has done this by

20 granting leases to private oil companies.

21

Those leases are granted, or sold as the term is,

22 at auction on the basis of sealed bids submitted

23 simultaneously for specified tracts within a defined area of
24 the Shelf.

No one knows in advance how many bidders there

25 will be on any particular tract.

In normal course the

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 highest bidder wins that lease.
2

Now, traditionally federal oil and gas leases have

3 resulted in three forms of revenue to the federal government
4 quite beside taxesi

first, the so-called cash bonus, which

5 is paid at the outset for the privilege of the lease#
6 secondly, an annual rental paid for the primary term; and
7 finally, if there is production, a so-called royalty or
8 percentage of the value, the gross value of the minerals
9 actually extracted.
10

Until 1978 the law permitted only two forms of

11 bidding systems for federal lands on the Shelf.

The first

12 was bidding on the amount of the initial bonus, the rental
13 and the royalty being fixed in advance.

The second system

14 was bidding on the royalty rate, in this case the amount of
15 the bonus and the annual rental being fixed in advance.
16

The choice which of these two systems to use was

17 entirely left to the Secretary of the Interior, and for the
18first 20 years, between 1954 and 1974, leases were
19 invariably granted or offered on the basis of the so-called
20 cash bonus system with a fixed royalty of one-sixth.

That

21 is what we refer to as the traditional bidding system;
22 indeed, as I say, it had lasted invariably for 20 years.
23

Beginning in 1974 and for the four ensuing years

24 there were a substantial number of tracts offered under
25variants of that system.

The royalty was sometimes fixed at

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 one-third instead of one-sixth* or it was fixed on a sliding
2 scale, varying between one-sixth and one-half depending on
3 the volume and value of oil or gas extracted during a given
4 quarter; or finally, in a few cases, the leases were offered
5 on the basis of royalty bidding with a fixed bonus per
6 acre.

But the traditional formula, that is, the cash bonus

7 with the one-sixth royalty, remained the norm.
8

However, in 1978, effective in mid-September of

9 that year, the Congress enacted amendments to the Outer
10 Continental Shelf Lands Act, and that is what provoked the
11 present lawsuit.

Most relevantly, the Congress provided for

12 new bidding systems not previously authorized.
13

The question in this case is whether the Secretary

14 of Energy is required under these amendments to promulgate
15 regulations for each of those new authorized bidding
I6systems, and whether the Secretary of the Interior is
17 required to actually use each of those new bidding systems,

18 notwithstanding that both Secretaries may have determined
19 that one or more of those systems is not in the public
20 interest or does not further the statutory objectives.

21

There is also a threshold question.

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. CLAIBORNE;

What were the statutory objections?
The statutory objections were

24 listed as several, Mr. Justice Brennan, but primarily to
25 maximize the revenue to the federal government and to assure

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that production was at its highest level consistent with -2

QUESTION;

Was there also an objective to increase

3 the number of bids per lease?
4

MR. CLAIBORNE:

There was an objective to increase

5 com petition.
6

QUESTION:

There was?

7

MR. CLAIBORNE.-

8

QUESTION;

There was.

And also to decrease the concentration

9 of the leasing?
10

MR. CLAIBORNE:

There was, Mr. Justice Brennan.

11 We suppose that those objectives were intended to further
12 the ultimate objectives of increasing revenues and
13 increasing production consistent with efficient operations,
14 consistent also with environmental concerns which are
15 specified in the law as among the objectives.
16

As I say, there is also a threshold question which

17 is whether the particular plaintiffs in this suit, the
18 respondents before this Court, have standing to complain
19 about the action or nonaction of the two Secretaries, those
20 plaintiffs being the California Lands Commission, which has

21 charge of state leasing on the Shelf, the City of Long
22 Beach, which as a matter of California law has certain
23 privileges with respect to the area adjacent to that city;
24 and secondly, a group of consumer groups and others who
25 claim standing because they're affected by the bidding

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 systems insofar as they affect price and supply of oil.
2

Now, as cases go this one has proceeded fairly

3 swiftly to this Court, but the procedural history is
4 nevertheless too complex to detail in the time available.
5

QUESTION;

Well, does the Government have any

6 doubt that the Court of Appeals, to get by the standing
7 question the Court of Appeals properly reached the matter.
8 Wasn't the only issue there the propriety of issuing that
9 preliminary injunction or not issuing it?
10

MR. CLAIBORNE;

The Government sides with the

11 Court of Appeal in this respect;

the court took the view

12 that since it was reviewing the denial of a preliminary
13 injunction, it plainly had jurisdiction of the case, and
14 that since the issues were pure issues of law,
15 not withstanding the finding of the District Judge that they
16 were disputed issues of fact, the court could, while
17 entertaining the case on the review of the denial of

18 preliminary injunction, reach the other issues in the case,
19 as it did.

20

QUESTION;

The other issues remain whether the

21 District Court should have issued a summary judgment in
22favor of the plaintiffs?

23

MR. CLAIBORNE;

24

QUESTION;

25

MR. CLAIBORNE;

In effect, yes.

Which still has an appeal.
Indeed.

Having the case, having,

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in our view, correctly determined that there were no
2 outstanding issues of fact, considering the statutory
3 injunction to the courts to resolve these controversies
4 without undue delay, the court concluded, it seemed to us
5 fairly, that it ought not remand, direct the entry of one or
6 the other motion and then take an appeal from a final
7 judgment.
8

Now, I couldn't possibly do justice to the

9 complaint in this case.

It is printed in the Appendix and

10 takes some 82 pages, not to mention 45 pages of appendices
11 attached to it.
12

Mr. Justice White has already indicated that the

13 case arises on the second appeal on the denial of cross
14 motions for summary judgment and on the denial of a motion
15 for preliminary injunction.

16

There had been a previous appeal from the denial

17 of another motion for preliminary injunction.
18 originally aimed at a particular lease sale.
19 made to abort that sale.

The suit was
Efforts were

When the sale nevertheless took

20 Place because the District Judge declined to enjoin it, an
21 appeal was taken.

22

That first appeal, resulting in an opinion by the

23 late Judge Leventhal, pointed out, among other things, in
24 denying the appeal that Congress had in this instance
25 imposed a degree of legislative oversight that was perhaps

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 sufficient

to protect the public interest without a need for

2 the court to intervene.

3

On this final appeal from which our petition for

4 certiorari is taken, the Court of Appeal first denied the
5 preliminary injunction but then in most respects held in
6 favor of the respondents before this Court.

At least this

7 much can be said for that decision, which is not in all
8 respects unambiguous:

it directed the Secretary of Energy

9 on a schedule set out by the court to promulgate regulations
10 for at least two of

the optional bidding systems now

11 provided under the amendments.
12

2UESTI0N;

There being how many altogether?

13

HR. CLAIBORNE:

As we compute it, there are ten

14 new systems, not to mention those which could be invented.
15

QUESTION:

In addition to the two originally?

16

HR. CLAIBORNE:

17

QUESTION:

No.

Ten altogether.

Ten altogether.

Nine new ones and plus

18 a catch-all provision which authorizes the Secretaries to
19 devise further permutations, combinations and indeed
20 brand-new systems.
21

The court also directed the Secretary of the

22 Interior to experiment with at least these two systems.

The

23 entire purpose of requiring the Secretary of Energy to
24 promulgate the regulations was that under the statute that
25 is a necessary first step.

The basic holding is that the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Secretary of the Interior must actually experiment with

2 these two systems which do not involve a bidding on
3

5

front-end bonus.
Now, I will turn directly to the merits of the
case, if I may, and draw the Court's attention to the

6 statutory provisions.
7

The relevant provisions are set out

in the Appendix to our brief beginning at page 101a.

If one looks --

QUESTION:

Are you still persisting in your view

of standing?

11

MR. CLAIBORNE:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. CLAIBORNE:

We are, Mr. Justice Stevens.

But you’re not going to argue that one.
Having to choose between the time

14

available and the arguments that seem most important to

15

make, I would rely on our brief which I think fully covers

16

the question of standing.

17

QUESTION:

Your position on standing is that the

18

plaintiffs'

19

fall within the Arlington Heights or Warth v. Seldin.

20
21

interest is sufficiently tenuous that it doesn't

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Exactly so. Justice Rehnquist,

though I would carry it one step further.

22 where their interest lies.

It’s hard to see

The state and the city, so far

23

as we’re aware, are not and have not been leasing their own

24

areas since

25

that they're about to do so now, so that as competitors it's

1968 at the most recent.

There is no indication

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 not easy to see their advantage or their disadvantage from
2 any bidding system the United States may use further
3 offshore .
4

QUESTION:

I take it, Mr. Claiborne, that we

5 disagree with you as to the standing of the state and the
6 city.

We don't have to be concerned with the standing of

7 consumer groups.
8

MR. CLAIBORNE;

I quite agree, Justice Brennan,

9 that if either group has standing, one needn't be concerned
10 about the other group.
11

One more word about California and the city, the

12 thrust of this case is that the federal bidding system
13 discourages most potential bidders because the front-end
14 bonus allows only the largest companies to participate.
15 Logically that should leave a great number of potential
16 bidders who are ready and willing to engage in leasing on
17 the Shelf who therefore could take up state leases if any
18 were offered.

19

None have been offered for more than a decade.

Turning to the merits, if I may, and focusing on

20 the provision of Section 1337 as it's shown at the bottom of
21 page 101a, which is in the statute; it's an amendment to
22 Section 8(a)(1)(1)

23

of the Outer Continental Shelfs Act.

It reads, "The Secretary is authorized to grant to

24 the highest responsible qualified bidder or bidders by
25 competitive bidding, under regulations promulgated in

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 advance, any oil and gas on submerged lands of the outer
2 Continental Shelf which are not covered by, in effect,
3 outstanding leases.
4

When we turn the page and look at the last

5 sentence of that paragraph we see the following language*
6"The bidding shall be by sealed bid and, at the discretion
7 of the Secretary, on the basis of."
8

There follow seven lettered paragraphs describing

9 variant bidding systems; in fact, those seven paragraphs, as
10 we read them, include ten separate bidding systems.

And

11 that, ending with paragraph

(G) on the following page, is

12 followed by the word "or."

And then we have subparagraph

13(H)

which is a provision, a catch-all provision allowing the

14 two Secretaries to devise permutations, combinations or new
15 systems.
16

Now, if the matter ended there it would be indeed

17 very strained to argue that
18 that "at the discretion of

"authorized" meant directed,
the Secretary" meant that he had

19 no choice which system to use,
20 should be read as

21
22 and

and that the connective "or"

"and."

Unfortunately, we know that resourceful lawyers
resourceful courts sometimes read language not quite so

23 literally as I've suggested, and it is conceivable that if
24 the statute ended there a court

might reasonably take the

25 view that if the Secretaries declined to experiment with any

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of the new systems included

in these amendments, that would

2 amount to an abuse of discretion.

Even then we would argue that Congress had merely

3

4 widened the

choice available to the Secretaries, had removed

5 the shackles of the original statute,
6 Secretaries

had nudged, goaded the

to experiment, but that at the end of the day

7 they would remain free, if they concluded after
8 investigation
9 not

that the public interest would not be served,

to use such systems.

10

Congress might have been disappointed, but it

11 would have been free,
12 mandate

to the administrators.

13 themselves resolved
14

17 enjoy.

But in fact, the amendments

this matter.

When we look at the critical section on page 104a,

15 which is Section
16 limit on

as it is now, to issue a clearer

(5)(B), we see that the statute has put a

the exercise of the discretion the two Secretaries
It has told them that for the next five years at

18 least 20 percent but not more than 60 percent of the acreage
19 offered must be offered under bidding systems other than the
20 traditional one,
21

the traditional one being

(A) in this list.

Even then there's an escape hatch which allows the

22 Secretary to conclude that following that requirement is not
23 furthering the statutory policies and objectives, but that
24 is no doubt a matter which requires a heavy justification.
25 In any event,

it’s a provision which the Secretary has not

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 invoked
2

So in principle the limits on the discretion of

3 the administrators of the program has been defined.
4 been defined as follows.

It has

For at least 40 percent and up to

5 80 percent of the acreage offered each year the traditional
6 bidding system must be used.

And on the other hand, for at

7 least 20 percent and up to 60 percent of the acreage the
8 alternative systems must be invoked.
9

Now, the natural inference from this specific

10 provision qualifying the Secretary's discretion is that in
11 all other respects they are free to do as they think best.
12

Now, it seems to be argued, notwithstanding this,

13 that the provision which I have just adverted to,

(5)(B),

14 because it says "The bidding systems authorized shall be
15 used in the following percentages," that this means each and
16 every one of them.
17

Now, respondents don't seem to have the courage of

18 their convictions, nor did the Court of Appeal.

They seem

19 to be ready to excuse the Secretaries from using some of the
20 bidding systems that have been newly authorized.

That's no

21 doubt because it would be extreme indeed to say that each
22 year the Secretary must resort to ten different systems,
23 each with many variations possible, not to mention devising
24 new systems under paragraph

25

QUESTION:

(H).

Do you still say, Mr. Claiborne, that

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 even if the systems now being employed didn't appreciably
2 increase the number of bids per lease and decrease the
3 concentration of the leasing market that nevertheless the
4 Secretaries would have no obligation under the 1978
5 provision to employ other systems?
6

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Justice Brennan, they

7 certainly have an obligation to consider whether resorting
8 to systems not yet used would have such an effect; but if
9 they should conclude that that statutory objective of
10 furthering competition —
11

QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting then that at

12 least if that condition obtained they would have to consider
13 whether or not other alternatives should be used?
14

MR. CLAIBORNE:

15 considered.

But, Justice Brennan, they have

They have considered fully, and they have

16 stated their reasons to the Congress for concluding that two
17 of these systems would not produce the desired effect and
18would carry

substantial disadvantages.

19 the hand approach

20 Indeed,

It is not a back of

to we will not look at these new systems.

the Secretary of Energy under compulsion of court

21 order has issued regulations for these two systems mostly in
22 dispute,

but he has done so with reservations, and the

23 Secretary of the Interior has concluded

after study and

24 after consulting with his best experts,

and after

25 experimenting with

those ingredients in other ways that they

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 will not produce the desired results.
2

QUESTION;

Which of the Secretaries has concluded

3 this?
4

MR. CLAIBORNE;

The Secretary of the Interior.

5 But the Secretary of Energy in promulgating the regulations
6 has also indicated his grave misgivings about the beneficial
7 consequences of resorting to net profit share.
8

QUESTION;

Well, has either concluded that the

9 alternatives now being used sufficiently deconcentrate the
10 leasing market without resort to others?
11

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I think the fair statement is that

12 the Secretary of the Interior has concluded that very little
13 can be done by way of changing bidding systems that will
14 have much of an effect on the concentration.
15

Concentration may be slightly overstated because

16 there is the possibility and there is a reality of joint
17 ventures where smaller firms can join together; the larger
18 ones may not.

But what deters the smaller firms is the

19 enormous costs quite outside of any bonus,

and the enormous

20 risks, especially now that we are dealing with frontier
21 areas.

And in those circumstances smaller companies are

22 simply -- are unlikely to be in a position to actively
23 participate in this offshore leasing.
24

The Secretary has taken the view that by enlarging

25 the areas available he may make it more possible for other

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 firms not presently engaged to have their opportunity to
2 participate .
3

But this question of whether the Secretaries must

4 test each alternative is in fact resolved by the statute
5itself.

When we look at Section 8(a)(9), which is on the

6 same page, we notice a reporting requirement which requires
7 the Secretary of Energy in consultation with the Secretary
8 of the Interior to report annually to Congress, in the words
9 of the statute, "the reason why a particular bidding system
10 has not been or will not be utilized," suggesting obviously
11 that that may be the case and that the Secretaries are
12 entitled to come to that conclusion.

Congress may look

13again at their reasons and determine that they’re not
14 satisfactory and amend the statute further.
15

There is a similar provision which appears on the

16last page of the brief, another report which again requires
17 the Secretary of the Interior this time to explain the
18reasons why a particular bidding system has not been
19 utilized.
20

QUESTION:

I gather your reliance on 9(D) suggests

21 that if we accept it, that’s the end of the case, isn't it?

22

MB. CLAIBORNE:

I would say so, Mr. Justice

23 Brennan .
24

In our view the text is perfectly clear.

It

25 resolves any ambiguity there may be in the legislative

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 history.

What it seems to come to is this*

that some

2 members of the Congress were probably persuaded or at least
3 half persuaded, perhaps by the respondents who were very
4 active in the legislative process, that net profit share was
5a promising alternative.

Others may have been persuaded

6 that work commitment was a promising alternative.
7 preferred a different formula.

Others

Some members may have been

8 in favor of compelling the Secretary to adopt their pet
9 system, though surprisingly there is no one who
10unambiguously says so during the legislative debates.

Many

11 were in favor of widening the options but leaving the
12 Secretaries free to make their own decision.
13

Not unusually, these extreme views were either

14 compromised or merged in a wider consensus, a middle
15 position which is reflected in the enacted statute; that is,
16 that some experimentation was indeed mandated, short of a
17very strong finding by the Secretaries that that would not
18 be in the public interest.

But which new alternatives

igshould be tested for those experiments was a matter left to
20the administrators of the program.

21

Now, that's hardly a surprising conclusion.

The

22advantages and disadvantages of each bidding system are not
23 easily appraised by laymen or by lawyers or by judges.

When

24 one reads the joint appendix in this case, it seems more
25 addressed to a specialized tribunal of experts than it does

Economists on both sides have exhausted themselves

QUESTION*

How often are the reports required?

15

MR. CLAIBORNE:

At the end of each fiscal year.

16 Several reports.
17

QUESTION:

And do they go directly to committees

18or do they go generally to the Congress?

MR. CLAIBORNE:

I think they're addressed to the

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. SILARD;

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please

3 the Court;
I'm glad the Government now concedes that the
5 gen
general
eral section giving discretion to the Secretary in the
6 mat
matter
ter of choosing which system to use, which he read,

is

7 not goi
going to be applicable for two more years, because we
8 are now in the five-year period where it is Section
998(a)(5)(B)
which controls, not the general discussion.
8 (a ) ( 5)
10

When this full and fair experimentation required

11 by this section is completed after five years, the Secretary
12 in his informed discretion will be able to choose which
13 systems
sys terns to use where.

But the point is that in Section

148(a)(5)(B)
14 8 (a ) ( 5 )
in each of the five years in which we are now,
15 the Sec
Secretary was commanded to use these systems; it says,
"Th e sy:
16”The
systems herein shall be applied."
16
zealot
lot for plain meaning, but it says,

Now, I’m not a
"The systems shall be

18applied,"
and it doesn't say some of them, or one of them,
18 app lied
19 or two i

them.

So I start with the language of the statute, and I

insist
ist that it does not at all clearly repel the contention

QUESTION;

Well,

Mr. Silard, what do you do with

24 9 (D )?
25

MR. SILARD;

I will come to it in a moment, Your

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Honor.

That’s an annual provision.

2

QUESTION:

It doesn't imply --

No, but doesn't this have some

3 interconnection with 5(B)?
4

HR. SILARD:

It does, but I think that’s an annual

5-- there's no implication there that the Secretary can cast
6 out completely for the whole five-year period not only one
7 system but all three of the nonbonus systems.
8

QUESTION:

9 applicable,

Well, it does say, though,

"if

the reason why a particular bidding system has

10 not been or will not be utilized."

There's no suggestion

11 that there's any exception for those within the five years.
12

MR.

SILARD:

The reporting of that on an annual

13 basis is the one best inference the Government has, but I
14 think the material I'm going to give you will show you to be
15 erroneous.
16

There are eight separate times in the legislative

17 history where three times the Senate, three times the House,
18 and twice the conference committee said these systems shall
19 be used, which is consonant with the language "will be
20 used."

I’m going to touch on them very briefly, because

21 they are in our opinion dispositive, before we get to the
22 purpose of the statute which is being totally frustrated
23 here by the use of the systems that are least likely to
24 advance competition and revenues.

25

First of all, the Senate committee said -- and

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2 "authorizes" -3

QUESTION*

What page did you say, Mr. Silard?

4

MB. SILARD;

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. SILARD;

Page 15.
Thank you.
The bill "authorizes new leasing

7 systems and requires their use on an experimental basis."
8 Later on in the same page it says that "In order to assure
9 that these alternatives will be used," -- assure that they
10 will be used -- the parameters are placed in the statute.
11

On page 16 the committee concludes again with

12 respect to those parameters that these limitations are
13 included to assure that the new leasing systems would be
14 tried.
15

So the Senate was perfectly clear, but the House --

16

QUESTION;

Mr. Silard, that’s just as clear as the

17 statute in the sense that the words "the bidding systems" as

18 you read them mean all of the bidding systems or each of the
19 bidding systems.

20

MR. SILARD:

21

QUESTION:

Right.

Well, we come —

You do in effect say "the bidding

22 systems" means all of them.
23

MR. SILARD:

Well, it's clear at least it includes

24 some of the nonbonus systems.

That becomes clear from the

25 next three citations.

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

But just those that you've read so far

2 in the statutory language doesn't distinguish between bonus
3 and nonbonus.
4

MR. SILARD;

Perhaps it implies not all, but now

5 take a look at what —
6

QUESTION;

Well, what is your view?

Is it all or

7 less than all?
8

MR. SHARD;

Well, I would say the fairest reading

9 is it's all, but the case doesn't turn on that.
10 turns on this issue;
11 alternatives?
12

The case

can he totally reject the nonbonus

And that's what it makes clear.

QUESTION;

Well, do you read the statute as

13 requiring that all of them be used?
14

MR. SILARD;

I have two arguments.

One, I think

15 y es.
16

QUESTION;

Well, I’m just interested in your

17 position.
18

MR. SILARD;

Yes.

I would say initially yes, but

19 if no, as an alternative at least some of the nonbonus
20 systems have to be used because the committees expressly
21 said so, if I may read the citation. Your Honor, addressing

22 this.
23

On page 18, "It was the intention of the committee

24 that there be a clear mandate given to the Secretary to
25 require him to use bidding systems other than the cash bonus

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 bid."
2

And by that they meant that he had to use some of

3 the non-cash bonus systems, because two paragraphs later,
4 still on page 18, they say by random selection "of those
5 areas to be off ered under a bonus bid system and those which
6 would be offered under a nonbonus bid system," the purpose
7 would be advanced.

And they finish up again saying this is

8a "mandating use of new systems, to insure they are tested
9 and studied."
10

I want to make an apology.

On page 19 I forgot to

11 give a very
:y important additional reference from the
12 Conference RReport.

It says

the following:

"Although there is no

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 requirement for random selection" -- this is page 19 of our
2 brief -- "the Secretary, in setting forth systems for use
3 ...shall seek to secure a fair selection of different
4 methods on different tracts.

The purpose of such a

5 selection is to assure that adequate information is obtained
6 as to relative advantages and disadvantages of the various
7 bidding systems, including the front-end bonus bid systems."
8

Now, the way the Government reads this. Congress

9 might just as well have put the word "only" in here,
10 including only the front-end bonus bid systems, because
11 that’s how they are reading this statute.

And yet to insert

12 the word "only" including the front-end bonus bid systems is
13 to invert the meaning of this completely.

The very point

14 that Congress is making and the House committee was making
15 was we want to compare the benefits of the nonbonus bidding
16 systems where this big cash barrier which has prevented
17 competition and returns to the United States for 25 years
18 has become the problem.

Let's see how those work which

19continued to use that in some fashion, and compare them to
20 those that don't use that in any fashion.

21

That was the whole point, and it’s been totally

22 destroyed by the reluctance of the Secretary.

23

QUESTION*

24 your position.

Hr. Silard, I want to be sure about

Did I understand you to say that you rest

25 your entire case on the selection on page 19 of your brief?

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. SILARDs

1

No.

I rest my entire reading of the

2 legislative references on the mandate to experiment on
3

this.

My entire case. Your Honor, rests on a completely

4

different proposition which was invoked against this very

5

agency this year earlier in this Court's decision written by

6 Powell.

This Court has never consciously construed a

7
8

statute in a way as it's being asked to be construed by the

9 Government here which totally frustrates its central
10 purpose.

That frustration of its central purpose is clear.

11

On page 16 of our brief and on page 17 of our

12 brief and on page

15 we quote the central purpose from the

13

legislative reports.

The Senate said the new systems are

14

designed to reduce the front-end cash bonus --

15

QUESTIONS

Where are you reading, Mr. Silard?

16

MR. SILARD*

17

The Senate report said that the experiment is

Middle of page 15.

18

designed to reduce the front-end cash bonus and increase the

19

Government's return on actual production.
The House, on page 17, said almost exactly the

20

21 same thing:
22 and
23
24
25

"To increase competition for offshore leases

secure higher returns to the public Treasury," the

section has been amended, et cetera.
So the whole point of the experiment was can we
use systems where there will be more competition.

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Now, there are five GAO reports that are in the

1

2 Appendix to our brief,

3

QUESTION;

all issued between *73 and '78.

Now, the language you just relied upon

4 is followed by language, "has been amended to allow," "to
5 allow the Secretary."

Does that mean to compel the

6 Secretary ?

7

HR. SILARDs

Well, the following sentence says,

8 "The Secretary is required

9

to choose the new bidding system."

So I don't think the language is the answer.

The

10 answer is the purpose of the statute is controlling here.

11
12

13

QUESTION;

But this is legislative history, not

statutory language, as I understand it.
MR. SILARD;

I'm saying that the purpose of the

14 Congress has never been clearer than in these amendments.
15 Over and over again the reports say that front-end cash
16 bonus prevents adequate competition.

The five GAO reports

17 which are in the record and which are cited by the
18 Congressional committees all said we have too few bids under
19 these cash bonuses -- we have like two and three bids per
20 tract over the last
21

22

25 years — to know that we're getting a

fair return .
No one knows how much this gas and oil is worth;

23 so unless we have active competition for the bids, we have
24 no assurance at all the government is getting anything like
25 their fair return.
That was the central purpose here;

more bidding

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 by our system which will guarantee better return if it's a
2 cash bonus system, or better returns through high royalties
3 and profit shares such as California gets if we use that
4 other system.
5

Now, it’s totally frustrated by what’s happened.

6 Appendix A to our brief shows that in the last three years
7 the exclusive use of variance of bonus bidding has produced
8 no advance whatever in the competition and revenue
9 objectives of the statute.
10

But you need not take it from me.

I have lodged

11 with the Clerk of this Court the answer to three
12 Congressional questions given by the Secretary three weeks
13 ago.

And in his answers to Jones and Hubbard question 7 --

14 those are Congressmen — and Lent and Forsythe question 14,
15 and his answer to Lent and Forsythe question 15, the
16 Secretary three times says the new systems we tried are a
17 failure.

They have not promoted competition.

18 reduction of the bonuses.
19

There is no

We've had no gain at all.

So I think a more candid answer that the Solictor

20 General may have made is that the Secretary now says we have
21 gotten nowhere, which is also clear from Appendix A, over
22 the last three years by using the bonus bidding varieties.
23And that’s obvious.
24

The whole problem that Congress was addressing was

25 these big bonuses prevent an adequate number of bidders, and

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 with so few bids we don't know that we're getting a market
2 in which we're getting a fair return.
3

When you continue to reject the nonbonus three

4 options that Congress specified and use only the bonus
5 options Congress specified, you have debilitated yourself
6 from the fair experiment which was intended to compare one
7 system against the other.

You get no results, as the

8 Secretary now concedes, you get no gain whatever, and you
9 won *t use a system which California has used for 30 years
10 with good effect and seems to do exactly what Congress
11 wanted to do, and it was one of the systems in here.

12

Now —

13

QUESTION;

Do you plan to rest your standing

14 contentions as to Warth and Simon v. Eastern Kentucky on
15 your brief, as did the Government?
16
17 this.

MR. SILARD:

Yes, Your Honor, except I wish to say

If there is one issue that is not before you with any

18 problem in it it's the standing issue.

Congress said the

19 principal problem with what we're doing now is it doesn't
20 get enough bids and enough revenue.

Let's try new systems,

21 must try new systems, in our view, which give a promise of
22 more bids, more competition and more revenue.

23

Those are the goals I just read from the statute.

24 No question about it.
25

Now, in the frustration of that goal by the

29

And when the five-year experimental period ends, and this is

So

1 intended.

In other words --

2

QUESTION*

Mr. Silard, may I ask you --

3

MR. SILARD *

4

The Congressional objective, Your Honor, the

May I just finish the thought?

5 principle Congressional objective to increase leasing
6 revenues is one in which California as a co-partner has a
7 most obvious stake which gives it standing.
8

QUESTION*

It isn't clear, is it, whether even if

9 California were to win here that the Secretary would be
10 likely to use the bidding systems that California prefers on
11 the pools that California shares with the federal
12 government?

In other words, since the Secretary would still

13 be free to have other experiments, how is it clear that
14 California in that way would have standing?
15

MR. SILARD*

That argument. Your Honor, is

16 essentially a refusal to accept the premise on which
17 Congress enacted the statute.

The Congress said let's test

18 these systems to find the one that will give us the best
19 revenue, the assumption being that we have good faith

20 experimentation that gives us the answer to that; a sane
21 Secretary of the Interior not dominated by oil company
22 considerations will use the systems that maximize revenue.
23That's the whole point.

24

So I think to say that an ornery Secretary could

25do this experimentation, discover, as California has

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 discover ed,

that profit-sharing gets much better results

2 than the cash bonus system,

but then just guixotically say

3 well, in the next 30 years I don’t like that system; I’m not
4 going to use it.
5

I cannot say that it is impossible that if this

6 experiment were conducted and succeeded a Secretary

might

That might be an

10 whole premise for the experimental program,
11 Secretaries
12 successful

that we have

who are intelligent men who will use a
experiment and then use the best of the systems

13 that yield the best revenue.
14

So Congress is assuming that the function of this

15 five-year experimentation is to give the Secretary an
16 informed discretion at the end of the five years to use the
17 best system.

And I think we have to assume a very high

18 likelihood that if he does what Congress mandated and
19 clearly wanted to do here, and the California system proves
20 as effective in use here as it does for California,
21 all likelihood he

will then use that system then, perhaps

22 not on every sale but on a substantial number of sales.

QUESTIONs

Mr. Silard, may I interrupt you right

When was the last time California engaged in

6 co-leasing?
7

MR. SILARD;

This co-leasing, Your Honor, took

8 place this summer, and two years ago, and next year.
9 an involuntary co-leasing.

It's

Under the statute where there's

10a drainage situation and the federal government owns one
11 side of the pool on one side of the three-mile line and
12 California on the other, California must accept a portion of
13 the federal lease revenues as its share for its own oil
14 which is being pumped out.
15

Now, if it cannot agree on how much it should get,

16 then the federal district court is to decide what the fair
17 share is.

But the point is the pie which is being split

18 could be, as Congress anticipated, a much better pie, not

igonly for the federal government and the state of California,
20 if, as Congress anticipated, we would use the systems which
21 give promise of more competition and more returns.
22

QUESTION:

Did I understand Mr. Claiborne to say

23 that California had not participated since 1968?
24

MR. SILARD:

No.

He said California has not gone

25 heavily into leasing its own new leases.

It's pumping oil

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 now from leases in ’48, '50 and '68.
2

QUESTION;

But it has participated in revenues as

3a co-leaser in the past.
4

MR. SILARDs

Oh, under this federal statute it has

5a legal interest in the federal revenues because it's an
6 involuntary participant and shares in them.

If that's not a

7 legal interest that entitles it to say Mr. Secretary, you
8 must carry through the experimentation which Congress hoped
9 would increase these revenues both for the federal
10 government and for us, I don't know what it is.

And I may

11 say it's not small potatoes.
12

QUESTION;

May I interrupt just to --

13

MR. SILARDs

There's a billion dollars on deposit

14 for California from just these last two drainage sales.

I

15 found that in a collection of responses that the Solictor
16 General lodged with the Clerk of this Court made three weeks
17 ago by the Secretary to the Congress.

18

QUESTION;

In these situations where a joint pool,

19 California and the federal pool, is leased, does California
20 participate in the division of the front-end bonus?

21

MR. SILARDs

Whatever the revenues are, whatever

22Comes in, California divides.
23

QUESTION;

At the time the bonus is paid, say the

24drilling is unsuccessful and they don't produce anything,
25 does California still get a share of this?

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. SILARDi

Certainly, but that's exactly the

2 kind of penny-wise, pound-foolish policy that Congress found
3 that after 25 years was minimizing real federal revenues,
4 because when there's a big discovery and the federal
5 government gets 12 percent or 16 percent of the revenue,
6 whereas California, for instance, gets 48 percent net share
7 of the revenue, it's just a terrible deal.
8

Of course, every administration wants that cash up

9 front to balance this year's or last year's budget.

I

10 understand why administration after administration has
11 refused to do what Congress wants, made very clear.

Let's

12 get the total revenue in here, even if it's down the line;
I3then it's a fair share.

They want the cash up front, some

14other administration they don't care much about.

But

15Congress was —
16

QUESTION:

If it's so clear, why do you suppose no

17 disappointed bidders have joined your litigation?
18

MR. SILARD:

I suppose, one, because they have

19 confidence that our litigation would succeed without their

20 presence .
21

( Laughter. )

22

There's a certain immodesty in that, but I will

23 say that --

24

( Laughter. )

25

I will say that a unanimous Court of Appeals found

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 what I am arguing, that the central purpose of this statute
2 is being frustrated by the refusal to use any of the three
3 nonbonus bid systems.
4

QUESTION;

It is surprising that there are no oil

5 companies that share your view.
6

MR. SILARD;

Oh, there are.

We've had letters

7 from oil companies.
8

QUESTION;

No.

I mean as far as the record

9 discloses.
10

MR. SILARD;

Well, there are oil companies,

11 certainly gas companies.

A lot of them testified in the

12 Congressional hearings that this front-end bonus is the
13 whole problem, and Congress accepted it; that if we had a
14 looser system -- and by the way, the gas companies do get
15 into the bidding when they're not precluded by the cash
16 bonus.

Alaska tried profit share bidding only last year,

17 and the gas companies were there and there were good results
18 in Alaska.

19

So this is a system that can work.
QUESTION;

Does the record tell us the relative

20 front-end cost of, a) the bonus — I don't know how big
21 these bonuses -- say you had a million dollar bonus.

What

22 would the front-end cost in exploration and drilling be to
23 find out whether there is oil really there?
24

MR. SILARD:

25

QUESTION;

No one —
Do we know the relative significance of

2

MR. SILARD:

On the drilling costs and exploration

3 costs no one has factors, but we do have in the record I
4 think what is partially the answer to your question, Mr.
5 Justice Stevens.
6

What happened was that in the sixties few leases

7 were let, prices were stable, and the property that was
8 being let was relatively known or there was a pretty good
9 hunch as to what was there.

The result was that the

10 Government realized about 35 percent -- this is all in the
11 record -- 35 percent net of the gas and oil that was
12 discovered with a combination of the cash bonus and the 16
13 percent royalty.

In other words, the 16 percent royalty

14 represen ted about half of the income and the cash bonus
15 about the other half.
16

What happened since is in the seventies we started

17 going into less known properties, we started selling a lot
18 more of it, and the result was that the competition level

igwent down further; but the really important result was that
20 the cash bonuses, while they kept going up with inflation
21 and all, started losing significance vis-a-vis the net
22result in a radical way.

So that as of the last three years

23 in the seventies, the cash bonus was adding only 6 percent
24 to the 16 percent royalty.

We were now getting -- the

25 federal government has been getting 22 percent —

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Silard, doesn't that go back

3 to the standing question, that there are so many independent
4 acts following between the bidding and the production that
5 you, like in Simon, you simply can't trace accurately one to
6 the other?
7
8 reason.

MR. SILARD;

No, Your Honor, I hope not for this

The issue here isn't what the oil companies are

9 doing or not doing.

The issue is this:

the Secretary was

10 commanded to experiment with a system that would maximize
11 revenue, and he's not doing so.

They concede that was the

12 purpose.
13

The state of California has an intimate legal

14 interest in the success of that mandated experiment, because
15 its revenues, if the government now uses a different leasing
16 system which does show a better result -- for instance,
17 California's own system — its stake is in a vast increase

18 in its share of the federal revenues by the use of the new
19 system.

20

That doesn't depend on what oil companies do.
The hundred dollar question is simply this;

when

21 you have a substance of almost unknown but potentially vast
22 riches, gas and oil under the ocean, isn't it sensible to
23 relate the government's and California’s stake in what comes
24 out of there fairly directly to the gas and oil that's
25 discovered,

instead of putting everything in an upfront,

1 blind man's gamble upfront where very few high bidders, high
2 rollers can play the game,

very few play the game, and the

3 net result is a devastating loss in competition and in
4 revenues.
5

I would like to conclude on this score. Your Honor.

6

QUESTION;

Mr. Silard, I take it that absent the

7 legislative history to which you have referred that you
8 would agree that the statute on its face doesn’t require the
9 Secretary to use each one of those alternatives.
10

MR. SILARD;

Not at all. Your Honor.

I would

11 argue that the words "shall be applied" are words of common
12 English meaning.
13

QUESTION;

14 on its face

15

So you're position is that the statute

requires.

MR. SILARD;

Absolutely.

The words "shall be

QUESTION:

MR. SILARD;

Kell, certainly the legislative

22 nonbonus ones because that was the history

MR. SILARD;

Now, just stick to my question.
Yes, I would say first the

There are lots of leases each year.

You've got

2 to make some test of each of these six systems.
3

QUESTION;

So you're saying your front-end

4 argument is —
5

NR. SILARD;

Right.

If I lose — I don't have to

6 win -7

QUESTION;

The statute on its face means use every

8 one of them» the legislative history means use every one of
9 them.
10

MR. SILARD;

Yes.

Alternatively.

The legislative

11 history makes clear that at the very least he must use some

12 of the nonbonus systems, because otherwise the whole purpose
13 they stated, to compare one against the other, can't be met.
14

QUESTION;

15 have it both ways.

Well, I know, but I'm not sure you can
Suppose the statute doesn't mean on its

16 face that the Secretary has to use each one of them.
17

MR. SILARD;

Yes, I'm willing to concede that it

18 doesn't mean that, but it would still mean that since the
19 ultimate purpose was to test the systems that can promote
20 competition and revenue, and it is even conceded by the
21 Secretary that all these variants of bonus bidding haven't
22 achieved that —

23

QUESTION;

So you would say that the statute must

24 be construed or applied just as though it said on its face
25"but remember, Mr. Secretary, you must use some of the

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 non-cash bonus systems."
2

MR. SILARD:

Well, if I were Your Honor addressed

3 by this question, I would find it unnecessary to address the
4 question whether the Secretary in the five years must use
5 all six systems, because it's enough -- and that's what our
6 complaint is about here, Your Honor -- that he won't use any
7 of the non-bonus bidding systems.

And this legislative

8 history and the purpose of the statute are both so clear
9 that against that kind of a result, this Court -- I won't
10 read it, partly because I've lost it and partly because my
11 eyesight is bad -- but the most wonderful sentence from
12 Judge Learned Hand which was quoted against this very agency
13 by this Court in its decision earlier this year bears
14 recollection.
15

I think I did find it and my eyeglasses

16 notwithstanding, I will read just one sentence that Justice
17Powell quoted against this department in Watt against Alaska
18 this year when he said, "It must be remembered that statutes

igalways have some purpose or object to accomplish whose
20sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to
21 their meaning."

22

Now, I think the object of this statute is crystal

23 clear from the history:

test the systems that will give us

24 more competition and more revenue.

The frustration of that

25object is clear from Appendix A to our brief and from the

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 three quotations which I've left with the Clerk to be lodged
2 with the Court, make clear that it's just been knocked into
3 the wastebasket and we're getting no progress.
4

QUESTION:

Do you suggest that Congress is unaware

5 of all these problems?
6

MR. SILARD:

No, but Congress has been also

7 watching this lawsuit and knew as of last fall that the
8 Court of Appeals had ruled that we are right, and I think
9 hopes, as I hope, that this Court will agree with the Court
10 of Appeals that the frustration of the underlying purpose of
11 the statute is so clear here, never mind the specific
12 history which I've read, that the Secretary should be
13 required in the remaining two years -- and this is an
14 emergent matter -- to make some, some experimental resort to
l5some of the nonbonus systems.

That's the only way to carry

16 through the underlying objective of this statute, because
17the ridiculous situation is that Congress identified the

18 cash bonus as a problem, said you shall experiment with
19 three cash bonus and three non-cash bonus systems.

The

20 Secretary in an ornery fashion insists on trying those

21 systems least likely to solve the problem, because they
22still use the cash bonus, and all of a sudden suggests that
23 the other one is somehow a terrible system that cannot be

24 used.
25

The one rationale he gives for not using the

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 California system which has been so successful in effect is
2 that there may be underproduction.

But in Section 8(a)(3)

3 Congress already addressed that very point, and on page 35
4 of our brief we quote the legislative history where it says
5 to solve the problem of possible underproduction on the very
6 high profit share bids as the lease starts yielding less oil
7 and gas, the Secretary can reduce or remove the profit share
8 completely.

So Congress actually already addressed the

9 complaint the Secretary is making about using or testing the
10 California leasing system.
11

We live in a world where there are theories and

12 realities.

The reality is that almost the biggest state of

13 this union for 30 years has had successful resort to the
14 profit share system, which is the one Congress most hoped
15 would turn the trick for the federal government, which is
16 the one that the Secretary absolutely refuses to test, and
17 by so doing, in our opinion, if we may submit, it is
18 frustrating not only the great public policy which was
19 achieved at great agony in the Congress after two successive
20 efforts and after 25 years of patience, after 25 years

21 Congress said all this discretion has to end;

we're going to

22 test for five years in a meaningful way to compare this
23 system with

that system.

24 apples with apples,

Well, the Secretary is comparing

whereas Congress said compare the apples

25 with the oranges.

Your Honors, that the Court's decision be that the

And unless the Court has any further questions of

8 hope

I think I will probably rest on Judge Learned Hand and
that this Court will give a reading to this statute

9 which gives vitality to what Congress wanted and made clear,
10

rather than one which defeats the obvious intent of the

11

Congress to give a new lice on leafing -- a new life to

12

leasing — that pays me back for trying puns at the end of

13 an argument

— but it was to be new life to leasing that was

14 to be given,

and it is being killed by the Secretary's

15 absolute refusal to

test the nonbonus bidding system.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT BY LOUIS F. CLAIBORNE, ESQ.,

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

20

MR. CLAIBORNE:

21
22 Justice

Mr. Chief Justice, in answer to

Stevens' question concerning the relative importance

23 of the bonus as compared
24 Court's

Do you have anything

to the development cost, I draw the

attention to one of the responses filed, lodged with

25 the Court.

It's a document which represents the responses

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of Secretary Watt to questions asked at the most recent
2 oversight hearings in June.
3 September 14 of this year.

That response is dated
And particularly on page 38 and

4 on page 39 of that document there are two answers to
5 questions by Congressman Lowry specifically addressed to the
6 deterrent effect of the cash bonus as compared to the
7 deterrent effect of the development cost.

The Secretary

8 there recites that the development cost can exceed one
9 billion dollars; no bonus has ever reached anywhere near
10 that amount.
11

Turning to the question that was focused on by

12 Justice White, if our opponents concede that the statute
13 does not require testing each and every one of the various
14 alternatives -- and there are at least ten of them -- then
15 there is no basis in the statute to prefer one over
16another.

Congress treated these alternative bonus systems

17 as true alternatives, and it's no good saying that Congress
18 really meant that net profit was the only true alternative.
19 Congress simply did not view it that way.

20

One last thought.

The talk of experimenting is a

21 little lighthearted when one appreciates that it isn't an
22experiment which is subject to repeal.

Once lease is

23 granted, if it turns into an unprofitable operation either
24 in terms of

the revenues engendered or perhaps more

25important in terms of the oil extracted -- and that is one

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of the prime legislative objectives -- there is no repeal.
2 The Secretary has made a very serious mistake which he
3 cannot undo.
4

It would be irresponsible.

QUESTION;

What reason has the Secretary given

5 Congress for not using non-cash bonus systems?
6

MR. CLAIBORNE:

He has, if I may read his most

7 recent answer to Secretary Lowry, the Congressman refers to
8 an affidavit which is filed here in which the Secretary
9 indicates that he has no intention for the present of using
10 the net profit system.

And the Secretary responds as

11 follows:

"We do not believe that the” --

In turn I thought the Court should have the benefit of

16the entire document, and these are now lodged with the Clerk
17of the Court.

It's a document only dated September 14th and

18 therefore couldn't be in the record.

19

The Secretary first makes a legal argument to the

20 effect that he's not compelled to do so, but then he goes on
21 to say,

"We do not believe the variable net profit share

22 bidding or work commitment bidding warrant testing because
23 of the strong likelihood that such systems would severely
24 damage our efforts to promote exploration and development of
25 the Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas that is both

2 if I may interpolate, indicating that he has considered and
3 researched the matter -- "A substantial body of analysis of
4 bidding system performance has been developed over the past
5 five years.

It can now be used to identify the effects of

6such systems as profit share bidding.

Unfortunately, the

7 effects of profit share bidding that we have identified
8 include dampening of exploration and ineffecient development
9 and production.

The effect of work commitment in this

10 analysis is substantial overinvestment in exploration.
