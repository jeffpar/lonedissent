ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL G. BOLOTIN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

MR. BOLOTIN*

Thank you.

9

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please

10

the Court, this is a union democracy case.

11

the Bill of Rights of union members, and whether

12

appointed officials who are appointed by a president,

13

whether they can be discharged or terminated for

14

exercising their rights of freedom of speech and

15

expression in a union election and in particular for

16

supporting the opposition candidate.

17

It involves

The facts in this case can be simply put.

In

18

December of 1977, in Toledo, Ohio, Teamsters Local 20

19

found itself with a third confrontation between two top

20

protagonists, a slate headed by Omar L. Brown, the

21

incumbents, and a slate headed by Harold D. Leu, the

22

insurgents.

23

northwestern Ohio, that covers some 14 counties in

24

northwestern Ohio, and has over 12,500 members.

25

Local 20 is a very large local in

The election was held in three different

1

cities.

On December 9th, it was held in Fremont, Ohio,

2

on the 10th and 11th in Toledo, Ohio, and the 12th in

3

Bryan, Ohio.

4

which hit the northwest Ohio area during those days, the

5

turnout for the election was relatively poor, and

6

approximately only 3,500 members were able to vote.

Due to a blizzard and inclement weather

Leu prevailed in that election by 29 votes,

7
8

although his entire slate of candidates was defeated and

9

the Brown slate officers were elected, with the

10

exception of Brown.

Election protests were filed.

The

11

election eventually was voided in a separate proceeding

12

not directly relevant herein, in a case captioned

13

Marshall v. Leu.

14

Needless to say that the campaign involved was

15

a very vigorous campaign and very heated campaign, since

16

this was the third confrontation between the two top

17

parties.

20

QUESTION;

How much of your case rests on the

First Amendment?
MR. BOLOTIN;

I believe our case rests

21

primarily on the statutory construction of the statutes

22

involved herein.

23

through analogy, but not, I don’t believe, directly

24

controlling in this case.

25

The First Amendment is applicable

Now, Leu's first official act in office was to

conduct a meeting of all the Brown business agents, and

2

at that meeting he discharged them, giving as his

3

reasons that, Number One, they had campaigned for his

4

opponent; Number Two, they were too loyal to his

5

opponent; and Number Three, that he did not believe that

6

they would support his policies and programs which he

7

was about to implement.
QUESTION;

8
9
10

Did he rest to any extent on the

fact that their appointments were "at the pleasure of
the president?"
MR. BOLOTIN;

11

Under the Teamster bylaws, that

12

indeed is what they say, that the appointments are

13

within the president’s discretion.
QUESTION;

14
15

language?

Is it not -- what is the precise

Is it at his discretion or at the pleasure?
MR. BOLOTIN;

The president has -- I believe

it does say at his pleasure to hire, fire, and so forth.
QUESTION;

The same way the President of the

United States appoints several thousand people every -MR. BOLOTIN;

That is the same sort of

appointmient power, yes, on a lesser degree.
Now, he did not make any inquiry.

He did not

23

approach any of the agents, nor did he even ask if they

24

would support his policies and questions.

25

Petitioners immediately went into district court and

The plaintiff

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sought injunctive relief, alleging three causes of

2

action:

3

their equal rights and privileges pursuant to 29 USC

4

Section 411(a)(1); that it was an infringement of their

5

freedom of speech and assembly rights to participate in

6

union affairs, in violation of 29 USC 411(a)(2); and

7

that their discharges constituted discipline within the

8

meaning of Section 529 of the same statutes.

9

one, that the discharge was an infringement of

The district court denied the injunctive

10

relief, and later a motion for summary judgment by the

11

Respondents was filed.

12

Circuit affirmed.

13

It was granted, and the Sixth

Now, the district court -- the reason the

14

district court denied and dismissed the case is that the

15

district court found that the plaintiff Petitioners had

16

not alleged the cause of action under the LfiRDA because

17

the court made an inquiry and reached the point where it

18

found that these business agents were appointed

19

officials, and therefore concluded because they were

20

appointed rather than elected that their rights as

21

members were not affected, and the statutory provisions

22

which I mentioned did not apply.

23

So, after that, the court really didn’t make

24

much of a factual inquiry.

It -- The case is before

25

this Court having been dismissed on summary judgment,

1

even though we would submit that there are factual

2

differences in the record, and the record is — we would

3

also submit, is rather incomplete.

4

The issue, then, therefore, is whether under

5

Section 411(a)(2) and under Section 529, whether these

6

sections, which specifically refer to rights of members,

7

excludes the rights of members who also happen to be

8

appointed officials.

9

all members, including appointed members, and that these

10
11

We submit that members includes

statutory provisions do apply.
In support of our argument, we have

12

essentially four reasons.

13

the plain meaning of the statute, if you look at the

14

definitional section contained in 402(o), it defines

15

"member" as being any person who has fulfilled the

16

requirements of membership, who has not taken

17

involuntary withdrawal card, nor has been disciplined or

18

suspended through some sort of proper union procedure.

19

So the "member" itself says any person.

20

First of all, if you look at

If you look at the language contained in

21

Section -- well, in all three sections and throughout,

22

there are phrases such as "every member", "any member".

23

These are very expansive phrases, which does not -- if

24

you look at their ordinary and common meaning, it would

25

seem to imply that there was no intent by Congress to

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

exclude members who happened to also be appointed

2

officials, or for that matter who happen to be elected

3

officials or officers.
To -- The district court, we believe, erred in

4
5

construing these statutes to make that exclusion.

6

the second reason -QUESTION;

7

Now,

I didn't read the district court's

8

opinion or the opinion of the court of appeals as having

9

excluded members who were officers from protection as

10

members.

The district court says they were wearing two

11

hats, and they are protected in their status as members,

12

but they are not protected in their jobs as members of

13

the president’s advisory committee or cabinet or

14

whatever it was.
HR. BOLOTIN;

15

Well, the decisions did state --

16

did make the distinction between appointed and elected

17

officials.

18

distinction is a meaningful distinction.

19

pointed out, as you indicated, Justice Rehnguist, that

20

the -- their rights as members, according to the

21

district court, were not affected, but indeed, these

22

business agents were disciplined for exercising their

23

rights as members, and the reason given by the newly

24

elected president in discharging them was that they had

25

campaigned, and that they were too loyal for the

We do not necessarily agree that that
It also

1

oppositional candidate.

So there was an indication that

2

yes, indeed, their rights as members were affected.

3

Now, if you look at the legislative history

4

behind these particular sections, the first thing you

5

realize is that it is a little sparse, and the second

6

thing you realize is that there are different things in

7

it that one could draw upon to justify various

8

arguments.

9

Senator Mundin and also of Senator Goldwater discussing

But we -- if you look at the comments of

10

the Schmidt letter to Senator Kennedy, we read from that

11

that they assumed that officers were included, because

12

both of those Senators were discussing the abuses and

13

the reason for the -- the necessity for the law, and

14

they were saying that members have to be protected and

15

officers essentially have to be protected from

16

retaliation by corrupt union officials.
QUESTION;

17

Are you arguing for a construction

18

that would require the president of a union to keep on

19

on the executive committee someone who had campaigned

20

against him in the election?
MR. BOLOTIN;

21

We think that is an illegal

22

reason.

What we are arguing for is a construction which

23

requires the president of the union to make a good faith

24

reasonable inquiry on whether these individuals would

25

oppose or obstruct his policies or not.

What we have in

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

this case is -- the facts show that the president gave

2

what we believe to be an illegal reason, that is, I am

3

getting rii of you because you supported the

4

oppositional candidate.

5

the rule that we are asking for are no different than if

6

you had an incumbent officer and you had an appointed

7

agent working under that incumbent who -- who the

8

incumbent president got word that he was going to run

9

against him, or who happened to criticize him, and then

10

And the facts in this case and

he was terminated because of those viewpoints.
We do not believe that the election process

11
12

itself is sufficiently controlling to justify the

13

termination if the basis of the termination was an

14

illegal reason, and the reason being because you

15

exercised rights protected by the Bill of Rights and

16

Section 411(a)(2),

17

529 .

18

QUESTIONi

(a)(1), and protected also through

Did your clients lose their

membership in the union?
MR. BOLOTIN*

The immediate effect of the

21

discharge was not to lose their membership in the union,

22

but put into motion a procedure whereby after a lapse of

23

time under the Teamster constitution. Article XVIII,

24

Section 5, if they were unable to return to employment

25

within the industry, they would automatically be issued

10

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

involuntary withdrawal cards.
Now, as a practical matter, some of the

2
3

plaintiffs and Petitioners were able to return to their

4

prior employments, but a great many of them were not,

5

and they found themselves out of -- out of work.

6

found that the — the benefits the union had been

7

providing for them were gone.

8

that they were paying dues to the local union.

9

all the benefits of a member, but when they were

They

You must keep in mind
They had

10

terminated, their health and welfare payments were

11

stopped, their Blue Cross, Blue Shield, life insurance

12

premiums all were stopped, and they were out of work,

13

and then it became a question of whether they could

14

return back into the industry through some other

15

employer .

16

QUESTION*

Isn’t that the issue on which the

17

district court said that the complaint simply didn't

18

take up, and if you wanted to go into that, you would

19

have to file a new complaint?

20

NR. BOLOTIN;

The district court did state

21

that, and did state that the complaint should have been

22

amended, but it did not give us an opportunity to amend

23

the complaint, and stopped at the inquiry that no cause

24

of action basically had been asserted.

25

subsequent facts are relevant, because you must look at

Now, I think the

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the motivation at the time of the discharge, and I think

2

if you look at what the effect of the discharge did to

3

the plaintiffs, that is, it set into motion the

4

probability that they would not be able to return to

5

employment in the industry, that shows that this kind of

6

termination did indeed affect their rights as members.
It also did another thing.

7

When they were --

8

Prior to the discharge, they were appointed business

9

agents.

Prior to being appointed business agents, most

10

of these men had been members of the local union for

11

many years.

12

chief stewards, had been very active within the local

13

union, had been very vocal in the local union, and this

14

is why, I submit, they were eventually appointed as

15

business agents.
While they were as business agents, they were

16
17

They had worked their ways up as stewards,

allowed to participate on the stewards' council, which

18 is the -- supposedly the legislative body of the local
19 union.

Now, the stewards' council is composed and

20

comprised of some 800 or 900 stewards, so the business

21

agents' role on that was more of a voice or a vote on

22

the stewards' council.

They certainly were not in a

23 position to control, since there were only 15 of them,
24 to control any policies or decisions that were made -25

that were made, but they indeed, upon being terminated,
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

lost this position, lost this ability to participate as

2

freely, to discuss union matters as openly as they had

3

before,

4

rights as members.

5

terminated because of the campaign and their campaign

6

activity.

7

and they lost it because of the exercise of
There is no question that they were

I think also if you go back and look at the

8

legislative history you will find that there is no -- no

9

where any language which indicates that an exception was

10

being made in 411(a)(2) and in 529 to exclude officers

11

from the coverage.

12

Congress assumed that they would be covered.

13

As I indicated, I believe that the

Now, there is one exclusion exception, and

14

that is in Section

101(a)(5), or 411(a)(5).

411(a)(5)

15

sets forth the procedural due process requirement for

16

the unions, and contained in that section is a specific

17

-- contained in that section is a specific exception

18

that officers and employees were not -- did not have the

19

due process rights of the regular membership,

20

go back and you look at the legislative history and the

21

purpose behind that exception, you will find that

22

Congress was concerned with allowing a potentially

23

corrupt union official who was in power, who was

24

misusing union funds or perhaps not holding meetings

25

pursuant to the bylaws, they were concerned that if you

and if you

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

did not have that exception in the procedural part of

2

the Bill of Rights, then that corrupt union official

3

would be able to cause serious harm to the union as an

4

institution before a trial could proceed or before he

5

could be removed to determine whether indeed he was

6

harming the union or indeed whether he was corrupt.

7

Now, we submit that because this exclusion was

8

specifically put in 411(a)(5), and not put in Section

9

529, that it indicates an intent on the part of Congress

10

not to exclude officers and employees from the

11

protection of 529 and therefore also from the protection

12

of 411(a)(1) and (a)(2).

13
14

QUESTION;

Isn't the question here how you

construe the statute?

15

MR. BOLOTIN;

16

QUESTION;

That's right.

That's right.

And do you say -- do you say that

17

the statute should be construed as the Constitution

18

would be construed, or is it just some --

19

MR. BOLOTIN;

20

QUESTION;

21

22

I say that —

Did Congress just -- was it just

legislating in the dark?
MR. BOLOTIN;

No,

I say that the statute

23

should be construed with the Constitution in mind,

24

because the legislative history does indicate that they

25

were attempting to adopt a bill of rights comparable to
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

the constitution for union members.
QUESTION;

2

Well, do you think

that then -- if

3

you knew what the Constitut ion meant at that time, would

4

you think that is the meani ng that the statute should

5

have?
MR. BOLOTIN;

6

Not necessarily.

I think that

7

is a question of Congressio nal intent in interpreting

8

the statute.
QUESTION;

9
10

course it is.

So what did Congress intend?

MR. BOLOTIN;

11

12

Well, of course it is, so -- of

I am acquainted wi th the Adler and the

QUESTION:

Well,

would you agree or wouldn't

22

you that the statute should be construed in the light of

23

the constitutional law that existed at that time,

24

whatever it was?

25

MR. BOLOTIN:

I d on’t necessarily agree with
15

that proposition, and for this reason.

that it is difficult to know -QUESTION*

3

Well,

The reason is

would you still not agree

4

with it if you could show that the constitutional law

5

then was exactly what it is now?

suppose.

7

the constitutional law then is precisely what it is

now.

9

of independent construction to the statute?

I don't think that's true, but suppose that

Would

you still say that you should give some kind

MR. BOLOTIN*

10

Suppose -- just

I think that would be very

11

tempting, to take that position, since as I construe the

12

constitutional law now it is more favorable for our

13

position, but the point I wish to make is that it is

14

difficult enough to construe the Congressional intent

15

without going through the court cases and construing the

16

judicial intent, which also may existed at the same

17

time.

18

is more important to focus on the -- the Congressional

19

intent of Congress in passing it, because you --

I think when you are dealing with a statute, it

up on my Brother White's question, I gather your

argument focuses, statutory argument, in any event,

primarily on the word "discpline" in 609, does it?
MR. BOLOTIN:

24
25

Well, and infringement in 411 as

well.

1

Yes, but do I -- perhaps I didn't

2

correctly understand your argument, but I thought your

3

argument emphasized that under 609, it is a violation to

discipline for this protected conduct.
MR. BOLOTIN;

That is true.

One is the discipline.

QUESTION;

Well, there wasn't any misconduct

involved, was there?
MR. BOLOTIN;

Misconduct in the sense of --

14

well, according to the newly elected president, the

15

misconduct was that they supported the wrong candidate,

16

and they exercised their political opposition.

exercising rights of freedom of expression is a form of

MR. BOLOTIN:

No, we do not give that up.

Even if we were to -- if the Court were to reject the

8

529 or the 609 argument, the 411 argument is still a

9

very good argument, and a -- and it is certainly an

10

inf ringement.

11

QUESTION:

What about retaliation?

12

MR. BOLOTIN:

Well, the retaliation argument

13

is sort of combining both of them, because it

demonstrates a lack of -QUESTION:

that independently proscribed by the statute?
MR. BOLOTIN:

I think it is inherent in 529

and in the infringement language, that if you -QUESTION:

What is the size of the stewards'

How many members?
MR. BOLOTIN:

7

Yes.

There's approximately, at any --

8

it depends upon the population of the local in terms of

9

layoffs and so forth, but at that time there were

10

approximately 800 to 1,000 stewards, including assistant

11

stewards and chief stewards and so forth.
QUESTION;

12
13

You had a local union of about

10,000 members?

14

HR. BOLOTIN;

was about 1,000?

Correct.

Right.

And it included all of the

business agents?
MR. BOLOTIN;

20
21

12,500.

And all the stewards and all the

officers.
QUESTION:

Yes.

And how many business agents

would there be all together, roughly?
MR.

BOLOTIN;

There were approximately 20

business agents all together, because all the officers

That's, I believe, correct.

Um-hm.
The other reason that the --

Did the president in his action

rely on the proposition that he as the duly elected

10

president was entitled to have people who were in

11

sympathy with his point of view and who would faithfully

12

execute his policies?

13

MR. BOLOTIN;

He did state that at some point

14

in either his deposition or at the preliminary

15

injunctive hearing, and perhaps even at the meeting,

16

although I don’t have the --

17

QUESTION:

Is that not inherent in the union

18

constitution and the provision that these men, his

19

people hold office at the pleasure of the president?

20

MR. BOLOTIN:

That is inherent in the bylaws

21

of the Local 20.

22

and exclusive appointive power.

23

complaining about here is that he --

25

That is, the president has the sole

Is it the

It may be in both.

I know it's

I think the constitutional

They get their office by his

QUESTION:

10

That's correct.

That's

That's correct.

Well, Mr. Bolotin, if that is so,

11

if that is expressed or implied in the constitution and

12

the bylaws,

13

qualification at the very end of

14

reasonable rules and regulations and such organizations'

15

constitution and bylaws?

then on your 411

MR. BOLOTIN:

16

argument, what of the
(a)(1), subject to

Well, the question is, was it

17

reasonable to discharge these particular business

18

agents.

19

Are they -QUESTION:

Well, no.

This says, subject to

20

reasonable rules.

Are you suggesting such a rule,

21

whether explicit or implied , would not be reasonable?

22

MR. BOLOTIN:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

No --

That on — if you support the

change of administration, why, the new president -MR. BOLOTIN:

What I am suggesting is that if

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

you, as the president did in this case, enunciate an

2

unlawful reason along with perhaps lawful reasons for

3

the discharge, then I think it becomes --

4

QUESTIONi

Well, suppose -- suppose the

5

constitution and bylaws have explicitly set out that on

6

the election of a new president, that president shall --

7

may dismiss all the business agents.

8

in so many words.

9
10

11

Suppose it said so

Would you be here?

MR. BOLOTIN:

Yes, we would still be here,

because this is a retaliatory discharge -QUESTION:

Well, except that the 411(a)(1)

12

says that all -- everything that -- in the way of rights

13

and privileges thereby conferred are subject to

14

reasonable rules and regulations in such organization's

15

constitution and bylaws.

16

QUESTION:

Well, you would say that wouldn't

17

be a reasonable rule, I suppose.

18

MR. BOLOTIN:

Well, what we would say is that

19

that -- that qualifying language is not the same

20

language that is worded in 411(a)(2), which says that it

21

does have a reasonable rule, but it also talks about

22

protecting the union as an institution, and if you look

23

at the legislative history, you will see that there were

24

two concerns of Congress.

25

practically as possible, ensure as much free speech and

One, they wanted to, as

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

democratic processes as possible, and two, they did not

2

want the union as an institution to be harmed.

3

Now, to the extent that you have appointed

4

officials who perhaps are at a very high level, who are

5

involved as the -- in the Branti case, the analogy in

6

the Branti case, who were involved in policy-making or

7

who to the extent are confidential employees, then I

8

would submit that it could be argued that the union as

9

an institution would perhaps be in some sort of jeopardy

10

if these people were allowed to stay on the payroll, but

11

what we are saying --

12

QUESTIONi

Even two, 411(2) has a

13

qualification, doesn't it, a proviso, that nothing

14

herein shall be construed to impair the right of a labor

15

organization to adopt and enforce reasonable rules as to

16

the responsibility of every member toward the

17

organization.

18

MR. BOLOTIN:

Right, but they are talking

19

there of the conduct of the member toward the union as

20

an institution, not necessarily on the right of the

21

president to hire and fire because someone happens to

22

exercise the rights set forth in the preceding language

23

in Subsection (2), and I think that is important.

24
25

QUESTION:

What if they had a rule that said

in so many words, anybody who votes against the

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

incumbent president will be fired the day after the

2

president is re-elected?

3

under the statute?
MR. BOLOTINi

4

Would that be permissible

No, it would not be permissible,

5

because I don't think union bylaws can be -- supersede

6

the laws of the United States.
QUESTION;

7

Well, but is there anything in the

8

statute that would prohibit that?

9

that ?
MR. BOLOTIN;

10

What would prohibit

There is a section later on that

11

requires that the constitution and bylaws be filed with

12

the Secretary of Labor, and that they must provide

13

certain reasonable procedures.

14

exact cite, but I do believe there is something in the

15

bill of -- the Landrum-Griffin Act concerning that point.
QUESTION;

16

I don't remember the

Do you rely at all on the

17

particular jobs these people had?

18

19

senior?

20

Would it be a

I am not quite clear on what your position is.
MR. BOLOTIN;

Well, I think the court --

21

unfortunately, we are here on summary judgment, and the

22

court never -- decided this case as if there were no

23

factual issues in dispute, but never really made the

24

proper factual inquiries to determine what standards

25

should be applied.

I think it is conceivable that you

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

can get a very high position in the local union, like

2

the chief administrative assistant to the president, or

3

his confidential secretary.

4

might reguire for the legitimate benefit of the union as

5

an institution that they be removed, but in this case,

6

we have a record that does not indicate -- that does not

7

indicate what role these business agents played, and the

8

Respondents, at the last page of their brief, in their

9

argument, concede that these business agents were not

In those positions, it

10

involved in policy formulating at all.

They are

comparable to district attorneys, assistant district

They performed representation in servicing the members.

because of what anybody said.

It wasn't because they opposed him, or

they had just said who they were for?

MR. BOLOTIN:

QUESTION:

22
23

I think that --

Would the -- would the judgment

below permit cleaning those people out?
MR. BOLOTIN:

Well, I would think it would

24

necessitate the court below to make an inquiry on

25

whether that was a reason for the discharge.

MR. BOLOTIN;

-- once you accept the notion

that appointed officials are protected, and now it is

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. IORIO:

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, Members

of the Court, may it please the Court, initially, I

20

think it is important to reflect very quickly on some of

21

the facts as it relates to this matter.

22

counsel has hit on some of them, there are some other

critical facts that I think the Court should be aware of.

Initially, the bylaws of Local 20 clearly and

MR. IORIO:

so there are reasons for

Where there is specific

legislative enactment, Justice White, I would agree,

18

that where Title 7 or the Labor Board has specific rules

19

and regulations as they relate to labor unions as an

20

institution, as with any institution --

21

QUESTION:

Well, suppose he didn't fire them

-- suppose he didn’t fire them at the — when he came

23

into office, but a little later, when one of them said

24

something in some union meeting contrary to what — what

25

he thought was contrary to his policies.

Do you think

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

he could just fire them?
MR. lORIOi

agent, that's correct.
QUESTION;

4
5

If he is an appointed business

Suppose he just said to them, I

want your resignation, giving no reason at all.
MR. I0RI0;

6

If the president had asked for the

7

resignation and given no reason at all, he certainly

8

could do that under the bylaws and under the

9

Landrum-Griffin Act as it exists today.
QUESTION;

10

11

You would be relying on the

provision --

12

MR. I0RI0:

13

QUESTION;

14

Of the Act.
— that they serve at the pleasure

of the president.

15

MR. I0RI0:

16

QUESTION:

Exactly.
You would still be subject to suit,

17

that -- if somebody could prove that he really fired

18

them for a specific — for a specifically forbidden

19

reason.

20

MR. I0RI0;

Well, again, I assume if the

21

appointed business agent sued on the basis that it was

22

because of race or something specifically prohibited,

23

certainly --

24
25

QUESTION;

Yes.

You would have to prove it.

You would have to prove it.

That’s right.

They would have to

prove it.

But if it was as a result of the facts that

are before this Court, we think it is fairly clear what

4

Congress intended when they passed the Landrum-Griffin

5

bill.

6

of view that the business agents at Local 20, and it is

before the record, the business agents negotiate

contracts, they determine in the first instance what

cases will be arbitrated, and they handle the day to day

affairs of the labor union as it relates to

14

QUESTION:

So they are the very

I suppose you would have a harder

15

case if it was the Ladies' Garment Workers Union, and

16

the president said, I really think that the business

17

agent of this big unit must be a woman, not a man.

18

would give you a rather hard case, wouldn't it?

19

MR. IORIOi

That

That would make it more difficult,

20

Your Honor, but again, on the basis of looking --

21

putting aside specific legislative enactments as they

22

relate to labor or to employers or whatever particular

23

organizations, given these specific facts, we think it

24

is clear absent any kind of race or --

25

QUESTION:

Why do you think -- why do you
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

think he is justified in firing them all, because of

2

reasonable questions about their loyalty?
MR. I0RI0:

3

Yes, but I think it is important

4

on the facts. Justice White, that the business agent

5

here, and on the record, the administrative assistant to

6

Brown, who was the incumbent, stated himself that a

business agent must be loyal to the president and his

policies.

disloyalty.

15

The reason was that they campaigned

reflects disloyalty, and the record reflects also that

MR. I0RI0:

What if they had

Would you take

Well, clearly, Your Honor, as it
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

relates to this Court’s reasoning in Branti and in

2

Elrod, this Court has taken a distinction in the

3

constitutional area, the First Amendment —

4

QUESTION;

Right.

5

MR. IORIO;

-- but again, in this particular

6

-- on the facts of this particular case, absent the

7

application of a constitutional doctrine, we would say

8

that although these are not the facts, that under the

9

current status of the laws that exist today, that they

10

would be permitted to terminate.

11

QUESTION;

They would be permitted.

12

MR. IORIO:

13

QUESTION;

They would be permitted.

Yes.

So it really doesn't matter whether

14

they are business agents or bookkeepers, under your view

15

of the law.
MR. IORIO;

16

That's correct, although an

17

adoption of a Branti-like standard or an Elrod-like

18

standards based on what the duties of the business

19

agents do, they would clearly fall within that rationale.
QUESTION;

20

Well, how do -- there hasn't been a

21

trial.

22

them would definitely be policy-making appointed

23

officials.

24

is what I am wondering.

25

That’s what I was wondering about.

All 800 of

Is it perfectly clear on the record?

MR. IORIO;

That

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVS., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

business agents, there was approximately that were

2

involved, and the business agents that were involved,

3

from the record it's clear they negotiate contracts,

4

that they involve themselves in determining what cases

5

are arbitrated at the first instance, and they handle

6

the day to day affairs of the membership, and that

7

really is the heart of what a local union does, and that

8

is done, of course, through the business agents who are

9

out in the field and out in the shop dealing with the

10

membership, and we feel that the record -QUESTION;

11

So you really make two arguments,

12

if I understand you.

13

of close to the -- close to the executive, like a

14

policy-making person, that they should be able to fire.

15

And secondly, you say in any event it is a statutory

16

question and the Branti line of cases just doesn't apply

17

at all.

18

One is that they are in the nature

You make both arguments.
MR. I0RI0:

That's right.

We would also make,

19

although I haven't gotten there, Your Honor, we would

20

also make a third argument that a Mount Healthy type of

21

standard would also be applicable here, in the sense

from another point of view as it relates to some of the

questions from Justice Stevens, as it relates -- and

this was brought up initially on Petitioners's case, we

think it is relevant that this Court in a time frame

sense look back to 1959, and when you look back to 1959

2

in order to glean the intent of what the Congress wanted

3

to do as it related to Title I or 609, that it's clear

4

that Congress could not have intended nor did they

5

intend to protect in a patronage way as they did — as

6

this Court has done in Branti and Elrod subsequent, they

7

could not have intended that.

8

those lines at that time, in 1959, and it is clear that

9

Congress had enough knowledge of the area in the sense

The law was nowhere along

10

that they distinguished between elected officials or

11

appointed officials, as they did at 401(h) of the Act,

12

so that they were aware that there were distinctions.

13
14
15

QUESTION*

So you say Elrod and other

developments like that since then are irrelevant.
MR. IORIO*

We are saying as they relate to

16

this, yes, because Elrod and Branti are irrelevant

17

because this is a statutory case, this is not a

18

constitutional case.

19

reasonable standard which is, of course, different than

20

the First Amendment standard, which requires compelling

21

governmental interest, so that on that basis alone, the

22

language itself is written, not -- it does not adopt the

23

First Amendment language by any stretch of the

24

imagination, nor did Congress indicate in its

25

legislative history anything to indicate that they

The Act itself in Title I has a

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

wanted to formulate a theory or a policy that would run

2

parallel to the First Amendment of the Constitution.

3

And also, Your Honor, when you look, at the

4

legislative history, when you see the original draft of

5

the Bill of Bights and the Bill of Rights's first draft,

6

it had very strong language in 101(a)(2), the free

7

speech provision, that -- that indicated that a member

8

-- that no member could be subject to penalty discipline

9

or interference of any kind.

It was very broad when

10

that was put together, and then as it went through the

11

hearings and the conference committees and the like, the

12

Keuchel amendment, of course, followed, and that

13

amendment cut that language out, which we feel clearly

14

indicates that Congress did not intend to give a broad

15

and absolute approach to the rights as contained in

16

Title I, but rather a limited one.
QUESTION;

17

Isn't it pretty clear, though, that

18

a member, a member as a member, has much broader rights

19

to do almost anything he wants to do free of any

20

interference as distinguished from a member who is an

21

officer?

22

MR. I0RI0:

Well, in the case -- that's

23

correct, Your Honor.

appointed officer, and of course there is a major

25

distinction between an appointed and an elected officer.

In this case, though, it's an

1

QUESTION;

Yes, and an elected officer.

2

MR. IORIO:

That's correct.

The whole concept

3

of Landrum-Griffin was a bill that was put together in

4

order to look to the member and balance the rights of a

5

member vis-a-vis the union institution.

6

QUESTION;

7

MR. IORIO;

8

QUESTION;

9

Counsel —
Yes.
-- on that point, some of the

briefs that have been filed indicate that it was the

10

desire of Congress to rely on kind of unfettered union

11

democracy to reach better results in terms of union

12

practices, and urged this Court to reverse on the basis

13

that to affirm the Court below would give the union the

14

tools to create a one-party patronage machine.

15

you comment on the position taken in some of those

16

briefs?
MR. IORIO;

17

Would

Your Honor, the — of course, the

18

facts before this case indicate that -- particularly at

19

Local 20, which is the local that is before this Court,

20

that there has been a history here of a two-party

21

system.

22

tribute to Landrum-Griffin in the sense that there have

If anything, the facts of this case are a

23 been three or four elections in which Mr. Brown and Mr.
24

Leu have fought each other on a number of occasions,

25

where they have, and the record discloses, have been

engaged in very heated campaigns, election campaigns.
And we would submit that where the local union

2

3

members determine the bylaws, and they say in their

4

bylaws they want their president to pick the agents,

5

that that in effect is a referendum on the business

6

agents, and if the business agents are doing a job, and

7

they are out in the shop and they are doing a job, then

8

the president who is elected is not going to have any

9

problems.

10

We think that the way Local 20 is set up their

11

-- the bylaws and the way that they operate indicates

12

exactly what Congress wanted.

13

what kind of bylaws do you want?

14

these are the bylaws, the kind of bylaws we want.

15

is the kind of president we want to have.

16

president's business agents don’t do the job, then he is

17

going to be gone, and we don't see that patronage as it

18

relates to your particular inquiry would in any way cut

19

down on the effectiveness of union members' rights,

20

because the stewards’ council, again, the bylaws are

21

before this Court, indicates that they can change the

22

bylaws if they want.

They said to the members,
The members said,

In fact, the irony of this case is, and it is

24

on the record, Mr. Brown ran a campaign on the basis he

25

wanted elected business agents.

That was a finding by

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

And of course that was

1

Judge Young in the lower court

2

never put into effect, and Judge Young commented, well,

3

maybe if it had we would have a different result here,

4

but be that as it may, again, we feel that the way that

5

this whole situation has been handled is a tribute to

6

the Landrum-Griffin process.

7

There has been some reference to 609, and very

8

quickly, I would like to point out that as it relates to

9

609, that 609 was preceded by 506 and the legislative

10

history, and when it was -- when 506 was put together --

11

it's the identical language of 609 -- that when it was

12

put together the bill of rights had not even been -- had

13

not been formulated.

14

from 609 an intent to broaden the rights under Title I

15

of the Act.

Therefore it is difficult to glean

Also, again, when Congress wanted to

16
17

distinguish and indicate its -- that it understood the

18

difference between discipline and removal as it did in

19

201(a) of the Act, it spelled out under the Title II

20

provisions, the reporting provisions, that unions have

21

to report discipline or removal of an officer or an

22

agent.

23

would you have to put discipline or removal?

24
25

And surely, if discipline meant removal, why

As importantly, in 101(a)(5), the procedural
due process aspect of Landrum-Griffin, the court in
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

parallel language to 609, almost identical language, the

2

legislative history is clear from Senator Kennedy's

3

comments that officers were not to be included with the

4

"every member" language of 101(a)(5) of Landrum-Griffin,

5

and that is clearly spelled out, and unless there is a

6

reason to the contrary, it seems pretty clear that if

7

Congress meant 101(a)(5) to exclude union officers

8

within the definition of "member" with the same kind of

9

language as 609, it seems only consistent that in 609

10

the same type of reasoning should be adopted.
QUESTION;

11

Is there anything in the language

12

of the statute or in the legislative history that

13

suggests that Congress was contemplating an Act that

14

would give tenure to appointed officers?
HR. TORIO:

15

Your Honor, I would suggest to the

16

-- well, first of all, the legislative history is sparse

17

on it.

18

is hard to believe that the Congressmen at that time who

19

were attempting to balance the interests of the union

20

and the interests of the members, and who themselves

21

have engaged in patronage, would have assumed or would

22

have put into an Act a patronage type of — or outlawed

23

patronage, particularly at that time, in 1959, without

24

specifically laying it out within the Act.

25

is almost inconceivable that those who enjoyed the

But I would suggest that the Congressmen — it

I mean, it

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

patronage system would take it away from the union

2

institutions without specifically referring to it in the

3

legislative history, and there is absolutely none of

4

that.

5

I would like to just briefly comment on Branti

6

and Elrod for a moment, because it has been raised by

7

the various briefs here that the Branti and the Elrod

8

have some application here, and as I have already

9

indicated, it is our position that the court -- that the

10

Congress did not intend for Landrum-Griffin or the Title

11

I aspects to follow the evolution of the First Amendment

12

of the Constitution, and that it requires an entirely

13

different interpretation of this Court.

14

That issue, the Branti-Elrod issue, was never

15

raised in the court below, and was raised for the first

16

time as we got to this Court, but nonetheless, we feel

17

it is ripe for adjudication, although I would point out

18

to the Court that under the Branti and, assuming the

19

Court feels in some way that it's applicable, that under

20

the Branti and Elrod standard, that in those cases the

21

Court was very clear in setting forth the factual

22

situation that the individuals protected there, the

23

bailiff or the summonser or the public defender, were

24

passive in the political process.

25

The facts in this case are, is that we have a
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

very active participant and personal confrontations, and

2

we would suggest to the Court that in that situation

3

Branti and Elrod should not be applicable, and the

4

reason for that is, and it’s fairly simple, there is no

5

way a local union, or for that matter any organization,

6

could operate on the basis of having people that were in

7

confrontation, as they were in this very hotly contested

8

election, sit down and try to work together.

9

internal bickering would make the very function of the

The

10

union impossible, not to mention the fragmentation of

11

the power of the union in dealing with employers,

12

particularly in the troubled times that we face today.

13

Also, as it relates to Branti, we would point

14

out to the Court that, using Justice Stevens’s language,

15

that in this particular case, if it is applicable, that

16

we feel that party affiliation, if that is what we want

17

to call those who supported Harold Leu, is an

18

appropriate requirement for the effective performance of

19

office for the reasons we have just given, that it would

20

cause fragmentation of the union and internal bickering,

21

not to mention the fact under the Branti or Eldrod

22

standard that these are -- business agents are defined

23

as key administrative personnel under the Act itself,

24

that, as I said, they negotiate contracts, do the

25

grievances, handle the day to day affairs of the union.
44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

And we would suggest, and I think it was a

1
2

concern of this Court in Elrod, that to permit business

3

agents who have campaigned head to head in the situation

4

that we have here today, to say to the insurgent in this

5

case, you can't hire who you want, would be to put

6

people in the position where they could thwart, within

7

the language of Elrod, thwart the policies of the in

8

par ty.

9

In conclusion, we would suggest to the Court

10

that we cannot imagine a factual situation or cannot

11

imagine that Congress would have ever in its day

12

intended, in 1959, that an insurgent who ran in a union

13

election and ran on a platform — on a platform which

14

said to the members, we don’t feel you are getting good

15

service, we are going to clean house when we get in,

16

that Title I in any way precludes that insurgent after

17

winning the union election from cleaning house, as it

18

were, particularly where the people that were -- in

19

which -- were terminated, that those business agents

20

that were terminated fully participated to the fullest

21

as it relates to their Title I rights, and therefore we

22

suggest that based on the record before this Court, that

23

the lower -- the courts of the -- the lower courts were

24

correct in their determination, and look for an

25

affirmation.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL G. BOLOTIN, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

6

MR. BOLOTIN;

Thank you.

7

The problem is the record before this Court,

8

and the other problem is that this matter is before the

9

Court on summary judgment.

There is no doubt that there

10

are facts in the record which counsel for the

11

Respondents can refer to to support their arguments, but

12

there are equally facts in the record that show that the

13

facts are in dispute, and the facts are not not in

14

dispute, and in particular, counsel is referring to the

15

fact that Harold Leu ran a campaign against these

16

business agents because they were providing poor

17

representation, but if you look at Page 64 of Harold

18

Leu's deposition, which is not in the joint appendix but

19

is contained in the records of the Court, when asked

20

under cross examination why he terminated the agents or

21

whether he campaigned against them, this is what he

22

said.

23

possibly that Harold Leu represents you, that was my

24

theme.

25

business agents, you are wrong.

"Where it was on there, on the literature

If you think that I campaigned against the

the administration because that's where the

2

responsibilities lies.”
QUESTIONi

3

So that --

Well, aren't they -- aren't they

4

part of the administration, the business agents, by

5

their -- the other hats they wear?
MR. BOLOTIN:

6

Yes, but the point I am making,

7

Chief Justice Burger, is that the facts are in dispute

8

as to whether he campaigned against them or campaigned

9

against Brown as the chief officer of the local union.

10

The other thing that is in dispute is the factual issue

11

of whether he indeed received a mandate from the

12

membership to replace these business agents.

13

all of Brown's officers were elected.

14

that if it weren't for the blizzard, Brown would be in

15

office and this case wouldn't be before this -- wouldn't

16

be before this Court today, and in fact the election

17

ultimately was declared null and void because of

18

employer money which Leu received in the campaign.

In fact,

We would submit

So, clearly, there was never any mandate.

19

I

20

am not suggesting that the fact that the election was

21

voided is determinative of the issues in this case.

22

am merely stating that the facts in the record are not

23

clear.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BOLOTIN:

I

Has there been a re-election?
Yes, there has.

There was a

1

rerun election

2

QUESTION;

3

MR. BOLOTIN;

4
5

And did Leu -Leu prevailed at that point.

That's correct, with another very close election.
Now, let me conclude by saying that you have

6

to keep in mind the basic overall policy behind

7

Landrum-Griffin and the Bill of Rights, and that was a

8

policy that came about because of corruption,

9

dictatorial practices, racketeering, employer and unions

10

being in bed together, if I may use that phrase, and a

11

policy where union members and officers were being

12

denied rights.

13

If you keep that policy in mind, you must find

14

that appointed officials in this case must be protected

15

for the exercise of those rights, and you must take an

16

expansive and ordinary common meaning of the language

17

contained in these sections rather than the restrictive

18

meaning that -- which would exclude coverage for

19

appointed officials.

20

QUESTION;

Would not the position you take

21

mean that if a "reform candidate," putting that in

22

quotation marks, who campaigned against the president in

23

authority on the grounds of corruption within the union

24

tolerated by the business agents and the other people of

25

the governing body, then came into office with an
48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

overwhelming vote, are you saying that the statute

2

contemplated that the new president, the reform

3

candidate, should be saddled with the people against

4

whom he had charged corruption?

5

MR. BOLOTIN*

Well, if they were corrupt

6

individuals, and that determination was made, then it

7

would be --

8

9

QUESTION;

No, not a determination, but he

campaigned against them on the grounds that the whole

10

crowd were corrupt, that they were looting the

11

retirement fund, the pension fund, and so forth.

12

apart from whether he can sustain the proof of that, the

13

membership of the union has then voted him into office

14

and voted the other fellows out.

15

determination of the facts.

16

have given you.

17

MR. BOLOTIN;

Now,

No hearing, no

Just the hypothetical I

Well, based upon those facts,

18

then the reason for the discharge would not be unlawful,

19

because he is not discharging them for the exercise of

terminating them because of their political expression

in an election.
