ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIMON B. KARAS, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. KARAS:

7

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

8 it please the Court:

In the three cases before this Court for decision,

9

10 the state of Ohio is attempting to give meaning and content
11

to the decision in Wainwright v. Sykes.

12

aware of the deviceiveness and divergence of opinions in the

13 court below,

The Court is well

but I think that there is one word that is

14 missing from all of those opinions that acts as a common
15 defect,
16
17 simple.

and that is the absence of the word "federalism.”
The state sees this issue as federalism, pure and
In a single decision, the court below has avoided

18 Ohio's construction of its contemporaneous objection
19 and has also overturned a

rule

state's construction of its own

20 substantive law.
21

If Wainwright v. Sykes is to have any meaning, it

22 must be grounded in the concept that federalism allows a
23 state certain latitudes in
24

the administration of justice.

The facts in our case are relatively simple.

25 Prior to 1974, Ohio

filed the common law rule that the
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 defendant bore the burden of persuasion by a preponderance
2 of the evidence on the affirmative defense of self-defense,
3 insanity and duress.
4

On January 1, 1974, the legislature enacted Ohio

5 revised Code 2901.05(A) which provided that the defendant
6 has the burden of going forward with evidence of the
7 affirmative defense.
8

QUESTION*

Was this special legislation or was it

9 part of a general -10

NR. KARAS*

It was part of a code revision.

There

11 was a complete revision of the definitions of Ohio
12 substantive crimes; there was also a revision of the
13 procedure.

Ohio adopted criminal rules of procedure at that

14 time contemporaneously.

There was a little bit of

15 divergence in the time when they took place.

The rule

16 started in 1973 and some of the subtantive sections in 1974.
17

Now, on July 21, 1976, the Ohio Supreme Court

18 decided the case of State v. Robinson.

In that case the

19 court held that the defendant no longer bore the burden of

20 persuasion by a preponderance of the evidence, though he did
21 retain a burden of production on the affirmative defense.
22

The three cases before the Court all occurred

23 prior to the Robinson decision.

Mr. Hughes' case occurred

24 in January of 1975, Mr. Bell’s in April of 1975, Mr.

Isaac's

25 in I believe it was September of 1975.

place.

burden of proof by preponderance of the evidence, but if he

AFTERNOON SESSION

( 1 & 00 p. m . )

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGERi

4

HR. KARASt

Thank you.

Counsel, you may resume.
I will pick up with the

5 facts because I believe it’s very important how these cases
6 developed.

I had just pointed out that there had been no

7 objection to the traditional instruction.
8

On appeal, only one of the three defendants raised

9 the issue.

That was Mr. Isaac.

It's not quite clear

10 whether he was raising it on the basis that the state court
11 should apply the Robinson decision as to him, or whether
12 there was a simultaneous challenge to the validity of the
13 traditional instruction as well.
14

On federal habeas corpus, the various district

15 courts decided the case alternatively on a lack of showing
16 of cause, and also a lack of showing of prejudice.
17 rehearing en banc, the court was quite split.
18 six separate opinions.
19

On

There were

The plurality opinion found that

cause was shown by the apparent futility of raising the

20 question prior to Robinson.
21

As to the cause question, and despite the fact

22 that State v. Robinson was a state statutory interpretation,
23

the court found that Ohio had created an additional element

24

of the crime of absence of the affirmative defense.

25

Now, our petition has challenged both the cause
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and prejudice rulings by the court below.

I think for

2 purposes of analysis it would be easier to start with the
3 cause question.
4

I start, as I think I must, with the decision in

5 Hankerson v. North Carolina, footnote 8.

In Hankerson, the

6 court was concerned with the impact of applying Mullaney v.
7 Wilbur retroactive to the states.
8

I think it ties in with the question of Wainwright

9 because Hankerson was decided six days prior to the opinion
10 in Wainwright v. Sykes.

Now, in Hankerson, in response to

11 the state's concern that Hullaney would dictate over 700
12 rehearsals of homicide convictions, the court in the
13 footnote posited that the fears of the state were not as
14 great as might be imagined because the states, if they wish,
15 may be able to insulate prior convictions by enforcing the
16 normal contemporaneous objection rule.
17

In these cases, that's exactly what Ohio did.

In

18 State v. Williams and State v. Humphries they found that the
19 failure to have objected was a waiver of the question.

In

20 State v. Long, they further indicated that they would not
21 hold a State v. Robinson error to be plain error just merely
22 by citation to the case, but that you actually had to look
23 at the facts and circumstances of the individual case.
24

QUESTION*

What's your response, counsel, to the

25 argument that up until the Ohio Supreme Court decision in
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Robinson it had been set a law in Ohio that this instruction
2 would not be given?
3

MR. KARAS;

Your Honor, I believe that Hankerson

4 shows the correct analysis for a question of this type.
5 don’t see Hankerson as being a novel question at all.

I
I

6 think it's a recognition of a longstanding doctrine that a
7 reviewing court need not reach an issue which a party
8 complaining of the error could have brought to the attention
9 of the court but did not, at a time when the court could
10 have corrected it or the error could have been avoided.
11

Now, notice that I say the word could have rather

12 than would have, because I think that there’s a distinction
13 to be drawn between the two words, and also, that that
14 distinction is the difference between our position and the
15 position of the plurality.
16

When I use the words could have been raised, I

17 don’t mean it in some metaphysical sense that you could

18 always raise a question; that counsel should anticipate a
19 35th amendment to the Constitution that has not yet been

20 enacted.

I’m also not indulging in the legal fiction that

21 once a court declares the law, that it is deemed always to

22 have been the law and therefore, a failure to object is a
23 waiver of it.
24

I think it’s a recognition of the fact that when

25 the tools are available to construct the argument, that you

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 can charge counsel with the obligation of raising that
2 argument; otherwise, a failure to raise it will be deemed
3 binding on the client.
4

The argument of the court of appeals about a

5 apparent futility -6

QUESTION*

Do you think you could say counsel was

7 incompetent, constitutionally incompetent, if he didn't
8 raise it?
9

MR. KARAS*

Well, Mr. Justice White, I think that

10 is somewhat of the extension that the respondents are trying
11 to make.

They are going one step farther and are using the

12 words "should have raised" the question.
13

Our concern about Wainwright v. Sykes is that if

14 you don't identify any middle ground in which the actions of
15 counsel can be deemed binding on the client -16

QUESTION*

17

MR. KARAS *

And not incompetent.
And not incompetent, that you

18 effectively destroy the decision.

If the objection is well

19 known, then the failure of counsel to raise it will be
20 deemed ineffectiveness of counsel.

If the objection is not

21 well known, then under the court of appeals decision it is
22 deemed inadvertence or apparent futility, and is found to be
23 cause, and there's no middle ground between the two.
24

I think we 're giving recognition of the fact that

25 there's a whole range of decisions that counsel are
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 entrusted to make, and sometimes, the power to make a
2 decision includes the power to err or the power not to see a
3 question that should have been raised.
4

Take, for example, the argument of a apparent

5 futility.

Assume that counsel actually saw the argument and

6 failed to raise it because of the nature of the prior Ohio
7 law.

That is as strategic as any other decision that

8 counsel is supposed to make.
9

Now, the fact that he does not raise it when he

10 sees the argument and fails to raise it in light of the
11 prior law, is, in the words of Mr. Justice Powell, I
12 believe, an inexcusable procedural default of a known
13 right.

On the other hand, if the objection is not perceived

14 but could have been perceived —
15

QUESTION*

Like the fellow perceived it who

16 finally raised it and had a decision on it.
17

MR. KARAS*

Obviously, the question was raised,

18 and any time you have an overruling of a prior precedent or
19 a new development in the law, somebody has to make the first

20 step.
21

But I think that argument can be shown by a

22 distinction between the cases of O'Connor v. Ohio and Lee v.
23 Missouri.

In Lee v. Missouri, this Court held that Duran v.

24 Missouri was retroactive as to the date of Taylor v.
25 Louisiana; but indicated that the failure to have objected

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 might be deemed a waiver of that.
2

I think what the Court was saying is that as of

3 the date of Taylor v. Louisiana, the objection could have
4 been raised even if it was not raised in a particular case.
5

Now, in the case of O'Connor v. Ohio -- and I'd

6 like to state right at the beginning that I don't believe
7 that our position requires the overruling of O'Connor v.
8 Ohio.
9

I think it requires a different look at the case.
But in O'Connor v. Ohio, the trial took place five

10 and a half months before Malloy v. Hogan, and I think that
11 it can fairly be said that the tools were not even available
12 for counsel to have constructed the argument.

It might be a

13 different case once Malloy v. Hogan had been decided.

The

14 court didn't have to deal with those types of questions and
15 split the difference between could have raised it or would
16 have raised it or should have raised it, when you're
17 operating under the deliberate bypass test.

But once you go

18 to the notion that the actions of counsel can bind a client,
19 then I think you have to look at it in a different light.

20

The decision in O'Connor v. Ohio, of course, was

21 the decision that was cited by the appellate court as to why
22 the result was dictated that counsel should not anticipate a
23 future development of the law.

But I think if you look at

24 Ohio law in a real sense, the question could have been
25 raised.

I'm not going to deny that it was difficult* I
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

merely say that the grounds were there that counsel could

2

have raised the question.

3

First of all, In Re Winship had been decided five

4

years prior to the development in these cases.

5

Wilbur had been decided three months prior to the trial in

6

Hr. Isaac's case.

7

first appellate court decision in Ohio that held the

8

Robinson way was December 24, 1974, which was well prior to

9

the trials in these cases.

10

Mullaney v.

There was discussion of this issue.

The

If you look at the State v. Robinson opinion

11

itself, it makes reference to the 1979 Technical Committee

12

Report on the proposed criminal reform.

13

reference to a Law Journal article, "Affirmative Defenses in

14

Ohio", after Mullaney v. Wilbur.

15

about that is that the Law Review article starts out with

16

the proposition that the legislature did not intend to

17

change the law, but then concludes arguing that Mullaney v.

18

Wilbur should have dictated the result.

19

There’s also

And the curious thing

I would invite the Court to look at that Law

20

Review article and see whether or not an Ohio counsel could

21

have raised the question in this time period.

22

There's one other thing that I'd like to note with

23

respect to the question of "could have raised it."

That is

24

the argument that has been made on behalf of the respondent

25

Bell that self defense inherently requires the state to
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 disprove that defense.
2

That argument, which I will submit is not correct

3 either based on Ohio law or on this Court's decisions in
4 Patterson v. New York or Rivera v. Delaware, doesn't depend
5 at all on the change in the law.

The argument, could it be

6 constructed accurately according to Ohio law now, could have
7 been constructed according to Ohio law then.

Robinson

8 didn't change that at all.
9

Our concern is that a limitation of Wainwright to

10 the strategic decision relieves counsel of the traditional
11 responsibility to not only his client, but to the court.

I

12 think the Supreme Court of Ohio in State v. Humphries summed
13 it up very succinctly when they said that there is a
14 traditional relationship between court and counsel which
15 enjoins upon counsel the duty to raise an issue before the
16 court rather than to, by its silence, lead it into
17 commission of error.
18

I'd also point out that our argument does not

19 depend upon the ultimate success or lack of success in

20 raising the issue.

The phrasing in Wainwright v. Sykes is

21 that if a person thinks that the actions of the trial court
22 are about to deprive it of constitutional error, then he has
23 a duty to object.

Not that he knows that the actions of the

24 trial court are about to deprive him of a constitutional
25 right.
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I would refer the court to Judge Poole's

2

dissenting opinion in Myers v. State of Washington which is

3

cited in our reply brief, because I think he very succinctly

4

points out our position.

5

whether or not counsel would have raised the question as a

6

murky epistemology.
Who is to say what factor will set off the

7

8

He refers to the question of

creative light bulb that will lead to new development in the

9 law?

It could be the creation of a new statute, it could be

10

a development in another state, it could be the pendancy of

11

a case in this Court.
It could be any one of numerous factors, and I

12
13

think that if you apply a "would have raised" you’re merely

14

stating a result and not a test.

15

attorneys did not object.

16

to why, and there’s no argument made that they could not

17

have raised it.

It’s obvious here that the

There’s no explanation offered as

I think our distinction flows directly from

18
19

Wainwright v. Sykes.

20

decision is that once counsel is either retained or

21

appointed for a criminal defendant, that the whole range of

22

strategic and tactical decisions is entrusted to that

23

cou nsel.

24
25

I think them major premise of that

I also think that the result is fully justified by
the state’s interest in finality.

There comes a point in

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

time when society and the individual 's interest in finality

2

far outweigh any possibility of enhanced reliability on

3 another trial.
4

QUESTION*

Counsel, you're suggesting then that

5 you almost need to have a spectrum of cases in order to make
6

an assessment of cause and prejudice.

Like Taylor against

7 Louisiana, Duren against Missouri and Lee against Missouri,
8

one of which foreshadows a development or at least suggests

9 that there's a possibility of getting the argument accepted
10

by a court.

11

The second of which represents the acceptance by

12

the court, and the last of which says we aren't just going

13 to open the jail doors for people who were convicted for 40
14 yea rs.
MR. KARAS*

15

Well, I think there could be a whole

16 range of circumstances which could give rise to the
17 conclusion that somebody could have raised a particular
18 question.

I don’t particularly want to limit it to a clear

19 foreshadowing by a prior case, though that certainly fits
20

within the category of cases that I would consider to give

21

rise to a situation where counsel could have raised it.

22

might be a combination of cases, as opposed to one

It

23 particular case.
24

QUESTION*

Your position is that even if a state

25 supreme court has said the instruction should never be given
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 just the day before a trial, the counsel should have raised
2 it the next day in another case.
3

MR. KARASi

If it were a situation in which

4 counsel could have raised it, yes.
5

QUESTION;

Well yes, he could have raised it, and

6 he could always ask the court to overrule its decision.
7

MR. KARAS;

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. KARAS;

That's correct, Your Honor.
That's your position.
Our position is that you have to look

10 to the law to see if at the time that the case was tried,
11 whether or not a competent counsel could have raised the
12 question.
13

I would specifically, Mr. Justice White, I would

14 refer to Brady v. the United States.

I think there is a

15 cogent quote there to the extent that a voluntary plea of
16 guilty intelligently entered, in light of the law in
17 existence at the time, does not become vulnerable simply
18 because a later decision makes the initial premise seem
19 faulty.
20

Now, that was the case in which the waiver was of

21 the person's individual rights, but it was done at the
22 advice of counsel.

The premise of Wainwright is that with

23 respect to trial type decisions, those things are entrusted
24 to counsel, and I don't see why there should be a
25 distinction in the question of waiver between the guilty

16

1

plea situation and the situation at trial.
QUESTION;

2
3

General Karas, do you concede there was

a constitutional violation?
MR. KARAS;

4

No, I do not, Mr. Justice Stevens.

I

5

think an example might help to illustrate our position in

6

this case.

7

state of Oregon had enacted a new statute which was later

8

interpreted in a state case to change the burden of proof on

9

the affirmative defense of insanity to a preponderance of

Assume that subsequent to Leland v. Oregon, the

10

the evidence.

11

many of counsel in the state of Oregon -- you had a somewhat

12

similar situation to what happened here in Ohio.

13

And that the change was not initially seen by

You might say with respect to the instruction that

14

was given, that it was an error of sate law.

15

see how you can say that it's an error of fundamental

16

justice when it’s the same instruction which, in Leland v.

17

Oregon, was held to not violate fundamental fairness.

18

But I don't

I think there's a distinction to be drawn between

19

a decision which overcomes a defect in the factfinding

20

process as opposed to one which creates an enhancement of

21

the factfinding process, and I refer the court to Gosa v.

22

Mayden in which the court refused to hold O'Callahan v.

Parker retroactive.

What you're saying is there's no

1 constitutional right to have laws retroactively applied.
2 Changes in the law retroactively applied.
3

MR. KARAS:

The difficulty that the state has with

4 the argument that if the state creates a law in a certain
5 fashion that it must apply it is that I don’t see where you
6 draw a distinction -7

QUESTION:

8 differently.

Let me ask you the question a little

What do you understand their constitutional

9 claim to be?
10

MR. KARAS:

Well, I understand the argument from

11 the appellate court to have been that once Ohio passed
12 2901.05 that they created an element of the crime of the
13 absence of the affirmative defense.

I don't think that that

14 is justified by looking at Ohio law.
15

In State v. Poole, the Supreme Court of Ohio

16 specifically said that an affirmative defense is an excuse
17 or justification usually provable for the most part through

MR. KARAS;

The Ohio court has specifically held

The state now attempts to deny Lincoln Isaac a new

24 trial because he failed to object to this change which
25 occurred some ten months after his trial.

Because Criminal

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Rule 30 is not rationally related to the principle of
2 retroactivity, it appears that imposition of this
3 contemporaneous objection rule results in an arbitrary and
4 selected denial of retroactive benefits to some, in
5 contravention of the equal protection clause of the United
6 States Constitution.
7

In all cases after January 1, 1974, all judges and

8 all juries were misinformed as to who had to prove
9 self-defense.

Defendants, who were found guilty by

10 misinformed judges were permitted new trials under the case
11 of State v. Myers.

That judge was permitted to apply the

12 same facts of the case to the changed law with the
13 possibility of a changed verdict.
14

However -- and that is despite counsel's failure

15 to object.

However, those defendants who were found guilty

16 by misinformed juries were not granted new trials.

They

17 were not permitted the opportunity to apply the same facts
18 to the changed law with the possible result of a changed
19 verdict.

MR. KINGSLEY;

They could

16 respect to self-defense.
17

MR. KINGSLEY*

I don't disagree with you.

My

18 premise is -- we're starting at a different starting point.
19 The state of Ohio found it necessary under state principles

20 to make it retroactive.

Not constitutional principles.

Well, you think if the state says that

22 the burden hereafter — the burden under the Ohio law is on

25 self-defense, that they have to make it retroactive?

The position of the state seems to be that the

The purpose of Criminal Rule 30, the paramount

I would simply point out that the

2 lowe courts have found no question of exhausting state
3 remedies.

I don't believe that that defense was ever

Also, it was indicated that the record before the

I think that's certainly true of Mr. Isaac’s

it's certainly true of my client, Mr. Hughes.

But as

9 we indicated in the brief, there's no transcript before

11

this

there's nothing in the record to indicate whether Mr.

Bell’s counsel did or did not object.
Turning to the Sykes question, I think if we focus

12

13 on

Sykes, we see that in the line of cases beginning with

14 Davis and going through Sykes,

none of those cases dealt

15 with the fundamental integrity of the guilt-determining
16 process.

In Sykes, for example, we're talking about a

17 voluntary - not even a voluntary issue -- of a prophylactic
18 rule under Miranda.
19

In none of those cases did we have the factual

20 basis for the error in the record.
21 specifically, in Wainwright v.

11

a couple of points.

The Poole case that my friend Mr. Karas

12

makes reference to, is a 1973 Ohio Supreme Court case.

13

did not cite it in our brief; he does cite it in his brief,

14

and he quotes sections from it.

16

commentators have said this is true.

And part of the language he

into an argument that I haven't advanced,

22 but it tracks closely to Mr. Kingsley's retroactivity
23

question.

I wouldn't say fundamental error as much as error

24

that affects the accuracy of the factfinding process.

25

I think that that’s a very similar rationale to the test of

And

4

And I think what we have to look at is when we

5 consider the jury, not just is this an error in and of
6 itself, or even is it a constitutional error, but is this
7 the type of error that raises serious questions about the
8 accuracy of the jury in performing its function in making
9 findings of fact and determining guilt or innocence.
10

I think while we, I suppose, would have to go

11 through a whole continuum of examples, I don't think there's
12 any question that when the burden of proof is shifted,
13 whether that burden of proof is required by state statute or
14 is required by federal constitutional law, that that does
15 impinge upon the varying -16

QUESTION;

You really are submitting that if the

17 Ohio Supreme Court imposes a rule for the benefit of the
18 defendant under the state constitution and says well, we
19 understand it’s not required by the federal constitution,

20 and if that rule would, in your words, seriously affect the
21 accuracy of the factfinding process, that the federal
22 constitution requires its retroactivity?

That's what you're

23 suggesting.
24

QUESTION;

I suppose I hesitate, Your Honor, only

25 because —

MR. AYNES;

3

Well isn’t that what your argument is?
I stumble over the word retroactivity,

Your Honor.
QUESTION;

4

Well, would you get the benefit of it

-- must you get the benefit of it under the federal

6

Constitution, even though your case was tried before the new

7

rule was put in?
MR. AYNES;

8
9

true.

I can answer that yes and say that's

I'd like to clarify it only from this point.

One of

10

the problems we have in the whole Ohio system, I submit to

11

the Court, is confusion over where the source of this right

12

comes from.

I think.

And that confusion was indicated in the brief,

and this is not a guote; the first two were quotes -- but we

19

can't really have a good faith argument about what this

20

statute means.

We can't really have --

The Ohio Supreme Court never uses the term

21

22

retroactivity in any of its cases.

Solicitor General in

their amicus brief argues -- and I understand the argument

24

-- they come in and argue that this right stems from the

25

statute.

And we don't really have a retroactive problem at

Now of course, the problem with that is I can

2
3

impeach that position, it seems to me, by the Ohio Supreme

4

Court’s own decision in State v. Rogers.

5

as you said it was in 1976 in Robinson, how did you, the

6

Ohio Supreme Court, make that mistake in State v. Rogers in

7

1975 when you told us it didn't change the burden of proof?
And I think the only satisfactory answer that I

10

have been able to come up with to that is it's perhaps
analogous to this optical illusion that folks have -QUESTION:

11
12

If it’s as clear

self-defense didn’t result from any federal pressure, did it?
MR. AYNES:

13

Well, as I read the state supreme

14

court's opinion, the federal issue was raised, and they said

15

we have the power to resolve this without addressing the

16

implications of Mullaney, an therefore we’re going to do it

MR. AYNES:

They did it as a matter of state law.

reason.

In the subsequent cases, State v. Jones, the state

of Ohio Supreme Court said we're not talking about an

evidentiary rule here; we’re talking about a substantive

element.

5

of proof based on ex post facto position .

In that case they struck down changing the burden

What they’re saying, in effect, is that this goes

6
7

to the very integrity of the trial process.

What I’m

8

suggesting to the Court is, for example, we can even track

9

back to an analogy between this Court's cases, say, in

10

Patterson, that basically says the state has great freedom

11

in defining what the elements are going to be, what the -QUESTION;

12

But the Ohio Supreme Court has never

13

said the absence of self-defense is an element of the crime,

14

has it?

15

MR. AYNES;

16

QUESTION;

17
18

They have not — no, Your Honor.
They just said the state has to prove

it.
MR. AYNES;

Correct, Your Honor.

I think it’s

19

fair to say this, though, about what the Ohio Supreme Court

20

has said and what they haven’t said.

21

you’re absolutely correct, they have never said that it

22

negates an element of crime, and they've never said that its

23

absence is an element of crime.

24
25

They have never --

What they have said, though, in the Chas, Abner
and Jones cases that we’ve cited and quoted to this Court,
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is that when the jury makes its decision about guilt or

2

innocence# they consider all of the evidence.

3

of all of that evidence, they consider whether or not they

4

acted in self-defense.

And as part

Now, I point out this is very distinguishable from

5

6

Leland.

In Leland the insanity case, of course, the

7

statutory scheme was that you considered guilt or innocence;

8

once you decide the person is guilty, you go on to consider

9

insanity as a separate element.

The three Ohio Supreme

10

Court cases that post-date this statute all make it very

11

clear Ohio doesn't do that.

12

QUESTION;

But the defense claim — if defense is

13

the right word — in Leland against Oregon, was in the

14

nature of confession and avoidance clearly, was it not?

15

MR. AYNES*

16

QUESTION*

Yes, Your Honor, in the Leland case.
Now, in your response to Mr. Justice

17

White two questions back, equal protection was the route by

18

which you get to your position when it's a state law, not a

19

federal question that you're relying on.

think that even under this case —

That’s what I want to be sure about.

How do you get there other than by equal protection?
MR. AYNES*

I think in terms of establishing a

substantive constitutional violation, I think we probably

]

1 have at least two positions on that.

The one is that while

2 the state may be free to allocate burden of proof and to
3 define

the elements of the crime, once it makes

it

4 allocation, this is so important it can’t depart from

that

5 without violating due process.
6

QUESTION;

What about Sunburst, where

thisCourt

7 said a state was free to make its decision prospective only
8 or retroactively only.
9

MB. AYNES;

Well, Your Honor, I think — you’re

10 talking about a question of state law, the court is then
11 free to make that decision?
12

QUESTION;

13

MR. AYNES;

Yes.
I think that's true, but I think what

14 is Ohio is back in the position is perhaps Mullaney v.
15 Wilbur, where this court says, in effect, you don’t have to
16 have voluntary manslaughter; you could just have murder one,
17 murder two.

But if you do choose to have voluntary

18 manslaughter, then there are certain consequences to that
19 which due process mandates.

20

And I think that’s what we're saying here.

That

21 you may not have to accept -- you know, quite frankly, we
22 think they do have to accept burden of proof.

But even if

23 we were not to reach that point, you may not have to accept
24 the burden of proof, but once the state sets the agenda and

25 says, in effect, to prove a man guilty we must prove these
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 things; any departure from that is a due process violation.
2

And, of course, I think, we have the second

3 position and that is, unlike insanity, no one has a right to
4 be insane.

If you commit an act that would otherwise be a

5 crime, the absence of intent may or may not have bearing
6 upon whether you committed that crime.

But under

7 self-defense you do have a right to act in self-defense.
8 The state cannot deprive you of that right.
9

QUESTION;

You mean a state must, under our

10 federal Constitution, provide a defense of self-defense?
11

MR. AYNES:

Yes, Your Honor.

I don't believe our

12 case must necessarily stand or fall in that position.

But

13 we have taken the position — and I think I'm prepared to
14 defend that position even though there are no decisions from
15 this Court -- saying that's true, that you have a
16 constitutional right of self-defense.
17

QUESTION;

Well, there certainly are no cases from

18 this Court -19

MR. AYNES;

No, there are not. Your Honor.

But if

20 the state tells me, for example, that to refrain from
21 criminal conduct I must stand here and allow someone to

22 assail me and take my life, it seems to me that that's state
23 action depriving me of life without due process.

If it

24 says, in effect, I must let someone commit a crime rather
25 than defend myself, it seems to me that's a violation of

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

cruel and unusual punishment.

And I could go on with right

2

of privacy and other constitutional bases.

3

I simply point out on the Sykes issue that this

4

Court indicated by citing Henry-Mississippi that in every

5

case you must look to the specific interests that are

6

supposed to be advanced by the contemporaneous objection

7

rule.

8

And two of them don’t exist here.

9

Those interests generally coalesce into three parts.

We don't have any need to preserve testimony or to

10

take testimony to make the record here.

We also don’t have

11

any evidence of sandbagging.

12

indicated in his petition before the Sixth Circuit that the

13

counsel could justify we lied here.

14

indication, no allegation that these counsel deliberately

15

withheld these charges or that they were trying, in effect,

16

to reserve error for a later time.

My friend Mr. Karas has

We've had no

17

The only interest the state has here is finality,

18

and we’re suggesting to the Court that even finality, while

19

it may be of considerable interest, could never alone

20

outweight the defendant's interest, when we have an error of

21

this magnitude.

22

I think also there's been some discussion here of

23

futility, and I'd point out particularly in favor of my

24

client Mr. Hughes that we had a binding decision from the

25

Ninth District Court of Appeals which is unreported but
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

we've reproduced it in the addendum that we lodged with the

2 clerk's office which interpreted the statute prior to Mr.
3

Hughes' trial and said, in effect, the statute didn't change

4

it.
The state's interest here is avoiding retrials,

5

6

and all I’m suggesting to you is while futility is generally

7

discussed in terms of cause, we would like the Court to

8

focus here on futility in terms of the adequacy of the state

9

grounds.

If the judge, in theory, could not have given that

10

instruction, it serves no purpose to raise the objection and

11

it becomes futile.

12

under the exhaustion requirement which is comity-based,

13

neither should we require futile acts here.

14

And just as we don't require futile acts

Of course, as we’ve also tried to indicate in our

15

briefs, if the Court goes beyond the adequacy of the state

16

grounds, finds it adequate, wants to look to cause and

17

prejudice, we think that we've demonstrated cause and

18

prejudice here.

19

I’d also point out that we have some -- both of

20

these individuals filed their petitions pro se in the

21

district court.

22

I guess I did enter one of those cases after the

23

magistrate's recommendation -- but decided those cases

24

without any type of evidentiary hearing.

25

reason I think that that is relevant here is that this Court

The district court cited those decisions --

And the only

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

seems to suggest in its recent case in Jenkins v. Anderson

2

that in order to resolve a cause type of question, there may

3

be a necessity for an evidentiary hearing, and none was held

4

in any of these cases.

5

So I'm suggesting to the Court that I think the

6

record here is clear enough under all these facts that we've

7

demonstrated cause without that hearing, but if the Court

8

were to determine otherwise, then we'd suggest that perhaps

9

one of the proper remedies would be to remand for an

10
11

evidentiary hearing.
I think it's also important to point out, in terms

12

of assessing what counsel's opportunity was, that the only

13

two opinions that speak directly to these points are from

14

the judges closest to what was happening in the state of

15

Ohio come from the Second District Court of Appeals in Ohio;

16

again, an unreported case, State v. Hamilton and it's in the

17

addendum, where they characterized this that objecting would

18

have been a vain act.

19

And also, Judge Peck, senior status on the Sixth

20

Circuit who authored the plurality decision, who was a

21

former Ohio common pleas judge and also former Ohio Supreme

22

Court judge, and he, too, looking at this said in the

23

context of these cases, it would have been vain or it would

24

have been futile to make this objection.

25

QUESTION:

May I ask you to go back to your
U5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 constitutional theory for just a second.

Your first theory,

2 as I understand it was that if the Ohio Supreme Court
3 changes the burden of proof, it must make the new rule
4 available to everyone who was tried after the statute was
5 passed in 1974.
6

Is that right?

MR. AYNES:

Yes, Your Honor, on the theory that

7 the agenda was set by the statute.
8

QUESTION:

All right.

Supposing you had no

9 statute at all, and the Ohio Supreme Court just announced a
10 new rule of law that the self-defense burden of proof shall
11 be different henceforth.

Would that have had to have been

12 applied retroactively?
13

MR. AYNES;

If I were to abandon my other

14 constitutional claim and admit that that is purely a
15 question of state law then no, I don’t believe they’re
16 required to apply it retroactively.
17

QUESTION;

Why do they have to apply it

18 retroactively when it's a statutory interpretation and not
19

20

when it's a non-statutory question?
MR. AYNES;

I think you can track that on either

21 due process or almost an ex post facto analysis and say that
22 once you make that determination on the very important issue
23 of who bears the burden of proof on self-defense, the state
24 locks itself into that position.

It's very similar to this

25 Court’s decision in Hicks v. Oklahoma where the state tried
46

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to argue this is merely a matter of sentencing.

And the

2 Cour came back and said no, once you make that
3

determination, any departure from that is going to be a

4

violation of due process.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

6 further,
7

Do you have anything

Mr. Karas?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF SIMON B. KARAS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - Rebuttal

8
9

Thank you.

MR. KARAS:

Four points real quickly.

One, I

10 think it's important to emphasize that the Supreme Court of
11

Ohio specifically said in State v. Robinson that they were

12 reaching this decision on the basis of state law.

I think

13

the questions from the various Justices point out that if it

14

is a question of state law, then it is for the state to

15

determine how far it is going to apply its retroactivity.

16

Now, the state here I think had a valid reason as

17

opposed to arbitrary and capricious, as called by the

18

appellate court for not making this applicable to those who

19

had not objected, and that is that the result in this case

20 is absolutely
21

22
23
24
25

devastating in terms of its impact on the

administration of justice.
Certainly, a number of persons are going to obtain
new trials as a result of the holding by the court below.

10 capricious about drawing a —
11

I didn't say there was.

I just say

12 that that is -- part of the devastating impact is
13 self-imposed.
14

MR. KARAS*

To the extent that those cases are

15 entitled to relief under Ohio law, then those cases -16

QUESTION*

There is certainly more than one of

17 them, aren't there?
18

MR. KARAS*

I'm sure that's correct, Your Honor.

19

One aspect of finality that I would like to

20 illustrate, and I think Ohio was lucky in this case because
21 we're dealing with a relatively short time period.

In the

22 Frady case, which the Court will hear next, there were 16
23 years involved between the time of the initial trial and the

24 finding of constitutional error.
25

QUESTION*

Is there any claim here that it goes

refer the Court to the Carter decision in which a

4 petition for rehearing en banc is still
5 appellate court,
6

pending in the

and of course, they relied on the Isaacs

case for finding cause in the failure to object in that

7 case, and it could apply backwards.

One thing I would like to point out and that is

8

9 the fact that Mr.

Hughes and Mr. Isaac have actually been

10

released, and I think that illustrates the need for finality

11

in the system.

12

from prison, they have gone back to their jobs or whatever,

Here we are after they have been released

13 and we are still litigating the question as to whether or
14 not their convictions were valid.

I submit that is a result

15 that should not be allowed under our system of justice.

22

MR. KARAS;

As a practical matter, Your Honor, I

23 don't believe the state would retry it, nor would they have
24 the opportunity -25

QUESTION;

Legally, they could be -- they could be

lawfully retried now.

2

MR. KARASi

3

QUESTION;

Legally they could be.
The question of whether you can find

4

your witnesses and all that sort of thing has nothing to do

5

with the legal issues.

6

MR. KARASi

7

QUESTION;

No, that's correct.
What would the habeas corpus court's

8

order be if somebody has been released?

9

or release them, or they're already released?
MR. KARASi

10
11

14
15
16
17
18

I suppose it would be a predicate for

an expungement.
QUESTION;

12

13

Either retry them

Either -- just order expungement, is

that it?
MR. KARASi

Probably under the Ohio law if they're

a first offender.
QUESTIONi

You had three other points you were

going to make?
MR. KARASi

The second thing is that Mr. Aynes has

19

referred to the nature of the claim.

I think that is what

20

gives rise to the court of appeals' argument about presumed

21

prejudice, and the only point that I would make there is a

22

quote from Davis v. United States.

23

prejudice, which supports the existence of the right, is not

24

inconsistent with the holding that actual prejudice must be

25

shown in order to obtain relief from a statutory waiver for

"The presumption of

50

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 failure to assert it in a timely manner."
2

The third thing is State v. Abner I would assert

3 actually supports the state’s position.

The court there

4 held that there need not be a specific instruction on the
5 state’s burden to prove the absence of self-defense beyond a
6 reasonable doubt.

The argument there would be that if it

7 were an element of the offense, that would constitutionally
8 be required.

The only counter-argument that the respondents

9 have made is that the Ohio Supreme Court was acting
10 unconstitutionally there as well.
11

And the last thing is that the distinction of how

12 you separate the claimed state error here from any other
13 claimed state error.

If

14 that is more restrictive

the state has a speedy trial act
than what would be required by the

15 constitutional claim of speedy trial, can a habeas corpus
16 petitioner raise the failure of Ohio to have abided by the
17 state supreme court act,

the state speedy trial

18 anything other of the myriad
19

act or

range of decisions by which

state courts actually go beyond what is fundamentally

20 required by the constitution.
21

I just ask the Court to note that the Hughes case

22 provides writ granted on the basis of Isaacs; I expect that
23 if this decision is upheld you will have writ granted
