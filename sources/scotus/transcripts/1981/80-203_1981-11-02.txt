ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD P. SASLOW, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. SASLOW:

8 the Court,

the issue presented is whether the Commodity

9 Exchange Act provides
10 right to maintain a
11 4,

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please

persons such as the Currans an implied

civil action for damages under Section

the antifraud provisions of the Act in federal court.

12

In a broader sense, the issue is where is the line

13 to be drawn

that distinguishes between the proper scope of

14 judicial function in the
15 statutory language,
16 the

interpretation and application of

and what the Constitution defines to be

legislative prerogative, the enactment of substantive

17 rights and

federal statutes.
Very briefly, the facts are that the Currans

18

19 opened a commodity trading account with Merrill Lynch
20 1973.

The account was closed about a year later, having

21 sustained

22 the

substantial losses.

The Currans started suit in

United Sta*tes District Court for the Eastern District of

23 Michigan, claiming
24 suffered as a
25

in

civil damages alleged to have been

result of the fraud of Merrill Lynch.

In the Court of Appeals, the Court addressed sua

1 sponte and decided the issue of whether the statute creates
2 this implied remedy.

Over the dissent of Judge Philips, the

3 court concluded that there is such a remedy.
4

The Currans' claim is based on Section 4b of the

5 Commodity Exchange Act, a 1936 statute.

The 1936 Act was

6 broadly proscriptive, provided for criminal sanctions, and
7 granted some regulatory powers to the Secretary of
8 Agriculture.

There was no provision in that Act for any

9 private remedy in federal courts.

There was no language in

10 the statute creating such a right, and there was no
11 indication anywhere in the legislative history that Congress
12 ever considered, contemplated, or intended the existence of
13 such a right.
14

The 1936 Act contained Section 4c, savings clause,

15 which preserved to persons any rights or remedies they might
16 have under applicable state law.
17

The Commodity Exchange Act was amended in 1968,

18 very substantially in 1974, and again thereafter in 1978.
19 The 1974 amendment significantly broadened and strengthened
20 the regulatory control of the government over this sector of
21 the economy.

The 1974 amendments created the Commodity

22 Futures Trading Commission, which was designed to be an
23 expert agency with broad administrative, regulatory, and
24 enforcement and remedial powers.
25

The Commission was vested with the oversight of

Yes, sir.

Yes,

Mr.

Chief Justice.

Is it correct that they contend it was

They thought Congress was aware of the

12 existing private cause of action and found no need to enact
13 it.

Isn't that their argument?

14

MR. SASLOW;

They argue that there was an existing

15 private right of action.
16

QUESTION;

We dispute that there ever was.

But if they are right, then it wouldn’t

17 be an oversight that they didn't put it in.
18

MR. SASLOW;

Yes, it would still be an omission

19 from the statute that is purposeful.
20

QUESTION;

But not an oversight.

If they thought

21 they knew -- may they were wrong -- that there was an
22 existing private cause of action and they didn't change the
23 law deliberately, because they thought, we've already got a
24 remedy, it would not be fair to call that an oversight,
25 would it?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD F. SASLOW,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
NR. SASLOWi

ESQ.,

RESUMED

Kr. Chief Justice, and may it please

7 the Court, the Congress of the United States has since
8 devoted considerable attention,

1936

time, effort, and

9 draftsmanship to the creation of the Commodity Exchange
10 Act.

Yet the Respondents would ask this Court to disregard

11 that Congressional effort in this very key provision and
12 substitute the wisdom of this Court for that of the Congress
13 as to whether this substantive right, this private right of
14 action, should exist under this statute.
15

What Respondents ask in effect is for the Court to

16 exceed its judicial function and venture into the realm of
17 the legislative function..
18

This Court recently in Texas Industries versus

19Radcliffe Materials had occasion, speaking through the Chief
20 Justice, to discuss the fact that the creation of
21 substantive rights is a legislative function.

The Court

22 noted that it .is the Congress that is equipped to make these
23 kinds of policy decisions.
24

For example, in the consideration that preceded

25 the enactment of the Commodity Exchange Act, the Congress

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 heard testimony from witnesses representing many diverse
2 segments within the futures trading industry.

This

3 testimony, the hearings amounted to hundreds and hundreds of
4 pages of legislative history, and represented the
5 accumulation by the Congress of information, of the
6 interests, the opinions, the desires of all of these many
7 groups.
8

The decision of the Congress as to how those many

9 and often diverse interests could best be balanced and
10 mutually served, and how the futures industry and the
11 national economy could best be served through this Act is
12 set forth in the language, the provisions that the Congress
13 put into the Commodity Exchange Act.
14

The framers of our Constitution determined that

15 such policy decisions are to be made by elected
16 representatives, those who are politically accountable to
17 their constituents.
18

The judicial forum is unsuited to the making of

19 such policy decisions.

Courts are limited to the facts

20 presented to them by individual litigants in an adversary
21 posture.

The Court does not have free ranging source of

22 information to make such decisions.
23

QUESTION;

Mr. Saslcw, does Section Ub refer to

24 the obligation of the FCMs toward third parties in the
25 market generally, or only to their own customers?

3 the task of harmonizing apparent conflicts between different

5 individual case.
6

Where, as in this case, the statute itself is

7 clear, the Court need only consider the language and the
3 structure of the Act to answer the question, and the answer
9 to the question here is that there is no private right of
10 action contained within the statute.

Therefore, none exists,

23

(Pause.)

24

MR. SASLOW;

Justice Powell ,

I was addressing an

25 argument made by the Respondents that their cause of action

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

MR. .SASLOW;

25

MR. SASLOW;

Well, it was not their claim in the

1 court below.
2

QUESTION:

3

NF. SASLOW:

All right
We were addressing an

argument that

4 they made that if this Court does not grant a private right
5 of action in the federal courts, they would be without any
6 remedy whatever, and in addressing that point we just say
7 that they have one or the other depending on when their
8 claim accrued.
9

This Court’s recent decisions have

stressed the

10 limitations on the judicial role in the implication of
11 private rights under statutes that don't expressly provide
12 those rights.

What this Court has said is that it cannot

13 infer a private remedy under such a statute in the absence
14 of clear, persuasive evidence that such was the intent of
15 the Congress, yet the evidence that the Respondents rely on
16

in this case is evidence of the sort that this Court has

17 rejected as being probative of the existence of a private
18 remedy.
19

The Respondents argue that this is a comprehensive

20 regulatory statute providing various means of enforcement
21 and redress.

They argue further that it is the apparent

22 will of the Congress to provide strong enforcement, and
23 therefore it would advance that same Congressional purpose
24 for the Court to imply an additional form of remedy.

This

25 Court has, however, held otherwise, acknowledging that when

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 there is a comprehensive, broad statute providing for varied
2 remedies, it creates a presumption that the Congress knew
3 what it was doing and enacted those remedies that it
4 intended, and remained silent as to those remedies that it
5 did not intend.
6

7 expressly provides for the jurisdiction of the United States
8 Court to contribute to the enforcement of the statute.

In addition, the trading privileges of a

It is argued by the Respondents that Section 4b

8 should be implied.
9 reasons.
10 incorrect.

This argument is unavailing for two

The first of those reasons is that it is factually
As I discussed a few minutes ago, the protection

11 was directed to the marketplace in general, and to the
12 extent there was any particular favored class, it was
13 basically the farmers.
14-

The argument is also legally insufficient.

Even

15 if people such as the Respondents were a favored class at
16 whom the statute's benefits were aimed, that still is
17 insufficient to create a substantive right to proceed in the
18 federal courts.
19

The Respondents also seek to invoke the holdings

20 of approximately four United States District Courts that
21 recognize an implied right of action, using the tort pro se
22 analysis of Rigsby and Borak, an analysis that this Court
23 has since categorically rejected in Touche Ross and
24 Transamerica.

It is argued that the Congress was aware of,

25 approved of, and in effect adopted these decisions, and now

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 this Court is debarred from taking that away since it is not

3

This argument is factually incorrect and

4 constitutionally unsound.

It is factually incorrect because

5 it is simply not supportable that the Congress as a whole
6 was aware of, spent any time considering, or acted in
7 reliance on the existence of a right found by these four
8 courts in Illinois, Minnesota, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania.
9

The decisions were constitutionally unsound and

10 Congress was simply not well aware of them.

There are

11 hundreds of pages of legislative history underlying the 1974
12 amendments, and there are a very few, very scattered, some
13 ambiguous, some clearly perjorative references to these
14 cases, but there is nothing that focuses on them and
15 represents any Congressional intent recognizing this to be

5 think Rigsby might have nonetheless been correctly decided
6 even under the Court’s current principles.
7

QUESTION:

Under your more or less constitutional

8 argument that the Court has no power to do this, it seems to
9 me Rigsby is clearly wrong.
10

MR. SASLOW;

Well, my argument is that the Court

11 cannot say that this statute creates a duty, that duty has
12 been breached, this plaintiff has been injured,

therefore he

13 has a right to proceed in federal court for a damage
14 remedy.

I think this Court has in recent terms held

15 that can't be done.

that

What can constitutionally be done is

16 for the Court to resolve ambiguities and infer in some cases
17 a right of action even where none is expressly provided.
18

In Rigsby, for example, one of the provisions of

19 the Safety and Appliance Act at issue in that case said that
20 employees shall not be deemed to have assumed the risk.

A

21 provision that takes away a legal defense would seem to
22 create a reasonable inference that that defense must be able
23 to be asserted in some forum, and I think there might be an
24 inference to be drawn there that a private right of action
25 was intended .

19

QUESTION;

Well, don't you argue in your brief

20 that Cort and Ash was satisfied?
21

MR. SASLOW;

I think under the test that Cort v.

22 Ash establishes, there is no private right of action.

I

23 think the degree of inquiry that is required by Cort v. Ash
24 is unnecessary in a case where there is not some indication
25 within the statute that there might have been a private

HR. SASLOW:

Why do you question it?
Because,

Justice Powell, when the

19 Courts are invited, as Cort v. Ash invites them, to consider
20 whether an additional private right of action would advance
21 the Congressional purpose, the Courts are then invited to
22 try to form a .subjective intent or a subjective idea of what
23 the Congressional purpose is and whether this additional
24 remedy might advance it, and I believe they are led into
25 making legislative policy decisions of the kind that should

In other words, you depend on the fact

Is that

12 it?

MR. SASLOW:

No, Mr. Chief Justice.

Isn't that

5 what you are arguing?
6

ME. SASLQW;

No, I am arguing that there was never

7 a cause of action in the federal courts, and after 1974
3 there was also a remedy in reparation and no remedy in state
9 court.

But there was never a right of action in the federal

10 court.
11

QUESTION;

Well, suppose that however much you

12 argue to the contrary, this Court or some court said, well,
13 at the time the 1974 statute was amended, prior to those
14 amendments there was a well recognized cause of action in
15 the federal courts.

At least the federal courts had been

All right.
Now, what would you say then?

And

ORAL ARGUMENT OFROBERT A. HUDSON, ESQ.,

And by the Second Circuit as well.

Very well.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. HUDSON*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8 the Court, in making the determination of whether a private
9 right of action exists under the Commodity Exchange Act, the
10 opinions of this Court instruct that the touchstone is

11 Congressional intent.

In this case, we submit that the

12 relevant inquiry is whether Congress in enacting the
13 substantive and extensive amendments to the Commodity
14 Exchange Act in 1974 intended to deny a private right of
15 action u nder Section 4b.
16

We believe this approach to be the correct one in

17 view of the circumstances surrounding the enactment of the
18 1974 legislation, circumstances which show that based on the
19 unanimous interpretation of Section 4b by the federal courts
20 and based upon the testimony provided to Ccnoress, and
21 statements made by our legislators, Congress perceived that
22 the Act afforded a private right of action.
23

Thus stated, we believe that the opinion below did

24 not, as this Court cautioned in Northwest Airlines versus
25 United States, fashion a new rule or provide a new remedy

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 which Congress decided not to adopt, but instead merely
2 interpreted a statute as continuing an existing remedy.

We

3 believe the attempt to couch this case in constitutional
4 terms is in fact to beg the very question that we have
5 before the Court, and exalt the proper exercise of this
6 Court's duty in interpreting a statute far beyond its plain
7 import.
8

This Court has stated on numerous occasions that

9 in construing a statute we look, first to the statutory
10 language, and particularly to the provisions made therein
11 for enforcement and relief.

While as in nearly every case

12 involving an implied right of action, there is no explicit
13 statutory language which would answer this question for us,
14 we believe the explicit terms of the statute are
15 particularly telling of Congressional intent in this case.
16

Section 4b is a customer-oriented antifraud

17 statute, very much like Section 10b of the Securities and
18 Exchange Act, interpreted by this Court in Superintendent of
19 Insurance, and Sections 206 and 215 of the Investment
20 Advisors Act, considered in Transamerica Mortaage Advisors.
21 The very language of Section 4b makes it clear that a
22 commodity brok.er's customers are the especial class intended
23 to be benefitted by that statute.
24

In Leist against Simplot, Judge Mansfield in his

25 dissenting opinion correctly observed that it is only a

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 customer who may bring a suit under Section 4b.

The express

2 terms of the statute find significant support in the
3 legislative history/ which shows that customer protection
4 was one of the, if not the overriding purpose of the
5 legislation.
6

However, as this Court has cautioned in California

7 versus Sierra Club, the question is not simply whether -8 who would benefit, but whether Congress intended to confer
9 federal rights upon those beneficiaries.

As to this issue,

10 the Petitioner and the Respondent are not in disagreement,
11 because as Petitioner states in his brief, there is no
12 reason for a court to speculate whether Congress intended
13 that persons aggrieved by violations of the Act be entitled
14 to recover damages.
15

Plainly, Congress did so intend.

And that

16 intention is specified in the express terminology of the
17 statute.

Sections 5a(11) and Section 14 of the Act create

18 respectively a private, voluntary arbitration mechanism and
19 an administrative reparations procedure to commodity
20 customers injured for a broker's violation of Section 4b.
21

Thus, we believe the express terms of the statute,

22 without regard to any other factors, conclusively
23 demonstrate that Congress enacted a federal statute
24 conferring federal duties upon commodity brokers toward
25 their customers, and that Congress intended that customers

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 would have recourse/

civil recourse for violations of that

2 statute.
3

Yet based upon the record as submitted to this

4 Court,
5 and

and we want to make that clear, the record supports,

we contend, that the claim of the Currans arose before

6 the effective date of the reparations procedure.
7 those facts,

no remedy is provided to the Currans.

8 Accordingly,

the remaining inquiry of whether Congress

9 intended

that those rights to which I have referred would be

10 supported through

private litigation must be determined by

11 reference to the language of the —
12

Ii

not to the language of

the statute, but through Congressional intent and the

13 factors

reflecting that intent, as this Court has outlined

against Ash.

24 view,
25

They simply, in our

cannot use reparations and they cannot use arbitration.
We believe, therefore, that it would be useful to

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 take a look very quickly to what precisely Congress did in
2 1974 with the Commodity Exchange Act.

In 1974, 19 new

3 sections were enacted; 27 sections were amended; and
4 excluding the severability clause, only five sections were
5 left undisturbed.

Section 4b was one of the sections that

6 was amended, yet the operative language upon which the
7 Respondents rely was left completely intact.
3

The changes to the 1974 Act -- in the 1974

9 legislation constituted a vast change in the scheme of
10 legislation, and expansion of federal regulation, and in the
11 means of providing redress for the violations.

So, we

12 believe, based on that very extensive modification, that the
13 intent to be discerned is the intent of the 1974 Congress.
14 This is a point which every court which has considered this
15 issue thus far has made.
16

In considering what the 1974 Congress intended

17 with regard to claims like the Currans’, we must recognize
18 that when Congress sat down to amend the statute, it was the
19 unanimous interpretation of the lower federal courts that a
20 private right of action was allowed under Section 4b.
21 Petitioner is unable to point to one single decision that
22 even suggests«that that would not be an appropriate result.
23

QUESTION:

Well, hr. Hudson, in the case of

24 Georgia against United States, decided about seven or eight
25 years ago, where the Voting Rights Act was renewed, the

4 been a matter of some controversy in this Court, was
5 repeatedly discussed.

any substantive modification.

We can only conclude,

7 then, that Allen correctly interpreted the Congressional
8 design when it held

that the Act gives broad interpretation

9 of the right to vote," at cetera.
10
11

Sow, was there that kind of discussion in the

1974

Congress ?

12

HE. HUDSON;

No, there was not. Justice Rehnquist.

13 In fact, the discussions in

the 1974 Congress did not get

14 into the specifics in terms of the cases that were decided,
15 however, we believe that even without that, we believe that
16 the conclusion which the Court reached in Cannon versus
17 Uni versity of Chicago, which was that -- the statement was
18 made that our legislators are presumed to know the law, in
19 addition to that general presumption, there was a
20 significant amount of
21 which we have outlined
22 Congress was told

testimony which was presented and
in our brief which shows that

that there was a right of action in the

23 courts.
24

For example, a statement by Hr. Alvin Donohue, of

25 the Minneapolis Grain Exchange,

to the effect that the facts

2 procedure -3

QUESTION!

These were lower courts, not the U. S.

4 Supreme Court, like the Allen case.
5

MR. HUDSON:

This is correct, Justice Sehnquist.

6 However, we believe that the emphasis which the Petitioner
7 is trying to place on that very fact is — overlooks what we
8 believe to be a very significant concept of statutory
9 construction to which this Court referred to in Cannon,
10 which is that it is not really the state of the law which is
11 governing, it is Congress's perception of the state of the
12 law.

Whether or not that perception is correct or not is of

13 no moment.

If Congress perceived that that private right of

14 action existed, that in fact is the most significant
15 indication of legislative intent.
16

QUESTION:

Well, by 1974, when this Congress

17 acted, ASTRAK had been decided,
18

MR. HUDSON:

19

QUESTION:

had it not?

It had.
Or within a month or so, and there we

20 had said that it was no longer open season on private rights
21 of action.
22

SR. .HUDSON:

This is correct, Justice Rehnquist.

231 think that the AMTRAX decision and the very, I relieve,
cogent questions that you are pointing out must be
conside red, but I think they must be consid ered in the

of the entire circumstances.

We believe that we

2 must weigh the factor that you have just mentioned with

the

3 fact that Congress was told on repeated occasions that
4 customers could go to Court in most instances by those very
5 individuals who were going to be governed by this Act.
6

As a matter of fact, one of the representatives of

7 the Petitioner made that very statement to Congress himself
8

in testimony.

9

It is

-- Therefore, the way that we believe that

10 factor is relevant
11 of
12

is that this Court has outlined a number

tools, accepted tools of statutory construction which

must be looked at.

I think the point that we are making,

13 there was this line of authority, Congress was told that
14 there was recourse to the courts —
15

QUESTION:

16

MR. HUDSON:

17 Justice White.

Well, was there any contrary authority?
There was not.

Not under Section 4b,

It was unanimous, and in fact the belief, we

18 believe, was so universal that it is even underscored by the
19 proceedings below in this case.
QUESTION:

20
21

Well, Mr. Hudson, is it your position

then that Congress anticipated these parallel remedies with

22 respect to

tho.se people who could use reparations?

23 respect to them, did they have a choice?

With

Or could they go

24 both ways at once?

32

MR. HUDSON;

You don't.

It would.

It would, because

11 reparations, we believe, was intended to provide an

13

QUESTION;

So you think that Congress anticipated

14 independent judgments by courts on commodities exchanges and
15 with no obligation -- if you filed in the court rather than
16 go for reparations, the court you filed in would have no
17 duty whatsoever to consider how the Commodities Exchange
18 Commission had construed its own statute.

This is correct.

In fact, this was

I definitely would.

The reason is

we

If that was not the case , then I

23 think we would have to pass that, we would have to lock at
24 the other circumstances, for example,

the way the

25 reparations remedy itself works.

36

1

Arbitration, which is one of the remedies

2 provided, is only allowable for claims below $15,000, and
3 must in any event be voluntary, certainly not the case if
4 you have no alternative.

And the Currans have no

5 alternative in this case, because while the Commodity
6 Futures Trading Commission Act, including Section 4b, became
7 effective on October 23rd,

1974, the reparations remedy did

8 not become effective for three months later, in January of
9 1975, and claims under reparations could not be filed for
10 one year thereafter, January,
11

1976.

So, while this type of a phase-in may certainly be

12 explainable in terms of allowing the CFTC to adopt its
13 regulations and prepare itself for its duties, it is
14 completely, we believe, had Congress intended to make that
15 an exclusive remedy, it would have logically made that
16 available to everyone who might come before the Commission.
17

At the same time, it strains credulity to believe

18 that Congress intended to immunize conduct violative of
19 Section

4b during that period prior to the time that

20 reparations would take effect.

This,

we believe,

is

21 governed by the very standard tool of statutory construction
22 that an unreasonable construction of a statute should yield
23 to the reasonable one.
24

So, unless this Court upholds the existence of a

25 private right of action, the Currans will be without any

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 remedy, and we believe that the duty which Congress imposed
2 upon the Petitioner will become entirely precatory,
3 certainly not a wise decision, we believe.
4

Now, consideration of the reparations procedure

5 itself shows, even if it was available, shows that it would
6 not be adeguate because of the point made in response to
7 Justice Stevens' question, that there is no review of a
8 denial by the CFTC, and in fact in

1978 Congress analogized

9 reparations as similar to the operation of a small claims
10 court, certainly not the k.ind of desciption that would
11 contemplate an exclusive remedy.
12

QUESTION;

Well, your point is basically that the

13 CFTC and the federal courts simply are proceeding on two
14 parallel, never meeting plains,

because neither of them has

15 to pay any attention to the other.
16

MS. HUDSON:

Is that right?

Well, I would not say that. Justice

17 Rehnguist, because certainly I believe that decisions by the
18 Commodity Futures Trading Commission could be viewed as
19 precedent and applied just as decisions in the other
20 courts.

However, I would point out that with regard to

21 securities legislation, while the SEC does not have a
22 customer remecfy procedure of this nature, there are various
23 different courts interpreting the law, and certainly with
24 regard to enforcement matters the SEC is interpreting the
25 law as well.

That has not posed a problem.

I don't believe

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 it

would pose a problem in this case.

2

QUESTION:

Well, but the SEC has been rebuffed a

3 number of times in this Court, has it not?
4

ME. HUDSON:

Indeed it has, and based certainly on

5 some of the decisions, including those that were cited here,
6 I

believe, properly, but the fact of the matter is that

7 Congress has in fact permitted the SEC to perform a certain
8 function

in that regard.

It has also permitted the courts

9 to perform a certain function, and I believe that there has
10

not been an inconsistency in that.
Finally, we would like to point out very briefly

11

12 that the underlying

purpose of the 197U legislation, which

13 was customer protection, would clearly be frustrated by
14 denying the Currans the right to pursue their claims, but in
15 addition to that there are other ramifications.
16

For example,

the volume of cases with the

17 Commission has become so great that the backlog there is now
18 two to three years.

This hardly comports with Congress's

19 intent to make the reparations remedy an expeditious one.
20 And

21

—
QUESTION:

Would you say the same line of

22 reasoning would enable someone to bypass the EEOC and go

23 directly into court?
24

ME. HUDSON:

By itself, absolutely not, Justice

25 Eehnguist, but once again, we believe this case presents a

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 situation where we have a confluence of factors which we
2 believe is entirely consistent with the prior decisions of
3 this Court that when considered all together show that
4 Congress intended that remedy to continue.

Uny one of them

5 by themselves, I will readily concede, would not clearly
6 show that intent, but we believe that when you have them all
7 together, you must go forward and find that there is a right
8 of action.

10 not cited in our brief. Justice Holmes, then Judge Holmes of
11 the First Circuit Court of Appeals, stated that it is not an
12 adequate discharge of a court's duty to say, we see what you
13 are driving at, but you have not said it, and therefore we
14 will go on as before.
15

QUESTION:

16 Judicial Court of Massachusetts.

QUESTION:

Well, let me ask you this.

Let's

agree with the implication of my question that

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 after Cort 7. Ash and before the 1974 Act, it would be very
2 difficult indeed to infer a cause of action under the 1936
3 Act.
4

MR. SULLIVAN;

I think it would certainly be more

5 difficult than under Rigsby.
6

2UESTI0N:

Let's assume we agree on that.

How do

7 you justify putting the burden of proof on proponents of the
8 view that there is on implied cause of action, understanding
9 Cort to have said, in effect, that the lower courts that
10 interpreted the 1936 Act as providing a cause of action were
11 wrong?

In other words, if they were wrong, and in effect

12 you have conceded it would be a very close question, where
13 does the burden lie here today?
14

MR. SULLIVAN;

Kell, I think it is difficult to

15 say that those courts were necessarily wrong, because they
16 are applying a different test, but as someone said in
17 response to a question earlier, they might have gotten to
18 the same place by a different test.
19

QUESTION;

By what test?

Assuming Cort v. Ash

20 came down prior to the 1974 Act, what test in light of Cort
21 would have sustained a private cause of action being
22 inf erred on th.e basis of the language, the legislative
23 history of the 1936 Act?
24

MR. SULLIVAN;

Kell, I think that first of all,

25 under Cort, I would have to start by saying that Section 4t

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 was enacted for the especial benefit of futures traders.
2

QUESTION;

3

MB. SULLIVAN;

But 4b has not been changed.
That is correct, and I would say

4 that in 1936, that was the case.

That is how I would start

5 the process.
6

QUESTION;

That would meet one of the four factors

7 in Cort, but only one.
8

MR. SULLIVAN;

That's correct.

And the second

9 factor is the one that might give us some trouble, as far as
10 Congress ’s -11

QUESTION;

It will give you a whole lot of

12 trouble, in view of the emphasis in your brief on intention.
13

MR. SULLIVAN;

Well, it would, and I concede that,

14 but the problem is that in 1936 , when Congress enacted the
15 language that it did in 4b, it wasn't aware of the Cort
16 test, obviously, and it was operating under Rigsby.
17 Presumably, the Congress then thought that if it were
18 appropriate to have an implied right of action under Section
19 4b, the courts would imply that.
20

I don’t think that there is any -- I think it is

21 very difficult to go back and to see what Congress did in
22 1936 and to analyze it in terms of today's law, and that is
23 basically the emphasis of our brief, and I think justifiably
24 so.

\
25

QUESTION;

You mean, I gather, Mr. Sullivan, that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Rigsby stood for the proposition that the mere fact that the
2 statute was enacted for the benefit of a particular class
8 without more, required the implication of a cause of action

18

QUESTION:

Well,

Mr.

Sullivan, you say it didn't

19 require it but it would have supported it.

One court could

20 have come out against it and another court could have come
21 out in favor, and both would have been right under your
22 theory.
23
24 accurate.

MR. SULLIVAN:

Well, I think that is probably

I think depending on the circumstances of a

25 particular case, although I have to say that this is a

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 matter of legal history, to say how somebody would apply
2 Rigsby.

I am really not an expert in that.

However, I

3 think, that there was a good deal of discretion left to the
4 courts under Rigsby to determine whether the implication of
5 a particular remedy, one among many, presumably, would be
6 felicitous in terms of the administration of the statute and
7 the goals that the statute was directed at furthering.
8

This is a very different world that we are talking

9 about in terms of what the law was when Congress enacted
10 this section in 1936 and what the law is today, let alone
11 what the law was in 1974 when Congress amended the statute.
12

QUESTION;

You do agree, then, that -- cr your

13 observation is that Cort against Ash did cut back
14 substantially on Rigsby?
15

mr.

SULLIVAN;

I don't think there is any question

16 about that, Nr. Justice White.
17

What I think should also be said about the cases

18 that were decided on which we relied prior to 1974 is that
19 not only were they unanimous, not only were they before
20 Congress , Congress was clearly aware that this was what the
21 state of the law was -22

QUESTION;

How many are there, Nr. Sullivan?

23

NR. SULLIVAN;

I think it depends on who is doing

24 the counting, as to how many.

There, I think, are about ten

25 or eleven that either hold it or say it indicta with respect

the Act.

Some are 4b cases and

2 some are manipulation cases.
J

3

QUESTION*

4

KR. SULLIVAN *

How many are Supreme Court cases?
Well, there is one Supreme Court

5 case, the Deaktor case, in which the Court held that in the
6 first instance a manipulation claim

should be presented to

7 the agency, and while the Court didn't squarely hold in that
8 case,

and we certainly concede that it didn't, that there

9 was a private remedy under the manipulation section.
10 Certainly the implication of the Court's decision
11 go in

that you

the first instance to the agency or to the old

12 commission certainly implies that in the second

instance you

13 can go to court, and indeed, the exchanges did net contest
14 that in that case.

They simply argued the case, and it was

15 argued here as a prime jurisdiction question, which again
16 shows how well settled in our view the law was at. that time.
17

And along that line, in fact, in

1974, when the

18 exchanges, in an attempt to cut back on their liability,
19 went to Congress and in effect conceded that as the law
20 stood

then they could be liable under the manipulation

21 provisions,

and that they needed relief, and Congress --

22 there is no evidence that Congress gave them any relief.

23

In years later, in testimony before the

24 Commission, as we point out, the commodity professionals,
25 the industry also treated this as a question that had been

The

7 jurisdiction, and presumably if you agree that there was a

10

QUESTION;

Mr. Sullivan, may I ask you a question

11 or two that I would ask the Solicitor General if he were
12 here?

It may not be fair to ask you, but it is a bit

13 curious, at least for me, that the executive branch of
14 government, the Solicitor General's office in particular,
15 should be here today when there is no guestion of the
16 constitutionality of a statute, arguing in favor of an
17 implied cause of action, in view of the fact that there are
18 scores of cases that have fallen into the federal judicial
19 system trying to decide just what we are trying to decide
20 here today, whether Congress intended to create a cause of
21 action when it didn't utter a sinqle word in the statute
22 that supports -that, and it seems to me to be a curious thing
23 for the government of the United States, the executive
24 branch to be arguing that the courts rather than the
25 legislative branch should decide this issue.
