ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES H. PIPKIN, JR., ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. PIPKIN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

9 may it please the Court:
I represent petitioner, Southern Pacific

10

11

Transportation Company, a railroad common carrier

12 involved in

this action.

In essence, the action is an

13 effort by the carrier to recover from the shipper or
14 consignor -- in this case, respondent Commercial Metals
15 Company — freight charges incurred in transporting
16 three separate carload shipments of steel cobble, which
17 is a form of scrap steel, from Detroit, Michigan to
18 southern California back in 1974.

The dollar amount

19 involved in these movements is small; it is less than
20 $14,000

total.

21

The legal issue presented is of great

22 significance to the nation’s railroads and motor

23 carriers.

It is whether a carrier’s right to recover

24 transportation charges from a consignor can be barred by
25 an implied remedy based on a violation of the ICC's

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

credit regulations

Or putting it another way, it is

2 whether an equitable defense should be added to the

3 credit regulations as an enforcement mechanism.
4

The courts below found that the carrier

5 violated the ICC’s credit regulations with respect to
6 all

three shipments here involved, by delivering the

7 first shipment without checking the credit worthiness of
8 the consignee and by accepting checks which

were later

9 returned for insufficient funds, and one of which was
10 for an amount less than that subsequently determined
11

12

to

be due.
Though Southern Pacific contends that the

13 actions with respect to the second and third cars do not
14 violate the credit regulations, we concede a violation
15 with respect to the first.

So the question is what

16 consequences arise from that violation.

And the courts

17 below found that while Southern Pacific had made a prima
18 facie case of a right to recovery from the consignor,
19 the credit violation gave rise to an affirmative defense
20 which barred collection of the charges.
21

The argument I would like to make this morning

22 is basically twofold.

It is first, that the lower

23 court’s decision is inconsitent with the purposes of the
24 credit regulations as well as their language and history
25 and 50 years of case law; and second, that the decision,

4

if allowed to stand, will have serious adverse

QUESTION;

system.

Before you get into your argument,

4

may I ask you a question about the facts, Hr. Pipkin.

5

Does the record tell us whether the consignor was paid

6 for

the goods?
KB. PIPKIN:

7

I am not sure that it is in the

8 record, but it is conceded
9

merits that he was paid.

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. PIPKIN:

Oh, it is.

12 that the court below
13

in respondent's brief on the

I missed it.

Thank you.

One of our reasons for saying
erred is based on the contract

between the carrier and the consignor.
QUESTION:

14

Mr. Pipkin, let me interrupt you a

15

little bit.

What is the percentage of consignors that

16

sign that annotation?

17

MR. PIPKIN:

There is no information that is

18

available that really would give an overall percentage

19

of that.

I understand in the case of Southern Pacific

20 it is something like one-third.
21

QUESTION:

I couldn't hear Justice Stevens’s

22 question and I may be repeating,

but what is the status

23

-- does the record show the status of the Southern

24

Pacific's suit against Carco?

25

MR. PIPKIN:

The record doesn't show the

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sta tus

It shows that the summons and the complaint

2 were unable to be served, both by special processor who
3

were hired by the carrier, and subsequently by the

4

Marshall's office of the court.

5

made, and in fact, the record shows that the carrier was

6 unable even
7

to track down the consignee through the

Secretary of State’s office of the state of California.

8 So all that
9

the record really shows is that service was

unable to be obtained, and that the consignee

10 effectively

vanished.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. PIPKIN:

13

No service was ever

Were the goods ever paid for?
Yes, sir.

That was the answer to

Mr. Justice Stevens' question.
The consignor is the party that requests the

14
15

transportation service and selects the consignee.

16

the consignor fills out a bill of lading, which is the

17

basic contract between the consignor and the carrier.

18

Its terms are described by the Interstate Commerce

19

Commission, and unless the bill of lading explicitly

20 provides
21

22

And

to the contrary, the consignor is presumed to

be primarily liable for the freight charges.
The consignor has the option, however, of

23

disclaiming liability for the charges by executing the

24

so-called "non-recourse clause” that appears on the face

25

of the bill of lading.

If the consignor fails to sign

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the non-recourse clause, it becomes primarily liable for

2 the freight charge,

and the carrier knows that if he is

3 unable to collect from the consignee, he can then turn
4 to the consignor for payment.
5

QUESTION':

What is the practical effect of the

6 non-recourse clause?

What incentive does the consignor

7 have not to sign it?
8

ME. PIPKIN:

Well, that involves the business

9 relationships essentially between the consignor and the
10 consignee.

Any consignee would rather receive goods on

11

credit, and most goods do move on credit.

Approximately

12

95% of the goods in interstate freight transportation

13 move on credit.
14

If the c onsignor signs t he non-recourse clause

15 which says that he is not liable f or payment, the
16 carrier is then mo re likely to del iver that shipment to
17 the consignee on a COD basis, unle ss he knows the
18 consignee well and has dealt with him in the past.

The

19 consignee clearly would rather not have that situation
20 arise,

and if he h as two prospecti ve sellers of goods,

21 one of which will not sign the non -recourse clause and

22 one which does, he would rather ge t the goods from the

23 consignor so it wi 11 arrive on a c redit basis rather
24 than COP.

But tha t is really a bu siness judgment and it

25 involves, to some extent, almost w hether it is deemed

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

insulting to the consignee to receive it on that basis.

2

But in any event, the continuing liability of

3 the consignor who does not sign the non-recourse clause
4 is clear from the language of the bill of lading and
5 clear under the case law for the last 60 years, and in
6

fact, as this Court has expressly recognized that in the

7 Illinois Steel case cited in our briefs.
The cases also indicate that under the

8

9 Interstate Commerce Act, the carrier has a duty to
10 collect the

freight charge, and if he cannot collect it

11

from the consignee, he must try to collect it from the

12

consignor.

Allowing a violation of the credit

13 regulations to be used as a bar against collection from
14 the consignor would be inconsistent with those cases and
15 the essential purposes that they endorse.
16

Apart from the contract, the principal reason

17 for our position basically is the statute and the
18 regulations are part of a comprehensive regulatory
19 scheme, and they are totally silent on any affirmative
20 defense arising from violation of the credit
21

regulations.

And I would like to speak just for a

22 second about the history.

23

The credit regulations can be traced back to

24 1918 during the first World War when the Director
25 General of the railroads then issued something called

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

General Order Number 25, which essentially put

2 interstate freight transportation on a cash basis, with
3

a few exceptions.

4
5

The purposes are undisputed for taking that
action.

They were to increase the working capital of

6 the carriers by reducing the amount of freight charges
7

that would be outstanding, owed by the consignees, and

8 to reduce discrimination.
9

And when in 1920 the Congress

enacted what became Section 3(2) of the Interstate

10

Commerce Act, the issue here involved — that is the

11

basis for the credit regulations.
The continued that same policy.

12

Carriers were

13

told that they could not deliver freight until the

14

charges were paid, except under such rules and

15

regulations as the commission should prescribe.

16

same purposes were true, though -- to protect the

17

carriers and their working capital, and to prevent

18

discrimination.

19

20

carriers.

And in this whole

8

And that engrafting such a defense on the

regulatory scheme would in no way further the purposes

9 of that scheme, which were to protect the carrier’s
10

working capital and to prevent discrimination.

11

In addition, the ICC has taken a very clear

12 position on this same issue that is before the Court.

13 It has expressly said in the CGF Grain case that we cite
14 in our briefs that a credit regulation — credit
15 violation, excuse me — has no effect on a consignor's
16 liability.
17

MR. PIPKIN:

Yes, Your Honor.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, we recognize that there are cases cited

2 by Commercial Metals in this case, virtually all of
3

which involve a situation where there is a consignee who

4

has had some misrepresentation made to him by a carrier,

5

and the result is that the consignee has relied on that

6 misrepresentation and taken some detrimental action; and
7

where the court has found that if payment were to be

8 required, the consignee would have effectively paid
9

twice.

And the courts in those — or, a number of the

10

courts addressing those cases have held that there can

11

be an estoppal in that situation.

12

What I would point out is that whatever the

13

merits of those decisions, those cases do not turn on a

14

violation of the credit regulations but rather on a

15

misrepresentation by the carrier in detrimental

16

reliance.

17

1

regulations have been interpreted consistently from the

2 time of their promulgation through the next 50 years,
3

this Court should not, in the 1980's, engraft a new

4

affirmative defense upon them.

5

The other reasons that we give for reaching

6 that conclusion have to do with the consequences of the
7

lower court's decision.

If the decision is upheld, one

8 result, simple result, is the practical elimination of
9

the non-recourse clause which has been in the bill of

10

lading for 61 years and which obviously has been viewed

11

as having some purpose.

12

And I say that it will be practically

13

eliminated because the credit regulations require that

14

payment be made within five days.

15

doesn’t pay it within five days, technically a credit

16

violation will have occurred.

17

then turns to the consignor, the consignor will be able

18

to say well, you violated the credit regulations by not

19

forcing payment within that five-day period, so in

20

effect, it will make no difference whether the

21

non-recourse clause is signed or not.

22

If the shipper

And whenever the carrier

23

consignors and consignees will claim that they do not

have to pay because of some credit violation.

several possible results to this, all of them we submit

2 the

First, the carriers, as the amicus brief filed by
ATA and the AEE indicate, may be forced to curtail

3 extensions of credit.

As I mentioned, 957 of freight

4 now moves on credit, and the amount of credit
5 outstanding on shipments in any year is something like
6 $25 billion.

7

If a carrier knows that the consignor will no

8 longer be liable for a charge if he is unable to collect

9 from the consignee,
10 COD in
11

the carrier will insist on payment

a much higher percentage of the cases.

This has

a serious effect on the credit relationships; it also

12 will impair

efficient rail operations because it will

13 result in cars having to sit there for a longer period
14 of time until cash can be obtained from the consignee.
15

And in addition, we suggest that the Court

16 should not overlook the increased litigation that
17 inevitably will occur in order to ascertain liability
18 for freight charges.

The decision below will be read as

19 saying that every violation of the credit regulations
20

gives rise to an affirmative defense.

21 highly unfair,

That would be

and even Commercial Metals does not go

22 that far.

23

When the ICC has reviewed the operation of the

24 credit regulations from time to time, they have found
25 that many violations occur, many violations are

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

unavoidable, and that the majority of those violations

2 are actually caused by shippers rather than carriers.
3

And that is because of this situation where the ICC's

4

jurisdiction is over the carriers.

5

worded that payment must be recieved within five days,

6

if it is properly extended in the first place.

7

the carrier often doesn’t have any control over whether

8

that payment can be enforced or not from the consignee.

9

So it clearly would be unfair to say that there is any

10
11

The regulations are

Well,

kind of an estoppal situation in all cases.
So what Commercial Metals has done in this

12

case is take the position that there is a fault standard

13

which should be read into this.

14

saying that there should be an estoppal only when the

15

violation is the carrier’s fault.

16

They are basically

But I suggest that that is part of a standard

17

that raises many hard issues.

First of all, what is

18

meant by fault.

19

carrier have to take some action intentionally in order

20

to violate the regulations or create some

21

discrimination?

Is negligence enough, or does the

The regulations say, moreover, that

22 before extending credit, a carrier must take whatever
23

precautions it deems appropriate, so it leaves it

24

essentially up to the carrier what precautions to take.

25

Well, if fault becomes the test, will there be

15

QUESTION;

Yes, but you are suggesting that to

7 any investigation.
8

SR. PIPKIN;

I am suggesting that this Court

9 should adopt a blanket rule saying that in the case of
10 consignors who have the opportunity to protect
11 themselves by signing the non-recourse clause, there
12 should be no —
13

QUESTION;

Well, you are suggesting that we

14 construe the statute that way.
15

MR. PIPKIN;

16

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
And you say that the regulation

17 construes it that way.
18

MR. PIPKIN;

That is the way it has been up

19 until now.
20

QUESTION;

And so it wouldn’t make any

21 difference if the agent or the railroad deliberately
22 didn't make an investigation.
23

MR. PIPKIN;

It is our position that there

24 should be a blanket rule, but let me say further on that
25 — we concede that there is a violation in this case.

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

We don’t concede that there is any connection between

2 that violation and the loss that occurred, which is
3

something we think the courts below slurred over very

4

quickly.

5

6

QUESTION:

It wouldn’t make any difference if

there was, would there?

7

MR. PIPKIN:

In our view, it should not.

But

8

on that first shipment, there was no credit check.

But

9

the carrier in that case could have, as it did in the

10

case of the second and third shipments, required a

11

check.

So we don’t think there is a causal

So in addition to determining the tricky

19

question of whether a violation has occurred, the

20

courts, if the rule advanced by Commercial Metals were

21

to prevail, would also have to grapple with this vague

22 fault standard, applying it in particular factual
23

would be no assistance from the agency that is charged

And

not only increased litigation, but inconsistent results,

inconsistent results will probably prevail.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Pipkin, may I ask another

question, just looking at the CFG case that you rely

13 heavily on.

That appears to be an under-charge case

14 rather than a non-payment case, isn't it?

And would

15 that necessarily then have the same rule as one
16 involving -- whether a credit violation excuses payment
17 of the full charge.

I am not saying that you are

18 necessarily wrong, but I am just not sure that I
19 understand why that case -20

MB. PIPKIN*

We don't deny that the statement

in that case is essentially a dictive, that it is a

22 statement of the agency's position which is broad and

But in the face of a lack of

support, as a legal matter, for the proposition advanced

policy justification in terms of the effective

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID M. SUDBURY, ESQ.

24

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MR. SUDBURY;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

2

The Southern Pacific, having admittedly

3

engaged in illegal, negligent and inequitable conduct

4

today comes before this Court seeking to transfer the

5

very fruit of that action to an innocent consignor.

The

6 Interstate Commerce Commission Act, specifically,
7

Section 3.2 entitled Payment of Freight as a

8 Prerequisite to Delivery, prohibits a railroad from
9

delivering any freight shipped by it until all charges

10

have been paid, except under express circumstances

11

promulgated by the rules and regulations of the

12

Interstate Commerce Commission.
The applicable regulations which counsel has

13
14

conceded have been violated, at least with regard to the

15

first shipment are located in 49 CFR 1320.1, and they

16

provide that a railroady may extend, only for a very

17

limited number of days, credit under certain

18

circumstances, provided that it takes precautions to

19

ensure timely payment of charges.

KR. SUDBURY;

the railroad, in this case, to take any precaution with

1

admittely, the consignee was not a credit patron of

2

the railroad, had never applied for credit and had never

3 been given credit.

The decision to extend credit to the

4 consignee was a pure act of voluntarism on the part of
5 the railroad.
6

QUESTION:

But supposing they had checked it

7 out and said we find you are a bad credit risk; we are

And they called your

9 client up and said what do you want us to do?

What

10 would you have said?

MR. SUDBURY:

11

At that point in time, Your

12 Honor, our worst expectations would have been to have

13 had possession -- or at least, to have control cf the
14 material that was in a yard in California, had not been
15 released to the consignee.

Once it went to the

16 consignee, the party that had written hot checks here

Your Honor, we would --

QUESTION:

And you would have had the goods

23 back, but instead of the goods you have got payment for
24 the goods.

So how does it -- I don’t understand how you

25 are that badly hurt.

MR. SUDBURY;

QUESTION;

But you were paid.

MR. SUDBURY;

The sale was made fob Detroit.

5 What we received was the fob purchase price, free
6 onboard

the rail carrier in Detroit.

We were not paid

7 in this case for the freight charges to California.
8 That is why the bill of lading was,

as the railroad has

9 admitted, freight collect.
QUESTION;

10
11

I understand that, but I still

don’t quite understand how you are hurt because had you

12 been advised of the situation, you could have gotten the

13 goods back., but you still would have had to pay the
14 freight.

I don’t know how much these goods are worth, I

15 don't have any idea, but I wonder if you would have been

I think that is in the record in the

The railroad

It was strictly in the railroad ' s

dominion to determine whether they were goi ng to release

the goods, and when they did so, in fact, t hey didn't

find I think even more specifically, to answer

13

your question, I want to call the Court's attention to

14

the facts involved in the dates of these shipments.

15

first shipment left Detroit on April 11, 1974.

16

shipment arrived and was released, admittedly without

17

any credit check, to the consignee on April 25, 1374.

they didn't leave Detroit until Kay 2nd, sometime after

That

20 the consignee had the first car already in his
21

22

possession.
Specifically to answer your question, we

23

certainly would not have shipped the second two if we

24

knew there was any problem with the first.

25

QUESTION:

And does the record tell us when

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

you were paid?

2

MR. SUDBURY;

3

QUESTION;

4

NR. SUDBURY;

5

6

By the consignee?

Yes.
The payment for the goods was

made prior to shipment.
QUESTION;

Counsel, the stipulation of facts

7

really don't refer to what an acceptable credit inquiry

8

by the carrier would have disclosed.

9

seem to me that the record might have indicated whether

And it just would

10

the information, if disclosed, would have been

11

acceptable by industry standards.

There just isn't

12 anything here, is there?
13

MR. SUDBURY;

There is nothing, Your Honor,

14

because, of course, there was no credit inquiry made.

15

The stipulation says that Carco had never even applied

16

for credit.

17

QUESTION;

And the stipulation does not appear

18

to cover the further inquiry of what it would have

19

disclosed had an inquiry been made.

20
21

MR. SUDBURY;

It does not.

The facts are that

the consignee never paid for the first shipment, and the

22 fact is that the rail — the freight charge was some two
23

weeks past due when the second cars arrived, and the

24

fact is that the railroad released the second two cars;

25

one by an extension of further credit when they took a

25

check for less thin the full amount of the freight

2 charge,

and both those checks were shortly returned by

3 the consignee’s bank marked insufficient funds.

From

4 there, the railroad was not able to find the consignee.
5

QUESTION;

What evidence do you have, counsel,

6 that the legislative body,

the Congress, was concerned

7 about protection of the consignee, the shipper, in
8 enacting Section

3.2.

The evidence that we have

9 examined would indicate that the concern of Congress was
10 with

the protection of the carriers, not the shipper.

11

MS. SUDBURY;

12 forth in the preamble,

The purpose of the Act, as set
is to promote the orderly and

13 efficient transportation policy throughout the United
14 States.

Specifically, it refers to encouraging sound

15 economic conditions in transportation throughout the
16 United States.
17

Certainly, —

18

QUESTION;

That is just the preamble to the

19 Transportation Act of 1920, isn't it, which had a lot of
20 provisions in it.
21

MR. SUDBURY;

That is correct.

22 position that the shipper,

The railroad's

or that the consignor in this

23 case, is not protected by any legislative history simply
24 defies the realities of the transportation shipment.
25 The fact is that the railroad released these goods,

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

extended the credit on its own volition.

They

2 improperly and in violation of not only the regulations

3 but the law — the law says in Section 3.2 that no
4 carrier by railroad and no express company subject to
5 the provisions of this chapter shall deliver or
6 relinquish

possession at destination of any freight

7 transported by it until all tariff charges have been
8 paid, except under such conditions as the Interstate

9 Commerce Commission may from time to time prescribe.
10
11

QUESTION*

That is true, but do you have

anything in the legislative history that indicates that

12 that provision

was enacted for the benefit of the

13 shipper ?
14

XR. SUDBURY*

Under the railroad's argument.

15 Justice O'Connor, the legislative history was directed
16 solely toward increasing the cash flow of the railroad.
17 Certainly, the extension of credit on their part here
18 was an act which they voluntarily undertook that hurt or
19 certainly handicapped that cash flow in this case.
20

QUESTION*

Mr. Sudbury, I take it that in

21 light of this discussion you have just been having with
22 Justice O’Connor,

that you agree that this case is to be

23 decided in light of the Act and the regulations; this is
24 not a common law suit.
25

MR. SUDBURY*

No, to the contrary, Your

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Honor.

The Act specifically states that — in its

to eliminate any remedies that were available at the

QUESTION;

Even inspite of the failure to sign

9 the non-recourse clause?
10
11

MR. SUDBURY;

That is correct. Your Honor.

The non-recourse clause is a means by which a consignor

12 can relieve itself absolutely of any liability, as a

That is really the

Our position is that the option to sign the
non-recourse part of Section 7 is just that; it is a

20 contract option.
21

The failure to sign it does not

It doesn't preclude any other remedies

The simple fact in this case is that had the

the railroad must take precautions at least to

to assure itself of timely payment of the

SR. SUDBURY;

My understanding is that at

25 option on it.

The commission has promulgated a

QUESTION;

And the form promulgated by ICC

KR. SUDBURY:

19 rail carrier or a consignor insist on its deletion

Yes.

19

MR. SUDBURY:

Absolutely not.

20 as it has been referred to, our
21

Our standard,

test that it would seem

logical to apply is that you must have equity on your

22 side.

Certainly a consignee who received the goods who

23

had not paid the charges is not going to be heard to

24

complain that it is not required to pay because the

25

railroad never investigated its credit worthiness.

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

So it is not enough just to have a

2 bare violation of the statute and regulation.
3

MB. SUDBURY;

That is correct, Your Honor, and

4 we have never suggested that.

In fact, as the railroad

5 has pointed out, the large majority of the violations of.
6 the regulations are required where the consignee
7 receives freight and does not make payment within a
8 certain
9

period of time.
QUESTION;

Of course, in one sense, your

10

client, the consignor, selected the consignee, and your

11

argument imposes this pre-selected consignee on the

12

carrier, doesn't it?

13
14

MR. SUDBURY:

We selected to do business with

this person on an fob Detroit basis, that is correct,

15 Your Honor.

We did not instruct the railroad — in

16 fact, to the contrary, under the law and regulations, we
17 expected that they would either collect the charges at
18 the

time of delivery or shortly thereafter, certainly

19 within a matter of days.

Again, we were not even

20 notified of this loss for over 31 months.
21

As I pointed out, the railroad mailed its bill

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Suppose the railroad had said to the consignee, cash on

2 the line or no delivery.

Then they would have to -- I

3 don't know whether this would have involved a lot of
4 demurrage, but at any rate, they would have had to, in
5 effect, impound the entire shipment, wouldn't they,
6 until paid?

KR. SUDBURY:

QUESTION:

NR. SUDBURY:

10

QUESTION:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Now, who then would be liable?
For the demurrage?

For the demurrage and the freight

11 charges .
12

NR. SUDBURY:

The courts have held that lawful

13 charges include not only the freight charges but also
14 the demurrge, and not signing Section 7, had the
15 consignee just refused the shipment for some reason,
16 gone out of business before it got there, we would have
17 been liable, the consignor would have been liable for
18 the freight, as well as the demurrage charges.

What we were

to assume was the total lack of any credit

QUESTION;

In what respects are you worse off

as a result of the delivery?

5

MR. SUDBURY;

We have no -- obviously no

6

ability to go back against the consignee, at least based

7

on the record that the railroad has in trying to locate

8 him.
9

We have had no more success.

The counsel for the

railroad suggested that an agent may have released this

MR. SUDBURY:

17

As I was saying, the railroad mailed its bill

18 for the first carloads on April 25, 1974.

Giving the

19 railroad the benefit of the most liberal interpretation
20 of

the regulations dealing with when it was due, the

21 first bill

was already two weeks' past due when the

22 second cars arrived

and were released by the railroad.

23 Obviously, the last two cars were released when the bill
24 was blatantly delinquent.
25

The counsel for the railroad has pointed out

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the railroad accepted two checks for the last two

2 cars, one of

which is inexplicably in an am ount

3 approximately $900 short of the proper amou nt.

Their

4 brief refers to some transposition of numbe rs, but
5 still , that amounted to an extension of ere dit on the
6 part of the railroad.

7

They have also asked how acceptin g a check for

or two checkes for the last t wo cars,

parties.

As the railroad has admitted and the case law

2 is clear,

the bill of lading is a common law contract.

3

This contract expressly provides that the service of a

4

carrier is to be performed in accordance with the

5

conditions listed on the back of the contract terms and

6 conditions,
7

unfortunately poorly reproduced in the Joint Appendix,

8 Section

on the back of that document, which is

7.

It is at pages 37 and 41, although

eligible.

I would refer you to page 1(a) of the

10 appendix to

the brief of the National Industrial Traffic

11 League which has the entire document.
12

It reads that the owner of the consignee shall

13

pay the freight and average, if any, and all other

14

lawful charges accruing on said property.

15

those instances where it may lawfully be authorized to

But except in

16 do so, no carrier by railroad shall deliver or

They did not get to -- or

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

mistakenly portrays the Interstate Commerce Commission’s

2 view of its role in determining

the liability of

3 consignors and consignees under bills of lading.
4 Specifically, at footnote 1, page 2 of the Southern
5 Pacific’s reply brief on the merits, it implies that the
6 Interstate

Commerce Commission has expanded its

7 jurisdiction to include interpretation of the liability
8 of

parties to a bill of lading contract.

9

In fact, the Interstate Commerce Commission in

10

the CGF Grain case, as was mentioned earlier,

11

specifically has reiterated what it classifies as its

12 longstanding position that the question

of a contract is

13 to be resolved -- or the question of liability under a
14 contract -- is to be resolved by the courts.

The

15 Commission said that the question of complainant’s
16 liability does not turn on whether any provision of the
17 Act has been violated, but rather is governed by the
18 bill of lading contract between the parties, and it must
19 be decided by interpreting that contract.
20
21 determined

For this reason, it is a question to be
by the courts and not this Commission.

This

22 conclusion is in accordance with numerous past cases in

23 which the Commission has declined to decide questions of
24 liability as between a consignor and a consignee.
25

In reply to the -- this position, the railroad

has once again in its reply brief looked to a purported

2 historical analysis to attempt to portray the first

3 sentence of Section 7 as actually two clauses somehow
4 combined in history into a single sentence.

The fact is

5 that those two clauses do relate to the consignee.
6 the bill of

When

lading is executed, the consignee is not

7 even a party to the contract; the law is he only becomes
8

a party to it when he accepts the goods upon delivery.

9

Such a convoluted analysis as called for or

10 reguested
11

by the railroad is not required.

The contract

obligation is clear, and that obligation was breached,

12 in

addition to the violation of the Act.

13

The Fifth Circuit held that the Southern

14 Pacific, although establishing a prima facie case of
15 primary liability on the part of Commercial Metals,
16 nevertheless permitted Commercial Metals to raise an
17 equitable defense based on the facts.

The Atcon case referred to by

counsel for the railroad is a case exactly on point,

17

although that case doesn’t even -- the facts in that

18

case don’t reveal whether or not there was an initial

19

violation of the law and regulations based on the

20 unbridled extension of credit to the consignee in that
21

case.

All it says is that the carrier’s failure to come

22 back against the consignor within the time period set
23

forth in the regulations is a violation of the credit

24

restrictions, and therefore, a defense can be raised.

25

QUESTION:

Which case was that, again?
