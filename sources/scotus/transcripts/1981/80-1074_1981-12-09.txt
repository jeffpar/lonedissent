ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7
8

MR. GELLER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

9 please the Court, this is a constitutional damages action,
10 so-called Bivens action against former Attorney General
11

Edward Levi, former head of the Law Enforcement Assistance

12 Administration,

Richard Velde, and two former subordinate

13 LEAA officials, Charles Work and Herbert Rice.
14

The plaintiffs are six blacks and six women, and

15 an organization that represents black police officers.
16 Plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in September,

1975, claiming

17 that a number of police organizations that received LEAA
18 monetary grants were engaging in race and sex discrimination
19 in employment.

Plaintiffs allege that the defendants’

20 failure to institute administrative proceedings under the
21

LEAA statute to cut off federal funds to these organizations

22 violated their rights under

the due process clause of the

23 Fifth Amendment.
24

For this alleged constitutional violation,

25 Plaintiffs demanded that the four defendants pay them $20

the other defendants were not

to absolute immunity here, because under the LEAA
as the court read it they had virtually no

15 discretion

in deciding whether to terminate LEAA funding to

16 recipients who

were alleged to have engaged in

17 discrimination.

Now, the Department of Justice has brought this

18
19 case

to this Court because we believe that the court of

20 appeals decision seriously misconstrues governing legal
21 principles not only

of absolute immunity for federal

22 officials but also of what governmental action constitutes

QUESTION;

Hr. Geller, are you also going to

1 address the Simon versus Eastern Kentucky standing problem?
2

MR. GELLER;

We have not raised standing as a

3 separate issue in this case, although we do think that the
4 failure of these plaintiffs to show how the defendant's
5 actions violated their constitutional rights shows that the
6 complaint in this case does not allege violation of the due
7 process clause, and we have raised that question.

We have

8 raised as our second question the failure of the complaint
9 to state a claim.
10

QUESTION;

Well, but standing is an Article 3

11 requirement in many cases, is it not?
12

MR. GELLER;

13

QUESTION;

Yes, yes, it is.
A jurisdictional thing which both

14 counsel and the court are obliged to notice -15
16 brief,

MR. GELLER;

Yes.

We have discussed Simon in our

in the section of the brief that is devoted to

17 showing why the complaint does not state a cause of action.
18

QUESTION;

All three judges below felt there was

19 sufficient standing here on the motion to dismiss,
20

MR. GELLER;

I take it.

Well, we said that, I think, in our

21 petition, but on further reading of the case, I am not sure
22 that is correct.

I think that Judge Tam did not find there

23 was standing as to the claim that the plaintiffs now tell
24 this Court they are raising.

I think Judge Tam misconstrued

25 plaintiffs' complaint as alleging that they were harmed by

5

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the actions of the grantees# and what Judge Tam said was,
2 well, he thinks under cases like Simon versus Eastern
\

3 Kentucky the plaintiffs are at least entitled to a trial to
4 show that if the federal government had not terminated --

5 had terminated funding, it would have had some effect on the
6 actions of the grantees -7

QUESTION;

So you are -- off the statement in your

8 brief then.
9

MR. GELLER;

Yes, but as I reread the court of

10 appeals opinion just the other day, it seems quite clear
11 that Judge Tam is saying that as to the claimant, the
12 plaintiffs now tell the court they are raising, which has
13 nothing at all to do with the discrimination allegedly

y
14 practiced by the grantees, but only focuses on the federal
15 government's failure to enforce the laws, he says that is
16 essentially a citizen standing suit, and he does not agree

17 that these plaintiffs have standing.
18

I was explaining to the Court why the federal

19 government thinks this case is so important.
20

QUESTION;

Well, do you agree with him or not?

21

MR. GELLER;

We think that the case should be

22 analyzed in terms of whether the complaint states a cause of
23 action under the Fifth Amendment.

We think that is the

24 proper analysis, if the Court decides that the conduct -25

HR. GELLER;

And hence no standing, because the

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 actions of these defendants did not cause any harm to these
2 plaintiffs -3

QUESTION:

No injury in fact.

4

MR. GELLERi

Right.

Now, we have presented three

5 independent reasons why the decision below is wrong.

First,

6 we claim the defendants are entitled to the absolute
7 immunity recognized in Butz versus Economou for
8 administrative prosecutors.

Second, as I just explained, we

9 contend that the complaint in this case fails to state a
10 cause of action against these defendants under the due

11 process clause, the Fifth Amendment.
12

Finally, even if the complaint could be construed

13 to state a due process claim, because the defendants acted
14 in good faith and had no reason to know that their actions
15 were unconstitutional, they are entitled to qualified
16 immunity as a matter of law and should not be forced to
17 undergo a trial.
18

The principal issue in this case is one of

19 official immunity.

In Butz against Economou, this Court

20 held that government officials who must decide whether or
21 when to initiate administrative proceedings play a role
22 similar to that of a prosecutor who must decide whether or
23 not to press criminal charges.

For this reason, the Court

24 held that administrative officials, like a prosecutor, are
25 entitled to absolute immunity from personal damages claims,

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

even when constitutional claims are involved.
This immunity, the court said, is essential to

2

3 ensure that

agency officials may exercise their discretion

5 government against

6 of the law,

some respondent for an alleged violation

should be made free from the intimidation that

7 is inevitably associated with
8 damages

liability in the event that someone is unhappy with

9 that decision to charge or

not to charge.

There is no question here that the defendants

10
11

the possibility of personal

collectively were charged with the responsibility for

12 enforcing the LEAA

statute, including the

13 anti-discrimination
14 allegation
15 to decide

provisions, and that when faced with an

of discrimination by a fund recipient, they had
whether or not to start administrative proceedings

16 to cut off

further federal funding.

Defendants had to

17 decide

whether a charge of discrimination was likely to have

18 merit,

whether the discrimination alleged was sufficiently

19 substantial

to warrant the expenditure of LEAA's scarce

20 investigative and
21

prosecutorial resources,

whether the

ultimate sanction of partial or complete fund termination

22 was the best way of

achieving the goal of ending

23 discrimination .
24

We submit that these are precisely the sort of

25 decisions this

Court had in mind in Economou when it

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

referred to agency officials performing functions analogous

2 to

that of a prosecutor.
Now, the only reason that the D. C. circuit

3
4 offered

for refusing to accord the defendants absolute

5 immunity was

that the defendants in the court's view had

6 virtually no discretion under the LEAA
7 whether

statute in deciding

to institute fund termination proceedings.

this would be the case regardless of how many

15 complaints were filed,

and regardless of how scarce the

16 prosecutor's resources were.

QUESTION;

You don’t reach Bivens, you don’t reach

3 any other questions.
4

MB. GELLER:

5

QUESTION;

That's correct.
And you wouldn’t reach Bivens if you

6 said there wasn’t a private cause of action at all.

You

7 wouldn’t reach the issue of whether there is a violation of
8 the Constitution.
9

MR. GELLER;

I think, though, that in light of

10 this Court's decision in cases like Carlson against Green,
11

Davis against Passman, it is a more difficult analysis.

We

12 think the easier question in this case is that there is
13
14
15

simply no constitutional violation at all.
Now, as I was saying, the only reason that the
D. C. circuit found that these defendants were not entitled

16 to absolute immunity is because, as the court read the
17

statute, there was absolutely no discretion involved.

We

18

think that -- you know, Judge Tam dissented on this point,

19

and we think his dissent is clearly correct.

Under Section

20 518(c)(2) of the LEAA statute, defendants had to make an
21

initial determination whether a recipient of federal funds

22 "failed to comply with the non-discrimination provisions of
23

the LEAA statute and regulations."

This often involved

24

difficult questions of law and allocation of LEAA resources,

25

and if the defendants did decide to investigate a complaint

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and found evidence of discrimination, then under the statute

2 they had to notify the grantee state’s governor and had to
3 decide whether

the grantee "within a reasonable time" had

4 taken appropriate steps to comply with the statute
5 voluntarily.

QUESTION;

Where are you reading from?

4

MR. GELLER :

I am reading from the joint appendix

5 where the complaint is reprinted, starting on Page 13.

The

6 only allegation of the defendant's conduct that is alleged
7 to have violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights in
8 this complaint is the failure to terminate federal funding.
9 On Page 13, under the nature of the claim, the complaint
10 says, plaintiffs allege that the defendants have awarded
11 excess of a certain figure in dollars to law enforcement
12 agencies, federal funding which has been used to
13 discriminate on grounds of race and sex.

That is the only

14 allegation of harm.
15

And then, on Pages --

16

QUESTION;

How about all those statements on Page

17 20, and so forth?
18

MR. GELLER:

19

QUESTION:

Well, on Pages -Like a policy of not conducting any

20 pre-award compliance -MR. GELLER:

21

I understand

that there are a lot of

22 allegations in the complaint about what collectively the
23 defendants

did, but I am trying to focus on what the

24 plaintiffs have described
25 on

as their constitutional harm,

Pages 14 and 15 of the complaint, where each of the

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

and

1

plaintiffs is identified, and each of the plaintiffs

2 specifically

states how he or she was harmed, in every

3 single instance the only harm that is identified is the
4 refusal to terminate LEAA funding, and I might add that both
5 the majority and the dissent in
6 construed the complaint

the court of appeals

in that fashion.

In the appendix to the petition where the court of

7

8 appeals derision

is reprinted, the very beginning of the

9 court of appeals' opinion on Page 2A, Judge Basilon says
10 that
11

the plaintiffs allege that federal agencies and

officials unlawfully failed to terminate federal funding.

12 That is the only allegation of

what the constitutional

13 violation was here, and Judge Tam agrees with

It also said wilfull and malicious.

15

MR. GELLER :

17

MR. GELLER;

MR. GELLER;

That is what they allege, but the

action that the defendants are alleged

22 to have taken here that caused constitutional harm was the

23 failure to terminate funding, and Judge Tam on Page

24 agrees with that description, and therefore we think that
25 since that is clearly a discretionary determination under

wouldn’t that also avoid going through the prolix

I think we have to determine what
as their cause of action in order to

whether these are people who can raise that sort

17 of a cause of action against these defendants, and I think
18 that therefore it is an important point,

because the

19 plaintiffs had tried to obscure the point in their briefs
20 that

the only constitutional violation alleged in this

21 complaint is the failure to initiate fund termiation
22 proceedings.

I

10 should point out that one plaintiff in this case has already
11 established standing as a matter of the record in this
12 case.

Plaintiff Shumacher is from New Orleans.

In 1973,

13 these petitioners had found the New Orleans Police
14 Department to be discriminatory and in violation of Section
15 518(c), yet for two and a half years LEAA did nothing.
16

17

In

September of 1974 -- '75, we filed this lawsuit.
Immediately thereafter the LEAA petitioners in

18 this case sent a letter to the superintendent of police in
19 New Orleans stating -- not indicating they had just recently
20 been sued, but indicating -- stating straight out, and this
21 is in the record, that we now are going to compel you to
22 come into compliance immediately or we are going to
23 terminate your funds.

Within weeks a letter comes back from

24 the superintendent of police in New Orleans stating, we have
25 now eliminated the discriminatory practice, under duress.

QUESTION;

Well, that is fine as to New Orleans,

MR. LARSON;

Well, as this Court held only last

5 week in Watt v. Energy Action unanimously per Justice
6 O'Connor, only one plaintiff need have standing in order to
7 maintain the action

that we maintain.

8 is instructive on another matter, too.

Indeed, I mean Watt
Watt -- in Watt this

9 Court recognized that the standing argument which is being
10 raised here is based upon an improper assumption about

11 government activity, the improper assumption being that
12 local governments are going to look money in the face and

13 then walk away from it.

That is an improper assumption, and

14 indeed, as we have already demonstrated conclusively on this
15 record, with regard to Plaintiff Shumacher, the government,
16 local grantees will not walk away from that money.

They

17 will stop their discrimination.
18

QUESTION;

Well, I would agree with you that you

19 can't say that they won't, but the fact that one police
20 department has responded to the fund cutoff certainly

21 doesn't prove that every police department that would be
22 involved in this case would react the same way.
23

MR. LARSON;

I certainly think we should have an

24 opportunity on liscovery to prove that, as Judge Tam held in
25 his separate opinion in the court of appeals.

After this case was filed, as we pointed out

1976, we filed a preliminary injunction asking

7 LEAA to finally initiate fund termination proceedings
8 against

the Philadelphia police department, where LEAA two

9 years earlier had made a determination of discrimination but
10 had

done nothing.

11

In response to our motion for a preliminary

12 injunction,

a letter went out to the governor of

13 Pennsylvania to initiate indeed

the fund termination

3 standing.

Let me point out that these documents, these

4 post-filing documents with regard to Plaintiff Shumacher
5 appear in some of the attachments to the government's motion

We were not able, because we have

QUESTION;

2 pleading, please.
3

Don't lecture me on the rules of
I took those before you were born.

MR. LARSON;

Because of our two different claims

4 on standing, we believe that we are entitled to survive a
5 motion to dismiss as the court of appeals held below on
6 either theory of standing.
7

The government’s first argument in this case is an

8 argument in which they contend that all of the petitioners
9 are protected by an absolute prosecutorial immunity.

We

10 submit that this contention directly contravenes this
11 Court's decision in Butz.
12 this case.

Most important is the record in

As I pointed out at the outset, the government

13 petitioners uniformly adhered to an unlawful regulation
14 which Petitioner Velde stated in this record that that -15 that those regulations reguire LEAA to pursue court action
16 and not administrative action to resolve matters of
17 employment discrimination.
18

Indeed, that regulation and the interpretation of

19 that regulation were uniformly followed by the petitioners
20 in this case.

There never was an initiation of

21 administrative fund termination proceedings until this case
22 was filed.

After this case was filed,

the unlawful

23 regulation was ultimately repealed, and pursuant to our
24 motion for a preliminary injunction and the general
25 deterrent effect of bringing a damage action, petitioners

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 began to enforce, but prior to this, they didn't.
2

In other words, they did not have any discretion

3 that might even be described as prosecutorial discretion

4 because they had deprived themselves of that discretion to
5 go forward.

Indeed, in their affidavits, their pre-Butz

6 affidavits, the government petitioners in this case nowhere
7 described their functions as prosecutorial.

They described

8 themeslves as administrators, and they described their
9 policymaking functions.
10

Indeed, no petitioner in the affidavits any place

11 claimed responsibility for not initiating administrative
12 proceedings in this case.

Of course, to do so would have

13 been exactly what we have charged the petitioners with, and
14 that is exceeding their statutory authority under Section
15 518(c).

The legislative history, as Justice Blackmun points

16 out, is as obvious and clear as the statute itself.

The

17 statute says that whenever the administration makes the
18 determination, it shall move forward and initiate the
19 administrative proceedings.
20

That was violated here, and accordingly not only

21 did we allege that the petitioners, the government
22 petitioners had violated the Fifth Amendment, but indeed
23 they had exceeded the scope of their duty under their
24 statute.
25

There can be a

and there also is judicial review.
The government's second argument which was not

below or ruled on below is that the respondents here

39

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 do not have a Fifth Amendment cause of action.
2 Court pointed out earlier,
3 a statement

of proof.

As this

we believe that this is basically

It is a question going to proof, and

4 in this case there was no discovery,

and a proof argument

5 simply cannot be turned into a pleading argument, and our
6 pleadings are more than adequate to state a Fifth

Amendment

7 cause of action, as the government even concedes under
8 Bivens and under Davis particularly,

9

and also under Carlson.

Finally, the government argues that this case

10 could have been decided on summary judgment, and

that this

11 Court for the first time in this case should act as a trier
12 of fact and

rule on a summary judgment motion that was not

13 ruled on by either court below.

We submit that it would

14 have been wrong for the trial court to have ruled on the
15 qualified immunity issue on summary judgment had it been
16 filed in the trial court, and indeed, it would be improper

17 for this Court to address this issue for the first time here.
18

But particularly disturbing, indeed, I found

19 particularly astounding is

the government's argument that

20 the normal civil -- the rules that govern normal civil
21 litigation do not apply with equal force in Bivens actions
22 against federal officials.

Indeed, in Butz v. Economou,

23 this Court held that the standards that apply to state
24 officials apply with equal import to federal officials,

and

25 indeed in Butz this Court specifically invoked the federal

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

rules of civil procedure, holding that a good faith immunity

2 on summary judgment

is subject to a properly supported

3 motion for summary judgment.
Indeed, if there is any doubt about this issue

4

5 with regard to the application of Rule 56 standards to the
6 government,

the advisory committee notes to Rule 56

7 expressly state in the very first sentence, this rule is
8 applicable to all actions,

including those against the

9 United States, or an officer or agency thereof.
As we have pointed out quite extensively in our

10
11

brief, it would have been wrong as a matter of law for the

12 court below if it had been

asked to rule on qualified

13 immunity to have granted qualified immunity in favor of the
14 petitioners on this record.

Rule 56 was not complied with

15 by the government.
For these reasons, Your Honors, we believe that

16

17 the court of appeals decision below should be affirmed, and
18 the government's arguments in this case rejected.

We also

19 believe for the reasons that I point out that there is
20 standing in this case,
21

that indeed one plaintiff has already

conclusively demonstrated standing, and under many of this

22 Court's decisions,

including the unanimous decision last

23 week, in Watt v. Energy Action, there is standing in this
24 case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

4

MR. GELLER;

Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

Virtually all of the arguments that Mr. Larson

6

just made are addressed in our reply brief, to which I would

7

refer the Court, but there are a few things I do want to

8

stress specifically.
One, in response to Justice White's question, of

9
10

course there is APA review of these decisions, and

11

plaintiffs have brought an APA suit which is pending.

12

QUESTION;

In the district court?

13

MR. GELLER;

They brought it in the district

14

court.

It was dismissed as being moot.

15

appeals reversed, and remanded for further proceedings, and

16

those proceedings have been held in abeyance pending this

17

Court's decision.
QUESTION;

18
19

MR. GELLER;

QUESTION;

But it doesn't give jurisdiction, does

it?
MR. GELLER;

24
25

The Administrative Procedure Act was

the cause of action.

22
23

How do you get into court in such a

case?

20
21

The court of

No, jurisdiction would be under 28

USC 1331.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

Second, it is important to realize, because so

2 much focus has been on the 1973 and 1976 amendments, that
3 those were just amendments to Section 518(c)(2) of the
4 statute, which is the antidiscrimination provision.
5

But

there is a separate section which has been in the statute

6 since the very beginning, Section 509, which is the fund
7 termination provision.

Section 518(c)(2) simply says if the

8 administration mak.es a number of findings, then it should
9

10
11

look to Section 509 for fund termination.
So, it is Section 509 that arguably is in the
plaintiff’s view non-discretionary.

We would refer the

12 Court to the House report on Section 509 which is quoted at
13

Page 22 of our brief, which says that under Section 509, the

14

Attorney General may terminate or suspend payments on a

15

finding that there is a substantial failure to comply, and

16 that he has broad discretionary power over the fund
17
18
19

20

termination process.
Section 509 has not been amended at any time, and
that is the fund termination provision.
Now, third, as I understand Mr. Larson, he has

21

changed the theory of the plaintiff’s case yet again in

22

response to Justice Rehnquist's earlier questions, because

23

as I understood the theory of plaintiff's case this morning,

24

it was that it is irrelevant what the grantees would or

25

would not have done if the funding had been terminated, and

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that is found on Page 36 of their brief, when they explain

2 why cases like Simon versus Eastern Kentucky are irrelevant

3 here, but now we are told that that is their theory, and
4 that they made allegations to that effect in their complaint.
The final point T want to make is that although

5

6 there was no discovery in this case because a motion to

7 dismiss wa s quickly filed, respondents did get massive
8 discovery from

LEAA under the Freedom of Information Act

9 while this case was pending, and they submitted voluminous
10 materials in

11

response to the defendant’s summary judgment

motion.

Thank you.
