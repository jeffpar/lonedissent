CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We will hear arguments next

5 Mr. Andrews, I thik you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ARTHUR H. ANDREWS, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8

HR. ANDREWS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9 the Court*
10

The complaint that we have with the lower court

11 opinion in the Fifth Circuit is that it, that court, abandoned

12 any requirement of the commercial connection to either the
13 location of this maritime, or so-called maritime, collision
14 and the activity complained of.

Since this Court’s opinion in

15 Executive Jet v. The City of Cleveland, there has been a lot
16 of debate as to just what the Court meant in much of the dicta
17 in that decision in light of the fact that the decision was
18 limited to aircraft crashes on navigable waters.
19

I think that there is uniform agreement with the

20 scholars and courts that something beyond the locality alone
21 rule was required or ought to be required, because that
22 locality alone rule does not work so well anymore.
23

There is two fields of debate as I recognize the

24 issues, as to whether the locality should be abandoned
25 completely and that a maritime nexus alone should apply.

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I

1 think that the majority view, certainly the view that I take
2 and I believe the view taken by most scholars, is that
3 locality is still important.

But in addition to locality,

4 there ought to be something else.

That has been formulated I

5 think as the so-called locality plus rule.

The plus that I

V

6 would add to the occurrence is the plus of some commercial
7 flavor to either the location of the wrong or the activities
8 complained of.
9

The Fifth Circuit, in its early decisions following

10 Executive Jet; notably, Peytavin which involved a collision of
11 automobiles on a floating pontoon portion entrance way to the
\

12 ferry, found that there was no maritime jurisdiction in that
13 type of action, but I would suggest to you, kept a commercial
14 flavor to it.
15

QUESTION;

16 commercial flavor?
17

Hr. Andrews, what do you mean by a
Supposing this were a rented boat.

HR. ANDREWS;

Rented boats I don't think should

18 really — what are we talking about in the nature of?

Rented

19 boats would certainly — this case, what makes this case I

20 think interesting

and what makes it here is that we are

21 talking about commercial pleasure boating in the purest sense,
22 as the district court found.
23

QUESTION;

24 pleasure boating.

I'm just wondering about commercial
If you rent the boats — would that be

25 enough commercial flavor?

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. ANDREWS*

I cannot honestly tell the Court that

2 I can draw the line so fine to say that if I was paddling a
3 boat around, rented, on the Potomac River and it sunk because
4 of some defect in it, that that ought to be maritime law.

My

5 reaction is that it should not be.
6

QUESTION*

How would you help us to define — you

7 asked us to adopt the commercial flavor test, and I’m just
8 trying to get from you what is it that would give us enough
9 commercial flavor?
10

MR. ANDREWS*

The way I would approach the problem,

11 as pointed out in brief and which I believe is supported by at

12 least Benedict, I would use a twofold sort of test.

When we

13 are in the traditional blue water sea, more than a marine
14 league, away from the shore, I would use essentially a
15 locality alone test, so that the activity complained of would
16 not have to have a very strong relationship to commerce in
17 order to support maritime jurisprudence or the admiralty
18 jurisdiction of a federal court.
19

As I moved shoreward and got closer to the beach,

20 and as I moved inward, then I would require that the
21 complained of activity have some closer connection to

22 traditional notions of maritime activity or, i.e., commerce.
23 Now, the Kelly v. Smith case is one that definitely gave us
24 problems in the Fifth Circuit.

Judge Thornberry in our

25 argument there indicated that the panel decided our decision

5

&

1 would probably not decide Xelly v. Smith the way it was.

But

2 you will recall that is the case of the deer poachers who were
3 fleeing an island in the Mississippi River.

Certainly, the

4 court had a good deal of fun in writing that case.
5

One of the things that is important, too, and ought

6 not to be overlooked in Kelly is that there was simply no
7 other cause of action.

All of the state proceedings had

8 prescribed, or the statute had run, in common-law lingo.

But

9 in Kelly, the remedy, if there was to be a remedy, was to be
10 admiralty.
11

I view that Kelly v. Smith is more of an extreme

12 example of the lack of a maritime flavor to the activity.
13 look at the location.

But

We're talking about the Mississippi

14 River, and a very definite hazard can be posed to commercial
15 navigation because of the activity complained of.

We’ve got

16 the Kelly court recognizing that the pilot of the small boat
17 is the pilot that is wounded by the shot from shore, and we
18 have got activity in the Mississippi River.
19

That is why I think that Kelly ought to be the far

20 parameter —
21

QUESTIONS

Really what you are saying, I guess, is
a

22 that instead of using navigability as the test, you'd use
23 commercial navigability.

24

HR. ANDREWS:

25

QUESTION*

I would.

That is —

4

QUESTION:

Then location would be the sole test if

3 it was on water that was used for commerce.
4

HR. ANDREWS:

5 equally wrong.

6

No, sir.

I think that that would be

I think —

QUESTION:

Well, most boats have to come to shore.

7 and they come into a port through some channels.

8

HR. ANDREWS:

9

QUESTION:

That is right.

Which are used by pleasure boats and all

10 other kinds of boats.

You would say even there, that location

11 would not be the sole test.
12

HR. ANDREWS:

No.

I would say that the location

13 ought to be examined in light of its importance to commerce,

i
14 and that the activity complained of ought to also be examined
15 in light of its relationship —
16

QUESTION:

You wouldn't require some connect — so

17 no pleasure boat would ever by covered by admiralty.
18

HR. ANDREWS:

I wouldn't go so far as to say that.

19 If a pleasure boat collided —

20

QUESTION:

Well, give me an example.

21

HR.. ANDREWS:

A pleasure boat colliding with a barge

22 on this particular waterway further south, or whatever.

24

QUESTION:

If coming into a harbor you collide with

25 a commercial ship that is maritime, and if you collide with

1

another pleasure boat it is not

2
a

BE. ANDREWS*

I cannot say that either, because that

3 is the importance of the harbor.

Certainly, if this accident

4 would have occurred in the Port of New York, or in the City
5 and Port of New Orleans or Baton Rouge, I could not come to
6 this Court or any other court and say that the federal
7 interest, and the admiralty interest is not significantly
8 great enough, and that this activity is so remote from
9 commerce and legitimate admiralty ends that there should be no
10 jurisdiction.
11

I beleive I can say that where we are now, because

12 we are talking about a very insignificant inland waterway that
.
f

13 has no commercial purpose and if it is even found —
14 recognized by the Fifth Circuit — if it has any significance
15 to commercial activities, it is very minor.
16

QUESTION*

Mr. Andrews, supposing you took the

17 portion of the intercoastal waterway around the perimeter of
18 Florida, which is primarily used by large numbers of pleasure
19 boats, yachts and things like that.

Admiralty jurisdiction or

20 not when two pleasure boats bump into each other?
21

MR. ANDREWS*

Within the intercoastal waterway?

22 would say that there would probably be jurisdiction.

S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (207) 554-2345

I

1

MR. ANDREWS*

I think that the test is this, and it

2 is not just Mr. Andrews saying it.

I believe that Mr.

3 Benedict helps me, and I am glad to say that.

But, I think

4 that you have to look at the location, and its relationship to
5 commerce.
6

QUESTION*

I'm looking at the location, say, between

7 Palm Beach and Miami down there.
8

MR. ANDREWS*

9

QUESTION*

Now let's look at the activity, too.

And the location is 905? pleasure boats

10 and two pleasure boats bump into each other.
11

MR. ANDREWS*

But the location is also within —

12 well, I was under the impression that we were talking about
13 the intercoastal waterway that I am familiar with that has a
14 great deal of inland barge traffic and a great deal of inland
15 ship traffic.
16

QUESTION*

I think along the Florida one — assume

17 for my example anyway that there is a large amount of pleasure

18 boating in a waterway and maybe an occasional commercial
19 fisherman or something, and two pleasure boats collide.

20

NR. ANDREWS*

In that situation, and because we are

21 talking about close to shore, I would say probably no
22 jurisdiction.

There is no need for that jurisdiction.

23 is no need for the federal court to entertain it.
24 state action and a state remedy is available,
25 what I would turn it on.

There

There is a

but that is not

It is just simply that the need to

2 shipping — is simply not there.
k

And it ought not,to be a

3 case of — you are opening up not only a type of or class of
4 case to the jurisdiction of a court, but an entire field of
5 law that ought not to be applicable to them.
6

In Louisiana we have a great deal of small

7 commercial fishermen, small trappers, and under this decision
8 of the Fifth Circuit and where it is going to bother, I would
9 suggest, people in Louisiana, but elsewhere is that if two
10 Piros collide on an inland waterway, that not only gives this
11 certainly trivial incident access to a federal court, which
12 may not be bad, but it gives it access to an entire field of
13 law.
f

I would suggest to you by the time the court started

14 carving out exceptions to make this thing work, that that's
15 where the confusion would turn into.

I don't know what

16 plaintiff would have done if I would have tried to limit my
17 liability.
18

QUESTION;

In your example, the water that you are

19 talking about would be navigable.

It is navigable, those

20 inland waterways, and error to commercial fishing boats.
21

NR. ANDREWS;

22

QUESTION;

That is right.

But that is not a good enough connection

23 with commerce?

24

QUESTION;

You're talking about, Your Honor, the

25 type of boats we are dealing with, so yes, I would say no, it

1 isn't good enough.

And because we are also talking about the

2 water bodies.

As the Court is aware, —

QUESTIONs

What about Justice Stevens' example of

5 90% pleasure boat water and 10% commercial?

I would say so.

That is right, in the same location.

What would happen in the little area

17 between Baton Rouge and Louisiana if two boats with two kids
18 in them, netting for crawfish?

I guess they would be covered.

19 t oo .
20

NR. ANDREWS*

Under the Fifth Circuit's Kelly v.

21 Smith, that is admiralty.

And that is what I think is wrong

22 with it, Your Honors, and that is why I believe that if you do
23 look at the location, and as it moves inshore, there is just
24 not that need to have admiralty jurisdiction apply, and that
25 is why there ought to be more of a commercial flavor.

1

QUESTION*

I wonder, do I get you that if the

2 particular body of water — for our basic premise, of course,
(

3 it is navigable — is a commercial highway of some kind, then
4 the fact that there's a collision of two pleasure boats on the
5 commercial highway, that is admiralty?
6

NB. ANDREWS*

7

QUESTION*

I would say that is.

Whereas, as you suggest in this case, the

8 body of water may be navigable but it is not a commercial
9 highway, and therefore, these two pleasure boats, it is not
10 admiralty.

But if two commercial fishermen collided at the

11 very spot that these two collided, it would be admiralty.

Is

12 that right?
i
f

HR. ANDREWS*

13

I think that is correct.

I would

14 agree with the trial judge —
15

QUESTION*

Wouldn't that get the courts —

16

HR. ANDREWS*

It is confusing.

The Fifth Circuit

17 suggested that one of the reasons they would not apply the
18 rule is that it would be a difficult test to administer.
19

at the locality alone rule that we've got here.

Look

Certainly, if

20 there is a test difficult to administer, it is that.
21

QUESTION*

Well, if the test were only did it happen

22 on navigable water, federally regulable, if it did, then it's
23 admiralty.

That would be a much simpler test, wouldn't it?

24

HR. ANDREWS*

25

QUESTION:

There's no question that it —

Well, didn't the Fifth Circuit say that

|
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the test was navigable or capable of being made navigable, so
2 that it isn’t something that is an automatic proof by simply
3 looking at the location.
4

MR. ANDREWS;

No, sir.

That is true.

The Fifth

5 Circuit did not go on location; it said that a collision
6 between two vessels, regardless of whether they are pleasure,
7 the fact that there is a collision is a traditional maritime
8 activity.
9

QUESTION;

And one couldn't apply their test without

10 — not knowing either whether the water was navigable or
11

whether it was capable of being made navigable.

12

MR. ANDREWS;

I think that that is correct because I

13 believe that the Fifth Circuit was talking about navigability
14 in the same sense that it has historically — streams have
15 historically been considered navigable for commerce clause
16 purposes.
QUESTION;

17

They say it takes 6A, if the waterway is

18 capable of being used in commerce.

That is the sufficient

19 threshold to invoke admiralty jurisdiction.

20

MR. ANDREWS;

21

QUESTION;

That is right.

That means it has to be navigable, in

22 fact.
23
24 the

MR. ANDREWS;

11

QUESTION*

12

That is right.

We don't have —

They remanded it, didn't they?

Didn't

they remand —
HR. ANDREWS*

13

No.

The Fifth Circuit reversed the

14

district court and we had one concurring opinion in part and a

15

dissent in part by Judge Thornberry who would have remanded to

16

determine the navigability, in fact, of this particular

17

stream.

18

Guard, I believe the Corps of Engineers, as to the nature of

19

the stream at this particular point.

In the record, there is some evidence from the Coast

That issue of

20 navigability, in fact, was never tried, nor recognized by the
21

22

court.
QUESTION;

Do you think the court of appeals held

23

that it was navigable?

24

HR. ANDREWS*

25

It did not hold that.

I think if you

will look at that portion of the opinion in the Joint

1 Appendix, I believe the words that the Fifth Circuit was that
2 "we recognize" from the record that this area is not used for
3 commerce or seldom, if ever, used I believe is the word that
4 they used.

So that the issue of navigability in fact has

5 really never been adjudicated.

Judge Thornberry would send it

6 back.
7

We haven’t asked for that remedy here because we

8 want you to look at the commercial aspects of it, as we did in
9 the district court and as we did in the Fifth Circuit.

I

10 think that that is an important thing to look at.
11

QUESTIONS

Mr. Andrews, are you approaching your

12 argument as a matter of constitutional law or statutory law?
13

MR. ANDREWSs

I think that we’re probably talking

14 about Article III jurisdiction of the U.S. Constitution, yes.
15

QUESTIONS

Certainly, the statute, Section 1333,

16 might be narrower than Article Ill's language.
17

MR. ANDREWSs

18

QUESTIONS

19

MR. ANDREWSs

20 Your Honor.

I think that that is correct.

Is that your view?
As far as the -- I don’t really know,

I don’t know if I can answer that intelligently

21 for you right now.
22

QUESTIONS

Let me ask you another question.

There

23 is a statute, it’s 46 U.S. Code Section 740, which extends
24 admiralty and maritime jurisdiction to all cases of damage or
25 injury caused by a vessel on navigable water.

I think that it does include pleasure

That Extension of Admiralty Act is a legislative

6 enactment, and I think, too, that the —

QUESTION*

7

Then, is this case governed by that

8 statute?
9

MR. ANDREWS*

10

QUESTION*

11

MR. ANDREWS*

No, it is not governed by that statute.

Why not?
As I pointed out in my brief, the

12 Fifth Circuit — and I pointed it out for another purpose, but
13

I think that the case is applicable here — there is a case

14

cited in my brief that is the Sohyde Drilling Company case.

15

In Louisiana and Texas, we are very familiar with offshore

16

drilling, and we have some very specialized vessels that

17

sometimes are vessels and sometimes are islands.

18

particular vessel was an island at the time of this injury in

19

that it was a submersible drilling platform that was drilling

This

20 on the bottom of the lake.
21

The action was attempted to be brought under the

22 Admiralty Extension Act.

The Fifth Circuit in that opinion

23

said that there ought to be some commercial traditional nexus

24

of the activity and the complained-of injury in order to

25

support admiralty jurisdiction.

So —
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE- S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

Well, that may not be a correct

2 interpretation of that language in the statute, which
3 certainly on its face would literally include pleasure boats
4 unless pleasure boats are not vessels.
5

MB. ANDREWS;

I think that that boat — I think that

6 pleasure boats would be vessels under the Act.

And if there

7 was some damage to a shore-based plaintiff or to an extension
8 of land that was caused by a vessel, including a pleasure
9 craft, in navigation, then I believe there would be supportive
10 jurisdiction in a federal admiralty court under the Extension
11 of Admiralty Act.
12

There are other legislative expansions, I would

13 suggest, of the jurisdiction; notably, Death on the High Seas
14 Act, the limitation of liability acts, which are legislative
15 encroachments upon traditionally-defined jurisprudential
16 jurisdictional guidelines.
17

QUESTION;

Well, we've never held they've gone too

18 far, have we?
19

MR. ANDREWS;

I don’t think that I can complain that

20 you 've gone too far in any event, so far.
21

QUESTION;

And we've sustained those statutes,

22 haven't we?
23

MR. ANDREWS;

24

QUESTION;

That is correct.

And said that Congress could define those

25 things for us?

It does go rather far, but it is —

6 and one of the reasons that I would suggest to the Court that
7 we needed it was because at that time, the Court was primarily
8 looking at locality alone.

And certainly, we had some awkward

9 results when we were applying that law, and the Extension of
10 Admiralty Act eliminated a lot of the injustices that were
11 just inherent in the application of that Act.

12

I think that it’s time that we do look at a little

13 something else.

We need something.

One of the groups of

14 scholars would indicate that they would have maritime nexus
15 without any need for the location to be important.
16 think that this Court ought to go that far.

I don’t

If we look at the

17 contract cases in the maritime field, we haven't had a heck of
18 a lot of problems with it because despite the fact that we’re
19 talking about contract, we have been talking about requiring a

20 maritime nexus there which is almost inevitably commercial.
21 And we simply haven’t had those problems in the contract,

22 maritime contract field that we have in the maritime personal
23 injury when we have applied the locality alone test, but with
24 the advent of all this pleasure boating and pleasure and sport
25 fishing.

So something ought to be done.

I would suggest to

2 you that what I have proposed, and as Professor Benedict
3 points out, I think that's a workable solution.

I think, too,

4 that that rule would also help in the real puzzling question
5 of aircraft litigation and aircraft collisions at sea.
6 Because there, too, we are talking about — once we are
7 talking about international flights, for example, from New
8 York to London and a crash in the middle of the Atlantic, we
9 are talking — and we start talking about the traditional role
10 of the maritime services in transporting passengers from one
11

country to another.

Then there, we don't need that much of a

12 connection to traditional notions of maritime activity, so
13 that you are not doing any injustice or abusing language to
14 try to make something fit in both categories.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

15

It is the respondents' position herein, Your Honors,

16 that the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals case is correct in
17 encompassing and saying that the factual situation herein is
18 encompassed within the admiralty jurisdiction of this Court.
19 Admiralty law has traditionally,

I would suggest, been

20 concerned with navigation, navigation rules and collisions
21 which occur on navigable waterways.
22

The case of Executive Jet, this Court’s case,

23 Aviation v.

City of Ohio, tells us that, and Justice Stewart,

24 writing the majority says that the law of admiralty deals with
25 navigation rules.

The rules that govern the manner and

1 direction vessels move upon navigable water, and he further
2 states that when a collision occurs, the litigants will look
3 to the law of admiralty with its peculiar expertise in this
4 field to determine the nature of damages and fault and
5 liability.
6

QUESTION*

What case were you referring to?

7

MR. MARTIN:

This is the Supreme Court case,

8 Executive Jet Aviation v. City of Ohio, Your Honor.

The same

9 premise, of course, is recognized in lower court opinions.
10 The St. Hilaire Moye case which is cited in the brief, v.
11 Henderson, Eight Circuit case, together with Kelly v. Smith of
12 the Fifth Circuit, both recognize that admiralty law has
13 traditionally furnished remedies for those injured while
14 traveling navigable waters.
15

Then we have the problem with the three prior

16 Executive Jet Supreme Court cases of Levinson v. Deupree,
17 Coryell v. Phipps and Just v. Chambers, which seem to me to
18 indicate that the traditional remedies that this Court has
19 furnished for those who are injured while traversing navigable

20 waters is not merely lost because pleasure boats were involved.

21

QUESTION:

What is your definition of a navigable

22 water?
23
24 of course,

MR. MARTIN:

Your Honor, I would use the definition,

that comes from the Daniel Ball case, that first it

25 has to be navigable, in fact,

and that it is navigable in fact

1 when it is susceptible of commerce in its ordinary state, and
2 it is susceptible of commerce when it by itself or along with
3 other streams, forms a continuous highway over which commerce
4 can be adapted.

And the Amite River here, I would submit,

But under the

definition you want and the Fifth Circuit, if it's a navigable

HR. MARTIN*

Well, I would submit that if it is

16

susceptible to supporting commerce, whether it be in the

17

middle of the stream or on the end of the stream and so forth,

18

yes, under the Supreme Court case, Daniel Ball, it is

19

navigable because — this Amite River, you must understand, it

20 flows, it bottoms out into Lake Maurepas, which also connects
21

to the Pontchartrain, and from the Pontchartrain, this river

22 can give access to commerce, not only within the state of

25

Louisiana, but with other states and also, international trade.
QUESTION*

Do we know anything about the depth of

the Amite at the point these boats —

HR. MARTIN;

Yes, Your Honor.

2 it's the Corps of Engineers report.

The record — I think

No, it*s the Department

3 of Army report which is in the record at pages 103 to 119,
4 shows the depth of the Amite River near the point of collision
5 to be eight feet, within a range permissible for commercial
6 vessel use.

Now, I don't know if they measured — I'm sure

7 that that would be the deepest point.
8

QUESTION*

Could the jurisdictional issue possibly

9 be resolved on the depth of the water right under the boats at
10 the time they collided?

The Atlantic Ocean is very shallow

11 right by the shore and so is the Mississippi River with a
12 nine-foot channel in the center.

But the entire river of

13 Mississippi is a navigable stream, isn't it?
14

MR. MARTIN;

Yes, Your Honor.

And I would submit

15 that within the definition that we have of navigability, the
16 Amite River meets that definition here, at the point of the
17 collision and further on down.

I think it is susceptible of

18 commerce, and indeed, we have documentation in the record that
19 shows that it might, in fact, be engaged in commerce because

20 there are certain bridge openings along the river, and it's
21 part of the record, too, it’s the Department of Transportation
22 report and record 136 through 139 reveals that at the time of
23 the accident, there were numerous openings of bridges for
24 vessels along the Amite River.

And it’s not the type of situation

3 that we have in Adams v. Montana where you have a stream which
4 is dammed on both ends —
5

QUESTIONS

Sometimes, you open the bridge for a

6 small boat with a very high mast.
7

MB. MARTINs

That’s correct. Your Honor, and

8 sometimes you would open it, and I believe the record will
9 reflect, sometimes the bridges will open merely for
10 maintenance purposes.

But they are differentiated in that

11 record, and sometimes they were open for vessels or whatever
12 nature.
13

But the Fifth Circuit I believe had to conclude that

14 this river certainly was navigable under the definition of
15 these courts in order to find admiralty jurisdiction.
16

QUESTION*

And I -

Judge Thornberry would have remanded for

17 the sort of finding that you suggest could be made but wasn’t
18 made — whether it was commercially used.
19

MR. MARTINs

Is that correct?

Yes, sir, that is how I understand his

20 dissent in that case.
21

Your Honor, it would be submitted that the proper

22 focus should not be on profit or commerce, but the proper
23 focus should be to equate traditional maritime activities with
24 waterbound vessels.

And if you adopted a test in that order,

25 we would see that we would be working with a simple test.

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
Ann Virginia

avp

s \a/ WASHINGTON n o onnoA tor\o\

spa-osap

It

1 would be almost as simple as locality.

If there is a

2 waterbound vessel involved, then there is admiralty
3 jurisdiction.

Because these pleasure boats can cause as much

4 problems to commerce and to the freedom of navigation on these
5 navigable streams if they collide as two commercial vessels.
6 Me recognize that commercial vessels and fishing vessels come
7 in all sizes, — I mean pleasure vessels come in all sizes,
8 and a pleasure boat is not relegated like your large pleasure
9 lots and so forth, to interstate waters, but can traverse
10 international waters.

The test is irrational, in my opinion,

11 if you place it on profit or commerce.
12

Now, if we adopted, or if you adopted the test which

13 would equate the traditional maritime nexus with waterbound
14 vessels, I think you would be excluding those cases that this

MR. MARTINs

That gets a little bit — if the

10 think that there is a possibility of navigability.

Certainly,

11 if the boat that the waterskier has been pulled by collides
12 with another vessel, pleasure or otherwise, yes, there would
13 be admiralty law.

QUESTION*

What if the boat the waterskier is being

MR. MARTIN*

Yes, the waterbound vessel is involved

It's a hazard of navigability.

5 interest in this area in protecting navigation.

A collision

6 between those two private vessels presents a hazard to another
7

commercial vessel or commerce on that river, and that's where

8 the federal interest comes in because admiralty law recognizes
9

that.

That's why I would say the difference is there.
QUESTION*

10

Mr. Martin, would you say that — just

11 directing your attention to the manufacturer's defect
12

suggestion.

Is the issue — is unseaworthiness of a vessel a

13

traditional area of state or federal jurisdiction, would you

14

say ?

15

MR. MARTIN:

It's federal jurisdiction, I would say.

16

But I am saying that if we're going to define

17

traditional maritime nexus — and I agree that there should be

18

some definition of that and there should be more than locality

19

— to limit the type of cases that come before this Court and

20 so forth, I’m saying that the proper test should not be on
21

commerce or profit, because it produces irrational results.

22 We might not be able to determine if there's a fishing boat
23

right down here and this man over here is engaged in selling

24

his fish in a very small vessel, but he's engaged in selling

25

his fish for a living to a seafood outlet, well, to this

He doesn’t have

2 the words "commerce" written across his vessel.

So then the

But later on, we find out he was selling those fish

QUESTIONt

Does the man in the little fishing boat

7 get maintenance inshore if he got injured?
8

MB. MARTIN:

Could he get maintenance and care?

No,

9 sir, he’d have to be a seaman for that, and I don’t think he
10 would be a seaman.
11

QUESTION:

Why wouldn’t he be a seaman?

12

MR. MARTIN:

13

QUESTION*

14

MR. MARTIN*

15

QUESTION:

Because he’s not —
He was at sea, according to you.
I don’t think it would —

Maritime law only applies to sea, doesn’t

16 it?
17

MR. MARTIN:

No.

I think maritime law is broader

18 than the Jones Act seamen type cases and so forth.
19

QUESTION:

20

MR. MARTIN:

21 broader than that.

That’s what I’m trying to say.
Yes, sir, I think maritime law is

but the collision part of admiralty.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DORSEY C. MARTIN, III, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS (Continued)

6

MR. MARTIN*

You may continue, counsel.

Your Honors, it is submitted under

7 either of the tests that have developed in the circuit courts.
8 attempting to define what this Court meant by traditional
9 wrong bearing a significant relationship to traditional
10 maritime activities.

Either the test of St. Hilaire Moye v.

11 Henderson of the Eight Circuit saying that the traditional
12 maritime nexus is met when a waterbound vessel is involved, or
,3 the test of Kelly v. Smith of the Fifth Circuit saying that
J

14 traditional maritime nexus is met when the totality of the
15 circumstances, considering the role and instrumentality, the
16 causation and the parties involved.
17

Under either one of these tests, the facts of this

18 case support admiralty jurisdiction.

All vessels applying on

19 navigable waters, regardless of their size or commercial
20 status, face these unique hazards of the waters which maritime
21 law, due to its continued experience, is peculiarly suited to
22 handle.
23

It is submitted, Your Honor, that because the Fifth

24 Circuit case in this matter recognizes the traditional concept
25 of admiralty law in regard to the factual situation of this
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

)

1 case, that Fifth Circuit case promotes the federal interest in
2 keeping our navigable waters free from maritime uses, and also
3 promotes uniformity of commerce and makes jurisdiction readily
4 ascertainable before a collision, not after a collision, and a
5 determination by the courts as to whether or not there is a
6 substantial commercial interest involved; i.e., federal rules
7 of admiralty, or whether it is purely pleasurable, invoking
8 state rules.
9

And because the Fifth Circuit case provides a

10 rational, simple test that is not all-inclusive that would
11 accomplish what this Court would like like to do in
12 eliminating certain cases which do not have a nexus to
SJ

13 admiralty law from being heard in admiralty, that it should be
14 upheld.
15

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Very well.

Do you have

16 anything further?
17

MR. ANDREWS*

Your Honor, I don't want to take any

18 rebuttal; I would like to point out to the Court because it is
19 not in my brief, but the record will support my statement that
20 after this collision, one of the passengers on my vessel waded
21 over to plaintiff and pulled him ashore, so we’re talking
22 about water that is less than waist deep in this location.
23

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Very well, thank you.

24 gentlemen, the case is submitted.
