ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. WESTER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. WESTERs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case is here on certiorari to the

10

Fourth Circuit and presents two issues of employment

11

discrimination law.

12

employer's potential back pay liability to a

13

discrimination claimant continues to accrue after the

14

claimant has rejected the employer's unconditional job

15

offer of employment.

16

The first issue is whether an

The second issue is whether Ford was

17

improperly required to prove its explanation for its

18

employment decisions in this case.

19

the back pay issue may well affect the handling of

20

almost any employment discrimination case in which an

21

employer finds itself able to offer employment to a

22

discrimination claimant before the determination of the

23

merits of the claim.

24
25

The resolution of

The facts essential to the resolution of this
issue may be stated briefly.

On July 21, 1971, Judy

Judy Gaddis and Rebecca Starr applied to work at the

Ford Kotor Company's parts warehouse in Charlotte, North

months.

Neither Ms. Gaddis nor Ms. Starr resumed

10

regular employment again until January of 1973, although

11

Ford did employ both women in its parts warehouse for

12

some six weeks in late 1972.

13

months after the women had returned to work at General

14

Motors, Ford had a vacancy for a permanent warehouse

job, the same job for which Ms. Gaddis and Ms. Starr had

initially applied.

QUESTION:

2

NR. WESTER:

How long after?
The offers to these claimants

3

occurred some two years following the charges that were

4

filed, nearly two years.

5

Neither of Ford's offers included seniority or

6

back pay, nor did either offer require Ms. Gaddis or Ms.

7

Starr to abandon any aspect of their discrimination

8

claims against Ford.

9

the Commission brought this suit.

Two years later, in July of 1975,
The district court

10

concluded that Ford had discriminated against Gaddis and

11

Starr when it did not hire them in 1971, and also

12

concluded that Ford's offers in 1973 had no effect on

13

the amount of back pay.

MR. WESTER:

QUESTION:

17
18

Well, are you saying -Ford's back pay.
Are you saying that when the offer

of reinstatement was made, it was rejected out of hand?
MR. WESTER:

19 in both cases.

I am saying that it was rejected

Yes, sir.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WESTER:

22

QUESTION:

With no conditions —
That's correct.
-- except that the employees said

23

they wouldn't come back unless.

24

MR. WESTER:

No.

Is that it?

No, Your Honor.

Let me say

25 that there were no conditions attached to the offer by

evidence is that both testified to Ford’s administrative

3

clerk who delivered the offers by wire and by telephone,

4

that neither wanted to be the only woman in the

warehouse.

6

wanted to be the only woman.

7

And neither woman mentioned, I might add, any claim for

you were — at least an intimation that the employees

13

were attaching conditions.

MR. WESTER*

15

QUESTION:

No, sir, they did not.
Mr. Wester, is it clear what the

16

salary, the wage rate that was offered was?

17

would have been paid when they were originally denied

18

employment, or was it the current wage rate?

There has been no guestion about that in the

And was the wage rate the same as

it had been in 1971?

There has

will recall from the statement of facts, just previous

to that, and from all the record shows, they were

They were not.

And if they had been there that

20

long, would they have not only seniority, but would they

21

have had higher wages?

SR. WESTER:

They would have had the wages

determined by the bargaining agreement with the United

Auto Workers.

QUESTION;

Hr. Wester, is it your position

that the claims for both women should be tolled, even
though only one job was available?
MR. WESTER*

Yes, Your Honor, because both

women were offered jobs.

Ms. Gaddis, who declined it.

Starr, and she declined it.

The offers occurred first to
Then it was offered to Ms.
That is cur position.

15

The district court held Ford’s liability to

16

Gaddis and Starr with allowances for interim earnings

17

extended to the end of 1977, the date the Court entered

18

its findings in the case.

19

Circuit affirmed its conclusion rejecting Ford’s

20

contention that its unconditional offers of employment

21

cut off the accrual of back pay.

22

Over a dissent, the Fourth

Ford submits that the Fourth Circuit’s holding

23

should be reversed, first because it is unfair to

24

employers, to incumbent employees, and to claimants,

25

second, because it is unworkable for the Title VII

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

process, and third, because there is a rule available

2

that is better in all respects, and that is the rule

3

followed by the National Labor Relations Board and the

4

circuit courts reviewing the Board’s decisions.

5

The Fourth Circuit’s holding means that an

6

employer charged with employment discrimination can be

7

assured that a job offer will stop the accrual of back,

8

pay liability only by offering not only the job

9

initially sought, but also retroactive seniority, and as

10

the court of appeals’ reasoning indicates, back pay as

11

well.

12

employer must offer the claimant essentially all relief

13

that the claimant could be awarded should he or she

14

ultimately prevail at a trial.

15

Thus, to shut off the back pay meter, the

The practical effect of this holding is to

16

require that employers give up any meaningful right to

17

contest and defend against the claimant's allegations.

18

The Fourth Circuit’s rule is also unfair to incumbent

19

employees, because job offers that comply with the

20

Fourth Circuit's rule will undermine their seniority

21

rights, although these employees are third parties

22

totally removed from the discrimination controversy.

MR. WESTER;

discrimination.

The offer is made --

3

QUESTION;

The offer is made following the

alleged discriminatory act.

made, the matter of discrimination is a matter of

allegation alone.

10

QUESTION;

At the moment the offer is

But isn't that the way we have to

accept this case, as though there was discrimination?
HR. WESTER;

To the contrary.

It is

11

fundamental tc our position that the Court understand

12

the posture in which these offers were made, that is,

13

before any finding of discrimination.

14

question that this Court has stated that both back pay

15

and retroactive seniority would have to be provided, if

16

there was to be a valid offer or a reinstatement offer

17

following, or instatement offer for this case, following

18

a finding of discrimination.

19

case, this offer occurred before a suit was even

20

brought, and some four years before a finding of

21

discrimination.

QUESTION;

There is no

To the contrary, in this

Would you take the same legal

23

position if there had been a finding but you were

appealing it?

HR. WESTER;

I would. Your Honor.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

QUESTION;

You would still say that

2

notwithstanding the finding, as long as you make an

3

offer, that would cut off back pay from the date of the

4

MR. WESTER;

adjudication of discrimination.

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. WESTER;

9

Yes, because there still is no

Yes.
Yes, Your Honor.

Yes, Justice

Stevens.

10

The Fourth Circuit's rule is unfair to

11

incumbent employees because it requires an employer to

12

award seniority to a claimant who has never worked for

13

that employer, although such an award will necessarily

14

dislodge from their positions on the seniority ladder

15

all employees who have been hired subsequent to the date

16

the applicants applied for work -- the claimants applied

17

for work.

18

bargaining agreement, the award of seniority will breach

19

any standard seniority provision of that agreement.

20

Apart from the obligations under any such

If the employer is a party to a collective

21

agreement, however, an employer in Ford’s view should

22

not be encouraged to protect itself from continuing back

23

pay liability by sacrificing the interest of present

24

employees who have earned and who rely upon their

25

seniority standing.

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

This Court's decisions have carefully

2

delineated the basis upon which seniority rights of

3

incumbent employees may be altered.

4

decision, this Court -- the predicate set by this Court

5

for permitting those seniority rights to be affected was

6

either a finding of discrimination or the adoption

7

through collective bargaining of a comprehensive,

8

narrowly drawn, and temporary affirmative action plan

9

designed so as not to affect unnecessarily the seniority

10

In each such

interest of employees in the plant.

11

The Fourth Circuit's rule, we submit, has no

12

such foundation.

13

make self-interested ad hoc decisions whether in any

14

given case the employer wishes to cut off its back pay

15

liability instead of — cut off its back pay liability

16

at the expense of the seniority interest of incumbent

17

employees.

18

Instead, it encourages an employer to

QUESTION:

Well, just how would that affect

19

the seniority of incumbent employees, Mr. Wester, if you

20

simply hired people?

21

kind of advanced seniority?

22

MR. WESTER:

Don’t you have to hire them with

To the contrary.

What was

23

necessary here for Fori to do, and the rule that it

24

advocates this Court should adopt in this case, is

25

precisely what it did, make an offer, make an

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

unconditional offer that there are no strings attached

2

to the prosecution of the claim, but without any rights

3

of seniority that may be indeed the due of the claimants

4

once they have established a claim.

5

QUESTIONi

6

MR. WESTER:

7

QUESTION*

Mr. Wester —
Yes.
-- I am still confused.

Are you

8

saying that this record does not show a finding of

9

discrimination on account of sex here?

10

MR. WESTER:

It certainly does show such a

11

finding, Your Honor, and the key to that — and the key

12

to that is that it occurred, the finding, at a trial

13

some four years following the date these unconditional

14

offers were made, and the key to our position --

15
16
17

QUESTION:

How do you avoid that?

I mean, you

are hung with that finding, aren’t you?
MR. WESTER:

Well, Your Honor, the second

18

issue in the case is whether or not the finding was

19

proper, whether the correct burden of proof was applied,

20

but putting that aside, we are by no means hung with the

21

finding for the purposes of analyzing the first issue,

22

the back pay issue, and the reason for that is that the

23

employer ought be entitled to a cutoff of further back

24

pay liability.

25

and should be held liable for sex discrimination. Ford

Let me emphasize that if Ford is indeed

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is liable, but throught the point of the offer for back,

2

pay and seniority, and there can be no question of

3

that.

4

point, there is no subsequently accuring back pay

5

liability because it is shut off by the unconditional

6

offer that Ford makes.

Our point is that past that point, past that

7

QUESTION;

8

HR. WESTERs

9

But you didn't offer seniority.
Quite right.

We did not, nor

should we have, for if we had, it would have required

10

the surrender difficulty that I have just described, and

11

would have also impacted certainly on the seniority

12

interest of other incumbents.

13

QUESTIONS

14

are not made whole.

15

Which means that the complainants

HR. WESTER;

Precisely.

They are not made

16

whole at the time the offer is made, but they give up no

17

item whatever, in no respect whatever, their ultimate

18

right to be made whole.

19
20

21

QUESTION:

You mean, they could continue

litigating it.
HR. WESTER:

Absolutely, and that is the crux

22

of our position, and because they can continue

23

litigating. Ford's back pay liability should have ended.

24
25

QUESTION;

What you are saying is, in effect,

that eventually these claims will be resolved by a

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

court, and the court will decide what things in addition

2

to employment, back pay, and that sort of thing, if

3

anything, the successful plaintiff should get, but that

4

the employer before that sort of a determination is made

5

or before a finding of discrimination is made, the

6

employer should have some way of limiting the back pay

7

liability when he does not know what the outcome of the

8

lawsuit will be.

9

NR. WESTER*

That is our entire argument.

In

10

fact, it would seem to us, in light of this Court's

11

holding in Franks, that an award of retroactive

12

seniority is not always appropriate even after a finding

13

of liability, that it would be anomalous to require an

14

employer just to cut off subsequently accruing back

15

liability to throw in an award of retroactive seniority

16

that may turn out never to have been appropriate at all.

17

The rule followed that we advocate and that I

18

have — the rule we advocate in this case is a rule that

19

has been developed by the National Labor Relations

20

Board, and followed by all of the circuits who have

21

reviewed the Board's findings on this issue.

22

National Labor Relations Board has consistently held

23

that an unconditional offer of reinstatement or of

24

employment tolls any subsequent accrual of back pay

25

liability.

1

The remedial provision of Title VII, as this

2

Court has noted on several occasions, is derived from

3

the National Labor Relations Act so that the Board's

4

decisions provide again in this case, as they did --

5

QUESTION:

Counsel, I have trouble with your

6

unconditional offer which denies seniority status.

7

Unconditional, and denied.

8
9

NR. WESTER*

Is there any tension there?

I think not, Your Honor.

The key

is that Ford was obliged to make an offer of the job
(

10

initially sought, about which there has been no dispute,

11

and --

12
13

QUESTION;

job at half the salary.

14
15

MR. WESTER;

QUESTION;

Suppose you offered them a job with

MR. WESTER;
would not be good.

20

21

Would that be good?

That would be — No, sir, that

The key is —

QUESTION:

Well, you offered it with no

seniority.

MR. WESTER:

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. WESTER*

25

No, sir, that would not be good,

half of their seniority.

18
19

Would that be good?

because Ford was obliged —

16
17

Well, suppose you had offered her a

That is exactly right, Your Honor.
Which is worse.
No, sir, half seniority would

have been bad just like full seniority is bad.

2

had to offer was none.
QUESTION:

You mean to give somebody full

3

seniority hurts them?

4

HR. WESTER;

It would have hurt -- it would

5

have required Ford — by no means would it have hurt

6

them, but it would have required Ford to surrender its

7

right to defend against senioirty benefits that the

8

claimant would enjoy.

9
10
11

QUESTION;

And it would also require them to

pay some money, too.
MR. WESTER;

And would also -- absolutely.

12

And would also require the impact on the third parties

13

in the plant, the other employees.

14
15

QUESTION;

That to my mind is not an

unconditional offer.

16

HR. WESTER;

17

QUESTION;

18

Well, Your Honor, I was —
To the contrary, it is a

conditioned offer.

19

MR. WESTER;

20

QUESTION;

All right, sir.

I —

We will give you a job provided you

21

waive your seniority.

22

MR. WESTER;

No, sir.

That is exactly -- it

23

is important that I note that is not what Ford offered.

24

Ford did not make any such offer in this case.

25

contrary, its offer did not require in any respect, and

Are you saying they could still

MR. WESTER;

Precisely.

That is exactly what

The offer was unconditional.

never been challenged in either court as other than

MR. WESTER:

I understand that, but I think

3

this Court in Burdine actually just more fully stated,

4

perhaps, the standards of proof and what was required to

5

meet those standards, and it seems to me that as I read

6

Footnote 5, what actually it does show is that Ford did

7

not satisfy at the rebuttal stage the district court of

8

the truth of its explanation, and that was a matter left

9

for the pretext stage.

Ford was therefore convicted, so

10

to speak, on the force of the prima facie case, and was

11

denied the effect of a rebuttal it should have had.

12

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Wester, on this same

point, didn't the court in the footnote say that Ford

Honor, through the evidence it introduced into trial,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. STRAUSS, ESQ.,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2

MR. STRAUSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

3

please the Court, I will first address the back pay

4

issue.

5

principle governs this case, although we don't think,

6

that conclusion is obvious, but there is no support,

7

either in the law developed under the Labor Act or in

8

the logic of the Labor Act principle for holding that

9

the July, 1973, offer to Gaddis and Starr cut off their

10
11

We are willing to assume arguendo that the NLRA

back pay awards at that date.
The best way to understand what that principle

12

is and why those offers did not cut off the back pay

13

awards is to understand the rationale of the Labor Act

14

principle, and that straightforward rationale is that if

15

an employer can ensure that after a certain date an

16

employee will suffer no further effects from an alleged

17

discriminatory act, then the employer should not

18

continue to accrue liability after that date.

19

In other words, if the July, 1973, offer had

20

placed Gaddis and Starr in such a position that after

21

that date they would not continue to suffer the effects

22

of the Petitioner’s discriminatory refusal to hire them,

23

then under tha Labor Act principle Petitioner would not

24

continue to accrue back pay liability, but the July,

25

1973, offer to Gaddis and Starr was not sufficient to

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

prevent further injury to them because that offer left

2

them at a continuing seniority disadvantage.

3

at a two-year seniority disadvantage that was entirely

4

the result of Petitioner's refusal to hire them in 1971.

5

QUESTION:

How did this injure them, pending

6

resolution finally of the issue?

MR. STRAUSS:

Hell, it would have injured them

5

MR. STRAUSS:

6

QUESTION:

7
8

9

Well, isn't that very

Well, it may veil be.

I mean, it really puts him on a

spot.
MR. STRAUSS:

It may well be that the employer

has given up his right to make the sort of offer that

10

would be necessary to cut off the back pay award in the

11

course of collective bargaining, but that is no

12

different from many litigants who find that their

13

chances to improve their litigating position by making a

14

settlement offer or in some other way to improve their

15

position are blocked by a contract they have entered for

16

mutual advantage.

17

QUESTION:

And even if they haven't given it

18

up in an agreement, which might be the typical case, but

19

even if they haven't, then what does that do to the

20

innocent other employees who are affected by inserting

21

someone laterally?

22

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, there are really two

23

points to be made about that.

24

O'Connor, is that those employees are only being placed

25

in the position they would have been in had the employer

The first, Justice

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

never discriminated, but the second, and perhaps more

2

fundamental, is that the court of appeals holding

3

doesn’t do anything to the rights of those employees.

4

Whatever rights they have for breach of the collective

5

bargaining agreement or whatever remain intact, and

6

unaffected by this decision.

7

QUESTION:

Well, but rights similar to that

8

will be affected in the future if the Fourth Circuit’s

9

opinion stands, because then the employers will be given

10

an incentive to place someone in a higher seniority

11

position than opening, so to speak.

12

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, if their collective

13

bargaining agreement permits it, they will presumably do

14

that, but if the collective bargaining agreement permits

15

it, then there is no sense in which the incumbent

16

employees have rights, because they have only the rights

17

given to them by the collective agreement.

18

QUESTION:

Will you spell out for me exactly

19

what offer Ford should have made to these people, in

20

your estimation?

21

MR. STRAUSS:

It should have said, to

22

summarize, that they will be put in the position in 1973

23

they would have been in had they been hired in 1971.

24

those jobs were now — if they would have received a

25

routine pay increase or routine promotion, they would he

If

received two years* seniority, they would be entitled to

3

those two years* seniority with the company, health and

4

life insurance benefits, and layoff protection.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

2

employer made that kind of an offer, they committed an

3

unfair labor practice?

HE. STRAUSS:

Is that it?

would have committed an unfair labor practice.

6

might have violated the collective bargaining.

QUESTION:

And open the company up to a

HE. STRAUSS:

Well, that's right, but the

10

issue is whether Gaddis and Starr's back pay award is

11

going to be cut off.

12

that the amount of their back pay award depends on the

13

terms of the collective bargaining agreement that Ford

14

entered for its advantage with the collective bargaining

15

representative of the employees.

16

collective bargaining agreements that would permit this

17

sort of remedial slotting in, and if there were, there

18

could be no claim.

not be made.

MR. STRAUSS*

Oh, of course they could

QUESTION*

11

MR. STRAUSS*

That is what I am suggesting.
They can continue -- well, they

12

can continue to litigate the issues, no matter what.

13

The question is whether they can cut off the back pay

14

award, and in order to cut off the back pay award, they

15

have to ensure that that employee will not be injured

16

after the date at which they proposed to cut it off.

There isn't.

That’s right.

There is no back pay award, of course.

You still tell me that if they lose

Would you say that?

They are in the same position as

MR. STRAUSS;

As far as cutting off the back

pay award is concerned.

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. STRAUSS*

Cutting — everything.

Everything.

Well, that’s right, because the

offer was neither sufficient to cut off the back pay

award nor did it give them an opportunity to mitigate

19

damages which they did not take.

20

QUESTION*

Incidentally, Mr. Strauss, is there

21

any significance in the fact that at the time the offer

22

was made they were both employed at GM?

MR. STRAUSS*

Well, that is significant to the

HR. STRAUSS:

Well, it wouldn’t be cut off,

because all the wages they earned at GM would be

It was an effort

to reduce the amount they would be liable for, but it

comes to us in the posture that Ford has been found to

if the seniority is offered provisionally, that is,

provisionally on their winning the lawsuit?

4

NR, STRAUSS*

Well, at that point, they are

5

still placed in a position that is less secure than they

6

would have been had they not been discriminated against,

Oh, of course it is less secure,

but maybe they didn't deserve any more security.

They keep their job.

They just

don’t keep the seniority.
MR. STRAUSS*

Well, I think that is what the

14

mitigation principle is designed to deal with.

15

then the question becomes, was it reasonable for them to

16

keep the jobs they had gone out and found after they

17

were discriminated against, as opposed to taking Ford's

18

job, and the two courts below found that it was

19

reasonable and —

20
21

QUESTION*

I think

Legally, your position can't depend

on the fact they were working at General Motors, can it?

22

MR. STRAUSS*

23

QUESTION*

Well, not on the --

I mean, legally, you wouldn't take

2

MR. STRAUSS:

There are two different

principles at stake.

and the other is the mitigation of damages principle.

The Labor Act principle does not depend on their working

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, that's right.

That's

16

right, and to the extent their argument is limited to

17

the Labor Act principle, it is irrelevant, but in answer

18

to the suggestions that Justice Blackmun was making that

19

it is somehow unfair to the employer to say, you can't

20

give them a provisional offer of seniority, I think that

21

would not be unfair because the employee remains under a

22

duty to act reasonably, and if that was a reasonable

23

opportunity to mitigate damages, then the employee

24

should have taken it, even though it was provisional

25

seniority.

think it is some injury to him, the employee, the woman,

You are saying that this was a

to litigate about any injuries you have suffered up

until now, but from now on I am putting you in the

position you say you would have been in if I had not

discriminated against you.

20
21

22

If the employer says that, then he has cut off
the back pay award under the Labor Act principle.
Or, third, he can give the employee an

23

opportunity to mitigate damages, and then the question

24

becomes, does the employee act reasonably in not

25

accepting that offer.

QUESTION*

Suppose there had been no seniority

system at all, and he made the offer, and then the

person was employed at General Motors at what he thought

was a better job, so he just stayed with General Motors,

for back pay at Ford.

All the facts are the same, except no seniority

21

wages, not 1971 wages.

Then it would cut off the

Of course, the job would have to be at 1973

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. STRAUSS:

Oh, yes.

Yes.

I think it is important to keep

24

in mind that we are talking about cutting off a back pay

25

award, reducing back pay below the amount that would be

55
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

needed to make victims of employment discrimination

2

whole, and there has to be some reason for chopping off

3

the award, not just reducing it by the amount of

4

subsequent earnings or subsequent amounts that could

5 have been earned, but chopping off the award at the date
6 of the offer.
7

Now, there is some logic to doing that.

If

8 the offer takes the form of saying, from now on, you
9

will suffer no further the effects of the

10 discrimination, then it makes sense to say, you will
11
12

not —
QUESTION;

Well, you have to allege

13 discrimination, don't you, because at this time it has
14 not been determined whether there was or was not
18 discrimination.
16

MR. STRAUSS:

That's right, but of course the

17 employer is not liable at all for any back pay if he is
18 not found to have discriminated.
19

QUESTION;

But before the determination both

20 parties are kind of looking at their whole card, really.
21
22
23

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, that's right.

That's

right, but in that they are in the same position.
QUESTION:

Why shouldn't the Commission take

24 the position as far as possible consistent with the
25 statute, encourage mitigation of damages, encourage

56
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

employees to cut liability, and encourage settlement?

2

MR. STRAUSS;

We absolutely do all three of

3

those things, and if this had been an unreasonable

4

decision by the employees, if they had been unemployed

5

and had turned down a good job offer, that would be an

6

unreasonable failure to mitigate damages.

7

8

QUESTION*

What is your final answer on the

Chief Justice's question about a provisional offer?

9

MR. STRAUSS*

I think the offer has to be to

10

place — and I think this is the Board rule.

11

has to be to place them in the same position as other

12

employees.

13
14
15

The offer

They can't be under a cloud —
QUESTION*

So the answer is that that kind of

offer would not suffice.
MR. STRAUSS*

That sort of offer would not

16

suffice, although, although they would be in no better

17

position than other employees, and if they proved to be

18

incompetent or unqualified, and that were a ground for

19

dismissal, they could be dismissed subsequently.

20

QUESTION;

Mr. Strauss -- oh, excuse me.

Did

21

you finish your answer?

22

your test in terms of whether it is reasonable from the

23

point of view of the employee, because in the example

24

Justice White gave you, if there were no seniority

25

system at Ford, and they were employed at General

I don't think you can phrase

Motors, and very reasonably decided, well, I don't think.

2

I will take the Ford offer, you agree that would

3

nevertheless cut off their back pay?

4

MR. STRAUSS;

5

QUESTION*

6

Yes, if Ford —

So it does not turn just on the

reasonableness of the employee's decision.

7

MR. STRAUSS*

That is back to the two

8

principles.

9

the mitigation principle.

The Labor Act principle is distinct from
The Labor Act principle says,

10

if you are put in a position such that you will not

11

continue to suffer the effects of the alleged

12

discrimination, that cuts it off no matter how

13

reasonable it was to take that job.

14

separate way the employer can reduce his back pay, and

15

that is by showing that the employee had a reasonable

16

chance to take a job, whether or not that job was

17

identical to the one he would have had had he not been

18

discriminated against and he failed to do that.

19

of those avenues can be used by the employer to reduce

20

back pay.

21

22

QUESTION*

25

Either

Well, we don't need to be bound by

the Labor Board principle, I don't think.

23
24

Then there is a

MR. STRAUSS;

No, that’s right.

In fact,

QUESTION*

And anyway, isn’t that just some

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

discrete application of a mitigation rule?

2

MR. STRAUSS*

Well, it certainly serves the

3

same policies as the mitigation rule, Justice White.

4

The reason I am distinguishing it so sharply is that I

5

think analytically they rest on different foundations,

6

and it is important to see the rationale of the Board

7

rule .

8
9

QUESTION;

Why should the Labor Board rule be

important in this context at all?

10

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, I think it is not obvious

11

that it should.

12

that it should because the remedial provision of Title

13

VII —

14
15

We are, as I said, accepting arguendo

QUESTION;

Well, what if it weren't?

Then how

would we come out in this case?

16

MR. STRAUSS;

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. STRAUSS;

Well, I certainly don't think --

Just on a straight mitigation.
I certainly don't think there is

19

any logical sense in cutting off the back pay award at a

20

date if the employee continues to suffer injury after

21

that date on account of the employer's discrimination.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION;

You certainly would come out

differently on yoar provisional offer.
MR. STRAUSS;

Well, he continues to suffer the

injury of being under the provisional cloud which he

59
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

would not have been under.

2

QUESTION;

Well, I know, but he wouldn't

3

continue to suffer if he won the lawsuit, but if he lost

it, why should he continue to have his seniority that he

didn't deserve in the first place?

Justice's question was the Labor Board rule.

Well, I agree, the provisional --

On a mitigation theory, I can't

imagine —
MR. STRAUSS:

A provisional offer would -- may

15

well suffice to mitigate damages in certain

16

circumstances.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. STRAUSS:

19

QUESTION;

All right.
That is right.

If you admit that, why, this is a

20

provisional offer case, isn't it, because in effect they

21

said, you get the job, and provided you win, you get

22

everything else, too.

23

MR. STRAUSS:

I do think there is a possible

24

mitigation argument in this case.

25

both lower courts found it was reasonable for them to

The problem is that

decline the Ford offer, and it is a reasonableness test.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Hr. Wester, do you have

anything further?

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. WESTER, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

6

HR. WESTER;

I would suggest that the

7

reasonableness analysis employed in the mitigation cases

8

to which Mr. Strauss has referred does not apply to this

9

case, and the reason it does not apply is because the

10

reasonableness analysis in those cases has always come

11

from the context where the courts or the Board were

12

evaluating whether a job other than the one that was the

13

subject of the claim was being offered, and in this

14

case, of course, it was the job that was the subject of

15

the claim that was being offered.

All of the mitigation damages concerned

from the job initially sought.
