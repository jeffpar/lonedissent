ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. MARY ANN BURGESS, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MS. BURGESS;

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
The present case involves a strong public

Ms. Burgess, you may

policy consistently fostered by this Court against

10

interference with state proceedings by federal courts

11

either by way of injunction or declaratory remarks.
The court below declined to follow this policy

12
13

and interfered in an ongoing state bar disciplinary

14

process, thereby inserting itself into the delicate

15 relationship between a

state judiciary and attorney's

16 license to practice before it.
17 provides

this Court with an opportunity to consider the

18 application of the
19 in

policy of noninterference articulated

Younger and amplified by its progeny to attorney

20 disciplinary proceedings, and
21

The case therefore

to firmly establish the

appropriateness of federal noninterference to such

22 proceedings which involve such significant and important
23 state concerns.
24

It must be underscored that what this case

25 does not involve is the constitutionality of particular

disciplinary rules or whether an attorney violated those

2 rules.

What is at stake is whether the State Supreme

3

Court can articulate and develop standards governing

4

attorney discipline and discipline attorneys who have

5

been charged with violating those standards free and

6 unfettered
7

from federal intervention.

However, in order

to fully appreciate the issues that this raises it is

8 necessary to briefly discuss the factual setting in
9

which it arose.
The case has its origin in the criminal trial

10
11

of Joanne Chesimard who was charged with the murder of a

12 New Jersey state trooper.

During the jury selection

13

process in this trial Lennox Hinds, an attorney in New

14

Jersey, called a press conference concerning the conduct

15

of that trial, and more particular, that of the trial

16

judge.

Reports of the press conference --

QUESTION;

19

Had there been any advance — had

there been any advance indication from the judge

20 directing all counsel not to have any public statements?

21

MS. BURGESS;

It is my understanding, Chief

22 Justice, that there was an order of some type directed
23

to the counsel in the case, and I believe that during

24

the press conference Mr. Hinds indicated that he was

25

speaking on behalf of the counsel in the case because

MS. BURGESS;

7
8

He was not himself of counsel , is

He was not of counsel in that

particular trial, yes, Chief Justice.
It was reported in these articles that Mr.

9

10

Hinds had called the proceeding a travesty, had

11

indicated that Judge Appleby, the trial judge, was

12 without

judicial temperament or racial sensitivity to

3

sit as an objective judge in this particular trial.

4

was reported that he called the -- that he accused the

5

judge of asking self-serving questions which was leading

6

to the creation of a hangman's court.

attention of the committee.

and it was

5 widely publicized in the papers.

In order to protect the jury trial that was

8

with the investigation until the trial itself had been

9 concluded.

When it was concluded, the investigation was

Hinds to discuss the matter.

13 Mr.

After several

attempts, the investigation went on without

When it was concluded, Mr.

Ms. Burgess, I wonder if you'd try

17 to speak just a little louder,

MS. BURGESS;

would you?

Certainly.

21

administration of justice; and secondly, that these

22 statements violated

DR 7-107(D)

in that they were made

23 during the jury selection process and were reasonably
24 likely to interfere with a fair trial in that they were
25 intended to influence the taking of prospective jurors.

Sixth Amendment.

In accordance with the recommendations of Mr.

However, instead of

The Third Circuit posits a very novel

and unique relationship between the Supreme Court and

MS. BURGESS;

There has been no decision.

Well, Ms. Burgess, what exactly is

the question before us?

5

the district court should have abstained as of the

it acted, or whether the district court should have

about the situation, because there has been a factual

Is it the question of whether

change.
MS. BURGESS;

11

There has been a factual

12

change.

It was our position that the district court --

13

which it did do, it did abstain from Interfering in the

14

process; that that was a proper act for the district

15

court.

16

felt that was an abuse of discretion.

When it was appealed to the Third Circuit, they

We petitioned for a rehearing.

17

It was at that

18

point that the State Supreme Court indicated its

19

willingness, being apprised of this particular matter,

20 that it would hear the constitutional claims of Lennox
21

22

Hinds.
We apprised the Third Circuit in our petition

23

for rehearing of that fact.

The Third Circuit said that

24

what was of importance was the factual situation at the

25

time the complaint arose, not as of the time that they

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

were reviewing it at that point, which was about a

2 two-year lapse.

So they felt that when the complaint

Kinds could not have an adjudication of

4 his constitutional

rights before the Ethics Committee.

5 They refused to vacate or reconsider their decision

6 because even though the matter was now fully before the
7 Supreme Court — and
8

I don't think there's any question

that Mr. Hinds has ample opportunity to have his

9 constitutional claims adjudicated

by that body, which

10

certainly constitutes a competent tribunal to adjudicate

11

these constitutional -- federal constitutional claims.
QUESTIONS

Do I correctly understand that the

13 Third Circuit is not interfering with the ongoing
14 consideration by the New Jersey

In its decision, sir, petition

they indicated they had no trouble or

with concurrent proceedings, one in the District

18 Court, one before

the New Jersey Supreme Court, which

19 it's our view runs seriously counter
20 comity and federalism;
21

to the notions of

that it is quite possible that in

this duplicitous, duplicative process that the Supreme

22 Court of New Jersey will come to one conclusion on the
23 constitutionality in its adjudication of those issues,
24 and

let’s assume Mr. Hinds is not satisfied with that,

25 rather than

bringing that final determination of the

ability of the Supreme Court of New Jersey to

QUESTION;

Ms. Burgess, excuse me.

15 stay close to those microphones?

Would you

We’re having

16 difficulty hearing you.
17

MS. BURGESS;

I'm sorry.

18

It is not, in effect, precluding the Supreme

19 Court at this point from adjudicating those claims.

The

20 possibility is that the federal district court will be
21

reviewing that final determination or will be reviewing

22 those issues and reaching a contrary result if Mr.

Hinds

23 is dissatisfied with the results in the New Jersey
24 Supreme Court.
25

QUESTION;

May I ask one other question?

If

federal action had not been filed

2 as I understand you, only major matters get to the New

Court, and I don't know whether this is a

4 major matter within the meaning of that test or not.

Is there a strong likelihood that had the

5

6 federal

suit not been filed, this case never would have

7 reached the

Supreme Court of New Jersey?

MS. BURGESS*

With regard to the imposition of

the major matters

10 would get to the Supreme Court where there

There has been a history in our court of a

20 very flexible procedure with regard to attorney

So that while a matter is pending

22 before an Ethics Committee there can be motions made to

Suprema Court to resolve procedural issues or

Let me take you back to the nature

In this Court, as you know, both in

And so that's precisely why the Court of

19

Appeals for the Third Circuit said that at this

20

particular juncture the district Ethics Committee was

21 functioning purely in the

prosecutive level.

22

May I point out, Mr. Chief Justice, that when

23

you asked the question with respect to a master, when a

24

master is appointed, the court appointing the master has

25

made a judicial determination that the issue that is

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

presented requires fact-finding; and there has been some

2 preliminary

judicial determination as to the legal

3 questions, as to the constitutional questions.

Here, nothing happened other than David Foley

4

5 said I*d like to investigate, and the committee said you
6 can investigate.

Nothing further happened other than

7 that, and we're in the process at this particular point
8 where we go into court where the consequence of them
9 going ahead is there may or may not be a prosecution.

Now, that's not the point at which abstention

10
11

applies.

That's not the point at which Younger

12 abstention applies.

In fact, so far as I know, there's

13 case after case after case in this Court which says that
14 prosecutors — I'm thinking of Consumers Union —
15 prosecutors are natural objects of injunctive and
16 declaratory relief, and the Younger abstention doesn't
17 apply.

I'm thinking of Steffel against Thompson, an

18 opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan.

I'm thinking of the

19 Doran case, an opinion by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

Down the line, before there has been a
prosecutive determination, before the matter has been

which hasn’t been mentioned as yet which I think is

The plaintiffs in this case in the district

These three

and we want the freedom to address ourselves in that

Now, whatever the Supreme Court of New Jersey

13

14 may do with
15

respect to Lennox Hinds, that doesn’t affect

the standing of these bar associations to object to

16 these rules

on their face and as applied.

Now, if, to pick up Mr. Justice Marshall’s

MR. STAVIS;

But not doing that, I think that you should

Let me point out something to you.

Some years

the case called American Trial Lawyers

9 Association against the New Jersey Supreme Court.

And

10

of course all New Jersey lawyers are very familiar with

11

that case because it had something to do with something

12 very dear to

their hearts, namely the fees that they

13 were authorized to charge.

And you insisted in that case in reversing,

2 well.

But I do not believe that at this juncture this

3

Court can determine the facts as they're developed

4

subsequently.
And certainly, Justice White, the Court of

5

6 Appeals said
7

that on remand the district court would

have to consider the separate interests of the

8 organizations, which --

22

And whether or

New Jersey may have

with respect to Lennox Hinds remains to be seen.
Let me point out to you a very real

23

possibility.

A very real possibility is for the Supreme

24

Court of New Jersey to say several things.

25

that obviously Lennox Hinds wasn't counsel in the case;

It could say

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

this issue,

this matter shouldn't have been prosecuted

2 because he wasn't counsel, and
3

that's the end of it.

The Court of Appeals -- the Supreme Court of

4

New Jersey could decide that Rule 8102, which is a rule

5

that specifically deals with criticism of judges, should

6 have been the rule applicable instead of DR 7-107.
7

Well, supposing it decides that.

Then the

8 organizations come along and say but the court hasn't
9

adjudicated the question of the facial

10 unconstitutionality of the statute.
11

And that's an issue

which remains and an issue which we as three black

12 organizations are very seriously concerned about.
13
14
15

QUESTION;

Well, you'd have to show separate

standing in that case, though.
HR. STAVIS;

Well, yes.

And the Court of

16 Appeals expressly pointed out that there wasn't a record
17

upon which it could decide that particular question.

18

I'm referring particularly to the Doran case.

19

wasn't a kind of record at which you could determine

20 whether or not there was a

that's an issue that will have to be returned to the

more record on that than the Court of Appeals for the
