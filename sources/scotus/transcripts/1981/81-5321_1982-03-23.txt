ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. LIEBMAN;

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court, Petitioner, Earl Enmund, has been
10 sentenced by the state of Florida to be executed for the

11 crime of murder.
12 Florida

Now, two factual determinations of the

Supreme Court surrounding Mr. Enmund's actual

13 involvement in

that crime are critical here, and I would

14 like to take a moment to summarize those findings.

First, the Florida Supreme Court determined

15

16 that Earl Enmund did not himself take life.
17 determined that Sampson
18 confederate in
19 that is,

Armstrong, Mr. Enmund's

a robbery, killed both of the victims,

Mr. Thomas Kersey and Mrs. Eunice Kersey, in an

20 exchange of
21

Rather, it

gunfire that was initiated by Mrs. Kersey.

The Florida Supreme Court determined that during these

22 events and during the robbery, Petitioner was not on the
23 scene but was 200 yards away in
24

the get-away car.

More importantly, the Florida Supreme Court

25 secondly expressly determined that the killings

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 committed by Sampson Armstrong were not intended or
2 contemplated as a part of the robbery scheme with which
3 Mr. Enmund had associated himself and had helped plan.
4 Rather, the Florida Supreme Court, in its own words,
5 determined that those killings by Sampson Armstrong
6 "were spontaneous and were precipitated by the armed
7 resistance of Mrs. Kersey," again, at a time when Earl
8 Enmund was 200 yards away, and was not at all able to
g take any part in that spontaneous decision by Sampson
10 Armstrong to. return Mrs. Kersey’s fire.
11

QUESTION*

Does the record show whether when

12 they entered -- embarked on this enterprise, Enmund was
13 aware that his friend had a gun?
14

MR. LIEBMANs

No, Your Honor.

The evidence on

15 the gun is -- on the guns is extremely confused.

In

16 fact, the prosecutor told the jury both in the opening
17 argument and in the closing argument that it was not
13 going to be able to tell
19 even how

many guns there were.

20 Now, all we know is that
21 Mrs. Kersey had a gun.
22

them anything about the guns or

QUESTION*

They didn’t know that.

Sampson Armstrong had a gun and
Beyond that —

On the ballistics tests, how many

23 different guns were indicated?
24

MR. LIEBMANs

Two, at least two.

There were

25 some bullets that they did not trace to either gun, but

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 they couldn't tell whether they were from those guns or
2 others.
3

They just couldn’t do a ballistics test.
QUESTION;

And how many people involved in the

4 enterprise?
5

NR. HERMAN:

Well, that is unclear also, but

6 there were at least Sampson Armstrong, Jeanette
7 Armstrong and Earl Enmund, and possibly Ida Jean Shaw,
8 and then there was Mr. and Mrs. Kersey at the scene.
9 One other fact that I should mention is that Sampson
10 Armstrong told J.B. Neil, his friend, who testified at
11 trial against Sampson, that both Sampson and Jeanette
12 Armstrong had guns.
13

QUESTION:

Is there a reasonable inference

14 that there were three different firearms involved here?
15

MR. LIEBMAN:

Well, there’s a reasonable

16 inference that there were at least two.

I think the

17 state’s statement to the jury that it couldn’t —
18

QUESTION:

I thought you just said that there

19 were two that they could identify and one they couldn’t
20 identify.
21

That makes three.
MR. LIEBMAN:

22 if I said that.

No.

No, Your Honor.

I misspoke

There were two that they could

23 identify, and all of the other bullets could have come
24 from one of those two guns.

They just couldn't

25 determine it, because those bullets were too injured to

QUESTION;

3

bodies?
HR. LIEBMAN;

4
5

How many bullets were put in the

Mr. Kersey was shot twice.

Kersey was shot six times.

Mrs.

They found a total of nine

6 bullets, those eight plus an additional ninth bullet,
7

but they could only do successful ballistics tests on

8 five of the bullets.
9

Now, in order to affirm Petitioner's

10

conviction of first degree murder on those findings that

11

I just mentioned, the Florida Supreme Court found it

12

necessary and said that it found it necessary to rely on

13

two what it has called in the past constructive devices,

14

and to establish murder, the court first relied on

15

Florida's constructive malice doctrine.

16

doctrine, a person who is engaged in a robbery who Kills

17

is conclusively presumed, despite any other evidence, to

18

be — to have intended that death, and thus to be a

19

murderer.

20
21

Under that

The court then applied Florida's accessorial
rule under which all of the robbery confederates who are

22 either actually or, as the Florida Supreme Court
23

determined was actually the case here, are only

24

constructively present at the time the Killings took

25

place are also conclusively presumed to have an intent

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to kill, and thersfore to be murderers.
2

Now, I want to stress that under the Florida

3 rule, including, and this is stated in the Pope case
4 which is cited repeatedly by the Supreme Court in
5 affirming Petitioner's conviction, and also the Hampton
6 case, and both of those cases are cited on Page 13 of
7 our opening brief, the Florida courts have clearly held
8 that in a case in which the jury would find that there
9 is no foreseeability that the deaths would occur, that
10 there was no contemplation by the accomplices of any
11 possible death, even in that kind of a case, Florida's
12 felony murder rule and its accessorial rules apply.
13

Now, in this record, Mr. Enmund's principal

14 submission, which we have set out in Point 1 of our
15 opening brief, is that execution is an excessive and
16 disproportionate punishment, in violation of the Eighth
17 and Fourteenth Amendments, for one who did not himself
18 take

life, attempt or assist in taking life, and for one

19 who did not intend that life be taken by another.
20

Now, at the outset I want to make very clear

21 that Petitioner's submission here does not in any way
22 challenge Florida's authority to devise rules governing
23 accessorial liability or its ability to define the crime
24 of felony murder or to punish those crimes severely, but
25 Petitioner's first submission does raise the single

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

question of the constitutionality of inflicting the one

2 punishment, the unique punishment of death on one who
3 has not taken part in a design himself to take life or
4 to have it taken by another.
5

And we believe that the answer to that

6 question, that death is a disproportionate punishment in
7 that situation, is mandated by this Court’s prior
8 decision, the logic of its decision in Coker versus
9 Georgia.

In Coker, the Court decided a question that

10 Gregg versus Georgia had left open, and
11 there are certain crimes short

12 committed by the defendant that

that was whether

of deliberate homocide
the Eighth Amendment

13 prohibits the states from punishing by death, and
14 indeed,

the Court determined in Coker that Ehrlich Coker

15 could not constitutionally be executed for the serious,
16 in fact, the often life-threatening crime of rape, even
17 where that crime in that particular case had been
18 carried out in part by the offender holding a knife to
19 the victim’s throat during the rape.
20

Wow, the crucial point I want to make here is

21 that in condemning Earl Enmuni to death, the state of
22 Florida has proved nothing more on his part than a
23 degree of participation in the crime of robbery that is
24 identical to Ehrlich Coker’s degree of participation in
25 the crime of rape.

Insofar as anything the two men did

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 or intended or even foresaw, they are the same.
2

Now, here it is true that two deaths occurred,

3 but I want to stress, I think, it is important for
4 purposes of Eighth Amendment decision-making here that
5 that was at the hands and at the decision of Sampson
6 Armstrong, and as the Florida Supreme Court expressly

7 determined,

that was not by any design or act on Earl

8 Enmund's part, apart from being himself a part of the

g robbery, and therefore the Florida Supreme Court, the
10 Florida courts all the way along, the instructions, in
11 order to link Mr. Enmund to those deaths, they could not
12 rely on anything he did or intended, and they did not
13 purport to.

Rather, they linked him to those deaths

14 solely by virtue of the constructive malice and
15 constructive presence devices.

Those are the only

16 links, and those are the links that the Florida Supreme
17 Court expressly relied on.
18

QUESTIONi

You say it would be irrational for

19 reasonable jurors to have concluded that everybody
20 involved in that automobile knew about the number of
21 guns that were present and who had them?
22

MR. LIEBMANi

Well, the first point, Your

23 Honor, is that on the instructions given here, the jury
24 was not asked to confront that point and made no finding
25 on it, and the —

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

My question didn't go to that.

2 Suppose — Jurors often conclude things which are not

3 covered by instructions, and they are permitted to do
4 so.

Would it be irrational or unreasonable for a juror

5 to conclude that everyone in that car knew that1 this was
6 an armed enterprise?

MR. LIEBMAN:

7

I think, Your Honor, that on the

8 proof that we have in this case,

that would be a

9 difficult inference for the jury to draw.
10 if
11

I don't know

I can say it would be an irrational inference, but it

would be extremely difficult, because the only time the

12 state actually connected Mr.

Enmund to those guns was

13 two days later, when he participated in a plan with
14 Sampson Armstrong and Ida Jean Shaw to dispose of the
15 wea pons.
16

Now, we know something about the calibers.

We

17 know that there was a .22-caliber gun, and that that
18 belonged to Ida Jean Shaw.
19 and said it was her gun.

She disposed of that weapon
She also said that the

20 .38-caliber weapon that she disposed of was one that she
21 had seen in

the hands of either Sampson Armstrong or

22 Jeanette Armstrong some time before these events

23 occurred.

So, all of the evidence is at least

24 consistent, with the possibility that those guns were on
25 the persons only of the Armstrongs and Mrs. Kersey, and

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that Petitioner didn’t know, and of course the jury here

2 was instructed that if there are two possible inferences
3 that it can
4 strong,
5 defense,

draw from the evidence, you know, equally

then it must draw the inference in favor of the
and I would suggest that that instruction here

6 would make it quite difficult for the jury to determine
7 that Earl Enmund knew something about the guns.

But, of course, in any event, the jury was not

8
9

asked here to make any determination about the guns.

10 The state said it couldn't really prove very much about
11 the guns, and it just didn’t have to, because the felony
12 murder rule
13 have to
14

that it was acting under allowed it not to

prove that sort of thing.
And I want to stress that for purposes of

15 criminal liability and for
16 punishment,
17 and

purposes of severe

I have no doubt that these vicarious devices

these conclusive presumptions that the Florida

18 Supreme Court relied upon ate perfectly okay to
19 establish a nexus betwee what the offender actually did

20 and these killings, but here the punishment is death,
21 and in that qualitatively different situation,

the

22 Eighth Amendment implies it requires that the courts
23 apply qualitatively different standards.
24

And in particular, as this Court stated so

25 recently in

Eddings versus Oklahoma, what the Eighth

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Amendment requires in death penalty cases is a

2 sensibility to the uniqueness of the individual

3 offender.

What this Court repeatedly has called in

4 Woodson, Roberts, Lockett, a concern, a concern for the
5 individual culpability of that offender for his
6 particular offense,

and for his particular character,

7 and what we suggest here is that that crucial Eighth
8 Amendment concern in death penalty cases for individual

9 culpability simply will not permit the gap between what
10 Earl Enmund

11 and

actually did and intended here as a robbery

the Kerseys' deaths at the hands of Sampson

12 Armstrong to be bridged by nothing more than what is

13 really a legal fiction.
14

In short, the Eighth Amendment requires that

15 actual individual culpability be the touchstone of how
16 we determine who lives and who dies.
17

2UESTI0NJ

Well, is it a legal fiction or is

18 it an irrebuttable presumption that a participant in a
19 felony which results in death has that consequence?

You

20 call it a legal fiction.
21

HR. LIEBMAN:

Well, let me explain why I call

22 it that, because I did carefully use those terms.

The

23 Florida Supreme Court has stated that even in a case
24 where it is in fact provable and the defendant could
25 prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not intend

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

death, that he did not know that there was any

2 reasonable likelihood of death,

that no death was

3 contemplated, even in that situation, the felony murder
4 presumption, conclusive presumption of malice applies,
5 and in that case, where the defendant could make that
6 proof,

it has to be a fiction, because the jury could be

7 convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no
8 intent, there was no malice, and yet they would be
9 forced to find malice.

QUESTION:

10

Well, isn't it in fact something a

11 little different from a fiction,
12 state involved that

just a judgment by the

if you participate in a robbery, and

13 because a robbery is sufficiently likely to lead to a
14 fatal killing,

that you are going to be held accountable

15 for the killing, too, without regard to your intent as
16 to kill?
17

MR. LIEBKAN:

Well, Your Honor, that's why I

18 say that that type of reasoning is okay.

There is no

19 constitutional wrong there so far as finding criminal
20 liability or even punishing the person with a severe
21

term of years, but where the problem comes in with that

22 is in the Eighth Amendment area, where the death penalty
23 is involved, because there individual culpability must
24 be crucial,

and we can’t just say that because in most

25 cases this would be true, we are going to presume that

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it is true in all cases.
QUESTION;

2

Yes, but I think the argument is

3

aided by stripping away whatever there is of a fiction,

4

and just looking at the, you know, what facts the state

5

has proved and what reasons are traditionally held out

6 for the felony murder doctrine.

MR. LIEBMAN;

7

That's true, but the reasons

8 that are held out, what I am suggesting is that those
9

reasons in the Eighth Amendment area, where the death

10

penalty is imposed, is inconsistent with the requirement

11

of focusing on individual culpability in determining who

12 lives and who dies.

Now, to take your example, Ehrlich Coker went

13
14

into a rape.

He held a knife to the victim's throat.

15

He committed a crime for which death was a foreseeable

16

result.

17

death was a foreseeable result, and Georgia argued

18

because of that that that was a crime that serious harm

19

or death was so likely that they should be able to

There is no question on the facts of Coker that

20 punish it severely, as if death had occurred, and this
21

22
23

Court —
QUESTION;

Mr. Liebman, in this case he is

guilty of murder, in your book.

24

MR. LIEBMAN;

25

QUESTION;

He is guilty of murder.

And he has to be sentenced to

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

something, right?

2

MR. LIEBMANi

3

QUESTION!

4

MR. LIEBMANi

That is correct. Your Honor.

You are not saying, turn him loose.

No, and I want to make that

5 clear over and over again.
2UESTI0N:

6

Hell, that's what I -- I don't

7 think you have quite -- Exactly what is your position in
8 this case?

What should this man have been sentenced to,

9 in your opinion?
10
11

MR. LIEBMANi

The punishment for felony murder

in Florida, where there is no death penalty, is life in

12 prison without possibility of parole for 25 years.

Mr.

13 Enmund is at this point —
14

QUESTION;

Wait a minute.

You said life

15 imprisonment for 25 years?
16

MR. LIEBMANi

It is life in prison without

17 possibility of parole for 25 years.
18

QUESTION;

I see.

19

MR. LIEBMANi

I see.

After 25 years, the parole board

20 then can exercise its discretion.
21

And for purposes of

that punishment or even a mandatory life sentence

22 without possibility of any parole —

23

QUESTION!

Right.

24

MR. LIEBMANi

— there would be no

25 constitutional problem with what has happened here.

I

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

think that the Woodson case makes it quite clear that

2 while we have no problem with mandatory sentences,
3 mandatory severe sentences where the death

penalty is

4 not involved; where the death penalty is involved, we
5 have a different issue, and what I am arguing here is
6 that where you have that different issue, and the
7 crucial part of that different issue is individual
8 culpability,

when we are separating who lives and who

9 dies, we must look at the individual culpability of the
10 offender.

11

And when we look at the individual culpability

12 of Earl Enmund and

Ehrlich Coker, it is

13 indistinguishable.

The two culpabilities of the two men

14 are indistinguishable,

and therefore on this individual

15 culpability measure the Eighth Amendment simply cannot
16 rationally be seen as tolerating Mr. Enmund’s sentence
17 of death at

the same time as it conclusively and for all

18 cases says that Mr. Coker cannot be punished by death.
19

QUESTION;

Well, in Coker's case, nobody died,

20 and here someone did die as a result of the enterprise
21 with which Enmund was connected.

22

MR. LIEBMAN;

23 you are assuming,

Well, first of all, Your Honor,

I think, by that statement that there

24 was a but for connection between Mr. Enmund and the
25 death,

and even that has not been proved as a matter of

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Florida law.

All you need to do is prove that he took

2 part in a robbery, and that a death occurred as part of
3 that robbery.
4 Hr.

But there is no proof here -- They left

Enmund out at the car.

He knew the Kerseys, so they

5 left him out at the car, because he could be identified,
6 but there is no proof here that they wouldn’t have left
7 him at home and gone ahead and done it if he didn’t go
8 along.

9

So that even on that assumption you don't have

10 that proof here,
11

but I would suggest that the death is

not — it cannot be enough.

Otherwise, if we had — we

12 could have the death penalty for negligent vehicular
13 homocide, or for a person who jaywalks negligently,
14 steps out in front of a car, the car swerves to avoid
15 him, and there is a death.

There is a causation.

There

16 is a criminal violation by jaywalking, and there is a
17 death there,

but I would suggest that the death penalty

18 simply would be — would be too extreme a penalty for
19 that crime.
20

What this case — this Court’s cases have

21 looked at very clearly is not the disembodied injury,

22 but the injury caused by the design of the offender.
23 looks to the connection between

It

the offender's design,

24 his acts that he took in furtherance of that design, and
25 the harm that results,

and what I am suggesting here is

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that the connection between the design with which
2 Petitioner took place, that is, a design to commit a
3 robbery, the connection between that and the killings is
4 purely by virtue of these constructive malice devices.
5 The Florida Supreme Court had nothing else to go on, and
6 in that sense there is no difference between Ehrlich

7 Coker, who did everything that Earl Enmund did, but
8 there was no death resulting at the hands or by the

9 decision of somebody else, but in terms of individual
10 culpability, Ehrlich Coker did everything, thought
11 everything, foresaw everything that Earl Enmund did, and
12 if the Constitution — if the Eighth Amendment with its
13 crucial focusing on individual culpability, says that
14 Hr. Coker falls below the line and cannot be
15 constitutionally —
16
17

QUESTION:

Are you doing to get around to

suggesting what culpability means?

18

HH. LIEBMAN:

19

QUESTION;

20

HE. LIEBMAN:

21

QUESTION;

22

HR. LIEBMAN:

Well, Your Honor, I think that —

Or do you want to -I would be glad to.

All right.
In our submission, the

23

culpability that should be the determining factor is the

24

intent to take life, conscious purpose to take life as

25

you defined it in your concurring decision in Lockett.

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

25

that I say that, it is not only my reading of the

20

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (702\ 554-2345

1

record, but as I read the Florida Supreme Court

2 decision,

they looked into the question of intent, they

3 looked into the question on this record of the design
4 with which Hr. Enmund had taken part, because intent was
5 relevant at various points of their analysis.
6

QUESTION:

Yes.

7

HR. LIEBMANs

Yes.

And what they said was,

8 repeatedly, he involved himself in a design to rob, and

9 they used those terms several times, 49 through 50 of
10 the Appendix, and they determined
11

that the deaths that

occurred occurred spontaneously at Sampson Armstrong's

12 decision.

Now, I am not saying that as to Sampson

13 Armstrong that you couldn't say that there was an
14 intent, but they occurred spontaneously at a time when
15 Earl Enmund was no more part of the enterprise, and
16 therefore, because the intent to kill or whatever state
17 of mind there was arose at that time, when Earl Enmund
18 was no more on the scene and couldn't have participated
19 in it, for that reason, I think it would be a very
20 difficult proposition,

to find intent, when I think the

21 Florida Supreme Court, looking at the record, has said

22 that there is no intent.

because the jury would have thereby decided that this

18 Enmund was arrested for possession of a concealed

20 felon.

Earl Enmund, in an attempt to alibi his

.38 caliber pistol

23 for defense two or three days after the murders.

In any event, the Florida Supreme Court has

2

3 answered that question I presented in the affirmative,
4 and I think that based upon common sense and legal
5 precedent, this Court must do the same.

The Court

6 should refuse to read an absolute intent requirement
7 into the Eigtht Amendment of the United States
8 Constitution.

This issue has not precisely been decided by

10 this Court before, I realize that, or we wouldn’t be

11 here.

However, the Court has provided general

12 constitutional guidelines.

Florida's legislative determination

The record before

16 the Court presents a good case where the state courts’
17 factual determinations must be accepted.
18

Now, in the Florida Supreme Court, Petitioner

19 argued this point, and I quote, "Absence of direct proof
20 that the defendant intended to cause the death of the
21 victim is highly relevant in determining the appropriate
22 penalty."

Highly relevant.

We don’t contest that.

23 Now, however, Petitioner is claiming that absence of
24 proof of actual intent to kill should be an absolute
25 constitutional bar to the imposition of the death

2

He is asking too much from the Constitution.
Florida's position, as was reiterated in our

3 brief numerous times, is that the Court should refrain
4 from drawing a bright line in a case like this in an
5 area which has traditionally been left to the state
6 legislatures.

Now, Petitioner counters with the fact

7 that, well, death is different.

The legislature

8 shouldn’t be allowed to control this.
9

Yes, death is different, but it's different

10 for the innocent victims as well as the defendant, and

is where the

18

QUESTION;

Well, would you say that the death

19 penalty ought to be available under our cases in a case
20 of negligent homocide?
21

MR. KADEN;

Of course not, Your Honor, but I

22 think that is a legislative determination, not a
23 judicial one.
24

QUESTION;

So you would say if the Florida

25 legislature provides the death penalty for negligent

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 homocide, there would be nothing that any federal court
2 could do about it.
3

HR. KADENi

If it complied — if their

4 legislative determination complied with all the factors
5 previously enunciated by this Court, with the
6 aggravating factors and the mitigating circumstances and
7 the weighing process.

I doubt that could be done, but

8 the legislature does have the authority to do that.
9

2UESTI0M;

So you say that death is both —

10 the occurrence of the victim's death is both, in effect,
11 a necessary and a sufficient basis for imposing the
12 death penalty.
13

MR. KADEN;

After Coker, Your Honor.

14

Now, the Florida legislature has constructed a

15 statutory framework for imposing death sentences which
16 complies with all this Court's previous opinions.

the individual, the defendant, and he makes — the jury

the rationale behind Coker is

Several of the members of this

Intent should be just a factor.

The first part of the test was

15 whether a particular punishment contributed to the
16 acceptable goals of punishment as recognized by
17 society.

The first part that needs to be discussed is

18 deterrence .
19

Now, Petitioner has argued that one who does

20 not intend death can't be deterred.

He can't be

21 deterred from what he didn't intend to commit.
22

Petitioner has missed the point.

The intent and recklessness is presumed if the

Next, I would like to discuss Petitioner's

3 argument that the Florida Supreme Court has eliminated
4 the death sentence in cases like this.

Petitioner has

5 cited, oh, eight or ten cases at the conclusion of his
6 brief, but what Petitioner fails to tell this Court is
7 that those cases all involved jury recommendations of
8 life sentences which the trial court overruled and the
9 Florida Supreme Court rejected.

Petitioner's jury

10 recommended a death sentence.

11

Petitioner's second argument in his brief was

12 that this record cannot support his death sentence.
13 This argument should not be persuasive.

The trial court

14 specifically found, and the Florida Supreme Court upheld
15 this finding, that Earl Enmund's involvement was major,
18 not minor, as Earl Enmund would have you believe.
17 for

But

Earl Enmund, these murders would not have occurred.

18 The jury, the trial court, and the Florida Supreme Court
19 all agreed that death was the appropriate sentence for
20 Petitioner.

This decision was reached after they

21 considered the unique circumstances of Earl Enmund's
22 character and the individual circumstances of the crimes.
23

QUESTION*

Mr. Kaden, may I interrupt you with

The trial judge found, I believe, that the

25 defendant Enmund and the defendant Sampson Armstrong

Now,

3
4
5

How does that affect the sentencing process?
MR. KADENi

It doesn't affect it at all in

this case because there were two valid, unchallenged

6 aggravating circumstances, no mitigating circumstances.
7

When there -- Under Florida law, when there is one

8 aggravating circumstance, no mitigating circumstance,
9

death is presumed.

If the Florida Supreme Court made

10

any mistakes at all in this case, it would be throwing

11

out that factual finding by the trial court.

12

The trial court was aware from the trial that

13

Jeanette Armstrong, who had gone up to the murder scene,

14

was seriously wounded.

15

that she blacked out.

16

victims’ bodies had two different types of bullets found

17

in them, the trial court took the reasonable inference

18

that Earl Enmund had either left the car or never been

19

in the car and gone up and done the shooting.

20
21

QUESTION*

There is evidence in the record
Because of the fact that the

Well, if the trial court made that

finding, and then also said that the defendant’s

22 participation was major, was the finding that his
23

participation was major based on the belief that he had

fired the shot?

25

MR. KADEN:

No, that was based on the entire

43

1

record.
QUESTION:

2

And what do we do when the

3

appellate court throws it out?

4

SR. KADEN:

5

That was based on the entire

record, which showed that he was the one who originated

6 the plan, he planned the thing, he was seen driving in
7

the car out there, seen driving back.

He covered it up

8 by directing that Ida Jean Shaw dispose of the murder
9
10

weapons.

His involvement was major.

That factual

determination must be accepted by this Court.

11

What the Florida Supreme Court didn't say, and

12

it was not brought out by the state, although this is in

13

the record, Willie Lee testified that early on the

14

morning of the murders, he observed the vehicle which

15

was seen in front of the house, he observed it drive by

16

his place where he was standing waiting for a ride.

17

Inside the car, he testified that absolute — excuse me,

18

he testified that Ida Jean Shaw was driving, Earl Enmund

19

was in the passenger seat, that there were two

20 unidentified blacks in the back of the car, a male and a
21

22

female, two young blacks.
He testified that he was still waiting for his

23

-- the same ride when the vehicle returned.

This time,

24

Earl Enmuni was driving at a reckless rate of speed, Ida

25

Jean Shaw was in the passenger seat, and one of the

Okay.

You might ask what relevance does that have.
Another witness testified that she saw a

6 black male in the car out in front of the victim’s
7 residence.

However, another witness testified that the

8 person in the car that he saw -- this is Robert Davis.
9 He testified on cross examination that the person he saw
10 had long hair.

Earl Enmund is bald.

11 court couli take notice of that.

I think the trial

That is not in the

12 record.
13

Therefore, the only reasonable inference which

14 the trial court can make was that Earl Enmund was not in
15 that car, since the person who was seen in the car had
16 long hair.

That is in Robert Davis’s testimony, and

17 that wasn’t discussed by the Florida Supreme Court.

I

18' don ’ t know why.
ig

Finally, Florida disagrees with Petitioner's

20 assertion that he presented evidence in mitigation in
21 this case.

The record is clear that he did not.

22 Petitioner’s attorney did make a brief statement in his
23 closing argument concerning Earl Enmund's involvement,
24 but in Florida as well as probably most of the other
25 states, what an attorney says is not evidence.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGES*

Do you have anything

7 further, Mr. Liebman?
8

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES S. LIEBMAN, ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

10

MR. LIEBMAN*

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

To begin with, I was rather startled that Mr.

12 Kaden argued or appeared to be arguing that

Earl Enmund

13 was inside that house, and that the trial court made the
14 correct finding on that.

In the Supreme Court of

15 Florida, the state of Florida took the following
16 position about the facts of Mr. Enmund's participation
17 in the case.

I am reading from their brief on appeal at

18 Page 33*
19

"Appellant Enmund in this case, being

20 constructively present some 200 yards away and aiding in
21 the escape,

was therefore a second degree principal, and

22 therefore guilty under Florida’s felony murder rule."

23

They argued there and they took the position

24 that the facts were only enough to support exactly what
25 the Florida Supreme Court found, that he wasn't at the

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 house, that he was 200 yards away, and I just think, that
2 if the Court reviews the record, it will see that the
3 Florida Supreme Court, whose findings are do respect, as
4 this Court held, for example, in Sumner v. Mada so
5 recently, that those findings are absolutely correct on
6 the record, and the state took that position in the
7 Florida Supreme Court.
8

Now, turning to Justice O'Connor's argument or

9 question during my opponent's argument, I would like to
10 refer the Court to Page 55 of the Joint Appendix, the
11 tan Appendix.

On that page, the Florida Supreme Court

12 finds that two of the four aggravating circumstances
13 that the trial court had found were not present in the
14 case, and then it cites the Elledge case in the middle.
15 The Elledge case is the Florida rule that if there are
16 any aggravating circumstances that are rejected and
17 there is any mitigating evidence, any mitigating
18 circumstance at all, then you have to remand for
19 resentencing.
20

And what did the Florida Supreme Court say,

21 having wiped out two of the aggravating circumstances in
22 the case and then applying the Elledge rule?

It said,

23 and I am quoting, and this is from the very last two
24 sentences on the page, "The finding" — it's referring
25 to the trial court's finding — "The finding that no

48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 mitigating circumstances were present was not error.
2 Therefore, the sentence of death is appropriate, and we
3 approve it.”
4

They found not that there was some mitigating

5 circumstances or whatever, they found that there were no

6 mitigating circumstances.

They say it no less than

7 three times on that page.
8

Sandra Lockett helped plan the murder in the

9 Lockett case.

She pointed out the store, the pawn shop

10 that was robbed.

Sandra Lockett hid a gun from the

11 police while the police were searching a taxicab she was
12 in.

Sandra Lockett hid two of her cohorts in the attic

13 when the police were searching her house.
14 Court held,

And yet this

and even in Justice Blackmun's more narrow

15 rule in the Lockett case, that the lack of involvement
16 in the homocide, and I am quoting Justice Blackmun’s

17 opinion there, it's "involvement in the homocide was a
18 mitigating circumstance that if no other circumstance
19 was considered had to be considered."

20

And here, I think, in black and white, at

21 least three different occasions on Page 55, the court
22 has said that there were no mitigating circumstances,
23 that it did not consider those.
24

Moving to a question that Your Honor, Chief

25 Justice asked --

MR. LIEBMAN;

5 but —

MR. LIEBMAN:

No, as I — Your Honor, as I

13 understand the Florida rule, it is not mitigating
14 circumstances within the statute, but mitigating
15 circumstances.

But in any case, for the Court to turn

16 dire consequences on whether there are mitigating
17 circumstances but they are

statutory or non-statutory, I

18 think, would also violate the principle in Lockett that
19 all of these mitigating circumstances have to be

20 considered, but I would also point out that what the
21 trial court

found, and I believe that this is on Page

22 34, if I am not — well, it's on Page 28.
