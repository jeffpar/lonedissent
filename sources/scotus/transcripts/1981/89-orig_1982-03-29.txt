ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE S. FLUSHMAN, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

9

MR. FLUSHMANi

Chief Justice Burger, and may

10 it please the Court, this choice of law case arises
11 under the original jurisdiction of this Court.
12 California was granted leave to file a complaint seeking
13 to acquire title to certain coastal lands which under
14 undisputed California law belong to the state.

The

15 matter is now before the Court on California’s motion
16 for summary judgment and the United States cross-motion
17 for a judgment on the pleadings.
18

At its heart, this case concerns the federal

19 system defining the relationship between the state and
20 national sovereign.

The issue is whether the United

21 States can interfere with fundamental state soveriegn
22 attributes long recognized by this Court that state law
23 decides conflicts over state sovereign lands.

Here, if

24 the United States were not the upland owner, it would be
25 unquestioned but that California would own the disputed

3

1

land.

The result should not differ merely because the

2 United States is that owner.

The facts are few and are not contested.

3
4

Before the late 1880’s, the disputed land lay north of

5

the entrance channel to Humboldt Bay, California, and

6 below the ordinary high water mark along the Coast Guard
7

site.

In the late 1880’s, two rubble mound jetties were

8 built to stabilize this entrance channel by the Army

9 Corps of Engineers.

Most particularly concerned is the

10

north jetty, which according to an undisputed government

11

report, formed a barrier to the down-coast drift of sand

12 suspended in the ocean.

As a result, the shoreline along the Coast

13
14

Guard site moved seaward almost two-thirds of a mile at

15

the jetty.

16

entrance with maps after the jetties were built shows

17

the progressive, dramatic boundary changes.

18

has lodged with the Court a blown-up exhibit of a series

19

of such maps.

California

That this shoreline change would not have

25

function as a barrier to the down-coast drift of sand

During that time, the jetty ceased to

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and the shoreline reverted to its natural

2 configuration.

Once the jetty was rebuilt, the

3 artifical deposition process continued, covering up and
4 filling in the land,

resulting in the current coastline

5 configuration.

Never considered part of the Coast Guard site,

6

7 the land remains barren and unused.

The Coast Guard

8 even applied to California for use of the land, which
9 the Coast Guard characterized as "artificially accreted
10 land belonging to California."

11

Only belatedly did the

United States assert that it owned this artificially

12 accreted land according to federal law applied by virtue
13 of the rule of Hughes versus Washington.
14

After some peregrinations, this is now the

15 essential position of the United States before this
16 Court.
17

QUESTION;

The state has not been exactly

18 consistent.
19

MR. FLUSHMAN;

We believe our position has

20 been consistent.
21

QUESTION;

Well, you have not abandoned a

22 single part of any of your claims.
23
24 White.
25

MR. FLUSHMAN;

I do not believe so. Justice

Our position is quite simple.
QUESTION;

I take it you are not asserting any

estoppel principle against the United States for having

2 applied —

3

HR. FLUSHMAN:

We are not.

The United States

4 versus California, 332 U.S., we believe, bars us from
5 doing so.
6

QUESTIONS

Would this case be here if that

7 movement on the part of the admiral out there had not
8 taken place?

9

MR. FLUSHMAN*

I think it still would be.

We

10 believe that what the admiral did is to show that the

11 manager of the land believed that the land — the
12 manager of the lands adjacent to the subject lands did

13 not believe that the subject lands were part of the
14 Coast Guard site.

We believe that that is an

15 interpretation by a person of some administrative
16 authority which is entitled to some weight by this Court
17 in considering the questions before it, but it does not
18 constitute an estoppel.
19

QUESTION:

Has the watchtower ever been built?

20

MR. FLUSHMAN*

21

QUESTION*

The watchtower was built.

Otherwise, are the subject lands

22 used for any purpose?

23

MR. FLUSHMAN*

They are used by members of the

24 public to traverse that portion of the shoreline.

They

25 are not used by the United States in any other fashion.

1

QUESTION;

And they do not in any wise

2 interfere with the operation of the Coast Guard site?
3

MR. FLUSHMAN;

I do not believe so.

The

4 entrance to the Pacific Ocean is on the other side of
5 the spit.

The Coast Guard site is on a very open and

6 rough shoreline.

It would be impossible, at least, I

7 believe it to be impossible for boats to enter the
8 Pacific Ocean from the shoreward side of the Coast Guard
9 site.
10

QUESTION;

And do we know whether the United

11 States has any plans for its use?

12

MR. FLUSHMAN;

I — my belief is that the

13 entire Coast Guard base has been declared surplus, and
14 will be transferred to either a state or public agency

15 or to private parties.
16

QUESTION;

Mr. Flushman, as I understand it,

17 the Coast Guard reservation was acquired by the federal

18 government after California had become a state.
19

MR. FLUSHMAN;

Justice O’Connor, the land that

20 comprises the Coast Guard site was ceded to the United
21 States in the Treaty of Guadeloupe Hidalgo, and is part
22 of the public lands of the United States.

At the time

23 that California became a state in 1850, all of the tide
24 and submerged lands that were in California — excuse
25 me, all of the tidelands in California and the submerged

2 California as the result of its sovereignty and the
3 Submerged Lands Act.

The uplands remained in the United

4 States for whatever disposition the United States
5 desired to take.
6

QUESTION*

And the formal withdrawal by the

7 United States of the parcel for the purposes of building
8 a lighthouse originally?
9
10

MR. FLUSHMAN:
QUESTION*

Yes.

Were there any terms or provisions

11 in the withdrawal that would affect any rights that the
12 United States would have reserved for the tidelands?
13

MR. FLUSHMAN*

The reservation orders are

14 contained in the exhibits, and they refer to lots and
15 sections of particular townships.
16

QUESTION*

Right.

That is why it’s hard to

17 interpret them.
18

MR. FLUSHMAN*

Those lots and sections are

19 described also in one of the exhibits which is the

20 township plat that was prepared by the United States.
21 The shoreward boundary of those — or the seaward
22 boundary of those lots is the boundary of the public
23 lands of

the United States.

24 States could reserve.

That is all the United

California owned the lands that

25 were below the ordinary high water mark.

That is what

13

MR. FLUSHMAN;

I am suggesting that --

That isn't what California held.
— that 381 U.S., United States

14 versus California, determined the ownership of lands,
15 the decree as a result of that case determined the
16 ownership of lands below the low water mark in
17 California.

What the ownership had always been.

QUESTION;

I'm sorry?

Determined what the ownership had

21 always been.
22

MR. FLUSHMAN;

It determined what the

Our

24 contention is that that ownership as a matter of equity

15

MR. FLUSHMANs

It is not.

As admitted by the

16 United States in its answer, the depositions that were
17 caused by the jetty were deposited below the ordinary
18 high water mark on California's sovereign tidelands.
19 This conclusion is found in the decisions of

20 Court.

this

Although in United States versus California, as

21 I have mentioned, the state's title to tidelands, lands
22 that lie landward of the low water mark but seaward of
23 the high water mark,

was not questioned.

The Court

24 explicitly recognized California’s title to tidelands.
25 This title was also confirmed in the Submerged Lands Act.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
Ann VIRGINIA AVF

S.W . WASHINGTON D O 9nr>9A 19091 RRA-93AR

In United States versus California, 381 U.S.,

1

2 this Court set the seaward boundary of the state’s open

3 coast tidelands at the low water mark as that mark
4 actually exists.

Thus, the low water mark boundary of

5 tidelands follows physical reality, no matter the cause
6

of the change in its physical location, whether natural

7 or gradual, sudden — whether natural or artificial,
8 sudden or gradual.

In this case, as the jetty-caused depositions

10 occurred along' the Coast Guard
11

site, the low water mark

was pushed further and further seaward.

12 hand,

On the other

under California law, the high water boundary of

13 tidelands does not remain ambulatory in these
14 conditions.

Under undisputed California law, when the

15 depositions are caused by the works of man, as here,
16 they are treated as artificial accretions owned by the
17 state.
18

The effect of this rule is to fix the high

19 water mark boundary in its location immediately prior to
20 the effect of the artificial works.
21 the rule concerning an evulsion,

This is similar to

which also results in

22 the fixing of a boundary at a former location.

Thus, as

23 all depositions occurred seaward of the high water mark
24 fixed in location immediately prior to the jetty
25 construction, but landward of the low water mark, such

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

depositions occurred on California's tidelands in which

2 California, as admitted by the United States, has
3 absolute title.
4

QUESTION:

Why wouldn't you submit the same

5 rule would apply to accretions on your tidelands if they
6 didn't occur artificially?
7

ME. FLUSHMAN:

That is a decision which

8 California submits each state makes for itself.
9

QUESTION:

So — all right.

In this case, if

10 it were decided that these were natural rather than
11 artificially caused accretions, what would the
12 California law be?
13

MR. FLUSHMAN:

California law would be that

14 those accretions go to the upland owner.

The upland

15 owner *s boundary would move out as the accretions
16 occurred.
17

QUESTION:

So a critical factor in this case

18 is whether these are natural or artificial?
19

MR. FLUSHMAN:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice White.

Under —

I mean, even — under your

21 submission, even that.
22

MR. FLUSHMAN:

The critical fact in this — as

23 to this part of the case is that these were artificially

Yes.

MS. FLUSHHAN:

— and under California law

2 there is no question but that they were artifically
3 caused.

California's conclusion, I will frankly admit,

4 depends on the application of state law to decide the
5 boundary contest between the upland owner, the United
6 States, and California, the owner of the tidelands, over
7 the effect of the movement of their mutual boundary, the
8 high water mark.
9

California submits that the rule of American

10 jurisprudence since California — since Pollard's Lessee
11 versus Hagan

was decided in 1845, has been that the

12 effect on land title of after statehood changes in the
13 high water boundary of sovereign lands such as tidelands
14 is decided under state law.

Long established precedents

15 of this Court have held that state law applies to
16 determine the right of littoral owners in sovereign
17 lands.
18

Thus, the United States had no expectation to

19 the land formed by

jetty construction based on

20 application of federal law.

This rule is founded in the

21 constitutional doctrines which

preserve the basic powers

22 and sovereign attributes, sovereign inherent attributes
23 of

the states.

The rule has been recognized by this

24 Court, which holds that state sovereign title is

25 absolute so far as any federal principle of land titles

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

was concerned, and cannot be defeased by application of

2 federal common law.

In fact, the United States admits in Paragraph

3

4 5 of its answer that the state’s title to tidelands
5 lying landward of the coastline as these lands do is

6 absolute.

Although the United States recognizes this

7

8 rule, it seeks to restrict its application solely to
9 sovereign lands underlying inland waters,

but other than

10 an offhand reference to Hughes, there is no reason given
11

that would distinguish tidelands along inland waters

12 from

tidelands along the open coast.

Presumably, the

13 United States argues, based on Hughes,
14 international relations implications in

that there are
the

15 determination of the high water boundary along the open
16 coast that require creation of federal common law.

Our opening brief, at Pages 13 to 18, disposes

17

18 of this contention,
19 by

and none of the three briefs filed

the United States elaborates on this point or

20 responds to those arguments.

Hughes, if it has any

21 remaining viability, should be overruled.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. FLUSHMAN:

24 this case.

If it isn’t, is it controlling here?
Hughes would be controlling in

This case is an analogue to Hughes.

It

25 involves open coast lands.

WASHINGTON D C. 9Cif)9A

554-2345

1

QUESTIONi

Yes.

2

MR. FLUSHMANs

We think Hughes is wrongly

3 decided, however, for the reasons that we have stated in
4 our briefs.
5

The concessions by the United States that

6 state law governs sovereign land boundary conflicts and

7 inland waters at Page 15 of its opening brief and in its
8 answer at Paragraph 5, where it admits that California
9 has absolute title to lands that are landward of the

10 coastline, are dispositive of this question.

The rule

11 cannot be otherwise, as the state’s title to such
12 tidelands, whether along the open coast or along inland

13 waters is constitutionally founded.
14

Thus, the application of state law to decided

15 contests over such lands cannot be limited solely to

16 lands under inland water.

Such state laws apportion

17 changes between competing landowners in accordance with

18 the customs and usages that have grown up in the state
19 after long experience.

This is a workable regime,

20 consisting of a defined body of rules relied on by all
21 property-owners in the state in the management of their
22 holdings, and it makes no difference that the United
23 States is the upland owner.
24

Wilson versus Omaha Indian Tribe recognizes

25 that the mere presence of the United States as the

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 littoral owner does not provide an independent basis for
2 application of federal law.

Further, federal interests

3 are not implicated as long as the state rules of
4 property are not applied discriminatorily.

Surely, the

5 United States cannot complain that California's rule,
6 which fixes the upland boundary at a former location,
7 affects the sovereign interest of the United States, any
8 more than the rule of supposed federal law where an
9 evulsive change would also fix that upland boundary
10 without affecting federal interests.
11

Other than an oblique reference to Hughes, the

12 United States supplies no reason to create a federal
13 rule.

As this is an area that is integrally related to

14 the constitutional sovereignty of the states, and as in
15 Wilson, it requires the adoption of state law as the
16 rule of decision.
17

Independently of the last argument, California

18 submits that the Submerged Lands Act confirms
19 California's title

to the subject lands as "made" lands

20 under the Submerged Lands Act.
21 "made" lands.

These lands are in fact

The jetty was the sole and direct cause

22 of two-thirds of a mile of deposition.

This Court has

23 long referred to such lands formed by such artificial
24 depositions as "made" lands.
25

For example, in Jones versus Johnstone, 59

1 U.S. at 157, and in County of St. Clair versus
2 Lovingston at 90 U.S. at Page 50, in the Senate hearings
3 on the Act, land formed along jetties by tidal action,
4 such as the lands here, was termed by Senator Price
5 Daniel "made" lands.

What makes this statement of great

6 significance, more than the offhand remark, as claimed
7 by the United States, is the fact that it was made by
8 Senator Daniel.

Senator Daniel argued both United

9 States versus California and United States versus Texas
10 before this Court.

Senator Daniel was also one of the

11 Senate’s, if not the Senate’s leading expert on the need
12 for the enactment of the Submerged Lands Act.
13

Further, the remarks of Senator Cordon quoted

14 in California's reply brief at Page 9 show that Congress
15 contemplated the exact situation here.

Lands that were

16 once water-covered but through artificial activity no
17 longer are are confirmed to the state.

Indeed, it is a

18 settled rule of property that the owner of once
19 water-covered land made upland by the littoral owner

20 retains title to those lands.
21

Here, Congress recognized this rule of

22 property and confirmed California's title to the
23 submerged lands which were made upland by the act of the
24 littoral owner.
25

If there was any doubt that Congress intended

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to confirm California's title to the lands formed by
2 artificial deposition, it is dispelled by a consideraion
3 of the purpose of the Submerged Lands Act.

That great

4 purpose was to restore the states to their pre-1947
5 position.

Under settled California law, California was

6 the owner of those lands prior to 1947.

As a matter of

7 equity and justice. Congress confirmed to the states the
8 title that the states thought they had prior to 1947.
9

Now that the United States has retreated from

10 its submerged lands argument, it is clear that this
11 boundary dispute between the owner of tidelands and the
12 adjoining upland owner, as California has repeatedly
13 argued, is wholly extraneous to matters concerned in the
14 determination of the coastline and the offshore boundary
15 under the Submerged Lands Act.
16

The United States urges upon this Court the

17 astounding proposition

that there is a constitutional

18 rule of ambulatory navigable water boundaries which all
19 states accepted as part of their

equal footing grant,

20 and which has been confirmed in the Submerged Lands Act,
21 particularly in Section 5 thereof.

Based on this

22 assertion, the United States claims that Section 5
23 creates in the United States the right to retain
24 accretions to reserved uplands, state law to the
25 contrary notwithstanding.

Such a contention directly conflicts with the

2 basic purpose of the Submerged Lands Act.

Indeed, it

3 places California in a worse position than if the
4 Submerged Lands Act had never been enacted.

Even under

5 the 1947 California decision, California’s title to
6 lands lying landward of the low water mark was
7 unquestioned.

As the Submerged Lands Act was meant to

8 restore the states to their pre-1947 position, it should
9 not be interpreted to deprive California of land lying
10 landward of the low water mark that even under the 1947
11 California decision California owned.
12

Aside from the argument that the plain words

13 of the statute do not except from the confirmation
14 accretions to retained federal uplands, certainly this
15 case does not fall within the class of federal interests
16 that were designed to be protected by Section 5.
17 Section 5 was designed to protect the interests of the
18 United States with respect to any property which it
19 actually occupied or is using.

Especially in this case,

20 where the United States had no expectation at the time
21 the jetty was rebuilt that it would own the land
22 created, where the United States has neither occupied
23 nor used the land, and where the manager of the Coast

24 Guard site considered this land not part of this
25 installation but as belonging to California, Section 5

1 does not except the subject land from operation of the
2 Submerged Lands Act.
3

Finally, so far as the lands here, the lands

4 along the open coast that lie landward of the low water
5 mark., as well as lands underlying inland waters, it is
6 California's position that Section 5 of the Act and
7 those exceptions cannot give the United States any more
8 title to such lands than the United States can establish
9 under state law.

Such lands were already in state

10 ownership by virtue of the equal footing doctrine.

The

11 Submerged Lands Act cannot restrict or defease
12 California of its absolute title to such lands.

The

13 Section 5 exceptions could only condition those lands
14 that were seaward of the low water mark along the open
15 coast which the states lost in the tidelands cases but
16 later received by virtue of the Submerged Lands Act.
17

Using state law to determine the rights of the

18 United States as an upland owner would place no more
19 additional burden on the United

States than on any

20 corporation that does business in more than one state.
21 The United States would be required to research each
22 state 's property laws, hardly a burdensome or an
23 impossible task.

In fact, the Court recently held that

24 such a requirement does not interfere with

25 of the Small Business Administration.

9 premise on which it

is constructed, and the odd results

10 to which it leads.

Hughes versus Washington, has gone the whole way.

That

3

in giving accretions to the upland owner.
But even those contradictions are not the end

5

of it.

The landward boundary itself, according to

6 California,
7

is not frozen when erosion occurs.

That

part of the upland which was shoreward of the tidelands

upland owner.
Now, the rationale of this submission by

11

California is self-contradictory.

successfully argued in this Court some years ago that

13

the federal title to the submerged lands before the

MR. CLAIBORNE;

13

That may be because of the

14

Hughes case.

15

at all events, I take it that it is fair to say that the

16

California rule, if it were free to apply it, would

17

apply it even to federal uplands.
It is right, Mr. Justice White, that this is

18
19

It may be because' of the Bonelli case, but

the California law.

The question is whether that

20 California law producing these inconsistent results
21

ought to be deemed the applicable rule with respect to

22 tidelands.
23
24
25

It is a very greedy rule, because it seeks

to get the best of both worlds.
On the one hand, it invokes Corvallis for the
proposition that title to tidelands is frozen as of

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 statehood, but not content with that, because in this
2 case that would win California only a very narrow strip
3 of the parcel involved, since most of this land was
4 submerged at statehood, California then invokes Bonelli
5 for the proposition that the equal footing doctrine
6 grants continually as time progresses, long after
7 statehood, any lands which acquire the character of
8 tidelands.
9

No case in this Court has remotely suggested

10 that this acquisitive doctrine, which works in only one
11 direction, ought to be condoned.
12

Now, as applied to lands of the United States,

13 the California submission produces this strange result,
14 which is that although the United States expressly
15 reserves for purposes connected with its maritime access
16 lands along the coast defined in the reservation as lots
17 which in turn are defined as bounded by the high water
18 mark, as California itself describes those lots, they
19 meandered, and they are meant to move, so one would
20 suppose from the fact that the seaward boundary is —
21 the United States having reserved this area for a
22 maritime purpose, it can, through imposition of a
23 California state rule, which doesn't happen to be as
24 greedy as Washington’s state rule, but the principle is

25 the same, can be deprived of its access to the sea.

Now, this, we suggest, something —

9

QUESTION:

So you suggest then that you aren't

10 necessarily deciding what the result would be here if
11 the United States had patented the land to a private
12 party?
13

HE. CLAIBORNE:

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Justice White --

That would be Hughes, I suppose,

15 would it?
16

MR. CLAIBORNE:

That would be Hughes.

Now, we

17 suggest that these anomalies, these odd results can be
18 avoided in one of three different ways.

The first, and

19 simplest, is for this Court to adhere to its Hughes
20 decision, which applies not only to land still held by
21 the United States but to lands granted by the United
22 States, in other words, not to apply the Corvallis rule
23 to the open coast, as Corvallis itself hesitated to do.
24

QUESTION:

I don't know that I caught your

25 response to my brother White, Mr. Claiborne.

Did you

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 say that you think Hughes disposes of this case unless
2 it is overruled?
3

HR. CLAIBORNE*

If Hughes were adhered to, it

4 disposes of this case, as I think ray opponents conceded .
5

QUESTION*

I thought he did, too.

6

MR. CLAIBORNE*

That is one way in which the

7 Court can most simply avoid the incongruities which I
8 have outlined.

The second, if there is a logical

9 inconsistency between the survival of Hughes and the
10 survival of the Corvallis doctrine, I would invite the
11 Court to question whether the right of accretions as
12 added to uplands which have been universally recognized
13 from Roman times through English law through all
14 American law until very recently in some few states as
15 appertaining to the upland-lowland, is not one of those
16 property rights, right of private property, which no
17 state can defease without violating the just
18 compensation clause.

That is assuming that state law

19 applies.
20

QUESTION*

Do you mean that a state would not

21 be free upon its admission to the union to adopt a
22 different rule than that?
23

MR. CLAIBORNE*

Perhaps upon its admission to

24 the union, but there is no indication that California or
25 any other state has ever adopted such a rule that far

back.

Indeed, here, I invoke the concurring opinion of

2 Justice Stewart in the Hughes case.

Washington changed

3 its law in 1966, and Justice Stewart said to allow that
4 to destroy property vested at statehood in the
5 predecessor of Mrs. Hughes would violate the just
6

compensation clause, and accordingly, they had a

7 judgment.
8

QUESTION*

Would there be room to distinguish

9 between private uplands and public uplands?
10

SR. CLAIBORNE*

Well, that would be the third

11 way in which the Court can avoid these anomalies, that
12 is, to follow the rule of Wilson,

which was simply an

13 application of the general rule that federal law
14 controls the boundaries of federal land.

Whether to

15 borrow state land is therefore the only question if one
16 takes this approach, now, in Wilson the Court found it
17 appropriate to do so.

Here, I would invite the Court to

18 turn to the Submerged Lands Act as the federal rule of
19 decision.

Section 5 of the Submerged Lands Act very

20 explicitly and plainly says that when the United States
21 reserves lands, it

reserves it together with the
Therefore, we don't have to confect

23 a common law rule for this purpose.

We turn to the rule

24 which Congress itself has enacted, and very
25 appropriately, in this very context.

We apply that

2 and do not borrow state law.
3

QUESTION:

Do you think that Congress could

4 pass a general law somewhat like the Submerged Lands Act
5 except applicable to all 50 states saying, in effect,
6 that we reserve such and such lands when they are
7 connected to land owned by the United States?
8

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice Rehnquist, I think

9 Congress has done precisely that in Section 5 of the
10 Submerged Lands Act.
11

QUESTION:

Well, what authority does it have

12 to do that?
13

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, it has that authority

14 only if no constitutional rule barred the way, and here,
15 with respect to tidelands, there was no constitutional
16 rule announced by this Courtt to the effect that
17 accretions which occur along the open coast belong to
18 the states, and therefore Congress was free to make
19 disposition accordingly.
20

QUESTION:

Do you think Congress could

21 overrule the decision in Corvallis by simply passing a
22 statute that said state rules of decision along inland
23 waters'shall not divest the federal government of
24 property which it owns along those waters except on
25 conditions that Congress lays down?

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

HR. CLAIBORNEi

No, Justice Rehnguist, I do

2 not suppose that Congress can overrule Corvallis.
3 Corvallis, as I appreciate it, has two parts.

Insofar

4 as it rests on the equal footing doctrine, it does not
5 for the most part aid California here, because Corvallis
6 holds that the equal footing doctrine is fully spent at
7 statehood, and most of these lands did not become
8 tidelands, much less uplands, until long after
9 statehood.

Most of them were submerged, and therefore

10 not sovereign lands of California, therefore not vested
11 under the equal footing doctrine, but California reads
12 the equal footing doctrine notwithstanding Corvallis as
13 granting more, as continual grant, as indeed it is fair
14 to say it appears Congress read the equal footing
15 doctrine in 1953, because it very plainly made an
16 ambulatory grant.
17

The courts up to that time, most read it,

18 including members of this Court, as late as 1973, read
19 the equal footing doctrine as merely an ambulatory
20 grant, which was of some advantage to the states, in
21 that it vested title to newly formed navigable water
22 bottoms, whereas under the Court's holding in Corvallis,
23 that is not true, and yet Corvallis did hold in favor of

24 Oregon with respect to a newly formed bed, but not under
25 the equal footing doctrine.

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Now, if that aspect of Corvallis, we suggest,

2 ouaht not be made applicable to the coast,

and indeed

3 Corvallis itself, and no single decision of this Court
4 has ever doubted that accretions as opposed to the
5 effect of evulsions, that accretions did not innure to
6 the upland owner.

Indeed, the decisions quoted in

7 Corvallis pointed out that this is the universal rule.
8 The only question in those cases was with respect to

9 title to manmade land or what happens in the case of
10 unusual evulsions.

11

QUESTION*

Most of those decisions, though,

12 were in the pre-Erie days, were they not, when the Court

13 was simply laying down — following its own notion of
14 common law?
15

MR. CLAIBORNE:

But as the Court pointed out

16 in Corvallis, even in the period of Erie, state property
17 law rules were generally thought to be an exception to
18 the federal common law, but the Court seemed to be
19 understanding that the right to naturally formed
20 accretions is a property right,

8 California in the 1950‘s in connection with Number 5 and
9 Number 6 Original, in the briefs filed in this case, no

We rest on our written submission with respect

17 to the arguments made under the Submerged Lands Act.
18 Let me simply make this point about the Submerged Lands
19 Act argument.

It seems clear to us that these lands are

20 not made, filled in, or reclaimed lands within the
21 meaning of the provision invoked by California, but —

9 arguably does cover our case, in the particular

11 the Submerged Lands Act makes clear that such lands will
12 not innure to the state, are not confirmed in the state,
13 but on the contrary, when made by the United States, as
14 in the case of this land allegedly, appertain to the
15 upland United States reservation, and it also makes
16 clear in a provision which we think governs here, that
17 accretions to reserved lands of the United States are
18 included in the reservation, and in that respect, the
19 Submerged Lands Act document in our view fails.

Unless there are questions from the Court, I

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. FLUSHMANx

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

2

In response to one question from the Court, I

3 would like to advise the Court as to what the state of
4 California law is concerning artificial accretions.
5 has been the rule in the state since 1866.

It

The cases

6 that are cited in the Carpenter case, which is cited in
7 our brief, and in the People versus Hecker case, also
8 cited in our brief, go back to 1866 and form a continuum
9 of cases that stem from that date.

So, the Carpenter

10 case and the Hecker case after the Submerged Lands Act
11 worked no change in the law that was adverted to by
12 Justice Stewart in the Carpenter case.

There was no

13 defeasance of the right of a littoral owner to
14 accretions.
15

With respect to accretions to upland, this

16 Court held in 1876 that each state decides for itself
17 who gets title to those accretions.

This was in Barney

18 versus Keokuk, which is cited in our brief.

Two years

19 later, the Court decided County of St. Clair versus
20 Lovingston, which is the main case concerning accretions
21 on which the United States relies.
22

That case was a state law case.

The authority

23 that is relied on in County of St. Clair is a New York
24 case, and it was done, as is pointed out, during the
25 rule of Swift versus Tyson, when local real property

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

2

QUESTION;

Well, wasn't Lovingston against St.

3 Clair something in the Mississippi River?
4

MR. FLUSHMAN;

5

QUESTION;

Yes, it was.

Well, why did they use a New York

6 case?
7

MR. FLUSHMAN;

It was a common law case, the

8 common law of Illinois, which looked to New York.
9

The reference that California courts might not

10 apply the Carpenter rule to federally owned upland is
11 based on a statement in Carpenter where an exception
12 appears to have been made for federally owned upland.
13 That court was relying on the Borax decision, which had
14 been decided some eight years earlier, and was using the
15 same expansive reading of Borax that this Court has said
16 in Corvallis was erroneous.
17

With respect to Hughes versus Washington, if

18 it has not been overruled by Corvallis, which we contend
19 it is, my concession is limited to that submission.
20

QUESTION;

May I ask you on the -- I take it

21 that does not cover your argument on the Submerged Land
22 Act.
23

MR. FLUSHMAN;

24

QUESTION;

It does not.

Now, on that statute, what is your

25 response — I just may not recall it — to the argument

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 about Section 5 of the Submerged Land Act, that in any
2 event there is an exception for accretion to — United
3 States lands including accretions thereto?
4

MR. FLUSHMANs

The exception under the

5 Submerged Lands Act in Section 5 is termed in clauses.
6 There are four or five different clauses.

The first

8 are acquired by the United States.

The second clause

9 pertains to lands that were either ceded to or reserved
10 by the United States.
11 attaching to that.

There is no accretions clause

Now, the United States makes a jump

12 of logic to — or a jump of statutory interpretation to
13 also attach the accretions clause in the first clause of
14 Section 5 to the second clause of Section 5, but that is
15 not our main argument.
16

Our main argument is that with respect to

17 tidelands, lands that lay above the low water mark, the
18 Court in United States versus California in 1947 did not
19 dispute the state's title.
20 low water mark.

These lands lie above the

The Congress in 1953 could not defease

21 the state of its title to those lands.

So, we contend

22 that the term "accretion", assuming it is attached to
23 the second clause of Section 5, is given content as a
24 matter of state law.
25

We rely on that submission as part — because

2 referred to.

In Section 3 of the Submerged Lands Act as

3 well the lands that are granted or are restored or
4 confirmed under the Act are to be administered under
5 state law, and also under Section 3, Section 3 looks to
6 those persons who were entitled to those lands in June,
7 1950, under state law, so state law is — references to
8 state law are replete throughout the Act.

We contend that this is an express intent of

10 Congress, that federal common law, a new common law rule
11 under Federal law should not be created, but that the
12 rules of state law should be looked to to interpret the
13 Submerged Lands Act.

Under that contention,

14 California's rule would apply.

The United States would

15 not receive artificially accreted lands that attached to
16 its upland holdings.
17

Unless the Court has any further questions, I

18 have nothing.
