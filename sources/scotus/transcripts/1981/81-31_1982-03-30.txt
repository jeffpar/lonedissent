CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

2

Mrs. Shapiro, you may

3 proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARRIET S. SHAPIRO, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

5

MS. SHAPIRO;

6

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

7 please the Court;
This case is here by the United States and the

8

9 State of California from a decision of the District
10 Court
11

for the Central District of California holding

that the Federal Unemployment Tax Act and its state

12 counterpart may not constitutionally protect the

13 employees of certain religiously oriented schools.
14

Last term this Court decided in St. Martin

15 Evangelical Lutheran Church versus South Dakota that 26
16 U.S.C. 3309(b) exempted the employees of schools
17 operated by a church or organization of churches from
18 coverage under the federal-state unemployment tax
19 system.

The district court decided this case before St.

20 Martin was handed down.
21

□ur case originally involved three kinds of

22 schools.

The district court identified them as;

23 category one schools, those operated directly by a
24 church or organization of churches -- and category one
25 schools are the only kind that were involved in St.

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Martin; catagory two schools are separately
2 incorporated, but controlled or operated by a church or

3 organization of churches, primarily for religious
4 purposes; category three schools are religiously
5 oriented schools that are independent of any specific
6 church or organization of churches.
7

The district court found that Section 3309(b)

8 and the counterpart state statute exempted category one
9 and category two schools, but not category three
10 schools.

Hone of the parties here contest that ruling,

11 so there's no statutory issue before this Court.

12

QUESTION*

Although the Missouri Synod

13 Lutherans are here, with a brief, anyway, aren't they?

They filed a brief. yes.

14

MS. SHAPIRO*

15

The district court also held that the category

16 three schools have a First Amendment right to exemption
17 from the Act, because the state could not make benefit

18 determinations for employees of these statements without
19 becoming unconstitutionally entangled in matters of
20 religious doctrine.
21

The schools also make a free exercise claim in

22 their cross-appeal.
23

The First Amendment claims of the category

24 three schools, that is those not associated with any
25 church, are the only issues before this Court in this

This Court’s recent --

3

QUESTION*

Mas the free exercise claim

4 presented below?
5

NS. SHAPIROs

6

QUESTION*

7

S3. SHAPIROs

Yes, it was.

Not ruled on?
Yes, it was ruled on and the

8 district court rejected it.
QUESTION*

9

Rejected it?

10

BS. SHAPIROs

11

QUESTION*

Yes.

Well, there is a cross-appeal on

12 that issue?
13

NS. SHAPIROs

14

This Court’s recent decision in United States

15 v.

There is a cross-appeal, yes.

Lee substantially answers the First Amendment claim.

16 Indeed, this case follows a fortiori from Lee, because
17 in Lee payment of the tax was itself

a sin.

There's no

18 such claim here.

19

QUESTION*

Do we get to this issue until we

20 decide whether the Tax Injunction Act bars
21 jurisdiction?
22

S3. SHAPIROs

That’s a jurisdictional

23 question.
24

QUESTION*

Well, shouldn’t we address that

25 before we get to the merits?

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MS. SHAPIRO*

Well, yes, there is that

2 question in the case, and we've certainly discussed it
3 in our brief, and also —
4

QUESTION;

Well, aren't you going to discuss

5 it here?

6

MS. SHAPIROs

7

QUESTION*

8

MS. SHAPIROs

9

QUESTION;

I hadn’t planned to unless —

Well, let me ask you a question.
Certainly.

As I understand your position, and

10 I guess that of the State as well, it is that the
11 declaratory judgment action was barrel by the Tax
12 Injunction Act, and yet for some reason we can
13 nevertheless reach
14 question.
15

the merits of the religious clause

How do we do that?
MS.

How do we get that jump?

SHAPIRO* Well, the argument basically is

16 —

17

QUESTION*

First of all, am I right that you

18 do say the Tax Injunction

Act bars a declaratory

19 judgment action?
20

MS.

SHAPIRO; Yes.

21

QUESTION*

22

MS.

That is the Government's position?

SHAPIRO* Yes, that's theGovernment's

23 position.
24

QUESTION*

25

MS.

And yet we should reach the —

SHAPIRO* That's right.

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION

How?

2

MS. SHAPIRO:

Our argument is that this

3 Court's — this Court's jurisdiction does not depend on

4 tha district court having had jurisdiction.

We rely on

5 cases like McLucas and Weinberger versus Salfi, in which
6 this Court said, although there is questions, there may
7 be questions about the district court's jurisdiction,
8 they don't have to reach those questions because under

9 Section 1252 this Court has direct appeal jurisdiction
10 whenever a statute — whenever there's a constitutional
11 question about a federal statute.
12

QUESTION:

Evan though the district court had

13 no jurisdiction?
14

NS. SHAPIRO:

Even though the district court

15 had no jurisdiction.
16

QUESTION:

Evan if wa have jurisdiction,

17 doesn't the Tax Injunction Act apply to us as well as to
18 tha district court, and wa would in effect be giving a

19 declaratory judgment, which is prohibited by that
20 statute?
21

NS. SHAPIRO:

The Tax Injunction Act prohibits

22 the district court from enjoining or suspending or
23 restraining.

So I don't believe that it applies to this

24 Court.
25

QUESTION:

Do you think this Court could

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 freely exercise its equitable powers and grant
2 injunctions as if the Tax Injunction Act diin't exist,
3 on a review of a district court proceeding?
4

MS. SHAPIRO*

Well, this is — we're not

5 asking that you grant an injunction.

All we're asking

6 is that under Section 1252 you remove the cloud that the
7 district court's opinion here has placed on the —
8

QUESTION*

Yes, but Mrs. Shapiro, I gather the

9 district court certainly is barred from granting any
10 kind of relief, is it not, by the Tax Injunction Act?
11

MS. SHAPIRO*

12

QUESTION*

13

MS. SHAPIRO*

14

QUESTION*

15

That's our --

Well then, how can we grant any?
Well —

And we can't send it back to them

to grant it, because they have no jurisdiction to grant

16 it.
MS. SHAPIRO*

17

Well, we're not — we don't

18 think that you should grant an injunction.
19

20
21

But in

McLucas —
QUESTION*

Well, even a declaratory judgment,

since you do agree that the Tax Injunction Act bars a

22 declaratory judgment.
23

MS. SHAPIRO :

By the district court.

24

QUESTION*

Yes.

25

QUESTION*

Well, we might have jurisdiction on

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the appeal, that's right.
2 appeal?

But what is open on the

The first guastion that's open on the appeal is

3 whether the

district court had jurisdiction, and if it

4 lid — and if it did, why, we get to the merits; if it
5 didn't, I don't know why you wouldn't just vacate the
6 district court's judgment.
7

MS. SHAPIBOs

8

QUESTION;

9 you,

Well —

That'll get rid of what worries

anyway.

10

MS. SHAPIBOi

Well, in one sense it will,

11 meaning that this, the opinion of the district court, is
12 not a precedent.

On the other hand, this issue has been

13 raised and it's going to be here on review of the state

14 court decision, as in St. Martin's.
15
16 no

QUESTION:

Well, but if the district court had

jurisdiction then there isn't any injunction.

17

MS. SHAPIBOs

Well, but the issue has been

18 raised and it's —

19

QUESTION;

Well, that sounds to me — really,

20 Mrs. Shapiro, so often we get lawyers standing where you
21 are who tell us, well, maybe there isn't any
22 jurisdiction, but we really want to have you decide it
23 anyway.

And that sounds like the same kind of argument

24 to me. If I may say so.
25

MS. SHAPIBOs

Well, except that in McLucas and

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2346

1 in Salfi, both oases which came here under Section 1252,
2 on a direct appeal because a statute of the United
3 States has been drawn in question as contrary to the
4 Constitution, this Court said that there was substantial
5 question about the jurisdiction of the district court.
6

QUESTION*

On what basis was that?

7

NS. SHAPIROs

Well, in Salfi the question was

8 whether or not the district court had jurisdiction to
9

issue an injunction under Section 405(g).

And the Court

10 said, regardless of that we have direct appeal
11

jurisdiction under 1252 and so we don’t have to decide

12 that.
In KcLucas the question was whether the

13
14

decision below was properly decided by a single court --

15

single judge instead of a three-judge court.

16

similarly, the Court said, we don't have to decide

17

whether there was jurisdiction in the single-judge

And

18 district court —
QUESTION*

19

Hell, there certainly was

20

jurisdiction in one district court or the other there,

21

one kind of a district court or the other.

22 anY question.

There wasn't

But here the question is whether district

23

courts in general have any authority to do what this

24

court did.

25

US. SHAPIRO*

But it was also — well,

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 similarly in Weinberger versus Salfi, the question was
2 whether any district court had jurisdiction to issue an
3 injunction.

And in McLucas it was whether that single

4 judge had jurisdiction to do what he had done.
5

6 do?

QUESTION*

What particularly do you want us to

What order do you want us to give?

7

MS. SHAPIRO*

8

QUESTION*

And you don't reach the merits?

9

QUESTION;

To reverse the incorrect judgment.

10

MS. SHAPIRO*

To vacate the decision below.

Yes, certainly, we want you to

11 just reverse the judgment -12

QUESTION*

And tell the district court to do

13 what?
14

MS. SHAPIRO*

15

QUESTION;

16

MS. SHAPIRO*

17

QUESTION;

18

MS. SHAPIRO*

19

QUESTION*

20

MS. SHAPIRO*

21

QUESTION;

To dismiss.

Tell them to dismiss?
Yes, yes.

On the merits?
On the merits, absolutely, yes.

On the merits?
Yes.

Even though it has no district

22 court to decide the merits?
23

MS. SHAPIRO*

The principle, the reason for

24 the Tax Injunction Act is to —
25

QUESTION*

We tell the district court, you

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 don't have jurisdiction, but dismiss?
2

MS. SHAPIRO*

3

QUESTION *

4

MS. SHAPIRO*

5

QUESTION;

Uh-hmm.
Is that right?
Yes.
It wouldn't satisfy your purposes

6 if we directed them to dismiss on the grounds that they
7 had no jurisdiction?
8

MS. SHAPIRO*

No, because that would not

9 resolve the cloud that’s cast on —

10

QUESTION*

Hell, you don't always resolve

11 every guestion as soon as it arises, as you know.
12 Sometimes we wait until we have jurisdiction.

13

MS. SHAPIRO*

That's right.

But the guestion

14 is not whether you have jurisdiction; it's whether the
15 district court had jurisdiction.

And it's not a

16 situation in which there was any Article III problem

17 with the district court's jurisdiction.

There's no

18 guestion that there's a case or controversy here.

19 There's no guestion that we're not asking you for an
20 advisory opinion.
21

QUESTION:

Well, shouldn't we decide both

22 questions, though, or at least — I don't know.

Would

23 you say it would be all right with you if we said, well,
24 they were wrong on the merits, but also they didn't have
25 jurisdiction?

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

HS. SHAPIROj

1

Well, you can certainly do what

2 you did in McLucas and Salfi and say, passing the
3

question of jurisdiction, on the merits —
QUESTION:

4
5

Do you suppose, would you make the

same argument if the question was case or controversy?

6

HS. SHAPIRO:

7

QUESTION:

8

NS. SHAPIRO:

9
10

No.

Why not?
Because there there is a

jurisdictional bar — I mean, a constitutional bar not
only to the district court but to this Court, too.
QUESTION:

11

Well, but that would be one thing

12

if we hadn't construed the Tax Injunction Act to extend

13

to declaratory judgments as well as injunctions.

14

here the district court had 1— the only thing the

15

district court could do was issue one or the other.

16

couldn't get away from home base, under the Tax

17

Injunction Act.

18

the way we've construed the Tax Injunction Act; right or

19

not ?

20
21

But

It

It just couldn't, couldn’t do a thing,

HS. SHAPIRO:

That's correct as far as the

district court's concerned, but not as far as this

22 Court's concerned.
23

QUESTION;

24

BS. SHAPIRO;

25

All right.
Well, my argument on the merits

basically is that this case really follows from Lee and

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that Lae stands for the principle that once you enter
2 the marketplace and hire employees to provide goods or
3 services,

you cannot deny those employees the benefit of

4 generally applicable statutory protections.
5 First Amendment

There’s no

right to deny one’s employees the

6 economic security of social security and unemployment
7 insurance coverage,

any more than there is a First

8 Amendment right to deny them a safe workplace or the
9 protection of child labor laws.

10

The further question is whether or not there

11 is a reasonable basis for distinguishing between
12 category one and two schools and category three
13 schools.

And we submit that this is a reasonable,

14 bright-line

test, and once you — if that bright-line

15 test does not apply,
16 determining

than that the question of

when — what schools are so religious in

17 orientation that they should be treated as category two
18 schools involves very serious problems of distinguishing
19 between schools that are going

20

to be of various types.

You really can’t make a distinction based on

21 the degree of the school’s religious orientation,
22 because religious orientation is not a readily
23 identifiable characteristic by which various schools can
24 be compared.

In sum, we don’t believe there’s any

25 constitutional reason to deny the employees of these

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

independent schools of the unemployment benefits that

2 Congress decided they should enjoy.

Congress properly

3

determined that they should be treated the same as their

4

counterparts in private sector schools and this Court

5

should not overturn that determination.

6

I'd like to reserve the remainder of my time.

7

CHIEF JUSTICE BUBGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY M. VESELY, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

9

MR. VESELY;

10
11

Mr. Vesely.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
I wish to clarify first the State of

12
13

California's position with respect to the 1341 issue

14

that was raised by the Court here.

15

mind is that a plain, speedy and adequate remedy must be

16

available at state law and state court before the Tax

17

Injunction Act arises here.
Now, the State's position is very simply this,

18
19

What must be kept in

is that the Federal Government — there was relief

20 sought against the Federal Government directly in this
21

case.

There was injunctive relief sought, declaratory

22 relief sought.
23

A federal statute was being challenged.

The Federal Government could not be compelled

24

to litigate any kind of these issues in state court if

25

it didn't wish to.

In fact, the Federal Government did

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

remove one of these two cases, the Lutheran case, from

2 state court to federal court.

3

So basically «hat it comes down to is that,

4 like was noted in your Java decision of, I think, 402
5 U.5., where in a footnote towards the end of the
6 decision at page 135 it was noted that to accord

7 complete relief to the plaintiffs in that particular
8 case the question was raised whether or not the Federal

9 Government should have been a party in the action as
10

wel .
And the State would submit that as a, for

11
12

better use of a term, as an exception to this case so

13 that the Court could reach the merits, which everybody
14 wishes —
15

QUESTION*

An exception to- the Tax Injunction

16 Act ?
17

MB. VESELY*

To the Tax Injunction Act.

Is

18 basically on the terms of the Tax Inunction Act -19

QUESTION*

Well now, would you say an

20 exception or that there is no adequate state —
21

MB. VESELY*

Well, I would say that the

22 exception —

23

QUESTION*

Within the meaning of the statute.

24

MB. VESELY*

— is probably an improper word.

25 I think. Justice Brennan, that it's probably that it

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

just doesn’t meet the terms of the statute.
QUESTION*

And this I gather — well, which?

3

Because what’s available in the state courts is not an

4

adequate remedy?

5

SR. VESELY;

In this particular case.

This

6 case was unique for a number of reasons.
7

QUESTION;

Nell, I gather primarily it's

8 because what’s being challenged here as violative of the
9
10
11
12
13
14

federal Constitution is not a state statute, but it's a
federal statute.
SR. VESELY*

Both the federal and state

statutes were challenged.
QUESTION*

I know, but basically it’s the

FUTA, isn’t it, the federal statute?

15

SR. VESELY*

16

QUESTION*

This is true.
And I gather your argument is that

17

it's rather strange that you be remitted, litigants be

18

remitted, to a state court to decide the federal

19

question of the constitutionality of a federal statute

20 under the statute Constitution, is that it?
21

SR. VESELY;

This is the position we're

22 taking, and especially in this particular case.

In the

23

position — excuse me — that the State of California

24

took in this case, the conformity process that’s

25

inherent in FUTA came into play —

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTIONS

Is there anything unique about a

2 state court deciding a federal constitutional question?
3

MR. VESELYs

Hell, I don't think there's

4 anything unique about that, other than the fact when you
5 have the Federal Government having to be a party in the
6 action, because there was relief sought against them.
7 believe at that point there, that's when the Tax
8 Injunction Act becomes inapplicable.
9

And I think that as a — to maintain the

10 integrity of the Tax Injunction Act, I think that's the
11 only reasonable way to look at this case.

I think an

12 exception, because of the importance of the case —
13

The Government was not a party in

22 by the Federal Government in their reply brief of

speaking of why St. Martin's was guite appropriate to go

quite distinguishable from our case, because of the

1

take it is what yau'rs interested in# why was the

2 Federal Government a necessary party?

MR. VESELYs

3

Because the federal statute was

4

being challenged as well, and the state, because of the

5

conformity process that the federal unemployment tax

6 program has, where the state has to comply with what the
7

Federal Government says or be held out of conformity and

8 therefore forefeit millions of dollars per year,
9
10

perhaps, in various moneys that they get from the
Federal Government.

11

The State initial position in this case — and

12

it actually is not really different, except that part of

13

the case has been resolved, the category one and

14

category two schools -- the State was aligned

15

essentially with the church related schools in that

16

instance .

17

And we filed a motion for a cross-claim

18

against the Federal Government seeking declaratory

19

relief on that particular issue, saying we disagree with

20 your interpretation,
21

the statutory interpretation that

this Court has resolved in St. Martin's, yet on the

22 constitutional issues of whether we get to a category
23

three situation hare, we agree with the Federal

24

Government.

25

And that's where we are before the Court right

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

So the uniqueness of

2 this case was that the Federal Government had to be a

QUESTION*

you say it had to be, but I still

Isn’t there a provision in some of

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the
2

MR. VESELYi

I think that any injunction

3 against federal taxes would be handled under 7421 of the
4 Internal Revenue Code.

This is having to do with state

5 taxes only.
6

So therefore, because of the posture of this

7 case, I think that the only really relief that would
8 accord — possible for the plaintiffs in this matter was

9 to be in federal court, have the Federal Government in
10 there, because the state was stuck in a position of
11 having to try to figure out whether they should comply

12 with what the Federal Government was mandating — excuse
13 me — or decide to follow what the court was telling
14 them to do.

15

Now, the court enjoined the state and the

16 state was stuck into a position of either -- of doing
17 exactly that.

In fact, there is evidence in our case

18 about how conformity proceedings were taken, were begun
19 with respect to the state.

And so the situation of this

20 case, the Federal Government was absolutely essential to
21 be in the case.
22

If I may get to some of the merits of this, I

23 believe that we’ve handled basically all of the issues
24 that we wish to raise in our main brief and also our
25 reply brief.

But I wish to put the case in proper

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

perspective, is that if we get to the merits in this

2 matter — and we wish you do — the employees are
3

basically the forgotteh people in this whole system.
There's evidence, there are discussions

4
5

completely throughout, about the employer's rights, the

6 employer's religious beliefs, the employer's burdens,
7

alleged burdens or whatever they may be.

Yet what it

8 comes down to, if the tax exemption here is extended to
9

cover these non-church affiliated religious employers,

10

what will happen directly is that these employees then

11

are denied benefits.

12

benefits.

13

They cannot get any unemployment

So guite consistent with your decision in U .S.

14

versus Lee is that the employer's beliefs will be

15

basically being imposed upon these employees.

16

have a situation here that we don't have church

17

affiliated schools involved, we have independent

18

religious schools.

19

And we

And these independent religious schools, one

20 of the main reasons they're independent is they don't
21

want to be church affiliated.

They want to draw from as

22 broad a base of students as possible.

And although they

23

may have a requirement of born-again Christians for

24

their teachers or whatever the case may be, there's

25

nothing in the record that says that every one of their

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

employees agrees with their position about the

2 unemployment compensation program.

So to basically deny

3

these employees the right to get unemployment benefits

4

would be a denial of their own beliefs, in fact, if you

5

will.
I think that the situation here is actually

6
7

closely analogous, if not virtually identical, to what

8 Sherbert, Sherbert versus Verner and the Thomas case
9

discussed.

We're talking about a situation there where

10

there was the state action prohibiting the — well, the

11

state action in denial of an employee's benefits was

12

prohibited because of the employee's lack of faith or

13

because of their own faith.

14

that was just not permissible.

15

You, this Court, held that

By the same token here, we have those same

16

benefits being denied to the employees if the exemption

17

is extended, and this time it's because of the

18

employer's beliefs.

19

more permissible in the second instance than it was in

And I would submit that it's no

20 the first instance.
21

QUESTIOBi

Well, what if an employer in a type

22 three or category three school says, we want only
23

teachers who will speak with enthusiasm and sincerity

24

about our, the employer's, religious beliefs.

25

the employer has a right to do that?

Certainly

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. VESELY;

Hell/ I think the employer has

2 the right to put iown however they wish whatever work
3 rules they wish.
4

QUESTION;

Suppose that's a work rule.

Now,

5 if the employee doesn't measure up to it he would be

6 discharged for misconduct, I presume, under California
7 law.
8

HR. VESELY;

Hell, the employer, if the —

9 under California law, the employer must show in a
10 benefit eligibility hearing that there was an
11 established work rule and that work rule was knowingly
12 violated.
13

QUESTION;

Hell, assume that the employer had

14 done that.
15

HR. VESELY;

If the employer does do that,

16 then that employee will be denied any kind of

17 unemployment benefits.
18

QUESTION;

And that’s contrary to his beliefs

19 isn't it?
20

HR. VESELY;

21

QUESTION;

Pardon, Your Honor?
That's contrary to the employee's

22 beliefs, isn't it?
23

HR. VESELY;

Hell, I think that the point of

24 it is is that this whole system is a balancing.

I mean

25 the employer obviously has certain beliefs, and this ha

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

been an accommodation all throughout the entire program.

2 that the employer has certain beliefs, has certain
3

interests that have been accommodated in three

4

fashions:

5

FUTA exemption for all religious employers, the

it’s been accommodated by extension of the

6 extention of the California exemption to church related
7

employers, and finally, that the employer itself has the

8 reiraburseable method of contribution.

So there has been an accommodation of the

9
10

religious employer's beliefs.

There is an accommodation

11

of the religious employee's beliefs as well, but it's

12 under a situation that if the employer changes the work
13

rules after the fact, like a Thomas or a Sherbert case,

14

the employee, if that Is then against his religious

15

beliefs and he wishes not -- that he just cannot comply

16

with this, well then that employee cannot be denied

17

benefits.
So basically what we come to is really a

18
19

balancing.

I mean, it's an attempt to take in

20 everybody's beliefs as possible, but still maintain a
21

comprehensive nationwide program, which is the public's

22 interest in this entire thing, as well as the point of
23

protection against wage loss for the employees.

24

There's — yes. Your Honor?

25

QUESTION:

Do you make any point of the

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 distinction hers?

Church affiliated schools, as I

2 understand, get the exemption
3

SR. VESELY:

4

QUESTION*

5

But a group that’s not so affiliated is denied

That’s right. Your Honor
that's right, isn’t it?

6 the exemption?
7

MR. VESELY:

8

QUESTION*

That’s true. Your Honor.
Hhat’s your position about that

9 difference in classification?
10

MR. VESELY*

Hell, I believe that it follows

11 very directly from U.S. versus Lee.

Hhat has happened

12 here is that there is a narrow, readily identifiable
13 category that has been drawn.

I think that if you don’t

14 draw the line there with respect to church schools or

15 organizations that are operated by churches, we have a
16 problem of potentially getting into, as Judge Stevens
17 said in his concurrence in Lea, of evaluating the merits

18 of each religious belief.
19

I think that the problem that arises there is

20 that you ace getting right involved with potential
21 entanglement.

22

QUESTION*

Hell, nevertheless, what level of

23 scrutiny do you apply to that distinction?

Rationality

24 or —
25

MR. VESELY:

I believe it should be a rational

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 basis on this matter, Your Honor.

The point of it is is

2 that under the unemployment tax there has been
3 classification done since the program began.

The

4 Carmichael case, the initial case on this matter, talked
5 about classification between seven and eight employers;
6 what was the rational basis there?
7

QUESTION;

Well, we didn't have a religious

8 classification.
9

MR. VE3ELY;

That's true.

But we're talking

10 about here trying to stay out of evaluating the merits
11 of each religious belief.

It does not matter that that

12 church that is exempt opposes, is neutral, or is
13 unopposed to unemployment.

Unlike the 1402(g) statute

14 in Lee, which talks about being opposed to social
15 security benefits, this is a very neutral statute that
16 says — it doesn't say a recognized religious sect, like
17 in 1402(g).

18

It talks about a church.

3o what we have here is a very easily

19 identifiable category —

20

QUESTION;

Nevertheless, it does grant

21 benefits to certain kinds of religious organizations and

22 deny them to others, doesn't it?
23

SR. VESELY;

This is true.

You cannot

24 accommodate —
25

QUESTION;

Well, isn't that sort of abuse the

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 kind of thing that has lad us to suggest strict
2 scrutiny?
3

SR. VESELY*

Well, I think, Mr. Justice

4 Brennan, I think the situation is very analogous to the
5 Lea case again.

What difference under the First

6 Amendment does it make whether you have a self-employed
7 Amish or a non-self-employed Amish?

They have got to

8 have the same beliefs, you would have to come to the
9 conclusion.
10

‘

So why can you draw a line there and not draw

11 a line there?

I think there may be a question of

12 whether there’s a wiser line or a better line or
13 whatever.
14

That’s not for this Court to decide.
The sam£ thing like in the Braunfeld case.

15 You said that it didn’t have to decide that there was a
16 better solution than having a one lay off.
17

I think that it’s completely proper here and I

18 would ask you to reverse insofar as we challenge.

5 Catholic Bishop of Chicago, except for the matter of

6 legal connection with a church, which is in no sense a
7 commercial enterprise, and which virtually accepts no
8 kind of direct or indirect public subsidy, may such a
9 school be compelled to be involved in a governmental

10 program of which excessive entanglement between
11 government and religion is absolutely a necessary part?
12

QUESTIOBs

May I ask, Mr. Ball, are you going

13 to address the 1341 jurisdictional argument?

NR. BALLs

14

I am indeed, Mr. Justice Brennan.

15 I thought that my division of argument would necessarily
16 deal with the entanglement problem as a precedent to

17 discussing the jurisdictional problem, and then I would
18 go on to free exercise, and finally, if time permitted,

19 the equal protection question.
20

This Act involves two kinds of entanglements.

21 First of all, in the benefit eligibility determination
22 process —
23

'

QUESTIONS

Well, of course, if there is no

24 jurisdiction, iE there was no jurisdiction in the
25 district court you don’t get to entanglements, do you?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

SR. BALL*

Bell, I tell you, Mr. Chief

2 Justice, I think we get to the jurisdictional problem
3 through the entanglement problem.

May I explain that to

4 the Court?
5

The second kind of an entanglement is

6 entanglement relating to the ordinary administration of

7 the Act apart from the benefit eligibility determination
8 process.

Mow, to come to that.

9

In the benefit determination process, a

10 process which can arise at the very outset of

11 employment, because the employee may already have picked
12 up four quarters of work through another employer, the

13 governmental parties, as Mr. Vesely just made clear,
14 they say that religious ministries can avoid any
15 entanglement problem simply by establishing work rules,
16 requiring a teacher to conform to, as the reply brief of

17 the Government said, the principal’s interpretation of
18 doctrinal and moral matters.
19

At the trial, the United States through its

20 ova expert witnesses attempted then to provide a

21 showcase demonstration of how the work rule works.

But

22 as the testimony turned out, it became crystal-clear
23 that whether the kind of blank check agreement was used
24 which the Government had recommended in its reply brief,
25 namely the employee agrees that whatever the employer

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 says is doctrine and a proper code of conduct, that the
2 employee agrees to conform to, or whether it's a long,
3 spelled-out statement of faith with all manner of rules
4 of conduct and all the essential doctrines of faith
5 spelled out, either way, as Justice — Judge Mariana
6 Feltzer below said so accurately, the complexities of
7 religious faith are not reduceible to work rules,
8

Mote here that it’s perfectly clear that the

9 Government witnesses were completely

correct in saying,

10 this is how a benefit eligibility determination process
11 has to work

in any kind of employment, in any kind of

12 institution.

But these witnesses also conclusively

13 demonstrated

that when that process is applied to a

14 religious ministry,

it veritably explodes with potential

15 for entanglement.
16

We had example after example where Government

17 expert Ernest Carter,

for example, was called to the

18 stand by the Government and he was asked, suppose this
19 teacher entered into an understanding with

the school

20 that he or she was to observe a document called a
21 statement of Eaith, and that school discharges her on
22 the ground that she breached the statement of faith,
23 taught something contrary to it.
24 examiner
25

Would the hearing

examine what that agreement was?
Answer*

He would.

Well, the questioning

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

pursued, what if they disagree about what the doctrine

2 was?

The employer says, you breached it, and the

3

employee says, no, I didn’t.

4

examiner do in that case, the Government was asked?
Answer:

5

What does the hearing

Well, he, the state, has to weigh the

6 evidence from both parties and decide in favor of one or
7

the other, weigh the doctrine.
Government experts were asked about cases

8
9

where an employee is discharged for a decline in

10

religious fervor relating to the students, a very

11

important element in a religious school.

12

said*

13

and what that meant.

14

does, what harm that loss of zeal does to the employer.

I would have great difficulty in measuring zeal
But I would ask what harm that

Then the witness was asked, wall, who would

15
16

The witness

judge that, the claims examiner?

Answer*

Yes.

The implied work rule also came very much into

17
18

scope through the testimony of the Government

19

witnesses.

They were asked, does the hearing examiner

20 aver get into the question of whether a particular
21

implied work rule, a doctrine, a piece of the statement

22 of faith, for example, is reasonable or unreasonable?
23

Answer*

Yes, and whether it's enforced or

24

not, thus taking the state examiner into the whole life

25

of the institution in order to find out what is

35

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

enforced, and with whom, and when, and how often, and to

examination.

was because the schools in California

and there are

2 about 700 of them all told, of Christian schools of this
3

kind — were promptly set upon by the — by the

4

California unemployment compensation authorities in 1978

5

and they were told, you must now come under this program

6

and comply with it, a program to which they had not been

7

subject.
They had vigorous constitutional objections to

8

9 this on free exercise grounds and on entanglement
10

grounds, which they very strongly raised.

11

question became then one of whether they must go under

12

the program and start to pay under protest for something

13

that they had very little money to pay for to begin

14

with, use stewardship funds on a program that they

15

believed was flatly unconstitutional, or whether they

could go into a federal district court and have federal

SR. BALL;

Ho, I don’t, Justice O'Connor, and

the reason that I don’t is partially the reason I have

1

stated hers, that the potential of entanglement was

2 immediate, that the bsnefit determination eligibility
3

process could be promptly upon the school.

4

be thrust into that almost immediately.

They could

There was another reason that was back of the

5

6 move into federal court, and that was the fact that the
7

Secretary of Labor had laid down a rule that only those

8 schools which were totally religious, in his view, would
9

be considered exempt under the statute, whose plain

10

wording was that church schools were exempt.

He said

11

that if they were not strictly religious then they would

12

not be exempt, and therefore investigators from the

13

State of California went to religious schools throughout

14

the state with a tabular list, trying to figure out

15

which of their functions were secular and which were

16

religious.

17

And this occurred to these religious schools

18

we represent here today on this appeal, as well as the

19

church schools.

20

So for all these reasons, the very imminence

1 only partially religious, under the state and Federal
2 Government's view, you have to pay the tax.
3

MR. BALL;

No.

The inquiry is relevant for

4 this reason, Justice Stevens;

The -- under Secretary —

5 if you're referring now to Secretary Marshall's initial
6 pronouncement that his people were to determine what was
7 strictly religious and what was not in all schools which
8 claimed to be religious —

9

QUESTION;

That included category one and

10 category two schools?

11

MR. BALL;

It would definitely include

12 category three schools.

13

QUESTION;

Yes, but the only problem, as I can

14 see it anyway, would be with respect to category one and
15 category two schools.

If you're in category three, you

16 must pay the tax whether you're entirely religious or

17 only partially religious.
18

MR. BALL;

You would be, except for the fact

19 — that's correct, in determining whether you come under
20 the statute.

But the category three schools were

21 especially interested in all of the problem of religious
22 entanglement and imposition on free exercise that they

23 felt the program embraced.
24

And so, when I was referring to why all the

25 plaintiffs went into court to seek the declaratory and

6

QUESTION;

Hr. Ball, may I get back just a

7 moment to this jurisdictional question.

I gather you

8 and the Government have a different position about

9 that.

As I understood Mrs. Shapiro, the Federal

10

Government’s position is that, no, the district court

11

had no jurisdiction, it was barred by 1341, but that

12

this Court had jurisdiction under 1252.

13

Tour position, I gather, is that, no, 1341 was

14

inapplicable because there was no plain, speedy, and

15

efficient remedy under state law; is that it?

16

HR. BALL;

Precisely.

You have that difference with the

Federal Government?

In our own case, we believed that the federal

10

What’s your authority for that?

11

BR. BALL;

Oh, Cantwell versus Connecticut,

12 virtually every free exercise case speaks of fundamental
13 liberties protected by the First Amendment which are not
14 in the same class as property rights or business rights
15 or commercial rights, et cetera.
16

QUESTION*

Well, you think that due process of

17 law guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment is
18 subordinate to these rights you’re talking about?
19

BR. BALL*

Not subordinate.

I think these

20 rights are a part of due process, but they're a part of
21 due process in its most vital and sensitive area, namely
22 freedom of the mind, freedom of religion, freedom of
23 speech and press.

Those liberties I had thought the

24 Court had long since said were preferred freedoms and
25 not at all to be classified with property rights.

MR. BALL:

— such as Wisconsin versus Yoder,

ever so many cases in which the Court has declared for

We took quite literally what the Court had had

17

to say about the enormous dangers of the potential for

18

entanglement between religious activity and Government,

19

and we think that here the record is very clear that in

20 the administrative proceedings which are inevitable in
21

this case, in those administrative proceedings, in the

22 benefit eligibility determination process, serious
23

constitutional damage would result to the religious

25

And this would be continued if the

issues we’ve been talking about, the statement of faith,

And then when you get to the state court level
finally, you really get a sort of posthumous result.

8 The state court can simply say, well, yes, the

QUESTION:

An argument much like yours was

3 male in Henderson against Wallace and someone else, that
4 is, that the very inquiry in the pretrial discovery as
5 to what information the media had which they didn't
6 disclose was a "entanglement" type of thing, which
7 couldn’t be made.

But this Court rejected that

8 argument.
9

The courts must always make the initial

10 inquiry, even if it involves some entanglement.
11 Otherwise,

the claim of entanglement would be a barrier

12 to any inquiry under the true facts.
13

MR. BALL:

The kind of entanglement, Mr. Chief

14 Justice, that we’re speaking of here is the entanglement
15 by a claims examiner who is not empowered to deal with
16 constitutional issues and who, as the record so
17 abundantly shows, will be taking upon himself
18 examination into matters of doctrine, faith, moral
19 conduct,

20

religious fervor, and all of those things.

21 situation that you pose.

23 against Landow and Wallace — is the title of the case.

Then I’m puzzled where we are, say,

23E3TIDSs

It's in quite a different setting.

MR. BALL*

It is with respect to labor

It

6 seems to me the Court in Catholic Bishop attached an
7 appendix to its opinion in which it showed that a
8 certain Monsignor O'Donnell had been discussing liturgy
9 and asking questions about Catholic liturgy.

And these

10 ware, I thought, shown by the Court to be an example of
11 an area into which the state ought not be going,

12 irrespective of whether it is in a labor situation or
13 whatever situation it might be.
14

Be also dealt with the problem of free

15 exercise, and I'll touch briefly upon that, only to say
16 that we believe that there is a marked contrast here to
17 Lee, to Braunfeld, and to Murdoch and Fallett.
18

In contrast to Lae, here a religious activity

19 is being taxed, and indeed a prime religious activity,

20 namely a ministry of teaching.

Mr. Lae never claimed

21 that making a profit by hiring six or seven employees to
22 produce rough lumber or commercial housing was a
23 religious activity.
24

In contrast to Braunfeld, we have here a tax.

25 In contrast to inferences in Murdoch and Fallett that a

52
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

preacher is not entitled to be free from taxes, here the

2 tax is not on anybody’s personal income, but on the most

3 sensitive aspect, the most sensitive aspect of a school
4 ministry, namely the employment relationship between
5 teachers and the school administration itself.
The Government has put squarely to the Court,

6

7 it seems to me, the proposition that religious activity
8 may be taxed.

And no Aesopian language about relatively

9 small amounts or indirect burdens changes that very
10

stark reality, and no compelling state interest

11

certainly exists for imposing this tax on Redwood

12

Christian Schools and the Christian Schools of San

13 Diego.
A broad exception already substantially exists

14

15 in the statutes as they are, a very, very broad
16 exception, not a narrow exception, to which the
17 exception of the church — of the non-church schools
18 adds but very, very slightly.

All schools until 1978

19 were exempt, and therefore one must inquire, what's the
20 compelling state interest now in saying that these
21

non-church schools are subject to the tax.

22

NS. SHAPIRO;

Well, only to state that the

2 adequacy of'the state remedy issue is essentially the
3 argument that you can't trust a state court to pass on
4 federal constitutional issues, which we think is quite
5 incorrect.
6

QUESTION:

Well, isn’t there another problem,

7 just to gat your view on it.

What about whan the

8 Government is made a party and then removes the case to
9 the federal court?

How can the state remedy be adequate

10 then?
11

NS. SHAPIRO;

Well, the state remedy is

12 certainly entirely adequate as far as the plaintiffs
13 here, the schools, are concerned, because they can get
14 -* I mean, the only tax that’3 involved in this case,
15 because in this particular —
16

QUESTION;

But unless you take the view that

17 the court necessarily decided the federal constitutional
18 question, which would make you a proper party, we don’t
19 have jurisdiction

20

as a matter of statutory law.

HS. SHAPIRO;

21 constitutional question,

They decided the federal
because the state statute

22 tracks the federal statute.
23

QUESTION;

24 appropriate party
25

Then wasn’t the United States an

and unable to remove?

NS. SHAPIRO;

They certainly were an

55

1 appropriate party, but they were not a necessary party,
2 because there's no feieral tax here, because there isn't
3 any federal tax on these non-profit schools.

There's

4 only a state tax here, and in the state courts you could
5 get — the schools could get a complete remedy as far as
6 that issue is concerned.
7

The only other point I wanted to make is on

8 the entanglement issue.

The record does indicate that

9 the state — the federal witnesses were asked a lot of
10 hypotheticals.

But the point is that in those

11 hypotheticals the guestion assumed that there was not an
12 appropriate work rule.

What we're talking about is not

13 a discharge for religious reasons, but a discharge for a
14 violation of the work rule, and the work rule — you
15 ion *t have to have any inquiry into the religious
16 doctrine of the school, of the church.
17

What the work rule would require would be that

18 the teacher would follow the directions of the principal
19 or whoever was in charge in teaching, similar to any

20 secular schools.

The teachers are supposed to follow

21 the directions of those in charge of the curriculum.
22 And if they did not, then that would be misconduct.
23

fou don't get into questions of what's the

24 correct doctrine or any real religious questions.
25

3’JESTIONs

I suppose, however, Mrs. Shapiro,

57

there may be some state requirement that work rules be

2 reasonable, and to that extent might not you have to get

3 into —
MS. SHAPIRO:

4

Hall, the stata requirement that

5 the work rules be reasonable means reasonable on the
6 context of the employment.

The witness explained that

7 it wouldn’t be reasonable to have a work rule that
8 required,

the example was a mechanic who was required

9 not to drink off tha job.
10
11

QUESTION:

Yes, but to the extent that they

dealt with religious requirements, to that limited

12 extent, it seems to me that it might put the thing in

13 the posture of an examination of doctrine.
14

MS. SHAPIRO:

I believe that, given a

15 secondary, a primary or secondary school with a strong
16 religious orientation, if the schools says our work
17 rules require you to lead a Christian life as that is
18 defined by the principal, and the teacher accepted the
19 job on that understanding, then that would be a
20 reasonable work rule.
21

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, counsel.

22

The case is submitted.

23

(Whereupon, at 2:03 p.m., the case in the

24 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
