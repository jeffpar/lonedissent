PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE EURGER:

We will hear arguments now

3 in Karine Bank against Samuel Weaver et ux.
4

Kr. Killer, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

5

KR. KILLER:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it please

6 the Court:
7

This case involves two separate and distinct

8 instruments:

one, an FDIC-insured certificate of deposit in

9 the amount of $50,000 bearing interest at 7 1/2 percent and
10 maturing in six years; secondly, an agreement between a loan
11 customer of the bank and a guarantor of the customer's loan
12 to the bank about which the bank had no knowledge at the
13 time the loan was made.
14

Petitioner Karine Bank requests that the Court

15 reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court which found that
16 both instruments were securities within the meaning of the
17 definitions of the
18

'33 and '34 Acts.

The FDIC-insured certificate of deposit is not

19 specifically mentioned as an enumerated item in the '33 and
20 '34 Act definitions.

However, the Circuit Court of Appeals

21 applied several tests;

one, the "any note" test; and

22 secondly, whether it was an investment contract.
23

In the investment contract issue, the Howey case

24 decided by this Court clearly establishes what the test is
25 and has been since 1946, and that test was further

elaborated upon by this Court in the Tcherepnin case cited a

2 few years later; and that test being a document is a
3

security if it's a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a

4

person invests money in a common enterprise with the profits

5

to come solely from the efforts of others.

6
7

We believe that that test has been misapplied by
the Circuit Court, and there are three Circuit Court

8 decisions, in the Fourth, Fifth and Seven Circuits;
9

the

Burrus case in the Fourth, the Bellah case in the Fifth, and

10

the Fingland case in the Seventh, which hold that

11

certificates of deposit are not securities within the

12

meaning of those cases of this Court.

The statutes say unless the

14

context otherwise requires any note and so forth.

MR. MILLER;

Yes, he is.
Without reprimand?
He has not been reprimanded, to my

16 knowledge.
17

I believe the Third Circuit erred in its analogy

18 calling this an investment contract.

The Tcherepnin case

19 held there was no voting — the fact of whether there is or
20 is not a voting right connected with
21 important.

the instrument is

In Tcherepnin that was a savings and loan

22 certificate which contained the element of

voting.

The CD

23 contains no element of voting.
24

QUESTION;

Well, are you saying that in Tcherepnin

25 the thing was more like a share of capital stock?
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Ann Virginia a\/p s w Washington n r. onnoA to

1

MR. MILLER;

Yes.

2 in a savings and loan.

It was more like an investment

The savings and loan had no other

3 investment vehicle other than selling shares or investment
4 certificates as they were called in Tcherepnin.

But in this

5 case the bank has, of course, capital stock issued pursuant
6 to the Pennsylvania banking laws,

which is where the

7 investment would be in this case.
QUESTION;

8

And you don’t question that would be a

9 security.
MR. MILLER;

10
11

That certainly is a security.

The

legislative history of the enactment of the '33, I believe,

12 and

'34 Acts, in the congressional hearings one of the

13 representatives of the banking industry clearly said that
14 the stock of a national bank would be an investment.
15

In looking at this you might think of it as to

16 whether it's a commercial instrument or an investment
17 instrument.

We believe that commercial instruments are not

18 covered by the securities definitions and investment
19 instruments are.
20

21

Legislatively, the *33 and '34 Acts were part of a
package of acts that were enacted in those years and which

22 regulated banking in several respects.

One was the

23 Glass-Steagall Act and another was the FDIC Act.
24

Now, those acts provided a parallel system of

25 regulation of banking in this country, that is to say,
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

federally regulated banking institutions, through the FDIC

2 or the comptroller of the currency.

The legislative history

3 of the Glass-Steagall Act shows that there was an attempt
4 when it was passed to separate banking from investment
5 activities.

And the Third Circuit, we believe, erred in

6 blurring that distinction and putting it back together agan.

7

The Respondent Weaver does have a remedy.

The

8 Pennsylvania Securities Act, as referenced in the complaint

9 of the Respondent filed in the District Court, does claim
10 account under the Pennsylvania
11

Securities Act where there is

essentially the same language as rule 10b-5.

Also, there is

12 a Pennsylvania common law fraud count alleged.

Both of

13 those are pendant claims, and so there is a state court
14 remedy in this case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. CONNER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

23

MR. CONNER;

24

To understand this case, the posture of this case,

25

Good morning.

is to understand some of the factual background.

I think

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S W

WASHINGTON D O 90094 f909^ 554-234S

1

simply stated, Sam and Alice Weaver go to the bank at the

2 bank's request in early March of

1978.

They have acquired a

3 $50,000 certificate of deposit a couple weeks ago prior to
4 them going into the bank.

They've already been solicited to

5 make an investment in the Columbus business by the bank, and
6

in early March of 1978 they in effect traded the certificate

7 of deposit, the $50,000 certificate of deposit they had,
8 which was of a maturity of six years, which you undoubtedly

9 understand is critical because it gets it outside the
10 exception within the
11

'34 or the

'33 Act that has the nine

month exclusion, and they traded that for this particular

12 agreement,

that is, an investment position in the Columbus

13 business.
14

All of these events occurred within a couple days

15 of each other or a couple weeks of each other, and one was
16 the consideration for the other; in other words, they trade
17 their certificate of deposit for the right to obtain the
18 profits from Columbus.
19

A critical thing here in the bank's involvement is

20 that the bank induced this transaction for their own

21

benefit, and the reason why it was to their own benefit is

22 that they in effect were a

23 unprotected at the time.

risk lender to Columbus and
And the reason why they were

24 unprotected is they forgot to file their equipment liens
25 properly in the right county; so in effect they had a
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

$30,000 or $40,000 loan outstanding that they couldn’t

2 collect.

Columbus is insolvent at the time.

Columbus is

3 overdrawn at this bank in the checking account; in other
4 words, there is a checking account and they’re overdrawn.

I

5 think the record indicates way back in '77 that they had
6 been overdrawn; they had been overdrawn continuously.

The

7 bank kept on honoring their checks to keep them afloat, if
8

you will, to keep Columbus afloat so that they could stay in

9 business, so that they could figure out a remedy to this
10

problem, because the bank couldn't collect on their loans

11

because they hadn’t perfected their equipment.
So as a consequence of that, they had told

12

13 Columbus, Mr. Piccirillo, to go get an investor, and they
14 introduced — that is. Hr. Piccirillo introduced Mr. Heaver
15 to the bank because the bank in effect was approving whoever
16 was going to get in business with Mr. Piccirillo, and Mr.
17 Weaver in February of 1978 refused to get involved in the
18 business.

He refused.

He said it was too risky; he didn't

19 know Columbus’ financial status.
20
21

So what happened was then the bank, realizing that
Mr. Weaver was going to be the way that they could enhance

22 their position, that is, that they could get their overdrawn

23 checking account solved and get the loans taken care of,
24 went out and actively went after Mr. Weaver to get involved
25 in Columbus.

And they solicited him out at his farm, and
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S W

WASHINGTON D C 90094 (909^ SR4-934K

1

they finally persuaded him to come in with his certificate

2 of deposit and pledge it; and they told him that if he

3 pledged the certificate of deposit, they would loan Columbus
4 $65,000, and all or substantially all the $65,000 would go
5 for working capital.
6 a safe investment.

This was perceived by Mr. Weaver to be
It was perceived by Mr. Weaver to be

7 safe for many reasons, one of which was the fact that the
8 bank told Mr.

Weaver that in fact the bank had filed proper

9 liens against Columbus1 equipment, and they were protected,
10 and

they had sufficient collateral to protect Mr. Weaver.
Those three statements, affirmative statements by

11

12 the bank were false.

13 $65,000.

They weren't going to lend Columbus

They were going to take the $65,000, just as they

14 did in this case, and pay themselves off, leaving little or
15 no money for Columbus.

And the second and third statements

16 were false, that is, that they had perfected liens, because
17 they filed them in the wrong county.

It's a quirk here.

18 Columbus is right on the county line between Erie County and
19 Warren County, and the bank's main office is in Erie County;
20 and in any case they filed the equipment liens in the wrong
21

county so they were unprotected.

That was false, and the

22 third statement was false, the third representation, that

23 there was sufficient assets there that if anything went
24 wrong with the loan that Weaver would collect.
25

Now, perceiving that to be a safe investment and a
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

safe transaction, that’s what Hr. Weaver in effect did.

He

2 came in, he pledged it, and a couple days prior to that he

3 had agreed to take this profit-sharing agreement with
4 Columbus.
5

Now, you’ve got to understand the fact that there

6 is absolutely no question we're here under a rule 56

motion

7 for summary judgment, and the facts are to be construed
8 favorably to the Weavers.

9 Sam is over 80 now.

The Weavers are elderly people.

And to reasonably expect that he was

10 going to actively participate in this business, a
11

slaughterhouse business, which is hard physical labor, for

12 generating profits is

just unrealistic.

And those facts are

13 to be construed in our favor.
14

Now —

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. CONNER:

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Conner.
Yes, sir.
Supposing the Weavers had simply come

18 in and purchased a $50,000 certificate of deposit and then
19 later been dissatisfied or thought there were fraudulent
20 misrepresentations in connection with it, would you contend
21
22

that was a security?
MR. CONNER:

I would say that it was literally

23 within the Act, but in the context of that transaction may
24 not be a security.

The distinguishing factor in this case

25 is it is a secondary transaction that we’re complaining
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

about.

He are not complaining about the original issuance

2 of the certificate of deposit, and this distinguishes many
3
4
5

of the cases that have been decided in this particular field.
We're complaining about the second transaction,
that is, the transaction which was — the transaction in

6 which he trades that position for an investment position.
7

And I think there’s a distinction between the primary

8 issuance situation and the secondary transaction.
9

I think in the primary issuance transaction it may

10

literally fall within the note or bond, or if you're within

11

the '33 Act within the term "evidence of indebtedness."

12

within the context of that particular issuance, it may not

13

be a security transaction.

14

But in the secondary transaction — and we've

15

cited the case with Reason v. Bank of Miami drawas that

16

distinction, which is a Fifth Circuit case.

Mr. Conner, I asked your opposition

MR. CONNER;

A state claim has been filed, but

23

there is a statute of limitations problems there

24

specifically because there is a one-year statute for

25

security violations in Pennsylvania.

And in this particular

case we have a pendant state court claim attached to the

2 federal claim, and the motion for summary judgment in this
3

case was not filed until the eve of trial, which was a

4

couple years after the events here; and hence, we would be

5

late with regard to any securities violation in the state

court even though it's been filed.

We have a procedure in

defense is a good one?

13

MR. CONNER:

I'm not conceding that.
But you haven't pursued the state claim.
We have not pursued the state claim,

14

that's correct.

As you undoubtedly know, in this particular

15

case the Third Circuit had directed the District Court to

16

hear the pendant state court claims in this particular

17

case.

18

particular case was to hear the pendant state court claims.

I didn’t

Yes, sir.
Are they, too, subject to a statute of

MR. CONNER:

Well, not in this particular case

18

they wouldn’t be if they were resolved by the District Court

because they were timely pled with the original federal

20 securities claim.
21

QUESTION:

In other words, if they were decided as

statute of limitation.

MR. CONNER:

this case were filed timely.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. CONNER:

6

The pendant state court claims in

Yes.
The problem was that after the

statute had expired in the state court proceedings and just

7 on the eve of the trial of

this particular case, the court

8 granted summary judgment on the entire case.

And the

9 District Court in this particular case dismissed not only
10 the federal securities claim and also dismissed the pendant

11

state court claim.
Now, going to the question of the certificate of

12

13 deposit made reference to by the bank in this particular
14 case,
15 hold
16

I think that a change, that is, if the Court were to
that a certificate of deposit is not a security, that

that would be a change in the law as opposed to the

17 contrary.

And the reason why I said that is this.

Counsel, has the SEC ever changed its

MR. CONNER;

To my knowledge they have not, and to

my knowledge the best answer that I can give to you with

6 regard to that is that the SEC in various cases have
7

appeared amicus taking various positions on whether or not a

8 CD in the context of a transaction is a security.
9

For

example, in the Meason case v. Bank of Miami they appeared

10

amicus, and in that case it was a secondary transaction.

11

They contended it was a security within these acts.

think that in the Burrus case that after — there was a

But they say

they say specifically that it's

this transaction and not a question

10 whether or not in other cases,

And I would say

because they’re very careful

to say that in other cases they may take a different

QUESTION;

13

I thought I said that about the

14 contract.

MR. CONNER;

15

No, sir.

They said that with regard

16 to the CD.

One other thing that I think the Court should be

17

18 aware of is the fact that the opposition

has indicated that

19 the fact that the certificate of deposit is not mentioned
20 specifically in the definition,
21

that that would indicate

that because it's not mentioned specifically and/or because

22 they mention the word
23 security,

"certificate of deposit" for a

which we acknowledge is a different instrument,

24 that that would be some indication

that a certificate of

25 deposit was not meant to be literally within the act.

1

This Court in Joiner in a very similar issue

2 specifically held that that type of analysis was incorrect.

3 There is a reference to oil leases, for example, in Joiner,
4 and the question was whether or not a divided interest in
5 oil leases as opposed to an undivided interest in oil leases
6 was a security.

And the Court held that just because they

7 were making reference in the statute to an undivided
8 interest and that they did not mention a divided interest,

9 that that did not mean that the divided interest was held to
10

be or would be held to be a security.

11

held.

12

Now —

13

QUESTION;

In fact, the Court so

Mr. Conner, let me call your attention

14 to page 6 of the Government's brief here where they say at
15 the end of the first full paragraph, the conclusion that the
16 certificate of deposit involved here is not a security
17 subject to the antifraud provisions of the federal
18 securities law harmonizes the federal securities and banking
19 laws and avoids overlapping jurisdiction that would "serve
20 no general purpose," citing our Daniel case.
21

Now, I had taken that as a fairly explicit

22 statement of their position.

23

MR. CONNER;

Your Honor, my understanding is on

24 page 6, if you'll see that the -- right down at the bottom
25 of paragraph 2 it says, "examination" — excuse me.

I'm

1

2

sorry
My understanding is that in the brief here — and

3 I have lost the particular point where they have said this
4 -- that in this particular brief they so indicate that they
5 did not want it held for all purposes.
6

QUESTION;

Well, on page 22 I thought the

7 Government’s position was that where you have a regulated
8

bank you just don’t treat CDs as securities.

They didn't

9 want any general rule about certificates generally in
10 unregulated areas.
11

But with respect to a bank that’s

regulated, I thought they just said put it aside; the other

12 laws will take care of this, not the securities laws.

13

Is that right or not?

14

MR. CONNER;

I don’t think that’s right.

15 think that that's their position.

I don’t

I think that -- because

16 that would be inconsistent with the SEC's position in other
17 cases, and specifically the Bank of Miami case that's so
18 recent, because they are -19

QUESTION;

Well, that may be, that may be, but

That just

Then it says, "The

22 foregoing analysis, however, may not necessarily apply in

23 other contexts."
24

MR. CONNER;

And they say, "The better reasoned

25 decisions of the lower court did not view the question of

whether a certificate of deposit is a security in the

2 abstract."

3

QUESTIONS

I know, but I thought their position

4 was if you're dealing with a regulated bank, the answer is
5 clear.
6

NR. CONNER*

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. CONNER:

Well, I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Okay.
My understanding is that they are not

9 taking that firm a position, because obviously certificates
10 of deposit can be traded in all sorts of secondary

11

transactions.

12 think

And I think that they recognize that, and I

that if they came out hard and fast that there would

13 be all sorts of secondary transactions; and we just differ
14 on the facts in this particular secondary transaction as to
15 whether or not it formed a consideration for an investment
16 position.
17

QUESTION;

What are the practical advantages of

18 proceeding under the Act as opposed to in the state causes
19 of action?
20

MR. CONNER;

Well, one primary practical advantage

21 is the fact that in the securities law,
22 case or the

that is, in the 10b

17 case, it includes omissions, as opposed to

23 commissions; that is, situations where a party fails to
24 disclose, as would apply to this particular case, Your
25 Honor.

It would apply to a situation where the
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE . S.W

WASHINGTON D C. 90094 (909* 5H4-934K

1

misrepresentation was purely misrepresentation by silence,

2

where they failed to tell people something.

3

In this case there is that element in that.

They

4 failed to tell the Weavers, for example, in this case that
5 Columbus was insolvent and was going to be insolvent even
6

though they went through this loan transaction.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. CONNER:

And under state law?
They may not be a cause of action

9 under the common law of Pennsylvania, because the common law
10 draws a narrower line with
11
12

regard to what is an actionable

f ra ud .
I think, the distinguishing factor with regard to

13 this secondary transaction, we differ from the Government
14 because I don't think the Government analyzes the facts in
15 this particular case to identify that the bank specifically
16 identified Weaver as an investor.

They in their testimony

17 in this case specifically identified Weaver as an investor
18 as opposed to a guarantor or proposed guarantor.
19 he was an investor, one.
20 an investment transaction.

They said

Two, they said that he was making
They testified to that in their

21 pretrial depositions — and we’re entitled to the benefit or
22 favorable construction of that — and said

that.

23 said that he was just acting as a guarantor.

They never

And thirdly,

24 they specifically identified the amount of his investment as
25 being $50,000, and they so stated in the record in this
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

particular case.

2

Now, separate and apart from the certificate of

3 deposit issue is the related issue of the Piccirillo
4 agreement, as to whether or not that constitutes a security
5 within the securities law.

And we would submit that it fits

6 within any one of the one, two, or three definitions within

7 the subspecies of security such as profit-sharing agreement,
8 certificate of interest, or in fact an investment contract.

9 And the Court has laid down three basic guidelines as to
10

whether or not a particular agreement constitutes an

11

investment contracti

12

of money, whether or not it’s a common enterprise, and

whether or not you have an investment

13 whether or not there’s a reasonable expectation of profits
14 from the efforts of others.
15

And I think clearly in this case that we meet all

16 of the elements.

There is no question about it that there's

17 a $50,000 investment.

The bank in fact so stated that that

18 was a channel which the money was being channeled into
19 Columbus.

And there's little question that on the facts of

20 this case that the profits could be expected from
21

efforts of Piccirillo and not Weaver.

the

There’s absolutely no

22 evidence that he was going to do anything that was going to

23 contribute to the profits in this case.
24

The bank argues that it's not a common enterprise,

25 but the $50,000 investment of Mr. Weaver gets pooled.

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

They

1

say there is no pooling.

2 assets of Columbus.
3

It's in fact pooled with the

It’s no separated.

It's co-mingled.

There's also another question about whether or not

4

in this particular case, considering the bank is in an

5

unsecured position, their assets are pooled there, too.

6

there were other people who were loaning money, the original

7

seller of the business.

8
9
10
11

And

So if there is a question about just multiplicity
of investors on a vertical standpoint as opposed to —
horizontal, excuse me, as opposed to a vertical standpoint -QUESTION:

Mr. Conner, may I ask you a question?

12

If one owned farmlands and leased the lands to a farmer, the

13

compensation to be a division of profits or a share of the

14

profits under the lease arrangement, would that be analogous

15

to the contract you are discussing here this morning?

16
17
18

MR. CONNER:

That is, the landowner leases it to

the farmer?
QUESTION:

Yes.

And the compensation to the

19

landowner is a share in the profits, a very common

20

a rrangement.

21

MR. CONNER:

That may be.

I think there's a

22 distinction, and the distinction is —
23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CONNER:

25

What is the distinction?
The distinction is that in our case

we are contributing — we are making a — providing capital

QUESTION;

What about the land in the example I

put ?

MR. CONNER:

don't get the certificate of deposit back if the business

6

fails.

7

land back.

We lose it, where the owner of the land gets the
He has not made an investment at risk like Mr.

8 Weaver does in this particular case.
9

QUESTION;

Suppose the lease is for ten years?

MR. CONNER:

10

There would be certain leasehold

11

rights, that he would have the right, assuming that there is

12

a written lease, he would have certain rights to take the

13

land back.

14

that he would get his land back, and he does not make the

15

commitment that an investor makes when he provides capital

16

at risk that Mr. Weaver does in this particular case.

17

Eventually he gets — Your Honor, I would submit

This particular case, the only chance he's going

18

to get his deposit back is if in fact Columbus has

19

sufficient working capital to make it.

20
21

QUESTION;

In the example I put, the owner of the

land might receive no profits whatever for years.

22

MR. CONNER;

23

QUESTION:

That's a possibility, yes, sir.
Well, supposing — to modify Justice

24

Powell's example a little bit — supposing in addition to

25

the arrangement with the tenant who would work the land and
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

provide a profit, they then pledged or mortgaged the land to

2 the bank and borrowed the working capital to buy the farm

3 equipment.

Then I suppose you’d have the same case,

4 wouldn't you?
5
6

MR. CONNER:

You’re getting closer to that

particular case, and I’m sure that you can draw arrangements

7 that get closer and closer to this particular situation.
8

And I think that we meet all of the elements.

The Court

9 said they were not dealing with a full record in this
10

particular case, and the question before the Third Circuit

11

was not whether or not after a full trial whether or not we

12 had met the full definitions of an investment contract or a

13 profit-sharing agreement or a certificate of interest, if
14 you will, but whether or not there was a genunine issue of
15 fact as to whether or not we met those requirements.
16

And we would submit that on the record before that

17 court and on the record before this Court there’s certainly
18 an issue of fact.
19

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that to make the

20 investment contract aspect of this case a security you must
21

have as a part of the overall transaction a pledge of the

22 certificate of deposit?

23

MR. CONNER*

That’s correct. Your Honor.

See, the

24 original idea of this whole transaction was Mr. Weaver was
25 just going to give Piccirillo $50,000, and then he backed
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE

S W

WASHINGTON D O 90094 I?09* S54-934S

1

off because of the risk involved, and the bank became

2 concerned and

went back and told, well, listen, there is a

3 less riskier way of doing this* you give us the $50,000 CD,
4 we will loan the business $65,000.

And the bank was doing

5 that, you see, because that was the only way at that point
6 that they could solve their own problems.

And from Weaver's

7 standpoint it seemed like a relatively safe investment,
8 because he sees somebody who he trusts,

the bank, and

9 they're telling him that they have the equipment protected,
10 that they're going
11

to give him $65,000, and the bank

themselves said that Piccirillo needed $10,000 to make it,

12 and the bank knew that he wasn't going to get $10,000.

13 got $3,800 out of a $65,000 loan.

He

Now, there was just no

14 possible way that Columbus was going to make it; that they
15 were headed for insolvency or bankruptcy irrespective of
16 this loan transaction.
17

QUESTION:

Well, if the bank had made

18 misrepresentations about this company and convinced the
19 people to make a loan directly to the company, same result?
20 Say you took back a note from the company.
21

MR. CONNER:

Certainly the courts have held that

22 risky loans, a long-term loan at risk is a security.

The

23 Second Circuit specifically, I believe in the Zeller case
24 that's made reference to in the briefs, has indicated that
25 long-term loans like that are securities.
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION*

So any note issued by a borrower may be

2 a security?
3

MR. CONNER*

No, no.

I didn't say that.

I'm

sorry.

5

paying it back is a profit situation, and that was the only

6 chance in this case.
7

The only chance that Weaver was going

to get his certificate of deposit back is in fact if

8 Columbus somehow was going to make it.
9

And so we would submit that whether you call it an

10

investment contract or whether you call it a profit-sharing

11

agreement or a certificate of interest, that there is at

12

least under rule 56 a factual issue that would allow a court

13

or jury to make a conclusion that investment contracts or

14

one of these other subspecies in fact exist.

We would submit that the Third Circuit is correct,

22 that there are factual support for our position that the

Piccirillo agreement is a profit-sharing agreement or a

certificate of interest or investment contract; that in this

25

particular case the Third Circuit is also correct that the

2 made by an investor for investment purposes, that it was in

3 fact a sale.

This particular court held in the Rubin case

4 that even though it was a loan transaction, the person got
5 convicted under section 17 when they made a pledge, and that
6 was just as much a commercial loan as this particular case.

7 And if it applies in a criminal case, then it certainly
8 would apply in a civil case.
