ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. CLARK HODGSON, JR., ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. HODGSON;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

10 the Court, my client's petition to this Court raises for
11 review the question of whether or not taxpayers who are
12 unable to meet the criteria of Flast against Cohen and any
13 other Article III decision of this Court will nonetheless be
14 able to challenge the transfer of federal surplus property.
15

This, in short, is an Article III case.

16 an establishment clause case.

It is not

The constitutional and

17 statutory context is outlined by Article IV, Section 3,
18 Clause 2 of the Constitution, which is called the property
19 clause.

Under that clause Congress has the power to dispose

20 of territory or other property belonging to the United
21 States.

The Federal Property and Administrative Services

22 Act of 1949 was enacted pursuant to that power, and creates
23 a comprehensive program for federal property disposal,
24 particularly property which is surplus, that is, property no
25 longer needed by the United States.

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The statute confers upon agencies of the executive

2 branch a variety of options for property disposal, including
3 the sale or lease to health or educational institutions.
4 Sale may be for cash, but the Act requires that the
5 Secretary consider any public benefit accruing to the United
6 States as a result of the sale, and an educational
7 institution may be entitled to a reduction in the purchase
8 price computed on the basis of benefits which may accrue to
9 the United States for the use of the property by that
10 institution.

The regulations refer to that reduction as a

11 public benefit allowance.
12

Now, for the first time in the 32-year history of

13 this Act, a program over which Congress has given exclusive
14 if not plenary power under Article IV is subject to attack
15 and the intervention of the judicial process.
16

This particular transfer, the Valley Forge General

17 Hospital, originally about a 181 acre tract slightly outside
18 the city of Philadelphia,
19 1942.

was acquired by the government in

It served the military as a hospital facility for

20 nearly 30 years.

In

1974, by order of the Secretary of

21 Defense, the facility was closed.

The Secretary states

22 reasons of declining work force and economy as the reasons
23 for the closure of the facility.
24

As is required by the Federal Property and

25 Administrative Services Act, the following four steps took

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 place.

First, the military departments determined that it

2 was excess to their needs and the needs of the United States
3 Coast Guard.

Secondly, Congressional clearance was sought

4 and obtained from the Armed Services Committee of both
5 Houses.

Thirdly, the General Services Administration, after

6 notifying all other Federal agencies and all other branches
7 of the government of the availability of this facility,
8 reported that there was no need, and it was declared under
9 the statute surplus to the needs of the federal government.
10

Finally, it was assigned to the Secretary of the

11 Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for disposition
12 to a health or educational institution.

My client, Valley

13 Forge Christian College, applied for a portion of the tract,
14 and was ultimately selected to receive 77 acres and some
15 personal property.

The value of the surplus facility was

16 $577,000.
17

The government, in connection with this sale,

18 allowed a 100 percent public benefit allowance based in part
19 upon my client's promises and representations to continue
20 the broadening of its offerings in the arts and humanities
21 and otherwise strengthen its academic position, conferring
22 benefits upon members of the public.
23

In August of 1976, a deed was executed by the

24 government transferring the real estate to my client.

The

25 deed included restrictive covenants which forbid the college

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 from utilizing the property for anything other than
2 educational purposes and some other restrictions, and
3 included in the government the right at any time within 30
4 years to revert the title back to the Department in the
5

event of a breach of these conditions.

6

In the fall of 1976, as a result of a news release

7 that was issued following this transfer, Americans United,
8 the organization, and four paid employees on its executive
9 staff filed a lawsuit in the district court seeking a
10 recision of the transaction, thereby effectively ousting my
11 client from its college campus.
After limited pretrial discovery, the district

12
13

court dismissed the complaint, finding that none of the

14

plaintiffs could comply with the standing criteria of Flast

15

against Cohen, and further holding that their complaint

16

alleged no more than a generalized grievance about the

17

conduct of government.
The United States Court of Appeals unanimously

18
19

agreed with the lower court's finding that these taxpayers

20 could not meet the Flast criteria, but nevertheless
21

reversed.

The majority opinion of the Third Circuit

22 launched an unsupportable test for establishment clause
23

standing, wherein standing is now to be predicated upon the

24

violation of the shared, individuated right that each

25

citizen has to a government that obeys its Constitution.

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

Did the Third Circuit make any effort

2 to distinguish Frothingham against Mellon?
3

MR. HODGSON;

Not really. Your Honor.

The Third

4 Circuit spent most of its time on Flast against Cohen and
5 tried to steer its reasoning around Flast.

I think it

6 finally concluded that under Flast, or this Court was bound
7 by limitations on the pleadings when it decided Flast.

Had

8 the fact situation been presented to this Court that was
9 before the Third Circuit, namely the presence of citizen
10 separationists, the Flast Court would have decided that
11 differently.
12

That was the general approach.

QUESTION;

Do you think that the Third Circuit

13 opinion would extend so far that if B is the subject of a
14 wrongful arrest under the Fourth Amendment, A could complain
15 about it ?
16

KR. HODGSON;

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

I agree that

17 the words of the opinion appear limited to the establishment
18 clause, but I think that the potential reach of this
19 decision, the implication of a personal right in every
20 citizen to enforce the Constitution at his or her demand is
21 limitless.
22

QUESTION:

That would include a challenge, do you

23 think, to the recently approved sale of some aircraft to
24 Saudi Arabia if they didn't like the foreign policy?
25

MR. HODGSON;

I would say that I could envision a

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

plaintiff, if this is Your Honor's question, making that

2 challenge.

I am a little lost to think of what provision of

3 the Constitution, but I could see that easily.

I think it

4 is limitless.
5

QUESTION;

Hr. Hodgson, I expect you may already

6 have covered it, but I didn’t catch it.

7

HR. HODGSON;

8

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Was this an outright transfer to your

9 client?
10
11

NR. HODGSON;

I am sorry, I don't know what you

mean by outright.

12

QUESTION;

13

MR.

14

QUESTION;

The property that you received.

HODGSON;

Yes.

I mean, this is a fee simple transfer,

15 is it ?
16

ME. HODGSON;

Well , yes, it was fee simple

17 transfer, but it had conditi ons, restrictive conditions,
18 including a reverter clause.
19

QUESTION;

The college is --

Well, i s there any rental arrangement

20 or anything like that?
21

MR. HODGSON;

No, Your Honor.

The college is

22 obliged to live up to the re presentations made in its

23 application for the property for a period of 30 years, and
24 any time during that 30-year period if the government
25 determines that there is non -compliance with those

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 representations, it may enter and revert the title.
2

QUESTION:

Thank you.

3

MR. HODGSON:

The law of this country on standing

4 until the radical

reconstruction of this standing test by

5 the Third Circuit

related to the finding of a personal

6 or injury in fact.

That has been the construction of

7 Article III by this Court.

stake

As to taxpayer standing, Flast

8 has been the first and, until that opinion, the last word.
9

As Your Honors will recall, Flast allowed a

10 taxpayer to challenge on establishment clause grounds a
11 Congressional exercise of the taxing and spending power of
12 the Constitution,

the Article T, Section 8 powers.

It was

13 specifically limited by the text of the opinion to those
14 circumstances and to that type of a statute.
15

This Court has strongly and consistently resisted

16 any effort to expand Flast on taxpayer basis beyond Article
171, Section 8, the taxing and spending power.

Specifically,

18 in Schlesinger, this Court rejected a taxpayer's challenge
19 that was brought pursuant to the incompatibility clause
20 under Article I.

The same could be said of Richardson

21 wherein executive action was challenged by a taxpayer
22 pursuant to Article I, Section 9, Clause 7.
23

Here, of course, these taxpayers seek still a

24 further run around Flast and say that the property clause,
25 Article IV, and Congressional action taken pursuant to that

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 clause should become the basis for standing.

MR.

Yes --

-- in this case?

HODGSON*

Oh, excuse me.

Although I would

8 call them persons rather than citizens to get away from the
9 concept of citizen standing, yes,

I can imagine a number of

10 Article III type injuries which would give a plaintiff
11 standing to sue.
12

For example, an applicant for the property that

13 was denied the application.

In other words, if Valley Forge

14 had been preferred over some other applicant, that
15 individual could bring an action to challenge -16

It is injury in fact.

There is aggrievement

And of

5 course any category of Article III plaintiff would have the

7

QUESTION;

And didn’t we say either in Schlesinger

I see.

And the other applicant for the

2 property, I can see the theory there.

Of course, if the

3 other applicant were also a religious institution, I suppose
4 they wouldn't have standing there.
5

MR. HODGSON:

No, I think they would.

I guess the

6 question then would be whether under -- on the merits,
7 whether the successful applicant was or was not a
8 disqualified institution under Article I.

QUESTION;

But if the theory of the claim is that

10 all religious institutions are disqualified -11

Are there not some cases in which, in

effect, cash grants made to religious colleges have been
sustained?
ME. HODGSON*

11

Yes.

Tilton, Hoemer, Hunt against

12

McNair, are all college education grant cases, where money,

13

pursuant to the taxing and spending power, is appropriated

uses, not for sectarian uses.

It goes to the merits, Your Honor.

It does not go to the question of standing.
The line of attack generally taken by the

21

Americans United in this case really relates to the merits,

22

claims that we are pervasively sectarian, claims that we

23

seek the perpetuation of formalism to this Court, claims

24

that this entire transaction is a sham, that the statute is

25

really an effort to bootleg federal surplus property around

3 kinds of claims which go to the merits, and as this Court
4 has said repeatedly, the standing inquiry focuses on the
5 litigant, not the issues which he seeks to have litigated,
6 and in Warth , very directly, standing in no way depends on
7 the merits.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE.-

11

Mr. Solicitor General.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF FEDERAL RESPONDENTS SUPPORTING PETITIONER

12

MR. LEEi

Mr. Chief Justice,

13 Court,I agree with Mr.

and may it please the

Hodgson that there probably are

14 other plaintiffs who could bring the suit in this case, but
15 it is correct, as he also pointed out, that this Court in
16 Schlesinger said that the lack of a better plaintiff does
17 not mean that this plaintiff has standing, and indeed it is
18 worthy of note that in the companion case. United States
19 versus

Richardson, this Court went one

20 said that the fact

that there is not a

step further, and
plaintiff who has

21 standing in the traditional Article III sense is a good
22 indication that it is the kind of case that ought to be left
23 to the political branches of government rather than to the
24 jud icia ry.
25

It is quite clear that since these plaintiffs

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 allege a harm that cannot be differentiated from the
2 hundreds of millions of other American citizens/ and since
3 they do not fit the Flast versus Cohen standards for
4 taxpayer standing, the only way that the judgment of the
5 Court of Appeals can be sustained is to uphold the rationale
6 of that court, which was that the establishment clause
7 creates in each citizen a personal constitutional right to a
8 government that does not establish religion.
9

There are two basic theories on the basis of which

10 that could be accomplished.

One is the one that Kr. Hodgson

11 suggested, which is that any citizen has a right to enforce
12 any provision of the Constitution, and frankly, it would be
13 difficult if the right were limited to the establishment
14 clause to distinguish it from many other provisions of the
15 Constitution, but the approach of the Court of Appeals
16

appears to have been to limit it to establishment clause to

17 distinguish it from many other provisions of the
18 Constitution.
19

But the approach of the Court of Appeals appears

20 to have been to limit it to establishment clauses.

As I

21 say, it has been difficult to do that, but that appears to
22 have been the approach of the Court of Appeals.
23

We would urge that even that approach represents

24 neither good law nor good constitutional policy for several
25 reasons.

One is that it would violate this Court's

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 consistent teaching which gives more deference to the
2 judicial article of the Constitution, Article III, that the
3 fundamental aspect of standing is that it focuses on the
4

party seeking to get its complaint before a federal court,

5 and not on the issues that he wishes to have adjudicated.
6

More specifically, requiring the precise

7 overruling of Doremus versus Board of Education, which was
8 an establishment clause case brought by a citizen and
9 dismissed because of the fact that there was no standing.
10 Doremus has been cited with approval both in Flast and also
11

12

Schlesinger.
Perhaps most important of all, the rulings of this

13

Court requiring first that the plaintiff be affected more

14

narrowly than members of the total populace, and second,

15 that standing focused on the plaintiff rather than on the
16 nature of the claim that the plaintiff is bringing lies
17 right at the heart of basic constitutional principles.
18
19

The feature of our constitutional system that
distinguishes courts from the other two branches of

20 government is that courts perform their law interpretive
21 function, including declarations of constitutionality, only
22 in cases or controveries, and interest of the kind that
23

these plaintiffs are pressing in this case, an interest in

24

seeing that a particular philosophy of government prevailed ,

25

can be carried to the elected branches, and those branches

4 aren't you really saying, then, that Flast was incorrectly
5 decided?
6

NR. LEE;

? that respect.

I agree with what Hr. Hodgson said in

Flast can be distinguished.

fit least Flast

8 presents only a -- if not a principle, at least a practical
9 departure from the general proposition that there is no
10 general authority in private citizens performing the
11 function of Attorney General, because of its limitation to
12 Congressional action and taxing and spending.
13

I would shed no tears if Flast were to be

14 overruled.

MR. LEE:

The Congressional statute.
-- so if you had a Congressional action

4 pursuant to the taxing ana spending clause, then your
5 statement is correct.
6

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Really, the only distinction here is

7 that we have real property rather than cash.
8

MR .

9

QUESTION:

LEE:

That is correct.
Under Doremus, both wo uld have come

10 the same say, would they not?
11

MR.

LEE:

That is correct.

Under Doremus, bo th

12 would have com e out the same way, and you r eally are at a
13Flast kind of crossroads.

You either maintan that holding

14 that is not entirely principled but at least practical and
15 workable.
16

A principle which this Court has cautioned on at

least two occasions represented only a slight departure from

17 Frothingham versus Mellon, or if you say that there is no
18 practical distinction, economic distinction between a
19 conveyance of money on the one hand and a conveyance of
20 property on the other hand,

then you can forget about Flast

21 versus Cohen, you can forget about the taxpayer standing.
22 You don't need it any more, because if citizens have
23 standing, then any property owner also or any taxpayer will
24 also have standing.
25

And that really brings me to the fundamental

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 reason that that would be a bad idea, to decide the case
2 that way.

In contrast to the political branches of

3 government, which are perfectly free under the Constitution
4 to entertain any advocacy for a particular form of
5 government, philosophy of government that is put to them,
6 the tradition ever since Marbury versus Madison has been
7 that courts decide only those issues as they arise in actual
8 lawsuits brought by persons who are injured in fact, and on
9 at least seven separate occasions, reaching all the way back
10 to the early parts of this century, this Court has said that
11 that injury in fact means an injury more specific than the
12 effect that is felt by the populace as a whole, and in our
13 separation of powers, check and balance constitutional
14 system, the most effective check on judicial power is the
15 case or controversy limitation.
16

The Court of Appeals suggested two possible bases

17 for distinguishing this case or for distinguishing
18 establishment clause cases from other cases.

One was that

19 the establishment clause does have or is a guarantor of
20 individual liberties, and it is true beyond doubt that it
21 can be, but far from being an argument in support of the
22 Court of Appeals decision, it is sguarely against it for
23 this reason, that in those instances where you do have that
24 kind of individualized harm, then that gives you a plaintiff
25 with traditional Article III standing, and where you don't

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 have it, then what you have is, as this Court said in
2 Richardson, the kind of case that by definition ought to be
3 handled by the Article III -- ought to be handled by the
4 Article I or the Article II branches.
5

The second proposition that was set forth by Judge

6 Rosen, whose vote was essential to the majority in the Court
7 of Appeals decision, was this matter that has already been
8 discussed, is there a better plaintiff, and this Court made
9 it very clear in both Richardson and Schlesinger that that
10 was not a relevant concern.

To the extent it is relevant,

11 it cuts the other way.
12

Finally, setting aside establishment clause cases

13 as being something of a special -- would give -- would
14 unduly degrade the judicial article of the Constitution,
15 which should have an independent life of its own, because to
16 the already complex and difficult issues that surround
17 standing, we would be visiting another layer of complexity,
18 a layer of complexity that would incorporate into the
19 Article III inquiry the question of what is an establishment
20 of religion, presumably including the three-part test that
21 this Court has struggled so mightily with over the past
22 decade.
23

QUESTION;

Is there anything in the Constitution,

24 Mr. Solicitor General, that would prohibit Congress from
25 enacting a statute that no property and no money would be

23

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 transferred or granted or given to a religiously controlled
2 college or school, and thus cut off any power in the
3 executive branch to make such a transfer as was made here?
4

MR. LEE;

I would be reluctant, Mr. Chief Justice,

5 to give a categorical answer to that until I have thought it
6 through a little.

My immediate temptation is to say no, and

7 yet if there were a categorical disqualification of religion
3 as religion from -- solely because they were religious
9 groups -10

QUESTION:

1

MR. LEE:

Indeed it does

And it bears out also

2 the point that this Court has stressed on a number of
3 occasions, statedfirst by Justice Holmes a good
4 century ago,

that there are also, in addition

part of a
to protections

5 that are built into the judicial system, but there are also
6 protections in Congress.

The fear has been, well, what if

7 you simply gave away the War College, or gave away the Naval
8 Academy.
9

In the first place, there probably would be

10 someone who could challenge that, but even if there weren't,
11 our system has survived for two centuries without that ever
12 happening, and the most immediately responsive branches to
13 that kind of thing ever happening would be the branches that
14 are going to

have to respond to the pressures

of the people

15 who cast the

votes, as this Court pointed out in its opinion

16 in Warth versus Seldin.
17

QUESTION;

Mr. Solicitor General,

I am not sure

18 that argument is controlling, because the phenomenon of
19 government support for private schools has become more
20 important in recent years, and the fact that it wasn't done
21 historically may not be a total answer, but suppose this
22 case had arisen in a state court, supposing a state
23 government did exactly what the federal government did here,
24 and a person who was not even a taxpayer sought to challenge
25 it, and the state court said, yes, we will entertain the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 challenge, would we have the right to review such a decision?
2

MR. LEE;

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. LEE;

5

QUESTION;

I think not.

I think not.

That is Doremus, I guess, isn't it?
I guess it is.

Yes.

As I recall Doremus, the state court

6 said there was standing.
7

MR. LEE;

Yes, that is Doremus.

The decision of,

3 I believe it was a New York court -9
10

QUESTION;
MB. LEE;

New Jersey court.
I certainly defer to your expertise on

11 that matter, Your Honor.
12

Let me just say in conclusion that I can conceive

13 of a constitutional system which gave to any citizen the
14 right to accede to the courts for the resolution of any
15 problem of public i mportance.

Something 1 ike that, not that

16 kind of — it would not be, in my opinion, the be st kind of
17 system, because I believe that our separation of powers,
18 checks and balances system is a better one.
19

Something like that was proposed with the Council

20 of Revision, which was expressly rejected by the
21 Constitutional Convention.
22

The underlying premise of Karbury versus Madison,

23 the reason for judicial review is that judicial review is
24 necessary to the performance by the Article III branch of
25 its function of deciding real lawsuits between real parties,

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and

this Court clarified a half-century ago in Chicago Grand

2 Trunk Railway versus Wellman that the corollary to that
3 Harbury versus Madison principle is also true, that courts
4 perform that function only in those circumstances where it
5 is necessary in order to perform their Article III case or
6 controversy decisional process.
7

Perhaps the most revealing statement on the record

8 in this case is that of the plaintiff Setumbrini, who said,
9 I represent all American citizens, and indeed he does.

That

10 is the kind of claim that under our constitutional system
11 and under traditional practice under this Court's precedents
12 must be taken to the political branches of government, and
13 not to the courts of the United States.
14

QUESTION:

15 one other question?

Mr . Solicitor General, may I ask you
If you recall in Justice Harlan's

16 dissent. in Flast against Cohen he draws the distinction
17 bet ween Hofeldian and non-Hofeldian cases
18

MR. LEE:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

Y es.

And he says that if Congress authorized

20 a non-Hofeldian standing, it would be all right.

Do you

21 disagree with that view?
22

MR. LEEs

I have serious problems with it, and

23 particularly in light of the subsequent holdings, probably
24 best spelled out in Warth versus Seldin, that there are
25 constitutional minima, that one of those constitutional

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 minima is injury in fact, so that the real issue becomes, is
2 the Richardson-Schlesinger type ruling, the citizen
3 standing, rooted in injury in fact, and in my view it is.
4That is the only part of Justice Harlan's opinion that I
5 disagree with.
6

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Boothby.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEE BOOTHBY, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF NON-FEDEBAL RESPONDENTS

9

MR. BOOTHBY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

10 the Court, I believe that this is the first opportunity
11 which this Court has had to address the question of standing
12 as it impacts on the establishment clause since the landmark
13 decision which had been discussed here of Flast versus Cohen
14 some 13 years ago.

This case also presents the first

15 establishment challenge to the Federal Property and
16 Administrative Services Act which the Court of Appeals has
17 suggested in this particular case that there is the
18 probability that no one -- that if these plaintiffs do not
19 have standing, no one perhaps has standing to challenge, and
20 I would suggest that if the Court should find that there is
21 no standing, that that particular Act, that particular Act
22 of Congress would be immune from the establishment clause
23 challenge, no matter how gross the violation might be.
24

QUESTION:

Wasn *t it said either in Reservists or

25 Schlesinger that the fact that there is no one who has

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 standing does not confer standing on someone?
2

MR. BOOTHBYi

It says that it is an indication

3 that it does not, that perhaps it should be handled by the
4 political branch.

However, I think in that particular case

5 the suggestion of then Solicitor General Robert Bork as he
6 argued that case before this Court is instructive, because
7 he in that particular case argued that the plaintiff
8 interest in CIA funding hardly rose to the dignity of a
9 constitutional right involved in Flast. because, as he said,
10 First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive,
11 and there is a broader concept of standing appropriate in
12 that particular area.
13

That was the argument that was made in Richardson.

14 in the brief in Richardson, the Solicitor General argued
15 that the case did not involve core values involved in Flast;
16

it involved the statement and account provision not central

17 to the Constitution, and thus the circumstances rendered
18 doubtful the occurrence of substantial adverse interest.
19

QUESTION;

But it was nonetheless a constitutional

20 provision.
21

MR. B00THBY;

It was a constitutional provision,

22 but it was dealing with Article I rather than with the
23 establishment clause, and I think that brings us to really
24 the very heart of this particular case.

The question is, is

25 the ultimate protection of values enshrined in the

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 establishment clause to reside with the judicial system, or
2 the judicial branch of government, or are there certain
3 establishment clause values that perhaps the political
4 branch has the ultimate authority in?
5

QUESTION:

Well, how do you distinguish the

6establishment clause in Article I, say, from the right to be
7 free from unlawful searches and seizures in Article IV and
3 the right to counsel in Article V or VI, or the right to
9 fair trial, that sort of thing?

Isn't it true that if the

10 judgment of the Third Circuit would be affirmed, the Court
11 would, as the Solicitor General suggests, have to be grading
12 various provisions of the Constitution as to their
13 fundamentality?
14

NR. B00THBY:

I think that the establishment

15 clause is different from even any other First Amendment
16 right for this reason.

It is an amorphous type right.

All

17 other First Amendment rights, right to free speech, free
18 exercise, to publish, have two aspects.

One is protection

19 from certain government action, and the other one is
20 protection for, to do certain specific things.
21

That is not true necessarily with the

22 establishment clause, because basically that right is a
23 right to be free from certain governmental actions, and may
24 not directly impact specifically uniquely on any particular
25 person, and I think that presents a separate, specific

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 problem that must be addressed in a practical way.
2

QUESTION;

Well, isn't that true, then, of any

3 taxpayer suit, that no -- we all pay taxes for many things
4 that we object to and perhaps wouldn't vote for if we were
5 legislators,

but that we can't show any discrete impact on

6 our own tax bill for it.

Would you say everybody had

7 standing to attack those sort of expenditures if they
8 claimed they violated the Constitution?
9

MR. BQOTKBY:

No, I think there is a distinction,

10 which was in fact pointed out in Richardson and in
11 Schlesinger, where a distinction was made between certain
12 core value rights given by the Constitution and the type of
13 political situation that was involved in both the decisions
14 of Schlesinger and Richardson.
15

QUESTION:

Well, are all constitutional provisions

16 core value?
17

MR. B00THBY:

I think perhaps there are certain

18 core values which have to be protected in different ways,
19 and I think a lot of what we are discussing today deals with
20 the prudential concerns of the Court, the concerns of
21 self-restraint, and

I would suggest that there is standing

22 from the constitutional standpoint in this particular case,
23 and what we are dealing with now are prudential concerns,
24 and the fact that if one accepts -- if one does accept the
25 view, which I suggest is an appropriate view under West

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Virginia versus Barnett, that certain rights must not be
2 left in the political process, then prudentially we have to
3 look to the court enforcement of those rights.
4

QUESTION;

But in Barnett, there was actual

5 standing in the sense that a particular school child was
6 forced to do something that he objected to on constitutional
7 grounds that he shouldn't have to do.
8

NR. BOOTHBY;

That may be true, but it gets back

9 to the basic question as to whether establishment rights
10 should be subject to the political process, subject to the
11 vote of the majority, and I suggest that that basic core
12 value right under the theory of Madison and Jefferson when
13 they suggested the religion clauses be included in the Bill
14 of Rights was to commit that to the judiciary for protection.
15

QUESTION;

Would you distinguish between the free

16 exercise clause and the establishment clause of the First
17 Amendment?
18

MR. BOOTHBY;

Mr. Chief Justice, both of those are

19 co-guarantors of religious liberty.

The difference is that

20 the free exercise right always impacts on a specific
21 individual or group of people, so prudentially you have a
22 person with standing without much difficulty.

When we are

23 discussing the problem with reference to the establishment
24 clause, we have a much different situation.
25

QUESTION;

Well, on your theory, then, on your

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 theory members of Jehovah's Witnesses and other religious
2 people who sincerely are opposed to all forms of warfare and
3 defense, military establishment, would have standing to
4 challenge the levying of a tax on them to the extent that
5 tax was used to buy tanks and airplanes and other things.
6 Is that right ?
7

MR. BOOTHBY;

Well, perhaps they have standing.

8 The question then would be raised as to what the compelling
9 state interest might be, and how -10

QUESTION;

Well, all we are concerned here with

11 now, we are talking about standing, aren’t we?
12

NR. BOOTHBY;

13

QUESTION:

Yes, the question in that case --

We are not getting to the merits of

14 this case.
15

MR. BOOTHBY;

Under the free exercise clause, the

16 question would be, does that particular governmental action
17 impact or burden their religious freedom, and if they could
18 demonstrate under the free exercise clause that it does,
19 then they would have standing, I think, to bring the matter
20 before the Court as to whether what the decision would be
21 would be based upon the balancing test.
22

QUESTION;

Do you agree with the Solicitor

23 General, whose response was that Congress would have the
24 power to forbid transfers of this kind and transfers, grants
25 to colleges on religious grounds?

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. BOOTHBYt

I would think, that they would have

2

the power to do that.

3

should be the final authority to determine whether their own

4

actions are in violation of the establishment clause, which

5

I suggest has been committed to the judiciary.

6

QUESTION;

The question is as to whether they

Well, I don't follow that.

If Congress

7

simply said, we are not going to give any money, we are not

8

going to transfer any property to a religiously sponsored

9

school or college, do you seriously guestion their authority

10

to do that?

11
12

MR. B00THBY;

Are we discussing it now in the

context of the free exercise clause?

13

QUESTION;

No, we are just discussing it in the

14

abstract.

15

any religious school, no property can be transferred except

16

for full value to any religious school.

17

right of Congress to do that?

They just say no money, no money can be given to

18

MR. B00THBY;

19

QUESTION;

20
21

Do you question the

I think Congress --

That avoids all your problems of the

establishment clause, doesn’t it?
MR. B00THBY;

It would avoid it if the Congress in

22

fact did that.

The question is, we have here a 31-year

23

history where that has not been the situation, where the

24

benefit allowance has always been granted to the extent of

25

95 to 100 percent, and the question is whether anyone can

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 ever challenge what seems to us to be indistinguishable, the
2 question of whether you are giving cash, giving an
3 appropriation of dollars, or whether you are giving bricks
4 and mortar, and whether you are giving personal property, it
5 seems indistinguishable.
6

QUESTION:

What was the government giving in the

7 Tilton case ?
8

MR. EOOTHBY:

Well, in the Tilton case, it was --

9 it involved different items, but one of the items which was
10 specifically addressed by the Court was with reference to
11 buildings which 20 years — there was a provision there that
12 at the end of 20 years, the restrictions were at an end, and
13 this Court invalidated a specific part of it dealing with a
14 facility that might be turned into a chapel or something for
15a religious purpose.
16

Here, in this particular case, we don’t have to

17 wait 20 years down the road to find some speculation as to
18 whether it is going to be used for a chapel.

There was a

19 specific building which was in the nature of a chapel that
20 was given to the -- to the college and used directly and
21 immediately for a chapel, so what we have here in part was
22 the government giving a chapel to the college to be used for
23 pervasively sectarian instruction, which I can see no
24 difference between this and the decision in Tilton.
25

QUESTION:

Which chapel was formerly used by the

MR. BOOTHBY

3

QUESTIONi

4

MR. BOOTHBY:

That is correct
With nobody's objection.
That is correct, but of course we

5 have distinguished under the free exercise clause prisons
6 and chapels and chaplains in the armed services, because of
7 the restrictions that are placed upon servicemen and upon
8 prisoners, and as a means to accommodate because of the
9 restrictions that government has imposed, we have permitted
10 the furnishing of chapels in those instances, but -11
12 permit.
13

QUESTION;

I am not too worried about what you

I am worried about what the Constitution permits.
MR. BOOTHBY;

I believe that that has been the

14 theory under the chaplaincy and for chapels in the armed
15 services.
16

QUESTION;

How about chaplains in the Senate and

17 House?
18

MR. BOOTHBY;

That has, of course, been a long

19 tradition there, and perhaps under the decisions dealing
20 with the ceremonial decisions, those type of decisions, that
21 would be a basis for sustaining that.
22

QUESTION:

Mr. Boothby, if the Court were to

23 affirm the Court of Appeals' decision, would you agree that
24 really any person could come in then as a plaintiff and
25 raise any establishment clause question, without any

36

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 practical limitation?
2

MR. BOOTHBYj

I think the Court -- they always

3 impose certain prudential considerations.

As this Court has

4 said as recently as last year, in the Geraghty case, that
5 the Court should view these cases on a case by case basis.
6

QUESTION;

But wouldn’t that be the danger or

7 concern we would have if we were to apporve that decision?
8

MR. BQOTHBY:

To the type of cases that directly

9 impact on specific individuals, I see no particular problem
10 with those requirements.

In addition, I would suggest that

11 we are not dealing nor should we deal with a generalized
12 grievance or one where we are asking merely for an advisory
13 opinion.

That is not the situation in this case.

In this

14 case, where it is a plaintiff not attacking generally an Act
15 of Congress, but is attacking a specific transfer of
16 property, and so we have a factual context in which this
17 case is brought, and I would suggest that to the extent that
18 the injury that we are concerned with is an amorphous type
19 of situation where it is a step down the way towards the
20 establishment of religion than citizens should be.
21

Let me suggest this, because I think we are going

22 to the question of the locus of the injury.

Does it make

23 any difference, for instance, whether the citizen who feels
24 aggrieved lives next door to Valley Forge Christian
25 College?

It really doesn’t.

Now, it does make a difference

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 if we are talking about a public school engaging in
2 sectarian religious education within that school.

Yes, the

3 people within that community have a more direct impact.
4 that is not the situation here.

But

We are talking about a

5 transfer of property, government property, to be used for
6 pervasively sectarian teaching, and I think the locus of it
7 is unimportant.
8

QUESTION;

Didn't the framers of our constitution

9 really reject the idea of a roving commission to challenge
10 actions of the government, and didn't the framers really
11 contemplate the case in controversy requirement, which in
12 essence embodies standing, and isn't this opinion a
13 significant departure from that basic concept?
14

NR. BOOTHBYs

15 significant departure.

I don't believe it to be a
As I understand the Article III

16 requirements of standing, that is, that there must be injury
17 in fact, we are talking about a case presented in a manner
18 where it is an historical setting for judicial relief.

We

19 are talking about a situation where the issues are presented
20 by adversaries in a factual context, and I believe that is
21 met in this particular type of case.
22

QUESTION;

What is the injury in fact?

23

NR. BOOTHBYt

Injury in fact in this particular

24 case is that type of injury which is experienced by many
25 people in this country, but the fact that government is not

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 being neutral and establishing an environment which prevents
2 a government operating with a separation of church and state.
3

QUESTION;

Well, is that the sort of injury in

4 fact that Barlows or Associated Processing was concerned
5 with ?
6

MR. BOOTHBY;

Well, of course, those were

7 concerned with economic problems.
8

QUESTION;

Yes.

9

MR. BOOTHBY;

But in Data Processing the Court

10 specifically indicated that what it said in that case also
11 applied to spiritual values, and we are dealing here with a
12 spiritual value, not an economic value.
13

QUESTION;

Mr. Boothby, along that same line, can

14 you argue your case on standing without getting into the
15 merits?
16

MR. BOOTHBY;

Yes.

I don't think one needs to get

17 into —
18

QUESTION;

I don't see how you can argue your

19 standing without the merits, because you say that unless
20 this is a church school, you have no case.
21

MR. BOOTHBY;

22

QUESTION;

I don't think one --

Well, if this is a school that is

23 completely non-sectarian, do you have standing?
24

MR. BOOTHBY;

I think that in order to reach the

25 standing question, as the Court said in Flast, to find out

You do not need to determine whether in fact this

5 is a pervasively sectarian institution, merely look to see
6 whether there is an allegation -7

Then you have to get to the merits.

8 You would rather call it facts, but I prefer to call it
9 merits.
10

HR. ROOTHBYj

6

MR. BOOTHBY;

Well, I think you have to look to

7 the facts briefly, as Flast said, in order to determine
8 whether there is a nexus between the individual's injury and
9 the constitutional provision.
10

QUESTION;

Mr. Boothby, you have referred two or

11 three times to the free exercise clause.

I had thought the

12 Third Circuit's opinion was limited to establishment clause
13 claim.
14

MR. B00THEY;

15

QUESTION;

That is correct.

Which is your view, that it should be

16 limited to establishment clause?
17

MR. BOOTHBY;

Yes.

It is only an establishment

18 question here, and as I indicated, I think the establishment
19 clause presents unique problems that are not experienced in
20 the free exercise clause, because of the nature.
21 Establishment problems are created, as the Chief Justice in
22 Lemon indicated, when the first step is taken respecting the
23 establishment of religion, and so, in order to protect
24 against that very first step, it is necessary to be able to
25 raise the question in a judicial forum when there is a case

presented in a historical way with specific facts asking for

2

specific relief directed against the -- what is perceived to

3

be the wrong.

4
5

QUESTION;

And the specific allegations about

establishment.

6

MR. B00THBY:

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. E00THBY;

9
10

I think that you need to say that --

You have to have allegations.
-- you are basing it upon an

establishment claim, yes.
I think there might be an illustration that would

11

demonstrate perhaps why the establishment question raises

12

separate questions, and let me suggest, what if Congress

13

would enact a law that would say, we are officially

14

recognized in a certain church as the official church,

15

Baptist church, Unitarian church, Presbyterian, or whatever

16

it might be, but we provide no sanctions and we grant no

17

money, we make no appropriation.

18

The question is, would anyone have a right to come

19

before a court and ask that that particular Congressional

20

act be voided, or is that something specifically that you

21

would have to go to the Congress and go through the

22

political proces in order to accomplish, and I submit that

23

those are the type of problems as it is particularly

24

highlighted in this case, where you must have, you need to

25

have access to the courts to prevent violations of the

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 establishment clause from occurring
2

QUESTION:

Would you be here, Hr. Boothby, if they

3 had sold it for $500,000?
4

HR. BOOTHBY;

First of all, this really involves

5 $1,300,000 when you involve the personal property, but I
6 think the principle involved is important whether we are
7 talking about $500,000 or whether we are talking about $100,
8 the principle is.
9

QUESTION:

Now, obviously -What principle would be involved if

10 they sold it for $500,000?
11

MR. BOOTHBY;

Oh, if they sold it and received

12 $500,000?
13

QUESTION:

Yes.

14

KR. BOOTHBY;

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. BOOTHBY;

Less than value.

Less than the value?

Less than value.
Then you would be perhaps -- I think

17 perhaps there would be standing, but the question would be
18 on the merits as to whether there was an actual gift made by
19 the government without consideration, whether it was in fact
20 a contribution or a donation to some extent .
21

QUESTION:

Then what if they put it up for

22 auction, limiting the bidders to colleges and universities,
23 and this institution was the low bidder, and the bid was
24 $100,000, way below value.

Would you have standing first?

25 Let's stay with standing.

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. BOOTHBY;

To the extent that you could make

2 out a claim of violation, I would say perhaps you would have
3 standing.
4

QUESTION:

Doesn't that illustrate the practical

5 side of this situation, that you must leave the running of
6 the government to the people who were elected to run it?
7

MR. BOOTHBY:

I think that is normally true,

8 except when you have this type of situation where we are
9 talking about a violation of such a basic core value, and I
10 don't believe that one should have to go to the political
11 processes in order to have that redressed.
12

One other -- perhaps one other matter which goes

13 to this particular problem is the fact that one of the
14 things that indicates that this is a case in controversy,
15 and this is a case for judicial relief, is, I would
16 seriously question whether the executive or the legislative
17 would have power to provide the relief which is requested.
18 We are requesting that a transfer which has been made be
19 voided.

I would suggest that it would be difficult, if not

20 impossible, for the legislative branch or the executive
21 branch to perform that.

That is the type of relief which is

22 uniquely within the power of a court to provide.
23

So, I don't think that the executive or

24 legislative branch can provide that type of relief.

QUESTIONS

That’s correct.

Is there any allegation in here other

5 than that, which seems to relate to status as taxpayers,
6 that indicates an injury in fact to these particular
7 plaintiffs?
8

ME. BOOTHBYf

Hot in the complaint, Your Honor.

I

9 might make reference to Page 13 of the brief that was filed
10 on behalf of the college, where they specifically stated,
11 which is correct, that Respondents were given the
12 opportunity through discovery to particularize the
13 allegations of the amended complaint in connection with the
14 district court’s ruling of the college’s motion for summary
15 judgment.

The depositions and answers to interrogatories

16 were considered.
17

And I would suggest that the injuries that we are

18 talking about were particularized in those depositions, and
19 specifically Pages 28 through -- 27 through 30 of the
20 plaintiff Gunn's deposition, where he described in a very
21 particularized way those type of injuries with which he was
22 concerned, where, on Page 28, he stated,

"When the

23 government establishes religion, that is, contributes to the
24 establishment of religion, my religious liberty is being
25 violated.

It affects me in that my freedom of conscience is

-- is fostering and

It is not the business of government to

4 do this.

The government is to remain neutral."

5

Then,

"When the government gives over public lands

6 that belong to the public,
7 property,

and public buildings and personal

then it is promoting one religion over against all

8 other religions."
9
10 matters

And further,

"When the government takes sides on

of religion, it is taking a side against my

11 religion,

and therefore is inhibiting me and violating my

12 freedom

of conscience by forcing me as a taxpayer and as a

13 citizen

to give support to someone else's religion."

14

Suggested that

16 exacting judicial scrutiny of state action is appropriate

19

I would suggest that we can't have exacting

20 judicial scrutiny when there is an absolute denial of all
21 judicial scrutiny, and one of the things that has been
22 highlighted in this particular case is that no one perhaps
23 might have standing if these particular plaintiffs do not
24 have standing.
25

It has been suggested that perhaps someone close

50
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 by in the area might have some standing about a drain or
2 something, but those people are not going to be specifically
3 concerned about raising establishment issues except to some
4 extent that it might assist their case.

Also, it was

5 suggested that there might be another applicant for the
6 property, and again

I would suggest that that concern is

7 more economic than one dealing with the values enshrined in
8 the establishment clause, and it would seem that if we are
9 trying to find the plaintiff to raise the establishment
10 issue in the most specific way to bring to the attention of
11 the court the issue, we should be looking at the plaintiff
12 that can best present the establishment clause challenge
13 from the standpoint of their own specific injury, the injury
14 being a violation of their rights under the establishment
15 clause.
16

In Warth versus Seldin, it was stated that the

17 standing question requires a determination as to whether the
18 constitutional or statutory provisions on which a claim
19 rests properly can be understood as granting persons in the
20 plaintiff's position judicial relief, and I would suggest
21 that the establishment clause does do just that.

It grants

22 to a specific individual the right to judicial relief.
23

I question whether it is ever tolerable to expect

24 the establishment clause by the doctrine of standing to be
25 divided into enforceable and non-enforceable establishment

18 the Court has any questions, I will do my best to attempt to
19 answer them.

Otherwise, I am prepared to submit the case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF C. CLARK HODGSON, JR., ESQ.

21

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

22

QUESTION;

23 during the argument.

I have a question that occurred to me
Someone referred to the case we had

24 earlier this week that also came from Pennsylvania,
25 involving a religious group, some people who felt very

53

1 deeply that paying a certain tax would be a sin against
2 their religion.
3

Supposing someone living next door to this

4 institution felt that it would be a sin to live in a
5 community in which the government established a religion in
6 which they had no belief, or they just thought it would be a
7 sin even to live where the government established religion.
8 Would that person have standing?
9

MR. HODGSON*

You seem to be positing the

10 existence of a free exercise injury in fact, Article III,
11 and I would say yes.
12

QUESTION*

Well, supposing somebody said it is a

13 sin to live in a country in which the federal government
14 does this sort of thing.

Would that still -- would you

15 think that would be standing?
16

MR. HODGSON;

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. HODGSON .*

I think it alleges —

A deeply held belief.
— it alleges an injury in fact, an

19 alleged violation of the free exercise clause.
20

QUESTION:

Well, th e injury to him is continuing

21 to live there.
22

MR. HODGSON;

Yes.

I can’t help but think of it

23 on the merits, thinking particularly of Reynolds versus
24 United States, the polygamy case, that believing as a matter
25 of religious conscience that the practice of bigamy was

1 appropriate, but of course that goes to the merits, but I
2 think that the allegations that you fashion, while they
3 appear at least to be frivolous, might fall within the free
4 exercise.
5

QUESTION;

Well, supposing these people, instead

6 of stressing their taxpayer status, had just said they
7 believe very deeply that it will offend their conscience to
8 have their government do this.
9

MR. HODGSON;

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. HODGSON;

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. HODGSON;

Is that really different?

That it offends their conscience?

It offendstheirconscience.
Yes.

Just as a matter of conscience.
I think it is very different.

14 conscience as citizens of the United States.

Their

Because

15 matters of citizen conscience, I think, are not protected
16 under the Constitution.

Matters of deeply felt religious

17 conviction are protected under the free exercise.
18

QUESTION;

I see.

MR. HODGSON;
