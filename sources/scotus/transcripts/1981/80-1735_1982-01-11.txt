ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,

8
9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GELLER;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10 it please the Court;
11

This is a Freedom of Information Act case here on

12 writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia circuit.

At

13 issue is Exemption 7 of the FOIA which exempts from
14 mandatory disclosure investigatory records compiled for law
15 enforcement purposes to the extent that production of such
16 records would cause one of six discrete harms listed by
17 Congress in Exemption 7.
18

The question presented is whether records in the

19 FBI's law enforcement files that satisfy Exemption 7, and
20 hence that are exempt from mandatory disclosure, lose that
21 exempt status when they are later summarized into another
a

22 FBI document that was not compiled for purposes of law
23 enforcement.
24

And the documents involved in this case are

25 so-called name check summaries concerning eleven individuals
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that were prepared by the FBI in October 1969 in response to

2 a request by John Ehrlichman, who was then the counsel to

3 the President.
4

The FBI frequently prepares name check summaries

5 at the request of the White House, generally when someone is
6 being considered for a presidential appointment or for an

7 invitation to a White House function.
8

When the FBI got the White House request in this

9 case, it, as it did in other name check requests, checked
10 its law enforcement records and wrote a short memorandum
11

summarizing its file information about each of the eleven

12 individuals.

In the case of a few of the individuals the

13 FBI files included a name check summary that had been
14 prepared in response to an earlier White House request.
15

QUESTIONi

Mr. Geller, would you briefly define

16 what a name check is?
17

MS. GELLER:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
I think I know, but I'd like to have

19 you tell me.
20
21

MB. GELLER:

A number of agencies in the federal

government, including the White House, when they need

22 certain information for perfectly lawful purposes about a

23 particular individual, they will ask the Federal Bureau of
24 Investigation to check its files and run what is called a
25 name check on that individual and notify the agency of
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

anything pertinent that they may have found.

2

And as I said, the White House frequently would

3

send over name check requests to the FBI; for example, when

4

the President was thinking of naming somebody to a

5

presidential appointment or someone was being considered for

6 an invitation to a White House function, there would have to
7

be some security checks and other things.

8

QUESTION;

9

KB. GELLER;

10

13

It is a memorandum summarizing

information in the FBI's files in the individual's case.

11
12

But I ask again, what is it?

Perhaps the facts of this case are a trifle
confusing.

It might well benefit the Court at this point —
QUESTION:

You mean the FBI would respond only,

14

with respect to the individual, only with respect to what it

15

found in its own files?

16

MR. GELLER:

That's right.

They would not do a

17

separate investigation.

18

for that person and write a memorandum explaining —

19

QUESTION;

They would simply check their files

Do they not check their files generally

20 to see whether there are any arrest records of the person?
21

22
23

Isn't that the starting point of a name check?
MR. GELLER:

Yes.

That would be in their file if

they had that information.

24

QUESTION:

If they had it.

25

MR. GELLER:

They would not go about —

6 routine checks.
7

But they do not send out a nationwide -

That’s not what
These are fairly

The FBI, as I understand it, does not do

anything more in response to these routine inquiries than

8 check their file information; and if they find nothing, they
9 will tell the agency we found nothing in our file about the
10
11

individual.
QUESTION;

Well, if someone has an arrest record

12

out in Tipperary or some other place, would that be in the

13

FBI’s files or not?

14

MR. GELLER:

I think that they are computerized to

15

the extent that that could be determined.

16

they don’t go out and do a separate investigation in

But the point is

I know, but the FBI doesn't have in its

files every arrest that’s been made since time began.
MR. GELLER*

No.

I assume at some point these

arrest records began to be integrated into the FBI’s files.

22 I’m not aware of when that date was.

But do you think as of today when

there’s a name check, if someone's been arrested for

MB. GELLEB:

Well, I hesitate to give an answer

3 with certainty to that question, Justice White.

I'd like to

4 check —
5

QUESTION*

Well, that's all right.

I just

6 wondered if you knew or not.
7

MB. GELLEB*

I do not know.

My understanding is

8 that they can probably find that information very quickly
9 through computerization.
10

QUESTION*

I think that there is a hookup.

Well, what does that mean?

Is it in

11 its own files or not?
12

MB. GELLEB*

Well, I'm not sure that the FBI these

13 days is arranged with —
14
15 then?
16 files.

All right.

What are you referring to

That's what you said.

QUESTION*

That's right.
Do you mean what's on their own

20

MB. GELLER*

21

QUESTION*

I believe that's right.
All right.

Well, then, I ask you

22 again, do they have on their computer everybody's arrest
23 record in the last five years?
24

MR. GELLEB*

I would have to say that I don't know

25 the answer to that question.

Of course, these name check

1 requests came in in 1969.
2

QUESTION;

Sell, would it have on the computer

3 anybody's conviction for anything in the last five years?
4

MR. GELLER;

I would doubt that, but I don't know

5 the answer to that question, once again, as to the internal
6 organization of the FBI.
7

QUESTION*

But —

Mr. Geller, could I ask you a question

8 about your terminology?
9
10

MR. GELLER*
QUESTION*

Yes.
Do you use the term documents or

11 records or files as words of art for purposes of the FOIA?
12

MR. GELLER*

No.

The Court of Appeals did, but

13 none of these are defined terms under the Freedom of
14 Information Act.

We don't think they have any particular

15 significance.
16

It's important to realize that the 1974 amendments

17 to Exemption 7 were quite controversial, and there were a
18 number of allegations by opponents of those amendments that
19 these amendments would hinder law enforcement.

And in fact,

20 President Ford vetoed the 1974 amendments for that reason,
21 and the amendments were repassed over his veto.
22

Now, there was substantial debate both prior to

23 and after

the veto as to what the thrust of these amendments

24 would be,

and proponents of these amendments, such as

25 Senator Hart and Senator Kennedy, repeatedly assured their
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 colleagues that no information, no matters, no records, no
2 documents in the FBI’s law enforcement records would have to
3 be turned over to any FOIfl requester if one of these six
4 discrete harms listed in the statute would occur as a result
5 of production.
6

They used these words interchangeably.

The word "record" is not defined under the FOIA,

7 but interestingly, it is defined under the Privacy Act which
8 was passed the very same week as the 1974 amendments to the
9 FOIA.

And the Privacy Act defines "record" as including any

10 item of information.
11 documents.

It doesn’t talk about discrete

And we think that that same sort of definition

12 should apply in construing the FOIA and particularly in
13 construing the Exemption 7.
14

QUESTIONS

Incidentally, you mention privacy.

Did

15 the Government take the position that Exemption 6 at one
16 time applied, the privacy exemption?
17

MR. GELLER*

At the time that the initial request

18 came in, I think that the FBI in responding to that FOIA
19 request listed Exemption 6 as well as Exemption 7(C).
20

QUESTIONS

And why has it been abandoned?

21

MR. GELLERs

Well, I think it was probably

22 abandoned because the people who were putting together the
23 District Court papers in this case assumed that these were
24 clearly law enforcement records and that the pertinent
25 exemption was Exemption 7.
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Also, when you're dealing with personal privacy,

2 as this Court noted in the Rose case. Exemption 7(C) imposes
3 on the Government a somewhat easier test to meet than
4 Exemption 6.

Under Exemption 6 the Government would have to

5 show a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,
6 whereas under Exemption 7(C) all that would have to be shown
7 is an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.
8

So I assume that Exemption 6 was not put forward

9 on the understanding that Exemption 7(C) was more relevant
10 and imposed an easier test on the Government to meet.
11

QUESTION!

Mr. Geller, I gather from your response

12 to some earlier question that if the White House sent over
13 and said give us a name check on Kenneth Geller, you can't
14 tell us what process the FBI would go through in response to
15 that name check.
16

MR. GELLER»

I think what they would do is they

17 would go to their files, and they would check to see what -18

QUESTION:

19

MR. GELLER:

20 two sets of files.
21

Well, now, their files, their files.
Well, they keep, as I understand it,

One would be by name.

QUESTION:

Well, I take it that, if I may

22 interrupt, that there's a full field investigation on you so
23 that they wouldn't have to resort just to the name check.
24

MR. GELLER:

Well, the result of the full field

25 investigation, as I understand it, would be in the file on

1 me or on the eleven individuals whose names were requested
2 in this case.
3

But as I say, the facts are a little confusing,

4 and I do think it would help the Court if I could direct the
5 Court’s attention at this point to pages 31 and 32.
6

QUESTION!

Of what?

7

MR. GELLER*

Of the Joint Appendix.

And page 31

8 is one of the name checks that was sent over in response to
9 the Ehrlichman request.

This was a name check on Joseph

10 Duffey, and this is it, one page long, essentially saying
11 that there was nothing on Mr. Duffey in the files.

However,

12 there was one piece of information that was deleted, blacked
13 out there under Exemption 7.
14

Page 32 of the Joint Appendix contains another one

15 of the name checks sent over in response to the Ehrlichman
16 request, this one for John Kenneth Galbraith.

Once again,

17 all it says is that prior name checks had been prepared for
18 Mr. Galbraith in 1961 and 1965, presumably when President
19 Kennedy and President Johnson were considering him for a
20 presidential appointment.

And copies of those prior name

21 checks are attached.
22

Now, these prior name checks are the so-called

23 attachments that we refer to in our brief and that the Court
24 of Appeals refers to in its opinion.
25

QUESTION*

Incidentally, how many of those
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

attachments are involved here, Mr. Geller?

There are eleven

2 individuals, but how many attachments do we have?

3

MR. GELLER:

4

QUESTION:

There were —
Forgive me.

I understand one of the

5 Government's arguments is if an attachment exists that
6 that's sufficient to qualify for the exemption, isn't it?

7

MR. GELLERi

8 don't dispute that.

Well, the Court of Appeals — we
The Court of Appeals distinguished

9 between the name check summaries prepared in 1969 in
10 response to the Ehrlichman request and the attachments,
11

which were in existence before that.

12

QUESTION:

Now, how many of these eleven

13 individuals are the —
14

MR. GELLERi

I think there were attachments as to

15 about four of these individuals.

Some of these attachments

16 are prior name check requests, as in the case of John
17 Kenneth Galbraith.

Some of the attachments were other raw

18 FBI documents that happened to be in that person's file, and
19 rather than summarize them or excerpt them, they were simply
20 attached and sent over.
21

The Court of Appeals found that as

to those attached documents if those attached documents were

22 compiled for purposes of law enforcement that they would

23 retain —
24

QUESTION:

I gather in light of what the Court of

25 Appeals said, at least as to those four, the Court might
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 believe Exemption 7 applies.
2

QUESTION:

Only to the attachments.

3

MR. GELLER:

Only to the attachments.

The Court

4 of Appeals remanded to the District Court to determine
5 whether those attachments had been prepared for purposes of
6 law enforcement, and if they were, then Exemption 7, the
7 Court of Appeals said, would apply to them.

That’s what we

8 think is —
9

QUESTION:

Well, what would the Court of Appeals

10 say if the name check, the main body of the name check that
11 was sent back purported to summarize one of the attachments?
12

MR. GELLER;

I think that the Court of Appeals

13 clearly said, I think that's the holding in this case, that
14 those summaries —
15

QUESTION;

It would still say that the attachment

16 might be exempt, but the summary would not.
17

MR. GELLER:

Not the summary, not the summary.

18 And that's what we find to be the utter literalness and
19 foolishness of the distinction that the D.C. Circuit has
20 drawn between the summaries, which are simply summaries of
21 underlying raw FBI documents, and the attachments, which
22 were the FBI documents themselves.

They contain the same

23 information in the two, but because one was prepared in 1969
24 in response to what the Court of Appeals thought was not a
25 law enforcement request, Exemption 7 is not applicable as to
13

1

them

2

Now, the Respondent made an FOIA request in 1976

3

for the documents that were sent over to the White House in

4

response to John Ehrlichman's request, and the FBI

5

eventually gave Respondent a large amount of materials, but

6 it deleted certain portions of these materials under
7

Exemption 7(C) for personal privacy reasons and Exemption

8 7(D) because disclosure would reveal the identify of a
9 confidential source.
10

Respondent didn’t challenge the 7(D) deletions,

11

but he did claim that the deletions under Exemption 7(C)

12

were improper.

13

upheld those deletions, but the Court of Appeals reversed.

14

The Court of Appeals was willing to accept the FBI's

15

contention that the name check summaries were nothing more

16

than summaries of underlying law enforcement documents, and

17

they were also willing to accept arguendo that those

18

underlying documents were entitled to Exemption 7 protection.

The District Court agreed with the FBI and

In addition, the Court of Appeals didn’t take

19

20 issue with the District Court’s findings that release of
21

this information would have led to one of the specific harms

22 that Congress included in Exemption 7, 7(C), personal
23

privacy.

The Court of Appeals nonetheless ordered the

24

sensitive information disclosed to Respondent because the

25

Court found that the name check summaries themselves, as
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

opposed to the underlying documents they summarized, were

2 not investigatory records compiled for law enforcement
3

purposes but were instead, according to the Court of

4

Appeals, prepared for political purposes.

5

therefore found that the summaries did not satisfy the

6 threshold requirement of Exemption 7 and had to be disclosed.
7

QUESTION;

Does the record show the dates when the

8 information was compiled as to each of the persons in

10

11

question?

In other words, was it ten years before or one

week before?
MR. GELLER;

Well, as to the attachments, the name

12

check summaries were all prepared in October 1969 in

13

response to the Ehrlichman request.

14

said in the case of John Kenneth Galbraith, those

15

attachments were prepared in 1961 and 1965, and some of the

16

other attachments in this case may well have gone back even

17

longer than that.

18
19

QUESTION;

The attachments, as I

Well, taking Mr. Galbraith, Professor

Galbraith as one example, did he hold any public office on

20 which they would have made a name check?
21

MR. GELLER;

I believe that Mr. Galbraith was

22 appointed as Ambassador to India by President Kennedy.
23
24
25

QUESTION;

And this might have — is that date

related to his appointment as Ambassador?
MR. GELLER;

Yes.

I don't think there's any

Johnson was thinking of appointing him to some position.
QUESTIONj

Mr. Geller, can I ask you a question

about how far your position takes us?

Supposing we agreed

6 with you that the summaries when given to Mr. Ehrlichman

7 were still within the exemption.

Then suppose Mr.

8 Ehrlichman wrote a report for the President which said
9 have found out the following information

I

without describing

10

its source, and he confined himself to what he got here and

11

sent it to the President.

Then say the President sent that

12 information to the Bureau of Internal Revenue and said

I

13 want you to audit the returns of these people because I
14 found out the following information.
15

Would the whole chain still be protected?

16

MR. GELLER:

17 to arise this way,

Well, the situation is very unlikely

but if the agency that receives the FOIA

18 request looks at the document that it has been asked for and
19 can show that that information originally came into the

20 Government's hands —
21

QUESTION:

Well, say the request goes to the

22 Internal Revenue Sevice in my hypothesis, and they trace it
23 back and say this all came from law enforcement sources.
24 It's been rewritten two or three times, but the basic
25 information is precisely what's involved in this case.

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MB. GELLERi

Yes

As I say, I think it’s unlikely

2 to arise this way, but yes, our argument would extend that
3 far.

But I think it's important to remember that it’s the

4 agency that is going to have the burden of doing this
5 tracing, and it*s often not going to be very easy to do.
6

QUESTION;

I understand.

7

MR. GELLER;

And it’s also important to remember

8 that simply tracing this information back to law enforcement

9 files does not make it exempt.

All it means is that you

10 meet the threshold test under Exemption 7.

QUESTION;

No.

MR. GELLER;

QUESTION*

You still —

The agency would still —

in

There’s no question in this case — Judge

20 Ritchie made a finding, and the Respondent did not appeal it
21 — that the privacy protection of Exemption 7(C) would be
22 violated with these releases.
23

Hell, Mr. Geller, you wouldn’t suggest,

24 would you, that if in this chain that Justice Stevens
25 describes this information is included in a document that is

MR. GELLERs

Well, the Sears case dealt with

14

QUESTIONS

All right.

15

MR. GELLERs

Go ahead.

He don’t believe that the factors

16 that underlie Exemption 5 are the identical sort of
17 considerations that underlie other considerations.
18 Exemption 5 has to do with predecisional determinations,
19 preserving the sanctity of the predecisional process.

And

20 once a final decision has been made and the predecisional
21 determinations have been expressly adopted, the Court found
22 in Sears that there is no reason at that point to protect
23 the predecisional memorandum.
24

QUESTION;

But if an agency includes this kind of

25 information, normally would include this kind of information
18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in a document that is normally available, if it actually
2 relies on this piece of information for coming to a
3 conclusion, the explanation of which is normally made public
4 —
5

MR. GELLER;

Well, you know, in Sears the Court

6 faced a situation somewhat like this, and while it said that
7 —
8

QUESTION;

I know.

9

MR. GELLER;

— Exemption 5 would no longer be

10 applicable, documents that are entitled to Exemption 7
11 protection would not lose that protection if they were
12 incorporated in a final document.
13

Now —

14

QUESTION;

Mr. Geller, can I back up a minute?

15 The information, is it from the raw files?

Does it include

16 raw files?
17

MR. GELLER:

18 files, yes.
19

Some of these attachments are raw

Yes, they are.

Now, perhaps the best way to explain the error in

20 the Court of Appeals' mechanical and excessively literal
21 approach is to give a fairly typical example.

Suppose the

22 FBI compiled an investigatory record for law enforcement
23 purposes; in other words, a record that clearly meets the
24 threshold test of Exemption 7.

And for simplicity's sake

25 let's assume that that record is two paragraphs long.

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, if there was a request for that record,

2 there’s no question that the FBI or any law enforcement
3 agency could refuse it under Exemption 7, assuming one of
4 the six harms could be shown.
5

Now, if instead the FBI were to xerox that record

6 or repeat it verbatim in a second record which was not
7 compiled for purposes of law enforcement, then the D.C.
8 Circuit would say it could still be withheld because it is
9 still the same record; it hasn’t been changed in any way.
10 However, if that second document rather than repeating the
11 two paragraphs verbatim repeated only one of those two
12 paragraphs, or repeated the two paragraphs but changed one
13 sentence in the two paragraphs or added a new sentence, or,
14 as in this case, instead of repeating the two paragraphs
15 verbatim it had summarized or paraphrased those two
16 paragraphs, then the D.C. Circuit would say at that point
17 it’s a new record, it has to be turned over, even though it
18 would contain the identical information that was in the two
19 paragraphs as it sat in its original source.
20

We don’t think that any test that could lead to

21 these sort of results could possibly be what Congress
22 intended when it intended in 1974 to wipe put the somewhat
23 formal interpretation of Exemption 7 that the D.C. Circuit
24 had given it.
25

And perhaps I can give another example that will
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 bring home the foolishness of the D.C. Circuit's approach in
2 this case.
3

The Respondent in this case made an FOIA request

4 for all of the documents that were sent over to the White
5 House in 1969 in response to the Ehrlichman request.

As a

6 result, what the FBI found were these name check summaries.
7 But let's assume instead Respondent had made a request in
8 1976 for all of the information in the FBI's files about
9 Cesar Chavez, for example, one of the eleven individuals.
10

What the FBI would have done is it would have gone

11 to its Cesar Chavez file, and it would have found two
12 things.

It would have found first the underlying

13 information that it had on Cesar Chavez, clearly exempt; and
14 it would have found the summaries that were prepared in 1969
15 which did nothing more than summarize the underlying
16 information that it had on Cesar Chavez.

Document E is

17 identical to Document A except it summarizes it.

The same

18 harms would occur from release of Document B that would
19 occur from the release of Document A.

It might well be a

20 serious invasion of Cesar Chavez's privacy.

Yet the D.C.

21 Circuit would require the FBI to turn over those summaries,
22 but would allow the FBI to retain the underlying records
23 that had been summarized.
24

Once again, we think that this could not possibly

25 be what Congress had in mind in 1974 when it intended to
21

^

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 wipe out and overrule the line of excessively literal
2 decisions of the D.C. Circuit under Exemption 7.
3

QUESTION:

What if I go to the FBI and ask them to

4 release anything they have in their files about me?

Are

5 they entitled to rely on the privacy exemption in turning
6 down my request if it's simply pertains to me?
7

HB. GELLEBt

Not if it simply pertains to you,

8 although if you ask for your own records, that's a
9 complication that’s not involved here, the Privacy Act would
10 apply as well as the Freedom of Information Act.

But a

11 person, no, would not be refused his own records under
12 Exemption 7(C).
13

In fact, in this case when Respondent's first

14 request came in and asked for information about eleven named
15 individuals, the FBI’s initial response was would you please
16 give us notarized statements from these eleven individuals
17 saying that they don't mind that we give out the information
18 on them.
19

Now, the hypothetical that I gave a moment ago is

20 not farfetched.

I think it’s almost exactly the situation

21 in this case with respect to the so-called attachments that
22 I mentioned at the beginning of this argument.
23

As I mentioned earlier, some of these attachments

24 are on their face quite clearly complete memoranda prepared
25 prior to 1969 pursuant to previous totally legitimate White
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 House name check requests.

These memos were in the FBI's

2 law enforcement files before the Ehrlichman request was
3 made, and they were incorporated in and attached to the
4 documents sent over to the White House in 1969 in response
5 to the Ehrlichman request.
6

The Court of Appeals remanded this aspect of the

7 case, the attachments aspect of the case, to the District
8 Court to determine whether these attachments were originally
9 compiled for law enforcement purposes.

If they were and if

10 the disclosure would work an unwarranted invasion of
11 personal privacy, then the Court of Appeals would allow the
12 FBI to withhold them.

However, if the FBI instead of

13 attaching these documents when they sent them over to John
14 Ehrlichman had instead summarized them, the same information
15 would be going over, but at that point the summaries could
16 not be withheld because they weren't the original documents,
17 and the court would have found that they were not prepared
18 for purposes of law enforcement.
19

And we think that this distinction between

20 duplicate law enforcement records and records that are
21 substantially identical but not exact duplicates is just the
22 sort of mechanical and senseless approach to Exemption 7
23 that Congress wanted to eliminate in the 1974 amendments.
24

I think this approach is responsive to none of the

25 concerns that underlie the exemption, and it would lead to
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

anomalous results, some of which I mentioned earlier.

The

2 harms that can occur from the release of a law enforcement

3 record can occur just as easily from the release of a
4 summary of that record, and those harms don't depend at all
5 on the purpose for which the summary was prepared.
6

He therefore think that the Court should reject

7 the D.C. Circuit's formal approach and literalistic approach
8 and

reverse the judgment below.

9

Thank you.
QUESTION*

10
11

Could the agency have relied also on

Exemption 5, had it chosen to do so, as an interagency piece

12 of information?

13

MB. GELLERs

Well, I don't think it could.

It's

14 interagency, but I don’t think Exemption 5 would apply
15 because it is not predecisional.

A lot of the material is

16 simply factual, and the courts have held that Exemption 5
17 doesn't apply to simply factual material.

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 now be exempt because the proposal, as I understand it,
2 changes the language of Exemption 7 to read "investigatory
3 records or information compiled for law enforcement
4 purposes" to make it clear that there should not be a
5 formalistic, literal focus on particular pieces of paper but
6 rather on what is the information that the law enforcement
7 agency is being asked to disclose.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHARON T. NELSON, ESQ.,

11

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

12

MS. NELSON»

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

13 the Court*
14

As you already heard, this is a Freedom of

15 Information Act case, and a case which certain deletions
16 from records prepared in 1969 pursuant to a request by John
17 Ehrlichman.

This request to prepare the summaries, the

18 so-called name check summaries, by the White House concerned
19 eleven prominent public figures.

The reason apparently that

20 Mr. Ehrlichman asked for this summary was because these
21 eleven individuals were publicly sponsoring a one-day
22 anti-Vietnam War moratorium along with four United States
23 Senators.

As has been mentioned, individuals in this list

24 include John Kenneth Galbraith and even Dr. Benjamin Spock.
25

QUESTION»

Why do you say "even?"
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MS. NELSON:

Well, I have to take a personal note

2 and say as a recent mother, Benjamin Spock is somehow put on

3 a different level.

But he was certainly a well-known

4 activist at that time and a well-known public figure even
5 not to mothers.
6

I think it's important here to clarify exactly

7 what is part of the 64-page record that was transmitted
8 pursuant to Ehrlichman's request.

9

QUESTION:

I'm not sure I get if there's any

10

significance to the fact that there were four United States

11

Senators who agreed with these people.

Does that have

12 anything to do with our case?

13

MS. NELSON:

No, but I think it does sort of lend

14 towards the way that these people were not exactly doing
15 something subversive to be investigated for, that they were
16 using their right of freedom of speech.
17

QUESTION:

Well, that might be relevant in a

18 tangential way if we were asked to pass on the propriety of
19 Mr. Ehrlichman's request, but that's not what we're dealing
20 with, is it?
21

MS. NELSON:

No.

What we are dealing with is the

22 fact —

QUESTION:

His conduct is not in issue here.

not in issue

2

MS. NELSON*

Oh, I think that Ehrlichraan’s conduct

3 is very much at issue here in the fact that these FBI files,
4 these summaries were prepared from the FBI files for a
5 purpose that was clearly not law enforcement.
6
7 issue.

QUESTION*

Well, I say his conduct is not in

If he had called the FBI and said conduct an

8 investigation on A, B, C, D, and E, that would be another
9 matter; but here we're dealing, as I understand the record,
10 with material that the FBI already had in its possession
11 about these people, is that right?
12

MS. NELSON*

I don't know.

I don't think the

13 record is clear as to whether Ehrlichman was aware of the
14 limitation of what the FBI was or was not going to do with
15 respect to obtaining information on the eleven people that
16 he —
17

QUESTION*

But is it not a fact that the

18 information — there was information already in the
19 possession and in the records of the FBI, just as there is,
20 for example, on Mr. Geller and probably on all of us sitting
21 on this bench?
22

MS. NELSON*

23

QUESTION*

24

MS. NELSON*

That is true.
And he was requesting that information.
He was requesting that the FBI

25 prepare summaries of information on these eleven
27
\

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

individuals.

It is not clear that he understood the

2 limitation of what type of information the FBI would use to
3 prepare those summaries.
4

QUESTIONS

But are we concerned in construing this

5 statute and the exemptions with what Hr. Ehrlichman had in
6 mind?
7

HS. NELSON*

I think, as both the District Court

8 and the Court of Appeals have held here, that it’s very
9 clear that these files were compiled for a partisan
10 political reason and not for a law enforcement purpose.

And

11 because of that, because of that exact reason —
12

QUESTION*

The summaries were compiled, the

13 summaries were compiled for political purposes is what they
14 found.
15

MS. NELSON*

That's correct.

There has been no

16 holding, neither at the District Court level nor at the
17 Court of Appeals, as to the reason or the purpose for which
18 the underlying information was originally compiled.

The

19 record is absolutely barren on that as to that issue, other
20 than affidavits that have been submitted by Petitioner.

But

21 the courts have made no ruling on this issue.
22

QUESTION:

Hell, I thought as to some of these

23 attachments didn't the Court of Appeals suggest they might
24 qualify, because they indeed had been put together for law
25 enforcement purposes?
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MS. NELSON;

I think the Court of Appeals stated

2 that — it remanded to the District Court to review and

3 determine what was the purpose that those underlying
4 documents were compiled.
5
6

QUESTION*

Yes, but the Court of Appeals did say

if it were found that those had been, the attachments had

7 been prepared for law enforcement purposes, then they would
8 qualify.

9

MS. NELSON*

10

QUESTION;

11

MS. NELSON*

12 believe,

13

That's correct.
And you don't dispute that, do you?
Well, the Court of Appeals was, I

using a very narrow use of the term "compile."
QUESTION;

Well, do you disagree with that phase

14 of the Court of Appeals holding?
15

MS. NELSON;

Well, we contend that when the FBI

16 rounded up new information and piled together this new
17 information and submitted it for a purpose other than law
18 enforcement purposes that that entire file, the entire
19 record, could not be exempt from disclosure under Exemption
20 7.

Information within might be exempt under another

21 exemption, but it could not be exempt under Exemption 7.
22

QUESTION;

Well, I'm still not clear, Ms. Nelson.

23 Do you or not agree with what the Court of Appeals held as
24 to the attachments?
25

MS. NELSON*

Well, we certainly agree that — we
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 certainly would not dispute if the Court would affirm the
2 Court of Appeals decision here.

We certainly can understand

3 that the word "compile" can be used to mean the researching
4 of information and the creation of a new document.

And we

5 believe that the Court of Appeals was using that definition
6 and felt that the attaching of a document was not the
7 creation of a new document.
8

QUESTION<

Well, if —

9

MS. NELSON*

I*m sorry.

10

QUESTION*

Go ahead and finish.

Excuse me.

11

MS. NELSON:

12

But obviously, the summaries that were created in

I*m sorry.

13 '69 — and these are sheets, you've seen two examples of the
14 shorter ones; some of the others are certainly longer -15 they certainly show without question that they were prepared
16 in

1969 pursuant to this request.

That was a creation of a

17 new document, and there is a question as to how you want to
18 use the word "compile."
19

QUESTION;

Well, what I'm referring to, Ms.

20 Nelson, I*m quoting now from the Court of Appeals opinion,
21 "If it is found that the attachment documents were already
22 in existence and a part of the FBI files prior to the White
23 House name check request, and those original documents were
24 sent to the White House as initially compiled and without
25 any modification, then a determination would have to be made
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

as to whether these documents meet the threshold

2 requirements of Section 7(B)."

3

Do you disagree with that?

4

MS. NELSON;

Well, as I said, we would prefer a

5 wider reading of the use of the word "compile," but we would
6 certainly not dispute that that is the holding that --

7

QUESTIONt

Well, you can’t argue.

We must judge

8 the case on that basis, mustn’t we, because you didn’t cross
9 appeal.
MS. NELSON;

10
11

Well, the reason that we did not

cross appeal —

12

QUESTION;

Well, it may be, but nevertheless,

13 that’s the ruling below, isn't it, that if these attachments
14 turn out to have been compiled for law enforcement, they're
15 exempt.
16

Don’t we judge the case on that basis?
MS. NELSON;

Well, there is some question, I

17 think, as to the exact language that the Court of Appeals
18 used here, and it can be read to say that it really did not
19 in fact rule on the issue of attachments and left that as an
20 open statement and giving some direction to it.
21

We did not cross appeal on that issue because we

22 felt that that was a reasonable reading of the word

23 "compiled."

As I say, we certainly feel that since it has

24 been — this Court has repeatedly held that the Freedom of
25 Information Act is a disclosure statute requiring the
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

broadest disclosure, that the use of the word "compiled” in

2 its most narrow term goes against the idea of using the

3 statute in its broadest sense for disclosure.

QUESTION;

Do I get an impression correctly that

12 if the statute had used the words

"initially secured for law

13 enforcement purposes" then you wouldn't have any claim to a

15

I don't know if I

If you're saying when the FBI in

22 this case would initially obtain the information,

that if at

23 that point they had done it for law enforcement purpose?
24 Well, one of the lower courts in the Lesar case held
25 basically in that case where the Government — where it was

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 shown that the original records that were obtained were
2 obtained for a non-law enforcement purpose, but the
3 Government went back into those files, those raw files, and
4 created a summary, and found that the summary that they
5 created was created for a law enforcement purpose \ and
6 decided, the court, and I believe correctly so, said that
7 those summaries that were created, which were created for a
8 law enforcement purpose, were in fact protected under

11 though, does it?

But that doesn’t help us much here,

Supposing you — let's ask it this

Supposing we had a document in the FBI files that was

9 White House for that document.

13

I would say not exempt.

I would say

Only original records in your reading

I would say it because the Congress

when it was adopting the amendments to Exemption 6 was doing

so in the wake of Watergate.

a tremendous concern of exactly the kind of abusive use of

And in today's world when it is easier to xerox or

make a photostatic copy of a document than to take the time

22 and energy to go through a document and only take those
23

portions which need be used, I think that if you hold in

your case that a photostat would at all times be protected,

then you're encouraging people —

The original — there is no question

4 even here that the original documents, the raw investigatory

Well, she's assuming the attachments

17 are the originals, which I think highly unlikely that they
18 would send the originals and keep photostats in their own
19 file.

But that's your assumption on which you go along with

20 the Court of Appeals, that they attached originals and
21 retained photostats.

No.

12

QUESTION;

13

MS. NELSON;

Let's stick to Exemption 7.
Seven goes to documents created for a

14 specific purpose, and whether or not that purpose —
15

QUESTION;

And you say only the originals are

16 created, and a photostat of an original is not a creation,
17 is that it?
18

MS. NELSON;

19 Court of Appeals.

I think that’s the argument of the

I mean that’s the decision of the Court

20 of Appeals.
21

QUESTION;

What’s your argument?

22

MS. NELSON;

Well, at this moment I haven’t cross

23 complained, you know, cross filed on their opinion and I’m
24 willing to stand behind their opinion.

I was just saying

25 that I think that from the congressional intent behind it,
36

1

it would seem that any time you reuse documents or

2 information,

whether or not they are photostatic copies, you

3 are reusing them for a purpose and —
4

QUESTION*

But, Ns. Nelson, that isn’t what

5 Exemption 7 — it doesn’t say created.

It says compiled,

6 investigatory records compiled for law enforcement purposes.

7

NS. NELSON:

8

QUESTION*

That is correct.

And I —

And you thought that "compiled”

9 normally applies to information rather than documents.
10

NS. NELSON*

11

QUESTION*

12

NS. NELSON*

No, Your Honor.
Well, that’s what you said.
I’m sorry.

13 issue is the word "compiled" here.

The word "compiled," the
What I said was that the

14 Court of Appeals used the word "compiled" in its narrow
15 sense of researching and creating a new document, whereas I
16 think the word "compiled" in its more modern term is used in
17 just pulling together information.
18

QUESTION*

Even though — so you would be

19 compiling a record — I guess you have to compile a record
20 before it’s within Exemption 7.
21

NS. NELSON*

22

QUESTION*

That’s correct.
And so you think you’re not compiling a

23 record if you make a photostat of an original and attach it.
24

NS. NELSON*

That’s the Court of Appeals decision,

25 and we are willing to —

QUESTIONS

2

NS. NELSON;

3

QUESTION;

4

MS. NELSON;

5

And that’s yours, too, isn't it?
— Stand behind that.
All right.
But in this case we’re not dealing

with the photostatic copies.

What we’re primarily first

6 dealing here with is the issue of the summaries that were
7

prepared in 1969, these summaries that were prepared for a

8 non-law enforcement purpose.
9

And this Court in NLRB v. Robbins Tire held that

10

as a threshold requirement to Exemption 7 must first

11

determine that the documents are investigatory records

12

compiled for a law enforcement purpose.

13

that, this Court reviewed extensively both the legislative

14

history and the clear meaning of the statute involved.

15

In this case it has been undisputed that the

16

summaries that were created in 1969 were created for a

17

non-law enforcement purpose.

18

held that these records were compiled for a partisan

19

political reason.
QUESTION;

20
21

And in deciding

Quite the contrary, it was

Perhaps this isn’t relevant, but I kno

that the Government makes something of it.

Do you have any

22 purpose you’re willing to tell us about for seeing these
23
24
25

documents?
MS. NELSON;

No.

In Respondent's first affidavit

that was filed with the Court — it’s not part of the Joint
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Appendix — he notes that he started this investigation
2 because one of the eleven individuals was running for the
3 United States Senate, and that individual felt that his
4 defeat was in part caused by a whispering campaign that he
5 felt was based on some information that the White House had
6 obtained.

And he gave the Respondent the cover letter which

7 is attached in the Joint Appendix at page 29, and it was
8 because of that that the Respondent submitted his Freedom of
9 Information Act request —
10

QUESTIONS

In other words. Respondent was more or

11 less acting on behalf of one of these eleven individuals?
12

MS. NELSON:

13

QUESTION:

I can't say on behalf.
Because as I understand what the

14 Government tells us, these eleven individuals, each could
15 have gotten the documents pertaining to himself without any
16 question.
17

MS. NELSON*

That is correct.

18 acting on behalf of one of those.

I cannot say he was

He was at that time a

19 journalist.
20

QUESTION*

But the Respondent's interest is

21 getting at the material that's in the nature of private
22 information pertaining to these people.
23

MS. NELSON*

The Respondent's interest is to find

24 out what kind of information that was being used by the
25 White House, and to determine in this case whether it was
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

part of the information that was used in this whispering

f

2 campaign.

3

Did I answer your question?

4

QUESTION*

Yes.

5

QUESTION;

I gather, Ms. Nelson, if I understand

6 your basic argument, it really is that even if they are
7 precise copies of documents originally put together,
8 compiled, or whatever word you want to use, for law
9 enforcement purposes, when later somebody wants copies of
10 those for some other purpose, they have to be disclosed.
11

MS. NELSON;

Nell, they cannot be shielded from

12 disclosure under Exemption 7.
13

QUESTION*

14

MS. NELSON;

It is always possible —

I am talking about Section 7.
Yes, but we cannot lose sight of the

15 fact that they may — some of the information may in fact be
16 protected under Exemption 6.
17

QUESTION;

Well, forgetting other exemptions, so

18 far as Exemption 7 is concerned am I correct that your
19 argument basically is even exact copies have to be disclosed
20 if the copies are wanted for some purpose other than the
21 original purpose which was law enforcement purposes?
22

MS. NELSON*

As I mentioned before, that is our

23 petition, but we are more than willing to just rely on the
„

24 Court of Appeals decision which does not go quite that far
25 as to disclosure, and would only go to when they’ve created

1

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

a new document

2

QUESTION;

Yes, but I think you can argue in the

3 District Court that a xerox is creating a new document, and
4 that the attachment isn’t protected unless it’s the
5 original, which you said earlier.
6

MS. NELSON*

I think what I said -- if we go back

7 now to the District Court and you affirm the Court of
8 Appeals decision, I think at that point we will probably not
9 raise the argument of whether or not they are or are not
10 xeroxed.

What we will however raise is the issue of whether

11 or not those attachments were in fact created for law
12 enforcement purposes.
13

It should be noted that out of the record, the

14 64-page record, there are only really attachments as to two
15 of the individuals, and as to two of the other individuals,
16 from what my brother said now, I gather also attachments,
17 there are no raw investigatory files attached.

The entire

18 record, the 64 pages, has been entered into the record as
19 Exhibit N, Document 3 of the record at the District Court
20 level .
21

QUESTION;

Ms. Nelson, you’ve used the word
a

22 "create" a number of times.

I think you had an exchange

23 with Justice White over "create" versus "compile.”
24 Actually, the statutory language of the exemption speaks
25 just of compile, does it not?
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MS. NELSON:

That’s correct.

I used only the word

2 '’create" in defining the word "compiled."

The issue is

3

whether or not the word "compile" requires the creation of a

4

new document or is just the pulling together of information.

5

QUESTION:

And you rely on the Court of Appeals

6 decision for the definition of "compiled" as opposed to
7

8
9

"create?"
MS. NELSON:

That’s right.

They basically use it

as to create a new document, and that’s why they, I believe,

10

felt that the attachments may not be — may still be

11

protected if in fact they were compiled for a law

12

enforcement purpose.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I would think you would be better

14

off with the broadest possible definition or rather perhaps

15

with the narrowest possible definition of the word

16

"compiled” since it’s an exemption.

17

QUESTION:

And of what a record was.

18

QUESTION:

And of what a record was.

19

MS. NELSON:

Well, we believe that it’s the terms

20 that would encourage the greatest amount of disclosure of
21

information, and that the words should — we should seek

22 those definitions that would encourage the greatest
23
24
25

disclosure.
QUESTION:

Well, I just meant from the point of

view of one seeking disclosure; you know, whether or not the
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

argument is accepted, the argument would be phrased in terms

2 of the narrowest possible definition of the exemption.
3

MS. NELSON:

4

I was going back to what this record really

5 includes.

That's correct. Your Honor.

In addition to the fact of these name check

6 summaries, this record includes attachments attached prior
7 to the name check summaries as to two of the individuals -8 or actually I gather four of the individuals — and it
9 includes a very lengthy article written by Mr. Galbraith in
10 the Saturday Evening Post, and also it includes the actual
11 advertisement that had been placed in the New York Times for
12 the anti-Vietnam War moratorium signed by the individuals.
13

QUESTION:

Well, your client doesn't need to go to

14 the F0IA to get that information.
15

QUESTION:

16

MS. NELSON:

Or to bother us with it.
Well, this is what was part of the

17 document.

The Respondent did not know exactly what was in

18 the file.

He did not know that the article from the

19 Saturday Evening Post was kept by the FBI as part of its
20 file on Mr. Galbraith.
21

Under Petitioners' argument that the record should

22 be shielded under Exemption 7 if its information was once
23 compiled for law enforcement purposes, it would shield
,

24 future records even if the information is recompiled for a
25 partisan political reason.

This position, of course.
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 totally dilutes the public accountability that Congress
2 meant to strengthen in the 1974 act amendment.
3

With respect to those amendments it’s important tc

4 note that the Senate floor manager of the 1974 amendments
5 stated on the floor of the Senate with respect to the soon
6 to be adopted amendment — this was back in *74 — and I
7 quote, "Not even the FBI should be placed beyond the law,
8 the Freedom of Information law.

Watergate has shown us that

9 unreviewability and unaccountability in government agencies
10 breeds irresponsibility of government officials."
11

As I say. Petitioners* position is at odds both

12 with the legislative history and with the statutory
13 construction.

Under Petitioners' position we basically

14 should — one would have to use two different ideas of
15 records.-

one record for the threshold test, whether or not

16 it was compiled for a law enforcement purpose; and other
17 records, the records that someone wants to be disclosed, for
18 the second test, the specific harm that might be done.
19

The problem, of course, is that Exemption 7 does

20 not talk in terms of two different records.

In talks in one

21 record, and it is very clear that they are not accepting —
22 the statute is very clear that it's just one record to be
23 reviewed and to be determined.
24

In addition, their position is totally

25 unworkable.

It would add a greater burden on the courts and
44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

>

1 the agencies to determine.

As I’ve mentioned, the lower

2 courts have not yet decided on what the original purpose for
3 the information was when being compiled.

And even

4 Petitioners' documents show that they have been unable to
5 find the actual source of all the information in question,
6 as noted in affidavits that they have submitted and included
7 in the Joint Appendix at page 19.
8

QUESTIONS

Hay I ask another question about the

9 word, the statutory word "records?"

Does that word include

10 information stored in a computer data bank just with
11 electronic signals?
12

HS. NELSON:

Well, as my brother mentioned

13 earlier, the word "record" is nowhere defined in the Freedom
14 of Information Act.
15

QUESTION;

Well, under your interpretation we

16 don’t count photostats.

I just wonder if we count

17 electronic signals that enable one to produce copies.
18

QUESTION;

On that basis any time you had a

19 printout you would create a new document in your approach.
20

QUESTION;

That’s why I asked the question.

21

HS. NELSON;

It's very difficult.

I think the

22 reason that the term "record" is defined the way it is in
23 the Privacy Act is the Privacy Act was specifically looking
24 at computers, considering computers when it was passed.

But

25 yes, I would say every time you push that button and print
45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

out that sheet, you created a new record.

2

QUESTION;

A new record.

Therefore, it would

3 appear to me that nothing — no computerized information
4 would ever be exempt from disclosure.
5

QUESTION;

Whether it was compiled for — whether

6 it was on there for law enforcement purposes or not.

7

QUESTION;

8 meaning of the act,

It wouldn't be a record within the
and the exemption only applies to

9 records.
10
11

MS. NELSON;

Well, I think in an earlier case that

was argued here —

12

QUESTION;

Unless you could send it over to

13 somebody else's computer by pushing the Send button.
14

MS. NELSON;

Do that, or computer information is

15 also transmitted by just exchanging the discs that the
16 information is on.
17

QUESTION;

I don't think you or I know what is on

18 the computer at the FBI.

I don't think we do.

I know I

19 don't.
20

MS. NELSON;

21

(Laughter.)

22

MS. NELSON;

I know I don't.

I think it's important here to note

23 that the Petitioners made a conscientious litigation
24 decision not to raise Exemption 6.

They have attempted to

25 change Exemption 7 into a broad privacy exemption in their
46

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 argument of privacy.

Exemption 6 is a privacy exemption.

2 As mentioned, they did originally raise it when they
3 originally refused to give the Respondent any access to any
4 of the documents, but they did not raise it at the District
5 Court level.

And after the District Court ruled that the

6 information was not compiled for law enforcement purposes,
7 and instead of releasing the information at that time gave
8 Petitioners another chance to show that the information was
9 in fact exempt under the Freedom of Information Act,
10 Petitioners still did not raise Exemption 6.
11

QUESTION*

You don't suggest that an invasion of

12 personal privacy has nothing to do with Exemption 7, do you?
13

MS. NELSON*

Oh, there's no question that the

14 sub-part of Exemption 7 does talk in terms of invasion of
15 privacy.

It's a question of a standard.

The Exemption 7,

16 you must first reach the threshold question.

If you're just

17 dealing with privacy, Exemption 6 does not require the
18 threshold question of it being compiled for law enforcement
19 purposes.
20

QUESTION*

No.

It has a higher standard.

It’s

21 got to be clearly —
22

MS. NELSON*

But it is a higher standard, and as

23 Petitioner did finally shed light onto why they might not
24 have raised Exemption 6 earlier, it is a higher standard?
25 and it's a higher standard to be considered.

When you're

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

talking about eleven public figures, some of whom are no

2 longer living, individuals; when the Petitioners made no
3

attempt to ascertain whether or not any of these individuals

4

are concerned about the disclosure that are in the question;

5

where it's shown, as I mentioned, that Respondent began this

6

investigation — began his search for this information

7

because of one of the eleven individuals making him aware of

8 the file, which Petitioners have been aware of; and the fact
9

that there is no — we don’t know whether or not the

10

information in these files have already been included --

11

been dispersed into the public domain — as I mentioned

12 earlier, there’s a question of how some of this information
13

was used, and if it was in fact used previously, it was

14

dispersed already.

15

Respondent has no way of deciding what this

16

information is without seeing the information.

17

viewed this information in camera.

18

only understand that it must not reach that higher standard

19

of Exemption 6 type of privacy.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.

24

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

25

MR. GELLER;

Just one or two things, Mr. Chief
48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

Justice
First, in terms of whether the information was

3 compiled for purposes of law enforcement, FBI agent Donohoe
4 submitted two affidavits, and they are reprinted in the
5 Joint Appendix, and on pages 18 and 19 he said that he
6 traced all of the information in these name check summaries
7 to records in the FBI’s law enforcement files.
8

QUESTION:

We certainly judged the case on the

9 basis that they were.
10

MR. GELLER:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. GELLER:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.
Originally.
That's right.
Because it didn't make any difference

14 to the Court of Appeals.
15

MR. GELLER:

Well, that's right, but it's not

16 necessarily a presumption you have to indulge in.

There's

17 actually evidence, unrebutted evidence in the file.
18

And second, I'd like to just point out the irony

19 of the Respondent's interpretation of the FOIA here.

If

20 John Ehrlichman had had a law enforcement purpose for making
21 this 1969 request, then all of the information sent over to
22 him in 1969, including the name check summaries, presumably
23 would have been compiled for law enforcement purpose and
24 could be withheld.

However, since the District Court found

25 that John Ehrlichman was instead motivated by a desire to
49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

invade people's privacies for reasons unrelated to lav

2 enforcement, the result is that the FBI now has to open up

3 all of its files about these people's privacy to any FOIA
4 requestor who asks to see them.

It does not make a great

5 deal of sense.
6

Finally, in terms of the underlying purposes of

7 the FOIA and whether they would be served by the
8 Respondent's interpretation here, we think it's important to

9 point out that in response to the Respondent's FOIA request,
10 he learned of the John Ehrlichman request, he got a copy of
11

the letter that the FBI sent to John Ehrlichman in response

12 to that request, he got virtually all of the documents that

13 were sent over from the FBI to the White House in 1969.

The

14 only thing we’re debating here is whether certain small
15 snippets of this information, the disclosure of which would
16 cause one of the specific harms listed in Exemption 7, must
17 be disclosed.
We think that the threshold test is clearly met

18

19 here, and Judge Ritchie found that Exemption 7(C) was also
20 met.
21

We therefore think that the FBI was entitled to

withhold this information.

22

Thank you.
