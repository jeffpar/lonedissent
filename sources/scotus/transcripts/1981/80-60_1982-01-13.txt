ORAL ARGUMENT OF NEAL S. DUDOVITZ, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. DUDOVITZ:

8
9

the Court, the case before you today presents this Court

10 with familiar
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

concepts, a federal-state cooperative program,

federal regulatory issues, and specific elements of the

12 Medicaid

statute.

13

Petitioners are a class of poor persons from the

14 state of Iowa
15 for nursing
16 disobey
17 Medicaid

who are being deprived of Medicaid benefits

home care solely because Iowa has chosen to

federal Medicaid regulations.

The heart of the

problem here involves a determination of the amount

18 of money available to an institutionalized spouse from a
19 non-institutionalized spouse in determining benefit
20 eligibility.
21

This process is called deeming, and of course

it is the very same process confronted by this Court last

22 term in its decision in Schweiker v.
23

Gray Panthers.

Whether or not deeming is employed for spouses

24 separated by institutionalization of course often results in
25 critical life decisions for members of the petitioner

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 class.

As a majority of this Court noted in Gray Panthers,

2 many individuals in need of medical care are forced by
3 deeming to choose between abandoning an institutionalized
4 spouse and living in poverty.

This dilemma is at the core

5 of the present controversy.
6

This case, like that in Gray Panthers, revolves

7 around the validity of the federal regulations that
8 determine when a state such as Iowa may deem income between
9 spouses separated by institutionalization.

Contrary to the

10 plaintiffs in Gray Panthers, petitioners in this case are
11 not attacking the validity of the federal regulations.
12 Instead, it is the respondent Iowa who now claims, despite
13 their acceptance of federal moneys, that they are not bound
14 by the Secretary’s regulations.
15
16

Iowa argues it may make its own deeming rules,
directly contrary to the federal regulations, and still be

17 reimbursed by the federal government for Medicaid payments.
18 Petitioners maintain, on the other hand, that the federal
19

regulations are a valid exercise of the Secretary’s

20 authority granted to him by Congress, and the federal
21 government, as stated in their amicus brief filed herein,
22 agrees with petitioners that Iowa’s Medicaid rules must be
23 changed in order to comply with the federal regulations.
24

The analysis which this Court must employ in

25 evaluating this controversy was set forth by the Court in
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 its decision last term in Gray Panthers.

The regulations at

2 issue in this case are promulgated under the exact same
3 statutory authority for which the regulations of Gray
4 Panthers were promulgated.
5

In the Gray Panthers case, this Court ruled that

6 the section of the Medicaid Act under which the Secretary
7 was acting both in Gray Panthers and here amounted to
8 Congress's granting to the Secretary the power to make
9 regulations that have legislative effect.

The Court

10 therefore applied its previous decision in Batterton v.
11 Francis, in order to determine the validity of the
12 regulations.
13

The Batterton test requires that the regulations be

14 upheld unless they are either arbitrary or capricious, or
15 beyond the authority granted the Secretary by Congress.
16

It

is important to note that neither the district court in this

17 case nor Judge Ross writing for half of the Eighth Circuit
18 followed the Batterton test.

The only group of judges that

19 did was the second half of the Eighth Circuit, in an opinion
20 written by Judge McMillian, who followed the Batterton test,
21 and came out on the same side as petitioners are herein,
22 indicating that the regulations must stand and Iowa's rules
23 must fall.

24

The practical implications of the Batterton-Gray

25 Panther test are that this Court must focus on the
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 reasonableness of the Secretary's regulations.

It is not

2 the duty of this Court to interpret the statute to see if
3 there is another way to read the statutes, nor is it the
4 duty of this Court under Batterton and Gray Panthers to
5 compare Iowa's interpretation or the Secretary's to
6 determine whose might seem most reasonable.
7

The question is not really whether Iowa's policy is

8 reasonable, which is what Iowa seems to want to argue to
9 this Court.

The only issue is whether the Secretary's

10 regulations are reasonable.

If they are, then they must

11 stand, and Iowa must be forced to follow them.
12

The Gray Panthers decision is not, however,

13 controlling on the ultimate merits of this case, for the
14 reason that the regulations at stake in Gray Panthers
15 ultimately did not apply to the state of Iowa.
16

Under the statutory authority of the Medicaid Ret

17 that we are concerned with, the Secretary issued, in a
18 sense, two sets of regulations, one that applied to states
19 which have been called the 209(b) states, and another set of
20 regulations that apply to the SSI states.

At stake in Gray

21 Panthers were the regulations applicable to the 209(b)
22 states; at stake here are the regulations applicable to the
23 SSI states.
24

That distinction is what produces the critical

25 difference in this case.

1

QUESTION;

Mr. Dudovitz, did Mrs. Herweg’s family

2

apply on her behalf for SSI benefits before applying for

3

Medicaid ?
MR. DUDOVITZ;

4

The record reflects that she did not

5

apply before, and I think the briefs will note that there is

6

some question about whether or not she in fact ever was an

7

SSI recipient.

8

to the appendix in this case is the decision of the Iowa

9

Department of Social Services on the Herwegs, and they note

However, the Court will note that attached

10

in that decision that as of June -- they had received notice

11

that as of June, 1977, she was going to receive SSI.
QUESTION;

12
13

Is there a reason why no application was

made on her behalf?
MR. DUDOVITZ;

14

I actually do not know the answer to

15

why she did not make an application.

It is my understanding

16

that she would have been eligible after the first month that

17

she moved out of the home.
The difference between the 209(b) and SSI

18
19

distinctions, as I said, is critical here.

The 209(b)

20

option, as this Court noted in Gray Panthers, was created by

21

Congress essentially at the behest of the states because the

22

states did not want to be bound by what we have called the

23

SSI link.

24

1396(a)(10)(a), requires that a state provide Medicaid

25

benefits to all SSI recipients.

That link, that part of the statute,

This link to categorical

programs, that is, linking Medicaid eligibility to

existed in the Medicaid program from its

inception.
The critical difference, though, that occurred in

1972 was the adoption by Congress of the SSI program.

to that time, the states were able to control many of the

to link eligibility to those programs did not --

10 still allowed the states to have substantial control over
11

the eligibility conditions.
By federalizing the age, blind, and disabled in

12

13 SSI, Congress created the eligibility conditions

That would have resulted in

States had a voluntary choice to make.
Iowa chose to be bound by the SSI rules.

Iowa

23 chose to follow the SSI rules for Medicaid eligibility, as,
24 of course,
25

did a majority of the states.

It is important to remember that the link then

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

assures that all SSI people, all people who are so poor that

2

they need cash assistance, will also get corresponding

3 medical benefits,
4

and it attaches to Medicaid the

eligibility conditions for those benefits that Congress

5 crafted

in the SSI statute.
QUESTION*

6

7 which is, if

Mr. Dudovitz, may I ask you a question,

we were to reverse in this case, and give

8 effect to the Secretary's regulation,
9

would states still be

able to collect money from the spouse who is not

10 institutionalized for reimbursement to the state under some
11

state relative responsibility law, in your view?

12

MR. DUDOVITZ;

Yes, absolutely.

13 here and

the SSI rules say nothing about the state's powers

14 under its relative responsibility laws.
15 Secretary has noted a number of
16 free to exercise their rights,

QUESTION*

19

MR. DUDOVITZ*

20 have such a
21

Does Iowa have such a law?
It is my understanding Iowa does

law.

The particular SSI eligibility rules that are being

22 brought to

the Medicaid program through the link here, the

23 deeming rules,

are simply that spouses when they live

24 together must have

their income included together, and when

25 only one spouse is an eligible spouse,

there is only one

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

spouse is applying for benefits, that deeming must cease

2

after the first month.

3 requires that their

When two spouses are applying, SSI

income be considered together for six

4

months, and correspondingly, the Secretary requires that

5

same six-month deeming in the Medicaid program.
Iowa admittedly does not follow that rule, and

6
7

admits that they are directly and specifically in violation

8

of those regulations.
The Secretary's regulations, then, in our view,

9
10

when evaluated, that is, that regulation bringing the one

11

month and six month rule over from SSI to Medicaid, when

12

evaluated under the Batterton-Gray Panthers test which this

13 Court has established balance the overall policies of the
14

Medicaid program, that is, the attached -- assuring that

15 categorical
16 Section
17

eligible people, SSI people, get Medicaid, with

17(b) and (d) of the Medicaid Act, that give the

Secretary the power to determine what income is available

18 and

talk about the limited exception to deeming for spouses

19 and

parents to children.

20
21

The regulations recognize therefore that Section
(d), the authorization for the limited deeming, and I think

22 it is important again

to note that this Court recognize that

23 Congress generally

was opposed to deeming but allowed a

24 limited exception,

recognize that (d) is such a limited

25 exception,

but it also recognized that the subsequent
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 enactment by Congress of the SSI program in 1972 amounted to
2 a modification of Section (d), such that (d) could not be
3 used to deprive SSI recipients of benefits.
4

QUESTIONS

Mr. Dudovitz, let me ask, does your

5 class encompass both the categorically and the optional
6 categorically needy?
7

MR. DUDOVITZ t

Yes, it does.

There is no

8 distinction in the class between the two.
9

QUESTIONS

Does the regulation that was struck down

10 apply only to the optional categorically needy?
11

MR. DUDOVITZs

It is my understanding that the

12 regulation would apply to everyone about the SSI recipients
13 and the optionals.

It is important to recognize that as I

14 think both our brief and the brief the federal government
15 points out, that the optional categorical people are in
16

effect categorical people/ and that the federal government

17 has always applied the same rules to all of them, and the
18 Secretary has always understood that it was the intent of
19 Congress that they be treated the same, again, recognizing

20 that the optionals was a voluntary choice by the state of
21 Iowa.

They did not have to choose to cover those people,

22 but that was their choice to do so.
23

The Secretary’s regulations then are no more

24 restrictive than the SSI deeming rules which the same states
25 have to use, and it is in our view the only way to assure

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the SSI link has effect.

Iowa, to our knowledge, is by

2 itself in its interpretation of

these rules and statutes.

3

The only other state to our knowledge that has ever argued

4

that they can ignore these deeming rules was the state of

5

Florida, and as I think we noted in our briefs, in the

6 Griswold case the federal district
7

from undertaking their view.

8 always agreed

The federal government has

with the position of the petitioners.

Simply that -- the simple question is, if Iowa can

9

10 do what it is trying to do here, if it can be an

SSI state,

11

but then pick and choose which SSI rules it wants to use in

12

the Medicaid program, it effectively emasculates the link

13

and deprives the federal government of any opportunity to

14

control the Medicaid program, for which it is the primary

15

fun der.

16

Another interesting point in this case is that

17

again if you look at the Department of Social Services'

18

decision attached to the appendix in this case, you will

19

note that there were two federal SSI rules brought over to

20 the Medicaid program which
21

herweg case.

were at stake initially in the

One was the deeming question, and the other

22 was the income disregards question.
23
24
25

That is, how much of

Mr. Herweg's income would be disregarded under the SSI rules
Iowa chose to change that also initially, but in
its decision on the Herwegs' case, it reversed itself.
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

It

1 said, we are bound to follow the SSI income rules for the
2 Herwegs.

Therefore, we have to use the SSI exemptions, but

3 we are not bound to follow the SSI deeming rules.
4 Petitioners submit that makes no sense under a federal-state
5 cooperative program.
6

Iowa has made a few arguments that I wish to deal

7 with on this point.

One, they have implied that there is

8 somehow some inherent power in the state of Iowa to do
9 deeming through the Medicaid program.

As I indicated in

10 response to Justice O'Connor’s question, Iowa's inherent
11 power to the extent it exists is found in the relative
12 responsibility laws.
13

The Medicaid program is a federal-state cooperative

14 program.

Iowa doesn’t have any inherent powers there.

What

15 a federal-state cooperative program does is, Congress says
16 that these are the rules.

If you want to use federal money,

17 you have to agree to follow the rules, and Congress
18 determines who has the power to set the rules.
19

It seems clear here that they have given the

20 Secretary the power in this area.

Section 17(d) is not

21 mandatory, and again is modified by Congress’s subsequent
22 enactment of the link.

I think it is again important to

23 recognize that in evaluating federal-state cooperative
24 programs like the Medicaid program and the AFDC program,
'4

25 this Court must look at the overall policy and intent of

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Congress, as Justice Rehnquist noted in the Filberg case.

2

It is not just one sentence or one word that is important

3

here.

And there is no question that the overall policy is

4
5

It is the entire overall policy.

to ensure that SSI recipients receive Medicaid.
The second major point that I think Iowa tries to

6
7

make is, they try to argue that the SSI program does not

8

actually require that there be no deeming after one month,

9

and they imply that that is in fact the Secretary's idea

10

rather than Congress's.
In SSI, however, Congress specifically in statute

11
12

set forth in great detail most of the eligibility rules.

13

Not only did they talk about only deeming in one-month and

14

six-month times, but in Section 1382(a)(2), where they

15

define unearned income once people are separate, for people,

16 or for all persons/ I should say, including when people are
17

separated, they indicated that support and maintenance can

18

be considered unearned income only if supplied in cash or in

19

kind.

20

It is not the Secretary, but it is Congress that

21

set forth these SSI deeming rules that the Secretary has now

22

brought over to the Medicaid program by virtue of the link

23

and his authority under 17(b).

24

perfectly reasonable for the Secretary, balancing all these

25

interests, to use Congress's enacted eligibility conditions

It seems to me that it is

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in the Medicaid program as a way to effectuate the link.
2

If there are no other questions, I will save the

3 remainder of my time for rebuttal, Your Honor.
4

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Before you

5 proceed, counsel, let me inform you and waiting counsel that
6 it now appears that Mr. Justice Marshal cannot get through
7 because of traffic conditions and snow, and he will
8 participate in these cases on the basis, of course, of all
9 the briefs that are filed for the record and on the tape
10 recording of the oral argument.
11

He reserves that right.

Mr. Appel, you may proceed when you are ready.

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRENT R. APPEL, ESQ.,

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

14

MR. APPEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

15 Members of the Court, in addition to responding to whatever
16 questions you may have, I think it would be most helpful if
17 I focus on four general areas of this case.
18

First, I think we have to understand precisely what

19 the regulation under question here does.

20 following proposition.

It stands for the

If I am a wealthly lawyer earning

21 $100,000 a year, and I have a spouse who for whatever
22 medical reason needs to be institutionalized in a skilled
23 24-hour a day nursing home, a person representing the Iowa
24 Department of Social Services cannot deem my income
i

25 available to the spouse that is institutionalized beyond a

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

one-month period.

The only alternative for the state of

2

Iowa is to use spousal responsibility statutes that Justice

3

O'Connor referred to.
With respect to those spousal responsibility

4
5

statutes, I would like to point out that the Court in Gray

6

Panthers was rather explicit in outlining how impractical

7

resort by administrative agencies like that Iowa Department

8

of Social Services to spousal responsibility statutes are.

9

There are difficulties of obtaining service, there is a

10

protracted litigation, and it is almost not worth the --

11

sometimes.
QUESTION*

12

But in the example that you are giving,

13

of course, of the wealthy non-institutionalized spouse, that

14

shouldn't pose such a problem, should it?

1

Secondly, I would like to clarify models of

2 adjudication that are really — really at issue here, and
3 the petitioners and the state of Iowa have distinctly
4 different models.
5 model.

The petitioners have a legislative effect

Basically what they are saying is that Health and

6 Human Services has kind of sketched in the details of the
7 Congressional statute, and that therefore the regulation
8 involved is entitled to legislative effect.
9

The theory that you are all, of course, familiar

10 with is that specialized agencies ought to fill in those
11 gaps.

This Court doesn't sit as kind of a super-agency to

12 review closed decision-making.

But Iowa has a distinctly

13 different model.
14

Iowa's model is the ultra vires model that says

15 that the Secretary of HHS in creating this one-month iron
16 curtain on deeming is not sketching in detail, but is
17 totally outside the Congressional framework, and as a result
18 of that this is an area where courts traditionally police
19 the agencies, and since the regulation involved is invalid,

20 it has no effect from the beginning, and Iowa is not in
21 violation of any valid regulation promulgated by the
22 Secretary.
23

So, those are the two models that I think are

24 distinctly different, and that may give the case some focus.

25

Let me share with you some of the reasons why Iowa
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

believes the ultra vires model is more applicable than the

2

legislative effect model.

3

itself. Section 17(b) and (d) of the Medicaid program

4

itself.

First, we go to the statute

5

Basically what this statutory framework says is

6

that the states must promulgate reasonable standards for

7

Medicaid; 17(b) notes that the state can only consider

8

available income "according to standards prescribed by the

9

Secretary", and then 17(d) talks about spousal deeming of

10

income, and basically 17(d) says that other than spouses you

11

can’t deem income because consanguity isn’t close enough,

12

but spouses is authorized.

13

But in Gray Panthers, if you read the case

22

carefully, it states clearly that unless you construe 17(d)

23

to mean states, you can deem spousal income, it would be

24

literally stricken from the statute.

25

Secondly, in Gray Panthers there is a gloss of

I don't want to protract that, but one

2 of the Senate committee reports that is cited there states
3 that it is proper to expect spouses to support each other.
4 I think that comports fairly with our everyday experience.
5

Secondly, let me point out the Secretary has not

6 promulgated a standard, really.

Iowa's position is that it

It has no connection at all with the

8 availability of income, how much money the other spouse is
9 making, what the obligations of the other spouse might be on
10 the strength of the marriage relationship.
QUESTION:

11

Would Iowa object to any time limitation

12 that the Secretary might impose on deeming?
MR. APPEL:

13

I think it would be conceivable that a

14 time limitation would be appropriate if it could be shown
15 that it had some kind of rational relationship with
16 expectations of spousal support.

If the Secretary in notice

17 and comment in the Federal Register said, listen, we have
18 decided that after six years or five years the family
19

obligation dilutes, or practical experience shows that we

20 just can't enforce it — strike that.

I don't mean to say

But experience shows us that somehow the family

You can have a stringent standard of review in

9 irrational.

QUESTION;

10

Hasn’t Congress delegated to the

11

Secretary, though, the precise power, and doesn't that mean

12

that the Secretary's -- Congress’s directive has been

13 effectively ignored, if you are

I think Congress — Congress's

the context not only of

17(b), which says standards, but 17(d) as well.

17 think

I don't

that Congress intended for the Secretary to be able to

18 use a one-month cutoff that has no relationship whatever to
19 spousal responsibility.

In effect what that does is through

20 regulation draw a dotted line through
21

17(d) of the statute,

and I think that is ultra vires.

22

The Secretary clearly has power to prescribe

23 standards, and draw

the lines.

Those lines are

Iowa could not come before

QUESTION:

But four judges below are against you.

8 They at least thought it was sufficiently ambiguous to vote

9 the other way.
MR. APPEL:

10

11

Well, the reason for that,

that they misapplied the Batterton test.

12 test,

I think, is

The Batterton

I would suggest, is not applicable in this precise

13 setting.

Why is it not applicable?

First, in Batterton --

14 Batterton is an interesting case, and it somewhat tracks the
15 case, but let me distinguish it while it is open to the
16 Court.
17

Batterton, as I am sure you will recall, was a case

18 that involved unemployment benefits, and the Health and
19 Human Services had a regulation which allowed states to
20 disqualify families from AFDC benefits if the father
21

became

unemployed because of illegal activity that might have

22 disqualified the father from unemployment benefits under

23 state law, unlawful strike, that kind of thing.
24

And the Batterton case made a couple of

25 observations.

First, it noted that there was no indication

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

in the statutory language or history that this factor could

2 not be taken into account.
3 425.

That is at 430 — 432 U. S.

Au contraire here, here we have the express 17(d),

4 which has been held
5 than that,

that it allows spousal deeming.

Other

it is going to get stricken -- it is stricken

6 from the statute.

And so therefore it is distinguishable

7 there.
8

Second, in Batterton it was conceded that the

9 Secretary could not adopt a regulation

that has no

10 meaningful relationship to any recognized concept of
11

unemployment or that would defeat the purposes of Medicaid.

12 Let me put this in

the context of the present case.

13 meaningful relationship does this one-month
14 toward the availability of

What

window have

income of the

15 non-institutionalized spouse to the other?

Not yet in this

16 case has that regulation been defended on the ground that
17 is some kind of reasonable interpretation of what is
18 available or not.
19

The only ground that has been asserted is that

20 because it is used
21

in SSI, therefore it has to be used in

SSI states under Medicaid, so there is kind of an

22 administrative

jump but nowhere is a rational relationship

23 shown between a one-month window and deeming policy
24 generally.
25

QUESTION:

You agree that Batterton did hold that

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

it

the original judgment was for the Secretary, and that the

2

court should set it aside only if it was unreasonable or

3 irrational?
4

MR. APPEL:

5

QUESTION;

6

Or exceeded the statutory authority.
Exceeded statutory authority, not simply

because the court might have thought it would come down with

7 a different regulation if it had been entrusted with that
8

authority?

9

MR. APPEL;

Well, I think that the different models

10

have to be kept in place.

Sure, that is precisely what the

11

Court said.

12

whether or not a regulation is outside the Congressional

However, it seems to me that the judgment of

13 framework, specifically where you have the clear 17(d)
14 authorization, is something far different than the line
15 drawing that otherwise occurs in the guts of administrative
16 statutes that this Court construes daily.
QUESTION;

17

General Appel, may I ask you a question

18 to be sure I understand your argument?

Am I correct in

19 believing that the same deeming regulation is used to
20

determine eligibility for SSI benefits as for the Medicaid

21

benefits?

The one-month rule, and so on.

22

MR. APPEL;

23

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct.

Yes.

approach that has been taken by HHS under SSI.

That means if they are separated we can't deem
Query whether that is correct, but that is the

And what the petitioners' argument is, as I

14
15

understand it, is that because that is what goes on under

16

SSI, that is what has got to happen under Medicaid.
QUESTION:

17

But are you arguing that it is arbitrary

18

for the Secretary to impose that requirement, but arguably

19

with respect to SSI Congress imposed the requirement and the

20 same standard of arbitrariness doesn't apply to Congress as
21

it does to the Secretary?
MR. APPEL:

22

Is that the --

Well, I think that's right.

I think

23

that Congress frankly in legislating can be as arbitrary as

24

it wants.

25

QUESTION:

Congress can act arbitrarily, but the
25

2

MR. APPEL:

3

QUESTION:

Well, I think that's correct.
I mean, that is basically what you are

4 saying to us.
5

MR. APPEL;

6

QUESTION:

I think that —
Because if it is arbitrary, I suppose it

7 is arbitrary whoever imposed the requirement.
MR. APPEL:

8

I am saying that in this discussion,

9 but I don’t think it is critical to the guts of Iowa's case,
10 which again

rotates around the fact that 17(d) expressly

11

allows the states to salvage some kind of deeming policy,

12

subject, to be sure, subject to whatever standards the

13 Secretary might set for what is acceptable deeming.
I might note that in Norman v. St. Claire, which is

14

15 admittedly a circuit court case, but it describes some of
16 the history of what occurred prior to the passage of some of
17 these consolidating statutes, and indeed, in all the states,
18 under the Kerr-Mills program, you had all different kinds of
19 formulae for deeming, and they are in all different
20 directions,
21

and the idea was to kind of consolidate these

together and get one general parameter of where deeming was

22 allowed.

That is the standard that the Secretary should

23 promulgate.

The Secretary should come out and say, listen,

24 again, here is a matrix, like in Dandridge — or Rosaldo
25 actually has the matrix.

Here is a matrix of the standard

Beyond a certain threshold, you can’t deem

2 states.

Let's get it all together.

3

But again, we are writing out 17(d) of the statute

4 out of the Medicaid statute.
5

I want to point out the difference, too, between

6 Medicaid and SSI.

SSI, as the Court is aware, is a federal

7 program, totally federal funded, has a much different
8 philosophy than Medicaid.
9 state program.

The Medicaid is a cooperative

The states are entitled -- are in fact

10 directed to establish plans with all kinds of options and
11 discretions and so forth.

That is what Section 17 is all

12 about.
13

Now, by passing SSI, it seems to me Congress did

14 not intend to take the state discretion expressly given in
15 17(d) for deeming out of the Medicaid program.
16

Let me point out this 209(b) matter that has been

17 raised with the Court.

It has been suggested in the briefs

18 that Iowa is trying to get in the back door.
19

QUESTION;

Well, if you win this case, I take it

20 that Iowa couldn’t change its mind and —
21

MR. APPEL;

Iowa could go back and become a 209(b)

22 state, yes, if it chose.
23

QUESTION;

But as long as it is a 209(b) state, it

24 may not -- it may not take the course the Secretary says it

19

So if Iowa or any other

these cases, it is coming out of social services generally.

I don’t know whether the expenses would be worth --

5 the Court in Gray Panthers I thought was rather clear on
6

that point.
A few other miscellaneous observations, if I may.

8

Again I want to stress the narrowness of this case.

We are

9 not challenging the whole SSI and Medicaid concept.

If

10

Congress tomorrow passes a statute that adds another

11

category to SSI benefits generally, we are moving right

12 along.

Iowa will adopt it because it is an SSI state.

If

13 Congress adds five categories tomorrow, Iowa will move right
14 along.

It is an SSI state.
The only thing we are saying is that the Medicaid

15

16 statute expressly allows us to do spousal deeming, and we
17 want to do so in a reasonable fashion.

To hold otherwise is

18 really a repeal of 17(d) by implication, if we allow the

4 Panthers, that provides that relatively wealthy spouses will
5 not have an opportunity to slide out of their Medicaid
6 obligations.

It focuses our dollars.

And, you know,

7 whatever the financial impact is on this case, it is going
8 to mean there is less money for something else.
9

Maybe Iowa will have to abandon its policy of

10 having optional needy with Medicaid.

Maybe Iowa goes back

11 to a 209(b) state if the pressures get so great, which we
12 think is an undesirable policy, because of the lowered
13 eligibility, and because of the impact it would have on
14 minor children.

We don't want to be a 209(b) state,

15 emphatically.
16

But we think that the policy adopted by the

17 Secretary of HHS simply is contrary to the statutory
18 framework.

It is contrary to 17(d) of the statute.

What this Court held is that the Secretary must allow at

22 times that there be deeming.
23

The second important distinction is, what we were

24 dealing with or what this Court was dealing with
25 Panthers decision and interpreting

(b) and

in the Gray

(d) was what

34

1 Congress intended in 1965, when it enacted the Medicaid
2 program.

Again, Congress modified the Medicaid program a

3 number of times, particularly in 1972, when they dealt with
4 the change of the link and how its effect is on the SSI
5 program.
6

By doing that, essentially, Congress almost in some

7 sense said that the legislative history at the time (b) and
8 (d) were adopted did not quite have the same meaning.

So

9 even if it might have been stronger in 1965, the requirement
10 of the link to the SSI program, which no one seems to deny
11 here, essentially modifies it.

It makes it clear the

12 Secretary is reasonable in saying, look, you can deem
13 sometimes.

And remember, Iowa can deem sometimes.

In fact,

14 it can deem to the extent that the Congress found it
15 reasonable to deem in the SSI program, a program for poor
16 people, so that the wealthy spouse that my brother talked
17 about would in fact get SSI.

That what the Secretary did is

18 make a reasonable balance between the needs of the link, the
19 permissiveness of

20

(d) but not the mandatory nature of Cd).

And in that conjunction I want to point out again

21 that it is not the Secretary who set up those deeming rules
22 in SSI.

It is Congress.

We are not talking about a

23 question of a Secretary so-called misinterpreting the SSI
24 deeming rules, and I refer again to Section

1382(aa)(2)(a) ,

25 which is the definition of unearned income in determining
35

1 eligibility for an SSI recipient, enacted by Congress, which
2 indicates that you cannot consider support and maintenance
3 unless provided in cash or in kind.
4

Finally, I would like to reiterate the distinct

5 difference, I think, between the arguments that were being
6 made in Gray Panthers and the arguments that were being made
7 here with regard to state relative responsibility laws.
8 What this Court was addressing in Gray Panthers when it
9 noted the inadequacy of the relative responsibility law was
10 the argument that the Gray Panthers had made that the
11 relative responsibility laws are the only mechanism, and
12 when the Court made a notation to the transcript of the oral
13 argument that counsel had acknowledged the difficulty of
14 getting relief to the relative responsibility, counsel was
15 talking about those close cases where it would be just as
16 difficult, in fact, very difficult to expect a state to
17 order it.
18
19

In the situation of a wealthy spouse, it is not
very difficult to enforce the relative responsibility laws,

20 and the relative responsibility laws we are talking about
21 here are in addition to, not the only remedy, and that is, a
22 state can still do deeming under Medicaid for the one-month
23 and six-month period, and in addition has its relative
24 responsibility laws for remedy.
25

So that there is, it seems to me, a distinct
36

difference between the problem that this Court was referring

2

to in its notation in Gray Panthers.

3

I have nothing further unless there are any other

4 questions. Your Honor.
