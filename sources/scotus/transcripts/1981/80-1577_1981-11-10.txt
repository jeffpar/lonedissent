ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELLAND ARCHER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8

MR. ARCHER;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

9 the Court:

The primary question in this case is whether or not

10

11 the playing of coin-operated machines is a fundamental
12 right.

There are other questions, of course.

The second

13 important question is which rules of law are applicable to
14 adults and which are applicable to children.
With your permission, I'd like to discuss the

15
16

fundamental right question first.

We think in finding a

17

fundamental right on a par with freedom of speech and

18

religion, right to travel and other important rights that

19

the Court of Appeals used an extremely broad interpretation

20 of the term "association."
21

Of course, in its broadest terms "association"

22 would encompass all commercial transactions.
23 that.

We realize

If you rent an automobile, of course, there may be

24 some associational aspects.

If you rent a boat, if you rent

25a motel room, you may have guests in.

QUESTION:

1
2 prices,

Well, if you associate together to fix

I suppose that's freedom of association.

3

MR.

ARCHER:

Yes,

yes.

What we're saying is that

4 you can't just take the term "association" in its ordinary
5 sense and apply it as the association that is protected by
6 the

Constitution.

We feel that there is something more than

7 just mere physical proximity to constitute association
8 protected by the Constitution.

9

For instance, if you go in a bank to make a loan

10 you're going to talk with people,
11 friends and

acquaintances.

12 when you're at work,

13 workers.

you're going to meet

When you go in the supermarket,

you have association with your fellow

But these are all matters governed by the law of

14 contract.
15

I'd like to discuss for just a moment the nature of

16 the transaction that is regulated.
17 simple rental agreement.

What we have here is a

Generally a customer pays 25 cents

18 for use of a machine, generally from one to three minutes or
19 whatever time it takes.
20 mower or renting a
21

No different from renting a lawn

power saw or any other machine.

Now, if this type of transaction is the association

22 that is protected by the Constitution under

the decisions of

23 this Court, then every commercial transaction known to man
24 becomes a First Amendment activity.

This we feel will

25 weaken the values that have traditionally been upheld by
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 this Court
2

Going to the question of which rules of law are

3 applicable to adults and which are applicable to children,
4 we say children are simply not the same as adults.

We don't

5 mean to imply that children have no constitutional rights.
6 Certainly they do.

But the rights of children are not

7 always the same as the rights of adults.
8

I think in the words of Justice Frankfurter's

9 concurring opinion in May versus Anderson, he said it much
10 better than I cans

"Children have a very special place in

11 life which law should reflect.

Legal theories and their

12 phrasing in other cases readily lead to fallacious reasoning
13 if uncritically transferred to a determination of a state’s

14 duty towards children."
15

As we read the opinion of the Court of Appeals, we

16 feel that the Court of Appeals has relied upon cases that
17 are good cases, but they are cases dealing with something
18 other than children.

They deal with race, they deal with

19 adults, they deal in suspect areas, they deal with the right
20 to decide whether or not to bear a child.

21 deal with the facts at hand.

But they don't

Therefore we feel that these

22 cases are inapplicable.
23

QUESTION:

Mr. Archer, is it the City's position

24 that playing these games is per se harmful to children?
25

MR. ARCHER:

No, I don't think that's our

that we can't reach the age

21 would you say the state courts have a

rule that they will

22 always interpret their constitutional provisions identically

24

MR.

25

QUESTION;

Is there such a rule?

ARCHER;

Texas has such a rule.
So that they're just forbidden

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 independently to construe their own constitution?
2

MR. ARCHER:

Oh, I don’t think they’re forbidden

3 to, but I think since they are similar and since they were
4 Patterned after the federal Constitution --

5

QUESTION:

Well, I know.

But would you say that it

6 would be a departure from the regular Texas rule if the
7 Texas court said, well, I know the federal courts are

8 holding — would permit this kind of an ordinance, but we
9 just construe our constitution differently?
10

MR. ARCHER;

I think that would be a substantial

11 departure, because one constitution is patterned after the
12 other and the cases construing one are authorities for the

l3other, and that is the rule of law in Texas.

And I think

14 I've covered that in my brief, but I can go into that

I5further if you'd like.
16

QUESTION:

No .

17

QUESTION:

Well, here in any event the holding that

18 both the federal and state Constitutions were violated was a
19 holding of the Fifth Circuit, wasn't it?
20

MR. ARCHER;

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. ARCHER:

23

QUESTION:

Yes .
Not of any Texas court?
No, that's correct.
Does that make a difference on whether

24 or not t his rests on an adequate state ground?
25

MR. ARCHER;

I don't think so, because again I
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 think the Fifth Circuit was simply stating that the two
2 constitutions were identical and

that, of course, if it

3 violated one it would obviously violate the other.
4

QUESTION;

Well, to the extent that the judgment

5 rests on the holding that it violates the state
6 constitution, what's the case doing here?
7

MR. ARCHER;

Well, again I don't think it's an

8 independent state ground.

I think that they are identical.

9 The state constitution and the federal Constitution mean

10 exactly the same thing.

So you couldn't have a federal

11 question without it also -- I mean, you couldn't have
12 violation of the federal Constitution without it also
13 violating the state constitution.
14

But I don't think that that is the meaning of the

15 jurisdictional statute.
16

QUESTION;

I don't think it's --

Well, you're not suggesting, are you,

17 that if indeed you had a state, Texas state court
18 determination of a state constitutional question solely
19 based on the state constitutional question, that that would
20 raise a federal question because the state constitutional
21 provision was the same as the federal Constitution?
22

MR. ARCHER;

Oh, no.

I think the state court would

23 have to actually rule on a federal question before it could
24 come to this Court, obviously.
25

QUESTION;

Well, how about a federal court?

Would

There’s no state law, strict scrutiny test versus

24

Looking at the application of law to children, as I

25 say , I think the Court of Appeals improperly applied rules

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of

law pertaining to adults or to race and other matters,

of confining it to children.

Obviously, children do

Children do not

They do not choose the school they

5 wish

to attend.

They do not in all cases choose the church

they wish to attend.
And while this may be considered private action, it

7

8 is buttressed at
9 if

every point by state action.

For instance,

a child refuses to reside in the domicile chosen by his

10 parents, he's treated by the state as a runaway.

If he

11 refuses to attend the school that his parents choose, he's
12 treated

as a truant.

If he refuses to do the other things

13 that his parents require him to do, the state makes an
14 exception and allows physical punishment that wouldn't be
15 permissible for an adult.
Of course, many states require a parent’s signature

19 action.

Of course,

Others require a
This is all state

there are countless other things in

20 which the state buttresses the action of the parent in not
21 allowing the same rights to minors as adults.
22

I think the failure of the Court of Appeals to give

23 consideration to these facts is what caused the improper
24 judgment.

25

QUESTION:

Well, this ordinance I gather does make

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the distinction, doesn’t it, between this kind of
2 entertainment center and other centers where teenagers
3 gather?
4

MR. ARCHER*

This ordinance itself does not.

This

5 ordinance simply does not deal with those other questions.
6 But this Court has said many times that we were not required
7 to address all the ills existing in one law or one

8 enactment.

I don't think we single out any particular

9 establishment and say, this establishment cannot do this but
10 all others can.

We just fail to say anything about the

11 others.
12

QUESTION:

Well, the ordinance does make a

13 distinction, though, doesn’t it, between teenagers who play
14 these games and teenagers who are present in the same

15 establishment?
16

MR. ARCHER*

Well, yes.

The ordinance does not

17 address the question of being present, but we don’t deny
18that denying them the right to play the games will
19 discourage their presence.

20

QUESTION*

We've never denied that.

What is the interest, then, that the

21 City is trying to achieve with the ordinance?
22

MR. ARCHER*

Well, I think it's twofold.

23 the first is a financial impact.

I think

I think the city fathers

24 feel that the children are spending money on these games
25that they can ill afford, money that they need --

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION*

It's to prevent the children from

2 spending

their money?

3

MR. ARCHER*

We think, that that is one concern.

4 think another concern,
5 by

I

and the concern that was emphasized

our police department, was some of the things that take

6 place at these establishments,
7 fights,

contacts by runaways.
QUESTION*

8
9 from

such as drug transfers,

But the ordinance doesn’t prevent them

going to the centers, right?

10

MR. ARCHER*

Well, not directly.

But we assume

11 they go there because they want to play the machines.

I

12 don't think they’d go there if they couldn't play the
13 machines, or not in any large number.
14
15 statement

QUESTION*

Mr. Archer, I want to be sure about a

I thought you made.

You take the position this

16 ordinance is not directed at Aladdin’s?
17

MR. ARCHER*

Well, no.

It's directed at every

18 establishment in the city.
19

QUESTION*

Isn’t it really directed at Aladdin’s,

20 Period?
21

MR. ARCHER*

No.

We had this ordinance in

22 before we had ever heard of Aladdin’s.

1973,

Now, if they're

23 talking about the amendment, the amendment probably affected
24 Aladdin’s and one other place in the city, Funfare, I
25 believe, in another shopping center.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

I'm speaking of 1353, enacted just two

2 days after a significant event.
3

MR. ARCHER:

Yes, that ordinance -- there had been

4 a previous ordinance that made an exception to places
5 located in a shopping center.

Now, to the extent that it

6 closed that loophole, if you may, then I guess it would be
7 directed to all establishments in shopping center malls,
8 which Aladdin's and I believe one other at that time were
9 the only ones there.

Now there are several.

At that time

10 Aladdin's and one other were the only ones.
11

Now, the age regulation that we're seeking to

12 uphold applies to every establishment in town, the Seven
13 Eleven stores that maybe only have one machine and where
14 there are no other customers present, where there's no
15 association involved whatsoever.
16

QUESTION:

Then you can't justify that on the fact

17that you don't want the children to go to these places where
18 there are drug transactions.
19

MR. ARCHER:

20 I say one.

Well, I think that — well, of course,

You know, I don't know that there's cases where

21 there's never more than one present.
22

QUESTION:

But your point is, the ordinance applies

23 to the Seven Eleven stores, the hotel lobby, and everyplace
24 there's one of these?
25

MR. ARCHER:

Yes.

And that would be based more on
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the financial impact.

But I think most of the

2 establishments have more than one machine, to be candid with
3 you.
4

But what I'm saying is that there doesn't have to

5 be any association involved because it could just be one
6 machine and it could just be one person present.
7 don't know

8

And I

how you'd read association into that.

Frankly,

I don’t know how you read association into

9a hundred people being present unless they go there for a
10 common

purpose, they're acquainted with each other or they

11 become acquainted

12
13 the

after they get there or something.

QUESTION;

Well, I wasn't really as concerned with

association point as the reason for the ordinance.

14 reason

The

for the ordinance has to be, I think, limited to the

15 fact that you don't

want the under

17-year-olds to spend 25

16 cents without the consent of their parents.
MR. ARCHER;

17
18 that

the Appellee uses, spending 25 cents.

19 nothing

20

But there's

in the record -QUESTION;

21 spend
22

Well, unfortunately that's the term

Well, over and over again, maybe they'll

25 cents.
MR. ARCHER;

Right.

In other words, just like if

23 you

smoke one cigarette you may smoke another cigarette.

24 you

take one drink you may take a lot of drinks.

25

QUESTION;

Well, why doesn't that rationale apply

2

MR. ARCHER;

Well, I don't know that we have

3

negated regulation of miniature golf courses.

4

particular ordinance does not.

This

But I don't think that we

5 have said we do not have the power to regulate miniature
6

7

golf courses.
I can see distinctions, and again the record is not

8 as strong in this case.

We thought we were trying it on the

9 rational basis question rather than the higher level test.
10 But officers can drive by and see people playing on the
11 miniature golf course.
12 all times.

They're exposed to public view at

I don't know how much difference that makes, but

13 our police department says it makes a difference.
14

Now, that’s not in the record and I don't know if I

15 should even be saying it.
16

But those are some of the things

that could have been in the record had we known that we

17 would be held to this type of test.
18

QUESTION;

Well, I can understand that if you're

igtalking about an amusement center.

But the ordinance isn't

20 limited to amusement centers.

That's why I made the analogy

21 to the miniature golf course.

It seems to me it’s amusement

22 machines, wherever located -- Seven Eleven, hotel lobbies,
23 pizza joint, whatever it might be.
24

MR. ARCHER;

Yes, I think where it applies to just

25 one machine it is primarily the financial impact.

But I

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 think

you'll find in most cases it'll be more than one

2 machine.

I don’t think any of the places just have — well,

3 there may be a

few.

But I think most of them have from two

4 to four,

you know, that are not arcades.

QUESTION;

is identical to the federal Constitution, I

19 guess I'd have

to say yes.

21 that it was the same as the federal Constitution.

Suppose over a period of time, counsel,

and there were only three city parks in the city.

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Could the council pass an ordinance saying that

17-year-olds

2 could not be in the city parks?

MR. ARCHER;

3

I think we would be a lot closer then

4 to what they're saying here.

For one thing, when they go

5 into the park it's not a financial transaction, it's not a

Eut then have we not, on granting

8 certiorari, on treating it as a cert, denied on the grounds
9 that it was supported by an adequate state grounds?
10

MR. TONE*

Adequacy in that sense, Your Honor,

11 simply means that it is sufficient to support the judgment
12 if correct.

It doesn’t mean that you have reviewed the

13merits of the state ground.

The point I make is

14 illustrated, if the Court please, by the Hastings case, in
15which Chief Justice Hughes addressed this very point in the
16

context of a statute allowing appeal by the Government from

17 an order dismissing an indictment where the indictment -18 where the order held the indictment invalid either on the
19 ground of the invalidity of the underlying statute or the
20 const ruction of the statute on which the indictment was
21 based .
22

And the Chief Justice said in that case that in

23 order to -- that the Court should first examine whether
24 there was an independent ground for the order of the
25 district court.

If there was an independent ground that
2U

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 didn't relate to either the validity of the statute or the
2 construction of the statute, he said the Court would be
3 rendering an advisory opinion by ruling on the questions
4 that were appealable.
5

And he said that review of a judgment we cannot

6 disturb because it rests on grounds we cannot examine would
7 be an anomaly.

And then he used as an analogy the appeal

8 statute which provides for appeal from the highest court of
9a state.

And he said the practice of this Court with

10 respect to such appeals when there is an independent state
11 ground on which the judgment -- which adequately supports
12 the judgment, is to dismiss the appeal.

13

QUESTION;

Do you think Cox Broadcasting has

14 changed that analysis at all?
15

MR. TONE;

I do not think it has, Your Honor.

I

16believe, as I said, Stern and Dressman's position is
17 consistent with mine, and I think that's a correct reading.
18 It seems to me the analysis has to be that it has to be that
19 way.
20

We are, as the Appellee -- we're entitled to rely

21 on whatever state grounds are available to support the
22 Judgment.

We're entitled to rely on state grounds even

23 though the Court of Appeals didn't rule on them.

And yet

24 when it comes up here under 1254(2) we would be precluded
25 from relying upon state grounds that support the judgment

KR. TONE;

Yes, just deny cert.

And if we disagree and grant it, then we

KR. TONE:

MR. TONE:

25

I would question, however, whether that disposition

QUESTION;

Kr. Tone, is there some evidence — in
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

But here is there any evidence that Texas

5 its own?
6

MR. TONE»

No, there is no indication that Texas

7 feels bound to follow the federal.

TONE; That's correct .

17

They’ve already said what the state law

18 is*

19

MR.

TONE; That is correct.

20

QUESTION;

There's nothing to suggest that they'd

21 change their minds because we decided the federal question
22 one way or another.
23

MR. TONE;

That's exactly correct.

They've already

24 decided the state law question.
25

QUESTION;

If they're wrong about the federal law
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and if they think the state and federal rules are the same,
2 as your opponent argues -- now maybe he's wrong -- then if
3 we corrected their analysis of federal law, conceivably they
4 could say, well, that means that the state law result will
5 be different.
6

MR. TONE:

They could, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION:

This is all hypothetical.

But it's at

8 least conceivable.
9

MR. TONE:

But there is nothing in

the opinion of

10 the Court of Appeals, I submit, to suggest that they felt
11 that state law and federal law were identical on these

12 issues.
13

QUESTION:

Or different.

Really, all they do is

14 have a phrase in there saying it violates both provisions.

15

MR. TONE:

That's correct.

16

We, however, have cited some state

law cases in our

17 brief which indicate that the Texas courts, although they
18 phrase the standards approximately
19 does and cite this Court's cases,

the same as this Court
nevertheless reach results

20 which I think this Court would not reach on the same facts.

21 So I think that the Texas law, although it was not analyzed
22 by the Court of Appeals, is not identical with the federal
23 law, and the Court of Appeals did rule on that grounds.
24

There are also, I might add, two other grounds of

25 Texas law, one a Texas common law ground which the Appellee

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 has so far not been able to get a ruling upon.

The Court of

2 Appeals deemed it unnecessary to reach these two other state
3 law grounds which we argue in our brief.

And if this Court

4 were to take the case we would at some point be entitled to
5 an adjudication on those grounds which defend the judgment.
6 And ordinarily we would be able to argue those grounds to
7 this Court because they are grounds for affirmance.

This

19

MR. TONE;

I was speaking to the supposition

20 suggested in the colloquy with Mr. Justice White and Mr.
21 Justice Brennan and

the Mr. Chief Justice that if the Court

22 agrees with our position that the appeal should be dismissed
23 for the reasons stated earlier and treats the jurisdictional

25 it was on that basis that I said

for in the first point in the brief.

8

QUESTION:

Just to be sure I understand one point,

9 you’re also arguing that unless we treat it as a cert and if
10 we just act on a noting of probable jurisdiction under
11 1254(2),

you would agree then we don't have the power to

12 listen to any state law argument?
13

MR.

TONE:

Then you do not have the power to listen

the state law arguments.

But then I submit you don't

would be an advisory one.

4 expression and communication.
5

One of the amicus briefs quotes at length from

6 Marshall KcLuhan.

We have a small quote from his statement

7 about games being communication.

And he says, speaking of

8 all games generally, that they are a media of communication
9 and

that that should now be plain.

And as media of

10 communication, we submit that they fall within the

11 protection of the First Amendment.
12

Like the composer of a musical composition or

13 dance, the author of the game has a protected right to
14 present his creation to people who want to receive it, and
15 they have a right to receive the expression .
16

QUESTION*

How about the Red Lion case, where

17 certainly people are communicating, but a Government agency
18 is telling them that they have to present the other side
19 too?
20

MR. TONE;

That much is true.

But there is a

21 special governmental interest in regulation of speech over
22 the restricted channels available for radio and television.

6 power whatsoever to regulate it.

It merely means that it

7 must regulate it only based upon a compelling state

10 unnecessarily intrusive on the fundamental right.
11

QUESTION;

Do you think that rule applies, that

12 every time, place and manner restriction has to satisfy that
13 test?

14

MR. TONE;

I guess that would be too broad a

15 statement, Your Honor.

I don't think it would.

But this is

16 more than a time, place and manner statement -- or
17 restriction before you at the present time.

As to youths

18 who are unable to persuade their parents to accompany them

19 or who cannot — whose parents both work, it's a flat
20 prohibition.

They can't play the games at all.

21

QUESTION;

Can one gamble on these games?

22

MR. TONE;

No, Your Honor.

Gambling is expressly

23 forbidden, and these are not gambling devices under Texas
24 law.

There is no -- you do not have the old free games or

25 anything, and so on.

They are not gambling devices.

And one could gamble on the games only in the sense

2 that he could gamble on any competitive endeavor.

QUESTION:

You could bet on the outcome?

HR. TONE:

You could bet on the outcome# just as

5 you could bet on the outcome of a football game or on who

Some of these games are played by

7 individuals alone# some are played by more than one or a
8 group of individuals.

So it is possible to gamble with the

9 games# but that is not their purpose and there is no
10 evidence in the record that these games have been used for

11 gambling, and they are not gambling devices under Texas law,
12 which does prohibit gambling devices.

And that is a matter of value

It's easy to deprecate or jocularly put down the

18 social utility of various forms of expression, including

igsome form this Court has held protected.

But the Court has also held that the level of

21 protection to be given any form of expression does not turn
22 on its importance or its social utility.

It's much more expensive.

The ones that are sold

3 at home I think are sold on the order of a few hundred -4 the cost is a few hundred dollars, while these games —
5

QUESTION;

These machines are several thousand.

6

MR. TONE;

That's correct, that is correct.

7

We also have argued in our brief that the right of

8 association is implicated, and the court — the case came
9 here on the question stated in the jurisdictional statement
10 of whether there exists a right of social association.

That

11 was the principal issue stated.

12

I submit that there is.

This Court has -- although

13 it hasn't ruled on that point expressly, I submit that there
14 ought to be such a right, just as there is -- just as
15 entertainment enjoys First Amendment protection as

16 expression.
17

And in the case at bar, at least the stated purpose

18

of the ordinance is to prohibit young people from

19

congrega ting.

The preamble says in fact that congregation

20 of youthful patrons creates problems of policing due to the
21 need to protect the patrons from the influence of those who
22 promote gambling, sales of narcotics, and other unlawful
23 activities.

So the purpose of this, although as Justice

24 Stevens points out it's directed to individual games as well
25 as places where there are more than one game, the purpose,

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the stated purpose, is to prevent congregating, which is an
2 exercise of the right of association.
3

The method chosen is to prevent them from playing

4 the games when they get there.

So it's perhaps an

5 ineffectual method of preventing them congregating, but that
6 is its purpose.
7

I should also like to say in the few minutes left

8 available that constitutional guarantees apply to minors as
9 well as adults.

The scope of the particular right may be

10 reduced in the case of a minor by one or more of the factors
11 identified by Justice Powell in Bellotti II.

These factors

12 are taken into account in defining the state interest to
13

14

justify the regulation limiting a fundamental right.
But nevertheless, even though minors are involved,

15 the fundamental right should enjoy the strict scrutiny -16

the protection of the strict scrutiny test, having in mind

17that the state may have a stronger interest or a different
18interest in regulating the conduct of children than adults.
19

But nevertheless, the strict scrutiny test should

20aPPly and the restriction should bear some -- should serve

21 some substantial purpose in regulating the evil to which
22it's directed, and it should be reasonably limited -- the
23 means should be limited to that which is necessary to
24 protect the interest.
25

QUESTION!

How about truancy laws, Mr. Tone, where
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 a group of youths say, we want to congregate at this
2 particular pool hall during school hours rather than go to
3 school?
4

MR. TONEi

I would say. Your Honor, that the

5 state's compelling interest in requiring children to attend
6 school is sufficient to justify the truancy law and
7 prohibiting children from congregating elsewhere during
8 school hours.

But that doesn't mean that their congregating

9 is not a fundamental right.

Tt just means that that

10 fundamental right has to be balanced against the compelling
11 interest of the state, and in that instance I believe the

12 state -- the compelling interest prevails.
13

As we point out in our brief, if the Court agrees

14 that the games involve expression and a fundamental right,
15 then there is, in addition to the fundamental right
16 analysis, strict scrutiny analysis that I have already
17 stated, a similar analysis under the equal protection

18 cla use.
I think I shall leave to my brief the vagueness

19

20 issue.
21
22 that.

QUESTION;

Let me just ask you something about

If you think the issue is moot, which I take it you

23 do — do you?

2

HR. TONE;

Well, we say that there is a reasonable

of recurrence, and we argue that there is some
of that from the fact that the city has never

fit to tell any court that it repealed the old

6 ordinance and replaced

it with another one.

And the city

7 says it would like to go back to it.
8

Now, that's the —

9

QUESTION;

Do you know of any other instances

10 where, in a situation like that,

we’ve recognized this

11 exception to the mootness doctrine, capable of repetition,
12 yet evading

13

review; is that it?

MR. TONE;

That's it -- no, not -- I'm sorry.

The

14 tests are, under the Los Angeles County case, whether there
15 is any reasonable expectation of recurrence of the violation
16or whether events during the pendency of the litigation have
17Completely eradicated the effects of the violation.

That's

18the test of mootness.
19

QUESTION;

Let me ask you, suppose that, however,

20 we disagree with you and say that it's moot.

Shouldn't we

21 then to that extent vacate the opinions below and dismiss
22 the case to that extent?
23

MR. TONE;

We argue that you should not, Your

24Honor, and the reason is explained in the very last section
25 of our brief.

That would be the more usual disposition.
