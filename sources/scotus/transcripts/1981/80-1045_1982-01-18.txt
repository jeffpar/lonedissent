CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

2

We will hear arguments next

4 Longshoremen.
Mr. Gies.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS P. GIES, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. GIES;

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9 the Court;
10

This case concerns the propriety of an injunction

11

issued by the District Court pursuant to Section 301 of the

12 Labor Management Relations Act,

to restrain a work stoppage

13 in violation of the parties' collective bargaining agreement.
14

The reason for this work stoppage -- the union's

15 disapproval of Occidental's continuing trade with the Soviet
16 Union after the invasion of Afghanistan -- is the decisive
17 fact in this case.

As I will develop this afternoon, it is

18 the motivation for this work stoppage that makes this
19 injunction fully warranted under Section 301, contrary to
20 the decision of the Court of Appeals.
21

We submit very simply to this Court that

22 Norris-LaGuardia

does not apply in this case.

The admitted

23 objective of the union's work stoppage has concededly and
24 always been a purely political motivation.

The concern over

25 the invasion of Afghanistan is not even remotely related to
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the union's status as employees.

Accordingly, that work

2

stoppage is totally unrelated to the purposes of the

3 Norris-LaGuardia Act.
The Court obviously has never held that

4

5 Norris-LaGuardia protects purely political union work
6 stoppages,

and the cases construing Norris-LaGuardia, we

7 submit, are clear.
8

QUESTION;

What's the language of

9 Norris-LaGuardia, labor disputes?
10

MR. GIES;

Section 4 of Norris-La Guardia, Your

11

Hon or , forbids federal courts to enter inju notions in labor

12

dis put es as defi ned el sewhere in that statu te; and the labor

13 dis put e definiti on is defined broadly to in elude wages and
14 ter ms and condit ions w ith the

PU

rpose of as sisting unions in

15 org ani zing emplo yees, and in e ng aging in co llective
16 bar gaining, and for other mutual aid or pro tection.
17

And I submit that even under the broadest possible

18 r ea din g of the m utual aid and pr otection cl ause that it is
19 cle ar that any effort by a uni on in order t o be protected by
20 Nor ris -LaGuardia must make
21

som e effort at i mproving the lot

of the employees as em ployees ; a nd that an objective that is

22 pur el y political has a bsolutel y

no bearing under the

23 Nor ris -LaGuardia Act.
24

QUESTION;

I suppose i t could rea sonably be said

25 tha t this would be aga inst the i nterests of the employees
4

1

because it would cut down their work.
KR. GIFS:

2

Indeed, Your Honor.

Not only against

3 the interests of the employees, but the record is clear in
4 this case that this is against the interests of the United
5 States foreign policy.
6 the protections of

And that provides another reason why

Norris-LaGuardia should not be extended

7 to a case of this kind.
In short, it is clear under Section 301 that

8

9 unless this conduct is protected by Norris-LaGuardia, there
10 is
11

no serious obstacle to the injunction entered by the

District Court.

12 Court

It is only if the union can convince this

to take what we submit to be a radical step in

13 extending the scope of Norris-LaGuardia that there is any
14 case here at all.

If Norris-LaGuardia does not apply, the

15 ordinary equitable principles warranting an injunction

were

16 present in this case, and the injunction properly issued.
17

It is not sufficient, we submit, that there be an

18 incidental work stoppage.

The objective of the union is the

19 determinative factor for answering the question of whether
20 or not Norris-LaGuardia applies.
21

There are strong policy reasons for not extending

22 Norris-LaGuardia to cover a

case like this.

This Court has

23 recognized in the Eastex case and elsewhere that there are
24 definite limits to protected activity that unions are
25 entitled to engage in.
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The Eastex case, of course, grew out of the

1

2 National Labor Relations Act,

which significantly, that

3 contains the same definition of labor dispute as does
4 Norris-LaGuardia.
Under this Court's decision in Eastex, recognizing

5

6 that purely

political conduct is not protected by Section 7,

7 we think that it is equally clear that the conduct would not
8 be protected by the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

9

A second aspect of policy that we think is very

10 critical

11

here is the national labor policy favoring

industrial peace.

12 least one of

The major objective of Section 301, at

those objectives, was to permit enforcement of

13 collective bargaining agreements containing no strike
14 pledges.

Irrespective of the motivation for the work

15 stoppage, we submit national labor policy favors industrial
16 peace and favors enforcement of no strike provisions in
17 collective bargaining agreements.
I've already referred briefly to the foreign

18

19 policy interference at issue in this case.
20 has demonstrated a
21

long history of taking what the First

Circuit in the Allied case called whimsical political

22 activity.

It is very likely to happen again, and the

23 Solicitor General has agreed with our position that the
24 Union's conduct here does indeed interfere with the conduct
25 of American foreign policy.
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

Because of that and because of the other two

policy reasons already articulated, it is clear -QUESTION;

22 advice?

reach Buffalo Forge and that it would have no impact on

1

and holds that this is not a labor dispute.
QUESTION»

2
3

Do you rely on any one particular case

from this Court as holding this is not a labor dispute?
MR. GIES»

4

The question has never come up

5

directly, Your Honor, as far as I know.

I rely very heavily

6

on every case that the Court has decided under

7

Norris-LaGuardia, none of which extend the protections of

8

the Act to purely political conduct.
And I submit, Your Honor, to reach the exception

9
10

of Norris-LaGuardia unless the Act applies in the first

11

instance.

12

13
14

And that is our position.
QUESTION»

But if you lose that first point, then

what about Justice Rehnquist's question?
MR. GIES:

If we lose the first point, Your Honor,

15

then obviously the Court must face again the difficult

16

question of when does a labor injunction issue, assuming the

17

applicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.

18

again that Buffalo Forge is easily distinguishable from this

19

case, and that even if the Court were to extend

20

Norris-LaGuardia to include this kind of dispute, that there

21

is sound reason why injunctive relief was proper under Boys

22

Markets in this case.

We submit here

23

QUESTION»

What are the distinguishing features?

24

MR. GIES:

There are two principal distinctions,

25

Your Honor, that I would make between this case and Buffalo
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Forge.

The first and most important is that this conduct is

2 not statutorily protected.

It is purely political conduct

3 and not protected by Section 7 of the National Labor
4 Relations Act.
Buffalo Forge, on the other hand, involved the

5

6 right of employees to refuse to cross a picket line

-- one

7 of the most fundamental of union rights, very clearly
8

protected activity.

And the Court there necessarily had to

9 grapple with the competing tensions of statutorily protected
10 conduct

11

on one hand, and the statutorily protected right of

the employer to enforce this no strike clause.

12

QUESTIONt

You mean, this is on the assumption

13 that Norris-LaGuardia applies.
14

MR. GIES;

Correct.

15

QUESTION;

And then you would say an injunction

16 could issue whenever you find that something falls outside
17 of Section 7, even if there's a labor dispute.
18

MR. GIES;

Correct, Your Honor, because the

19 objective and the motivation of the union's conduct is still
20 relevant,

even if Norris-LaGuardia would apply --

21

QUESTION;

Well,

this point has nothing to do with

22 Buffalo Forge either.

23

MR. GIES;

It distinguishes this case from Buffalo

24 Forge in our view. Your Honor.
25

QUESTION;

Go ahead.

MR. GIESi

1

Now, the second reason that this case

2

is very different from Buffalo Forge is the nature of the

3

work stoppage and what motivated it in the first place.

4

Buffalo Forge -QUESTION:

5

May I go back for a moment, because I

want to be sure I understand your first distinction.

You

8

MR. GIES:

The conduct of the striking employees.

9

QUESTION:

Because this is a right to strike --

10

because their motive was political.

I see.

11

MR. GIESi

Correct, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Whereas in Buffalo Forge the sympathy

13

strike was statutorily protected.
MR. GIESi

it was waived.

18

MR. GIESi

Correct, Your Honor.

Correct.

And so

protected, was it then waived by the no strike clause in the

21

contract.

protected in the first instance.

nature of the work stoppage.

QUESTION:

22

MR. GIES :

Indeed, we do.

That there really is an underlying

namely the breadth of the management

the Court were to find this to be protected by

that the Solicitor General and our

Has your client yet gone to arbitration?

MR. GIES:

We have not, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION:

Is there a reason for that?

20

MR. GIES:

Several reasons, Your Honor, the first

21

of which is that we think it's just as incumbent upon the

22 union to proceed to arbitration in a case like this as it is
23 for

us.

And I submit that the reason why there's been no

25 that issue

in this case is because the union already lost
in New Orleans and didn't want to lose it again

Moreover, as a matter of fact, soon after this

2

3 injunction was issued,

the presidential embargo was extended

4 to cover the product at

issue in this case; and practically

5 speaking, at that point there wasn't any immediate need to

nature of the Allied case -- and there are different

theories there as to what the secondary boycott was or was

4 Markets a pre-arbitration injunction was fully warranted
5 under Boys Markets.
6

But even if the Court finds, in response to

7 Justice Stevens' question, that the only contractual issue
8 here is the no strike clause, then I submit that there are
9 differences, again based on the motivation of the union's
10 conduct, that would not require overruling Buffalo Forge but
11 would permit the injunction in this case.

And that reason

12 again gets back to the motivation of the union's conduct.
13

The motivation here is purely political.

There is

14 no competing tension between two aspects of national labor
15 policy.

Moreover, to the extent that intervening case law

16 and interpretation of Buffalo Forge has caused the confusion
17 that it has, we submit that that provides an additional
18 reason for not extending Buffalo Forge to the facts of this
19 case.
20

There's no real question in our mind that the

21 availability of other remedies to combat a work stoppage of
22 this kind has been curtailed.

The availability of the

23 damages remedy has been cut back by this Court's decision in
24 both Carbon Fuel and Complete Auto Transit.

MR. MATHEWS;

I would say that if it is not

15 arbitrable under the contract it simply — well, I mean
16 look, that refusal to handle would be in the nature of a

17 sympathy strike in Buffalo Forge, wouldn’t it?
18 that's really what they were doing.

I mean

There they wouldn't

19 cross a picket line; here they won't handle the goods.

But

20 both is out of sympathy for the employees in the other
21 thing.

And yes, I think that Buffalo Forge would apply, and

22 that there could be no pre-arbitration injunctive relief.

You're taking a good deal of the quid

MR. MATHEWS;

2

No, I don't, if you keep in mind

that the no strike pledge was given only because we could

3 get relief from the arbitrator.

If we could get management

4

to sit down and arbitrate that,

5

to them hey, look, you can’t deal with those people because

6 of their labor policies.
7

and the arbitrator could say

If there was some chance of

success in the non-economic forum, then we would say yes, go

8 ahead, let's arbitrate

it.

But what management is asking

from arbitration; you know, just grin and bear it.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

MR. GIES;

Just briefly, Your Honor.

In response to Justice Marshall’s question about

17 the dogcatcher and the blockbuster issues,
18 ignores the

fact that this union this past year conducted a

19 one-day work stoppage over the death of
20 Army prisoner Bobby Sands.

In response to Justice Powell's question, it is

1

2 very conceivable that domestic political disputes may indeed
3 arise, and that raises the point of who has control over the

situation.

If a union strikes to protest a political

5 contribution made by the employer,
6 could resolve that dispute by

giving the money to some other

the interest of the union.

that is even less a problem than we have
