ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT A. MAYER, ESQ.,

9

ON EEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. MAYER;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
This case is before you on a writ of

10

certiorari to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

11

Petitioner should enjoy absolute judicial immunity from

12

Section 1983 damages liability for acts taken in

13

discharge of his duties as an aide to the court, in

14

order that the court's judicial duties may be properly

15

accom plished.

16

The intimate relationship between the court

17

clerk and the court is clearly reflected in the record

18

in this case.

19

Court of Cook County, created court procedures in order

20

to implement a general order issued by the presiding

21

judge of the Municipal District in the Criminal Court of

22

Cook County.

23

in conjunction with the general order in order to notify

24

the Chicago Police Department of warrant recall orders,

25

as well as to notify victims and witnesses of court

Petitioner, the clerk of the Circuit

The clerk created these court procedures

1

dates when a criminal defendant, such as Respondent,

2

fails to appear in court on the designated court date.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Mayer, is it your position

4

basically that the clerk should enjoy absolute immunity

5

here, even if, for example, he refused to forward any

6

recall orders involving blacks?
MR. MAYER:

7

The clerk would enjoy absolute

8

judicial immunity only if he was acting in his capacity

9

as clerk in order that judicial duties may be properly

10

accomplished.
QUESTION:

11

As a clerk, he declines to forward

12

any recall orders involving blacks.

13

in your view?
MR. MAYER:

14

Absolutely immune

He would not be absolutely immune

15

in that situation.

He would be immune only if he was

16

acting pursuant to court order or directive, within the

17

scope of his duties as the clerk of the court.

18

QUESTION:

Well, how is that different?

19

MR. MAYER:

In this case, there is no

20

allegation of a clerk intentionally failing to

21

communicate to the police department an arrest recall

22

warrant.

23

the Petitioner as the clerk of the court in his official

24

capacity in creating procedures.

25

there are no allegations that they are unconstitutional,

In this case the only allegations are against

These procedures,

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

but merely that those procedures were not followed by

2

one clerk, who, by mistake or inadvertence, inadvertently

3

failed to communicate the warrant recall to the Chicago

4

Police Department.

5

QUESTION;

Well, does the mandatory nature of

6

the duty, then, affect whether in your view there is

7

absolute immunity?

8

9

KR. MAYER;

No, it is not relevant whether or

not the duty is labeled discretionary or ministerial.

10

The relevant inquiry is not into that nature, but into

11

whether or not that is a function intimately associated

12

to the court process.

13

not on whether or not the clerk must or must not —

14

whether it's a ministerial or discretionary duty, but on

15

the function.

16

Therefore, the question devolves

The test is whether the clerk is acting as an

17

official aide and whether he is functioning in that

18

capacity as clerk, as the Petitioner in this case was in

19

fact doing.

20

judge, he created procedures.

21

against any other clerk in this case.

22

In his close association with the presiding

QUESTION;

There are no allegations

But Mr. Mayer, is it not true that

23

the complaint alleges that those procedures were

24

knowingly adopted even though they were unconstitutional

25

procedures?

Page 9 of the Joint Appendix has that kind

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

of allegation
MR. MAYER:

The complaint on its face alleges

3

that the Petitioner knowingly implemented court

4

procedures, but there are no allegations on the face of

5

the complaint other than —

6

QUESTION;

Well, here’s the paragraph I have

7

reference to:

"The conduct, procedures and customs

8

herein alleged occurred and continued to occur during

9

the course of and as a result of Defendant’s knowing and

10

unconstitutional adoption, promulgation, revocation, and

11

implementation of policies, statements, regulations, and

12

known custom."

13

MR. MAYER;

14

is in the complaint.

15

QUESTION:

It’s correct that that allegation

And you’re saying that your client

16

is immune even though he did exactly what’s alleged

17

there, absolutely immune?

18

MR. MAYER:

Even assuming, taking all facts

19

20

QUESTION;

That is your position?

21

MR. MAYER;

Yes, that is true, our position is

22

that he is absolutely immune as a function of his status

23

as clerk, acting as clerk for the court.

24

no different than if the Respondent alleged that the

25

judge in his creation of procedures in his general order

This would be

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

knowingly created procedures similar to the allegations

2

in the complaint.

3

He is, like the judge, performing a function

4

as clerk for the court, in a quasi-judicial capacity,

5

within the scope of his authority, which is admitted in

6

the face of the complaint.

7

this was his duty as the court clerk, that he created

8

these procedures, and that all that he failed to do was

9

to create perfect procedures.

The complaint admits that

When we discuss the question of judicial

10
11

immunity, we are dealing with an imperfect world.

12

is all that happened here.

13

file in the court's office, clerk's office, was at most

14

what carsed the failure of the recall warrant to be

15

communicated.
QUESTIONS

16

That

A mere mistake and a mislaid

Mr. Mayer, do you see any

17

distinction between the clerk's act in carrying out the

18

order of the judge or the court or in refusing to carry

19

it out?

20

MS. MAYES:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

It is irrelevant whether or —
If the clerk just refuses to carry

out the judge's order to transmit recalls?
MS. MAYEHs

Our position is that the clerk

24

would be absolutely immune in that situation, because it

25

is -- the policy considerations behind allowing -- the

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

policy considerations are as follows:

2

clerks, as judges, should be free from allegations of —

3

free from defending against allegations of a 1983

4

complaint for acts that are intimately related to the

5

judicial process, whether or not those acts are carried

6

out.

7

that court

The majority of circuits who have decided

8

whether or not clerks are absolutely immune have held

9

that they are as long as the act is pursuant to a court

10

order or directive or intimately related to the

11

process.

12

held that without regard to scienter, which is a factor

13

that is always taken -- which is never taken into

14

consideration in a question of immunity of judges,

15

dating back to Bradley versus Fisher.

Even the Fifth Circuit in Williams versus Wood

16

It is irrelevant because the policy is that

17

the potential harm to deny absolute judicial immunity

18 from Section 1983 damages is greatly outweighed by the
19 good to the public.
20

QUESTION:

Is this derivative from the judge?

21

MB. MAYER:

Our position is that the absolute

22 judicial immunity enjoyed by the court clerk — he
23 derives his status from the court, but he — the test
24 for his immunity is dependent not only on his status
25

from the court —

follow it, and he continues to follow it.

SR. SAYER:

court.

context of the court.

2

anything else, but you look then to what is his conduct,

3

and if his conduct as a chaufeur has nothing to do with

4

the court system, which I assume it does not, he would

5

enjoy no immunity in his status as a chaufeur.

6

QUESTIONS

He can be called bailiff or

Earlier I thought you responded to

7

one question that indicated that if the clerk had an

8

order from the judge and he failed to carry that order

9

out he would still have immunity.

Now, if it's

10

derivative from the judge, how is it a quasi-immunity

11

act if he's doing not what the judge ordered him to do,

12

but failing to do what the judge ordered him to do?

13

5!R. KAIERs

Our position is that in the sense

14

that a clerk is acting as a judge he would have

15

derivative immunity.

16

as the clerk and not the judge, he enjoys absolute

17

judicial immunity without regard to the manner of

18

performance of the act, because we look not to the

19

specific result of whether or not the act was

20

accomplished; we look to what was the function of the

21

clerk at the time.

22

In the sense that the clerk acts

In this case, the failure of the warrant

23

recall order to be communicated was merely the result of

24

at most inadvertence, and in that case it is no

25

different than in the common law when a court clerk

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

failed — erroneously entered an order by the court.

2

was as if the clerk did not enter the order at all, but

3

under the common law the clerk did in fact enjoy

4

immunity from damage liability.

5

QUESTION;

It

Why wouldn't qualified immunity be

6

adequate here, in terms of exactly what happened?

7

you say all it was was a piece of negligence, why would

8

he need any more than qualified immunity?

9

MR. MAYER;

If

The clerk should enjoy absolute --

10

the absolute judicial immunity, not a qualified

11

immunity, because he would be forced at trial to defend

12

against the good faith acts of conduct that is

13

intimately related to the judicial process.

14

independence of the judiciary — this would require the

15

clerk to go to court, to sit at the defense table, to

16

defend against conduct that may in the end turn out not

17

in fact to have been the result of negligence, or if

18

even intentional conduct.

19

The

The point is that the court system will be

20

clogged, the judicial machinery will break down, if

21

court clerks are required to defend their actions in

22

court in 1983 actions.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. MAYER;

25

Why do clerks ever post bonds?
Court courts post bond in their

fiduciary capacity as a trustee —

12

QUESTION;

3

nothing for bonds?

4

Well, why aren’t they just
Are they just paying money out for

MR. MAYER;

No, they're not.

But the question

5

of bonds is a different question from whether or not the

6

court in a 1983 action should be subject to absolute --

7

QUESTION;

Can you see a clerk on his bond?

8

Can the clerk be sued on his bond for this conduct, for

9

malfeasance in office?

10

MR. MAYER;

A clerk could be sued on his bond,

11

but he could also — there are other alternative

12

remedies that a clerk can be sued on besides his bond.

13
14
15

QUESTION;

Why can he be sued on his bond if

he's absolutely immune?
MR. MAYER;

Because the statute -- well, the

16

state statute can provide, as it does in Chapter 25,

17

Section 10, as an alternative remedy, that the clerk of

18

the court can — the principal clerk is liable for the

19

acts of his subordinates.

20

QUESTION;

Well, in Illinois -- in Illinois is

21

the bond required of a clerk, a bond, an insurance

22

policy like the public liability for driving an

23

automobile, or is it a bond simply to replace any money

24

which he receives and embezzles?

25

MR. MAYER;

Yes, the latter aspect is the

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

purpose of the bond in the State of Illinois, for the

2

purpose of -- to replace those moneys that are taken

3

illegally by the clerk.

4

QUESTION:

Suppose the Illinois legislature

5 passed a statute that says, we know we've read all about
6

this immunity for state officers under 1983, but that

7

just is an assumption by the Supreme Court or by some

8

courts that this kind of immunity is essential to get

9

the public work done.

Well, we hereby declare that it

10

is not essential to get the Illinois public work done to

11

have immunity under 1983.
There certainly wouldn't be any immunity then,

12

13

would there?
MR. MAYER;

14

The clerk would be immune only if

15

he was acting as an official aide of the court in order

16

to discharge the court's duties.
QUESTION;

17

But the state doesn't want any

18

protection for its officers to protect its public

19

business.

20

MR. MAYER:

The state can legislate in this

21

area, as it has done already in the Illinois Revised

22

Statutes in the Clerk's Act.

23
24
25

QUESTION;

Would you think -- could the clerk

have been sued under state law here?
MR. MAYER;

The clerk could have been sued

1

under state law

3

QUESTIONS

And he would not have been immune?

Under state law he would not have been immune?
MR. MAYER;

4

Under state law today there is a

5

statute that would provide that the principal clerk can

6

be sued for the acts of his deputies.
QUESTIONS

7

8

He could be sued for this conduct

right here, and he would not be immune under state law?
MR. MAYERs

9

Under state law, the question has

10

not been decided whether the clerk enjoys judicial

11

immunity.

12

case authority that permits a clerk to be sued in a

13

civil action.
QUESTION;

14
15

18

For the negligence of his

deputies?
MR. MAYER:

16
17

But there is a state statute and there is

yes, for the negligence of his

deputies.
QUESTION:

Aren’t you asking the federal

19

courts, then, to be more Roman than the Romans?

20

Illinois courts, the Illinois legislature, permit this

21

sort of an action in state court against a clerk, I

22

would think Justice White is quite right that Illinois

23

has determined that absolute immunity isn’t necessary.

24

QUESTION;

25

MR. MAYER:

That would be non-action.

You have

Does the immunity for which you argue extend
regardless of whether it’s action or non-action?
MR. MAYER:

Yes, Your Honor, and the reason

19

for that again is that acting as an official aide of the

20

judge in his capacity as the clerk, it is not relevant

21

whether the inteniei -- whether the intended result was

22

accomplished.

23

considerations require that in order for the judicial

24

machinery to be able to function with the essential

25

court officers, the clerks — the courts will be clogged

The fact is that the policy

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

with petitioners like the clerk of the circuit court

2

having to go in to defend against actions of performance

3

or non-performance, it will disrupt the court system to

4

such a degree that the potential harm to deny absolute

5

judicial immunity must be outweighed by the public good

6

to have clerks clerking and not sitting in courtrooms

7

defending against actions and complaints under 1983

8

either for inaction or action.
QUESTION:

9

What if the inaction was

10

deliberate?

The clerk just didn’t want to have the

11

mandate issue because ha didn’t agree with it.
MR. MAYER:

12

Our position would be the same,

13

that an absolute judicial immunity would exist

14

regardless of the intent or the malice or the bad

15

faith.

QUESTION:

Even if he deliberately ignored the

judgment of the court?
MR. MAYER:

19

better to allow one corrupt -- a corrupt clerk to go

25

The facts in this case are simple.

The clerk

QUESTION*

All he

These procedures were

Hr. Mayer, you didn't raise any

5

question as to whether or not the clerk could be held

6

substantively liable under 1983.

7

petition, the only question you raise is, assuming that

8

the clerk can be held liable for these rather detached

9

and passive acts, whether notwithstanding the

As I understand your

10

substantive liability he may assert an absolute

11

immunity.

12

HR. MAYER;

Yes, Your Honor, our petition —

13

the question presented is limited to whether or not he

14

should enjoy absolute judicial immunity for acts taken

15

in discharge of his duties as an official aid of the

16

court, in order that the court's judicial functions can

17

be properly accomplished.

18

And the facts in this case clearly reflect

19

that whan the clerk, the Petitioner, created these

20

procedures he did it with the court's knowledge, with

21

the court's approval, under the court's supervision —

22

clearly an act as the clerk within his scope of

23

authority as the clerk of the court.

24
25

In this case. Petitioner is clearly and should
be clearly held absolutely immune for an act that is so

judicial process.

3

The 1983 cases in the circuits that have dealt

4

with this issue have all held -- the majority of the

5

cases that have held that the clerks are immune have

6

held that the clerk of the court's common law immunity

has not been abrogated by the enactment of Section

8

1 983.

QUESTION;

Well, what if it's abrogated by

state law?

Well, if -- the clerk's immunity

should still survive regardless of whether — in 1983

13

actions, the question is whether —

14

QUESTION;

Why would it?

15

MR. MAYER;

Why would it?

The question of whether or not the

16

clerk is absolutely immune under 1983 is dependent upon

17

whether or not at common law the clerk was -- enjoyed

18

immunity from damages when sued when performing acts as

19

a clerk in discharge of his duties, regardless — and as

20

the common law establishes, the clerk of the court was

21

not amenable to suit when acting under the direction and

22

supervision of the court.

23

A presumption existed that when a clerk acted

24

he acted with the authority of the court for whom he

25

acted, regardless of whether or not it was negligent or

MR. ELS3N:

Stump versus Sparkman?
Yes.

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

SR. ELSON;

1

In Stump versus Sparkman, the

2

court -- one of the requirements for judicial immunity

3

was that the court act within its jurisdiction.

4

seems clear from the context of the case that the Court

5

was referring to jurisdiction in the sense of

6

jurisdiction to decide cases.

It

7

And I think this interpretation was augmented

8

in the Court's recent decision in Dennis versus Sparks,

9

in which the Court held that the purpose of judicial

10

immunity -- that judicial immunity arose in order to

11

protect judges* ability "to exercise their independent

12

judgment about the merits of cases."
The only precedent on this, direct precedent

3
4

on this subject dates back to 1879 in the case of Ex

5

Parte Virginia, in which the Court was explicit in

6

saying that — this Court was explicit in saying that

7

it's necessary to look at the actual function performed

8

by a judge, and that if a judge performs a function that

9

could just as well be handled by anybody — in that case

20

it was a purely ministerial duty — then the judge has

21

no immunity simply because of his title and status.
QUESTION*

22
23
24
25

Of course, that was a mandamus

action.
HR. ELSONi

That was a mandamus action.

This

Court has looked at the policies for mandamus for

immunity in terms of injunctive relief and damages in

2

some cases as being related.

3

indication that the Court would have had a different

4

view in terms of damages, certainly, in that case.

5

would even hazard that the reasons for injunctive relief

6

might be even stronger than for damages.

7

QUESTION;

In that case there was no

I

Is it your position, counsel, that

8

the clerk would be entitled to qualified immunity for

9

failure or refusal to perform a mandatory duty?

10

SR. ELSON;

No, Your Honor.

It's our position

11

that on the facts of this case it's just premature to

12

determine whether any immunity would be appropriate, as

21

If a mandatory --- what is your view of the

appropriate of what would be appropriate?
MR. ELSON;

If the mandatory duty were of a

22

appropriate.

1

Well, the court -- the only

indication was its reference to its previous case in

3

Dieu versus Norton.

4

that a court clerk, had absolute immunity for actually

carrying out the orders of a judge acting pursuant to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

that he was performing purely a ministerial function.

2

QUESTION;

3

MR. ELSONf

Ministerial officer.
And had no discretion whatsoever.

4

And the ministerial — the proposition that there is no

5

immunity for ministerial functions fits within the

6

historical background of Section 1983.

7

requirements for proving absolute immunity under Section

8

1983 is to show -- the Petitioner has the burden of

9

showing that there was an equivalent immunity in 1871,

10

One of the

when Section 1983 was enacted.
QUESTION:

11

Mr. Elson, before you leave the

12

question on remand, is it nt correct that there are

13

three alternatives, rather than two, even under your

14

view of the law?

15

ministerial act there would be no immunity at all.

16

the other extreme, if he’s carrying out a direct order

17

of the judge and if he does exactly what the judge tells

18

him to, I think you probably would agree that’s absolute

19

immunity.

One would be that if it were a mere
And

t

20

MR. ELSON:

No, I would not, because the order

21

in this case of the chief judge was purely an

22

administrative order, and it’s our position --

23

QUESTION:

Well, let me put it a little

24

differently.

Would there not be some situations in

25

which the clerk did nothing more than carry out a direct

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

order of a judge where he would be entitled to absolute

2

immunity?

3

HR. ELSON:

4

QUESTION :

Definitely.
All right.

But is there not an

5

intermediate category where he might have -- he's not

6

carrying out a direct order, he might be performing a

7

discretionary act, such as drafting new procedures or

8

something like that, where you might recognize qualified

9

immunity ?

10

MR. ELSON:

11

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And this conceivably could be such

12

a case, because one of the questions is whether his

13

procedures are reasonable or not.

14

HR. ELSON:

That's correct.

And the recent

15

decisions, though not the historical decisions on this,

16

would indicate that a qualified immunity would be

17

appropriate.

18
19

QUESTION:

So that actually on remand any one

of those three alternatives is at least conceivable?

20

MR. ELSON:

21

QUESTION:

22

If we were to affirm the remand, we

need not now determine what immunity he’s entitled to.

23

MR. ELSON:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's correct.

That's correct, exactly.
Mr. Elson,

I take it from the Court

of Appeals' opinion that the issue of liability, as

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

opposed to immunity# isn’t totally resolved by the Court

2

of Appeals.

3

kind of treats the case like a hunting accident and

4

said# you know, one of these five people must be liable,

5

go back and figure out who.

6
7

But it's not irrefutably foreclosed that the
clerk here might be held not liable, is it?

8
9
10

As I read the author of the opinion, he

MR. ELSONt

Oh, definitely not.

That's not

closed, and the Seventh Circuit I think as very clear on
that.

But of course, that is not the issue presented

11

12

QUESTION;

13

MR. ELSONi

14

Going back to the historical, the equivalent

Right.
-- in this case.

15

immunity — and I would emphasize that, because this

16

Court has made it clear that without any equivalent

17

historical, any equivalent immunity at common law, then

18

the official’s claim to absolute immunity must fail

19

because the literal terms of Section 1983 require an

20

all-inclusive scope of liability which must be give

21

effect without the background of an equivalent

22

immunity.

23

And here the law in the nineteenth century was

24

absolutely clear, and it was best stated in this Court's

25

1870 decision in Amy versus Supervisors, in which the

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Court held, this Court held, that officials had not even

2

a good faith immunity for their negligence in carrying

3 out their duties.

And there's no reason — and the law

4 is very clear that court clerks were not exempted from
5 this rule of official liability.
6

There's no dispute in this case as to what the

7 mandatory duty of the court clerk was.
8

9

And this is

stated in the appendix at page 23, which stated —
QUESTION!

Suppose the clerk had a mandatory

10

duty to send this form along, this warrant recall form

11

along, and there was just some negligence by him or one

12

of his deputies that -- suppose when the facts are --

13 it's just a pure case of negligence.
14

Now, wasn't there a footnote in the Court of

15

Appeals' opinion that that wouldn't — if it were just

16 negligence, it would not amount to a 1983 violation?
17

NR. ELSON;

That's correct, that was the view

18 in the Seventh Circuit prior to this Court's decision in
19 Parrot versus Taylor.
20

QUESTION s

21

MR. ELSONi

22

Yes.
Which indicated that that was no

longer the law in terms of negligence being not

23 sufficient to state a claim under Section 1983.
24

QUESTION:

Suppose all the clerk did was

25 negligently fail to carry out what -- the requirements

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of a quite adequate set of procedures and regulations

2

that he and the judge worked out.

3

perfectly all right.

4

carry it out.

5

On their face they’re

He just negligently failed to

And he's sued in 1983, stating a cause of

6

action, and the facts show that he has been negligent.

7

Now what kind of an immunity would you say he would

8

enjoy in that?

9

MR. ELSONs

I'm not sure whether your

10

hypothetical is talking about the deputy clerk who

11

failed to actually physically get the document to the

12

police or the chief clerk who was responsible for the

13

procedures.

14

QUESTIONS

15

MR. ELSONs

Either one.
Either one.

Well, in either case

16

there would be no — it would be our position that there

17

would be no absolute immunity.
QUESTION:

18

Because he just negligently failed

19 to carry out an order.
MR. ELSONs

20

I believe the question you're

21

asking goes to whether or not there's a constitutional

22

violation, and it could very well be —
QUESTION;

23

No, no, my question doesn’t.

24

thought you went that there was a constitutional

25

violation.

Let's assume there is.

I

Negligent conduct

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

may nevertheless amount to a constitutional violation.

2

Assume there is.

3

Now the question is immunity.

4

MR. ELSON:

Well, it's our position that the

5

nature of the constitutional violation does not affect

6

the determination of whether or not here’s immunity.

7

Those are wholly separate questions, and it's given in

8

any immunity case that there is a sufficiently severe

9

violation to rise to constitutional proportions.
QUESTION;

10

So —

So would you put this in the

11

category that this was a ministerial act that he failed

12

to carry out?

13

MR. ELSON:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ELSON:

Yes, I -So no immunity at all.
It’s unclear.

But the duty was,

16

as is spelled out in the chief judge's order which is

17

quoted on page 23 of the appendix, where it says, three

18

times actually, "The clerk shall deliver the warrant

19 recall order to the central warrant unit."
20

be more explicit in that regard.
QUESTION:

21

22

It couldn't

Well, why then was there a remand?

Did a majority of the Court of Appeals decide that there

23 might be immunity even though it was only a ministerial
24
25

act?
MR. ELSON:

No, I don't believe the Court of

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Appeals reached that level of inquiry into the case.

2

There had simply been no factual development to

3

determine whether there had been any violation at all,

4

and possibly whether in fact the clerk may have acted

5

pursuant, adequately acted pursuant to the commands of

6

the judge.

7

QUESTION;

Counsel, do you think that mere

8

negligence rises to a constitutional violation under

9

1983?

MR. ELSON;

10

Well, I think it can in certain

11

situations, and I believe that this Court has already

12

decided that it can in its Parrot decision.

13

however, I would emphasize that that question is not

14

raised in this case.

15

that negligence is not -- does not rise to a

16

constitutional violation, the issue here is absolute

17

immunity given a constitutional violation.

Again,

Certainly if this Court could find

Even if Petitioner were able to show a common

18
19

law background for absolute immunity, Petitioner could

20

not meet the second burden, independent burden of

21

establishing immunity, and that is that the immunity is

22

essential to the proper performance of a court clerk's

23

duties.

24

absolute immunity is essential to the performance of the

25

court clerk’s duties, while on the other hand this Court

Petitioner has no explanation for why an

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

has held that such immunity is not essential to the

2

performance of the duties of a governor, of school board

3

members, hospital administrators, prison administrators,

4

policemen.

If --

5

QUESTION*

Cabinet officers.

6

MR. ELSONs

That's correct.

7

And if the Petitioner's duties in this case

8

are anything more than ministerial, they are certainly

9

no more than of an executive or administrative nature

10

and therefore deserve no more immunity than

11

administrative or executive officials.

12

argue that it deserves less immunity because normally

13

court clerks perform -- have less discretion in their

14

duties than say governors, cabinet officers, et cetera.

15

Petitioner's primary policy argument is that,

Indeed, I would

16

as we've heard, the clerks serve as an aide to the judge

17

and that they are important to judicial proceedings.

18

Well, this Court has made it clear that official

19

immunity depends not on an official's status or his

20

location in the judicial process, but on whether the

21

judgments of the official are functionally comparable to

22

the judgments of a judge in deciding cases, as this

23

Court pointed out in the Dennis opinion.

24

Since the Petitioner's responsibility for the

25

unconstitutional arrest in this case in failing to have

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

adequate procedures had nothing to do with deciding the

2

merits of a case, this functional comparability

3

argument, grouni, is conclusive that judicial immunity

4

cannot apply.

Petitioner --

14 than there's a statute passed in state A that says there

is no such immunity, we don't need that kind of

16 immunity.

And then there's a 1983 suit brought in the

17 same state against a clerk for very similar -- would he
18 then be immune?
19

HR. ELSON;

Well, I think one could rely on

20 Sectio 1988 of Title 42 to argue that where the federal
21

law is deficient in any respect, that is, it doesn't

22 provide in any way about immunity, then you would look
23 to state law that most effectively serves the purposes
24 of the federal statute.
25

And in that case you would look

at the state law's abrogation of immunity.

I would point out that there is no law in

suggested might fix bond, for example, or determine

19

way.

Could he be liable under your statute in state

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. ELSON:

Thank you. Your Honor.

Mr. Chief

Justice, may it please the Court:
Before we recessed for lunch I was discussing

10

why absolute immunity is not necessary to promote

11

judicial efficiency.

12

Petitioner's own memo to his clerks, to his

13

subordinates, showed recognition that 1983 liability is

14

indeed an incentive to promote efficient judicial

15

procedures.

16

incentive to Petitioner's subordinates there's no reason

17

to think that it wouldn't be an incentive to Petitioner

18

himself to use adequate procedures.

19

And I was pointing out, the

And I would point out that if it's an

There is a third criteria for establishing

20

absolute immunity from damages, and that is that

21

Petitioner must show that there are adequate safeguards

22

built into the process by which the court clerk or any

23

official acts that reduce the need for a damage,

25

immunity justified unless there were adequate, such

This Court has never found absolute

adequate safeguards built into the process by which the

2

official acts.

3

And those safeguards, which were described in

4

Economou versus Butts — the most essential ones are the

5

right to an adversarial hearing, the right to appeal,

6

and recourse to precedent.

7

Petitioner's failure here to have adequate

8

safeguards, being a purely administrative -- to have

9

adequate procedures for handling these recalls, is

10

purely an administrative type of action and occurred

11

wholly outside of the adjudicative process.

12

no possibility of such safeguards being present, and

13

therefore there's no need — there’s no reduction in the

14

need for a Section 1983 damage remedy to restrain

15

constitutional violations.

16

requirement of absolute immunity the Petitioner has the

So there is

And this is an independent

17 burden of showing, the existence of these safeguards.
18

In response to Petitioner's argument, I would

19

point out that essentially I think Petitioner has

20

conceded the question presented of whether he's entitled

21

to absolute immunity in his response to Justice

22

O’Connor's question as to whether there is — as to

23 whether a clerk would be immune if the clerk violated a
24 court order and discriminated against an individual.

In

25 conceding that there would be no immunity in that case,

I think that essentially essentially concedes the

question presented.

3

I think that concession is dicated, in sum, by

4

the three separate requirements for absolute immunity

that this Court has set up in all of its immunity

cases;

policy reasons that make immunity necessary for the

accomplishment of the official’s duties, and that there

QUESTION*

10

In other words, you’re saying that

it must be something paralleling the kind of derivative

immune if the legislator had himself performed it.

3

Derivative immunity of a court clerk, however, would be

arm of the judge.
QUESTION:

It would be related to

If he issued, if the clerk issued,

absolute immunity because he’d be carrying out an

18

There would be a derivative immunity,

And in the same sense I think that the Gravel

19

case indicates that just because a court clerk happens
