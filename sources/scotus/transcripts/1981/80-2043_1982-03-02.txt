We will hear argument

MR. LIPP*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case is here on certiorari from

10

the Second Circuit,

where a three-judge panel rendered a

11

plurality decision containing a vigorous dissent, with

12

the court afterwards split five to five on en banc

13

consideration.

14

Although this case involves the guarantee of

15

freedom of expression under the First Amendment of the

16

Constitution, it does not involve the utterance of

17

either pure or symbolic speech by any of the plaintiff

18

Respondents in any manner.

contents of nine books removed from the Island Trees

QUESTION;

Suppose they barred the St. James

version of the New Testament, and the Constitution of
the United States, and the Declaration of Independence?
MR. LIPP;

It makes a difference, Mr. Chief

12

Justice, what is in them, but I do think they must be

13

taken as a whole, and each board member did read the

14

full volumes that were involved, but it was these

15

alleged profane, vulgar, indecent materials that caused

16

their initial concern, and I am assuming caused the

17

final action from plaintiff.

18

Justice, that there are many other books that do contain

19

in varying degrees some vulgarities.

QUESTION;

I am aware, Mr. Chief

Mr. Liptx, perhaps I should ask your

21

opposition this one, but are any of these named

22

plaintiffs still in school?

The resolution of the Board of

Education, if I am not mistaken, was worded so that the

10

books were to be removed from the curriculum and from

What were the ages of the five

plaintiffs at the time the books were removed?
MR. LIPP;

Mr. Justice Powell, the oldest was,

22

if I am not mistaken, a senior at the time, and the

23

plaintiffs were each year down from that, so I am

24

assuming roughly 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13.

Did the same library serve both

It did not, Mr. Justice.

There were separate libraries?

There were.

MR. LIPP:

I would say that a school board

would be subject to the federal and state laws with

regard to obscenity, and although they might have the

would subject themselves to criminal penalties, but do

it were made to remove from student exposure all

would be subject to examination in the federal courts?

Is there some place where you would draw the line?

is, you started your argument by quoting from Judge

Well, would there ever be any

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S W WASHINGTON D C. 20024 <202\ 554-2345

MR. LIPPs

1

I would hope that there would not

2

be, at least in the face of a complaint and a 9-G

3

statement similar to that in this case, because what you

4

are assuming obviously then is the next step, being a

5

trial.

6

would be justiciable and where it would raise a

7

constitutional issue, but Justice — Judge Mansfield did

8

not state that any one book had all of those elements in

9

them.

There are possibly circumstances where that

I have read the books, and the elements referred

10

to by Justice — Judge Mansfield had varying of those

11

things that he was disparaged about, but no one book had

12

a combination of disparaging remarks about blacks, Jews,

13

and Christ.

14

or two referred to blacks disparagingly, and so forth,

15

and there were obscenities and profanities throughout

One did refer to Christ disparagingly.

So, there was a mixed bag with regard to these

QUESTION;

18

One

I thought Judge Mansfield said

19

there were — he didn't rely on vulgarity for one of the

20

books.

21

MR. LIPP;

He said, with one exception, and

22

that exception is one that contained A Modest Proposal,

23

by Jonathan Swift, that the board felt in bad taste, and

24

this board is a seven-man board.

25

QUESTION;

What I am really trying to find out

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

is, what is the standard that you ask the Court to adopt

2

in deciding whether there is federal review of this kind

3

of decision?
MR. LIPPs

4

I would ask the Court first to hold

5

that the mere allegation that the board or any board

6

followed its own social, moral, and political values in

7

making curricular decisions without further would not be

8

justiciable.

9

probably should be followed, aside from the balancing of

I would also add that the rule that

10

conflicting interests, and I certainly admit that there

11

are many important interests, but they are conflicting

12

in this case, would be that of reasonably related to a

legitimate state function.
Certainly, I don’t think you need to prove a

15
16

QUESTION;

Mr. Lipp, how are books normally

selected for the library in this school district?
MR. LIPP;

The normal selection, Justice

17

Powell, at least that with which I am familiar, and I

18

represent more than one school district, is basically to

19

permit the professional staff from lists submitted by

20

publishers and professional journals to make these

21

selections.

22

immediately remind Mr. Justice Powell of the fact that

23

24

the Chelsey case, a federal judge found fit to restore

The Chelsey case to which I just

SW

WASHINGTON D C. 9nn9A tOr\0\ SKA-93AR

1

referred to, oddly enough, the Justice who restored the

2

poem to the shelves did state that a district or a

3

school district had the power to decide there is no

4

library whatsoever.

5

QUESTION!

What happens to the New York law?

6

MR. LIPP:

In New York State, of course, we

In New York. State —

7

must have a library.

If I am not mistaken, it is in the

8

appendix to the brief.

It requires at least 1,000

10

libraries.

11

Nor would we assert it if we did have it.

12

We would not have that power in New York.

QUESTION:

Mr. Lipp, getting back to the

13

standard which the First and Fourteenth Amendments

14

impose on the board in a situation like this, I find in

15

Judge Newman's concurring opinion in the court of

16

appeals some suggestion that precisely the same

17

objective acts on the part of the board could be

18

permissible or impermissible depending on the motive

19

with which the board did them, and it struck me that

20

test certainly has been applied in discrimination cases

21

under the Fourteenth Amendment, but I haven't seen it

22

applied in First Amendment cases before.

23

MR. LIPP:

I —

24

QUESTION:

What position do you take on that?

25

MR. LIPP:

Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I have not

1

seen it applied in book banning cases, of which there

2

are now a number.

3

Certainly if the motivation again is to ban a theory or

4

doctrine of thought, the motivation is to assert a rigid

5

and exclusive indoctrination with regard to all areas of

6

thought.

7

QUESTION;

Motivation may have some bearing.

Do you find any authority

8

supporting the proposition that something done with a

9

good motive is all right but something done with a bad

10

motive is not all right, if it is precisely the same

11

thing that is done, in our First Amendment cases.

12

MR. LIPP:

I do not know of anything

3

supporting that proposition.

I also would add that it

4

is my understanding or my experience that motivation is

course of a book is not the basis for banning it.

MR. LEVINE*

11

In a conflict between a local

12

school board and a federal judge with regard to the

13

banning of books, a local school board must abide by

14

constitutional standards as interpreted by the federal

15

courts.

That is our position, Your Honor.

But the thing you haven’t told us

whole and consider its literary value, see if it has any

relevance to course material, and they had two or three

24

other guidelines in there.

I don’t really know what your standard

and then the committee followed the recommendations, as

they did not here, and removed three books and kept

five, or six, or whatever the number is.

that was still unconstitutional.

any impartial observer, a teacher, a book expert would

MR. LEVINE:

If they made those judgments on

the basis of the kinds of criteria, educational

suitability, assuming that was fleshed out in relevance

15

to the community, that would be perfectly permissible.

That process goes on —

MR. LEVINE*

No, we took that position,

2

however, and there are depositions in this record, and

3

indeed, the 9-G statement, the Southern — the Eastern

4

District's local rule in summary judgment cases says

5

that some of these books were banned on the basis of

isolated themes, even when the theme of the entire book

was to the contrary.

19

books, and I am omitting a word or two, were removed

bad taste, making them educationally unsuitable for the

district's junior and senior high school students.

Now, I understand, of course, that you don't

let's assume for the moment that you answer that in the

negative.

MR. LEVINE*

No, I don't.
Are you saying that federal courts

boards?

12

I do not whatsoever.
I would like to think we are, but I

MR. LEVINE*

No, and I don't think the federal

courts are better suited to do that, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION*

Hell, what do we do then?

MR. LEVINE*

What has happened — First of all

15

we take issue with the district judge's conclusion.

16

did not concede that in summary judgment.

those inferences.

MR. LEVINE;

I don't think that a school board

there isn’t a claim that there is a single vulgar word
