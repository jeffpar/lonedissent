ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD R. CARPENTER, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. CARPENTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court:
10

The petitioner in this matter, the state, feels

11 there are three principal issues which
12 necessary to discuss in detail.

the petitioner feels

The first issue is whether

13 or not exigent circumstances existed in this case that would
14 have excused the officer of first procuring a

search warrant

15 prior to his entry into the dorm room and seizure of the
16 marihuana seeds.
17

Secondly, whether or not it was proper for the law

18 enforcement officer to accompany the arrestee, Mr. Overdahl,
19 to the dorm room when he asked to be allowed to return to
20 that premises to secure ID from the premises.
21

And thirdly, if this Court should determine that

22 the officer acted in violation of the Fourth Amendment on
23 the first two questions, whether or not this is an
24 appropriate case for the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule
25 to be applied to.

In other words, whether or not the Court

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

should look at the good faith of the officer in this

2 particular case and apply a good faith exception to

the

3 exclusionary rule.
4

QUESTION;

Is the basic predicate of your case

5 that if an arresting officer has probable cause to make an
6 arrest and does so,
7 in

he may keep the arrested person at least

sight if not in hand from that point on?

8

ME. CARPENTER;

9 Justice.

Our approach is that in order to protect both the

10 officer and

and protect the evidence from being

13 should allow
14 presence.

And in order to that, if he wants to be a

QUESTION;

20

It was a return to the premises for the

21 benefit of the arrested person.

MR. CARPENTER;

22
23 the

That’s correct, it was to expedite

release of the arrested person, Mr.

Overdahl.

24

QUESTION;

From your point of view, from your

25 position,

the officer could have appropriately walked in the

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 room and stayed within two or three feet of this man at all
2 times.

Is that your position?

3

MR. CARPENTER:

4

QUESTION

That’s correct.

Wait a minute.

If a man is arrest out

5 on the street, you could carry him across town and go into
6 his room?
7

MR.

CARPENTER:

No.

I'm not saying that.

Only if

8 he requests to return to his premises.
9
10

QUESTION:

But the man didn't invite him, did he?

MR. CARPENTER*

Well no, that’s not really true.

11 The officer asked for ID and the individual indicated, Mr.
12 Overdahl indicated that he did not have ID.

He asked the

13 officer if he could return to the premises.

The officer

14 indicated well, in light of your custodial status I can’t
15 let you return to the premises unless I accompany you, and
16 Mr. Overdahl said okay.
17

QUESTION:

18

MR. CARPENTER:

19 that's not okay.

Well ,

wha t else could he do?
Well,

he could have said no,

Take me down to the station house and book

20 me, handcuff me.
21

QUESTION:

And gone to jail.

22

MR. CARPENTER:

And gone to jail.

The officer was

23 trying to allow him the opportunity to -24

QUESTION:

That was his choice.

It was either let

25 the officer go with him or go to jail.

1

ME. CARPENTER:

2

QUESTION;

That’s right.

Mr. Carpenter, I gather the officer had

3 wanted the ID, did he not, to find out his age,

to use as

4 evidence?
5

ME. CARPENTER;

Well, that's part of the reason he

6 wanted an ID, but you have to remember -7

QUESTION;

Well, he wanted it for at least that

8 much, didn't he, for that reason?
9

ME. CARPENTER;

10

QUESTION;

11

ME. CARPENTER;

12

QUESTION :

13

MR. CARPENTER:

14

QUESTION ;

Well, that’s true.

Did he give Miranda warning s?
No, he did not.

Shouldn't he have?
No, I don't believe so •

Why , if he was going to use this as

15 evidence , wasn't he?
16

MR. CARPENTER;

17

QUESTION;

18 wasn't he?
19

Well, there were three reason s.

He was going to use it as evidence.

That's why he wanted it.
ME. CABPENTEE:

20 collateral reason.

Well,

that may have been a

But the principal reason he needed it,

21 anytime you arrest an individual you have to ID that person.
22

QUESTION;

Well, if we think he should have been

23 given Mirand warnings and he didn't have them -- you agree
24 he didn't -- wouldn't that taint everything after that?
25

ME. CARPENTEE:

Well, --

1

QUESTION;

2

MR. CARPENTER;

3

QUESTION;

4 had

Well wouldn't it?

Under our cases?

Not necessarily,

because --

Under our cases, that he should have

them ?

5

MR. CARPENTER;

Well, what would be Mr.

Chrisman's

6 standing to complain about Mr. Overdahl's violation of his
? Miranda rights?

That would be my answer.

Plus, the officer

8 had a right to be out in that public hallway, regardless of
9 whether or not he asked for his age.

The dorm room and

10 public hallway of Orton Hall was public area; it constitutes
11 an unprotected area, he had a right to be there.

And that's

12 where he saw the principal observations before he went in
13 under what we say was exigent circumstances.
14

QUESTION;

Mr. Carpenter, before you leave the

15 point, I'm still a little uncertain.

Why was the ID

16 important?
17

MR. CARPENTER;

18 can look at pages 7, 9 and

You have to remember -- and you
10 of the Joint Appendix and

read

19 through those pages, and you will see that the officer had
20 three violations he was aware of.

He was aware of a

21 violation of being in possession of alcohol and in violation
22 of a Washington statute, not being 21 years of age.
23

QUESTION;

Right, but he didn't need the ID to

24 establish that because the young man had admitted he was 19.
25

MR. CARPENTER;

At the elevator before they

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 ascended to the 11th floor.
2

QUESTION;

Once he admitted it, then why did he

3 need the ID?
4

SR. CARPENTER;

Because he has two other

5 violations.
6

QUESTION;

And what were they?

7

MR. CARPENTER;

One was a violation of the

8 Washington Administrative Code which prohibits from having
9 alcohol on the campus -10

QUESTION;

Well, he’s on the campus; he didn’t

11 need an ID for that.
12

SR. CARPENTER;

And the third one would be he had

13 an open container of alcohol, another criminal violation.
14

QUESTION;

He didn’t ID for that either, did he?

15

MR. CARPENTER;

Kell, you need it -- I would

16 gently suggest that you need an ID anytime you arrest a
17 person.
18

QUESTION;

Why?

If I'm arrested out on the street

19 somewhere, do I have to have an ID?
20

MR. CARPENTER;

W'ell sooner or later, when you get

21 booked in you are going to have to identify yourself, aren't
22 you?
23

Are we going to book him in as a John Doe and hold -QUESTION:

He knew his name.

Do you have to have

24 an ID in writing in order to identify yourself?
25

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, in 1978 there were
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 approximately 16,000 students on WSU campus.
2

QUESTION:

You’re not suggesting that this man

3 didn't know his own name, are you?
4

MR. CARPENTER;

No, but I would suggest that it

5 would be rather foolhardy for an officer to take his word as
6 to what his name was.
7 campus.
8

There are a lot of students on that

We see a lot of John Smith's.
QUESTION:

But didn’t he intend to take him to the

9 station?
10

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, no, he was trying to allow

11 him to be released.
12

QUESTION:

Does the record show that?

13

MR. CARPENTER:

14

QUESTION;

I believe it does.

The man is a man that admits he's under

15 21, with a half a gallon of liquor.
16

MR. CARPENTER;

That’s right, a half a gallon of

17 gin .
18

QUESTION;

And the policeman is going to let him

19 go?
20

MR. CARPENTER; Well, he

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CARPENTER: He would

would issue

--

Yes or no.
issue him auniform

23 citation —
24

QUESTION:

Is it your story that he was going to

25 turn him loose?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HE. CARPENTER;

Sure, he would issue him a uniform

2 citation for a minor violation and then he would have to
3 appear in District Court.
4

QUESTION;

I thought you said a minute ago he had

5 a choice of taking him to the room or jail.
6

HR. CARPENTER;

That's right, if you don't furnish

7 some ID, you're going to jail.
8

QUESTION;

Now you say he wasn't going to take him

9 to jail; he was going to give him a slip of paper.
10

HR. CARPENTER;

11

QUESTION;

12

(Laughter.)

13

HR. CARPENTER;

No, let me back up an explain.

I hope so.

His

choices are that if

I can’t

14 resolve this with some adequate ID so I can identify you and
15 issue you a uniform citation so you can appear in seven days
16 in Whitman County District Court to answer the criminal
17 charge of minor possession -- it's not

something that they

18 routinely book people for -19

QUESTION;

When he first encountered

this

young

20 man, did he have any way of knowing whether the young man
21 was, in fact, a student?
22

HR. CARPENTER;

No.

Other than that hecame out

23 of Orton Hall, he appeared to be very young, appeared to be
24 obviously under 21.
25

QUESTION;

There's a great many people of that age

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 who might come out of that hall and have no connection with
2 the university.
3

MR. CARPENTER;

Sure.

He has no idea.

As you

4 remember, Mr. Overdahl suggested that he be allowed to
5 return without the officer, and I think it would be rather
6 naive to think that a young man disappears -- now maybe this
7 young man would have come back, but I would suspect good
8 police procedure would lead one to be a little cautious
9 about letting a man on a campus with
10 dorm.

I doubt he’d ever come back.

11 personal reaction.

16,000 disappear in the
I mean, that’s just my

If I was a law enforcement officer I

12 wouldn’t let him out of my sight.
13

QUESTION;

Well, why didn't you give that answer

14 to me when I asked you that question?
15

MR. CARPENTER;

16

QUESTION;

I thought I did, but I --

Well, you didn’t give it until you got

17 it from the Chief Justice.
18

MR. CARPENTER;

19

QUESTION;

I apologize.

Well, I thought you gave it to him, you

20 gave it very clearly in response to my question.
21

QUESTION;

Mr. Carpenter, when he got upstairs,

22 did I understand you to say earlier that there were exigent
23 circumstances which

justified his entry into the room?

24

MR. CARPENTER;

25

QUESTION;

Right.

And had there not been is the

1 1

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

implication that he could not have entered the room?

2

ME. CARPENTER;

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, I --

In the absence of exigent circumstances?
I believe he could have entered on

5

either one of the state’s principal theories.

6

you have to remember, he was only at the doorway 35 to 45

7

seconds.

8
9

QUESTION;

Either as --

I know, but what I’m trying to get, Mr.

Carpenter, do I understand your position to be that in the

10

absence of exigent circumstances, he should not have entered

11

the room?

12

MR. CARPENTER;

No, that is not my position.

I

13

believe there are two ways he could have entered that room.

14

One, to accompany the arrestee, and I argue in the brief

15

that if it is not a simultaneous entry, it's a

16

contemporaneous entry.

17

he’s standing there and then walks in.

18

the fact that he paused at the door for 30 to 45 seconds is

19

not a great deal of constitutional significance.

20
21

22

QUESTION;

I think it's -- 35 seconds while
It seems to me that

And what are the exigent circumstances,

assuming that there -MR. CARPENTER:

Okay.

The state would argue that

23

the exigent circumstances in this particular case are simply

24

that if the officer had left, the tray of marihuana seeds

25

which he observed approximately eight feet in the room from
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

where he was standing would have I think clearly been gone

2 when he

came back.

Or it's reasonable to assume that they

3 would have been gone.

There were two people in the room;

4 they could have eaten them,
5 body cavities,
6 and I

they could have hidden them in

they could have thrown them out the window,

won’t speculate what the dispersion pattern from the

7 11th floor of marihuana seeds if

you flip them out the

8 window.
9

But I think it's reasonable, as the trial court

10 and the Court of
11 reasonable for

Appeals both concluded, that it was not

the officer to leave that room to get a

12 warrant.

13

QUESTION;

Now, incidentally,

the officer had a

14 radio, didn’t he?
15

MR. CARPENTER;

16

QUESTION;

17 that he summoned

That is correct.

And it was after he entered the room

help on the radio .

18

MR. CARPENTER;

19

QUESTION;

That is correct,

Why do you suppose he didn't summon

20 help while he was at the door where he could
21

MR. CARPENTER;

see everything?

Well, he could have summoned

22 Lieutenant Kenny -23
24 still
25

QUESTION;

He could see both the people, he could

see the seeds -MR. CARPENTER;

Then we’d have two officers

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 standing at the door if he can’t enter.
2

QUESTION;

What was the rationale used by the

3 court below in this decision?
4

MR. CARPENTER;

Which court?

The Washington

5 Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals or the trial court?
6

QUESTION;

I said the court below, the one

7 immediately below is the Washington Supreme Court.
8

MR. CARPENTER;

Oh, excuse me.

Their rationale

9 was one that we never -- that there were not exigent
10 circumstances and we didn’t argue them, which is clearly
11 erroneous because the record is replete from our trial
12 memorandum that we argued exigent circumstances.
13

The other was simply that New York vs. Payton and

14 Reddy prohibited entry without a warrant.
15

QUESTION;

Would it be your position that if the

16 office was accompanying this young man down the hall and he
17 was headed from room B, which was another few steps, but he
18 walked by room A and he glanced into the room and s aw
19 very same things tha t he saw in this case; namely, wh
20 it was on that stand
21

•

MR. CARPEK TER;

Everything from that poin t

22 proceeds the same?
23

QUESTION;

And then he enters that room , saying

24 these things are in plain view ,

I can enter this room and

25 seize them because of exigent circumstances.

Is that your

14

1 position?
HR. CARPENTER*

Kell, you have to remember in this

3 particular case -4

QUESTION*

5

MR. CARPENTER:

No, just take my facts.
Well, are th e facts the same?

I

6 mean, in this case Mr. Overdahl opened the door all the wa y .
7

QUESTION*

Well , the door is standing open and

8 they are both walking by, and all of a sud d en the office r
9 sees wha t he saw in this case sitting on th e stand.

11

MR. CARPENTER:

Wou Id

•

And he sees the occupant who

12 respo nds to him?
13

QUESTION*

14 on the stand

No, no occupant a t all.

He just sees

what he sees here.

15

MR. CARPENTER:

16

QUESTION*

17

MR. CARPENTER*

Kell,

there' s a lot more here.

Well, how about my question?
Okay, he walks by an open room and

18 he sees the seeds.
19

QUESTION*

He sees those seeds standing there --

20 he sees what he saw in this case.
21 they were seeds.
22

He doesn’t really know

He had to go over to find out.

MR. CARPENTER:

Assuming no one associated with

23 the room or otherwise sees the officer and knows he has seen
24 something, no, there wouldn’t be.
25

QUESTION*

It's just like if you were walking by a

But here there is an appreciable

QUESTION;

Yes, and then what?

He sees a nervous reaction of Mr.

QUESTION;

Well, if he saw the same thing through

if he was walking by on the street, he looked in the

16 window and he saw
17 looking

what he saw and he saw a man in there

nervous and was about to destroy them, could he go

18 in ?

I'm not assuming anything.

MR. CARPENTER;

Well, if it's apparent the man

I would think so,

yes.

It's his home, isn't it, for --

I just wanted to eliminate any

That’s right.

And this is an

There's no question in my mind from reading the

And you've been talking now

for quite a

21 while, or responding to some questions about situations
22 where officers looking through windows and standing at
23 doorways, as to what rights they may have.

I would think

24 you would argue this case as to the rights of an officer
25 where he has made a lawful arrest to stay with the party

2 those circumstances.
3

MR. CARPENTER;

4

QUESTION:

I think that's correct, Justice.

Doesn't the fact that this involved a

5 lawful arrest and a search incident to arrest distinguish
6 this case from much of what we've been talking about?
7

MR. CARPENTER:

I think that's correct, and that's

8 the second principal issue in this case.

I think this case

9 can be decided either on the first issue or the second issue.
10

QUESTION:

Mr. Carpenter, I’m confused now.

I

11 have heard you talk about exigent circumstances, I have
12 heard you talk about search incident to a lawful arrest, and
13 I think I've heard you talk about plain view.
14 you 're really relying on?

What is it

Are you relying on the fact, as

15 you allege it to be, that the officer was in a place where
16 he had a right to be and he saw items, contraband, in plain
17 view?

Or are you relying on exigent circumstances, or

18 search lawful -- incident to a lawful arrest, or all three
19 or what ?
20

MR. CARPENTER:

Yes, Justice O'Connor,

21 unfortunately, the last court before this Court, the
22 Washington Supreme Court -- and not to criticize that court,
23 but I think it improperly labeled where the officer was as a
24 nicety, and they said we're not going to decide that issue.
25 I think it's pretty important.

QUESTION:

MR. CARPENTER:

Well, what are you relying on?
Our position is -- and I suppose

rely on both the exigent circumstances; one, what he saw

think I'm arguing that we have the best of both worlds.

what the thrust of your argument is.

MR. CARPENTER:

3

QUESTION:

Well, unlike Justice O'Connor, who has

4 recently joined our Court, do you think that any of the
5 courts in the country or any prosecutor or any defense
6 lawyer can be faulted for being somewhat confused about the
7 state of Fourth Amendment law?
8

ME. CARPENTER:

Well, I've been practicing law for

9 ten years, and the cops always call me up at 3:00 in the
10 morning and want me to give them a precise answer to the
11 Fourth Amendment, and I can't do it.

I think it's so

12 enamored with constitutional subtleties and what I like to
13 call the crafting of legal technicians that we've totally
14 confused not only the lawyers and the judges, but the police
15 officers who are supposed to be constitutional lawyers out
16 in the street and making a 15-second decision to decide what
17 the U.S. Constitution means.
18

All I'm saying in this case is that the conduct

19 was reasonable.

The officer did what was reasonable under

20 the status of the law clearly in 1978, in any event.
21 was before Mincey vs. Arizona and before Payton.
22 very confusing area.

That

It's a

This case is important maybe to

23 clarify what -- first of all, what is an exigent
24 circumstance.

I, for the life of me, could not find a real

25 good U.S. Supreme Court case that clearly found an exigent:

QUESTION*

Mr. Carpenter, on the question of

4 exigent circumstances, the Chief Justice gave you examples
5 of seeing a gun or a dead body or something like that.

QUESTION:

Kr. Carpenter, are you familiar with a

5 case we decided last June, I think the title of it was New
6 York against Belton?
7

KR. CARPENTER:

Yes, I am.

And I think you

3 decided Robbins or something like that the same day.
9

QUESTION:

Yes.

But the Belton case, as I recall,

10 involved an officer who stopped an automobile and made a
11 lawful arrest and the Court held that the officer was
12 entitled, without a warrant, to search anything in the
13 driver’s compartment of the car -- passenger compartment of
14 the car.

KR. CARPENTFR:

That’s right.

QUESTION:

Anything that he could find there.

18 Now, the plain view doctrine certainly applies -- I've
19 always understood it -- when an officer makes a lawful

Why do you avoid relying primarily on that issue?

21 Am I overlooking something?

KR. CARPENTER:

I excuse myself.

Well, I suppose if you can find

3 three ways to hang your hat on it, I -- you know, in

6 two or three years, so we try to cover the issues.

We try

(Laughter . )

QUESTION;

I guess you can hang your hat on

10 whichever one you want.
11

MR. CARPENTER;

I'd like to have my convictions

12 sustained.

QUESTION;

Now, there is a difference between the

14 Belton case and this.
15 automobile,

There we had the mobility of an

which had a special character.

Here you have an

16 immobile place.
17

MR. CARPENTER;

But the language I find particular

18 significant maybe to this case and Belton and maybe the
19 Robinson and Gustafson cases, are the Court’s observations
20 that arrested people are very unpredictable.

You know, an

21 officer has to do enough to protect himself.
QUESTION;

Well,

thi s officer might rea so nably be

repri manded for not having gone in and followed him around
to be sure he wasn *t going to cc>me out to the door with a
sawed -off shotgun in his hand.

MR. CARPENTER:

I would not have done what this

I would have gone in immediately.

Because if

3 you look at the record you will see that the young man gets
4 into a drawer or a closet or something.
5 not a pistol or something in there?

Who knows there’s

I just think that he

6 should have done a little more to protect himself than he
7 did, but like I said, they're trying to act lowkey on the
8 campus.

They don't want to get a lot of bad publicity.

9 That's pretty clear from the Joint Appendix.
10

QUESTION:

Counsel, does the record show when this

11 man was given his Miranda warning?
12

MR. CARPENTER:

Okay, he was first given his

13 Miranda warnings after the officer seized the tray of
14 marihuana.

At that point, he gave both the occupants their

15 Miranda warnings, and at that juncture asked if there was
16 anything else in the room, and at that point Mr. Chrisman
17 went ahead and volunteered the little box the officer had
18 seen him carrying around.

It had $112 and some marihuana in

19 it.
20

QUESTION:

So he wasn't given Miranda warnings --

MR. CARPENTER:

MR. CARPENTER

3

QUESTION;

That's correct

And yet, the purpose of the ID was for

4 the liquor.
5

MR. CARPENTER;

Well, the purpose of the idea, the

6 state would like to say is that you have tc ID anybody that
7 you arrest.
8

QUESTION;

Where did you get that idea that you

9 have to get an ID everytiie you arrest a man?
10

MR. CARPENTER;

11 police procedure.

Well, I believe it’s correct

You have to ultimately book them under a

12 name, and you have to verify them, and when you have -- we
13 do have a problem with people even appearing in our district
14 court under phony names.

I prosecuted a couple young men a

15 couple months ago on just that.

They went clear through the

16 conviction stage using a phony name.
17

QUESTION;

Is there a requirement that you

18 identify yourself?
19

MR. CARPENTER;

Well, I think it's reasonable for

20 an officer to ask them; I don’t know if you can force
21 somebody to identify himself, but I think it's reasonable

Is it reasonable to take a man back to

5 do you?

MR. CARPENTER;

Well, I think he doesn't have a

MR. CARPENTER;

13 has to have a modified right there.
14 let him go back by himself.

It's not reasonable to

At least, that's the state's

15 position .
16

QUESTION;

Mr. Carpenter, can we be certain the

17 Washington court based its decision on the Fourth Amendment
18 to the federal Constitution rather than on the Washington
19 constitutional provision?
20

MR. CARPENTER;

Justice O'Connor, that’s one issue

21 the respondent, argues in their brief, and, of course, we
22 argue that there’s absolutely no discussion of Article I,
23 Section 7 in the Washington state constitution in our
24 decision.

They talk about the Fourth Amendment and they

25 talk about Payton and Rettig, and it seems to me clear that
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that's what they decided the case on.
2

Now, looking at the Simpson case cited by the

3 respondent, we argue that's really just a limited case on
4 standing in response to this Court's case Racus.

looking

5 at, I think it's State vs. Smith, it's in my reply brief,
6 the Court clearly a couple years ago in Washington said that
7 the two sections. Article I, Section 7 of the Washington
8 constitution and the Fourth Amendment of the U.S.
9 Constitution should be substantially interpreted the same.
10 And so, it's the state's position that they should be, and
11 that's what was done.

I think it's mere speculation on

12 respondent's part that it could have been.

Whether it could

13 or couldn't, it doesn't appear that they ever talked about
14 the Washington state constitution in this case.
15

If there are no further questions, I would like to

16 reserve the remainder of my time for rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT F. PATRICK, ESQ.

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

21

MR. PATRICK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

22 the Court;
23

If this case is to be decided on federal

24 constitutional grounds, I would submit to the Court that a
25 fundamental precept of the Constitution, that possibly this
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 case should be considered in conjunction with or determined,
2 is a portion of the Constitution which is seldom cited and
3 neither counsel has cited, frankly, but seldom cited because
4 it's part of the Preamble, and that part of the Preamble
5 says "to secure the blessings of our liberty to ourselves
6 and our posterity."
7

QUESTION:

Well, the Preamble has never been

8 considered part of the Constitution for adjudication
9 purposes, has it?
10

MR. PATRICK;

No, Your Honor, no, it has not.

But

11 I think that the Fourth Amendment was adopted in part to
12 give rise or life to that portion of the Preamble; that is,
13 "to secure the blessing of liberty", and part of the
14 blessing of liberty would be the right to be free from
15 unreasonable search and seizure.
16

QUESTION:

Well, are you suggesting that, Mr.

17 Patrick, to negate the thought that the policeman, once
18 having placed this man under arrest, had a right, if not a
19 duty, to keep him within arm's length at all times until he
20 had completed all the formalities?

Any question about that

21 in your mind?
22

MR. PATRICK:

I have to say to Your Honor that it

23 is my judgment that the police officer probably had, as long
24 as he had placed the individual under arrest, that the
25 police officer could be with him as he went wherever this

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 individual went
2

I do not believe, however, that the police officer

3 had the right to accompany this -- to have this individual
4 go to his room to secure the identification.
5

I also would submit to the Court that the police

6 officer did not have the right to accompany him specifically
7 into the room -8

QUESTION;

Whose idea was it to go to the room?

9 The officer's or the arrested persons's?
10

MR. PATRICK;

I believe it was, in essence, the

11 officer because the officer left the individual no choice.
12

QUESTION;

Isn't it ambiguous from the Supreme

13 Court of Washington where it says at page 35 of the Petition
14 for Certiorari, "The officer noticed the bottle of gin and
15 suspected that Overdahl was under the age of 21.
16 Overdahl and requested his identification.

He stopped

Overdahl stated

17 that he would have to go upstairs to his room to get the
18 identification.

Officer Daugherty required that he would

19 have to accompany him to his room."

It's kind of hard to

20 say from that description, isn't it, who -- whether there
21 was insistence on one party or the other?
22
23 Honor.

MR. PATRICK;

Not from our standpoint, Your

I submit that the insistence was for ID, and the

24 officer wanted that ID.

Not having advised Mr. Overdahl of

25 his Miranda rights, he did not have the right to insist on

1 there were no Miranda warnings?
2

HR. PATRICK;

No,

I do not believe at that point

3 that the arrest was lawful, Your Honor, because the police
4 officer at that point knew that he could not get past
5 basically a motion to dismiss at the trial if all he came
6 before the judge was -- if all he brought before the judge
7 -- was I've arrested this individual and this individual
8 looks like he's under 21, to me.

QUESTION;

Wasn’t he charged for just having

10 liquor on the campus?
11

MR. PATRICK;

12

QUESTION;

I beg your pardon?

Wasn't one of the charges just being in

13 possession of liquor on the campus?
14

MR. PATRICK;

That was in violation of a

15 Washington Administrative Code, Your Honor, but the police
16 officer indicated that he would not have arrested that
17 individual,

in essence, for that;

there would be no criminal

18 actions.
19

QUESTION;

What the officer's subjective intent

20 was I don't know is controlling.

He had, in fact, committed

21 a violation of that regulation.

QUESTION;

Well, do you make any point of the fact

2 he didn't get them?
3

MR. PATRICK;

4

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

Even though he conceded he was 19,

5 without the Miranda warnings you suggest, or you argue, that
6 the arrest was still unlawful?
7

MR. PATRICK;

Yes, Your Honor.

I am arguing that

8 when the officer said, I will accompany you to the room,
9 that he now had put -- he had so restricted Mr. Overdahl's
10 freedom of movement that he was now under arrest.

And at

11 that time he had a duty to advise Hr. Cverdahl of his rights
12 under Miranda.
13

I believe it happens that that arrest may --

QUESTION;

I'm sorry, but how can the respondent

14 take advantage of the failure to give Miranda warnings to
15 his roommate?
16

MR. PATRICK;

17

QUESTION;

Because it is the --

The failure to give Miranda warnings

18 doesn't viciate the arrest, does it?
19

MR. PATRICK;

But that's what led directly to --

20 as indicated in our brief, that's what led directly to the
21 opening of the door, which was a giving up of the right of
22 privacy to the room.

And under -- then that brings into

23 play Bumper and, I believe, Crewes that -24

QUESTION;

I simply don't follow this argument.

25 If the arrest is valid, it doesn’t matter whether he gave

1 Miranda warnings or not, does it?
2

MB. PATRICKS

I believe that -- yes, Your Honor, I

3 believe it does because he wanted to get that ID for proof
4 of an element of the offense.
5

QUESTION;

Well, you would infer that; your

6 opponent infers something different on that.

But regardless

7 of his motive, if he made a valid arrest, as Justice Powell
8 has suggested, what difference does it make whether -- I
9 just don't follow your argument.
10

MR. PATRICK:

The reason that it becomes

11 important, Your Honor, is that the sole reason for going to
12 that room was for identification.

The identification would

13 have -14

QUESTION:

Done two things.

He could have

15 ticketed him without taking him to the station, and he would
16 have had written as well as oral proof of age.
17

MR. PATRICK:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.

Granted all that, still, now what's

19 your argument?
20

MR. PATRICK:

I believe that at that point, not

21 having advised him of his rights to Miranda, he did not have
22 a right to, in essence, insist that the individual goes to
23 his room, or even, there was no need for the individual to
24 go to his room.

And I believe that the police officer then

25 took advantage of the situation to get the individual to his

2

QUESTION;

3 give Miranda

I still don't follow.

The failure to

warnings makes subsequent statements

4 inadmissible in evidence.

Is there any doctrine that says

6 police officer

to take a person in custody to his room?

MR. PATRICK;

Yes, Your Honor, when going to the
evidence.

And so the evidence is inadmissible.

17 Overdahl to

a pulp and said open the door, and Mr. Overdahl

21

22 because of

I believe that Mr. Chrisman could

as effectively would have standing to assert

20 the manner in which

that door was opened.

Because his privacy to the room was invaded
a violation of his co-tenant's right to privacy.

of the item; not -- at that point the officer is at

he hadn't violated the roommate’s rights.

MR. PATRICK;

That is correct, that assumes that

at the door.

QUESTION;

Hell, doesn't that cut back on your

16 point a little bit?
17

MR. PATRICK;

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PATRICK;

Yes, Your Honor.

It's not absolute, is it?
No,

it is not, Your Honor.

I

20 believe he would have a better case to go in to seize it for
21 his own

protection.

But still and all, it was there because

22 of a violation of constitutional rights.
23

QUESTION;

Well, suppose it was poison there.

24

MR. PATRICK;

25

QUESTION:

I beg your pardon?

Poison, which can kill just as easily

And which can also be poured down the toilet

2 and disposed of.

MR. PATRICK:

In this case, there was no toilet in

Was there a window in the room?

MR. PATRICK:

There was a window in the room.

It could be thrown out of the window.
Yes, if they wanted to break the

QUESTION:

I just don’t understand how you can

That's my problem.

MR. PATRICK:

QUESTION:

Your Honor, --

Even if I think it helps the other guy,

22 I don't think it helps your client.

Now, does that make it

23 clear?
24

MR. PATRICK:

Yes, Your Honor, but as I indicated,

25 I believe that the police officer, as far as my client, Mr.

3 finally, through an act of submission, opened the door, -4

QUESTION;

Which is not here.

5

MR. PATRICK;

6 going to be the same.

No, but the principle I think is
A violation of a constitutional right

7 should give the co-tenant the right to object to the manner
8 in which the privacy was given up.
9

QUESTION;

You mean the right -- looking into an

10 open door is the same as breaking the door down.

MR. PATRICKi

For constitutional --

MR. PATRICK;

QUESTION;

15 follows.

Supposing he lawfully arrested him downstairs, and

There's a little bit of difference.
Well, Your Honor, if you —

Mr. Patrick, I wonder if even that

16 on the way up he heated him up in the elevator and violated
17 his constitutional rights.

And then said, I still am going

18 to follow you into the room.

If he has a right to follow

19 him into the room, the fact that he beat him up in the
20 elevator wouldn't destroy that right, would it?

I mean,

21 there would be remedies for what he did, but I'm not sure
22 one of the rememdies is that he has to turn him loose.
23

MR. PATRICK;

I don’t believe he has to turn him

24 loose, Your Honor, but I'm not sure that he can -25

QUESTION;

Well, if he can keep him under arrest

1 and if you can stay with your arrestee and go into a room,
2 it doesn’t seem to me that if you did something else that’s
3 very wrong on the way in has changed the legal posture at
4 all .
5

MR. PATRICK;

I think that if you fail -- if you

6 violate the individual's rights and in violating those
7 rights of that individual, the constitutional rights of that
8 individual -9
10

QUESTION;

Beat him up in the elevator.

MR. PATRICK!

Right, Your Honor.

If that goes to

11 the validity of the consent to go to the room -12

QUESTION:

Under the theory, at least the one

13 Justice Powell has been suggesting, he didn’t need consent.
14 He had the man under arrest, and the man goes in the room,
15 he has a right to follow him in.

And I’m just suggesting

16 that he doesn't lose that right because he did something
17 terrible in the elevantor; if he has the right.
18

MR. PATRICK;

You may be right, Your Honor, unless

19 it goes to the consent of the individual to go to the room,
20 and then I have to go back to the proposition -21

QUESTION;

But see, if you have the arrest

22 situation, then you don't need the consent.
23

MR. PATRICK:

Except that, Your Honor, just simply

24 because an individual is under arrest doesn't mean that the
25 police officer has to take him to the room.

1

QUESTION;

I see what you're saying.

2

QUESTION;

One more hypothetical.

He does

3 everything you say to one of the men, and as he gets to the
4 door, the wind blows the door open and he sees all of that.
5 He can't seize it.
6

Do you want to bet?

MR. PATRICK;

Where the wind has blown the door

7 open?
8

QUESTION;

Yes.

Just as he got there.

Fortuitous

9 wind.
10

MR. PATRICK;

I think that’s a fortuitous event

11 all right, Your Honor, but constitutionally -- well again,
12 we go back to the proposition -- I have to go back to the
13 proposition that the police officer was there because, under
14 our theory of the case, he had not adequately advised the
15 individual of his rights under Miranda, and therefore -16

QUESTION;

Well the police officer employed by the

17 university sure had a right to be standing in that hallway.
18

MR. PATRICK;

He had a right to be in the hallway,

19 that' s true .
20

QUESTION;

And the door blew open, on my

21 hypothetical.
22

MR. PATRICK;

I think, Your Honor, that when the

23 doorway was blown open, it has not now come open by an event
24 which one of the defendants was in control of.
25 parties was in control of.

None of the

It's a little bit like the Chief
42

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Justice's question I think where the police officer is
2 bringing Mr. Overiahl down the hall and the police officer
3 sees some marihuana in another room.

And in that case, I

4 would say he could go in.
5

QUESTIONS

But the Chief Justice says you might

6 have to get a warrant, but you said he doesn't even have to
7 get one.
8

MR. PATRICK:

No, no, I'm sorry, Your Honor, I

9 don't mean to infer that he didn't have to get a warrant.
10

QUESTION:

I thought that you just said that that

11 would be a different case and the officer could do it.
12

QUESTION:

But failure to give Miranda warnings

13 does not viciate an otherwise lawful arrest, does it?

It

14 just means that a motion to suppress may be granted, but
15 we'll suppress items that were surrendered by the victim
16 under the -- because of the failure to advise him of his
17 rights.

It doesn't mean that the state can't prove its case

18 by other evidence.
19

MR. PATRICK:

20 that is correct.

That’s my understanding, Your Honor,

I do not believe that the state can prove

21 its case by evidence that would arise from the individual.
22

QUESTION;

Well, that's -- but this isn't the same

23 individual.
24

MR. PATRICK:

But it is an individual who is in

25 the same position, as I indicated earlier -- at least I
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 would submit to the Court that when the individual has
2 when a co-tenant has given up the privacy of the premises
3 becuase of a violation of that co-tenant’s rights, the
4 non-consenting co-tenant should, I submit, stand in the same
5 shoes, because it is the protection of the privacy of the
6 premises that I believe is at stake.

And this Court has on

7 several occasions indicated that it will certainly assert
8 and recognize the rights of the people who are -- who have
9 possessory interest in the property, although that is not
10 necessarily the key.
11

But again I believe that Bumper handles the

12 standing question in which the mother, I believe it was, who
13 owned the premises gave -- acceded to the request of the
14 police officers to come in under the proposition that they
15 had a search warrant.

And it was the defendant then who was

16 given standing to assert that the entry was invalid because
17 it was under the mistaken hypothesis that the police officer
18 did have a search warrant.
19

QUESTION;

Tell me, Mr. Patrick, assuming there is

20 no infirmity whatever in the arrest of Overdahl and they
21 went up to the room, as they did, might not — or do you
22 think the officer could accompany Overdahl into the room?
23

MR. PATRICK;

Under the facts of this case. Your

24 Honor —
25

QUESTION;

No, I suggsted them.

If there is no

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 infirmity whatever in the arrest of Overdahl.

You go up to

2 the room because Overdahl has said, I want to get the ID for
3 you.

Could not the officer accompany him into the room?

4

MR. PATRICK;

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. PATRICK;

7

QUESTION;

8 he couldn't?

The Washington Supreme Court said no.

What do you think?
Ah —

And why not, if you're going to answer

I would suppose the officer would be able to

9 be sure that he wasn't going to be attacked or assaulted.
10

MR. PATRICK;

That's why I said I didn't think so

11 under the facts of this case.

I can understand why a police

12 officer would want to be in a position where he could
13 protect himself from an attack or an assault.
14

The problem is, in this case, a police officer's

15 actions did not give any indication that he had any concern
16 about that.
17

QUESTION:

Because he stood in the doorway instead

18 of entering, is that it?
19

MR. PATRICK;

He stood in the doorway, he had not

20 frisked the individual before he got there, at least the
21 record doesn't disclose that he did.
22

QUESTION:

Let’s suppose, however, that he had

23 entered.

Would there be anything wrongful about that entry?

24

MR. PATRICK;

25

QUESTION;

If he had gone into the room?

Yes.

If he had gone in with Overdahl.

we cited in our brief,

the theory is that there are

valid for the police officer to accompany the individual

7 into the room.
8

QUESTION:

Incidentally, there is no suggestion

9 that the Washington

Supreme Court decided this case under

10 the

MR. PATRICK:

QUESTION:

MR. PATRICK:

25 -- if this Court

That is correct. Your Honor.

Well, do you suggest they did?
Yes, I'm suggesting that this Court

believes that the search could be upheld

U6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 under federal constitutional grounds, I believe that the
2 case should be remanded back to the State Supreme Court to
3 see if the State Supreme Court decided the case under the
4 state constitution.
5

QUESTION:

Why did the State Supreme Court cite

6 all the federal constitutional cases if it was deciding it
7 under the Washington constitution?
8

MR. PATRICK;

I believe, Your Honor, that the

9 concept that the states can interpret their own constitution
10 and can grant additional rights over and above those granted
11 to the federal Constitution frankly is of relatively recent
12 origin, and I don’t think it's been thoroughly thought out,
13 frankly.

I believe in Kr. Justice Brennan's Law Review

14 article he propounded that proposition.
15

And I think that frankly, part of the reason would

16 be, although it's up to the state supreme court to say for
17 themselves, but I would think that part of the reason is
18 that the state supreme courts have grown so accustomed to
19 examining questions in light of what they think the United
20 States Supreme Court is going to rule, that they are very
21 used to taking precendent from the U.S. Supreme Court.
22

And I believe, however, that in the future, as

23 this theory is -- we all have more experience with this
24 theory, it would not surprise me to see state supreme court
25 decisions resting their decision on their state
47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 constitutional grounds where it is their view that
2 additional rights are granted under their respective
3 constitutions.
4

QUESTION;

But we’re reviewing a judgment here

5 that's not in the future but was rendered in the past.
6

HR. PATRICK;

That is correct, Your Honor.

But

7 one of the authorities cited by the state supreme court was,
8 as I say, the State vs. Daugherty.

Now, State vs. Daugherty

9 itself cited some federal cases and some state cases, and I
10 did review some of those state cases and again, those cases

11 cited are also state and federal cases.
12

I believe that the state supreme court could have

13 decided this case under the state constitution, and as I
14 indicated earlier,

if this Court feels that the state

15 constitution -- or rather, that the federal Constitution was
16 not violated by the search, then I would request the Court,
17 again, to remand it back to the state supreme court for a
18 determination as to whether or not the search could be
19 sustained under the state constitution.
20

QUESTION;

Isn't the test whether it did decide it

21 rather than whether it could have decided it, under Privda
22 and Minnesota vs. National Tea and those cases?
23

MR. PATRICK;

Your Honor, I think that may well

24 be, but I think that where the supreme court, or where the
25 case -- if the case were to be reversed and go back to the

48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 trial court, I would think that if the trial court then were
2 to sentence the individual and impose a sentence, that
3 again, we would probably be faced with trying to go back up
4 to the state supreme court and give the state supreme court
5 an opportunity to rule on the constitutionality of -- under
6 the state constitution.

And T believe it would avoid a lot

7 of circular action if it were simply to go back to the state
8 supreme court.
9

QUESTION;

Of course, this business of deciding

10 cases on state constitutional principles rather than federal
11 is nothing new.
12

We've been doing it up here for a long time.

MR. PATRICK;

Yes, Your Honor, that is true.

But

13 I think in the -- I believe certainly in recent history
14 under the state court -- under the constitutional
15 principles, the state supreme courts have -- particularly
16 after Mann -- have become accustomed to following the
17 precedent of the U.S. Supreme Court, and feel -- I believe
18 for a time felt pretty much locked in by the precendents set
19 by this Court.

And the state supreme court then should be

20 allowed, I submit, to decide this case on state
21 constitutional principles, if the Court determines that this
22 case should not be decided as incorrect under federal
23 constitutional principles.
24

QUESTION;

Mr. Patrick, on that point, did you

25 tell us — I want to be sure I understood what you were
49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 saying -- that there is a state constitutional doctrine that
2 more or less classifies certain offenses as very petty
3 offenses and that if this offense is in that category, that
4 as a matter of state law, the entry into the room might not
5 have been justified by the fact that the man was under
6 arrest.
7

MR. PATRICK*

and were at that point outside the

5 room, now the nature of the situation when he determines to
6 enter the room, it seems to me, has been changed.
7 now -- he was at the

He has

room for one purpose and is outside

3 that room and has now decided

for whatever reason to go into

9 the room, and I submit at that point, under the knock and
10 announce rule, he should -- while he might not have had to
11 knock; I don't think he would have had to knock, but I do
12 believe that he should have announced his purpose to enter
13 the room.
14

QUESTION;

Kell, Ker in California held that the

15 knock and announce rule was not a constitutional rule,
16 didn 't it?
17

MR. PATRICK;

It was my understanding that it was

18 of constitutional proportion, or at least it's my
19 understanding that the state -20

QUESTION;

That's what the dissent said in Ker and

21 California.
22

MR. PATRICK;

I believe that our state supreme

23 court has determined that it is of constitutional
24 proportions.
25

In summation, if I could simply say to the Court
52

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that in this case, if the police officer were outside the
2 room, and if the Court finds exigent circum stances, he
3 created his own exigent circumstances.

He could have

4 maintained the status guo and did not.

He could have

5 maintained with his radio a guard at the door while a search
6 warrant was obtained, and we submit that where we are
7 talking about protection to the dwelling, the protection in
8 maintaining the right to privacy, that where a reasonable
9 opportunity exists to obtain a search warrant and preserve
10 the status quo, that this Court will require that the status
11 quo be maintained and that a search warrant be obtained and
12 that the entry be made pursuant to a search warrant.
13

Thank you, Your Honors.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Do you have anything

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD R. CARPENTER, ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- REBUTTAL

18

MR. CARPENTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

19 please the Court, -20

QUESTION:

Do you think that opinion can be read

21 as resting on your statement?
22

MR. CARPENTER:

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. CARPENTER;

Which, theChrisman opinion?

Yes.
No, I believe

itcannot.

And I

25 particularly believe it cannot because of State v. Smith.

1

QUESTION':

2

ME. CARPENTER:

3 ambiguous.

Do you think it's even ambiguous
No, I don't think there's anything

It's true that it did cite a state case, State

4 v. Daugherty, which cites a whole series of other state
5 cases, but those state cases are talking about
6 interpretation of the U.S. Constitution primarily; they're
7 not talking about the U.S. Constitution.
8

The only case of recent times that is helpful to

9 underline any disparity in the two constitutions is State v.
10 Simpson which talks about the standing problem.

State v.

11 Smith decided in 1977 clearly makes the point that the two
12 constitutional provisions should be given the same effect.
13 And it's only that point of departure on standing that our
14 court made a difference.
15

I think the record is helpful in some of the

16 things we've been talking about.

I'd ask the Court when it

17 has a chance to look at the Joint Appendix Page 35, and I
18 think that clearly shows the trial court’s findings of fact,
19 which show that it was Mr. Overdahl’s desire to go back to
20 the room, and that his response to the office was okay, he
21 could accompany him.
22

Also, a fact that got maybe lost in the wash a

23 little bit here is that the third violation, also a criminal
24 violation, was that -- and it's replete in the Joint
25 Appendix references -- is that it's a violation of criminal
54

1 law and Washington law to have an open container out in
2 public, and that's another reason the officer could have
3 arrested him, and one of the reasons he cites at the
4 suppression hearing in the trial court.

QUESTION:

NR. CARPENTER:

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. CARPENTER:

9

QUESTION:

10

An open container of gin?
Of alcoholic beverage.

The gin --

In this case, gin.
Yes.

However old you are.

MR. CARPENTER;

However old you are, if you're 65

11 it doesn’t matter.
12

QUESTION:

Mr. Carpenter, what about --

13

QUESTION:

That isn't old.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. CARPENTER;

16

QUESTION:

I didn't imply it was old.

What about Mr. Patrick's suggestion

17 that there are certain very minor offenses with respect to
18 which when an arrest is made, the arresting officer could
19 not follow the man into the room?
20

MR. CARPENTER;

No, I don't subscribe to that

21 theory and I don't think our court said that.

I think our

22 court just felt that the U.S. Constitution required -- I
23 think they may have thought in their principal opinion that
24 the U.S. Constitution made some distinction between serious
25 and non-serious cases.

I think that is sort of ludicrous

1 because the officer is threatened,

his protection is just as

2 much at stake.

3

QUESTION;

Well, in the opinions last spring.

4 Justice Stewart referred to custodial arrests.

Do you

5 remember that in one of the cases?
6

MR. CARPENTER;

7

QUESTION;

Yes, I remember.

Do you think that was kind of

8 non sensical?

9

MR. CARPENTER;

10 in
11

Well, let me just say it this way

the most diplomatic way I can, I think that it is

unrealistic to say that officers have to articulate some

12 specific threat

to them.

Because by the time they find out

13 about the threat, they are probably either going to be dead
14 or severely injured.

Maybe that's a very callous look at

15 society, but we have some bizarre things going on in today's
16 society.

It's not the peaceful society of 200 years ago.

17

QUESTION;

So your view would be all arrests are

18 considered -19
20 the

MR. CARPENTER;

All arrests.

There's jeopardy, as

amicus points out in their brief, in all arrests.

21

QUESTION;

Until you get on bail.

22

MR. CARPENTER;

23

The other thing is I really don't think this

That's correct.

24 Miranda issue, the guestion at the elevator -- I would
25 suggest is somewhat of a red herring.

You have to remember

56

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 that they were already going back to the room to get ID when
2 he asked him about his age and he said it was

19.

Now, what

3 effect does the fact that he may have violated his Miranda
4 rights at that point?

They were still going back to the

5 room, that's where they started, that's where they were
6 headed when
7 11th floor.

they went into the elevator and ascended to the
So it doesn't add or subtract anything.

He was

8 never prosecuted, the state never attempted to use that
9 statement against him for any criminal prosecution.

I think

10 it just doesn't naturally follow that that somehow affects
11 the arrest in this case.
12

As the Court of Appeals aptly observed on page 24

13 through 26 of our Petition for Certiorari, the section where
14 the Court of Appeals talked about that, and they say it's
15 just of no constitutional significance.
16

I see my time is up.

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen, the
