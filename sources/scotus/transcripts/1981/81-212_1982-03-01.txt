ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

9

MR. GELLER;

10

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

11

may it please the Court, this case and United States

12

against Erika, the following case, involve challenges to

13

the procedures established by Congress for determining

14

medical reimbursement claims under Part B of the

15

Medicare program.
The Medicare program is divided into two

16
17

parts.

Part A provides insurance for hospital and

18

related post-hospital services, and is fully funded by

19

payroll taxes paid to the federal government through the

20

social security system.

21

provides a voluntary program of supplementary medical

22

insurance covering in general 80 percent of the

23

reasonable charges for certain other services, primarily

24

physicians* services and such items as medical supplies,

25

laboratory tests, and ex-rays.

Part B, which is involved here,

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE . S W

WASHINGTON D O 90094 f9091 SK4-9S4K

1

Benefits under Part B are financed in part by

2

direct federal government contributions and in part by

3

monthly premiums paid by people who are 65 years of age

4

or older or disabled and who choose voluntarily to

5

enroll in the Part B program.

6

Under the Medicare statute, the Secretary of

7

Health and Human Services determines whether an

8

individual is eligible to enroll in the Part B program.

9

If the Secretary determines that an applicant is not

10

eligible, the applicant has an opportunity for a hearing

11

before an administrative law judge, and if necessary, to

12

judicial review of that determination.

13

Now, in contrast to these eligibility

14

determinations, the individual benefit reimbursement

15

determinations under the Part B program are not handled

16

directly by the Secretary.

17

administration of the Part B program requires a

18

determination of a vast number of individual claims for

19

reimbursement submitted by or on behalf of some 27

20

million beneficiaries.

21

million medical reimbursement claims were processed.

22

The day to day

In 1980 alone, more than 150

When it enacted the Medicare Act in 1965,

23

Congress concluded that a reimbursement program of this

24

magnitude and complexity could be administered most

25

efficiently and conveniently by private insurance

1

carriers, because these carriers, in conducting their

2

own insurance business, had acquired considerable

3

experience and expertise in determining whether, for

4

example, physicians' services are medically necessary

5

and in calculating the reasonable charge for a variety

6

of medical services in their particular community.

7

Accordingly, Congress in the Medicare Act

8

authorized the Secretary to enter into contracts with

9

private insurance carriers under which the carriers

10

would determine and pay Part B benefits on a

11

raimbursible non-profit basis.

12

the carriers receive advances of funds which they then

13

pay to claimants in reimbursement for medical services

14

that are found by the carriers to be covered by Part B,

15

medically necessary, and reasonable in amount.

16

Under these contracts,

The contracts also provide for the government

17

to pay the carriers' necessary and proper costs of

18

administering the Part B system.

19

functions, the carriers act as agents of the Secretary.

In all of these

20

Now, the challenge in this case is to the

21

procedures provided under Part B when a claimant is

22

dissatisfied with a carrier's reimbursement decision.

23

Under regulations promulgated by the Secretary, if a

24

claimant does not agree with the carrier's initial

25

decision regarding the amount of reimbursement for

particular services, the claimant may require a review

of that initial determination.

file is then conducted by an employee of the carrier

4

other than the employee who made the initial

5

determination, and the claimant may submit additional

6

evidence or legal or factual argument in support of the

7

claim at issue.

9

A review of the entire

If after that review determination the
claimant is still not satisfied with the carrier's

10

decision, the Medicare Act requires the carrier to hold

11

a "fair hearing" on all claims in which there is more

12

than $100 in controversy.

things like that?
MR. GELLER;

3

Yes, I mean, they — well,

normally they would be held, for example, at the

5

attorney’s office.

6

Let me put into perspective what we are talking about

7

here.

8

Medicare claims submitted.

only about two million went beyond the stage of the

As -- Out of that figure,

11

review determination stage, and out of that two million,

12

there are only about 26,000 that went to the fair

13

hearing stage.

14

carriers would be figured on processing 158 or whatever

15

it is million claims, and the hearing officer would only

16

be compensated for conducting a very, very minor

17

percentage of the total Medicare picture, so the

18

administrative expenses that are attributable to the

carrier are very, very small.

MR. GELLER:

Those regulations.

In addition,

the Secretary publishes a carriers* manual and the

are reprinted in the Joint Appendix, and to which I

would ask the Court to turn.

are construed, or how certain reasonable determinations

2

are made?
HR. GELLER;

3

Well, the carrier's private

4

business serves as a ceiling beyond which a Medicare

5

payment cannot be made, so there is no reason to think

6

that — it is not a floor.

7

that the carrier in its private business would be

8

hindered or in any way encouraged to do anything —
QUESTION;

9

There is no reason to think

les, but wouldn't it be interested

10

in having precedents establish the fair and

11

reasonableness of the ceilings it has used in its

12

private business?
MR. GELLER;

13

No, the hearing officer has to

14

take into account in determining the reasonable charge

15

the same sorts of things that the carrier takes into

16

account in his private business.

17

QUESTION;

Right.

18

MR. GELLER;

For example, the physicians’

19

customary charge, the prevailing charge in the

20

community.

21

of that, the fact is, he still under the statute cannot

22

pay anything more than the carrier itself would pay for

23

the same sort of claim in its private insurance business.
I think there is an important point to be made

24
25

Now, after the hearing officer has done all

here.

We can't lose sight of what the district court

including the fact that the reasonable charge can't be

more than what the carrier pays in its private insurance

1

expenses made by hearing officers who are totally

2

independent of the carriers that administer the Part B

3

program, and the district court gave essentially two

4

reasons for suspecting that the carriers’ hearing

5

officers were not and could not be impartial.

6

One was this notion that Justice O’Connor

7

alluded to earlier, that perhaps the hearing officers

8

have some financial interest in the decisions that they

9

make, and the second reason that the district court gave

10

was what the district court termed the hearing officer’s

11

"vicarious involvement in the claim."

12

district court meant that the hearing officer works for

3

the carrier that has twice before denied the claim, and

4

the notion is that the hearing officer might be

5

reluctant to overturn a decision made at two previous

6

levels of the carrier.

By that the

7

What the — Based on these conclusions, the

8

court struck down the review provisions of the Part B

9

Medicare program, and ordered that the Secretary afford

20

the right to a de novo hearing before an administrative

21

law judge in the Department of Health and Human Services

22

to every person whose Part B claim was denied in whole

1

Sow, the government has taken a direct appeal

2

to this Court under 28 USC 1252 to challenge this

3

extraordinary holding of the district court.

4

district court has declared unconstitutional the

5

specific procedural mechanism devised by Congress to

6

deal with a massive medical insurance program involving,

7

as I said, some 27 million beneficiaries, nearly 200

8

million in this fiscal year, individual claims for

9

reimbursement, $10.5 billion worth of benefits, and in

The

10

its place, the district court has ordered the Secretary

11

to establish an administrative review system within the

12

Department of Health and Human Services that Congress

13

expressly considered and rejected.

14

Now, in reviewing this decision, we believe it

15

is important for the Court to keep in mind that the

16

district court in finding a violation of the due process

17

clause did not point to anything in the Medicare statute

18

or the Secretary’s regulations to suggest that the fair

19

hearings offered to Part B claimants by the carriers

20

denied claimants a meaningful opportunity to be heard.

21

Moreover, the district court did not point to

22

any evidence drawn from the accumulated experience of

23

carrier-conducted hearings in scores of thousands of

24

cases over the last

25

Congress and the Secretary were wrong in believing that

I don’t -- there may not be any

models, but I am not sure there are any models for the
Part B Medicare program to begin with.

11

QUESTION:

Yes, I know.

12

MR. GELLER:

I think what Congress had in mind

13

was to sort of parallel and to create as minor an

14

inconvenience as it could for the health care industry

15

when it set up the Part B program, and therefore it

16

assumed that the best way to process these millions and

17

millions of claims was to delegate that authority —
QUESTION:

18
19

So in that sense, this is an

original, isn't it, this kind of procedure?
MR. GELLERi

20

Yes, it is, but — but my point

21

is that it is not simply the review procedures that are

22

unique.

23

and I think that the review procedures have to be viewed

24

in the context of what Congress was trying to do in

25

setting up in 1965 this entirely new and unique program.

The whole Part B Medicare program is unique,

QUESTION;

But do we have to look at that and

focus on that in weighing the validity of this —
MR. GELLER;

I think — I think the Court, in

14

considering this case and in considering the Erika case,

15

has to, in adjudicating the plaintiffs’s claims in each

16

of those cases, consider the entire program, and I think

17

that it would be appropriate in considering whether

18

procedural fairness has been met here, to consider the

19

fact that Congress has not allowed for judicial review,

20

but I think it is important to keep in mind that the

21

Court has to find that the administrative process

22

violates due process.

is procedurally proper, but it is close to the line, and

to restructure the administrative process.
I don't think that the courts have any power

2
3

to restructure the system that Congress has devised

4

unless they find that the system in some specifically

5

articulated way violates elementary due process, denying

6

the claimant the meaningful opportunity to be heard, or

7

not an impartial decision-maker.

8

Court will be able to identify any aspect of the Part B

9

hearing system in this case that falls below minimal

standards of due process.
It is important to emphasize, as Justice

11
12

O'Connor asked me earlier, that neither the carriers nor

13

the hearing officers have any direct or indirect

14

pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case.

think, an officer of the Occidental Life Insurance

reasons.

7

we don’t deny the fact that carriers, insurance carriers

8

would like to be part of the Part B program, but if any

9

inference can be drawn from that, it is not the

10

inference, I think, that the plaintiffs draw, which is

11

that they would seek at every turn to deny meritorious

12

claims.

13

fact that carriers would like to be part of the Part B

Yes.

MR. GELLER*

No.

It is our position that we

are entitled to summary judgment, because there is

nothing on the face of the statute and the plaintiffs

have not suggested any lines of factual inquiry that

could lead a judge to conclude that the Part B system

amount of evidentary materials submitted here, both

MR. GELLER:

8

Apparently, that is what the

9

district court thought, although there is a line of

10

cases in this Court, such as Ward versus Village of

11

Monroeville, which seems to suggest that if there is a

bias at some sort of adjudicatory level, it is not cured

by having a de novo level of review on top of that.

Even judicial review.

That’s

solve the problem, which I think comes back, once again,

to the fact that the district court simply had some

MR. GELLER;

No.

In fact, the district

court, as I recall, pointed out that no one had

challenged the judicial preclusion provisions of the

Part B Medicare Act.

Therefore, I don't think, there is any reason
to believe that a carrier would jeopardize its

10

relationship with the Medicare program by exerting

11

influence on a hearing officer to deny an otherwise

12

meritorious claim, or that a hearing officer would act

13

in that unseemly fashion on his own in the belief that

it would somehow place — please the carrier and make it

more likely that he would be hired as a hearing officer

in the future.

17

Exactly the opposite is the case.

The hearing

officer and the carrier have every incentive to be

scrupulously fair.

If the Court has no further questions, I would
like to reserve the balance of my time.

WASHINGTON O C 20024 12071 554-2345

1

please the Court, this case presents two issues.

2

first issue is whether the due process rights of

3

Medicare claimants are violated when the hearing

4

officers who make final, unreviewable decisions on

5

claims appeals serve at the pleasure of the insurance

6

companies that have denied the claims.

7

is one of the remedy, whether the appeal ordered by the

8

district court to the Secretary is the appropriate

9

remedy.

The

The second issue

10

Counsel has made a number of comments about

11

evidence in this case, and I think it is important to

12

understand that the standard that this Court has

13

recognized about the requirement of a fair tribunal is

14

that our system of justice seeks to avoid the

15

possibility and even the appearance of bias, and thus

16

the standard is one of whether the circumstances

17

presented pose to the average man sitting as a judge a

18

possible temptation not to decide fairly.

19

It is important, therefore, that we grasp the

20

critical facts of this complex program to understand why

21

in fact carriers do have a direct financial interest in

22

the outcome of Medicare claims, and why it is not an

23

extraordinary exercise of the imagination, as counsel

24

has stated, to so find.

25

As Justice Stevens commented, there is a very

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

close connection between policy decisions that are made

2

with respect to the private carriers* own claims and to

3

their functions as Medicare contractors.

4

whether they are holding a Medicare contract or

5

administering their own private plans, they have the

6

same dual mission.

7

of their policyholders, or in the case of Medicare,

8

federal funds, and secondly, they are to honor the

9

claims benefit — the claims decisions — excuse me, the

In fact,

First, they are to protect the funds

10

claims that are submitted to them under a prudent and

11

cautious interpretation of their policies.

12

If the carrier treats federal funds less

13

cautiously than its own, its own financial interest is

14

jeopardized, as the Secretary has the option not to

15

renew a carrier's contract, which is only for a one-year

16

term, without a showing of cause.

17

mandates carriers to treat Medicare claims in

18

essentially the same manner as if it were their own

19

money being spent.

20

Thus, the statute

In addition, it is important to understand

21

that there is a very straightforward way in which

22

carriers have a direct financial stake in the outcome of

23

Medicare claims decisions.

24

private policies for the elderly, commonly known as

25

Medigap insurance.

This is through supplemental

These supplemental policies have

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

become more needed as medical care costs have gone up

2

and as the differences between actual costs of care and

3

Medicare reimbursement have increased.

4

Medicare carriers, as counsel has indicated,

5

have the name recognition that accompanies their names

6

going out on thousands of checks to the beneficiaries.

7

This name recognition gives them a competitive advantage

8

in obtaining business under the Medigap programs.

9

and in fact, the Secretary’s relationship with the

Thus,

10

carriers does not deny the existence of the Medigap

11

programs, but in fact in Article 24 of the contract,

12

which appears in the record, the carrier specifically

13

authorizes the — the carrier is specifically authorized

14

to integrate its Medicare and Medigap claims

15

processing.

16

This leads to an inevitable financial stake

17

for carriers in the outcome of Medicare claims, since

18

whan the carrier pays less on a Medicare claim, the

19

result is that there is less paid on the Medigap claim.

20

This happens because Medicare does not pay the actual

21

charges for covered services, but only what a carrier

22

determines to be an allowed charge.

23

deductible when a claim has been met. Medicare pays 80

24

percent of an allowed charge, and Medigap pays 20

25

percent.

Assuming a

The supplemental plan, or Medigap plan, is not
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

liable for the difference between the allowed charge and

2

the actual charge, which is ordinarily picked up by the

3

beneficiary.

4

Thus, and similarly, when a carrier is holding

5

a Medigap policy and the issue is one of medical

6

necessity, if there is a determination that the

7

procedure is not medically necessary under Medicare,

8

that also means that the Medigap policy does not — does

9

not cover the claim.

for the 20 percent claim, doesn't he?

15

MR. SOHNEN:

Hell, the way the contracts are

16

written, the Medigap contracts simply refer to what

17

Medicare has decided, so that ordinarily under a private

18

plan which had no connection with Medicare, there would

19

be the right of review by arbitration or the courts, but

20

here, the Medigap plans simply refer to the level that

is set by Medicare.

MR . SOHNEN:

problem that is at the heart of this system, because in

their private operations, the carriers do not have to

make the final review of their own claims.

perhaps the hearing officers were granting as many as 50

7

MR. SOHNEN:

There was -- there was that

8

evidence, but there was also evidence indicating that

9

the Secretary's own staff viewed those statistics as

10

being distorted.

There was evidence that these

11

statistics fluctuated according to technical variations

12

in the carriers' policy as to when they conducted a —

13

when they resolved matters at the review stage as

14

opposed to the hearing stage.

statistics mix corrections of computer type errors,

16

which abound, with substantive decisions where the

carrier's policy was at stake.

In responding to Justice O'Connor's

question, it seems to me you are arguing as though you

had prevailed after trial and gotten a judgment or a

2

verdict below, and simply saying there is evidence to

support the verdict, but as I understand, it went off on

4

summary judgment, so that any point of disputed evidence

5

would be resolved against you.
MR. SOHNEN:

6

We think that the -- the

7

constitutional issue in this case is whether there is a

8

right of independent review, and the relationships that

9

prevent an independent review are undisputed, and appear

10

in the face of the statute essentially as I have

described.

MR. SOHNEN:

1

As I indicated in response to

Justice White’s question before, something short of de

novo review does not cure the problem of biased

4

decision-making.

5

if its — as it sees its jurisdiction under the Tucker

scope.

The court of claims has indicated that

MR. SOHNEN:

QUESTION:

MR. SOHNEN:

Well, even narrower than that.
Oh, really?
I believe that it would be -- it

12

would be limited to questions of constitutionality and

13

questions of statutory interpretation.

14

findings of fact and applications of the law to the

15

facts would not be reviewable, and these are so many of

16

the cases that we have before us.

17

Thus, erroneous

For example, Mr. McClure’s case involved --

18

Mr. McClure was a resident of a remote community in

19

northern California.

20

physician in that community felt that immediate surgical

21

intervention was necessary to save his life.

22

therefore concluded that a facility in San Francisco was

23

the nearest appropriate place for him -- for him to be

24

treated, and he went — he was sent to San Francisco.

25

His life was saved.

He suffered a heart attack.

an air ambulance under Medicare, despite the fact that

2

there was ho evidence indicating that his doctor's

3

physician — his physician's testimony — his

4

physician's opinion was incorrect, the Medicare hearing

5

officer decided that there was a closer appropriate

6

facility.

7

Now, that is the type of case that would never

8

be reviewable in the court of claims under the

9

jurisdiction that they have asserted.

10

QUESTION:

I am trying to sort out to what

11

extent you are claiming bias taints this result, or

12

whether it is just general incompetence, just the

13

general chance of arriving at unsound conclusions.

14

MR. SOHNEN:

I think that — I think the

15

gravest concern about this system is the fact that no

16

independent review is available, and the fact that —

MR. SOHNEN:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SOHNEN:

I know, but --

Yes.
— that doesn't answer my question.
Well, I think I can respond to

21

your question with a followup to that, which is that the

22

fact that the competence of these hearing officers is

23

determined as part of this close relationship between

24

the hearing officer — between the carrier and the

25

hearing officers aggravates the fact that there is a
39

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

concern about bias.

2

QUESTION:

Well, if all the insurance carriers

3

involved in this program together created a pool of

4

hearing officers who didn't work for any of them and

that they have gotten now, and drew them by lot, would

required in that -- on those facts?

12

be your objection is basically that this is just an

13

unsound way of deciding cases.

HR. SOHNEN:

If it is, it must

I think that the — if a system

insulated from the carrier whose decision he was

now leaves --

HR. SOHNEN:

Yes.

from the Secretary about qualification, I -- I think

25

that that would be of the nature of independent review.

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARVEY SOHNEN, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES - CONTINUED

6

MR. SOHNEN*

Yes.

May it please the Court, in

7

answer to Justice Marshall's question prior to the

8

break., what this case poses is not simply the issue of

9

the possibility of bias, but the extent of the

10

constitutional requirement for a competent and

11

independent review of Medicare claims to protect the

12

integrity of that program, and for that reason I would

13

like to elaborate on my answer to Justice White’s

14

hypothetical.

15

If carriers are given the ultimate

16

responsibility for making decisions on Medicare claims,

17

we still have the problem of the interweaving financial

18

interests between the carrier's own policies and the

19

Medicare program, and in addition, any — any new

20

program of that nature would certainly involve costs

21

that are — that are not currently involved.

22

In our — It is our position that a fair

23

hearing in the first instance is possible in the

24

Medicare program at no extra cost.

25

in the record that the cost of administrative law judge

we have been challenging.

Does the record tell us how big -- what the

MR. SOHNEN:

Yes.

The record indicates that

12

years ago is the latest statistic.

13

the amounts range from the minimum of $100 to the costs

14

of major surgery.

About two

Of course, these —

So, it would be our position that rather than

16

creating a new structure that is still in the hands of

17

the carriers, the fairest, most economical method would

18

be simply to replace the current system with —

19

QUESTION:

Well, if you are right, if you are

right, why, it seems to me that you really ought to move

had been treated even worse, the ones who accept their

— the way the claim is disposed of by the carrier.

12

MR. SOHNENi

I think that we have to draw a

13

distinction between the choice of Congress to — to

14

place the administration of a massive system of this

15

nature in the hands of the private sector and this very

16

original characateristic of this program whereby the

17

final decisions are also placed in the private sector,

Brennan referred to —

QUESTION:

Well, there are an awful lot of

MR. SOHNEN:

2

I think that there is — in our

3

— in the history of governmental operations, there has

4

been a great deal of experience with using the

5

competence of the private sector.

6

this case is that the final say is in the private

7

sector.

and in fact, it is not just the district court that has

11

QUESTION:

12
13

Well, in fact, I think -At least that is arguable, is it

in the record that indicates that there are many reasons

is a mix of different kinds of cases, different -- and

2

different concerns.

3

distinguished by the wide range of issues that are

4

covered, and so — and it also — and it is also

5

important to note that the 27 million individuals in

6

this system are elderly for the most part, or disabled,

7

and that the kinds of claims in their very nature often

8

don't lead to extensive litigation.

9

The Medicare system is

As I was indicating before in my response

10

pertaining to the Erika decision and the idea of review

11

in the court of claims, there are certain -- there are

12

some kinds of cases that simply don’t generate massive

13

litigation, but to — but to draw the inference that a

14

system is completely fair because — because it is not

15

used is, I think, a not completely wise position.

16

I think, if I could continue with the -- the

17

statement — my concerns about the originality of this

18

system, the experience of our system with private

19

boards, private operations of this kind has always

20

allowed a wide scope of review.

21

which allows no review from the insurance companies, is

22

to be contrasted with private occupational licensing

23

boards, where there is extensive judicial review.

24
25

The Medicare system,

For example, in the case of Gibson versus
Berryhill, which was the Alabama Optometry Board, that

48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

is a case in which there were bias concerns about the

2

tribunal, and the tribunal was struck down

3

notwithstanding the fact that there was extensive

4

judicial review.

5

So, in a system, as here, where we have given

6

the carriers not only the first say, but the last say in

7

deciding claims, grave constitutional problems arise.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH S. GELLER, ESQ.,

12

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

13

MR. GELLER:

Just a few things, Mr. Chief

14

Justice.

First, the statistics show that approximately

15

50 percent of the claims that are submitted to the

16

hearing officer are reversed, and that statistic,

17

contrary to the suggestion of the plaintiffs this

18

morning, we do not for a minute suggest that those

19

statistics, which have held fairly constant over several

20

years, are in any way distorted or don't reflect

21

realities.

22

errors,

23

morning.

24

the review stage, which is the second stage of the

25

review.

They also don’t reflect computer coding

which is what the plaintiffs suggested this
Most of those sorts of errors are caught at

49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

I

And finally, they don't reflect reversals

1
2

where only about 50 cents is involved, which is another

3

statement that the plaintiffs made this morning.

4

statistics in the record, which are printed in the Joint

5

Appendix, show that the average amount at issue, the

6

average amount that is reversed at these hearings is

7

about $200, which is a very substantial amount when, as

8

my opponent just answered in response to Justice

9

Stevens' question, the amount at issue in any of these

10

hearings total is about $600, and even that overstates

11

the actual amount of each claim, because claims can be

12

aggregated over a six-month period.

13

So, we think that these statistics don’t show

14

any timidity on the part of hearing officers to reverse

15

when they think that the claim is meritorious.

hearing examiners?

Now, if I could just for a minute talk about

this Medigap question that the plaintiffs raised,

because once again it raises the specter which seems to

pervade their entire presentation that there is some

sort of sinister force at work here, while it is true

8

that some Medicare beneficiaries have so-called Medigap

9

coverage, the record doesn’t show that they have that

10

coverage, for example, with the insurance company that

11

happens to be the carrier, the Medicare carrier for-that

area.

13

company that was also the Medicare carrier, even the

plaintiffs* argument on its own terms doesn't make any

sense, because that carrier, the insurance carrier would

claimant had Medigap coverage.

QUESTION*

3

Mr. Geller, if the Act didn't

4

provide for any so-called fair hearing at all, what

5

would be the basis for — what would be the — would you

6

think there would be a reasonable attack on it on due

7

process ?

8
9

MR. GELLER*

I think that would raise a much

more difficult question, since due process requires, if

10

it requires anything, some sort of a meaningful

11

opportunity to be heard before property is taken away,

12

but here there is no guestion --

13

QUESTION*

And the property is the — is the

14

reasonable anticipation of getting reimbursed, according

15

to the statute?

16

MR. GELLER*

Yes, right, after having paid

17

your premium and submitted a claim.

I think the point

18

is — I would like to leave the Court just with this

19

last point -- we don’t think there is any due process

20

problem in the Part B hearing appeal system, obviously,

21

but if the Court disagrees, if they think, for example,

22

as the Plaintiffs allege, that there is too close a

23

connection between the carrier and the hearing officer,

24

then it seems to us that the proper remedy is simply to

25

ask the Secretary to take a closer look and pre-screen

Just try to get rid of the bias.
Get rid of the bias, exactly, if

there is in fact bias.

Thank you.
