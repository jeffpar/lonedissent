OBAL ARGUMENT OF SIDNEY A. COVEN, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. COVEN*

Mr. Chief Justice, and if the Court

9 please, the question involved in this case is whether and in
10 what circumstances an employer-may withdraw from
11 multi-employer collective bargaining after negotiations have
12 commenced.
13

The Petitioner in this case contends that the

14 occurrence of an impasse during such bargaining, in this
15 case one which had existed for more than six months at the
16 time of the withdrawal, and which had been followed by a
17 selective strike against Petitioner alone, not all the
18 members of the group, justifies its withdrawal from the
19 multi-employer group.
20

QUESTION*

Mr. Coven,

you have used the word

21 "impasse".
22

MR. COVEN*

23

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.
Is that a word of art?

What is an

24 impasse?
25

MR. COVEN*

Well, the Labor Board has never made

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 an exact definition of an impasse.

They have found in many

2 cases that an impasse has existed, and many cases have
3 turned on the question as to whether there is an impasse,
4 but neither the Board nor the courts have ever precisely
5 defined an impasse.
6

My definition of an impasse is a situation where

7 the parties have reached the point where there is no longer
8 any progress.

They have reached a deadlock or a stalemate,

9 and neither party has indicated any possibility of any
10 movement whatsoever.
11

QUESTION;

Where there is a real breakdown in

12 negotiations, not just a failure to come to terms on one
13 particular issue?
14

MR. COVEN*

15 in my opinion.

That's correct. Your Honor, in my —

The courts — neither the Board nor the

16 courts have ever said precisely that, but that would be the
17 way I would define an impasse.
18
19 did

20

QUESTIONS

And yet in this very case negotiations

resume.
MR. COVEN*

Yes, Your Honor.

Negotiations did

21 resume, and eventually there was an agreement, but of course
22 we can't tell at this point, looking at it from hindsight,
23 whether such — whether the impasse would ever have been
24 broken if the Petitioner had not
25 the bargaining unit.

— had not withdrawn from

If the parties had remained locked in

1 that ice jam, possibly this might have gone on for years and
2 years.
3

It might have gone on forever without any movement.
It was only when the Petitioner did withdraw that

4 we had what might be called the first beginning of a thaw in
5 the ice jam, and there were certain actions triggered which
6 I will refer to later, which in our opinion, at least, did
7 provide the circumstances under which the impasse or the log
8 jam or the ice jam was finally broken.
9

QUESTIONs

Well, of course, as soon as this

10 company, the employer withdrew> they made an example out of
11 him by striking him, did they not?
12

ME. COVEN:

No, Your Honor.

The strike took place

13 five months before the impasse.
14

QUESTION:

15

MR. COVEN:

Well, were they closed all that time?
The employer was not closed.

He hired

16 replacements, and he continued to operate under the — under
17 the handicaps of a strike, and I might add that there were
18 certain factors in the strike which were the subject of
19 litigation in another matter, but are not before the Court
20 here today.
21

May I make it clear at this point that the

22 employer, in withdrawing from the multi-employer group, had
23 no intent to extinguish its bargaining obligation to the
24 union.

It offered to continue bargaining with the union on

25 a single employer basis.

5

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Coven, at the time of the

2 withdrawal, had all the strikers been replaced?
3

MR. COVEN:

4

QUESTION:

I believe so, Your Honor.
But not until the time of the

5 withdrawal?
6

MR. COVEN:

Well, the record is not clear how long

7 before the withdrawal this happened.

The record only shows

8 that at the time of the withdrawal, all of the strikers had
9 been replaced.
10

QUESTION:

Had been replaced.

11

QUESTION:

Well, would you have had — Why do you

12 say that your duty to bargain hadn’t ended?

If you had

13 replaced them all — you had replaced them all permanently?
14

MR. COVEN:

There are certain circumstances under

15 which the Board presumes there is a continuing majority.
16 never approached the point as to whether or not there was
17 such a continuing majority.
18

QUESTION:

The employer --

It may be that all of your employees,

19 your new employees were union members, or might have been.

20

MR. COVEN:

It may be.

The record doesn’t show

21 that.
22

The Labor Board in this case, contrary to the

23 petition then held by five Circuit Courts of Appeals, held

24 that the withdrawal constituted an unfair labor practice,
25 and the Circuit Court for the First Circuit has affirmed

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

We

1 this position
2

I make note, Your Honors, that since the Court of

3 Appeals decision in this case, two of the five Circuit
4 Courts which had formerly refused to follow the Board
5 position, have adopted the Board's position, and would go
6 along with the Board position..

The other three courts are

7 still standing by their positions.
8

Now, the facts in this case were essentially

9 stipulated.

The company is in the business of laundering,

10 rental, and distribution of linens and work uniforms.

Over

11 a period of many years, or quite a number of years, the
12 company, the Petitioner here, had engaged in multi-employer
13 bargaining with a group of employers who dealt with the
14 Teamsters Union for the driver employees of each of those
15 companies.

Each company had a relatively small number of

16 employees, and they all joined together in collective
17 bargaining.
18
19 current

In 1975, just prior to the expiration of the then
contract, the parties, the employers again joined

20 together in this group, the Petitioner and nine other
21 employers, and commenced bargaining with the union.

The

22 president of Petitioner was a member of the group’s
23 bargaining committee.
24

After a number of meetings, a proposed contract

25 was submitted to the employees for ratification.

The

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 contract or the proposed contract provided for an increase
2 in wages, and was based, as the previous contracts had been,
3 on an hourly rate of pay.
4

The employees rejected that proposed contract, and

5 the union came back at the next meeting and proposed that
6 instead of the hourly rate of pay the employees be paid on a
7 commission basis.
8

This was rejected by the employer's group.

Now, thereafter, and the parties have stipulated

9 that, and the Board has found an impasse in bargaining was
10 reached on May 15th, 1975, and-the main issue in the impasse
11 was whether or not the employees should be paid on

a

12 commission basis or the hourly basis.
13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Coven, you say the parties

14 have stipulated that an impasse has been reached, and yet
15 you say there is no generally accepted meaning of the term
16 "impasse".
17

MR. COVEN*

18

QUESTION;

That is correct. Your Honor.
Well,

what kind of a stipulation is

19 that?

20

MR. COVEN*

Well, I believe that the parties

21 stipulated that whatever the Board defines as an impasse had
22 been reached.

In my view, as I said before, an impasse

23 means that the parties have reached the point where they
24 were just at loggerheads, and nobody was showing any signs
25 of movement, and that is,

I believe, what the parties

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 stipulated to, and that is what the Board found
2

On June 23rd, 1975, approximately five weeks or

3 six weeks after the impasse had been reached, the union
4 called a selective strike against only Petitioner, not all
5 the rest of the employers, but only against Petitioner, one
6 of the ten, and all of Petitioner’s drivers joined the
7 strike.
8

Now, there is nothing in the record to indicate

9 why the union chose the Petitioner only, why they didn’t
10 strike anybody else, but it stands to reason that we must
11 assume that the union had some purpose in singling out the
12 Petitioner, but as I say, the record doesn't show what that
13 purpose was.
14

At that point, substantially all the other

15 employers in the bargaining group locked out their
16 employees.

Thereafter, the parties all hired replacements,

17 and continued to operate with the limitations of the strike.
18

Subsequently, there were a number of additional

19 meetings between the union,

And despite the

25 efforts of a Federal mediator, there was no movement by

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 either party
2

, This went on, as I say, for approximately six

3 months.

During this period the Petitioner received

4 information that two members of the group had been meeting
5 secretly with the union, and although no separate agreements
6 were reached, the Adminstrative Law Judge of the Board who
7 heard this case specificaly found "that before Petitioner
8 withdrew, two other employees in the group secretly had been
9 in direct touch with the union, presumably in an effort to
10 make a separate settlement".
11

After the Petitioner learned of the secret

12 meetings, it, by letter dated November 21st of 1975, and as
13 I say, this was more than six months after the impasse, and
14 almost five months after the strike against the Petitioner
15 had started , the Petitioner notified the union and the
16 employers’ group that it was withdrawing from the group, and
17 that it would thereafter bargain directly with the union.

18

Now, on receipt of this notice by the group, the

19 remaining members of the group terminated the lock-out and

20 rehired all of the persons, the employees who had been
21 previously locked out, and they all returned to work.
22 Thereafter, the group and the union continued to meet.

At

23 the first meeting held after the withdrawal, the union
24 representative merely noted, without saying anything more,
25 that the Petitioner had withdrawn, and the employers'

group

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 indicated or stated that another employer had been
2 designated as a member of the group's negotiating committee
3 to replace the Petitioner's president.
4

The parties had a number of meetings.

There was

5 no change in positions by either party until April the 13th
6 of 1976, approximately four and a half months later, when
7 the union finally receded from its insistence on payment on
8 a commission basis, and agreement was reached on a new
9 contract.
10

Thereupon, the union, which had never communicated

11 with the Petitioner after receiving notice of withdrawal,
12 advised the Petitioner that it considered it, the
13 Petitioner, to be bound by the contract reached by the
14 group, and at that point the Petitioner refused to sign the
15 contract, stating that it was not bound since it had
16 withdrawn from the group a long time ago.
17

The union then filed an unfair labor practice

18 charge with the Labor Board.

The Board, after a hearing,

19 found that an unfair labor practice had indeed occurred,

20 although, as I stated before, five Courts which had
21 considered that question prior to that point had held to the
22 contrary.
23

Now, with respect to the legal principles

24 involved, may I go back to 1950, when the Board in its

25 Morand Brothers decision held that employers have "unlimited

1 1

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 freedom unilaterally to fashion the scope of or to
2 completely destroy multi-employer bargaining at their will
3 or fancy", and squarely ruled that the parties were free to
4 bargain individually after an impasse had been reached in
5 association-wide bargaining.
6

That was the state of the law until 1958, when the

7 Board in its Retail Associates decision set forth a new
8 policy.

The Board said that any employer who is a member of

9 a group can withdraw from that group at an appropriate time
10 before the date fixed for commencement of bargaining, has
11 full latitude,

is absolutely free to leave the group at that

12 point without any inhibitions whatsoever, but that once the
13 bargaining is commenced, the employer, an employer may not
14 withdraw from the group absent mutual consent or unusual
15 circumstances.
16

QUESTION*

Did the Board explain its change from

17 its 1958 ruling to its 1950 ruling?
18

MR. COVEN*

19 Morand decision at

20

No.

all.

No, they never referred to the
They just ignored it.

And it did not address the question of whether an

21 impasse was within the category of what the Board called
22 unusual circumstances.

I may state that in a number of

23 cases since then the Board has subsequently limited the
24 "unusual circumstances” to cases where an employer can
25 demonstrate that it is faced with dire economic

12

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2 or to cases where the multi-employer group has been
3 significantly fragmented as a result of consentual
4 withdrawal.

MR. COVEN;

MR. COVEN;

9

QUESTION;

Mr. Coven?
In 1964
Mr. Coven?
I beg your pardon.
Has the Board, either in this case or

10 in other cases, determined basically whether employers do in
11 fact withdraw from bargaining units because other members
12 have reached interim agreements, and to what extent unions
13 in fact use the whipsaw tactics?

Now, I know that is the

14 theory on which this decision rests.

Now, either in this

15 case or in other cases, has the Board made determinations
16 about those matters?
17

MR. COVEN;

Well, this question as to whether —

18 as to the effect of so-called interim agreements has been
19 only a fairly recent matter that has been considered by

20 Board.

The Board has said that where there has been a

21 significant fragmentation of the unit, the employer is free
22 to withdraw, but it is not — they have never made it clear
23 whether there would

The Board for the first time in this case

25 discussed the difference between what they call separate

1 agreements and interim agreements.

They had never discussed

2 that before.
3

Now, it is still not clear as to whether or not

4 they would consider the execution of a number of interim
5 agreements or how many interim agreements as fragmentation
6 of the group.
7

QUESTION;

Is there any factual finding in this

8 case to the effect that it was the negotiations by the other
9 two employers with the union that triggered the Petitioner's
10 withdrawal?
11

HR. COVEN;

No, Your Honor.

There was no finding

12 at all on that question as to what triggered it.

The only

13 question was whether or not the employer was free to
14 withdraw at that point because of the impasse situation.
15

QUESTION;

Here these independent negotiations of

16 the two employers, did they take place before or after the
17 Petitioner's withdrawal from the group?

They took place before the

The evidence -- the evidence shows and the

20 Board found, the Administrative Law Judge found that the -21 these separate meetings, these separate secret meetings had
22 been held before the withdrawal took place, and it was after
23 the employer learned about this, and there is no finding as
24 to whether that triggered it or what triggered the

25 withdrawal.

QUESTION:

QUESTIO:

MR . COVEN:There was a finding that there were no

We don't know that any action --

6 -- no separate agreements found, but —
7

QUESTION:

All that happened is that there had

8 been these — you labeled them secret meetings.
9

MR. COVEN:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. COVEN:

Yes.
But no agreements reached.
No agreements were reached, but as I

12 say, the — as I said before, the Administrative Law Judge
13 found that there had been these meetings, secret meetings
14 "presumably in an effort to make a separate settlement".
15

QUESTION:

He also added, did he not, that they

16 didn’t even reach the level of negotiations?
17

MR. COVEN:

18

QUESTION:

That is correct. Your Honor.
Mr. Coven, suppose when the union

19 struck your client, your client had said, well, let's
20 negotiate an agreement, and the union said, all right,
21 that's exactly what we wanted.

This is a selective strike.

22 So you negotiated an agreement.

Would that agreement, would

23 you think that you would have had the right to say to the
24 union, well, I will — we will negotiate an agreement, but I
25 am withdrawing from the unit, and this agreement that I am

HE. COVENj

That might have been possible, and if

5

the union had agreed, and if the members of the

association —

7

QUESTION:

Well, the union says, well, we don’t

you but if we then negotiate an agreement with the unit,

10

this contract that we are going to sign with you will be

subject to -- we will throw it out the window.

12

say that you would have the right to hold them to the

13

interim agreement?

14

MR. COVEN:

You would

Well, Your Honor, that would be a

15

matter for negotiations, and if there were no agreement

16

reached there —

QUESTION:

The union says, sure, we'll reach an

18

agreement with you, but it is going to be subject to the —

19

to revision, and you say, well, we will sign the agreement,

20

but it won't be subject to revision.

21

MR. COVEN:

22

Now, to go back —

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Then we have no agreement, Your Honor.

Well, there are interim agreements

signed with individual employers —
MR. COVEN:

Yes.

7

-- when there is a selective strike.
Yes, Your Honor.

There are interim

agreements —
QUESTION;

Is it always understood then that they

will be subject to revision?
MR. COVEN;

That depends on whatever the parties

agree to in their interim agreements.

Now, there have been

8 — there are a variety of interim agreements which I think
9

have been pointed out in one of the amicus briefs.

There

10

are -- the briefs filed by the~Graphic Arts Employers group

11

indicates that there are several varieties of interim

12

agreements which are — have been entered into in that

13

particular type of industry.

14

agreements that I have been familiar with have provided that

15

if and when there is an agreement with the multi-employer

16

group, that those terms will become effective.

MR. COVEN;

Well, I think the Board -- the Board

says that most interim agreements — I don't —

No.

2 industry .
3

MS. COVEN:

They say if such a type of agreement,

4 what they call an interim agreement, has been reached, that
5 is all right, but if those —
6

QUESTION!

It is all right, but it is subject to

7 displacement by the final agreement reached.
8

MR. COVEN;

Not unless the parties have agreed to

9 it, because otherwise you have what the Board now calls
10 separate agreements.
11

QUESTION;

Hell, I will find out from Hr. Come.

I

12 thought the Board's position was as I have stated it.
13

MR. COVEN;

Well, I am sorry.

That is not the way

14 I read the Board's position.
15

QUESTION;

If the NLRB were subsequently, for

16 example, to determine that it wouldn't permit interim
17 agreements to be reached by individual employers within the
18 bargaining unit, or if at some point this Court were to make
19.that determination so that interim agreements were not

20 possible to be reached, would you then find that the NLRB's
21 unusual circumstance test would be satisfactory on
22 withdrawal?
23

MR. COVEN:

Yes, Your Honor.

In the facts — the

24 facts in this particular case, here, I — my own feeling is
25 that it isn't necessary really to go into the question of

I think the interim agreement argument

2 that the courts have examined buttresses our argument, but
3 in this particular case, we have a situation where the
4 parties had been locked in deadlock, and there was
5 absolutely no movement for six months.

There is no prospect

6 that there is ever going to be any movement.

Nobody — if

7 things had continued that way, this might have gone -- might
8 still be going on.
9

We say at this point, bargaining has — or

10 collective bargaining on the multi-employer basis has
11 failed.

It has broken down completely, and for all intents

12 and purposes is irretrievable.

We say there is no point,

13 there is no reason, there is no logic for the Board to
14 insist that an employer — that all the employers stay
15 locked in that frozen position.
16

The Board allows people to withdraw at will before

17 bargaining starts.

Why is the multi-employer unit so sacred

18 that at this point, after bargaining has broken down, they
19 don't permit them to withdraw?
20

QUESTION;

Is it your position then at some point

21 of impasse, for instance, after it has lasted a long time,
22 as was the case here, that that in and of itself should be
23 an unusual circumstance, and that you can disregard the
24 interim agreement problem altogether?
25

MR. COVEN;

Exactly, Your Honor.

QUESTION*

2

NR. COVEN:

Is that your position?
That is our main point here.

That is

3 our main argument, that the purpose of the statute is to
4 encourage collective bargaining and to avoid industrial
5 strife by means of collective bargaining.

Now, this matter

6 of this multi-employer bargaining unit is something that is
7 not set forth in the Act itself.

The Board under the Act

8 must make a determination as to what unit is appropriate.
9 There may be many appropriate units.

At certain points, a

10 multi-employer unit may be appropriate, may be the best
11 under the circumstances, but there reaches a point where if
12 the multi-employer unit has become completely ineffectual
13 and goes contrary to the intent of the statute, there is no
14 earthly reason why the Board should insist that that
15 continue.
16

In this —
QUESTION:

Can a single employer be forced to join

17 a multi-employer agreement?
18

MR. COYEN:

No, Your Honor.

There is no — it is

The multi-employer unit is created by

20 the consent of the parties.

Of course, there may be

21 situations where we'll say that the Teamsters Union has a
22 nationwide or — a nationwide freight agreement, and there
23 is an independent employer who is organized by the
24 Teamsters, and they say, well, in order to have an
25 agreement, you must adhere to the terms of this

In that way, he is forced to, but

there is no agreement, and then he gets struck.
QUESTION:

If he doesn't consent,

Now, the employers themselves could

Isn’t that true?

It could be. Your Honor.

MR. COVEN:

— there wasn't — there is no

evidence that there was such -- such an agreement.

17

withdrew from the unit, the employer's group apparently were

happy to see it happen because they could then terminate the

lockout and get their people back to work, and then they

20 started negotiations again.

QUESTION:

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

1

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NORTON J. COME, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2

3

MR. COME;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

4 the Court, in Buffalo Linen, which was decided by this Court
5 24 years ago, the Court indicated that in 1947, at the time
6 of the Taft-Hartley Amendments., proposals were made to limit
7 or outlaw multi-employer bargaining, but these proposals
8 failed of enactment because there was cogent evidence that
9 in many industries the multi-employer bargaining basis was a
10 vital factor in the effectuation of national labor policy by
11 promoting labor peace through collective bargaining.

12

The Court concluded that Congress thereby intended

13 to — that the Board should continue its established
14 practice of certifying multi-employer bargaining units, and
15 intended to leave to the Board -- the Board *s specialized
16 judgment the inevitable questions concerning such a
17 relationship that may arise in the future.
18

QUESTION;

Is it your position, Mr. Come, that an

19 unwilling employer can be forced by the Board into a

20 multi-employer —
21

MR. COME;

No, Your Honor.

As a matter of fact,

22 Congress enacted Section 8(P)(l)(b) of the Act in '47 which
23 would make it an unfair labor practice for a union to strike
24 an employer for the purpose of forcing him into a
25 multi-employer bargaining unit.

A multi-employer bargaining

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 unit is a consentual arrangement, but once you have that
2 consent, then the Board in — pursuant to its function of
3 establishing appropriate bargaining units, has devised
4 certain rules for governing that relationship so as not to
5 unstabilize the relationship that has been established,
6 one year after Buffalo Linen, the Retail Associates*

and

rules

7 were formulated.

Under those rules, either party is free to get out

8

9 of a multi-employer bargaining relationship which, as I
10 indicated,

was voluntary to begin with, at the outset of

11 negotiations, but once negotiations have started,
12 party — and these rules apply to

neither

the union as well as to

13 the employers — can get out absent mutual consent or
14 unusual circumstances.

Now, for the 23 years that these rules have been

15

16 in effect, every Court of Appeals that has had occasion to
17 pass on

them as a general proposition have accepted them.

18 The controversy has been over whether an impasse in
19 bargaining is an unusual circumstance that would warrant an
20

untimely unilateral withdrawal from a bargaining unit.

21

QUESTIONS

What is the Board's definition of

MR. COMEs

The Board, and I think, it has stated it

22 "impasse "?
23

24 as well as anywhere on Page 41 of its opinion in this case —

QUESTION;

In its brief or in its opinion?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. COME;

It is the appendix to the petition

2 That is the Board decision.

And they are quoting from their

3 opinion in Hi-Way Billboards, which was the first case in
4 which they attempted to really spell out why an impasse was
5 not an unusual circumstance, and they point out that an
6 impasse is only a temporary deadlock or hiatus in
7 negotiations, which in almost all cases is eventually broken
8 either through a change of mind or the application of
9 economic force.
10

Skipping down a bit,-suspension of the process as

11 a result of an impasse may provide for reflection and the
12 cooling of tempers.

It may be used to demonstrate the depth

13 of a party's commitment to a position taken in the
14 bargaining, or it may increase economic pressure on one or
15 both sides, and thus increase the desire for agreement.
16

QUESTION;

Well, then, the Board's view is that an

17 impasse is something that occurs fairly regularly.
18

MR. COME;

19 the reasons why the

That is correct.

And that is one of

Board concluded that an impasse should

20 not be regarded as an unusual circumstance.

It is something

21 that is quite normal in collective bargaining.
22

QUESTION;

Well, what if the Petitioners here,

23 uncertain of the Board's reasoning, and

not familiar with

24 the interpretation which you have just given to the word
25 "impasse", felt that there had been a total breakdown in the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 bargaining framework, and that nothing more was to be
2 accomplished by the multi-employer bargaining unit?
3

MR. COME;

Well, I think that that would not have

4 availed them under the Board's view, and that is one of the
5 reasons why the Board has concluded that an impasse should
6 not be a basis for getting out.
7

An impasse may be difficult to determine in a

8 particular set of negotiations.

Sometimes it occurs fast,

9 sometimes it occurs after more prolonged negotiations, but
10 the bottom line is that in the-Board’s view, as the
11 authorities in our brief show, in

the view of experienced

12 negotiators and mediators in the field, the impasse,
13 experience shows, is ultimately broken.

It does not signal

14 a complete and final breakdown in the negotiations.

It is

15 the time when the mediators step in, if there is one.

It is

16 the time when the parties may resort to economic pressure,
17 as they did in this case, because you had a strike against
18 Bonanno which is privileged under Buffalo Linen, followed by
19 a lock-out on the part of the rest of the members of the —

Mr. Come?

21

MR. COMEi

Yes, Your Honor.

22

2UESTI0N:

It would help me

if you could say

23 whether or not the Board has ever considered that the mere
24 passage of time has brought an impasse as defined to an
25 so

that the employers were free to bargain.

MR. COKE;

Well, I think that that would be a

3 factor to be considered, but it is not the — it is not —
I
4

QUESTIONi

Would that be a factor to be considered

5 in determining whether there were unusual circumstances?
6

MR. COME:

Well, the Board in determining what is

7 unusual circumstances has confined that term basically to
8 two types of situations, one where severe economic hardship.
9 such as bankruptcy or its equivalent, would result to the
10 employer who feels that he has~to withdraw, or a situation
11 where, as a result of the union permitting or consenting to
12 withdrawals on the part of a substantial number of employers
13 has so fragmentized the multi-employer unit that you have
14 only a shell of that relationship that remains.
15

QUESTION*

So that if this impasse had lasted,

16 say, for two years, the Board's position would be the same?

QUESTION:

Yes, but in each instance

where it has

10

MR. COME:

That is correct.

11

QUESTION:

But the Board might reach

a conclusion

12 that a two-year impasse did present an unusual circumstance,
13 might it not?
14

MR. COME:

Well, I think that the Board is —

15 within these rules does try to look at these things on a

QUESTION:

It depends on factors such as what kind

does it not?

I think that it could.

We certainly

21 don’t have anything atypical in this case.
22

QUESTION:

But an impasse by itself, no matter how

never is considered an unusual circumstance

24 which would permit withdrawal by the employer?

MR. COME:

That is — That is the Board's position.

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Come?

2

HR. COME: Yes.

3

QUESTION: Is it the Board'sposition

also that it

4 is a policy of the Board to ensure equality of withdrawal
5 rights from these units, both from the standpoint of
6 employers and unions?
7

HR. COME:

Yes,

it is.

8

QUESTION:

Then

how do youreallydistinguish

9 between the ability of an employer to withdraw in the event
10 of an impasse versus permitting interim agreements to be
11 signed?
12

MR. COME:

The first thing that I want to make

13 clear is that there were no interim agreements here, but in
14 all candor, that has been the problem with the Courts that
15 have had trouble with not regarding an impasse as an unusual
16 circumstance, so the Board in this case and in subsequent
17 cases has attempted to clarify its position with respect to
18 interim agreements, as distinguished from what may be called
19 final, separate agreements.
20

The interim agreement that the Board says does not

21 privilege an employer from withdrawing from a multi-employer
22 bargaining unit is an agreement similar to the one that I
23 believe Justice White was discussing, where the union either
24 as a result of its volition or the employer who is hurting —

QUESTION:

Well, Buffalo Linen didn't say -- it

MR. COME:

Well, right.

12

QUESTION:

That is the issue in this case.

13

MR. COME:

That is.

The point that I am getting

14

to is, though, that the interim agreement that the Board

15

would say is in the economic weaponry area rather than

16

destructive of the unit is an interim agreement that enable

17

the struck employer to operate either under the prior

18

contract or on the basis of the terms that the union has

19

thus far offered to the association, but it is contingent

20

upon being superseded by the ultimate agreement, whether it

21

is better or worse than the — than the —

22

QUESTION:

And the Board says that follows, it is

QUESTION:

1

I am speaking now of one of the interim

MR. COME;

Well, the parties would have to so

provide for the Board to regard it as an interim agreement.

MR. COME:

14

That is correct.

That is correct, and

15

in the Board's view, that is no more destructive of the

multi-employer unit than a situation where you have a

Well, then, that says to me the Board

10 would not find him guilty of an unfair labor practice.
11

MR. COME:

If he withdrew —

12

QUESTION:

For making that kind of agreement and

13 withdrawing.
14

MR. COME:

Yes.

More than that.

The Board in a

15 case called Olympia that we have cited in our brief here has
16 found that in that situation, the association can file an
17 unfair labor practice charge against the union and the
18 offending employer for refusing to bargain, so that I think
19 in terms of these separate agreements, they are not going to
20 be a very freguent occurrence, if at all, in view of the
21 Board's present clarification of the total area, and the
22 only thing that we are left with are the interim agreements
23 which are contingent upon the ultimate association-wide
24 agreement, and we don’t even have that in this case.
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Come, could we decide this case

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 without discussing interim agreements?
2

MR. COME;

And if so, should we

I think that you can decide it without

3 reaching interim agreements.

Judge Campbell, who concurred

4 in the court below, thought that you could do so.

The

5 majority of the Court of Appeals felt that it was necessary
6 to reach the question because the Third Circuit in the Beck
7 case had held that even though there wasn't any interim
8 agreements in that case, the mere possibility of interim
9 agreements required that the court had to address the
10 interim agreement question.
11

From the Board's standpoint, and from the

12 standpoint of the — of the parties engaged in
13 multi-employer bargaining, I think it would be helpful to
14 get the entire area clarified.

However, it is not essential

15 for the Court to decide that question in order to sustain
16 the Board in this case.
17

QUESTION;

But we do have to — we will certainly

18 have to consider what the impact of a selective strike is.
19

MR. COME:

Hell, but I think that Buffalo Linen

20 answered that question.
21

QUESTIONS

No, I said the impact, though, what the

22 consequence is on the employer with respect to the
23 multi-employer bargaining unit.
24

MR. COME*

Well, with Buffalo Linen, the argument

25 that the Second Circuit made in Buffalo Linen, and it was

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2 multi-employer bargaining relationship the union selected
3 one employer as a strike was tantamount to withdrawing from

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Hr. Come, your time has

MR. COME:

9

QUESTION:

Justice O'Connor?

10

QUESTION:

Thank you^

11

Mr. Come,

I would like to ask you something

12 the Hi-Way Billboards case, which indicated that when an
13 impasse is reached, that the parties under those
14 circumstances can take certain action.

The union can call

15 for a strike, the employers can engage in a lockout, the
16 employer could hire replacements, the employer could make
17 unilateral changes in working conditions rejected by the
18 union.
19

Now, in this particular case, all those things

20 except maybe the working conditions, which didn’t appear to
21 be an issue, had been done, and yet the impasse continued.
22 Now, under those circumstances, isn't it reasonable to say
23 that it was an unusual circumstance, after all those other
24 things have been tried, because that is the purpose of

25 letting them be tried?

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. COME*

Well, those are merely examples of some

2 of the things that could be done.

They don’t exhaust the --

3 either the arsenal of the economic weapons that are
4 available to the parties or what could be done to break the
5 impasse.

A mediator, for example, was not brought in, which

6 is often the case,
7 and

and does result in breaking the impasse,

the fact is that an agreement was ultimately reached

8 here in

the — in the multi-employer bargaining unit.
I know my brother would suggest that that was due

9

10 to the withdrawal of Bonanno, but I submit that it is
11 equally

possible that that is not so, because the parties

12 did not prior to Bonanno's leaving the unit, the record
13 shows that there were those within the unit that thought
14 that the way to break the impasse was to increase the wage
15 offer that was being given to the union, and that was what
16 was ultimately one of the ways in which the log jam was
17 broken.

At that point the union withdrew its demand for

18 compensation.

So, it is equally as fair an inference.

I submit that Bonanno's departure retarded the

20 forces that were building up, because it wasn’t until
21 several
22 on
23

more months after he left that they finally got back

the track and worked out a solution to the problem.
The point of it is that the Board leaves insofar

24 as possible to the parties the bargaining process, and
25 doesn’t sit in judgment in the economic weapons that they

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 can use.

As this Court has indicated many times, the use of

2 economic weapons is part and parcel of the system of
3 collective bargaining, and the Board's rule with respect —
4 not regarding impasse as an unusual circumstance, I submit,
5 is consistent with that general philosophy, and also with
6 the practice of collective bargaining as it works in the —
7 in the real world.
8

QUESTION:

Why isn't the withdrawal from a

9 multi-employer bargaining unit an economic weapon which a
10 party may use without the Board's supervision?
11

MR. COME:

Well, if you start with the premise

12 which we submit Congress declared, that there is a positive
13 value in multi-employer bargaining, insofar as its making
14 for efficient collective bargaining and industrial peace.
15 It follows that you need some rules to govern the conduct of
16 that relationship, because if you can withdraw at will after
17 negotiations have started, the unit becomes a bargaining
18 lever in the negotiations, and experience has shown that
19 that is not conducive to effective and efficienct collective

20 bargaining, because the parties have to know what the
21 dimensions of the unit are before they can determine what
22 offers they have to make, how much strength they have in the
23 unit,
24

and so on.
It is for that or those policy reasons that the

25 Board has formulated the Retail Associates rules and why it

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2 circumstance to —
3

QUESTION;

Mr. Come, is it clear that, bearing in

4

mind the consentual nature of the formation of the

5

multi-employer unit, if at the time the employers agreed to

6

bargain as a group, each of them put in his agreement with

7

the others that should there be a period of three months

8 where no progress is made in negotiations,
9

then each of us

shall have the right to withdraw and bargain separately, and

10

that was made known to the union, there would be nothing

11

wrong with that, would there?

I don’t see anything wrong with it.

They can be, yes.

Nell, are they?

19

MR. COME;

Yes.

20

QUESTION;

Well, in that event, you wouldn't think

that the agreements would hold, would they, upon withdrawal?
MR. COME;

In that case, such a limited agreement

might run into conflict with —

No, it was not certified.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES T. GRADY, ESQ.,

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. GRADY;

14

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

15

the Court, if I might, I would like to just trace these

16

facts, because they seem to be running together.

17

union struck Bonanno on June 23rd, 1975, the -- immediately

18

the remaining employers locked out in support of Bonanno,

19

locked out their employees, so that what started for one day

20

as Bonanno only strike, the second day of the strike became

21

all nine employers, including -- in addition to Bonanno,

When the

22 there was a strike, so the multi-employer strike was taking
23

place.

24

that these other employers locked out their employees.

25

It wasn’t Bonanno.

It was in support of Bonanno

They — the parties continued to meet during the

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 summer of 1975, and the strike went on.

Some of the

2 employers were able to hire replacements, some were not.
3 Some’s business, I am sure, was adversely impacted as a
4 result of the strike.
5

The only thing that happened on -- between June

6 23rd, when the strike started, and November 21st, when
7 Bonanno sent his letter to the association effectively
8 withdrawing, the only thing that happened that is in the
9 record is that he successfully had replaced all his struck
10 employees with non-union or at~least non-Teamster employees,
11 so he was effectively running a non-union shop, and had
12 effectively beaten the strike.

That is, he had beaten the

13 Teamster’s union and was now non-union.
14

At this juncture, at this point it was no longer

15 to his interest, economic interest to continue in this
16 multi-employer situation, so he just withdrew, leaving those
17 employers who had come,

in effect, to his rescue, out on —

18 with their employees out on the street.
19 They immediately ended

20

QUESTIONS

What did they do?

the strike.

They were free to do just what he did,

21 though, were they not?
22

MR. GRADYs

No, Your Honor.

The multi-employer

23 negotiations were continued, continuing, so they could —
24 they could lift their lockout at any time they saw fit.
25 they did.

Negotiations continued from November until

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

So

1 April
2

QUESTION;

Having locked out, what was to prevent

3 them from hiring on the open market?
4

MR. GRADY;

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. GRADY;

7

QUESTION;

They could have, Your Honor.
Hell, that was my first question.
I am sorry, Your Honor.

Yes

Precisely what — will you pinpoint

8 precisely what is the reason why that is an impermissible
9 economic weapon on the part of an employer who withdraws?

I

10 am speaking now of this Petitioner.
11

MR. GRADY;

Well, precisely. Your Honor, it just

12 weakens the whole fabric of multi-employer bargaining.

The

13 glue that keeps multi-employer bargaining together from the
14 union point of view is the realization that down the end of
15 the road when we finally reach an agreement all the
16 employers in this association are going to be bound by the
17 terms and conditions of that collective bargaining agreement.
18

QUESTION;

Then my next question would be, do you

19 agree with Mr. Come's response to, I believe, Mr. Justice
20 Stevens that employers going into a multi unit could
21 condition it that 90 days after the negotiations had been
22 going, if no result was achieved, they would be able to
23 withdraw?
24

MR. GRADY;

I believe he also — Justice Stevens

25 indicated that there would be notice to the union of this

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 condition

In my opinion, the union would not participate

2 in such negotiations, because it would be
3 counterproductive.

What happens in this — in the situation

4 of an impasse alone —
5

QUESTION;

I mean, that they must get an

6 agreement, and they couldn’t get such an agreement from a
7 union.
8

MB. GRADY;

We would say that conditioning the

9 bargaining with such a condition precedent as a term to
10 commence negotiations, we would say would be improper and
11 unrealistic, because what happens, if I may further answer
12 your question, whan these -- when we find that the
13 negotiations, if an employer can withdraw, as the Petitioner
14 would have it, we would then have to follow that employer
15 and have individual negotiations with that employer, and
16 then the next one goes, individual negotiations.
17

Our resources are limited.

18 business agents.

We have only so many

Instead of having one set of negotiations

19 for nine employers,

we would have nine separate sets of

20 negotiations being carried on simultaneously, with the
21 possible result of uneven terms and conditions being
22 negotiated.

As this Court well knows, we have a duty of

23 fair representation.
24 than Employer B,

So if Employer A has different terms

and the employees are doing the exact same

25 work, we will get — organizationally it would be a matter

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of great concern to us.
2

QUESTION;

Your response suggests that there may

3 be some right on the part of the union to multi-party
4 bargaining units.
5

MR. GRADY;

6 Honor.

It is a consentual matter, Your

We don't have to accept it.

If the employers wish

7 it and we agree with it, then — and everyone is voluntarily
8 getting into it, just as Bonanno did in this case, right at
9 the outset — he volunteered in February — but we say, once
10 you are in, and the Board says^ you've got to conform to the
11

rules, and the rules are, you don't quit in the middle of

12 negotiations.
13

Call it impasse if you will, but impasse is a

14 common factor.

In fact, the statute contemplates 30 days

15 before the end of the agreement you must notify Federal
16 mediation conciliation.
17 mediator comes in,

Well, in practice, before the

you are already at odds.

You have said,

18 well, I guess we are not going anywhere, let's get the
19 mediator in

here and see if he can.

Now, technically, that

20 is an impasse.
21

QUESTION*

You say those are the rules, but if I

22 understand Mr. Come's explanation of the law, the law is
23 that the parties can make any rules they want to, if
24 everybody agrees.
25

MR. GRADY*

It is consentual, right.

And we would

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 say in the Bonanno situation, the rules are what the Board
2 law was in effect at the time Bonanno started, and the rules
3 at that time, as they are now, were, and are, that you can't
4 draw solely because of impasse, and I think. Justice — Judge
5 Campbell in his concurring opinion was quite accurate in
6 this —
7

QUESTION;

8

MR. GRADY;

Or because of a strike.
Right, strikes are, unfortunately,

9 also part of negotiations, just like impasses.

It is the

10 use of economic strength by the lockout and the strike.
11 They are to be expected in negotiations in the private
12 sector.

Judge Campbell said that it was not necessary to

13 address this whole question of interim agreements.
14 this interesting but nonessential matter.
15 interim agreements in this case.

He says,

There was no

An attempt to raise

16 meetings to negotiations and to an interim agreement, it is
17 just not there.

It is not in the record.

18 interim agreements.

There were no

This is strictly an employer, when he

19 saw the appropriate opportunity for him

withdrawing from the

20 association, abandoning his fellow employers, as it were,
21 and the important thing is, we did reach a contract with the
22 remaining employers in April, and the reason we reached it,
23 in almost a year of negotiations, and what some would
24 describe during an impasse period, is, the union gave up its
25 demand for commissions.

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

Well, at the very first formal

2 negotiations session, don't you have what is in effect an
3 impasse?
4

HR. GRADY;

Ho, because the parties -- usually at

5 the first session the ground rules are developed, and the
6 first proposals are exchanged.

Then the issues are

7 narrowed, and typically the parties will say, all right, we
8 can agree on this clause, we can agree on that, what is
9 left?

And then you go over -- and then you make moves.

You

10 may increase — or the union side would reduce its wage
11

proposal, the employer may increase its wage offer, so you

12 may be —
13

QUESTION;

Well, at what point do you know you

14 have an impasse?
15

HR. GRADY;

I would say a genuine impasse is when

16 there are no meetings scheduled and no plans to discuss
17 anything any further, in my opinion.
18

QUESTION;

Is there anything to prevent the union

19 from singling out one employer and negotiating with him
20 privately?
21

HR. GRADY;

Well, if we did that, we would again

22 get back to the question whether it would be an interim
23 agreement or not.

The Board says, if it is an interim

24 agreement and subject to being modified and solely dependent
25 on what the ultimate association

agreement is, that is

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 permissible.

If, on the other hand, it is an absolute

2 agreement, regardless of what ultimate contract is reached
3 with the association, then the Board seems to be saying that
4 that is improper, and if you have enough of them,
5 particularly if you have — then it is disruptive of the
6 entire association, because it is inconsistent with having
7 an association —
8

QUESTION:

Do you mean, and therefore an unfair

9 labor practice?
10

MB. GBADY:

11

QUESTION:

I wouldn~*t characterize it -Well, it is not an interim agreement.

12 They arrive at a separate one which they regard as final.
13 What is the consequence for the employer in terms of unfair
14 labor practice?
15

MB. GBADY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MB. GBADY:

I don't see any.
Then he is home free, is he?
It is just broken up.

The parties are

18 back to Square One again, individual negotiations will take
19 over from there.

20

QUESTION:

I see.

You mean that automatically

21 breaks up the multi unit?
22

MB. GBADY:

23 Your Honor.

I don't think the law is that clear,

I think one agreement wouldn't do it, but if

24 you had — half your employers had signed solid agreements
25 that are not subject to change, then it seems to me you

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 don't have an association any more.
2

QUESTION*

It is gone.

But under that view, then the union is

3 free any time it wants to to make a separate agreement with
4 an individual employer.
5

MR. GRADY:

I think they do so.

There is another

6 issue that has not been raised that I am cognizant of, and
7 that is some possible restraint of trade considerations with
8 an interim agreement.
9

QUESTION:

Well, forget the antitrust, but just as

10 a matter of your view of the Labor Act, a union is free to
11 make a binding, long-term agreement with one member of the
12 multi-employer unit any time it wants to?
13

MR. GRADY:

It wouldn't be long-term, Your Honor.

14 It would say by its terms, the preamble would say, this
15 agreement is an interim agreement, subject —
16

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

Putting interim agreements

17 to one side.
18

MR. GRADY:

19

QUESTION*

Oh, okay.
As I understand your view of the law,

20 it would not be an unfair labor practice for the union to
21 enter into a binding, long-term agreement with one member of
22 the bargaining unit.
23

MR. GRADY:

I would prefer to have the consent of

24 the remaining employers.
25

QUESTION:

But if you didn't get it.

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

I understand you would prefer that, but

2 it would not violate any rule that you know of for the union
3 to do that.
4

MR. GRADYs

I would -- if we did that, it would

5 not violate the law, but I would anticipate that it is the
6 end of multi-employer bargaining.
7

QUESTION:

The Board doesn't agree with you, does

8 it?
9

HR. GRADYs

The Board has yet to define how many

10 of those let’s call them solid-agreements add up to
11 breakup —
12

QUESTION:

I thought the Board in its brief here

13 -- I thought the Board in its brief here had said that they
14 only recognized interim agreements pending the execution of
15 the unit-wide contract.
16

MR. GRADY:

The case that they cite, I believe,

17 was consentual in terms of the remaining employers.

They

18 didn * t —
19

QUESTION:

Hell, it may be that they haven't got

20 any case, but they certainly say that is their position now.
21

MR. GRADYs

22

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.
Doesn't that give the union an economic

23 weapon here that you suggest is denied,

the counterpart of

24 which is denied to the employer?

25

MR. GRADYs

I don’t see that at all. Your Honor.

48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 It is all consentual to start off with, so that if the
2 parties want to have multi-employer bargaining, they can
3 have it.

If they want to end it, they may do it.

4 interim is not ending it.

The

Clearly, just walking out on

5 impasse is improper, and that is what we are here for, and
6 that is the only issue before this Court.
