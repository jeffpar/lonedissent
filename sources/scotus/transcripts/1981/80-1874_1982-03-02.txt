ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SIMS«

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The issue in this case is whether plaintiffs

11

in 1983 actions can generally be required to exhaust

12

administrative remedies, despite this Court's consistent

13

and repeated holdings that such exhaustion is not

14

required, despite clear congressional recognition of and

15

reliance on those holdings, and despite the absence of

16

any historical basis to support a change in this Court's

17

longstanding construction of Section 1983.

18

Unlike most cases that come before the Court,

19

this case pronounced not a new issue, but an old,

20

previously settled one and respondents have not come

21

near to making the sort of showing required to justify a

22

change in settled statutory construction.

The case is here more than three years after

-- Congress itself had required resort to administrative

7

Four important points stand out from the

8

legislation history of 1997e, and from its design.

9

First, the legislative history makes absolutely clear

10

that Congress knew the non-exhaustion rule was settled

11

law.

12

Representative Kastenmeier said that the statute was

13

necessary to permit — that was his word — exhaustion

14

which was not allowed under current law.

15

Conference Report used similar language.

Sponsors repeatedly called it settled law.

And the

16

Representative Wiggins, one of the Republic

17

sponsors of the bill, indicated that some in Congress

18

would have preferred a broader rule, but he acknowledged

19

the impossibility of mustering a majority in Congress to

20

do so .

21

Second, Congress was not just looking at a

22

small portion of a problem without attention to 1983

23

generally.

24

federal courts was a major focus of congressional

25

concern.

The general problem of 1983 filings in

Congress knew that prison filings which this

1

Court had held and were wording, were subject to the

2

same standards as all other 1983 cases under current law

3

with the largest, single category of 1983 cases

4

burdening the federal courts, and by far the most

5

burdensome because of their generally pro se nature.

6

Aware of that entire problem, Congress decided to deal

7

with it piecemeal, one step at a time, by attacking its

8

major source.

9

Third, Congress was extremely and deliberately

10

selective.

It did not require exhaustion for all 1983

11

cases, or even for all 1983 cases that generally fell

12

within the purview of the Civil Rights for

13

14

15

particular institutions which had adopted particular

16

17

to exhaustion.

people, I am sure, are well advised to go through their

14

people do not do that.

18

And we think

A few words about the legislative history.

19

Read against the background of this Court's cases, we

20

think that 1997e is controlling because even if the

21

court got 1983 completely wrong in McNeese, the fact is

22

that Congress has relied on it.

23

As the court said in similar circumstances in

24

Cannon against University of Chicago, when Congress acts

25

in reliance on one of this court's statutory

Respondents argue only that the 42nd Congress
could not have said anything on the matter one way or

the other because in their view, there was no law

11

concerning exhaustion in the federal courts as of 1871.

12

Their argument misconceives both the state of the law in

13

1871 and the principal themes of the legislative debate.

14

First, the notion of exhaustion was not

15

unknown to the 42nd Congress.

16

Congress passed 1983 in United States against Clyde,

17

this Court had held that federal courts were without any

18

power to require exhaustion unless Congress had

19

expressly done so.

20

The very year that

Second, as to the debates themselves, not only

If you sued the members of the

MR. SIMS:

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FRANKS:

may it please the Court:
We are here asking this Court to affirm the

decision of the Fifth Circuit below and its adoption of

QUESTION;

What significance does the act of

10

Congress have, giving limited exhaustion requirement for

11

persons in institutions, wh-ich was passed recently?

12

NR. FRANKS;

I think that that was a

13

recognition of Congress that the courts needed some

14

assistance in providing for a means of addressing those

15

grievances —

16

QUESTION;

Is it some indication, in your

17

view, that at least Congress thought there was not an

18

administrative exhaustion requirement which the courts

19

had imposed?

20

MR. FRANKS;

No.

To the contrary, I think it

21

is an indication or a possible indication of Congress's

22

reliance on the plain language of the statute that

23

provides for other proper proceedings.

24

they provided for them statutorily.

25

recognize that there is the deferral to the states.

In this case,

But at least they
And

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I think there is an indication there of their desire to

2

require exhaustion in these circumstances and to provide

3

a mechanism by which the courts — I mean, the states,

4

and the agencies that are concerned to address those

5

particular problems.
I do not see it as being dispositive or the

6

7

final word that only Congress can address the

8

non-exhaustion rule.

9

substantial support for the ironclad no exhaustion rule.
QUESTIONS

10

I do not feel that that is

Do you think there is an 11th

11

amendment problem in this case?

12

MR. FRANKS:

Yes.

It was raised below in the

13

district court, it was not addressed by the district

14

court, it was not addressed in the Fifth Circuit, and

15

the case was not briefed here.

16

responded to was — on the certiorari — as to whether

17

or not the exhaustion rule should be reversed.

The issue that we

But yes, there is an 11th amendment issue.

18
19

However, we feel that this particular issue of

20

exhaustion transcends the Patsy case and the state of

21

Florida, and is one that should be addressed by this

22

Court.

23

And it does not — the adoption of a flexible

24

exhaustion remedy does not require the overruling of

25

prior decisions.

I will not bore you with a recitation

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of those, but they are outlined in both the amicus brief

2

that we filed — or that was filed on behalf of

3

respondent, as well as an analysis of the case law and

4

the opinions of this Court and the Fifth Circuit below.

5

And to respond to Justice Blackmun’s question

6

as to why the members of the original panel may have

7

reversed themselves, I would suggest that a possible

8

reason is that there was an opportunity for them to be

9

persuaded that exhaustion or no exhaustion is not

10

required, and it is not an ironclad rule.

And that by

11

analyzing the previous decisions of this case, you can

12

come to the conclusion that exhaustion may be a

3

procedural rule that can be adopted by this Court and is

4

consistent with the plain language of the statute itself.

actions
MR. FRANKS:

It was summary action that was

argued en banc.
This Court has stated that you only retreat or

5

displace 1983 for compelling, persuasive reasons.

Some

6

of the things that the flexible exhaustion rule has

7

annunciated below does — first of all, it does permit

8

the court to determine how it is to exercise the

9

jurisdiction given to it by Congress.

It exercises its

10

Article III analysis to determine whether or not it is

11

ripe for adjudication or whether the case is complete as

12

far as an injury is concerned.

13

QUESTION*

On this question of ripeness, could

14

you tell me in your view when does the statute of

15

limitations start to run for the 1983 client?

16

NR. FRANKS:

Florida has a variable statute of

17

limitations, but for back, pay and termination and so on,

18

the general statute of limitations is two years.

19

21

QUESTION*

And does it begin to run before or

after the exhaustion process takes place?
MR. FRANKS*

the rationale of Tomanio, that the -- if exhaustion is

required as a jurisdictional prerequisite, that it would

toll the statute of limitations —

I do not know that you need to do

would — we are not talking about two separate

proceedings running concurrently along; we are talking

about an action that may originally go to the district

You made a reference to ripeness,

and I just --

4

MR. FRANKS:

It helps determine whether or not

5

the case is ripe for adjudication, is my point on that.

6

In that way, it assists in the --

7

QUESTION:

Well, ripeness would mean, I take

8

it, that if the case is not ripe because something had

9

not been completed, then there would be no way into the

10

federal court under 1983 until the case became ripe.

11

Isn't that what ripeness means?

12

MR. FRANKS:

In this case, for example, it may

13

very well be that there has been no final state action

14

by the Board of Regents which would trigger a 1983

15

action.

16

QUESTION:

Is that what you mean by ripeness?

17

MR. FRANKS:

Well, that is one of the ways in

18

which flexible exhaustion would help the court determine

19

whether or not an issue is ripe, is whether or not there

20

has been a completed action which would indicate that

21

there has either been a denial of due process or denial

22

of equal protection or other constitutional right which

23

has been violated.

Well, what would happen to the

petitioner in this case if instead of going into the

If everyone had done nothing after

I think it is as consistent with the plain language in

22

interpretation of that particular phrase of 1983, and it

23

is an indication, along with numerous others on the part

of Congress, to defer to the states and to give the

25

states the opportunity to correct any wrongs that may

We have come a long way since 1871.

Times

have changed to the point where Congress, I think, is

3

recognizing, along with the-Administration, that states

can and should handle these matters.

5

provides for other proper proceedings.

6

courts are supplementary to those remedies that are

7

available in the states, whether they are administrative

that they are predominant.

10

addressed in the context of federalism, then they should

11

be done so.

12

One other point on 1997.

I indicated that

13

this was a response to the crisis that Congress

14

perceived, and as I indicated, it does permit the

15

deferral of action to the states.

16

case below, there is certainly no displacement of 1983.

17

It is a deferral, and it does permit administrative

18

agencies to address those.

19

And as noted by the

I indicated that it does not require

20

overruling prior decisions, and I think that the

21

commentaries in Chicago and Harvard Law Review articles

22

that we have cited in our brief are indications of how

23

the Fifth Circuit reached the result that they did below.

24
25

And finally, this requiring the exhaustion of
administrative remedies and basing it upon the plain

the other compelling persuasive reasons I have listed

provides for speedy relief.

Clark, in 55 South Cal Law Review, has done a

5

statistical analysis of the decisions of the federal

6

courts in the 20th century, and it turns out that the

average case, including all of those that are dismissed,

is settled in 1.16 years.

I do not believe that it can.

Doesn't he have the right to ask

MR. FRANKS:

Oh, that is correct, yes, sir.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES S. SIMS, ESQ.

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - Rebuttal

3

MR. SIMSi

A brief point on the 11th amendment

4

point that has concerned some members of the Court.

5

would agree with my colleague that the question would

6

probably be open on remand.

7

exhaustion is not permitted, the case then goes back

8

down to the district court for further proceedings, and

9

they have raised the question already, and it could at

10
11

I

And if this Court hold that

that point be decided by the district court.
Because-there are some particular aspects

12

about the way this case is framed — that is, this Board

13

of Regents is a body corporate rather than a state

14

agency, and in addition, the fact that it may stand in

15

the same position as the universities or boards in

16

Delaware State College versus Ricks, Tomanio case, the

17

Horrowitz case, the Roth case, Bacci case and others. I

18

would think that since that question has not been raised

19

here, and a judgment need not be -- a final judgment

20

entered against the state here -- that the Court could

21

decide the exhaustion question before it and leave the

22

11th amendment question for the lower court to address.

23

In addition, with regard to damages, there is

24

a recent decision of the Fifth Circuit, or the Eleventh

25

Circuit, at 666 Fed 2d, 505, that bears on the question

1

of whether the particular finances of this university.

2

the fact that they have extensive funds which are not

3

derived from the state or required to be kept in a state

4

treasury, unlike their other funds, is relevant.

the Eleventh Circuit suggested that that was —

MR. SIMS:

QUESTION:

And the 11th amendment would not be

a bar to your prayer for —*
MR. SIMS:

We are seeking on the merits

equitable relief and damages, that is correct.

10
11

As I understand it, you are

requesting some equitable relief, aren't you?

8

And

Under Korn versus Jordan I would

not think so, Your Honor.
With regard to the other points raised, I

14
15

think they were all policy questions, and as we have

16

indicated, we think those are for Congress, not for the

17

courts.

Unless there are further questions?
