ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRED M. GOLDBERG, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. GOLDBERG;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This matter is before the Court this morning on a

11

writ of certiorari of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky.

12

issues raised involve issues of First Amendment rights of

13

political speech, and specifically whether this speech has

14

been infracted by Kentucky Revised Statute, which I may

15

refer to as KRS,

16

statutory appendix to the brief on the merits at page 11.

17

121055.

The

The Court will find that in the

That statute has been interpreted, in our opinion,

18

in such manner as to encroach upon the Petitioner's rights

19

under the First Amendment.

20

Court this morning will be vagueness and overbreadth, will

21

be the creation of artificial distinctions based on content

The specific issues before the

22 or speaker, and the threshold issue of clear and present
23

danger and whether that doctrine was applied by the courts

24

of Kentucky appropriately in this case or at all indeed.

25

As applied in the facts at bar, this case or this

statute would prohibit a candidate from promising in an

2

election campaign the pro tanto reduction of taxes.

3

Generally speaking, the proceedings below were that the

4

trial court found that the statute had been violated, but on

5

interesting findings which I will discuss with the Court in

6

a minute found that the election should not be voided.

7

the contrary, he found that the Petitioner here was fairly

8

elected.

9

To

The matter was appealed to the Court of Appeals of

10

Kentucky, and it found a violation of the statute as

11

interpreted and found that the statute should be strictly

12

applied and the election voided.

14

Appeals of Kentucky — and the Court of Appeals of Kentucky

is now our intermediate appellate court.

16

cases will have come from the Court of Appeals of Kentucky,

17

and at another point the case will come from the Supreme

18

Court of Kentucky.

At some points the

The Court of Appeals on its petition for rehearing
then reconsidered, found that the statute was still

22 violated, but on the other hand expressed some reservation
23

in regard to the constitutionality and the overbreadth of

24

the statute, and nonetheless overruled the lower court.

25

A petition was then filed or motion for

discretionary review to the Supreme Court of Kentucky, our

2

now highest appellate court, and that was summarily

3

overruled.

the following facts.

This Court granted certiorari and we're here on

Carl Brown, the Petitioner in this matter, sought

5

6

the office of county commissioner of Jefferson County,

7

Kentucky.

Jefferson County, Kentucky contains the only city

8 of the first class in Kentucky, and in that regard in the
9

Joint Appendix you will find some statutes that refers to

10

city of the first class.

11

Kentucky, if the Court will.

12

That is only in Jefferson County,

But in any event, Carl Brown sought a seat on the

13

Fiscal Court, which is our legislative body which along with

14

the county judge executive forms the executive branch of

15

government of the county, although it has legislative

16

functions as well, pass ordinances, et cetera.

17

This was in the election of 1979.

Brown and a Dr.

18

Bill Creech were running mates on a joint platform as the

19

Republican candidates and ran against the Respondent, Earl

20

Hartlage, as the Democratic incumbent.

21

Now, the Petitioner and Creech campaigned on

22 issues of governmental economy and the usual issues that one
23

would expect of an election of that nature.

Specifically,

24

they zeroed in on some of Hartlage's spending and primarily

25

in at least one press release that is available to you-all

16

research and found that certainly someone had articulated an

17

arguable question under the law of Kentucky, that there were

illegal promise, that it is inconceivable that his election

could have been voided.

day of August 1979, four days after the comment was made.

23

Brown and Creech in a joint press conference, which received

24

the same publicity and the same coverage as the original

25

statement, retracted that statement.

They acknowledged that

Pardon me, please.

20

The matter was tried in a bench trial on January

21

29th and 30th, 1980, and the evidence, among the rest of the

22 evidence appears a stipulation by the Petitioner and by the

23 Respondent that the retraction received as broad a coverage
24 publicity-wise as the original statement.
25

The trial court then rendered its decision and

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021.554-2345

1

found that there was a technical, if you will — and that's

2

my own characterization — a technical violation of KRS

3

121055, the statute which prohibited the promise to the

4

electorate, but that the election was fair.

5

judge found as a fact in his determination of the fairness

6

of the election, he found five elements.

And the trial

He found that there was an almost immediate

retraction.

He found that there was no retreat from the

10

election, and commented even though Mr. Brown had been

11

challenged by Mr. Hartlage at some political conclave, Brown

12

remained adamant in his retraction and did not deviate from

13

that.
The judge balanced the disenfranchisement of

14
15

thousands of voters, as he put it, and the presumption of

16

the will of the people and Creech’s defeat, and found that

17

the election was fair and that Brown should receive his

18

office.

19

Now, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in its

20 original opinion rendered August the 8th,

1980 followed an

21

old decision in Kentucky that harks back to 1960, Sparks

22

against Boggs.

23

And it may be appropriate for me to digress for a

24

moment and advise the Court as to the ramifications of

25

Sparks against Boggs and a prior opinion that harks to 1925,

8

1

Owsley against Hill.

These two cases, in my judgment, are

2

probably interpretive of some phases of the statute and

3

require some comment.

salary was a legal possibility in the context of the fact

12

that it had not been set, and also said in its opinion that

13

that sort.

It was not a commitment to the entire electorate

2

bat to a select group in the electorate.
The Court of Appeals of Kentucky in that case

3
4

distinguished Owsley -- again, that was our highest court at

5

the time — distinguished Owsley and in effect said that the

6

promise to serve for less was a bribe and as such should be

7

barred.
Now, in that light we find that the Court of

8
9

Appeals of Kentucky in the Carl Brown case, the case before

10

you this morning, in the Carl Brown case held that Brown

11

could not legally do the act, he could not legally reduce

12

his salary; and in that regard there was no exception in the

13

statute for a retraction; in that regard that the other

14

considerations of the trial court were inapplicable and not

15

to be considered; and that the statement was not

16

constitutionally protected under the aegis of the

17

Constitution of the United States.

18

Now, on the —

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. GOLDBERG;

21

QUESTION;

Hr. Goldberg?
Yes, ma’am.

Do you interpret these cases in the law

22 of Kentucky to provide then that the statute forbids only
23

campaign promises to perform illegal acts?
MR. GOLDBERG;

24
25

yes.

Justice O'Connor, I perceive --

My answer to your question would be yes.

However, the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

problem will arise in a moment in my argument as to how in

2

the world we determine what's illegal or legal.

3

perceive that interpretively speaking the statute prohibits

4

illegal acts —

5

QUESTIONS

6

MR. GOLDBERG:

But I

Promising to do an illegal act.
A promise to do an illegal act, or

7

perhaps better stated, if I may, an act incapable of legal

8

accomplishment.

9

sort of fuzzy in my mind, I must tell you; but I think

10
11
12

13

There is some nuance of difference that's

that's what it says.
Now, in that regard then -- I'm sorry.

Did that

answer your question?
QUESTION;

Yes.

Do you take the position that

14

what was stated by the candidates in this case was something

15

that was not capable of legal accomplishment then?

16

MR. GOLDBERG;

I do not necessarily take that

17

position, but I think that I would have to take that

18

position for the purposes of this case.

19

QUESTION;

Okay.

20

MR. GOLDBERG;

Now, on the petition for rehearing

21

rendered on October 29th, 1980, the Court of Appeals of

22

Kentucky perceived that the Petitioner's position was not

23

without logic or appeal, but suggested that if you want the

24

relief that you request of us, we perceive your argument to

25

be that one of overbreadth on a federal constitutional

11

basis.

2

Appeals — Supreme Court of Kentucky and they are the court

3

that can grant you the relief that you seek.

4

judicial anarchy for us to overrule Sparks against Boggs.

5

But if you want that relief, go to the Court of

It would be

Now, on that state of facts obviously we

6

petitioned the Supreme Court of Kentucky, and we were

7

summarily turned down.

8
9

This Court has granted us the writ.

Now, at the outset of argument I would suggest to
the Court that I concede that the Commonwealth of Kentucky

10

has an interest in the electoral process.

11

foolish for me to say otherwise.

12

that that is not an uninhibited interest, that is not

13

uninhibited as to political speech particularly, but that

14

that interest must be balanced against the intrusions on the

15

First Amendment right.

16

It would be

However, I argue and urge

I don't think that your amicus or I disagree that

17

this was political speech.

18

is where the interpreted statute impacts the rights of Carl

19

Brown and where it crosses the bounds of propriety

20

circumscribed around the First Amendment by this Court.

21

QUESTION;

The problem that we disagree on

Mr. Goldberg, do you think that under

22

Kentucky law a campaign promise to try to cut government

23

expenditures and reduce taxes would be legal or illegal?

24
25

MR. GOLDBERG;

I'm inclined that the promise to

cut taxes would be illegal, and that's part of the vagueness

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202).554-2345

1

argument, Justice O'Connor; and it runs something like

2

this.

3

prohibit the making of a promise that would inure to the

4

benefit of all the public and it is incapable of being

5

legally performed, I'd suggest to you that a candidate for

6

any office — in the Senate, in the legislature, or in the

7

executive branch of government — couldn't make that promise.
The vagueness is inherent in the fact that no

8
9

If we posit that the Owsley and Sparks decision

single member of any body of government without the

10

cooperation of a majority of his house or a majority of his

11

group and without the imprimatur of the chief executive can

12

ever make such a promise.

13

that situation.
QUESTION:

14

So I have a difficult time with

What would be the situation, counsel,

15

if he carefully phrased his remarks to say if elected I will

16

advocate a program of reduction of salaries generally?
MR. GOLDBERG:

17

Mr. Chief Justice, I think that the

18

question or the problem presented by the phrasing of the

19

hypothetical "if" prior may defeat the whole impact of what

20

I perceive the First Amendment to award.

21

advocacy situation»

This is an

It is projected in a political arena.

22 I don’t feel that the First Amendment or this Court has ever
23

required that a man use the precision of words in political

24

speech that would require him to wonder should I say this or

25

not .
L..
13

1

To do that, Mr. Chief Justice, in my judgment

2

would make my awful antsy if I were a candidate, because it

3

would chill my speech.

It would remove my thought processes

4 from my head, and in the last analysis the interchange of
5

ideas, sir, is the fundamental of the First Amendment.
QUESTION;

6

Well, supposing your candidate is

7 speaking before a group of Little League people and says if
8

elected I'm going to promise to get $5,000 for the Little

9

League that they don't presently have coming out of the

10

county treasury.
Now, I take it that would violate the statute,

11
12

wouldn't it?
MR. GOLDBERG;

13

Sr. Justice Rehnquist, I believe it

14 would.
QUESTION;

MR. GOLDBERG;

All of the people in the

I would agree with that, sir.

I

8

would suggest to you that in Kentucky the presumption of the

9

electorate and the taxpayers, apparently from the Owsley

10

case, are one and the same.
I would point out to the Court or to you, sir,

11
12

that, for instance, a commitment, I shall aid the elderly,

13

14

groups to which politicians appeal,’and in that regard

15

that's the problem I have with this statute in terms of

vagueness.

17

18

promises — I'm not advocating any promise that is not

19

usual, if you will, sir; but on the other hand, I feel that

20

the inhibitive factors of this statute place a pall over

21

political speech, and that’s where I think that it’s vague.

22

There is no means by which a candidate of common

23

intelligence in my judgment can ascertain exactly where do I

24

cross that line.

25

QUESTIONS

5

ME. GOLDBERGt

He felt — pardon me, sir.

And made the retraction.
Yes, sir.

I concede that point.

6

It's evident in the facts.

But I am suggesting to you that

7

he had to go research, as a young lawyer, he had to go

8

research that problem out.

9

Your amicus curiae and I both have argued both sides of the

10

issue in this matter; and it occurs to me that the argument

11

itself, Mr. Justice Rehnquist is dispositive of the

12

vagueness of this statute; that there is no clear line of

And it is not without debate.

13 political speech that Carl Brown could have relied upon.
14

In that regard then with the no notice concept in

15

this statute, we have to look at another concept that these

16 facts give rise to and which have been briefed; and that is
17

that in Kentucky a county commissioner in a county

18 containing a city of the first class has a benchmark salary
19 and he has an escalated salary by what we Kentuckians call
20

the rubber dollar concept to make up for the inflationary

21

action on all salaries.

22

The base salary for a county commissioner in a

23 county containing a city of the first class is found in KRS
24 6530 sub 6, and that appears in the Appendix to the brief,
25 and it sets that benchmark salary at $9,600.

That is the

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202),554-2345

1

legal salary, I don’t know, except that I do know that it is

2

permissible in Kentucky, the Fiscal Court may — it’s

3

written in the permissive — may escalate those salaries up

4

to an administrative sum determined by the State Finance

5

Department.
Now, we get to the very interesting question in my

6
7

judgment.

Carl Brown offered to serve at the time for what

8

amounts to $17,000.

9

applied to his situation or to the office which he sought.

The rubber dollar concept had been

He in effect said I will serve for $17,000, not the $20,000

11

12

impediment ?

Does that create a legal

13

The legal salary, if we are going to saddle Brown

14

with determining that which is legal, then the legal salary

15

would have to be brought down.

16

arise does Brown have a right to give up that which is not

17

part of the legal salary, the $9,600, or does he have a

18

right to give up his rubber dollar theory or his rubber

19

dollars.

The question would then

And there is a prohibition in the rubber dollar

20 statute that reads to the effect that you shall not change
21

your salary or you shouldn’t change your salary during the

that I read Landmark Communication — and I'm not going to

the issue arises.

In that regard it was not used in this

Mr. Chauvin.

12

MR. CHAUVIN;

13

QUESTION;

Yes, ma'am.

The literal language of the statute

14

seems to say that no candidate shall promise to vote for or

15

support any individual, thing or measure.

16

MR. CHAUVIN:

17

QUESTION;

Yes, ma'am.

Does that mean that under Kentucky law

18

a candidate couldn't promise to support some particular

19

proposal for legislative action?

20

MR. CHAUVIN;

Justice O'Connor, under Kentucky law

21

it's my interpretation of the statute that a candidate can

22

promise to do or not do anything which is not illegal or

23

constitutionally forbidden.

24
25

QUESTION;

In this case --

Has any Kentucky case affirmatively

stated that proposition?

MR. CHAUVIN:

QUESTIONS

Yes, ma’am.

Or do we rely only on the two older

cases that were cited?

MR. CHAUVINs

The original case where the salary

The statute

say that a salary may not be scaled up or scaled down during

So that your statute goes to the

impossible as well as to the illegal.

8

MR. CHAUVIN:

9

QUESTIONS

Yes, sir.

There are those who say that President

10

Reagan's promise to balance the budget is impossible.

11

that be a violation of your Kentucky statute?

12

MR. CHAUVIN:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CHAUVIN:

Would

No, sir.

Why not?
No, sir.

I think he said he'd give

15

it his best shot, and at that time the budget was not set.

16

There’s nothing in the Constitution of the United States

17

that says in May of the election year the budget is set, so

18

he would not have crossed the line.
QUESTION:

19

So, of course, none of your decisions

20

have come right out and said that this statute is limited to

22

impossible.

10

Well, if the statute purported to

language of the statute.

13

MR. CHAUVIN:

14

QUESTION;

15
16
17
18

It would go too far.

First Amendment would be regulating.

QUESTION:

ME. CHAUVIN:

5

QUESTION:

Mr. Chauvin.
Yes, ma’am.

Would a promise by a candidate to vote

6

for a reduction in taxes pro tanto be an illegal promise

7

under the Kentucky statute?
MR. CHAUVIN:

8
9

Justice O’Connor, if the rate had

not been set, the candidate could well do that.

The

10

violation in this case is that in August when this statement

11

was made, the action which forbade it had already taken

12

place.
QUESTION:

13
14

No.

Just a blanket promise that if

elected I will vote for a pro tanto reduction in taxes.

15

MR. CHAUVIN:

16

QUESTION:

No, ma’am, that’s not a violation.

Why then does the Kentucky court rely

17

on that in its opinions as a justification for holding it

18

invalid ?

19

MR. CHAUVIN:

I read that in the case, but I did

20

not think of that as an overriding reason the Kentucky court

21

— I think it was one of the reasons, but not the overriding

22

reason that that case held that.

23

QUESTION:

Because if that would not be invalid,

24

then I wonder whether the Kentucky courts have limited the

25

application of the statute as you have suggested.

MR. CHAUVIN;

In the first case the petition was

2

dismissed, the highest court saying there’s nothing wrong

3

with what the candidate said because the salary hadn’t been

4

set.

It was not an impossibility.

Mr. Chauvin, may I ask another

14

this demonstrates he’s not qualified for office; and so

forth and so on?

Why isn't that an adequate remedy instead of
saying he can’t even make the statement in the first place?

No, but the question whether the man

It's seldom you can deal with a statute that says you can do

said, that nothing is proscribed except that which is

illegal and constitutionally impossible.
I think that it is and would urge the Court, as

the lower courts have, that this is a valid assertion by the

state legislature of the interest of the Commonwealth of
