ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. FREEMAN LEVERETT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. LEVERETTs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
The question in this case is whether the Court

10

of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit duly followed this

11

Court's decision in City of Mobile versus Bolden, in

12

holding that the affect of that decision was to still

13

retain the so-called Zimmer criteria of voting dilution

14

as being sufficient to establish an inference rather

15

than simply requiring a presumption.

16

this case respectfully submit that the court of appeals

17

did not follow this Court's decision.

18

The appellants in

This case was filed in 1976 and attacked as an

19

unconstitutional dilution of Black voting rights the

20

at-large method of electing the five county

21

commissioners of Burke County, Georgia,

22

in effect continuously since 1911.

23

which had been

According to the 1970 census, Burke County has

24

a population, or had a population of 18,235, 60.91% of

25

which were Black.

This case was tried subsequent to the

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

court of appeals’

2

holding that while discriminatory purpose must now be

3

shown in a voting dilution case, that it could still be

4

proven by the four discriminatory impact factors which

5

had been identified in Zimmer versus KcKeithen.

6

However, the trial was before this Court’s decision in

7

Mobile holding that the Zimmer criteria were no longer

8

sufficient.

9

1978 decision in Nevett v. Sides,

The trial court below specifically held that

10

the 1911 law had not been enacted with a discriminatory

11

purpose, and that Blacks had not been able to show a

12

denial of specific voting processes.

13

concluded, however, based upon the socio-economic

14

factors of Zimmer which the court of appeals previously

15

had resuscitated in Nevett II that the system, quote,

16

"is being maintained for invidious purposes."

The court

17

Prior to the decision in the court of appeals

18

on the appeal, this Court decided Mobile versus Bolden.

19

Nevertheless, the court of appeals affirmed the district

20

court, concluding that the Zimmer criteria or factors

21

were still sufficient to establish an inference of

22

discriminatory intent, but that the only effect of this

23

Court’s decision in Mobile had been that they were no

24

longer sufficient to establish a presumption.

25

secondly, a finding of responsiveness was now of major

And that

1

consideration in that without a finding of

2

responsiveness, the Court said, there could be no

3

establishment of dilution.

4

upon the fact that in the Zimmer case, there had been no

5

showing of lack of responsiveness.

6

This apparently was based

In this case, the courts below relied upon the

7

same three Zimmer factors which had been found

8

insufficient in Mobile — slating, unresponsiveness and

9

past discrimination.

The added factor relied upon here,

10

which was socio-economic status that had been depressed,

11

was also present in Mobile, although not denominated or

12

articulated as such.

13

In fact, we submit that the evidence in this

14

case was even stronger than it was in Mobile, for here,

15

unlike Mobile, there was no evidence that there had been

16

efforts to change the system, which as pointed out in

17

Justice White's dissent in Mobile, had been done in such

18

a manner as to indicate the possible inference of

19

discrimination by the timetable or the manner in which

20

the attempted repeal was made, as well as the effort to

21

come in and bolster the system by in 1965 conferring

22

executive responsibilities upon the three city

23

commissioners in Mobile.

24
25

Notwithstanding this, the court of appeals
adhered to the socio-economic disparity impact analysis

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of the Zimmer.

In the companion case involving Thomas

2

County, Georgia, the court specifically reversed a

3

holding of the district court which said that Zimmer is

4

no longer sufficient after the Supreme Court's decision

5

in the Mobile case.

6

We submit that the court of appeals erred in

7

its evaluation of this Court's decision in Mobile, and

8

we say that even assuming that the Zimmer analysis is

9

still sufficient to establish purposeful discrimination,

10

that the plaintiffs in this case failed to carry the

11

burden, and the decision below is clearly erroneous.

12

Firstly, we submit that under no reading of

13

this Court’s decision in the Mobile case, can this

14

distinction between presumption versus inference that

15

the court of appeals read into it be sustained.

16

Nevett, which is a 1978 decision, as well as in its

17

companion case of Mobile which later was decided by this

18

Court, the court of appeals below stated the Zimmer test

19

in terms of an inference, and applied it as simply one

20

form of circumstantial evidence subject to the clearly

21

erroneous standard of Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of

22

Civil Procedure.

23

Both in

It is significant I think that the plaintiffs

24

do not make any belated or any great effort to support

25

or to defend the decision of the court of appeals on

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Counsel, you may

con tinue.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. FREEMAN LEVERETT, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS (Resumed)

6

MR. LEVERETT;

7
8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
I think I was simply commenting when we

9

recessed that the decision of the Fifth Circuit in this

10

case was contrary to a decision of another panel of the

11

same court less than a month earlier in the Escambia

12

County, Florida case, and also, it is contrary to a

13

recent decision of the Fourth Circuit which was decided

14

about a month or so ago.

m

15

Now, with respect to the other aspect of the

16
17
18
19
20
21

QUESTION;

Both in the same wing of the —

what was formerly the Fifth Circuit?
MR. LEVERETT;

The Eleventh Circuit, yes, sir,

that is correct.
With respect to the other part of the court's

22

decision on the question of unresponsiveness, the

23

appellants and the appellees are apparently in agreement

24

that the court is in error with respect to that aspect

25

of the holding.

We submit further, on behalf of the

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

appellants, that while the matter of unresponsiveness

2

was mentioned in White versus Regester without any

3

discussion as to whether it was a proper subject for

4

judicial resolution, that consideration of that type of

5

inquiry should be precluded by the political question

6

doctrine.

7

Justice Harlan stated it better than anyone in

8

Whitcomb versus Chavis.

9

subjects for federal judicial inquiry, they do not

If there are less appropriate

readily come to mind.
Now, White versus Regester itself does contain

12

the discriminatory intent requirement.

Zimmer, however.

13

does not, and in footnote 16 of that decision, the Fifth

14

Circuit stated unequivocally that the focus of the

15

inquiry should be on the effect or impact of the

16

legislation being challenged.

»

17

As applied to Burke County, Georgia, we submit

18

that since the court below found that the at-large

19

system was not enacted for a discriminatory purpose,

20

that there is no basis for striking it down in this case

21

without at the same time recognizing some constitutional

22

basis of at least some degree of proportionate

23

representation.

24

touchstone of dilution seems to be access.

25

here is that in Burke County Elacks have never had any

This is so, we submit, because the

Certainly, since the white primary was stricken

QUESTION:

Mr. Leverett, do you agree or don't

10

you that the court of appeals interpreted the district

11

court's action as having found intentional

12

discrimination.

13

MR. LEVERETT:

14

QUESTION:

Yes, sir, by doing this —

*
But they concluded that the

15

district court’s findings should be read as finding

16

intentional discrimination.

17

MR. LEVERETT:

That is correct, but by relying

18

on the same Zimmer analysis which we submit this Court

19

had held was not sufficient to do that in City of Mobile

20

versus Bolden.

21

QUESTION:

But if we -- but assume that we

22

were — assume the court of appeals was correct that the

23

district court findings overall should be read as

24

finding discriminatory intent, and the court of appeals

25

agreed with that.

HR. LEVERETT;

Kell, if you assume that,

you've assumed the case, it would seem to me.
QUESTION;

Well, no, I suppose we could still

say that both were clearly erroneous.
HR. LEVERETT;

That is the point.

We are

making that point, too, Justice White.
QUESTION;

I know you are, I know you are.

8

But is that the only issue, that two courts below found

9

intentional discrimination and that that finding was

10
11

clearly erroneous?

Is that the point?

MR. LEVERETT;

No, sir.

The basic question

12

that we are making here is that the process by which the

13

court found discriminatory intent is fallacious because

14

it is a continuation of the Zimmer criteria which this

15

Court said were impact-type only and did not establish

16

discriminatory purpose or intent.

17

QUESTION;

Well, do you agree — however the

18

district court arrived at it, do you agree that it found

19

intentional discrimination?

20
21

22

MR. LEVERETT;

Yes, sir.

According to the

language of the opinion, it —
QUESTION;

Then how can we disagree with that,

23

especially if it's been accepted by the court of appeals

24

without finding it is clearly erroneous?

25

that it's because they had an erroneous rule of law.

Do you say

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

ME. LEVERETT;

1

They applied an erroneous legal

2

standard.

We say that even assuming, in this case, that

3

the Zimmer criteria are still valid, assuming that

4

Mobile had not even been decided, that in this case the

5

plaintiffs did not carry the burden and that the finding

6

QUESTION;

7

But would you agree that the thrust

8

of Judge Henderson's dissent was that it should go back

9

because they had not given appropriate weight to the

10

Mobile holding?
MR. IEVERETT;

11

Yes, sir.

I might say that the

12

Fourth Circuit's decision in Washington versus Findley

13

that just came down deals with this question and said

14

that there was no need to send it back because in that

15

case, at the time the case was tried, the Washington v.

16

Davis had been decided, the parties were on notice that

17

discriminatory intent was necessary and therefore,

18

having not shown it, the case should be dismissed and

19

judgment entered for the defendants.
QUESTION;

20

Mr. Leverett, do you agree that the

21

district court can properly look at circumstantial

22

evidence in meeting the Mobile --

23

MR. LEVERETT;

Oh, sure, sure.

I think the

24

proper approach is set forth in this Court's opinion in

25

Arlington.

The four or five factors, the sequence of

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

events, whether what was done represented a substantial

2

departure procedurally-wise, or substantive-wise.

3

think the proper application of that is well illustrated

4

by the decision of the Fifth Circuit itself in the

5

Escambia County cases where the court considered that at

6

the time Escambia County adopted at-large voting, it

7

went to it right after there had been -- the white

8

primary had been stricken down and there was some

9

arguments made in the newspapers along racial lines.

10

That is the type of proper inquiry that we submit is

11

appropriate in the light of this Court's decision in

12

Mobile.

13

QUESTIONS

Of course,

14

didn't have Mobile before it.
MR. LEVERETTs

I

the district court

That's correct, sir, it did

16

not.

17

rationalize that by, in effect, saying that Judge Alaimo

18

anticipated Bolden and that he did find discriminatory

19

intent.

20

the process by which he found it is the question.

21

that is, through use of the Zimmer criteria which are

22

disparate impact analysis.

23

But the Fifth Circuit, of course, tried to

11

of the evidence in the case, the contention in this case

ultimately gets down to this;

unconstitutional; is there a constitutional duty on a

14

political subdivision to continually assess its

15

political structure and change it simply in order to

16

favor one group that says that they are entitled to

17

elect candidates of their choice?

18

answer is no, and that's what this Court said in the

19

City of Mobile case.

20

We submit that in applying all of this, in light

and that is, is inaction

We submit that the

We submit that the Zimmer analysis is

21

incorrect not only because it reflects a discriminatory

22

impact or disparate impact analysis, but also because of

23

the methodology that it employs, in that it permits the

24

court to grant relief in a voting-related case based

25

upon violations in other areas, such as public

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

education, public employment.
We submit that in doing this, the court in the

2
3

decision violates the rule that the nature of the

4

violation determines the scope of the remedy.

the courts in the business of pronouncing condemnation

rather than judgment in granting reparations rather than

The tendency of the Zimmer analysis to become

16

1979 in Cross versus Baxter, the Moultrie, Georgia case

17

and the Adarian case from McIntosh County, Georgia, the

18

Fifth Circuit completely switched over and said in all,

19

it*s a question of success, and that the effect of it

20

was to tend to merge the issue of slating with a

21

separate Zimmer factor of a history of prior

22

discrimination which affects present ability of Blacks

23

to have access.

Originally, there were four factors in the

1

plaintiffs had established a lack of slating

requirement, because of the fact that there were not

anymore Blacks on the Democratic Executive Committee.

4

This was inspite of the fact that the undisputed

5

evidence was that these posts are filled by open

election on the same single-member district basis that

the plaintiffs were asking for in this case, aside from

the fact that about the most unimportant and

MR. LEVERETT:

None in the history of Burke

County, so far as we can determine, Justice.
The complete submergence, however, of the

23

three other Zimmer factors by the one dealing with a

24

history of discrimination came in a 1978 decision of the

25

Fifth Circuit in Kirksey versus Supervisors where a

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sharply-divided court held that it was now only

2

necessary to show a past history of discrimination and

3

show that that carried forward present effects.
The court in that case said that it was not

even necessary to even consider Washington versus Davis

and the question of discriminatory intent.

words, this is a remedy case, not a violation case.

In other

We submit that the bottom line of the Zimmer

8
9

analysis which the Fifth Circuit has continued to apply

10

in this case was and is, as the dissent in that case in

11

the Fifth Circuit pointed out, reverse discrimination.
I would like now to address the question of

12
13

Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act which has been argued

14

by the appellees and mentioned by I think all of the

15

four amicus briefs that have been filed in this Court.

16

We submit that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act does

17

not adopt a disparate impact standard.

18

rejected that argument, we submit, in the Mobile case.

19

The Fourth Circuit recently rejected it in the Columbia,

20

South Carolina case in the same terms as has been

21

submitted to this Court by essentially the same parties.
The Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit in

22
23
CM

25

This Court

this case rejected that argument at page 1364 in
footnote 11, and there was no cross-appeal from that
holding.

And we submit that there are valid reasons

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

independently of precedent for rejecting that

2

construction of Section 2.
First, you begin with a rule that you look at

3
4

the language of the statute.

The language of the

5

statute uses "deny and abridge", and as the district

6

court in the Uvalde case recognized, these terms

7

themselves connote intent or purpose.
Secondly, the Section, in using deny or

8

9

abridge utilizes the language of the Fourteenth

10

Amendment, and most specifically, the Fifteenth

11

Amendment.

12

been interpreted as imposing a discriminatory intent

13

sta ndard .

14

And those amendments have unquestionably

Thirdly, when Congress wanted to adopt a

15

disparate impact analysis, it knew very well how to do

16

so in Sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act.

17

And, of course, the rule of statutory construction is

18

that where in one statute Congress uses words in one

19

section and it does not use them in another section, the

20

inference is that it did not intend for that section to

21

have the effect of the other sections.

22

Fourth, the statement of Attorney General

23

Katzenbach that has been relied upon by appellees does

24

not support the interpretation that they place upon it.

25

The Attorney General was not asked whether or not

He was specifically asked

reading a discriminatory purpose requirement into the

statute.

Now, it is certainly true that immediately

11

after that, he proceeded to paraphrase the section, and

12

in doing so, we submit, inadvertently utilized the

13

language of Sections 3, 4 and 5 rather than the language

14

of Section 2.

15

The casualness, however, with which he did

this invokes and brings into effect, we submit, what

this Court held in Allen versus State Board of

Elections, which was to the effect that in any case

Attorney General Burton Marshall as to the meaning of

In that case, the court applied that

words of the statute would themselves indicate.
Now, weighed against this is the statement of

3

Senator Dirksen, -- stated twice, not just once, as this

4

Court's opinion in Mobile had indicated, both at pages

5

171 and 208 of the record before the Senate -- to the

6

effect that Section 2 was simply a restatement of the

7

Fifteenth Amendment, to which Attorney General

8

Katzenbach acquiesced.

9

Fifth, we submit that as a policy matter, this

10

Court should not construe Section 2 as having a

disparate impact analysis in the absence of more

compelling language or legislative history than the

Court is confronted with here.

It would

also raise serious questions about the validity of
candidate and voter qualifications, and possibly require
a validation procedure similar to that used with respect
to employment tests under Title VII of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964.
Moreover, imposing a disparate impact
requirement on Section 2 would create a lot more
mischief than it would even, for example, in the
Fourteenth Amendment.

The reason is that the Fourteenth

Amendment does not purport to protect only certain
people, whereas Section 2 does.

And at least under the

Fourteenth you would have to consider the impact on
everyone, not just on a few.

Under 2, however, it

protects only racial and language minority citizens, and
a disparate impact test there would be almost mandate
for reverse discrimination.
I’d like to reserve what time I have left.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Mr. Walbert?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID F. WALBERT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. WALBERT*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
I think that one issue underlies every
decision of this Court that has dealt with this matter

of legislative reapportionment of racial discrimination,

2

starting with Whitcomb and going to White versus

3

Regester, Burns versus Fordsen and the Mobile case.
That issue is when the normal political

process is going on in any community, when there is the

6

regular give and take and black people or any racial

7

minority may lose at the polls in that circumstance.

8

that's too bad.

you don't have the normal give and take of the political

Well, would there be any question

5

about that if you -- if the fulcrum of your statement is

purposeful discrimination?

disagree with that.

Well, Your Honor, --

I suspect your friend would not

NR. WALBERT;

Well, I think what I’m referring

11

to what the Court has held, for example, in White versus

12

Regester, and I would like to look at the findings in

13

that case and what was relied upon to find exclusion of

14

the political process.

15

And in White versus Regester -- and again,

16

Justice Stevens and the whole Court in the plurality

17

opinion distinguishes white on what ground?

18

that there was no evidence in Nobile — rather, in

19

distinguishing Mobile from White they say there's no

20

evidence there of any real exclusion from the political

21

process that is a result of any kind of discrimination,

22

purposeful or not.

The fact

And the question here, I think, the first

24

question is what is this kind of exclusion from the

25

political process.

Now, I think this case — the

5

that political environment to determine —

QUESTION;

7

MR. WALBERT;

8

QUESTION;

9

Well in the country as a whole.
I suppose that's probably true.

Is that a result of some purposeful

discrimination, or is it just the disinclination of

10

women to run for elective office, or maybe the

11

disinclination of some voters to vote for them?

12

MR. WALBERT;

With all due respect, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, I don't know what the cause of that is, but I

14

do know what the cause is in Burke County.

15

with all respect, the findings of fact of the district

16

court here show quite clearly why it is.

17

findings here.

18

QUESTION;

I think,

We do have

Surely, women were subject for

19

many, many years before the Constitution was amended, to

20

an exclusion from the political process, were they not?

MR. WALBERT;

23

I'm sure that's true.

were not permitted to vote.
MR. WALBERT;

I'm sure that’s true, and

possibly this Court should address that issue in another

Because we show —
QUESTION;

4

Well, does it not bear?

You said

is discriminating against women.

MR. WALBERT;

You can't draw that inference, can

you ?
MR. WALBERT;

I would certainly not draw that

inference in terms of any constitutional conclusion.

We're not trying to do that in this case by any stretch

18

of the imagination.

19

that.

20

We are certainly not trying to do

I think that what we have shown -- and I would

21

like to point out that it is certainly, it is not

22

accurate to say that the district court found no

violations of the explicit right to vote in terms of

24

casting your ballot and registering in this case.

think that we ought to read exactly what was found, and

Mr. Walbert, I*m puzzled by the

district court’s methodology here.

On page 71a, the

23

district courts makes the finding which you quote on the

is being maintained for invidious purposes.
Now, there are two findings on the question of

intent.

One, there was no intent when adopted but is

presently being maintained with a discriminatory

purpose.

conclusion.

I think there’s two reasons for

Fifth Circuit.

16

though, in this case. Judge Alaimo did something more

17

than just a Zimmer analysis.

But it does not create a

all the evidence you could think of to prove intentional

2

discrimination fits in one Zimmer category or another.

3

To say that you outline the evidence by the Zimmer

4

categories almost says nothing.

5

the district court’s opinion because he organized it

6

under the Zimmer categories.

7

There’s no defect in

For example, the very first one, the first

8

Zimmer category, is access to the political system.

Now, I can’t think of any evidence of intentional

wouldn't fit under that category.

I think the question here is — and this has
always been the problem with Zimmer because it's so,
kind of an amorphous thing, but the question is what was

the evidence and what were the findings underneath those

Zimmer categories.

'

There’s

3

always been a freeholder requirement to run for county

4

commissioner, and that has a devastating impact on the

5

ability of the black people to run.

6

So I think that, again, just the fact that

7

Zimmer is used by the district court as a method of

8

organizing the evidence does not tell us that there's

9

something wrong as a matter of law.

And the court of

10

appeals looked very closely and said that the district

11

court did, in fact, make a separate and independent

12

finding of intent.

13

some part, defer to that decision as well.

QUESTIONS

And I think this Court should, in

Mr. Walbert, I guess one of the

15

important things we have to resolve in this case is

16

whether the court of appeals appropriately articulated

17

the standards under Mobile versus Eolden, and the court

18

of appeals in its opinion placed great emphasis on the

19

finding of unresponsiveness.

20

your view of Mobile, or is that sufficient under Mobile,

21

and would you address yourself to the court of appeals

22

and whether it adhered to the Mobile standard.

23
P

We had the freeholder requirement.

MR. WALBERT;

Is that a requirement in

Yes.

I think Justice O'Connor

24

has added in a new burden on the plaintiffs.

It said it

25

as a sine qua non of prevailing, you just prove it as an

1

essential element of the case even if you proved

2

intentional discrimination.

3

it adds something in that Mobile never talked about or

4

never suggested and we would say A, that's wrong, but B,

5

it has nothing to do with this appeal.

6

could have done was hurt us; it could not have hurt the

7

defendant.

Because all that

The court does not give controlling weight to

8
9

So I think in that regard,

the question of responsiveness; only controlling against

10

the plaintiffs.

It does not say if you prove it, that’s

11

a strong inference or presumption of discrimination.

12

expressly says that in one of the footnotes, number of

13

which I can’t recall offhand, but it says that

14

responsiveness is significant only in its absence

15

because that's failed.

16

significance at all to proof of responsiveness, in terms

17

of inferring discrimination.
QUESTION:

18

It does not accord undue

Isn’t this, in your view, this is

19

based on the facts of this case.

20

MR. WALBERT:

21

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

That the district court made the

finding of discrimination, and you don’t want us to go

any further than that, do you?

There was a finding of intentional discrimination

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. WALBERT;

6

And that's all you want.
And that's all that needs to be

assessed.
I think that we have the question of whether

7
8

or not Zimmer, or Mobile, was followed.

And I think

9

there *s a tremendous scholastic analysis of Zimmer and

10

the law in the Fifth Circuit's opinion.

And you can

11

look here and you can look there and you can make

12

something out of this language or that language.

13

fortunately, the Fifth Circuit has a little section in

But

Jurisdictional Statement.
And I think if this Court finds that that is

17

j

And that is on page 39a of the Appendix of the

18

inadequate, then I think Mr. Leverett's right.

19

the case should be reversed as to the finding of

20

intent.

21

established is entirely correct and totally in accord of

22

what the plurality -- even the plurality opinion said in

23

Mobile.

24
25

I think

But I think that decision of what the rule

And that's this:

First of all, the court says

that according to the plurality -- and again, the

3

in any other direction; it tried to follow the plurality

4

opinion.

6

system.

7

consistent with the plurality.

It said discriminatory purpose is necessary in

That's the first thing, and that’s certainly

Secondly, it says that you may infer intent

8
9

It didn’t try and go off

from the totality of the circumstantial evidence.

There

10

now is no dispute over that, Mr. Leverett agrees with

11

that.

12

The third thing it says is an essential

13

element of the prima facie case is unresponsiveness and

14

we just talked about that.

15

Mow, the next thing in here is really where he

16

talks about Zimmer and I’d like to read this portion.

17

It’s about three sentences and it says this;

18

QUESTION;

What page are you on?

MR. WALBERT;

This is page 39a of the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

exclusive indicia of discriminatory purpose, and to the

2

extent that they are not factually relevant in a given

3

case, they may be replaced or supplemented by more

4

meaningful factors.

5

factors are established, an inference of discriminatory

6

purpose is not necessarily to be drawn.

Even if all the Zimmer and other

The trial court must consider the totality of

7

8

the circumstances and ultimately on the precise issue of

9

discriminatory purpose, and that is the rule established

10

by the court of appeals in this case, and that complies,

11

in my opinion, absolutely 100% with the plurality

12

opinion in Mobile.

13

The court of appeals then went on to apply it

14

to the facts of this case and said that's just what the

15

district court did; it made that ultimate, precise

16

finding of intentional discrimination and intentional

17

motivation and purpose in using the at-large system,

18

based on all the circumstantial evidence available to it.
And the evidence here -- again, it just pales

10

MR. WALBERT:

11

QUESTION:

12

I think it's about 40%.

38% was the figure that I thought I

recalled .
MR. WALBERT:

13

38% of the registered voters are

14

black, and 62% are white, but I'm not sure what the

15

percentage of whites and blacks are.
QUESTION:

16
17

And 40% of them are registered, is

that it?
MR. WALBERT:

18

I think that's not right.

I'm

19

not sure what the exact number is on that and I wouldn't

20

want to say without actually calculating that, at this

21

time.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Walbert, isn't it probable that

23

in every colored jurisdiction in the South where there

24

was substantial impediment to voting prior to 65 that

you would have a case proved upon the Zimmer factors by

2

MR. WALBERT;

3

QUESTION*

Your Honor, again --

Regardless of whether it's at-large

4

or what.

Whatever it is, these factors would prove

5

invidious intent, wouldn't they?

6

MR. WALBERT;

I think maybe the best answer to

7

that is the only other written order I know of that

8

Judge Alaimo rendered in this case showed Zimmer-type

9

factors in the sense Your Honor may mean, and then they

10

lost.

That’s the McIntosh County case that Mr. Leverett

referred to.

But I think that, again, the evidence —
QUESTION:

That’s true in so many -- the thing

11

that puzzles me is whether it’s the district boundaries

12

that are the remedy for that kind of very plain evil.

13

It certainly --

14

MR. HALBERT;

Your Honor, all I can say is the

15

best answer to that is to just read the district court's

opinion and read the Fifth Circuit opinion, and I

honestly think there can't be much doubt about the

inadequacy of that one little remedy.

MR. HALBERT:

Justice Stevens, in the sense that you talk about it in

There is no give and take.

That doesn't exist

10

in Burke County, and by no stretch of the imagination is

11

that characteristic of the South today.

12

In fact, --

13

QUESTIONj

Well, if all those things are true,

14

I don't care what your boundaries are, they just don’t

15

have a chance.
MR. WALBERT:

16

Well, I think that an

17

interesting thing happened after the district court’s

18

order in 1978 which was ultimately studied by this

19

Court, but five districts were set up, and we

20

immediately saw for the first time in the history of the

21

county five black people qualified for each of those

22

district election posts, pursuant to the district court

23

order.

24
25

I think that speaks quite loudly in terms of
what would happen to the political process if you had

4B

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

majority black districts, which is inevitable if you

2

re-district the system.

3

Then I think you’re going to see a complete change in

4

the political behavior in the political process.

5

think that's inevitable.

That is absolutely inevitable.

I

And I don't think that isolated remedies, —

6
7

as the court of appeals said, an isolated remedy will

8

not do it in Burke County.

9

to this problem, and the lynchpin of it is the

10

There is too many dimensions

intentional maintenance of the system — and again, -QUESTION:

11

The irony of the remedy is that in

12

a county which according to the facts found by the

13

district court — you tell me the 1980 Census is

14

different now — the majority black county, he divides

15

up five districts and gives majority whites — the

16

whites are in the majority in three of the five.

17

could imagine people with the racially-discriminatory

18

purpose on the white side of the ledger wanting that

19

remedy.

20

did .

21

I

I suppose it would be unconstitutional if they

MR. WALBERT;

I think the key is to look at

22

what the purpose was.

I don't know if we should

23

conjecture about this or that.

24

to be a discriminatory -- the purpose here was to

25

discriminate in the use of at-large elections, in this

I mean, there was found

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

case under these facts.

And I think that's really the

2

key to it.

3

happened over in Mobile or what might happen in the next

4

county over in Wilkes County, what might happen in

5

Augusta, Georgia.

And we shouldn't say what might have

What happened here is that the district court

6
7

found, based on all this incredible evidence, that there

8

was —

9

QUESTION*

Would this remedy be

10

unconstitutional if there were evidence in the record

11

that some white bigots favored this way of getting the

12

three-to-two majority control?

13

could — you know, sometimes people of the same race

14

have different views as to what's in their best interest.

15

MR. WALBERTs

Sure.

I could imagine that

I think not, Your Honor,

16

because I think, again, something is very clear from

17

this record.

18

so long as the at-large system is maintained, period.

19

That can be remedied only by having a district election

20

system, period.

21

And that is black people will be excluded

Those two things are unequivocal.

So, to remedy the existing exclusion, if you

22

can't do it by keeping at-large, you must have a

23

district system.

24

gerrymandering the system so you could have allegations

25

of racism or racial discrimination as a gerrymander, and

Now certainly, I can conceive of

So there’s no opinion of this

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

consider that issue.
And our position is not, as Mr. Leverett says,

2
3

that everything with any impact or effect on black,

4

voters is illegal under Section 2.

5

simply that where you have a neutral device that

6

perpetuates these clear cosequences of past purposeful

7

discrimination, then that is reached — those kind of

8

effects and only those are reached by Section 2 of the

9

Voting Rights Act.

Our position is

I think that if we look at the plurality

10
11

opinion we can see one problem with it right away, and

12

that is that it holds that Section 2 applies only to

13

outright and absolute denials of the right to vote only

14

if you are not allowed into the voting booth, and that’s

15

a problem.

16

is exactly like the coverage provision of Section 5.

17

That is, the kind of practices that are covered has

18

exactly the same language.

19

that.

20

Because the coverage provision of Section 2

There's no question about

This Court held unanimously I think it was in

21

Allen versus Board of Elections that that language

22

covers at-large elections.

23

we really have to recognize that the plurality was in

24

error was with regard to that construction, that aspect

25

of Section 2.

So the only question I think

And it really should seriously -- I think

52
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Court should seriously consider that issue and

2

dispose of this case on a Section 2 ground.

Now, —

4

QUESTION;

5

What did the court of appeals say

about that issue?
MR. WALBERT;

6

They followed the plurality.

7

They followed the plurality ruling, Your Honor, and they

8

just followed the plurality.

9

-- that Section 2 did not give a cause of action above

They said that we did not

10

and beyond what the Constitution or the Fifteenth

11

Amendment would in its own right.
QUESTION t

12
13

So your Section 2 argument was

presented -MR. WALBERT;

14

Oh absolutely.

We pled it in

15

our complaint, we raised it at all stages of the case,

16

and we presented it to the court of appeals and it was

17

rejected.

18

But we do rely on that in appeal.
Now, I think that the legislative history is

19

very clear on this, too.

20

Katzenbach's statement.

21

over that Attorney General Katzenbach's statements about

22

what the Voting Rights Act meant are very important

23

because he wrote it.

24
25

There is Attorney General
This court has said over and

This is an administration proposal.

And finally, Your Honors, the 1981 legislative
history confirms all this where the members of Congress

53

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

have anything further?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. FREEMAN LEVERETT, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — Rebuttal

6

MR. LEVERETT;

7
8

Mr. Leverett, do you

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We take issue with counsel when he says that

9
10

this case differs from the facts in Mobile.

All I can

11

suggest is that the Court read the district court

12

decision and compare the findings and the facts there

13

with those in this case.
Counsel says that the court pressured the

14
15

registration sites and achieved the three additional

16

registration sites.

17

10,

18

to the request of the organization that brought this

19

case.

20

approximately two months later.

21

that the sites were not opened until a week or ten days

22

prior to the election, but they were opened in response

23

to a request and not in accordance with any pressuring

24

from the court, and the district court’s statement to

25

that effect is completely without any evidence at all

The commissioners voted on February

1976 to add these new registration sites in response

This case was not filed until April 5th,
It is certainly true

54

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

and is, in fact, not true.
Counsel made the statement that registration

3

has been restrictive in Burke County.

4

the fact that until 1976 there was only one registration

5

site to indicate restriction of the right to register.

6

I cannot equate

Burke County has only 18,000 people.

The

7

plaintiff himself admitted that there were probably not

8

more than 2000 people who even were potential voters who

9

had not registered.

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. LEVERETT;

How many square miles is it?
About 800 square miles, which

12

is about a square about 28 to 29 miles, with

13

approximately 18,000 people.

14

And I would further submit that the evidence

15

in this case shows that notwithstanding the cries about

16

we need these registration sites, the undisputed

17

evidence is that in one of these registration places,

18

only 50 or 60 voters had been registered by the time of

19

the trial there, and another one less than 100.

20

I came up here this past week I checked on it and it's

21

still less than 100 in each of the new registration

22

sites, which indicates that they were not needed that

23

much after all, anyway.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. LEVERETT;

Before

How many registration sites now?
Mr. Chief Justice, there are at

I

at the county site in Waynesboro.

They finally had to pick up the cards and it was put

somewhere else.

There would be

There may be one at

It was originally established, the

Then the last statement was made that the —

9
10

just look what happened when the court order relief.

11

course, two of the plaintiffs in this case ran in that

12

election, and I'm sure that there was some encouraging

13

of others to run to make a demonstration of response.

14

And of course, I might say that one of the plaintiffs

15

ran after the plaintiff’s plan had been approved, which

16

deliberately gerrymandered the lines to put there of the

17

incumbent commissioners in one district against Mr.

18

Lodge, and they even tried to amend it to put a fourth

19

one in, but the court did not go that far.
We submit that the judgment below should be

reversed .
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Thank you, gentlemen,

the case is submitted.

argument in the above-entitled matter was concluded.)
