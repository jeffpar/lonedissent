CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

first this morning in Larson against Valente.
Mr. Salustro, you may proceed whenever you are

ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF LARRY SALUSTRO, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

7

MR. SALUSTRO:

8
9

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case involves the narrow issue of the

10 constitutionality under the establishment clause of an
11

exemption provision in Minnesota's Charitable Solicitation

12

Act.

13

disclosure requirements otherwise applicable to charitable

14

organizations in the Act those religious organizations and

15

societies which solicit more than half of their

16

contributions from their members and from their affiliates.

17

The provision in question exempts from the financial

The appeal presents the question whether the

18

establishment clause prohibits a state from tailoring a

19

regulatory program to allow coverage of some religious

20 organizations where

the application of the law to religious

21 organizations is based on criteria unrelated to matters of
22 religious belief or
23

dogma.

Plaintiffs in this case are the Holy Spirit

24

Association for the Unification of World Christianity,

25

Incorporated, and four of its members.

Defendants are the

1 two state officials in the state of Minnesota responsible
2 for enforcing the provisions of Minnesota's Charitable
3 Solicitation Act.
4

I will discuss the provisions declared

5 unconstitutional, the procedural history of the
6 establishment clause issue in the court below, and why this
7 Court should reverse the decision of the court of appeals.
8

QUESTION;

Where are the provisions set out

9 completely?
10

MR. SALUSTRO;

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. SALUSTRO;

The provisions of the --

Minnesota law.
-- Minnesota law are set out

13 completely in the jurisdictional statement.
14

QUESTION;

Not just the provision that you

are

15 talking about.
16

MR. SALUSTRO;

Provision of the entire Charitable

17 Solicitation law set out as an

appendix to the

18 jurisdictional statement.
19

QUESTION;

20

MR. SALUSTRO;

21 state of Minnesota

Thank you.
Through financial disclosure, the

seeks to inform charitable contributors

22 of the organizations that are soliciting contributions from
23 them.

The state seeks to protect contributors from fraud

24 and from misrepresentation by those organizations as to the
25 identity of

the organization, the purpose of the

4

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 organization, and the use to which funds are put by that
2 organization.
3

Through a series of six exemptions, Minnesota has

4 determined that disclosure is not always necessary to
5 effectuate the state's objectives.

One of these six

6 exemptions is the exemption for religious organizations and
7 societies that solicit more than half of their contributions
8 from their members and affiliates, and the narrow issue here
9 is the application of the establishment clause to that
10 provision.
11

The procedural history here -QUESTION:

Mr. Salustro, what is the rationale for

12 treating religious organizations differently from patriotic
13 and fraternal ones?
14

MR. SALUSTRO:

The criteria used in religious

15 organizations and in fraternal and patriotic organizations,
16 the criteria for exemption is the same, namely, the extent
17 to which they solicit contributions from the general
18 public.

The only difference is that the point of the -- the

19 point on the line where the exemption is drawn is different

20 for those organizations.
21

This has the result of exempting more religious

22 organizations than fraternal and patriotic organizations, so
23 to that extent it is a more —
24

QUESTION:

You think it exempts more religious

25 organizations?

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

ME. SALUSTROi

1

Yes, unquestionably,

It exempts

2 more religious organizations.

3

QUESTION s

Is that a fact?

4

MR. SALUSTRO:

It's not a fact, but I think it is

5 a mathematical certainty, because the fraternal and
6 patriotic organizations that raise any of their money from

7 the general public outside their membership lose their
8 exemption.

The religious organizations can raise up to 50

9 percent of the money from -- up to 50 percent of the money
10 from the general

public and not lose the exemption, so it is

11 a more beneficial,
12

a more hands-off treatment of religious

organizations as a class than fraternal and patriotic

13 organizations as a class, although the criteria used is
14 exactly the same.
15

QUESTION*

Counsel, the point raised by Justice

16 Blackmun is one that I would like to pursue with you also,
17 because I don't understand the answer.
18

What is the reason for the different treatment of

19 these types of organizations?

What is the reason that is

20 advanced by the state for that difference?
21

MR. SALUSTROi

Well, the reason that is advanced

22 by the state is that the state of Minnesota

wants to be more

23 careful about extending its regulatory program to religious
24 organizations.

Where the state interest in those

25 organizations is small, then it is concerned about extending

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 its regulatory program to fraternal organizations.
2

There are — we have a very different interest in

3 religious organizations among themselves in this program.
4 The purpose of the

program is to provide information to

5 donors and contributors who don't have that

information.

6 There are a wide range of kinds of charitable -- of
7 religious charitable organizations.

There are religious

8 charitable organizations that solicit exclusively from
9 members of

10

the public, 100 percent from the general public.
As far as our interest in providing information to

11 donors that don't have it, we have a very great interest in
12 disclosure by those organizations.

On the other hand, there

13 are organizations that solicit only from members who are
14 intimately familiar

with the finances of the organization,

15 at the other end of

the spectrum.

16 interest in

We have much less

requiring disclosure, public disclosure from

17 those organizations because the members who are the donors
18 of those organizations already have that information

19 available to them or can get it.
20

QUESTION;

Are there not more hurdles to get over

21 when you are dealing with a religious organization?

That

22 is, a religious organization has all the protection of the
23 speech and press clauses, I would assume, and in addition to
24 that it has the protection of the religion clauses which are
25 not necessarily available to fraternal and patriotic

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

organizations.

Is that not so?

MR. SALUSTRO:

2

Yes, sir, that is correct, Your

3

Honor.

What I was trying to explain is that we have a

4

different -- we have a relatively lower interest in some

5

religious organizations and the exemption provision is

6 different because we want to leave organizations alone where
7

our interest is so small.

8 many cases by this Court,
9

There is no doubt that there are
many charitable solicitation cases

by this Court, and what we are talking about here is

10 solicitation from
11 those cases,

the general public, and in a number of

the Court has -- the Court has looked at

12 disclosure type programs and distinguished

the kind of

13

regulation that disclosure type programs have from

14

prohibitory regulation, and in the Cantwell case and in the

15

Schaumburg case, and in some other cases where the Court has

16

looked at this particular question, it has determined that

17

disclosure kind of regulation does not have to meet the same

18

tests as regulation which has the effect of directly

19

prohibiting organizations and members of organizations from

20 soliciting contributions from the general public.
21

QUESTION*

You also have a category in your law of

22 charitable organizations generally.
23

MR. SALUSTROs

24

QUESTION*

25

MR. SALUSTRO;

Charitable organizations, yes.

Different from fraternal and patriotic.
They are different --

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTIONi

Well, it says charitable organizations

2 are exempt if they didn't receive more than $10,000 from the
3 public.
4

MR. SALUSTRO*

Charitable organizations as far as

5 that exemption is concerned includes the entire list of
6 organizations.

It includes religious organizations.

7 includes fraternal organizations.

It

It includes all

8 organizations soliciting contributions for charitable
9 purposes.

A $10,000 limitation -- or exemption is available

10 to all organizations.

It is available to religious ones who

11 are not exempted by the other provision.

It is available to

12 fraternal and patriotic ones who are not.
13

So, any of the organizations --

14

QUESTION*

But charitable organizations generally

15 can raise up to $10,000 from the public without
16 registering.

Is that it?

And fraternal organizations can't

17 raise any from the public without registering it?
18

MR. SALUSTRO*

Fraternal -- any organization,

19 charitable, fraternal, religious, can raise $10,000 from the
20 public without registering.
21

QUESTIONi

That isn't what Subparagraph D says

22 about fraternal and patriotic organizations.
23

MR. SALUSTRO:

Fraternal and patriotic

24 organizations have two different criteria for being exempt.
25 One criteria is that they raise all of their money from

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 their members.

The other criteria is, and completely

2 independent, that they raise less than £10,000.
3 true with religious organizations.
4 possibilities of being exempt.

The same is

There are two different

One is raising most of their

5 money from their membership or affiliates.

Two, raising up

6 to £10,000.
7

QUESTION:

In any event, you suggest that you

8 treat religious societies the most favorably.

They get the

9 most favorable treatment as compared to charitable

10 organizations generally?
11

MR. SALUSTR0;

They are treated better than

12 fraternal or patriotic organizations -13

QUESTION:

Or charitable.

14

MR. SAIUSTRO:

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. SALUSTR0:

— even though the --

Or charitable generally.
Yes, or charitable, even though the

17 criteria for the exemption in question is the same, and has
18 nothing to do with religion.

We think, that based on --

19 well, there are two different parts of the analysis of the
20 exemption provision.

One is the decision that there is

21 going to be an exemption provision for religious
22 organizations.

That kind of decision takes -- takes into

23 consideration that the state has some leeway in treating
24 religious organizations somewhat better, somewhat more
25 liberally, somewhat more at a distance than other kinds of

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 organizations, and the Court said in the Walz case and the
2 Court said in some other cases that there is some leeway for
3 the state to do that without necessarily violating the
4 establishment clause.

So, that criteria of religious

5 organization is there.
6

The second question is, once it is determined that

7 there will be a religious exemption, how should the
8 exemption be structured, and in Minnesota's case, what we
9 have done here is used a secular criteria to structure the
10 exemption.

The criteria has nothing to do with religion,

11 with religious values, with the content of free speech.

The

12 value is purely secular, whether the organization solicits
13 from the general public.

It is not only secular, it is tied

14 to the purposes of the Act, which is providing information
15 to people that don't have information that receive
16 solicitations from charitable organizations.
17

18 point?

QUESTION;

May I ask you a question right on that

Suppose you have two religious organizations, each

19 of which raises $500,000 every year, and for one of them

20 that is substantially all they raise; for another, they also
21 raise internally $600,000.

Why should the state interest be

22 different for those two organizations?

It is the same

23 amount of soliciation of funds from the public.

24

MR. SALUSTRO;

The state's interest is different

25 in this exemption, and your question is correct.

One of

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 those organizations will be exempt and one not, and that is
2 the way —
3

QUESTION!

Isn't the state interest the same for

4 the two?

There is precisely the same amount of soliciation

5 from the public.
6

MR. SALUSTRO:

No, we think that there is a

7 difference in that one organization is raising most of its
8 money from the general public.

One organization is raising

9 most of its money internally, and that goes to the extent to
10 which the organization can raise money from the public and
11 take advantage of the opportunity if it chooses to to engage

12 in misrepresentation.
13

It is very correct that if dollar --

14

QUESTION;

Don’t they both have the same

15 opportunity to misrepresent?

16

MR. SALUSTRO:

If dollar figures, if dollar

17 criteria would be different, then you could ask me, what

18 about the dollars here and the dollars there, and doesn't
19 that mean that one organization raises 95 percent of its

20 funds internally and another raises 5, and it doesn't make
21 any sense.

22
23 to do it.

It is our position that this is a reasonable way
There are other reasonable ways to do it, but the

24 standard that we have to find with this particular criteria
25 is whether the line we have chosen is not rational, whether

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 it is arbitrary, whether it is invidious, and that comes out
2 of the United States versus Gillette test, United States
3 versus Gillette case, and it is not arbitrary, and it is not
4 invidious merely because there are other ways it could have
5 been done, but had one of those other ways been chosen, the
6 dollar way, then you would have exactly the same opportunity
7 to ask me that kind of question.
8

QUESTION:

In other words, your answer, as I

9 understand it, is, you’ve got to draw the line some place,
10 and so this is as good as any other line.

That is the only

11 reason for drawing this particular line, as I understand

12 your argument.
13

MR. SALUSTRO:

No, I think the line can be — the

14 line is justified as being drawn here because it is the
15 place where a charitable organization relies primarily on
16 public funding rather than primarily on internal funding,
17 and whether primarily public funding is a tiny amount of
18 money or whether it is a large amount of money, that fact
19 remains that now this organization relies more on the

20 general public to raise its funds than it does internally.
21

QUESTION:

When you say internal funding, you mean

22 members or communicants or whatever it may be?
23

MR. SALUSTRO:

We mean members and we mean

24 affiliated organizations.
25

We are not saying that the state does not care

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

about fraud committed by organizations on the members of the

2 organization.

That is not the question.

But this

3 legislative solution goes to providing information to people
4 that don’t have it and don't have the opportunity to get
5 it.

Without public disclosure, the general public does not

6 have the opportunity to get that information.

That is why

7 it is important that it be supplied as far as the general
8 public is concerned.

With members, members have the

9 opportunity to get it, and it is not that we are not
10

11

concerned about fraud -QUESTION;

That was not my question.

12 your argument about members.

I understand

I am talking about non-members

13 who contribute $500,000 every year to an organization that
14 gets $600,000 from its own membership.

They don’t have any

15 different access to information than if they were in the
16 other category, do they?
17

MR. SALUSTRO;

18 correct, Your Honor.
19

QUESTION;

20 haven't heard
21

No, that’s correct.

That’s

That’s correct.
Well, what is the explanation?

it quite yet.

I

Why shouldn't the same public

that is without that information, why shouldn’t they have it

22 with respect to the

$500,000, that is less than half of what

23 the organization raises?
24

MR. SALUSTRO;

The point is drawn at the place

25 that it is drawn.

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

I know.

That is restating your

2 position, but you haven't said why, or what the
3 justification is.
4

MR. SALUSTRO;

We have a continuum.

It is clear

5 that at one end of the continuum organizations raise their
6 money solely from members, and it's our position that we can
7 stay away from that end as far as extending this regulatory
8 program because we don't have a sufficient interest arguably
9 to reach that end of the spectrum.
10
11

QUESTION;

As we move up this way --

Well, why don't you have?

I know you

keep saying that, but --

12

MR. SALUSTRO;

13

QUESTION;

Because —

Suppose two organizations raise

14 $500,000 from ten people, from ten people.

The same ten

15 people give the same amount of money to two organizations.
16 And in the one case you will say those ten people must have
17 information about the organization and in the other case
18 they aren't told a thing.
19

They don’t have to be told a

thing, as long as the money they give is less than half of

20 the organization's funding.
21

MR. SALUSTRO;

That result comes out of the

22 particular criteria that are used.

We don't think, although

23 the result appears unusual, we don’t think it is arbitrary.
24 We don’t think it is invidious, and we don't think it is
25 drawn on any basis of religion.

QUESTION *

I know that

I grant you

I

2 understand your assertion, but you haven't explained why you
3 distinguish between those two organizations yet.
4 guess you have said about as much as you can.
5

QUESTION*

But I

Is that it?

Well, aren't you also saying that where

6 you are talking about any organization that receives a
7 certain

percentage of its funding from members or

8 communicants that it is more likely to be controlled or — I
9 can't think of the exact word I

want to use, but subjected

10 to internal discipline by its own membership than, say, an
11 organization which gets 1 percent of its funding from its
12 own members and solicits 99 percent from the outside?
13

HR. SALUSTRO*

Yes, Your Honor, exactly.

14 a charitable solicitation law.

This is

We are worried about

15 matching representations about what is going to be done with
16 funds contributed to what actually is done with the funds

17 that are contributed.

Hembers are going to be aware of what

18 is done with the funds contributed, and members are not

19 going to be in the same position of vulnerability as far as
20 representations made, this is what I am going to do with
21 your money, as are strangers to the organizations.
22 have controls.

Members

Hembers have the ability to see books.

23 Members can ask questions.

Members have a general idea of

24 whether the people that are running the organization are
25 trustworthy .

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

Well, Mr. Salustro, presumably those

2 same reasons apply to non-religious charitable groups, right?
3

MR. SALUSTRO:

4

QUESTION:

5 to those entirely.

Yes.

Yes, they do.

And yet you apply a different standard
So it is just difficult to understand

6 how the state can justify the 50 percent line within the
7 religious charitable organization category but not the
8 others, because your arguments would apply equally well to
9 the other types of charitable organizations, would they not?
10
11

MR. SALUSTRO;

They would, Your Honor, and it is

the position of the state that it can, as far as requiring

12 information from organizations, it is the position of the
13 state that it can be more liberal with religious
14 organizations, that it can keep its distance somewhat from
15 religious organizations where the state interest is not as
16 pronounced, and that comes out of the Walz case, among other
17 cases.
18

The state can accommodate religious values.

19 comes out of the religion clauses.

20 come out of the First Amendment.

It

It doesn't necessarily
We think we could do the

21 same thing with other First Amendment organizations, and in
22 fact we do with the $10,000 limitation.
23 identically.

We don't treat them

They can both have First Amendment rights; if

24 one organization raises less than $10,000,
25

it is exempt.

And that is a discrimination that is made on the

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

same kind of criteria we use here,

2 criteria.

It is a reasonable

The lines are not drawn arbitrarily or

3 invidiously,

and we can treat those kinds of organizations

4 differently.
5 And that is

We don't have to put them all in one boat.
what we do with religious organizations, but it

6 happens that a little bit some more of them are going to be
7 exempt because we are not interested in

extending regulatory

8 programs to religious organizations where we don *t think
9 have that interest,

we

and we don't think that the

10

establishment clause requires us to extend regulatory

11

programs to religious organizations, to increase the contact

12

with religious organizations where we don't think we have a

13 sufficient interest,
14 requiring that

certainly not the establishment clause

we do that.

So that is why the line is drawn differently for

15

16 religious organizations.

QUESTION;

17

You might be in trouble, might you not,

18 under cases like Sherbert against Verner and Indiana
19 Thomas versus
20

—

Indiana Employment Security Commission, if you

were to get too close to a religious organization?

21
22 that.

MR. SALUSTROs

Yes, Your Honor.

I agree with

We would have some difficulty, and we — there are

23 two questions.

One is, would we have difficulty, would that

24 be unconstitutional under the religion clauses as in some
25 cases it might have been under those cases.

The second

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 question is, even if we don't reach the limit or the point
2 of unconstitutionality, can the state nonetheless draw back
3 somewhat from that?

And it is clearly stated in the Walz

4 case, I think, that the point at which the state can
5 accommodate religious organizations is not the same point at
6 which the religion clause, the free exercise clause requires
7 that the state do that.
8

QUESTION*

Would you say it would be permissible

9 for the state to have precisely the same requirements with
10 respect to all charitable and religious organizations
11 insofar as registering and disclosure is concerned?

12

MR. SALUSTRO:

13

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.

You could just have across the board --

14 is there some case like that?

You are saying that you may

15 regulate religious solicitations in the identical way you
16 may regulate non-religious charitable solicitation.
17

MR. SALUSTRO:

Yes, I am saying we may do that.

18 And we do make distinctions between First Amendment — the
19 $10,000 limit applies to First Amendment free speech type

20 organizations and religious ones, and we could do that
21 across the board.
22

QUESTION;

And it would be valid if you just

23 eliminated Subsection — the religious -- the particular
24 religious provision here?
25

MR. SALUSTRO;

The legislature could have — the

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 legislature could have made the decision to do that, yes.
2

QUESTION;

Is there some case you rely on that you

3 can treat -- that you can regulate religious solicitations?
4

MR. SALUSTROs

5 solicitations?

We can regulate religious

Well, Cantwell versus Connecticut certainly

6 concerned a religious organization.

Village of Schaumburg

7 didn't concern a religious organization, but I am not clear

8 that this Court has held that there is a hierarchy of First
9 Amendment values, that religious organizations have more
10 First Amendment protection than other free speech type

11 organizations.

So I think we can treat them identically as

12 charitable organizations, as a group of charitable
13 organizations, as the Court did in Walz.

It included the

14 whole group of charitable organizations for the purpose of
15 tax exemption.
16

QUESTION;

Well, what if a religious organization

17 as part of their doctrine -- suppose part of their doctrine
18 is the duty to raise money?

19

MR. SALUSTRO;

20 the duty to raise money.

We are not prohibiting them from
The right that they would have to

21 assert would be the right -- the right to raise money from
22 the general public, from strangers, and the right to refuse
23 to tell the general public what they have done with the
24 money.

They have to assert those two rights.

Now, it is

25 theoretically possible that there could be such a religious

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 organization that asserts those rights, but I think the
2 proper remedy there would be to create an exemption for that
3 particular organization on religious rights grounds, and not
4 to throw out the entire statute here because there is some
5 possible application in the future that is going to conflict
6 with religious doctrine,
7

QUESTION;

What bearing do you think the Krishna

8 Consciousness case that the Court decided last spring has on
9 this?
10

MR. SALUSTRO;

Well, it is a case concerning

11 solicitation, and it is a case concerning -- well, a case

12 concerning raising funds and state regulation.

In that

13 case, the Krishnas could be treated as other First Amendment
14 groups were.

The notion that religious organizations have

15 more First Amendment protection as far as raising money is
16 concerned than other First Amendment organizations do, that
17 seems to have been rejected in that case.

18

The other issue that is before the Court is the

19 issue of whether plaintiffs have standing to invoke the

20 jurisdiction of the Court to declare this exemption
21 provision unconstitutional on establishment clause grounds.

22 This argument is set out in our brief.

The cases say that

23 the proper inquiry is whether plaintiffs have a personal
24 stake in the outcome of the action and suffer an injury
25 which will be redressed by a favorable decision.

21

The procedural posture of this case in the court

2 below is crucial.

This is plaintiff's motion for summary

3 judgment that is on appeal here.

On plaintiff's motion for

4 summary judgment, the disputed facts are resolved against
5 the plaintiffs.

One of the disputed facts in the district

6 court and the circuit court, and plaintiffs acknowledge it
7 here, is whether they are a religious organization.
8

Because summary judgment is involved, as a matter

9 of law on this motion, plaintiffs are not a religious
10 organization.

This appeal concerns only the exemption

provision for religious organizations.

it is up to them to raise that

3 point.
If this Court should strike down the exemption

4

5 provision for religious organizations, it will not as a
6 matter of law do plaintiffs any good

in this case.

We think

7 this is a clear case that there is no injury, there is no

and there is no standing.

I reserve whatever time I have.

Very well.

ORftL ARGUMENT OF BARRY A. FISHER, ESQ.,

12

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

13

MR. FISHER*

14

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

15 Court, after 17 years with a charitable soliciation statute
16 like other states, categorically, neutrally, evenhandedly
17 exempting all churches, Minnesota amended its statute,
18 taking that exemption away from some but not other churches,
19 subjecting them to the statute’s comprehensive regulatory
20 and

licensing requirements, including extensive

21 recordkeeping,
22 filings,

CPA certification, substantial record

expenditure limitations, access, disclosure, and

23 publication of church documents, and an open-ended
24 nationwide investigation, all provisions, I think, which
25 comrephensively facilitate a sustained, detailed enforcement

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 audit as to what are bona fide religious expenditures,
2 solicitations and religions.
3

And the statute, Your Honors, arms the licenser

4 with broad investigative powers and provides for license
5 suspension, revocation, receivership, criminal prosecution
6 for enforcing this law and this regulatory scheme which
7 surely imposes burdens, substantial burdens on churches,
8 burdens which simply aren't remote or de minimis.
9

QUESTION;

Mr. Fisher?

10

MR. FISHER;

11

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
You don't contend that a state couldn't

12 reguire some disclosure from all religious organizations
13 which seek to solicit funds, do you?
14

MR. FISHER;

That is certainly not this case.

I

15 think that it may, if it were evenhandedly applied to all
16 churches, may, depending on how it is done, pose some
17 entanglement problems possibly.

But it is certainly not

18 this case, Your Honor.
19

QUESTION;

Suppose the Exemption B, which is the

20 one that is at issue here, 309.515(b), suppose that were
21 just not in the law, and that all religious organizations
22 were covered under the charitable provision.

MR. FISHER;

There would not be a problem of neutrality

and evenhandedness, and there would be, I think, the

Is that it?

MR. FISHER:

I think also there would be the

7 this morning respecting unequal treatment of churches
8 vis-a-vis other charitable organizations.
9

QUESTION*

Yes.

Don't you agree, though — as I

10 understand it, churches can either -- they can raise -- any
11 church can raise up to $10,000 without registering.

12

MR. FISHER*

Yes.
But then they can also raise up to

14 one-half, up to 49.9 percent of their funding.

1 those churches that it does apply to deserves the Court's
2 scrutiny, both as to the substantiality of the reason for
3 drawing any line at all treating churches unequally, saying
4 that some have to bear the onus of regulation and others
5 don't and the substantiality of the reason for drawing the
6 line where it is, and this close scrutiny, I suggest, is
7 called for by the establishment clause's core, most
8 essential principle of scrupulous intersectarian
9 evenhandednass between churches.
10

And what is the reason here for this disparate

11 treatment, this jerrymandering of churches?

Your Honors,

12 absolutely no facts, no logic or reason I think explain this
13 disparate treatment.

There is no mention whatsoever of any

14 reason for this in the legislative history, and strikingly,
15 absolutely,

there is not a single mention whatsoever of any

16 purpose or reason for this law mentioned by appellants to
17 the court of appeals.

Hothing.

There is nothing in their

18 briefs, nothing in their argument.
19

It wasn't until the eleventh hour of this

20 litigation before this Court that in their briefs they start
21 positing possible explanations for this law, and it really

22 changes.

12 for a reason for this unequal treatment just doesn’t work.

18

MR. FISHER*

Your Honor, I don't think that this

19 is the same as Gillette, nor — even if it were -20

QUESTION*

Well, why?

21

MR. FISHER*

Even if it were, Gillette's depth of

22 analysis, I think, would decide this statute's

23 unconstitutionality.

The analysis in that case was

24 substantial, and not the appellant's proposed test here of
25 some one-dimensional application of a mechanical test, just

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 looking to see if you can find any secular purpose
2 whatsoever and then that is the end of the inquiry.

That

3 isn’t what the Court did, and if it was, or if the Court
4 were to adopt such a test, it would eliminate two-thirds of
5 the tripartite test in Lemon, a test which was -- brought
6 together all the extant strands of establishment clause
7 cases at that time and discussed them, didn't even mention
8 Gillette, nor has Gillette ever been mentioned by any
9 establishment clause case of this Court in the ten years
10 since decided.
11

It is just -- there is a complete analysis there

12 as to the justification for the underinclusiveness in
13 Gillette, including

that the Congress went as far as it

14 could, accommodating free exercise,

that the -- to go any

15 further would pose entanglement problems, and it would be

16 impossible to administer, and that the Court was deferring
17 to the government’s overriding Article 1, Section 8
18 interests that were the basis of that legislation.
19

This legislation here is legislation regulating

20 churches on its face, directly.

In Gillette, the Court also

21 pointed out that that was a law not on its face with

22 disparate de facto impacts.

This is legislation saying that

23 some churches should be regulated, some shouldn't.

The

24 legislature absolutely understood that there were churches
25 on both sides of the line or they wouldn’t have amended the

what the reason is, whether it is 90 percent, 10 percent, or

11

50 percent.

12

Well, suppose the reason is that the

16 enough safeguard.

I think, by any logic, reason, or facts.

I mean,

members of churches on one side of the line, those

24 power and are no more likely to protect the public by
25 scrutinizing public solicitations and expenditures of moneys

QUESTION*

3

What if the legislature had made

4 findings to that effect?

I know you probably wouldn't agree

5 with them, but at least it would have been a legislative

6 judgment.
7

MR. FISHER*

It would depend on what they were,

8 but here there is nothing.

It just doesn't follow.

Many

9 churches, as the Court well knows, are hierarchically
10 structured, non-democratic kinds of organizations, and just
11 mere membership accords nothing, and of course membership
12 isn't even defined in the statute.

We don't know if this is

13 occasional congregants, true believers, card-carriers, or
14 what.
15

I mean, there is no reference in here.

Well, now, I have changed it from fact

If that was the premise of the legislature,

10 that most churches raise their money from their members, and
11 as Justice White suggested, then the members are going to

12 conduct their own surveillance of the use of that money,
13 but that they are looking at people who claim religion
14 clause exemptions where perhaps they have 1 or 2 percent
15 raised from the membership and the balance raised from doing
16 what was done in the Hari Krishna case last year in this
17 Court, soliciting on the street and in public places.
18

Do you think the legislature would not be entitled

19 to address that problem?

20

KR. FISHER*

Well, it is certainly entitled to

21 address the problem, but again, when it draws lines, putting
22 churches into different categories, we have to look to the
23 premise and the facts that support this differential
24 treatment, and if there was proof that there was
25 self-regulation, that satisfies part of the problem, but

There is no explanation

whatsoever for this odd jerrymander line that is tied to an

You could raise tens of millions of dollars from

22 may apply to any church?
23

MR. FISHER;

To take the exemption, I mean, to go

24

the other way and to take the exemption away from all

25

churches, making them all subject to this law, I think,

36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

2 problems, and I think it --

a

3

QUESTION*

Well, at least it would be treating

4 churches evenhandedly with all other charitable
5 organizations.
6

MR. FISHER;

Well, I think that with all due

7 respect it may be better for a legislature to make the
8 determination that all churches are going to be regulated
9 than for a court to do that, and I think the legislative
10 history, scant as it is, and it is before the Court, makes
11 clear that the legislature did not want to, in the words of

12 one legislator, did not want to "mess around" with some
13 churches, and they were careful to make sure that this was
14 written in a way that would exclude the Catholic
15 Archdiocese, but on the other hand make sure that the
16 exemption was taken away from others.

There are references

17 in the legislative history to that.

18

I don't think they intended to bring in the

19 Catholics and the Lutherans and the Protestants and the

20 other groups, but perhaps the Court could enter such an
21 order, but it would not be popular.
22

QUESTION*

In the case of a federal court

23 reviewing a state statute, do you think it is entirely at
24 liberty if it concludes one portion of a statute is
25 unconstitutional to either strike down that provision or to

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

extend the provision in a way that it believes would make

2 the whole statute constitutional?

MR. FISHERs

3

I think that the Court perhaps would

4

have that option.

I think, though, in selecting an option

5

of relief, both the district court and the court of appeals

6 were correct in treating it
7

the way they did, which put it

to a status quo, leaving the entire Charitable Solicitation

8 Act intact as it was extant until
9

1978, when this amendment

came in.
It also, I think, was perhaps judicious of the

10
11

district court to rule just on this one issue, because this

12

law was also challenged on free speech, standardless

13

licensing, vagueness, and many other issues challenging the

14

law across the board in its application to any charity or

15

religion or non-profit organization, and the court ruled

16

just very narrowly on the establishment clause issue,

17

leaving the rest of the statute intact and enforceable as to

18

others.

19

So, I mean, there are options.

MR. FISHER;

22

QUESTION;

23

MR. FISHER;

Until they attack it.
Excuse me?
Until they attack it.
Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

I just don't

24

think that there is any necessary correlation, as I was

25

saying before, between the amount of money that a given

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

organization collects from the public and the percentage of

2 that organization's total that comes from the

public.

A

3 million dollars can be 10 percent, 80 percent, 5 percent.
4 There is just no correlation.
5

QUESTION;

6

MR. FISHER;

Your Honor, I think that --

No correlation with what?
There is no correlation between the

7 abstract proportion, this member-public contributions, and
8 correlation

with the amount of money that is collected from

9 the public.

In other words, looking at the ratio, if you

10 saw that it

was 40, 60 percent or whatever, wouldn't tell

11

you anything about what the impact on the public is.

12

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you had conceded in

13 response to Justice White's questions ten minutes ago, more
14 or less, that there is a certain assurance to the public
15 that if a large part, without putting a fixed figure on it,
16 if a large part of the support comes from the membership,
17 that then there is reasonable assurance that the
18 surveillance of the church's, the organization's activities
19 is ongoing.

21

Do you suggest that is not a reasonable subject

inquiry now?
MR. FISHER;

No, I did not — that may be a

of inquiry, to see if that is really

23 true, or you know, if it logically follows, or it follows as
24 a matter of fact.
25 presented here.

It is certainly not here.

It is not

It is something that was thought of —

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 There just isn't anything in this case that -2

QUESTION:

It can be advanced in support of the

3 legitimacy of the legislation, may it not?
4

MR. FISHER;

Yes, and I think that if it stands on

5 logic or reason, on its own, without requiring any facts,
6 then maybe the Court, you know, is free to embrace that, but
7 here it is completely speculative.

I suggest that it isn't

8 true, that there is no reason to believe that a 49 percent
9 membership group as opposed to a 51 will have any more power
10 or access, any more inclination, any more desire, or will be
11

just more likely to have access to anything -- we are

12 talking about mere members — than those on the other side
13 of the line.
14
15

I think it is interesting, too, that there was an
amendment, you could see, following the legislative history,

16 to, one, the treatment of groups other than religious, and
17

one regarding religious.

The one regarding other than

18

religions said that to be exempt you have to have 100

19

percent come from members, but not just any members.

20 must be real control members.

They

They must be voting members.

21

And there was a provision for voting members in an early

22

draft of the religion one, and you know, that was taken out,

23

and it was taken out during a colloquy that said, you know,

24

if we leave that in as to voting members, that is going to

25

mean that the Catholic Archdiocese and other hierarchical,

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 non-democratically organized groups are going to lose
2 theirs, and we don't want to mess around with them, so we
3 had better take that voting requirement out.
4

So we know that it is just rank members, and we

5 don't even know, again, what that means in the context of
6 this statute.

And I think that there is a — this

QUESTION:

That's right.

When it was enacted --

Well, I just -- I thought you had

25 forgotten that.

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. FISHER.-

1

No

I

mean, when it was initially

2 enacted 17 years before the amendment, it focused on
3 charities, just like other states have charitable
4 solicitation statutes.

It is this amendment, which is

5 unprecedented in the country, save for the North Carolina
6 amendment, which was found unconstitutional by the North
7 Carolina Supreme Court in the Heritage Village case
8 recently.

It is unprecedented, and I don’t think there has

9 been a case before this Court where a legislature actually
10 sits down and decides that some churches are going to be
11

regulated and others aren't, and setting out some very

12 substantial regulatory burdens that some, but not others,
13 are going to have -- be saddled with.
QUESTION;

14
15

You would agree, though, would you not,

that a state can properly pass a reasonable disclosure law

16 applicable to all churches who solicit funds from the
17
18
19

public?

Would you agree with that?
MR. FISHER;

Well, I agree that this is possible.

I suspect that it could very well raise potential free

20 exercise problems, some entanglement problems or what have
21

you, depending on what that disclosure is and to whom and

22 what have you.

Certain things obviously are more sensitive

23

than others.

Internal church documents regarding doctrine,

24

membership lists, and this sort of thing, depending on what

25

followup is attached to the disclosure -- there could be

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 substantial problems.
2

QUESTION;

What about if the statute were confined

3 strictly to a church-sponsored retirement community?
4

MR. FISHER;

Well, I think that when you are

5 talking about the jugular of the lifeblood flow of funds for
6 the church's support, you are talking about one thing, as
7 this statute talks about.

When you are talking about the

8 charitable kinds of activities that churches often are
9 involved in, I think that that perhaps is another question,
10 and the — this law, though, goes to the question of
11 regulating the church support fund question itself.

Does

12 that answer the question?
13

QUESTION;

Yes.

14

MR. FISHER;

Again, I think that the legislative

15 history dramatically illustrates the potential risk when
16 there is line drawing that the legislature may be subject to
17 kind of — more likely to be influenced by the result or the

18 effect of where they draw the line, and I think that there
19 are some seven references in the legislative history to

20 let's make sure about the Catholic Archdiocese.
21 other hand,

On the

let's make sure that we get the people at the

22 airports, and -- and there is one comment that I think is
23 right on, the heart of the matter, by a Senator Celoff, who
24 says, let's make sure -- I mean, that this applies to those
25 institutions that are not substantial institutions in our

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 state, and there is also a reference to something like, why
2 are we so hot to get the Moonies?
3 there isn't anything else.

I mean, there — and

I mean, there is nothing that

4 tells you the reason for the legislation or anything, but
5 when it gets down to where to draw the line, there is some
6 concern, and I think that that just is more reason why the
7 Court should give this close scrutiny.
8

QUESTION;

In your view, is there any line that

9 could be drawn by the legislature that would sustain the
10 constitutionality of the ftct?
11

NR. FISHER;

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. FISHER:

I think that if -In place of the 50 percent.
Well, the problem with the 50 percent

14 is that there is just nothing that supports it in fact or
15 logic.

If there were, if there were findings and studies

16 where it really was shown that there was control by the
17 public, then it would be a harder case if and only if there

18 was some sort of real tying of the line to the impact on the
19 public.

In other words, here you have an abstract

20 proportion that doesn’t — really isn’t correlated, doesn’t
21 really relate to how much money is really being taken from

22 the public, because your interest is the public.

If it did

23 have some sort of a figure, and there were findings that
24 some kinds of groups would take care — that would be able
25 to self-police, to self-manage their solicitation practices

1 and their uses of -2

QUESTION:

Let me get back to the question.

Is

3 there a line that would be constitutional, in your view?
4
5 be.

MR. FISHER:

Well, there might be.

There might

I am not —
QUESTION:

Ten percent, 25 percent, 33 and a third

7 percent?
8

MR. FISHER:

Well, again, I am saying it is

9 possible, but it would depend on a real showing of, you
10 know, a meaningful line drawing that — where there is a
11 legitimate reason for distinguishing.

I think in many of

12 the Court’s cases where such line drawing may have been
13 allowed — I mean, Gillette allowed some under
14 inclusiveness.

I mean, there was analysis.

There were

15 reasons for upholding this, and I just don't think that
16 there are here, and that is really the crux of the matter.
17 I mean,

there is just nothing that really supports a lack of

18 evenhandedness.

In the Krishna case, in Hefron, I mean,

19 that was evenhandedness.

That was treating -- the problem

20 there was that the Krishnas perhaps were seeking some
21 special treatment.
22

QUESTION:

Wasn't the argument made when that

23 Minnesota case was here?

24

MR. FISHER:

Well, no.

But that would have been

25 perhaps the effect, and it was conceded, I think, in that

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

case by counsel, that they really didn’t -- in that

2 particular case they shouldn’t have a claim of special

3 treatment, but that would have been the effect, I think, of
4 a ruling, and the Court said this was a rule being
5 evenhandedly applied to everyone, the Booth requirement.
QUESTION:

6

7 question.
8

Well, I get back to Justice O'Connor’s

Suppose there weren’t any 50 percent limitation

here at all, just a complete requirement of reporting by

9 every church.

Would you object?

MR. FISHER:

10

Well, first of all, there is more

11

than just reporting here, but assuming that there was

12

evenhanded treatment, neutral treatment, then I think that

13 there would not be a neutrality problem, as we have argued,
14 but there would be an entanglement problem.

There would be,

15 I think -16

QUESTION:

In what respect?

All they have to do

17 is file reports, period.
18

MR. FISHER:

19

QUESTION:

Well, that is not this -Forget about all the other fringe

20 material which is in the statute.
21

MR. FISHER:

Right.

Okay.

Well, that fringe

22 material makes it plenty more than just disclosure.

If it

23 did, I think it would be obviously a much more difficult
24 case.
25

QUESTION:

Well, I would like you to address

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Justice O’Connor's question, which I think you still haven't
2 answered.
3

MR. FISHER;

4

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor.
And that is, as I recall it, whether

5 you would find unconstitutional a neutral reporting statute
6 without any percentage limitation in it.
7

MR. FISHER:

Without seeing it, but giving an

8 answer, a yes or no, I would say I would not find that
9 constitutional.

I would still have a problem with that,

10 even that type of law.
11

QUESTION;

Well, the court below indicated that it

12 would uphold exempting any organization, including a church,
13 if it raisad all of its money from its members.
14

MR. FISHER;

That also would be a more difficult

15 case.
16

QUESTION:

But that would distinguish between

17 churches, those that raise all their money from members and
18 churches that don't raise all their money from members.
19

MR. FISHER:

20

QUESTION:

That's correct.

That’s correct.

So you would disagree with the court

21 below in that respect?
22

MR. FISHER:

23

QUESTION:

I have problems with that, yes.
Well, but if the court below, though,

24 it seems to me, would have sustained the law if it
25 distinguished between churches on that basis, and yet they

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

10

MR. SALUSTRO*

The argument has been made here

11 that our provision, the criteria has to be supported by a
12 factual inquiry.

What was done below was, on summary

13 judgment, this provision was declared facially
14 unconstitutional as to all religious organizations.

It is

15 not up to us on their motion for summary judgment to supply
16 facts that support our criterion and the 50 percent part of
17 it.
18

Furthermore, in their brief, they have

19 acknowledged that this statute has a rational basis, on Page

20 23 of their brief.
21 Gillette.

That is the standard that comes out of

If there is a secular criteria, if there is no

22 religious jerrymandering in the exemption, all we need is a
23 rational basis.

There is a secular criterion here.

24 is no jerrymander here.

There

And there isn't a jerrymander

25 because of these references to legislative history and what
