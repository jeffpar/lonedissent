CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

5

MR. TRIBE;

6 may
7

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

it please the Court.
This case brings to the Court a judgment of

8 the California

Court of Appeal upholding an amendment to

9 the California Constitution.

Proposition One enacted a

10 special statewide election to, and I quote from
11

the

analysis of the Legislative Analyst, "limit the power of

12 California Courts to require desegregation."

13

Proposition One expressly linked —

14

QUESTION*

That was written in terms of

15 limited as between the California standards or the
16 federal standards?
17

HR. TRIBE;

Clearly they wanted to link it to

18 the federal standards.

What is- intriguing about the

19 case is whether it is permissible for a state, in its
20 constitution which provides generous protection for
21 educational equality across the board, to single out the

22 right not to be subject to what the California Courts
23 have called racial isolation, and to single it out by
24 saying that as to that right, the only remedies
25 available are those that a Federal Court, in the same

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 circumstances, would order
2

We submit that that is not permissible, and the

3 Petitioners in this case —
4

QUESTIOHx

Isn't the corollary to that that

5 states must have the same standards as the federal?
6

MB. TPIBE:

7

QUESTIONS

No, not at all, Mr. Chief Justice.
It is a ratchet that only goes one

8 way ?
9

MB. TBIBE:

If the states wanted to cut back on

10 their equal protection clause in a neutral way, and to
11 say, in general, they will not go beyond the federal
12 Constitution, that would surely be permissible.

The

13 State of California has not done that.
14

The State of California, as the decision below

15 expressly holds, continues to create rights to be free
16 of racially segregated schooling regardless of cause
17 broader than the rights that are conferred under federal
18 law.

The rights, substantively, have been completely

19 unchanged by Proposition One.

Moreover, the court below

20 held that the duty on the school board to take
21 affirmative steps, including mandatory pupil
22 reassignment if and when necessary, remains.
23

What is now different, and it is different only

24 with respect to desegregation, not with respect to
25 school finance or any other area.

What is different is

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that with respect to school desegregation now, after

2 Proposition One, one cannot use the Courts of California
3

to get any and all necessary remedies.

4

oneself to those remedies that a federal court, with all

5

of the institutional limits on federal courts, would

One must limit

6 order in that very case.
7

9

QUESTION;

Is it analogous to a State

Norris-LaGuardia Act?
MR. TRIBE:

It is analogous, I think, to a

10

state racially specific Norris LaGuardia Act that says

11

in, for example, racial labor disputes, as opposed to

12

other labor disputes, the state courts cannot enter

13

certain remedies unless federal courts would do so.

14

It seems to me that the closest analogy is

15

really in this case clearly Hunter v. Erickson, but in a

16

way this case is a lot worse than Hunter v. Erickson for

17

this reason:

18

sort of education that the petitioners, the minority

19

students of Los Angeles, are receiving or will receive

20

as a result of Proposition One.

21

world, but the legal issue here is somewhat narrower.

22

What is important in this case is not the

That matters in the

The legal issue here is not even the degree of

23

racial isolation and separation to which petitioners

24

will be fated by virtue of Proposition One.

25

is the special way in which Proposition One creates a

The issue

1

two-track judicial system in California, a dual court

2 system in which only those seeking redress from racial
3

isolation in violation of state law must be satisfied

4

with less than full relief from a state court.

5

They must, instead, persuade the school board,

6 which is typically the defendant in the case, the entity
7

said to be in default of their continuing obligations

8 under state law, that the school board has been remiss
9
10

11
12

in not ordering certain remedies.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, the proposition doesn't

forbid a school board from voluntarily desegregating?
MR. TRIBE:

No, and indeed, Justice White, that

13

is one of the reasons it is so plain that it is a racial

14

specific classification.

15
16
17
18
19

QUESTION:

So it is different from the

Washington.
MR. TRIBE:

It bears almost no resemblance, in

our view, to the Washington case.
QUESTION:

But if the school board hasn't any

20 duty to desegregate, you agree with that I gather, if
21

22

there isn't de jure.
MR. TRIBE:

Under state law, Justice White, it

23

may have a duty even without de jure and that

24

continues.

25

QUESTION:

Except for the proposition.

6

1

MR. TRIBE:

2

QUESTION:

Although the court below —
The proposition removes the duty

3 that the Supreme Court of California said was —
MR. TRIBE:

4

Justice White, I don't think so.

5 If I may quote from the court below at page 510 of the
6

California Reporter version —
QUESTION:

7
8

Where is it in the petition for

certiorari—

9
10 the

MR. TRIBE:

In the petition for

cert,

in

— could I have that for a moment?

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. TRIBE:

I agree, it —
If I could just read, it is a very

13 brief passage. Justice Renquist, so let me read it.
14

"This right," the court is talking about the

15 broader right,

"recognized in Crawford has not been

16 removed by Proposition One,

which does not purport to

17 change the duty —
18

QUESTION:

I agree with you, under state law.

19

MR. TRIBE:

20

So what we have here is not the destruction of

— under state.

21 a right or the changing of a duty, as this court held
22 only last month in Laverne.

The fact that a state may

23 be free to remove a right or remove a duty,

does not

24 mean that it has the same freedom to leave the right in
25 place but simply, in a discriminatory way we argue,

7

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

provide less than full judicial remedy.

2

The way Proposition One is written, it

3

distinguishes — it singles out, let me quote from the

4

Solicitor General, I think there is an accurate

5

rendition of it in this brief, "It singles out a right

6 afforded California school children under state law,
7

admittedly, to attend schools free of racial isolation,

8 whatever the cost, and subjects that right to an unusual
9

judicial process that makes its protection substantially

10

more difficult than protection of other state rights.

11

For example -QUESTION*

12

What you would say. Hr. Tribe, if

13

the proposition had said that it just removes all the

14

duty that was found in Crawford to desegregate, even if

15

it was de facto?
MR. TRIBE;

16

It cuts the right back completely.

17

It would be a very different and more difficult, Justice

18

White.

19

There would still be one argument -QUESTION*

It is really a lot different — That

20 is a lot different than what they did.
21

They say, you

may have a duty but it is just completely unenforceable

22 in the court.
23

MR. TRIBE;

Tou are supposed to try to enforce

24

it by going to the other side.

25

with the other team.

The referee is replaced

1

QUESTION;

The way it reads, you think now, if

2 the Crawford and the Crawford rule still stands, there
3 is nothing

that a school board can do but to

4 desegregate?
5

MR. TRIBE;

They are under an obligation, a

6 duty to desegregate.

7

QUESTION;

Exactly.

8

MR. TRIBE;

But there is nothing one can do to

9 review in the Courts of California.
10
11

QUESTION;

To say that they are voluntarily

doing it is beside the point.

They have a duty to do

12 it ■

MR. TRIBE;

13
14 it.

They supposedly have a duty to do

But now, unlike other state duties, this one can't

15 be enforced
16

in the Courts of California.

QUESTION;

As a practical matter, isn't it

17 sensible to say that a right without a remedy really
18 isn't a

right, and that the conclusion Justice White

19 suggests is true, that the right is gone for all
20 practical purposes?
21

MR. TRIBE;

Justice Renguist, there are two

22 answers that I have to that.
23 court's approach,

The first is that in this

for example, to procedural due process

24 cases, it has drawn a sharp distinction between the
25 state's destruction of an interest and the state's

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

statement to someone, "You have this interest property,"

2 let us say,
3

"but we will not give you any hearing to

protect it."
This court has said, it is a matter of

4

5 Fourteenth Amendment law —

Once the state confers and

6 continues to protect the right by saying that you have
7 it,

it is a matter of Fourteenth Amendment law what

8 remedies are adequate for its enforcement.

I want to make this second point.

9

Even if it

10 were true that the State of California had taken the
11

further step, which it denies it has taken and which the

12 court below denies,
13 segregation

and had surgically removed racial

from the list of wrongs in the educational

14 world as to which California law

provides a more

15 generous standard by not inquiring into cause,
16 allowing a broad range of remedies,
17 inter-district remedies,

including

that would truly have been the

18 withdrawal on a race specific basis,
19 basis, of one right and one

20 me,
21

22

and by

not on a neutral

right only.

That seems to

under Hunter v. Erickson, this court is not

necessarily prepared to counternance.
QUESTIONS

Then it really is a ratchet because

23 the state can give more and more consideration to
24 desegregation policies going beyond
25 the Constitution,

the requirements of

but it can never go back.

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. TRIBEs

I think that is not right, Justice

2 Renquist, it can go back.
3 something specially
4 could
5

If the state were to do

for race, we do not deny that it

take that back.
If the state were to say, equal educational

6 opportunity
7 is denied,

across-the-board is crucial, so that when it
we don't care if it is de facto or de jure,

8 and were to give that broad panoply of rights, and then
9 were to say, but now we are going to take it back from
10 one group,
11
12

racial minorities, that would raise a

different problem.
It is not a one-way ratchet.

It is simply that

13 if the state decides to take something back

from

14 minorities only, when it has given on a broader basis,
15 that raises a facially racial classification.
16

QUESTION*

17 on a broader basis?
18 minorities,
19

How can you say that Crawford gave
What it gave was a right to

was it not?

MR. TRIBEs

No, I don't think so because

20 Crawford relied also on Serrano v. Priest in which the
21

California Court had compared its approach expressly in

22 the areas of inequality of school finance and racial
23 inequality.

It had said that it saw no reason to treat

24 them differently.
25

The federal court, out of reason of deference

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

to the states, the federal court might, for example, not

2 want to provide inter-district remedies, but there is no
3

reason for the states to worry about deferring to

4

themselves.

5

of causation, but as far as state law was concerned

The federal courts might worry about proof

6 equality of educational opportunity, when education was
7

made a fundamental right in California, was so basic

8 that it really diin't matter whether there was a
9

deliberate decision to deny equality.
So the earlier Crawford decision, building on a

10
11

decision that the California Supreme Court called

12

Jackson —

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. TRIBE:

Jackson was before Serrano?
That is right, and then Serrano

15

relied on Jackson and said, "Re think that it is a broad

16

principle of California's fundamental rights law with

17

respect to education."
But in any event, I think it is important to

18
19

get back to the point that here it is not just a denial

20 of a right.
21

Indeed, the court below rejected the

petitioner's attempt to show that one of the things that

22 was wrong here was that a vested right might have been
23

taken away.

The court below said, "No, the right is the

24

same.

25

can't be fully enforced.”

It is just that this right, unlike other rights,

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

In Hunter v. Erickson, the crucial racial

1

2 distinction that was drawn, as the court pointed out,
3

was not between blacks and whites, not between various

4

groups of people, religious or racial.

5

distinction that was drawn, the court said, was between

The crucial

6 racial housing matters and other racial and housing
7

8
9

matters.
So that the example that this court gave was
that those people, for example, who wanted to pass rent

10

control laws, or laws increasing protection from

11

negligent landlords or building codes, had an easier

12

time vindicating their goals through the state’s legal

13

system than did those people who wanted to end racial

14

discrimination in housing.

15

What this measure does, without any doubt, on

16

its face since it refers to school integration, when

17

talking about what school boards can voluntarily do —

18

what it does without any doubt is create a special

19

obstacle, not just to translating goals of racial

20 equality into not yet existent law that doesn’t apply
21

elsewhere, but a special obstacle to vindicating state

22 created rights of racial equality which does not apply
23

when one is trying to vindicate state created rights of

24

educational equality in the financial area, in decisions

25

like Serrano.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

I do not think, that it is right to say that

1

2 racial animus must be shown in a case like this.
3

Indeed, in Washington v. Davis itself, this court

4

approvingly cited Hunter v. Erickson for the proposition

5

that when a law on its face creates a racial

6

classification that imposes a greater obstacle to racial

7

minorities, or to minority rights, than it does in other

8

analogous areas, at that point one doesn't need to take

9

the next step and show discriminatory intent.
Indeed, Justice Powell in his Bakke decision

10
11

distinguished Arlington v. Heights from an explicit

12

racial classification.

13

Fourteenth Amendment purposes is the intent to treat

14

race differently.
QUESTION:

15

The only relevant intent for

Mr. Tribe, isn't it at least

16

possible that the Proposition One could affect other

17

types of plaintiffs who would seek busing to remedy a

18

problem?

19

For instance, if California recognized some

20 right of the handicapped to have an equal educational
21

opportunity, and there were only one school that

22 provided that kind of benefit, and plaintiffs might seek
23

busing to afford that remedy, would this proposition

24

affect that possibly?

25

MB. TRIBE:

Justice O'Connor, my view is, based

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

on the decision below, that it would not.

At least

2 seven times, the Court of Appeal in this case said that
3

Proposition One restricts the use of California’s Courts

4

for pupil reassignment only for purposes of

5

desegregation.

1

The school board itself its opposition to

2 certiorari in this Court said at page 9 that Proposition
3 One addresses but one narrow area, the power of a state
4 court to order student assignment as a desegregation
5 remedy.

The other Respondent in this case puts that as

6 the question presented, whether a race specific remedy
7 is even permissible under the Constitution.
8

QUESTION;

Mr. Tribe, I gather the judgment of

9 the court whose judgment we are reviewing said that they
10 set aside the findings of discriminatory intent?

11

MR. TRIBE:

There were no findings below,

12 because the trial judge in this case thought that since
13 a federal court would have ordered desegregation
14 Proposition One didn't matter.
15

QUESTION:

In any event, the Court of Appeals

16 thought there was no discriminatory intent.
17

MR. TRIBE:

That's right.

The Court of

18 Appeals didn't conduct any hearings —
19

QUESTION;

So that you must convince us that

20 such findings are not necessary in this case.
21

MR. TRIBE;

Well, there are two ways that we

22 can win in this case, Justice White.

One is to convince

23 you that since this is an explicit racial classification
24 which imposes an obstacle to the vindication of minority
25 rights, intent is irrelevant.

We believe that's clearly

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2
3
4
5

right and I want to refer to it.
QUESTION:

Even — you wouldn't even say that

that is eguivalent to discriminatory intent?
MR. TRIBE:

Well, discriminatory in the sense

of intent to have a disparate and adverse impact on a

6 racial minority, not necessarily out of animus and not
7

simply as opposed to sleepwalking, but in the sense that

8 it’s not just a statistical connection with race.
9

Obviously, when race is present on the face of the law

10

-- we're not dealing with an Arlington Heights situation

11

or a Washington v. Davis situation, in which a seemingly

12

innocent act happens to have an adverse impact on a

13

racial group.

14

When you have explicit racial classification,

15

as you do here, the relevant purpose is already

16

conclusively demonstrated.

17

QUESTION:

18

that you have here?

19

What is the racial classification

NR. TRIBE:

The racial classification here is

20 between rights to reduce racial inequality in California
21

schools and other rights relating to the educational

22 system in California.
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Where do you find that in the

ini tia tive?
MR. TRIBE:

The initiative specifically says

17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that it shall not be construed to prevent a school board
2 from engaging voluntarily in integration.

So that this

3 initiative deals with integration on its face,
4 integration and desegregation.
5

At the same time, the official legislative

6 analysis that accompanied it stated that its concern was
7 desegregation.

The Solicitor General says it is indeed

8 race specific in the sense that it’s focused on the
9 problem of racial isolation in California's schools.
10

But even if it were true that by accident a

11 law plainly designed on its face, since it speaks to
12 integration, to create special limits on the use of
13 California's courts in the desegregation area might
14 happen to have a spillover effect and might happen, I
15 would submit quite inadvertently, to interfere with
16 racial — with school assignments in the area of
17 handicapped or overcrowding, even if that were to happen
18 that would not in any way affect the proposition that a
19 clear and explicit line is nonetheless drawn between

20 racial inequality in California schools and, for
21 example, economic inequality, something the California
22 courts had treated as entirely analogous.
23

Justice Fehnquist asked in the Seattle case

24 whether it wasn't true,

in Hunter v. Erickson, that only

25 fair housing ordinances were subject to the referendum

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 requirement.

Well, indeed, it wasn’t quite true.

It

2 was argued by the City of Akron in its brief and it was
3 undisputed, in its brief in this Court, that some other
4 ordinances, including taxation ordinances, for example,
5 ordinances raising taxes, also had to be subjected to
6 referendum.
7

So it couldn’t be said literally that the line

8 put race and only race on one side and everything else
9 on the other.
10

QUESTION;

Well, this particular charter

11 amendment did, though.
12

MR. TRIBE;

This particular charter amendment

13 did, and we submit that the correct way of reading
14 Proposition One is that it doese and the court below so
15 read it.
16

But I was suggesting earlier that there was

17 another way to win this case, and I would like to turn
18 for a moment to that before I amplify the, we think,
19 serious and

rather unique constitutional defect in

20 Proposition One.

And that is, with respect to Arlington

21 Heights, not only was there no determination of any kind
22 about racially impermissible impact and purpose by the
23 trial court, because it didn't think Proposition One was
24 even

an issue in the case, but the Court of Appeals

25 conducted no inquiry remotely resembling what the Court

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 required in Arlington Heights.
2

The Court of Appeals said that it was a

3 sufficient answer to all of our allegations and all of
4 the evidence that we had yet to introduce to any
5 tribunal, but that is in this record, a sufficient
6 answer that in its face there was written into
7 Proposition One a non-racial purpose.
8

Well, my goodness, if that's all it takes to

9 satisfy Arlington Heights, if all you have to do is say
10 in the law,

we're not trying to do this because of race,

11 then Arlington Heights becomes a meaningless
12 precedent.
13

The Court of Appeals went on to say that

14 because the proposition could have been motivated by
15 considerations other than race, it would necessarily be
16 too speculative to conduct a hearing on how in fact it
17 was motivated.

Surely that's not the standard that this

18 Court laid down in Arlington Heights.
19

At a minimum, therefore, if the Court were not

20 to agree that this is an impermissible explicit racial
21 classification violative of Hunter, there would have to
22 he either a remand under Arlington Heights or a
23 determination that on this record this is so plainly
24 designed to restrict desegregation, not just to restrict
25 racial balance but to restrict the use of California's

1

courts to achieve desegregation, that it on its face is

2 impermissibly motivated, or that the evidence so clearly

3 shows it to be impermissibly motivated that you don't
4 need a further hearing.

But at least we would have been

5 entitled to a remand.
QUESTIQNi

6

You say that in face of the fact

7 that compliance with federal standards and federal
8 courts'

9

orders was implicit in the California No.
MR. TRIBEs

I say it not so much in the face

10 of that fact, but because of that fact.
11

1.

What is so

unusual, Mr. Chief Justice, is that, as this Court has

12 emphasized again and again,

typically it is when the

13 federal courts that are unavailable, for whatever
14 reason, for lack of standing or because of deference to
.15

the state courts, what is important is that when federal

16 courts are unavailable typically one can vindicate one's
17 rights, state as well as federal, in state court.
18

Now, when does Proposition One limit the

19 ability of a state court fully to vindicate one's rights
20 under state law?
21

Precisely when one couldn't get

vindication from a federal court.

In other words, this

22 revolving door begins to operate in a race specific way

23 exactly when you need the state courts the most.
24

QUESTIONt

Well, the reason you can't get

25 relief in the federal court, by your hypothesis, is

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

because no federal right is violated.
MR. TRIBE;

2

But Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in the

3

Valley Forge decision you did emphasize that even though

4

there might be a federal right. Article III imposes

5

independent and important limits on the federal courts.

6 The fact that you can't get relief from a federal court
7

may not in itself mean there's no substantive

8 violation.

QUESTION;

9

Well, certainly people who claimed

10

they were the victims of de jure segregation have had no

11

difficulty getting relief from the federal courts in the

12

past.
MR. TRIBE;

13

Certainly that's right, Justice

14

Rehnguist.

15

only effective relief from de jure segregation is an

16

inter-district remedy that this Court under Milliken,

17

partly out of deference to the state courts, would not

18

be willing to give.

19

Proposition One would have had no reluctance to do it.
QUESTION;

20
21

But, number one, it might wall be that the

And yet a California court prior to

That's an example of a case where

you don't have any federal right.
MR. TRIBE;

22

But the reason perhaps that you

23

don't have any federal right is deference to states'

24

rights.

25

deference to states’ rights the reason for states to

1

close their doors
But what about de facto segregation?

2

3 California has chosen in the area of education to say
4 what this Court, partly out of institutional and
5 federal-state concern, was unwilling to say in
6 Rodriguez,

that education is a fundamental right,

7 therefore that you don't need to show deliberate denial
8 of equality as a matter of California law.

The failure to show that would prevent one

9

10 from getting federal relief in school finance cases and
11

in desegregation cases.

But it's only in desegregation

12 cases that it would have the further effect of now

13 requiring that in order to get relief from the
14 illegality you have to persuade the other side, the
15 school board that is in default of its duties under
16 state law,

that it must do something for you, and if you

17 don't persuade them that's the end of it.
18

It's very much like what the Court observed

19 was unconstitutional in Boddie v.

Connecticut.

That is,

20 when the state makes it impossible for you to vindicate
21

your rights without full resort to the state judicial

22 system, but then cuts off that resort to the state
23 judicial system,

it is violating your rights under the

24 Fourteenth Amendment.
25

Now, that was true in Boddie v. Connecticut

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

partly because a fundamental federal right was

2 involved.

The analogue in this case of that fundamental

3 federal right is that the limitation on access to courts
4 is race specific.

The line surely is drawn between

5 desegregation and school finance even if it turns out
6 that there's no line drawn between desegregation and
7 problems of handicapped.

But we submit that the belated suggestion by

8

9 the school board,
10 litigation,
11

for the first time in this entire

that perhaps Proposition One wasn't directed

just to desegregation, that perhaps it was directed at

12 problems of handicapped and overcrowding as well, is
13 utterly and facially incredible.
14

Never in the history of this litigation until

15 the filing of the most recent round of briefs in this
16 Court has it been suggested by the school board, by any
17 other Respondent, that Proposition One has nothing to do
18 with race.

Indeed, if that were true there would have

19 been a very simple answer for the Court of Appeals to
20 give to the Hunter v. Erickson argument.
21

When we argued to the Court of Appeals that

22 this was a race specific obstacle to the enforcement of
23 rights, in violation of Hunter versus Erickson,

it would

24 have said presumably, no, we don't construe it as being
25 race specific at all.

But instead the court below said,

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 how could it be a violation of your federal rights when
2 it explicitly embraces the Fourteenth Amendment?

That

3 was the only answer to the Hunter versus Erickson
4 argument below.
5

He submit that when rights of racial equality

6 are reduced in a state's law to what the Fourteenth
7 Amendment as enforced by federal courts would do, while
8 analogous rights are more generously treated, it is no
9 answer to say that the Fourteenth Amendment is good
10 enough for the federal courts and it had therefore
11 better be good enough for minorities as well.
12

QUESTION;

Doesn't that add up to the

13 proposition that once the state has given some right it
14 can’t take it away?
15

MR. TRIBEs

I don’t think so, Mr. Chief

16 Justice.

It can take it away as long as it does not do

17 so on a race specific basis.

For example, if the State

18 of California had taken a view analogous to that of this
19 Court in Rodriguez about school finance and had just
20 said in the one limited area of race that we will no
21 longer worry about whether something is de jure and de
22 facto, we will give a broader set of rights, and had
23 then taken that back either by judicial decision or by
24 constitutional change,

we would not be in this Court

25 arguing that that was a race specific change.

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

It might be race specific in the trivial sense

2 that when you give something to members of a minority
3

race and then take it back that's race specific by

4

definition.

5

decisions show, equated that with a racial

But this Court has not, as the Dayton

6 classification.
7

That's very different from saying across the

8 board in the educational realm, we will confer broader
9

rights and now we'll take them back from minorities

10

alone.

11

submit it does more, because what it does is say, you

12

all have all of these rights, they're wonderful, they're

13

like a teasing illusion — a munificent bequest in a

14

pauper's will. Justice Jackson once called it — because

15

although you have these rights the only way you can

16

vindicate them is by persuading the person who's in

17

default of its obligation with respect to these rights,

18

the school board, that it should voluntarily confess

19

error and make correction.

20
21

This law clearly at least does that, and we

QUESTIONi

Nell, what if California had

construed its constitution more liberally in a number of

22 respects, say the rights of criminal defendants,
23

property rights and that sort of thing, and then decided

24

that it would retreat in the area of education, which

25

did involve the Crawford type right, but also involved

26

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Serrano type right?
MR. TRIBE:

2

I think education is a broad and

3

neutral enough category that it would not be race

4

specific.

5

QUESTION:

Even though that was the only one

6 where minorities were involved?
7

MR. TRIBE:

It seems to me that would be a

8 statistical overlap, as between veterans and males in
9

Feny, and we would then have to prove discriminatory

10

intent.

11

it draws a line between integration — that word, I

12

remind the Court, is present in Proposition One itself

13

— when it draws a line between integration and other

14

forms of equalization within education, then we don’t

15

have to worry about why in the world did they pick

16

education, was it because minorities are involved

17

there?

18

21

Clearly, the focus of this law on its face is
desegregation.
But I want to say, before reserving some time
for rebuttal, that it’s important to put this case in

22 its right context.

This is not a case, it seems to me,

23

about desegregation or schooling as such.

It is a case

24

about the fundamental question of whether a state may

25

structure its court system so that we have a system of

1 dual courts, courts fully capable of remedying, with the
2 full panoply of necessary remedies, rights that relate
3 to education, unless those rights involve claims of
4 racial equality.
5

This Court in 1963 in the case of Johnson

6 against Virginia held that racially segregated
7 courtrooms are per se unconstitutional.

This courthouse

8 itself was segregated for some years after Brown v.
9 Board of Education.
10

Bad as it was to relegate minorities to the

11 back of the bus under the Jim Crow laws of the old
12 South, we submit that it is even worse to relegate
13 minorities to the back of the courthouse under the more
14 subtle laws of the new North.

We believe that this law

15 does just that.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF G. WILLIAM SHEA, ESQ.

18
19

Mr. Shea?

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. SHEA:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

20 the Court:
21

Throughout the course of this lengthy

22 litigation, the Petitioners have always asserted that
23 the decisions of this Court and the lower courts in the
24 federal system, as well as the equal protection clause
25 of the Fourteenth Amendment, should be controlling.

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Proposition One accepts that argument by making all of

2 those the governing standard in California.

I submit that the key to the constitutionality

3

4 of this Proposition
5

One is the very adoption of the

requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment equal

6 protection clause in the decisions of this Court.
7 the provisions of One

All

-- and I’ll take them up in a

8 minute — yield to the supremacy of the federal
9 Constitution,

and Proposition One has no racial

10 classification in it.
11

How, let me first of all turn, because of the

12 remarks of counsel for the
13 explain.

Petitioners — I want to

He said specifically that the court below did

14 not address itself

to the issue of whether it was race

15 specific.

I can understand that a new argument is being

16 made here,

and it is a new argument, and that is, and

17 that's the only

reason I bring it up, that is why the

18 Court of Appeals did
19 was argued below to
20

not address itself when the case
any charge of being race specific.

There were two issues argued below.

21 that the findings of the court,

One was

the trial court in 1970,

22 which contrary to the statement that has just been made
23 were incorporated by the trial judge in

the decision

24 which led to the Court of Appeal decision.
25 decision on

The 1980

Proposition One, incorporated those same

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

1970 findings.
And I call the Court's attention to the fact

2
3

that from pages 11 to 49 of the opinion of the court

4

below in the appendix to the petition for certiorari,

5

that's an entire discussion of those findings, with the

6 conclusion being set forth that those findings did not
7

constitute a de jure violation by this school board

8 under the decisions of this Court.

So that was the point that was first made

9
10

below.

The balance of that opinion, commencing on page

11

50, solely dealt with the constitutionality of

12

Proposition One.

13

classification is new and being raised for the first

14

time in this Court.

So the argument of racial

15

And I submit that if you look, at the language

16

of Proposition One — and I'm referring particularly to

17

the response that counsel for Petitioners made to

18

Justice O'Connor's question — it is the position of the

19

school district that Proposition One in its language

20 does not limit, does not limit its reach either in the
21

constitutional restraint on the state and the invoking

22 of the Fourteenth Amendment or in the provision
23

restraining the state courts unless there's a Fourteenth

24

Amendment violation and a decision which would support

25

the remedy involved.

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

It is not limited to school desegregation

2 cases.

Nowhere — and I'm looking at the first page of

3

the proposition as it appears in the appendix to our

4

brief in this Court — nowhere is there any limitation

5

that, for example, would not involve overcrowding of

6 schools or handicapped children, in the illustration
7

8
9

given .
And then Petitioners' counsel finds what in
Proposition One to establish it’s race specific?

He

10

turns to the proviso clause, which says that nothing in

11

it, nothing in One, shall prevent a school board from

12

using, any California school board, from using mandatory

13

busing or reassignment of students in a school

14

segregation problem.

15

So he takes that and lifts it to the whole

16

Proposition One and says, there is your race specific.

17

Or he goes another way and he says, look at the court

18

section, the restraint on the court section.

19

remedy - a court in California can only use mandatory

Only to

20 assignment of students or transportation of those
21

students to remedy a specific violation of what?

A

22 violation of the equal protection clause of the
23

Fourteenth Amendment, and impose a remedy which would be

24

permitted under a federal court interpreting that

25

violation and applying a remedy.

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

From that he urges this Court to say that this

2 is a racial classification because it sets up a
3 two-tier, a second class court system in California.
4

If California in Proposition One does so, I

5 submit, only gives the courts in that one instance the
6 same powers that you give the lower federal courts, that
7 is hardly creating a second class judicial system,
8 because that has been created by the decisions of this
9 Court under the Fourteenth Amendment.
10

QUESTION»

Mr. Shea, in your view if Congress

11 should take away federal jurisdiction to use busing as a
12 remedy would the California courts be deprived of the
13 power to do the same thing, even when there's a
14 violation of the federal Constitution?
15

ME. SHEA:

Justice Stevens, I would have to

16 look at that bill, but I would have grave doubts as to
17 the constitutionality if Congress tried to take away a
18 decision — the right of the federal courts to redress a
19 Fourteenth Amendment violation, if that was needed under
20 the circumstances, as was said in the Swann case, needed
21 in order to bring about the desegregation.
22

QUESTION:

As I read Proposition One, the

23 measure of the power that's left to the California
24 courts is it's equal to what a federal court could
25 order.

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. SHEA s

I so agree.

2

QUESTION;

So any cutting back on the federal

3 court power it seems to me

would automatically also

4 affect the power of your courts, even if there were a
5 federal constitutional violation.
6

MR. SHEA;

Well, I would say yes, because the

7 parity would be there.

I can't deny that.

8

QUESTION;

But you question whether —

9

MR. SHEA:

But I question the propriety under

10 the Constitution and the separation of
11

powers.

I

wouldn’t want to get into that big problem, but I would

12 question whether that could be properly done.

So in

13 evaluating whether we have got an inferior court system,
14 I just don't think
15

that's a real possibility.

But I would go one step further in my position

16 on the state courts as to where they stand now under the
17 Proposition One.

They are still in a position to do

18 more than the federal courts can,

because the other

19 tools that this Court well knows that are used in
20 desegregating schools,
21

in relieving racial imbalance —

magnet schools, voluntary transfers, changes in

22 teacher-pupil ratios,

enriched curricula — those are

23 still obligations.
24

They are still obligations and, as we have

25 pointed out in our brief, at the present time in Los

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Angeles we have Plan Four working which was put into
2 effect in the fall of last year, after the decision
3 below had been made and the California Supreme Court on
4 March 11, 1981, the same court, made up of almost the
5 same personnel that decided Crawford One, declined to
6 review those two key points in the decision below, that
7 there was no de jure violation and that Proposition One
8 was constitutional.
9

QUESTION*

Are you saying that the courts can

10 do more, that the state courts can do more, or that the
11 state school boards can do more?
12

MR. SHEA;

Well, the state school board can do

13 even more, because they can use the transportation
14 assignment under the proviso clause.
15

QUESTION;

Well, can a state court do anything

16 in the absence of a finding of de jure segregation?
17

MR. SHEA*

I think they can, because contrary

18 — and I would agree with counsel for the Petitioner, I
19 think the question was asked what the Court of Appeals
20 lid and that's where we stand now below — it did not
21 say that Crawford One, the decision which first carved
22 out the state right for de facto relief of racially
23 imbalanced schools.

In the decision below at page 54 in

24 the same reporting in the appendix of the petition for
25 certiorari, they did say that that obligation remained.

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Justice Rehnquist, if that obligation remained

2 then the courts could order the establishment, if they
3 did need to, establishment of a magnet school, or they
4 could order other things, as long as it did not involve
5 the reassignment or transportation on a mandatory basis
6 of the pupils.
7

QUESTION:

So that when you qualify it that

8 way it seems to me that it is almost entirely left up to
9 the school boards, because of the language in
10 Proposition One that in enforcing this subdivision or
11 any other provision of this constitution, no court of
12 this state may impose upon the State of California or
13 any public entity, board or official any obligation or
14 responsibility with respect to the use of pupil school
15 assignment or pupil transportation.
16

Now, what can a court do in the light of that

17 prohibition?
18

MR. SHEA:

Well,

I assume, for example, if

19 they did not — we have established magnet schools.

But

20 assume that a school board did not establish them and a
21 parent or somebody wanted a magnet school, and so they
22 asked the school board to do it and they did not do so.
23 And that being recognized as a tool, they could sue and
24 ask the court to enforce the —
25

QUESTION:

Well, wouldn’t that be concerning

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 pupil assignment?
2
3 voluntary.

MR. SHEA:

No, because magnets are all

The school could be established, but the

4 attendance would not have to be compelled.
5

QUESTION:

The court would order a school

6 established, but it —
7

MR. SHEA:

It could do so.

I'm not saying so,

8 because I would hope that other school districts would
9 emulate us, where we have established magnet schools and
10 where we now have an ongoing program.

But all I meant

11 to bring out is that there is implicit in Proposition
12 One a broader power in the state courts in that sense
13 than even a federal court would have.
14

But the attendance would be simply voluntary.

15

The racial classification argument, which I

16 think as I heard counsel is relying primarily under the
17 Hunter against Erickson situation, I think is readily
18 distinguishable because there was clearly there, just as
19 we go back in the older case of Yik Wo or in Gomillion

20 against Lightfoot — it was too clear that there, when
21 you were interfering and putting a special premium on
22 the getting a charter amendment in Akron that required
23 to go out and get a majority vote, when up to that time
24 the minorities involved were only obliged to get what
25 any other ordinance would be, the councilmanic reading,

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

instead of going to the electorate -- that you’ve got a

2 clear case for violating a race and making a racial
3 classification.
4

But you cannot take that and lift it, and it

5 seems to me this Court in almost a comparable problem in
6 James against Valtierra later declined, where the
7 obvious impact or character was lessened by the fact
8 that you only had low cost housing involved in that
9 case, and you refused then to follow and extend the
10 Hunter doctrine.
11

I would like to conclude by discussing what I

12 interpreted was their second effort to persuade you to
13 reverse the court below, and that is that this
14 proposition had a discriminatory purpose.

Now, in

15 support of that argument — they even seem to concede
16 that it doesn’t say so on its face.

And they can’t

17 point to — they point to no evidence below of that
18 purpose to establish that.
19

What they really point to is a collection, a

20 miscellaneous collection of newspapers, campaign
21 literature, and historical treatises.

I have made the

22 point in our brief that none of that was admitted
23 below.

24

It wasn’t considered.
Now, there is a suggestion in this latest

1 you should do with this case, the very least, is send it

3 discriminatory purpose.

And they say there was no

4 remand, therefore you should remand.

I submit if you look at the very last words of

6 the opinion below, as it appears at the end on page 70A
7 of the same appendix, and I quotes

"The orders of May

9 One — "and July 7,

1980" — and that is the one that

10 was made moot by the ruling on the Proposition One — is
11 "remanded to the trial court for further proceedings
12 consistent with this opinion."
13

But not only was the court below remanding,

14 but a remand was held and there was another trial.
15 There was a trial in the summer of 1981, where the
16 Petitioners in face of that remand with notice had every
17 opportunity to offer evidence of this discriminatory
18 purpose.

And they offered none, no evidence.

And I call to the Court's attention that this

First, this is not a Hunter v. Erickson case,

the same reason that James v. Valtierra was not a

18 that no federally funded low rent housing project could
19 be developed by a state body without approval by a
20 majority of
21

22

characterization ?
MR. LEE:

If counsel's characterization of

23

what the Court of Appeals said in its opinion below were

24

correct, then you would have the difficult problem of

25

the language saying A and the Court of Appeals saying

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

not A, and I've always wondered what this Court would do

2 under those circumstances.
3

In fact, you don’t have that case.

I’m sure

4 that this was just a slip in the exuberance of the
5 moment.

But there is nowhere, absolutely nowhere in

6 that Court of Appeals opinion, that says that the only
7 purpose for which court-ordered busing is prohibited is
8 for racial balance purposes.
9

How, it is true that on five or six different

10 occasions the Court of Appeals does refer to the fact
11 that this prohibits the use of court-ordered busing for
12 desegregation purposes.

But nowhere does that court

13 opinion say or does any other authoritative
14 interpretation by the California authorities say that
15 it’s only for those purposes.

The only authoritative

16 ruling that you have on that subject comes from the
17 California Attorney General, and his view is, as it must
18 be, that the amendment means what it says.

QUESTION:

But this refers only to

12 constitutional obligations.

The Proposition One relates

13 only to the California constitution as I understand it.

MR. LEE:

All right, all right.

But assume

15 that there were — that someone came into -- assume that
16 someone came into court and asserted that there were a
17 constitutional obligation, for example, say they had a
18 budget-balancing amendment or whatever.

This would

19 prevent the courts from ever enforcing any court-ordered
20 busing remedy for the purpose of achieving any
21 constitutional amendment in the State of California.
22

QUESTION:

Well, perhaps one can think of

23 hypothetical, and I'm not sure yours really fits.

But

24 is it not true that the only real life problems that the

5

MR. LEE:

There is no disadvantage to anyone

6 from permitting states to try something beyond the
7 bounds of the Fourteenth Amendment demands and then back
8 off if it doesn't work.

The successes from that kind of

9 experimentation redound to everyone's benefit.

The

10 failures harm only the particular state that undertook
11 the experiment.
12

It would be a great disservice not only to

13 federalism generally but specifically to the cause of
14 relieving racial segregation if states such as
15 California were not permitted to try the waters beyond
16 the Fourteenth Amendment barrier reef, with the
17 assurance that the Fourteenth Amendment will permit them
18 to come back to a safer harbor if the experiment does
19 not work.
20

Now, my opponent says that that's true, but

21 you can't do it where it's race specific.

That is only

22 saying that you can't ever back off from efforts at
23 racial imbalance, because by definition you have to use
24 racial imbalance efforts; they have to be saying that
25 racial balance efforts are race specific.

And as a

consequence the interests of school desegregation,

whether de jure or defacto, would scarcely be served if

3

the one state, the one state whose legal requirements go

4 the farthest in dealing with segregation and clearly go
5 beyond the demands of the Fourteenth Amendment, were to
6 be

the only state whose efforts to deal with de facto

7 segregation were held to violate the Fourteenth
8

Amendment.
Justice Brandeis in his classic statement on

9

10 the values of experimentation pointed out that this
11

Court has the power to prevent an experiment, and that

12 it is one of the happy incidents of the federal system
13 that a single courageous state may, if its citizens
14 choose, serve as a laboratory.

If it does,

will know that its reward for experimenting

17 beyond the bounds of the federal Constitution will be a
18 Hunter v.

Erickson requirement that experiments which

19 fail must nevertheless be continued.
20

21

It is not a sufficient answer to that argument
to say that it is race specific in that instance,

22 because all that that is really saying is once again
23 that it really is a ratchet wrench,

that you can't

24 really back off once you’ve tried something and it

You have five minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE H. TRIBE, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

11
12

MR. TRIBE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

13

To begin with, I suppose I should note that no

14 argument is any longer being made by the board in this
15 case that there is some compelling justification for
16 this measure.

Unlike the Seattle law, for example,

17 there's no suggestion that this is genuinely a
18 neighborhood policy.

Students can be forcibly bused out

19 of their neighborhoods if the school board

realizes or

20 agrees that that's what it ought to do.
21

So what we're left with is the question of

22 whether either on its face or under Arlington Heights it
23 is a racial classification.
24

QUESTION:

25 not that Valtierra

Mr. Tribe, do you agree or do you

MR. TRIBE*

2

No, I certainly don't. Justice

3 White.
4

QUESTION*

It just said it might have some

5 impact oh -6

MR. TRIBE*

It says if it's a statistical

7 coincidence that that’s not race specific.

Indeed, in

8 Hunter what Section 137 added was race and religion to

9 list that already included taxation.

It can't make a

10 difference whether it’s in one law or two.
11

It seems to

me very clear that if an obstacle is put in the way of

12 racial minorities as such,

even if a couple of other

13 obstacles are thrown in for good measure, that does not
14 invoke James v. Valtierra by any stretch of the
15 imagination.
16

A word about Arlington Heights.

It's simply

17 not the case that opportunities have been bypassed to
18 try to show racially discriminatory purpose.

Proof was

19 introduced, but its admissibility was never ruled on
20 because the trial court thought
21 Proposition

One was immaterial.

that the validity of
And there was a remand

22 from the Court of Appeal, but expressly limited to the

23 question of what to do now that the Court of Appeal had
24 decided Proposition One was constitutional.
25

No evidence was allowed on remand on the very

53
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

question on which no evidence has yet been heard in this

2 case, namely whether Proposition One was motivated by

3 desire to impose greater obstacles to racial
4 minorities.
5

So I do think that at a very minimum the

6 failure to apply Arlington Heights was fatal below.

7

QUESTION:

But surely the Court of Appeals

8 disaffirmed the trial court's previous findings of

9 purposeful racial discrimination.

-- are you suggesting nevertheless

14 it turned right around and said Proposition One
15 nevertheless indicates a racial purpose?

18

19 asking what you're submitting.

22 purposeful discrimination by the board.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. TRIBE:

By the board, exactly.
And then as to Proposition One it

25 said that, because it has a disclaimer on its face and

54
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

because it couli have been properly motivated, it

2 follows that there need be no inquiry under Arlington

3 Heights.

That is surely a misstatement of the law.

4

But we don't even need to reach Arlington

5 Heights, because I think it is very clear, as Justice
6 White has pointed out,

that even if something hits

7 explicitly race plus something else the explicit
8 attention to race imposing an obstacle to racial
9 minorities independently triggers the strictest
10 scrutiny, which can’t be satisfied here because there's
11

no compelling justification.
More than that, the suggestion of the

12

13 Solicitor General that we have here one of these very
14 difficult rases where the law on its face is simply
15 incompatible perhaps with what the Court of Appeals
16 said, and then you try to figure out what to do, is
17 untenable.

The law on its face, as Justice Stevens

18 points out, clearly suggests in light of the fact that
19 the California constitution when it comes to pupil
20

assignment had added nothing outside the area of race,

21 clearly suggests that it’s only race that's being spoken

22 of.

23

But if there were ambiguity the Court of

24 Appeals would have settled it.

4 state-prescribed racial imbalance.
5

The court says on page S7A, all the amendment

6 does — despite the Solicitor General's suggestion that

7 they never said "all”, they never said "only" — all the
8 amendment does is remove from courts this remedy to end

9 racial isolation.

Nothing could be clearer than that

10 this Court is bound
11

by the authoritative interpretation

of the state courts on this.
QUESTION;

12

That isn't really an authoritative

13 interpretation on the point you're making, though, is
14 it?

It wasn't put to them then that this applies to

15 handicapped, pupil assignment for handicap purposes, and
16 they say, no, it doesn't apply for handicaps, it's just
17 for racial imbalance.
18

MR. TRIBE;

Well, it was -- Justice Rehnquist,

19 it was suggested by counsel for the board that it wasn't
20 put to them

21 it was.

that it was race specific.

On the contrary,

That was half the argument in the Court of

22 Appeals.

23

QUESTION;

Well, was this — was the

24 proposition that Proposition One had an effect on
25 assignment for handicap purposes put to them in oral

1 argument?
2

ME. TRIBE;

No, of course not, because no one

3 would have imagined that it did.
4

QUESTION;

5

MR. TRIBE;

Did you argue orally?
No.

But what we argged in the

6 case below, what was argued in the case below, was that
7 the only thing it covers is race.
8 addresses that issue.

And the court

It's not a new argument.

It

9 addresses it and, instead of denying it, it says, no, it
10 embraces the Fourteenth Amendment.
11

That is not enough under the Constitution when

12 it puts an obstacle specifically in the way of
13 vindicating racial rights, it creates a forbidden system
14 of courts that inadequately protect minorities.
15

Thank you.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Thank you, gentlemen.

17 The case is submitted.

19 matter was submitted.)
