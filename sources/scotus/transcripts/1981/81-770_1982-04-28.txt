denials of equal protection of the law.
The known facts of this case are simple and

3

essentially not in dispute.

amendments took effect, the plaintiffs, who are all AFDC

recipients, rac ived their regular welfare checks.

1

case as prepared by the plaintiffs do not indicate one

2

way or another whether resort was made to voluntary

3

assistance.
It's also apparent from a close reading of the

4
5

plaintiffs* papers that although there is in each case

6

an allegation of utter destitution and inability to get

7

along without any cash assistance, the fact remains that

8

from the time of the incident as reported to the police

9

and then as reported to welfare officials and, in one

10

case, reported to counsel even before the individual

11

went to the welfare officials, there elapsed a period of

12

an average of a week or so, in one case a little less, a

13

couple of cases a little more, from the time of the

14

incident until a temporary restraining order was

15

obtained in court.
I mention it because although there is the

16
17

allegation in the complaint and in the supporting

18

affidavits that these people were utterly destitute and

19

unable to get along without cash emergency assistance,

20

there is no allegation that somehow they couldn't

21

manage.

22

from the silence in the plaintiffs* papers, that somehow

23

they did manage.

24

missed a mean.

25

Somehow, it would appear, at least, I submit,

There is no allegation that anyone

Nr. Hammer, may I just understand

the thrust here?

Are you challenging their standing?

2

MR. HAMMER*

3

QUESTION;

4
5

No, sir, I am not.
Then what is the legal point you're

making?
MR. HAMMER;

The point that I'm trying to

6

make, Mr. Justice Stevens, is that the claim of

7

necessity for public cash emergency assistance which is

8

being advanced by the papers is one which is certainly

9

not totally established by the record, to say the least.

10

QUESTION;

Well, will that prevent us from —

11

MR. HAMMER;

It is important because ever

12

since Dandridge v. Williams, this Court has held that a

13

state or, indeed. Congress, when it appropriates its

14

portion, need not take care of each and every possible

15

need that a welfare recipient conceivably may have.

16

The thrust of these decisions —

17

QUESTION;

But still what you are saying,

18

then, is these people are not being denied what they

19

seek because of their membership in the class of AFDC

20

recipients but rather for some other reason?

21

MR. HAMMER;

No, sir.

My point is that the

22

decisions of this Court which permit the granting of

23

less than the established needs of a welfare recipient,

24

I submit, not only demonstrates as a matter of law but

25

demonstrates as a matter of fact that it is possible in

13

QUESTION*

Did you just think of it?

14

MR. HAMHERs

No, sir, I didn't.

The action as

15

brought in the district court sought to declare this

16

statute unconstitutional as a denial of the equal

17

protection of the laws.

18

violated the Supremacy Clause of Article VI of the

19

Federal Constitution.

20

was sought.

21

There was also a claim that it

An injunction against enforcement

In addition, there was a claim of bad faith

22

enforcement so that damages was also claimed.

The basis

23

of this was the Second Circuit's decision in Lynch

24

against Philbrook, the Seventh Circuit's decision in

25

Handley against Trainer, which was reversed sub non,
7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

Quern against Handley, and Williams against Wobemuth, a

2

similar Third Circuit case.

This latter claim for

3 damages was ultimately dropped.
4

Initially, since this Court had not yet

5

decided Quern and there was room, certainly, for

6

argument at the circuit level, the District Court,

7

relying on the Second Circuit’s Lynch case, held that

8

the statutes violated the Supremacy Clause.

9

affirmed upon the decision of the District Court.

The Circuit
At

10

this point this Court had heard argument in Quern and we

11

petitioned the Circuit for rehearing.

12

The Circuit held the petition until the

13 decision in Quern came down and they sent the case back
14

to the District Court for reconsideration in light of

15 this Court*s-ruling.

Upon remand, the District Conrt

16 held, first, that the Supremacy Clause was not violated,
17

citing Quern, and that of the three subdivisions, that

18

the no cash provision violated equal protection.

19

However, the denial of replacement for lost or stolen

20 case was upheld as a reasonable means of avoiding
21

fraudulent claims and, likewise, the prohibition against

22 duplication was upheld as a reasonable means of
23
24
25

determining what emergencies were to be handled.
The Circuit heard the case again, this time
upon the appeal of plaintiffs.

The Circuit upheld us on

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Supremacy Clause grounds, but reversed the District

2

Court on the issue of lost or stolen cash, claiming that

3

there was no reasonable basis shown to treat AFDC people

4

differently from others.
The Circuit affirmed on the issue of the no

5

6

cash.

This time, however, with respect to the

7

replacement provision the District Court's decision was

8

not appealed, so that the District Court decision on

9

replacement of a grant stands as the law in the case.
What I should like to discuss during the time

10

11

allotted to me is basically three points — that under

12

the authority of decisions such as Dandridge the

13

non-duplication provisions being as they are a

14

reasonable exercise of the state's discretion as to how

15

its money should be allotted covers essentially the

16

entire issue raised by the plaintiffs.
To a certain extent, the statute is redundant

17
18

because if you say in our submission that you need not

19

duplicate a regular grant, by the same token, you need

20

not duplicate the grant because part of it was lost or

21

stolen.

22

grant which was given to AFDC people.

23

Likewise, you need not duplicate part of a cash

Additionally, we view that the loss or theft

24

provisions is an appropriate prophylactic measure to

25

assure that fraudulent claims are not received or paid.

S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

And, finally, we would submit from the record

2

that the lower courts simply missed the point and erred

3

in holding the AFDC people were treated substantively in

4

any different way than non-AFDC people.

5

evidence in the record was an affidavit submitted by the

6

state and it was never controvered by the plaintiffs in

7

any respect.

They disagreed, Your Honor, but —

state law, isn't it a matter — it's a construction of

there's no real accurate construction on what state —
QUESTION;

16

Well, you might say they made a

17

mistake, but don't we usually take the Court of Appeals'

18

word on the construction of state law?
MR. HAMMER:

19

That may be true. Your Honor, but

20

the problem here is that on the face of the cases relied

21

upon both by the plaintiffs and by the Court of Appeals,

22

it is far from clear that state law is what they say it

23

is.

24
25

QUESTION;

Hell, they thought it was plain on

the face of the statute.

MR. HAMMER;

the Court please, I should like to follow up on the

7

question that Mr. Justice White posed just before we

attention to pages 16-A and 17-A of the jurisdictional

If I may, I would like to invite the Court's

statement, which contains the opinion of the Court of

11

Appeals.

error of misinterpretation of state law and an error of

misapplication of Rule 56(e).

13

You're speaking of the Circuit

Yes, sir — all three of them.

All

three of them practice right in New York City.
HR. HAHHER*

That may be so, Your Honor, but

even so they are not infallible.

14

QUESTION*

15

HR. HAHHER*

16

All three of them

It may be so.

That’s the record.

It does not mean that they are

infallible upon issues of interpretation of state law.

17

QUESTION*

They are less fallible than you.

18

QUESTI0H*

I suppose they were not specialists

19
20

in welfare law.
HR. HAHHER*

Ho, sir.

As of the members of

21

the Court, Judge Kerse practiced on Hall Street, Judge

22

Feinberg, the Chief Judge, has been on — while he's had

23

a number of welfare cases upon which he has sat, and

24

Judge Adelstein.

25

insofar as the particular point of law is concerned, I

They've all had these cases, but

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

think their decision has to be looked upon upon its own

2

merits, not because they may be —
QUESTION:

3

I don't know of — who on this

4

bench has practiced welfare law?

5

You need welfare lawyers as judges?
MR. HAMMER:

6

I don't know either.

Not necessarily, Your Honor, but

7

it is a specialty.

All I am saying is not that it's

8

necessary to have a patent lawyer to decide a patent

9

case or a securities lawyer to decide a securities

10

case.

11

experienced New York judges does not make their decision

12

sacrosanct, with all due respect to them — and I have

13

the utmost personal respect for the three individuals

14

concerned.

15

All I am saying is that simply because they are

I submit they were wrong simply because they

16

misapplied a Federal rule and they misinterpreted the

17

governing — such state decisional law as is available.

18

QUESTION:

Meaning what case, counsel?

19

MR. HAMMER:

They misinterpreted — they first

20

misrelied upon Jones against Berman because it predated

21

the statute and the cases of Nazaro, of Orr v. Shang.

22

All these indicated that in administrative practice the

23

state was interpreting the language much more generously

24

than the face of the statute might suggest.

25

Maybe the welfare officials were wrong.

Maybe

1

they were being too generous with the public purse, but

2

the fact remains that there seemed to be an indication,

3

at least in the lower courts, Justice O'Conner, that

4

these people and members of the class who are

5

represented here today under certain circumstances would

6

be getting emergency cash assistance.

And all of these plaintiffs involve

that situation, is that right?

13

MR. HAMMER*

14

QUESTION*

15
16

On that I would say there is no

That's correct.
So every one of the people in the

class before us alleged they had lost the check or cash.
MR. HAMMER*

They had lost the proceeds.

If

17

it were simply a lost check, the piece of paper would be

18

replaced without any difficulty, but we're talking now

19

about the cash.

And none of them ever got any

further than challenging that first rule about the

1

replacement of the proceeds of a check, as I understand

2

it.

3

for cash relief?

They didn’t actually get to the point of applying

4

SR. HAMMER:

Well, they did apply for cash.

5

They applied for cash and the welfare officials turned

6

them down on the ground that the new amendment said you

7

may not replace — you may not get cash because you're

8

an AFDC recipient and you may not get cash because you

9

are replacing part of your regular recurring grant.

10
11

12

QUESTION:

So they were turned down on both

grounds.
SR. HASHER:

Plus the additional ground

13

that — a somewhat redundant ground of subdivision (f)

14

that they could not replace a grant in general or

15

duplicate a grant.

16

QUESTION:

Sr. Hammer, let me see if I

17

understand your argument.

As I read the Court of

18

Appeals opinion, they said that you didn’t content there

19

was a rational basis for the discrimination but, rather,

20 you said there was no discrimination.
21

HR. HAHHER:

22

QUESTION:

23

That’s correct.
And you do now agree that because

they are AFDC beneficiaries they can’t get cash.

24

MR. HASHER:

25

QUESTION:

That’s right.
Are you arguing that no other

1

citizen of New York gets cash?
HR. HAMMER;

2

Our contention is — and this is

3

the Hickey affidavit — someone, because the cash that

4

is sought to be replaced is part of the regular

5

recurring grant they are treated no differently than

6

other categorical recipients or non-recipients of public

7

assistance who get — who get cash because whatever

8

class you fall into you get it only once.

9

get it twice.

This is the whole point.

QUESTION;

10

You cannot

But am I correct in believing that

11

some non-AFDC recipients can get cash pursuant to this

12

statute?

13

MR. HAMMER*

They get cash pursuant to the

14

statute as emergency assistance because it is for an

15

emergency rather than for the replacement of the regular

16

recurring grant.

17

against allowing AFDC recipients to get cash.

18

This is the nub of the argument

The AFDC recipient gets cash as part of the

19

regular grant.

If the AFDC recipient were to get the

20

cash as emergency assistance on top of it, the emergency

21

assistance program would then, contrary to the intent of

22

the legislature, become a supplement to AFDC rather than

23

emergencies and this is what, as I understand the Court

24

recognize in the Quern case, that the states were free

25

to tailor the emergency assistance programs to their own

for my disagreement is this*

opinion which is annexed to the juridictional statement,

21

and the relevant page of the opinion that I’m concerned

22

with is 44-A of the appendix of the jurisdictional

24

as having as its purpose preventing recipients of public

assistance from simply claiming that we have used up our

2

augment the ongoing assistance grant.
The District Court said this was the purpose

of the duplication provision.

5

Court went further and said but it's c'ear that the

6

duplication provision should not be read as precluding

7

emergency assistance to public assistance families who

8

are indeed faced with a crisis event or emergency

9

situation.

10

However, the District

I submit that that analysis by the District

11

Court is correct.

state has been making between the supplementation of a

grant, which the state says it's its interest in not

making under the emergency assistance program.

It reflects the argument that the

MR. SCHWARTZ*

The state has not challenged

that interpretation and not only have they not

19

challenged it, but indeed they acknowledged that the

20

purpose of the restrictions is to limit emergency

21

assistance to crisis situations.

in this analysis.

And that’s reflected

As a matter of collateral interest,

how does the state go about determining whether the

alleged lost or stolen cash was used to buy lottery

tickets or to bet on the horses or to use in the local

MR. SCHWARTZ*

7

If the question is how do they

determine a loss or theft, whether the loss or theft

occurred, the state, of course, has the power to

QUESTION*

Realistically is there any way the

state can check on it?
MR. SCHWARTZ*

Yes, Your Honor.

The state,

23

for example, could insist that the recipient report a

24

claim theft to the police department as a prerequisite

25

for getting emergency assistance.

The state

commissioner can check

QUESTION*

How much of a check is that?

3

NR. SCHWARTZ:

The state can check the police

4

report, can interview the recipient, can make a home

5

visit, for that matter.

6

misses the essential argument that we make with respect

7

to the loss-theft provision, because the State of New

8

York does provide emergency assistance in cases of loss

9

or theft of every other type of income other than public

But, Your Honor, that really

10

assistance, and that includes a wide array of public

11

benefits, including Social Security, unemployment

12

compensation, workers’ compensation, public retirement

13

benefits, as well as the loss or theft of private

14

income, such as wages and support payments.

15

Now I submit to this court that the state —

16

QUESTION:

17

Does that include the loss of a

private pension?
HR. SCHWARTZ:

18

Yes, it does. Your Honor.

Now

19

I submit, and I think it’s significant, that the state's

20

ability to detect a fraudulent claim is in fact greater

21

in the casa of tha non-recipient who claims that a loss

22

or theft has created destitution than in the case of the

23

recipient.

24
25

And it’s for this reason.

In the case of the

recipient of public assistance, the Department of Social

1

Services in the ordinary process of determining ongoing

2

eligibility for public assistance and free of the crisis

3

pressure that surrounds an application for emergency

4

assistance, has already determined a large number of the

5

indicia of eligibility for public assistance, including

6

the applicant's identity, the applicant's residence,

7

available income and resources, shelter needs,

8

alternative sources of support.

9

In the case of the non-recipient that claims a

10

loss or theft has rendered me destitute, the Department

11

of Social Services must first make all these

12

determinations in the first instance.

13

that the state does indeed have a legitimate interest in

14

prventing fraudulent claims.

15

other position.

16

So we recognize

We could not take any

But our claim is that this disparity in

17

treatment between public assistance recipients who claim

18

a loss or theft on the one hand and non-recipients who

19

are a group of families who claim destitution and who

20

are given different treatment in that their applications

21

for emergency assistance are given individual treatment

22

is not supported by any difference in detecting fraud.

MR. SCHWARTZ*

11

That — I agree with Your

13 Court of Appeals decision, that the basis of the Court
14

of Appeals decision is found on page 18-A of the

Well, what was the Court of Appeals

MR. SCHWARTZ*

The problem with the District

12

Court's decision is that it, in my opinion, is that it

13

did not focus on the two classes.

14

opinion simply said that the — it is a legitimate state

15

interest to seek to prevent fraudulent claims of loss or

16

theft, and we find that this is sufficient to justify

17

the automatic denial.

The District Court's

The Court of Appeals said, well, we agree..

19

The state does have a legitimate interest in seeking to

20

prevent fraudulent claims of loss or theft.

22

claims, but the same administrative burden and expense

23

lies with respect to the favored class.

HR. SCHWARTZ;

There aren't any.

That's not how I read it. Your

Honor.

that there are problems with respect to —

That's my point.

That's what the Court of Appeals

held.
MB. SCHWARTZ:

12

Yes.

That's my point.

And the

13

District Court did not say anything to the contrary.

14

The District Court simply made a general statement that

15

the state does have an interest in avoiding

16

administrative burdens and expenses in situations like

17

this.

18

He don't quarrel with that.
If I might just take the very few minutes I

19

have remaining, we have raised, in addition to the

20

constitutional claim, a federal statutory claim, and we

21

have raised it throughout this litigation.

My adversary

22 has chosen not to address it, but I submit that it's a

significant claim and it provides a basis upon which

this Court can affirm the judgment of the Court of

MR. SCHWARTZ;

11

Well, the only point I'd like

12

to stress is that six months after this Court's decision

13

in Quern the Secretary did indeed issue an action

14

transmittal and in that action transmittal acknowledged

15

the holding in Quern, said that the states do have broad

16

discretion in shaping their emergency assistance

programs, but that the states must include AFDC families

18

in their emergency assistance program.

HR. SCHWARTZ:

Yes.

The Court of Appeals did

3

come to that conclusion.

5

He disagree with that.

We’ve

In addition to the action transmittal, the

6

Secretary did submit a full amicus curiae brief to the

7

Court of Appeals in which the Secretary came to the

8

conclusion that under his equitable treatment regulation

9

state discrimination in the EAF program against the

10

neediest families, AFDC families, is inconsistent with

11

Federal policy and, therefore, is unlawful.

12

And it’s our position that this is a

13

legitimate exercise of rulemaking by the Secretary and

14

that the judgment should be affirmed on that basis.

15

QUESTION*

Mr. Schwartz, isn’t it true that

16

the analysis of that issue is really pretty much the

17

same as the analysis of the constitutional issue,

18

because the bottom line is whether it’s arbitrary or not?

19

MR. SCHWARTZ*

That — I disagree, with all

20

due respect. Hr. Justice Stevens, because there is no

21

reason why the equitable treatment regulation has got to

22

be interpreted in the same manner as the rational basis

23

standard under the equal protection clause.

24
25

QUESTION*

In other words, the content of

arbitrariness could be somewhat broader as construed by

2

Constitution•

3

MR. SCHWARTZs

It can be, and we have lodged

4

documents with the Clerk of the Court which we also

5

submitted to the Court of Appeals, in which the

6

Commissioner of Social Security of HHS has taken the

7

position that classifications in the emergency

8

assistance program must be tailored to the purpose of

9

the particular program and specifically rejected

10
11

rational basis review.
Our position, very briefly, is that while

12

states do indeed have broad discretion in shaping their

13

emergency assistance programs, that discretion is not

14

unlimited discretion and in many categorical programs

15

where states do have broad discretion there is still

16

room for reasonable rulemaking by the Secretary to

17

ensure that state plans do not conflict with the

18

purposes of the Federal Act.
