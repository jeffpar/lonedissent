ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERNEST LEFF, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

7
8

MR. LEFF:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice and

may it please the Court:

9

With all due respect, we submit that the

10

principle issue in this case is whether federal savings

11

and loans associations will be able to enforce the due

12

on sale clauses in their mortgage contracts pursuant to

13

federal regulation or whether the enforcement of those

14

clauses will be subjected to state law.

15

The due on sale clause in most federal savings

16

and loan association mortgage contracts permits the

17

association to call the loan whenever there is a

18

transfer of the real property security underlying the

19

loan.

20

federal savings and loan associations.

21

It is a practice that has been long used by

There has been no federal regulation expressly

22

mentioning due on sale clauses with respect to federal

23

associations until 1976, when the Federal Home Loan Bank

24

Board, acting pursuant to the authority vested in it by

25

Section 5(a) of the Homeowners Loan Act, adopted a

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

regulation authorizing federal savings and loan

2

associations across the country to enforce due on sale

3

clauses in mortgage contracts.

4

QUESTION*

Well, isn’t that one of the

5

questions, whether it did act pursuant to the statutory

6

authority?

7

MR. LEFF:

Yes.

I think that is one of the

8

questions, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.

9

Homeowners Loan Act, especially Section 5(a),

And we think that the

10

specifically vests authority of the Federal Home Loan

11

Bank Board in the mortgage loan contract in its terms

12

and its structures.

13

QUESTION*

Well, how deeply do you think that

14

the statute authorizes the Home Loan Board to intrude

15

into state contract law generally?

16

MR. LEFFs

The Section 5(a) of the Homeowners

17

Loan Act permits the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to

18

inject itself into the operations of federal savings and

19

loan associations.

20

federal savings and loan association is the mortgage

21

loan contract.

22

the assets of savings and loan associations are in

23

mortgage loan contracts.

24
25

One of the principal operations of a

In fact, approximately 78 percent of all

So the Federal Horae Loan Bank Board has a very
severe and deep interest in the terms and structures of

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

mortgage loan contracts, and since at least 1936 has

2

denominated the kind of mortgage loan contracts that a

3

federal association can enter into as well as the terms

4

of that mortgage loan contract.

5

QUESTIONS

Well, it's one thing to denominate

6

the kinds of contracts that a federal savings and loan

7

can enter into.

8

state law which is generally applicable to debtors and

9

creditors.

10

It's another thing to try to control

NR. LEFFs

Federal associations, Mr. Justice

11

Rehnquist, are established under federal law, and

12

therefore what they do is a matter of federal law.

13

QUESTION*

Well, I don't happen to agree with

14

you in the full sweep of your statement.

15

the law as it existed in 1969 when I left private

16

practice in my home state of Arizona was that, whatever

17

the form of a security of real property took, it could

18

only be foreclosed by a proceeding in court the way you

19

do with a mortgage, where as I understood the law in

20

California you could foreclose a truste deed by simply

21

notice of sale without a judicial proceeding.

22

Supposing —

Now, what if the Home Loan Board back here in

23

Washington decided that, with all the secondary market

24

and so on, it was just too confusing to have two

25

different rules in two sets of states about how you

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
-ton VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

foreclosed a mortgage» and so they said that any

2

mortgage entered into by a federal savings and loan

3

shall be foreclosable as a deed of trust without a court

4

proceeding.

5

Arizona rule or the rule of some other states that said

6

any security of real property has to be foreclosed by a

7

judicial proceeding?

8

9

Do you think that could supersede the

MR. LEFFj

I think the direct answer to your

question, Mr. Justice Rehnguist, is that the Federal

10

Home Loan Bank Board, if the foreclosure procedures of

11

any state impinge directly on the operations of a

12

federal savings and loan association, could adopt a

13

regulation that preempts state law in that respect.

14

QUESTI0H:

Hell, you really read a great deal

15

more into the authorization from Congress than I daresay

16

Congress thought it was doing in 1933 when it passed

17

this statute.

18

MR. LEFF:

Well, Congress specifically

19

authorized the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in Section

20

5(a) to select the best practices of state savings and

21

loan institutions to adopt in respect to federal

22

association operations.

23

Loan Bank Board the right to select and reject among

24

practices of state associations we believe gave it

25

sufficient authority to preempt anything that impinged

And giving the Federal Home

1

directly on the operation of a federal savings and loan

2

association, which by law is regulated by the Federal

3

Home Loan Bank Board.

4

QUESTION*

Would that include state taxes?

5

Could the Federal Board determine that a particular

6

state tax law couldn’t be enforced because it somehow

7

impinged upon the operation?

8

9
10

HR. LEFF*

In my view — and this would be

speculative and hypothetical — if a particular tax was

14

Well, my assumption is a state

tax law that takes in all businesses in some fashion,

18

including savings and loans.

20

21

won’t —

MR. LEFF*

The savings and loans are

Under your theory could the

Under my theory the Federal Home

23

Loan Bank Board has been given authority to attack any

24

infringement on the operations of the federal

25

associations, including those under tax law.

As a

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

matter of practice, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has

2

left a number of practices, including the recording

3

practices, zoning practices, taxing practices, to the

4

states because the states are more efficient at these

5

than the Federal Home Loan Bank Board could be in

6

respect to those operations.

7

But if we're talking about the scope of the

8

authority of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, their

9

authority reaches any contrary state law, in my

10

judgment, which impinges directly on the operation,

11

examination, organization, incorporation, or regulation

12

of federal savings and loan associations, which are the

13

words of Section 5(a) of the Homeowners Loan Act.

14

QUESTIONi

What is the interest of the Federal

15

Government to justify this intrusion, if we were to call

16

it an intrusion, into state law?

17

HR. LEFFs

Hell, the Federal Horae Loan Bank

18

Board has conducts! a study in respect to the due on

19

sale operations.
QUESTION:

22

with it at all?

23

collectability of these loans?

25

Why is the Federal Home Loan Bank Board concerned
What's its interest in the

MR. LEFF:

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board is

the Government agency that supervises all federal

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

savings and loan associations and charters them

3

financial stability of these organizations and their

4

continued viability.

5
6

They have an obligation with respect to the

QUESTION:

In respect to the regulation -Is this connected with the

guarantee of deposits in some way?

7

MR. LEFF:

The guarantee of deposits involves

8

a different statute, Your Honor, the National Housing

9

Act, and it has nothing —

10
11

QUESTION:

It's the same Government that's

guaranteeing the deposits.

12

MR. LEFFs

It's the same Government, but a

13

different, related agency, but not the same agency as

14

the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.

15

Act of 1933 does not insure deposits of any

16

institution.

17

The Homeowners Loan

So the Bank Board has, to answer your

18

question, a very direct interest in the financial

19

stability of these institutions because they are the

20

sole regulators of these institutions.
QUESTION:

21

And if they collapse fiscally,

22

another part of the Government has got to pick up the

23

tab .

24

MR. LEFF:

That's right. Your Honor.

25

QUESTION:

Is that the basis for justifying

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

4

some regulatory control?
MR. LEFFi

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, it

certainly is in my judgment.
In 1978, two years after the federal

5

regulation was promulgated and enrolled under the

6

Administrative Procedures Act, the Supreme Court of

7

California, reversing its previous position which had

8

been in force up until September 1978, stated that a due

9

on sale clause could not be enforced as a result of a

10

simple transfer and could only be enforced where there

11

was an impairment of the underlying security or a risk,

12

of default.

13

use of a due on sale clause constituted an illegal

14

restraint on alienation.

15

And having said that, they said that the

My client, Appellant, Fidelity Federal Savings

16

& Loan Association, made three loans.

17

in 1971, a loan in

18

Those loans are before this honorable Court.

19

They made a loan

1972, and another loan in 1973.

Fidelity Federal, in relying upon the federal

20

regulation and the longstanding practice of use of due

21

on sale clause for federal associations, when it learned

22

that these loans had been transferred to third parties

23

in connection with the sale of the underlying security,

24

called the loans, sought to foreclose, and we found

25

ourselves in state court.

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

In the state court, the trial court held that

2

Section 5(a) and the regulations adopted thereunder

3

preempted the jurisdiction of the state courts and

4

granted summary judgment in favor of Fidelity Federal.

5

The Court of Appeals, relying on the Supreme Court

6

opinion, which is called Wellerikamp versus Bank, of

7

America, issued in September 1978, held that that

8

opinion was applicable to federal savings and loan

9

associations and held that Fidelity Federal could not

10

foreclose on these loans, even though they had made the

11

call and the loan balances were due, because these loans

12

were subject to the restraint on alienation decision of

13

the Supreme Court of California.

14

We say that the decision of the Supreme

15

Committee of California and the court below, the Court

16

of Appeals below in this matter, presents a clear,

17

direct and inescapable conflict between federal

18

regulation and state regulation such as to call the

19

attention of this Court to the issue of the supremacy

20

clause of the Constitution.

21

The conflict takes two spheres.

The first is,

22

there's a conflict between federal and state standards.

23

The federal standard is broad; it says you can enforce a

24

due on sale clause whenever there's a transfer of the

25

real property security underlying it, with limited

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

exceptions such as in case of death or if you put a

2

second trust deed or a limited term lease.

3

standard is very much narrower# more narrow, more

4

restrictive, and says essentially that you can only

5

enforce a due on sale clause if you can demonstrate an

6

impairment of the security or a risk of default.

7

The state

So these two standards cannot be reconciled,

8

despite the fact that the Court of Appeals and the

9

Appellees in this matter suggest to us that they are not

10

in conflict and can be harmonized.

11

only way these two conflicting standards can be

12

harmonized is by having the federal associations comply

13

with the state standards, because they cannot comply

14

with the federal standards and escape from state control

15

if state control applies.

I suggest that the

16

The Court of Appeals has also suggested --

17

QUESTIONS

Well, the regulation just says to

18

an association that it may, it may use these clauses.

19

It doesn't require them to.

20

MR. LEFFs

That is correct.

21

QUESTIONS

And if they use the clause they

22

could put in it, if they wanted to, precisely what the

23

state law says.

24
25

MR. LEFFs

They can adopt the clause in any

fashion that they want to, but they cannot utilize the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

right given to them in the federal statute, in the

2

federal regulation.

3

Br. Justice White, to the fact that the —

4

QUESTION;

And I would call your attention,

Well, they can use the clause.

5

question is whether the clause is subject to the

6

stricter state requirement.

7

HR. LEFFi

It is a much more narrow —

8

QUESTION!

What evidence do you have that

9
10
11

12

The

Congress intended to prevent the state from imposing a
higher standard on the use of these clauses?
HR. LEFFi

We refer again to Section 5(a) of

the Homeowners Loan Act, which directed the Federal Home

3

Loan Bank Board in adopting rules and regulations,

4

including regulations, I submit, on due on sale clauses,

5

to give respect to the best practices of the savings and

6

loan business in the United States other than the

7

federal savings and loan business, which —

8
9
20
21

22

QUESTION:

Does the statute refer to due on

sale clauses in so many words?
BR. LEFFi

The statute does not refer to due

on sale clauses.
QUESTION:

And certainly it didn't adopt a

23 uniform standard at all.

It just said, all these

24 associations could use them if they wanted to; didn't
25 have to if they didn't want to.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. LEFFs

It may be use of it is optional.

2

But in practical terms it wasn’t optional, because most

3

savings and loan associations have long used the due on

4

sale language in their mortgage contracts,

5

in this case they were used as long ago as 1971 and

6

1972, when these loans were made.

7

find we find

But the optional provision is simply to allow

8

the federal savings and loan associations to deal with

9

the unusual cases, which is traditional in the savings

10

and loan business, because in many instances you will

11

find forebearance being issued by the Federal Home Loan

12

Bank Board and the institutions they govern when there’s

13

floods and fire, and if you make it mandatory to use due

14

on sale in every case then you’re going to do some

15

injustice to some consumers.

16

So the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, while it

17

said you don’t have to use it, simply meant that in

18

certain cases the institutions may not seek to use the

19

due on sale clause because of considerations that they

20

have long used in their practices.
QUESTION t

21

May I ask you a question, Mr. Leff,

22

about your view of the scope of the power given to the

23

Board.

24

have authorized loans at interest in excess of the rate

25

permitted by the local state law?

Do you think under the statute the Board could

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. LEFF*

Well, there is a statute, the

2

Federal Home Loan Bank Board Act, that deals with usury

3

laws.

4

would be my judwgment that under the specific areas of

5

concern expressed in the Homeowners Loan Act in Section

6

5(a) the Federal Home Loan Bank Board has the authority

7

to issue regulations which could deal with the rate of

8

interest on mortgage loans.

9

But assuming there was not such a statute, it

QUESTION;

And could authorize interest rates

10

higher than those permitted by state law.

11

shortening the period of redemption in the event of a

12

foreclosure of a mortgage?

13

MR. LEFF:

How about

Could they do that?

I think it could, and I would refer

14

to the fact that in United States versus Shimer this

15

Court has held that federal law can preempt law, state

16

law —

17

QUESTION:

I don't doubt that Congress would

18

have the power to authorize such a regulation.

19

think this statute does give that broad power?

20

MR. LEFF:

But you

The statute gives the Federal Home

21

Loan Bank Board extremely broad powers to deal with the

22

areas of concern expressed in the statute, including the

23

operation of federal savings and loan associations.

24

that respect, a mortgage contract is the most important

25

function of a savings and loan association.

any provision of state law that they thought was not in

the best interests of the savings and loan?

SB. LEFF;

That's correct,

To the extent that

they exceeded what Congress thought was prudent.

Congress could cut back their authority to do so.

Yes, Your Honor.

MR. LEFF;

Yes, the first expression of it was

MR. LEFF;

Was it prior to 1976?

As a practical matter, they have

18

prior to 1976 exercised concern about the due on sale

19

clause.

20

the words "due on sale clause."

21

But they did not promulgate a regulation using

mentioned of any intent to supersede state law until

2

1976.

3

And it seems to me if Congress intended the

4

Board to have that power it's strange that it went

5

unexercised for 43 years.

MR. LEFF;

The Federal Home Loan Bank. Board

7

generally does not try to invade the field or enlarge

8

the field of its operations unless and until there is

9

some impingement upon their authority by federal — by

10

state law, and when that occurs they have the authority

11

to issue a regulation to do so.

12

Thank you.

13

QUESTION;

14

Where are there other examples,

counsel, of it superseding state law in other areas?

MR. LEFF;

Well, in terms of the contents of a

16

mortgage loan contract — I think that was the question

17

— in Section — in 12 CFR Section 545 and subdivisions

18

of that section, there are numerous regulations that

19

expressly state the nature and content of mortgage loan

20

contracts.

21
22

And a lot of them have been —
QUESTION*

But do they say, notwithstanding

contrary state law they shall prevail?

23

MR. LEFF*

No, they don't, because in our

24

judgment they don't have to.

25

this respect.

They are preeminent in

The Congress gave them the authority to

3

QUESTION*

Hell, has there ever been a

4

judicial decision, apart from this area of the law, that

5

any of those provisions supersede contrary state law?

6

MR. LEFF*

Well, there have been a number of

7

decisions of the Court of Appeals that say — the Ninth

8

Circuit and the First Circuit -- that say that

9

prepayment provisions of a mortgage loan contract is

10

preempted by federal law, that say variable interest

11

rate provisions are preempted by state law, that

12

redlining provisions relating to mortgage contracts.

13

And this Court in Conference of Federal

14

Savings and Loan Associations versus Stein very recently

15

has affirmed by summary opinion the redlining preemption

16

of federal savings and loan associations over state law

17

on the question of mortgage contracts and what areas,

18

geographic areas, they can be entered into.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE FHLBB AND FHLMC AS AMICI CURIAE
MR. SHAPIRO*

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice

and may it please the Courts
The Federal Government contends that the

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Board's due on sale regulation is a valid exercise of

2

statutory rulemaking power —

3

QUESTION:

Hr. Shapiro, how far does the

4

Government contend that the preemptive power goes?

5

you go as far as Mr. Leff in saying that the Board could

6

if it chose, to protect savings, federally insured

7

savings and loans, preempt by regulation state tax laws,

8

state zoning laws, other state regulatory laws?

9

MB. SHAPIRO:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SHAPIRO:

Do

He do go —

Or do you see a limitation?
We go, I believe, just as far,

12

although in the area of taxes there is a federal statute

13

that specifically covers the extent to which the states

14

may tax a federal instrumentality.

15

such a statute, we think that there would be regulatory

16

power.

17

In the absence of

I would point out that in the old case of

18

McCullough against Maryland this Court held that the

19

states were not empowered to tax a federal banking

20

institution at all unless the United States Government

21

gave the states permission to do that.

22

We rely in making this broad argument on

23

Section 5 of the Homeowners Loan Act, which empowers the

24

Board not only to charter and examine federal

25

associations, but also to issue rules and regulations

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

governing the operation, without any limitation on the

2

word "operation,” of such associations.

3

And in setting up these new federal

4

instrumentalities. Congress didn't simply incorporate

5

existing local practices, but instead required the Board

6

to look selectively aross the land for those practices

7

which were beneficial.

8

in adopting rules to govern financial operations the

9

Board must give "primary consideration to the best

Congress expressly provided that

10

practices of local mutual thrift institutions throughout

11

the United States."

12

And under this broad rulemaking power the

13

Board traditionally has adopted a very detailed regimen

14

of rules and regulations governing the lending practices

15

of federal associations.

16

for example, the kinds of loans that can be made, the

17

kinds of collateral that can be received, the schedule

18

for repayment, the kinds of penalty and prepayment

19

provisions that can be included in --

20

QUESTIONS

These regulations prescribe,

Isn't it true, Mr. Shapiro, that

21

most of those regulations are in the nature of

22

restrictions on the practices rather than grants of

23

authority to go beyond some other restriction?

24
25

MR. SHAPIRO;

Hell, in the prepayment area and

in the area of interest rate on mortgage escrow

1

accounts, the Board has regulations that specifically

2

say that inconsistent state law that prescribes a

3

different rule is preempted, and it*s had those

4

standards since the early seventies.

5

QUESTION*

For purposes of this case, Mr.

6

Shapiro, do you need to go so far as to say that the

7

Board could determine and fix the interest rate at a

8

rate different from that provided by state law?

9

MS. SHAPIRO*

No, Your Honor, we certainly

10

don’t.

11

dealing with prudent lending practices by federally

12

chartered associations is reasonably related to the

13

operation of these associations.

14

that, and we submit it's a very narrow contention that

15

is before the Court in this case.

16

Our position here is that this narrow regulation

We go no further than

In 1975 the Board turned its attention to the

17

issue of due on sale clauses in mortgage loan agreements

18

and issued an opinion, which is contained in the record

19

on appeal in this case, that stated that it had long

20

approved and sanctioned the use of due on sale clauses

21

and that state restrictions on due on sale clauses would

22

"endanger the financial stability of federal

23

associations and generally require them to charge higher

24

interest rates across the board."

25

these conclusions with a detailed economic analysis.

In view of certain state court litigation

2

attacking the use of due on sale clauses, the Board

3

began formal rulemaking procedures one year later.

4

published notice of its proposed rule and set forth the

5

rule in full text in the Federal Register.

received numerous comments from interested parties,

7

including the State of California, which argued at some

8

length that preemption was unnecessary in this context.

The Board

After reviewing all of these suggestions and

10

comments, the Board adopted its regulation in final

11

form, and the regulation provides that federal

12

associations may continue to include due on sale clauses

13

and may enforce them according to their literal terms.

14

The Board explained that its regulation was exclusive

15

and that federal associations are not bound by or

16

subject to any inconsistent or conflicting state law

17

requirement.

NR. SHAPIRO;

It was adopted in the early

held to supersede inconsistent state law.

that the relative importance to the state of its own law

2

is not material when there is a conflict with a valid

federal law, and the Court's reference here was to a

Finally, as this Court made quite clear in the

We do not concede that the preamble and the intent of it

in the main body of the regulation the regulation had

concluded, "and any inconsistent state law will be

you would not question the authority of the Board to

QUESTION:

That’s true, Your Honor.

Weren’t there California Supreme

Court decisions exactly the opposite way prior to

W ellenkamp?

5

MR. BOEHMER:

Originally the purpose of the

6

due on sale clause was the protection of the security

7

interest of the lender.

8

lenders — and this was really brought about by the

9

increasing inflation rate and the high interest rates —

10

the lenders attempted to use it for other purposes other

11

than its traditional purpose, the California court was

12

then presented with a series of cases involving the due

13

on sale clause and its use in various contexts.

14

When in the late sixties the

And through a series of cases beginning in the

15

early seventies, California law consistently restricted

16

the ability to use the due on sale clause solely for

17

economic purposes.

18

for a defensive purpose.

19

took, over the property, the lander could evaluate that

20

and they could file a notice of default, or call the

21

loan and file a notice of default if the money was not

22

paid.

The due on sale clause was designed
If an irresponsible grantee

Now, this was for the protection of the

23
24

security.

California law does protect the security and

25

is consistent with, for instance, the full protection

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

regulation that was promulgated by the Board in 1948,

2

because it functions as an instrument where, if a

3

situation arises because of the transfer where there is

4

an increased risk of default by the new owner or he is

5

likely to impair the security of the loan, the lender

6

may call it.

7

must show.

But that is the burden that the lender

8

Now, the reason for this rule is important.

9

The transferability of property is a key issue in the

10

survivability of any economy.

11

in times of high interest rates.

12

It is even more important

The Wellenkamp rule is designed to keep the

13

mobility of title flexible even during times of high

14

interest rates, and those are the times when flexibility

15

and transferability of property is at its worst.

16

now in California the only transactions that are

17

occurring are transactions involving the assumption of

18

existing loans, because with interest rates at 17 or 18

19

percent the average family could not buy a home, much

20

less even the more wealthier families would have

21

problems buying a home with new financing at 17-1/2

22

percent.

23

Right

That's not really a problem as far as the

24

borrowers or as far as the lenders.

The inflation and

25

the high interest rates are a problem which affects

The competition is very heavy in California

In that type of a situation we have seen in

the past federal associations not using the due on sale

clause because to do so puts them on a different scale

19

than the state institutions and a loan — if you have a

20

loan on one house and you have a loan on another house,

21

and one's with a state institution that has a due on

22

sale clause which is under California law and is

23

restricted by California law, and another one has a due

24

on sale clause which is not, the lender — the borrower

25

or the purchaser is going to buy the house that has it

the restrictions on the due on sale clause.

3

So in an area of competition with other

lenders, such as California, I don’t believe we're going

to see federal SSL's enforcing it across the board.

to do so, to accomplish the purpose of financial

13

There has been nothing of

High interest rates are what is controlling

the profitability of the savings and loans, as well as

15

the rate at which loans are being given to the public.

Mr. Boehmer, let me ask you a

question.

It's sort of collateral, but I'm curious

about it.

of the property remain liable on the mortgage?

QUESTIONS

No, they do not.

They do not.

So that what happens in effect is

3

that they’re both liable at the original interest rate,

4

both the seller and the buyer?

5

MR. BOEHMERs

In effect that's what happens.

6

There are certain other California statutes dealing with

7

anti-deficiency, which in some ways because of the

8

purchase money obligation would protect the original

9

owner.

But the true test of it is that the person that

10

takes over the property, if he doesn't make the

11

payments, if he doesn’t do everything under the trustee

12
