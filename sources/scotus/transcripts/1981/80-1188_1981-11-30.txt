ORAL ARGUMENT BY RUSSELL C. GRIMES, JR. ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

8

MR.

GRIMES:

Mr. Justice, and may it please the

9 Court, Mite Corporation initiated this action on January
1019th,

1979,

in the District Court for the Northern District

11 of Illinois, seeking a declaratory judgment that the
12 Illinois Business Takeover Act is void.

Mite alleged that

^liU»

13 the Illinois Act is pre-empted by the Williams Act, and
14 constitutes an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.
15

Mite also sought injunctive relief prohibiting the

16 Illinois Secretary of State from applying the Illinois Act
17 against Mite in connection with its takeover of Chicago
18 Rivet and Machine Company -19

QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Grimes, if it were

20pre-empted, I guess you don’t get to the commerce clause
21 issue.
22

MR. GRIMES:

23

QUESTION;

I think the -If the Williams Act pre-empted your

24 statute.
25

MR. GRIMES:

I think that would preclude getting

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to the commerce clause.
2

QUESTION:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.
Mr. Grimes, I would like to ask you a

4 question along the lines that Justice Brennan just asked.
5 There is a difference -- Do you think Judge Cudahy would
6 have written the same opinion had the Congress not passed
7 the Williams Act?
8

MR. GRIMES:

Of course, within the Seventh Circuit

9 or below, it is possible, I mean, to decide both decisions
10 -- both grounds in case one would be reversed on appeal, I
11 would imagine.

If the Williams Act were not passed, there

12 would -- you could still have, I suppose, a pre-emption
m i* '

13 ground even in the absence of Congressional action.
14

QUESTION:

What would pre-empt?

15

MR. GRIMES:

Well, there would be nothing to

16 pre-empt here, because, I mean, with the Section 28(a) of
17 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
18

QUESTION:

I mean, supposing Congress

simply had

19 not gotten into this field at all, and left it to the
20 states, the same way that it had attempted to preserve state
21 blue sky laws in the 1934 or 1933 legislation.

Do you think

22 that the Seventh Circuit would have come out the same way as
23a burden on interstate commerce, a constitutional, straight
24 constitutional holding, without any action of Congress?
25

MR. GRIMES:

I am not sure, Justice Rehnguist.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

I

1 think in that situation, the Seventh Circuit could have gone
2 to the commerce aspect, if there were no Congressional
3 legislation in the field.
4

QUESTION;

Well, it certainly could have.

Do you

5 think it would have been proper under the decisions of this
6 Court for it to have done so?
7

MR. GRIMES;

Well, I would recognize you avoid

8 reaching -- you know, deciding on the constitutional issue
9 if any other ground is possible, but of course, even when
10 something is pre-empted you are still under -- it would be
11 unconstitutional under the supremacy clause.

I am not sure

12 exactly -13

QUESTION;

But if there weren’t any claim of

14 statutory pre-emption, just a straight commerce clause
15 argument, wouldn’t the commerce clause argument be the same
16 whether or not the Williams Act existed?
17

MR. GRIMES:

I think the commerce clause issue

18 would be the same regardless -19

QUESTION:

Well, if it was, if it were the same,

20 wouldn’t it have been decided the same, whether or not the
21 Williams Act was in the picture?
22

MR. GRIMES:

I think the commerce clause would --

23 the commerce -24

QUESTION:

That's what the Justice is asking you.

25

MR. GRIMES:

Yes, the commerce clause issue stands

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

n>

1 or falls regardless of the Williams Act.

I mean, that is

2 there even -- I mean, my first argument is that it is not
3 pre-empted by the Williams Act, and then the commerce clause
4 analysis will stand or fall on its own.
5

QUESTION:

But there are two separate points.

6

MR. GRIMES:

Definitely two separate points.

The

7 Seventh Circuit I feel correctly determined that Congress
8 has not expressly barred states from coordinate regulation
9 of tender offers, and even this Court has said in Section
1028(a) that the 1934 Act was designed to preserve state
11 authority as opposed to limit it.
12

Similarly, the Court of Appeals in its decision

13 correctly determined that Congress -- the Williams Act is
14 not a pervasive scheme of legislation from which the
15 Illinois Act could be implicitly pre-empted.
16

QUESTION:

Mr. Grimes, I guess if you consider the

17 SEC's new rules on the subject, you would conclude that it
18 was indeed pre-empted, would you not?
19

MR. GRIMES:

Well, the new rules, which of course

20 are not at issue here, create a direct conflict with a
21 portion of the Illinois Act, in that under the SEC rule it
22 has to commence or be withdrawn within five days, whereas
23 the Illinois Act has a 20-day pre-commencement.

But as far

24 as -- although, as I still would submit, the new rule does
25 not apply to this case, we do have examples of other very

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 current

state amendments to their statutes, such as New York

2 and Maryland,

where you would not have that direct conflict

3 in the sense that it would be impossible to comply with
4 both.

That would be -- that specific portion -- provision

5 of the Illinois Act does conflict directly with the new SEC
6 rule.

7

The Court of Appeals said that the Illinois Act

8 stands as an

obstacle to achieving the full Congressional

9 purposes in enacting the Williams Act, in conflicts under
10 the Hines versus Davidowitz test.

The Court of Appeals had

11 four main objections that it found

with the Illinois Act.

12

It said

that the Illinois Act would substitute

%,i0

13 regulatory control for investor autonomy; that a hearing
14 could be instituted indirectly by incumbent management;

and

15 that the Illinois Act provides for delays grossly -16 potentially grossly in excess of those contemplated under
17 the Williams Act;

and finally, the pre-commencement, 20-day

18 pre-commencement notification period.
19

It is the State of Illinois' position that the

20 Illinois Act ensures that an investor will have an adequate
21 opportunity

to make an informed decision, and it also

22 ensures that there

will be full compliance with the

23 disclosure requirements in the Williams Act.
24

This Court has said that the sole purpose of

25 Congress in enacting the Williams Act was to protect the

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 investor confronted with a tender offer.

Now, there are

2 expressions of Congressional neutrality in the legislative
3 history of the Williams Act, but I think it is a -- I
4 believe it is a mistake to believe that general neutrality
5 as opposed to setting an unalterable balance -- I think
6 those are two different things.
7

If in fact the Williams Act created a balance that

8 could not be altered, then I think it is the situation now
9 where the SEC has greatly increased the minimum time a
10 tender offer must remain open to 20 business days.

If it

11 were an absolute balance in the Williams Act, that these
12 terms were fixed, then I don't think the SEC could change
13them.

Instead, I think it is more a feeling of general

14 neutrality.

They don't want to prevent tender offers from

15 being made, but as long as the Illinois Act will not have
16 the effect of precluding the making of tender offers, it can
17 exist with the Williams Act by supplementing the protection
18 afforded an investor.
19

With the question -- Certainly the Illinois Act is

20neutral.

It applies to the activities of the target company

21 as well as those of the offeror.

Its specific purpose says

22it is to be interpreted so as to strike a balance that does
23 not favor either management or the target company.
24 no exemption for a

25

It has

friendly takeover.

Setting into the Seventh Circuit's problems that

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 there would be the delay under the Act that would conflict
2 with the purpose of Congress, there is no question speed and
3 surprise are to the benefit of an offeror, but that doesn't
4 follow that that is to the benefit of the investor
5 confronted with a tender offer.
6

The investor's right to make an informed decision,

71 believe this is furthered when you have reasonable delay
8 because that investor then will have an opportunity to see
9 what value the market places on the tender offer that has
10 been made for his shares.

To wit, if another company would

11 come in with a competing bid, that would be an indication of
12 what the true value of his shares are.

There is certainly

13 nothing in the record to show that the periods of delay in
14 the Illinois Act would hinder the making of tender offers,
15 and I think we certainly have seen that in the period of
16 time since the SEC has increased virtually by 400 percent
17 from the seven-day minimum period when it is a tender offer
18for all the shares under the Williams Act to now 20 business
19 days, which would be approximately four weeks , there has
20 certainly been no slackening in the making of tender offers
21

What about the authority of the

QUESTION t

22 Illinois commissioner to hold a hearing?
23

MR. GRIMES:

The hearing provisions of the Act

24which the seventh circuit found again to be delay, and there
25 is -- I would have to agree that under the wording of the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 flet, incumbent management perhaps indirectly could cause a
2 hearing
3 the

to be held as required by -- if it is 10 percent of

shareholders or a majority of the outside directors.

4

Now, the Securities Commissioner is there to

5 protect the

interests of the Illinois residents who are

6 shareholders.

He is not going to be a pawn of either the

7 target company

or the offeror.

8 limits,
9 power

The Act does contain time

although it says that the Secretary would have the

to extend them if necessary like for the protection of

10 Illinois offerees.

11

But the point is, if the Secretary conducts a

12 hearing,

if he sees -- the purpose of the Illinois Act,

13 ensure that

there has been the full disclosure, and at that

14 point the Secretary
15 think we could
16 pawn
17 time,
18 into

isn't going to be subject, and I don't

assume that the Secretary is going to be a

of the target company.

The hearing at a very early

much as if -- if the target company presently would go
the district court to seek a temporary restraining

19 order or

anything else.

20 achieved by having
21 the Williams Act or
22 has been made,
23 obstacle
24

to

I think it is the same thing being

a hearing at an early stage to see that
the disclosure under the Illinois Act

and in that event it is not going to be an

to the tender offer going ahead.
QUESTION:

25 Secretary concludes

But, Hr. Grimes, supposing the Illinois
that although there has been complete

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and thorough disclosure, everything has been disclosed that
2 could possibly be disclosed, nevertheless, in his judgment
3 the offer was inequitable, what happens then?
4

MR. GRIMES:

Okay.

This provision is the one that

5 the Second Circuit said that it found most objectionable.
6First, I would point out,

the Secretary has contended, our

7 position has been throughout this litigation, that he
8 doesn't have the power to pass on the substantive fairness
9 or the amount of the offer.

I did include a case in my

10 brief, an Illinois Supreme Court case, which said -- well,
11 first of all, to give you the language, the Secretary has
12 the power to deny registration if he finds that a takeover
13 offer is "inequitable or would work or tend to work a fraud

%

14 or deceit."

I did argue that this should be construed in

15 the conjunctive as opposed -- the "or" to be construed
16"and", that it is -- fraud or deceit.
17

Now, I recognize that certai nly in more

18 traditional state blue sky law,

where they do pass on

19 substantive fairness and "inequitable" is used in that, that
20 it -- I mean, that this could be reaso nably construed as
21 passing on substantive fairness.

I -- we contend, though,

22 that that is counter to the purpose of the Act.
23

No, but is it not clear that Judge

QUESTION:

24Cudahy so construed it?
25

MR. GRIMES:

Oh, absolutely.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

And are we not bound to accept the

2 Court of Appeals construction of the Illinois statute?

Do

3 we go behind them and take a second look at what the
4 Illinois statute means?
5

MR. GRIMES;

Well, Judge Cudahy in his opinion

6 didn’t even point out that we argued
7 the Secretary.
8 brief here,

that it didn't entitle

I cite in my brief in response, in my reply

I cited the portion of our brief in the Seventh

9 Circuit where we argued that it did not possess -- we do not
10 possess this power.
11 that.
12

The Seventh Circuit didn’t comment on

He quoted a different portion.
QUESTION;

It is very clear he disagreed with you,

13 and the fact that you raised the point seems to me kind of
14 cuts against you in a way.

If it was argued and he

15 construed it differently, that seems to me all the more of a
16 hurdle for you to overcome.
17

MR.

GRIMES;

Well, the point being that we don't

18 feel we have the power to pass on the substantive fairness.
19 The Illinois Act does have a severability provision.

We

20 don't contend -- we think that is counter to the purpose of
21 the Williams Act to pass on the substantive fairness.

That

22 is the investor’s decision, adequate time, full disclosure,
23 and ensure that at an early stage.
24

But in getting back to what I was saying about

25 more like a traditional state blue sky law, I mean, that is

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 a different situation

If a new issuing is being made in

2 Illinois, and an investor is putting up dollars for a stock
3

certificate, you have an inherent risk that you could lose

4

everything, whereas I think a cash tender offer is a

5

different situation*

The Illinois investor is giving up his

6 share of stock for -- well, if it is a cash tender offer for
7

all the shares -- for some certain -- I would say that the

8 purpose of the Illinois Act, unless it could — you know,
9

4

*5-

the Illinois Supreme Court decision is authority that "or"

10

can be construed as "and", and in this situation I feel that

11

it would be counter to the purpose of the Act to have the

12

power of substantive review, of the fairness, substantive

13

fairness review.

14

If that power is there, it is one that the

15

Secretary, in the position of the Attorney General’s office,

16

is that the legislature didn't intend that.

17

don’t see that that could withstand scrutiny.

18
19

QUESTION:

If it did, I

General Grimes, did the Secretary seek

a stay of the injunction issue by the district court?

20

MR. GRIMES:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. GRIMES:

No, it did not seek a stay.
Why?
There had -- I filed the notice of

23

appeal in this case.

Some time after we fi led the notice of

24

appeal, that — of course, then when Mite w ithdrew its

25

tender offer -- I know in prior litigation that happened a

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 couple months before this there had been -- a stay was
2 sought there in Daylin -- or UARCO versus Daylin.

Stay was

3 sought and denied in the Seventh Circuit, and also, I
4 believe, denied by this Court.
5

QUESTION:

Are you going to address somewhere

6 along the line the suggestion that the case is moot?
7

MR. GRIMES;

Yes, I will be glad to address it.

8 The main reason why I feel that this case is not moot -9 this was raised for the first time by Mite in the response
10 to the jurisdictional statement -- is this.

At present, the

11 Secretary of State is still permanently enjoined -12

QUESTION:

Are you criticizing that it was raised

13 then for the first time?
14

MR. GRIMES;

No.

No, no, but I am just pointing

15 out that the Seventh Circuit, although it addressed it, it
16 was not argued there, but -- because, I mean, I realize it
17 makes no difference when it is raised, as to something like
18 mootness.

But at present the Illinois Secretary of State is

19 enjoined from applying the Illinois Business Takeover Act
20 against Mite Corporation.
21

QUESTION:

Or to any --

22

MR. GRIMES:

Well, the specific -- the specific

23 injunction was -24

QUESTION;

Where there is a declaration of

25 unconstitutionality anyway.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MB. GRIMES*

Right.

It would not have been

2 enforced in the actions, but back to that question.

If the

3 Illinois Secretary of State would, for example, bring an
4 action seeking civil penalty against Kite for publishing its
5 tender offer in the Wall Street Journal on February 5th,
61979, after it obtained the injunctive relief, the Secretary
7 of State would be in contempt of that permanent injunction.
8

QUESTION;

Well, how can Mite be held when

9 everything it did was under the protection of an injunction?
10

MR. GRIMES;

Well, I would still -- I am arguing,

11 at least I argued in my reply brief that the Act provides
12 for both criminal and civil penalties.

Since it provides

13 for civil, I don’t think it is necessary obviously to reach
14 any consideration of criminal.

Most of the cases Mite cited

15 in its reply brief for all of them we are dealing in a
16 situation of criminal penalties.
17

In one case cited by them, Kratz versus Kratz,

18 though, the court in that held that the fact that it does
19 not follow that in a civil case reliance upon judicial
20 opinion instructing that the conduct is legal must be
21 available as a defense in a civil case, and we have -- and I
22 don't think -23

QUESTION;

It isn't an opinion.

It's a flat

24 injunction here that protects them.
25

MR. GRIMES;

Well, but in Leroy versus Great

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Western United Corporation, they had completed their tender

2 offer after obtaining injunctive relief, but this Court

3 said, that acquisition did not moot the case, however,
4 because the question whether Great Western has violated
5 Idaho statute will remain open unless and until the district
6 court’s judgment is finally

7

QUESTION;

affirmed.

Well, they --

I take it you are arguing that you want

8 to retaint the right to collect

civil penalties for

9 violation of the statute, and that the judgment below was
10 just plain wrong,
11 collect
12

and you want it set aside so you can

civil penalties.
MR. GRIMES ;

We are curren tly enjoined from

13 b ringing an action f or ci^/il penalti es.

Only if we prevai

14 in this Court can we then bring that action.
15 are enjoined from doing so.
16

QUESTION;

We curren tly

I feel that if --

I want to be sure about one fact.

Mite

17 never acquired any shares of Chicago Rivet?
18

MR. GRIMES;

Mite withdrew its tender offer on

19 March 5th on its own.
20

QUESTION;

It never acquired any shares of Chicago

21 Rivet?
22

MR. GRIMES;

23

QUESTION;

Correct.
It also agreed not to acquire any in

24 the future.
25

MR. GRIMES;

With their -- their agreement, yes,

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 with Chicago Rivet.
2

QUESTION;

So there is no likelihood that Mite

3 will make any effort to take over Chicago Rivet again?
4

QUESTION;

They have agreed not to.

5

MR. GRIMES;

They made an agreement with Chicago

6 Rivet that when they -- they had a proposed, I guess,
7 amendment to their tender offer for $31 a share, and that if
8 for any reason they didn't go ahead with that they agreed
9 not to make a future attempt.
10

QUESTION;

Mr. Grimes, doesn't that distinguish

11 this case from Leroy?

There the acquisition had actually

12 been completed, had it not?
13

MR. GRIMES;

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. GRIMES;

16

QUESTION;

The acquisition had been completed.
And here it was not.
But the fact —
And there is a promise that it will

17 never come to pass.
18

MR. GRIMES;

19

QUESTION;

I agree that -What I am really trying to get at, what

20is the basis of any liability under the Illinois statute in
21 these circumstances?
22

MR. GRIMES;

The basis for the liability would

23have been making the tender offer without getting it
24registered under the Illinois Act.
25

QUESTION;

Even though they have now withdrawn it?

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HR. GRIMES;

Even though they have now withdrawn

2 it, they made it without getting it registered under the
3 Illinois Act.

They were able to do so on the basis of their

4 injunctive relief, but we are still dealing with the civil
5 sort of penalty, and I don't see how that is much different,
6 because in Leroy they acquired -7

QUESTION;

Well, there wasn't any question, the

8 acquisition had gone through and it was claimed in defiance
9 of the prohibitions of the state statute.
10

HR. GRIMES;

But the fact that they acted under an

11 injunction in Leroy wouldn't have insulated them if — let’s

8 prove a past violation, at least theoretically an Illinois
9 court can enter an injunction against Mite ever doing it

It's like a cease and desist order.

I am suggesting that

5 say that they would have a defense on the merits, or that
6 they would ultimately prevail.
7

QUESTION;

You are saying that it is moot only if

8 the state is deprived of its right to collect a civil

11

MR. GRIMES;

I think that saves it from mootness

12 that we are presently enjoined.

The Act has been -- you

13 know, we can’t apply the Act against Mite, although they
14 were able to go ahead with their publishing of the tender
15 offer without getting it registered.
16

QUESTION;

Do you think you would be in violation

17 of the injunction if you applied the Act to some other
18 company?
19

MR. GRIMES:

The injunction itself only applied to

20 the Secretary of State, Mite, and Chicago Rivet.

There is a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF EUGENE D. BERMAN, ESQ.,

4

AMICUS CURIAE

5

MR. BERMAN*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

6 the Court, New York believes that Illinois through its
7 tender offer statute serves, if it is allowed to, with the
8 reversal of the decision below, a vital function in
9 shareholder protection.

That shareholder protection is

10 similar to protections now accorded shareholders under some
11 36 other state laws.

Those states have decided that this

12 protection is necessary.
13

If I may, I would like to discuss briefly the

14 experience of New York under its takeover statute.
15 has had a tender offer statute since 1976.

New York

After the new

16 SEC regulations took effect in 1980 , New York determined not
17 to be in a conflict situation with Rule 14(d)(2), and
18 therefore made extensive amendments to its Act, so that
19 under the New York Act there is no longer a pre-offer
20 waiting period.
21

New York believes that the state has a legitimate

22 interest in regulating tender offers to protect
23 shareholders.

Since New York's Act became effective, there

24 have been 44 filings.

Twenty-three filings were made since

25 the 1980 amendments, and of those,

16 have been made so far

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 this year.

New York has never ultimately prevented a tender

2 offer from being commenced or consummated through
3administrative action.
4

The function of the New York Attorney General is

5 to determine whether or not there has been full disclosure,
6 and once that determination is made, either that there is
7 full disclosure, and the offer is allowed to proceed on its
8 own course, or is not, and an amendment is required, the
9 offer then continues in the same manner as it would under
10 the Williams Act.
11

N ew York has had four public hear ings, two before

12 and two after the

1980 amen dments.

Of those public

13 hea rings, none: lasted for m ore than two- day s.

It is New

14 Yor k’s experience that stat e legislatio n in this area does
15 not frustrate Congress i onal objectives in t he William s Act.
16

QUESTION:

What, Mr.

Berman, was the subject of

17 the public hea rings?
18

ME . BERMAN;

Ther e were four publ ic hearing s.

Th

19 subject in all of them was whether unde r th e specific tende
20 off er in quest ion the offer or had made full and fair
21 dis closure of all mate rial terms.
22

QUESTION:

B ef ore whom were t hose hearings?

23

MR. BERMAN:

Thos e were held bef o re the New York

24 Sta te Attorney General •
25

New York bel ieves that the st ate has a legitimate

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 state interest in regulating tender offers.

A tender offer

2 is, after all, a bid to acquire control of a corporation.
3 In the case before this Court, Mite sought 100 percent of
4 the Chicago Rivet shares.
5 Chicago Rivet.

It sought, in essence, to buy

The state has a traditional interest in

6 regulating affairs of corporations with respect to purchases
7 of that corporation, analogous to merger transactions or
8 major asset sales.
9

As this Court has noted in Cort against Ash, the

10 corporation is a creature of state statute.

Shareholders

11 invest in a corporation knowing that the very existence of
12 the corporation and their relationship with that corporation
13 will be governed by state law.
14

QUESTION:

Mr. Berman, as I read the last

15 paragraph of the Seventh Circuit's opinion, it doesn’t say
16 that there can be no state legislation in this field.

It

17 simply says that the Illinois statute does not conform to
18 either the pre-emption or interstate commerce burden
19 requirements.

Isn't it conceivable that whereas perhaps

20 they are correct about the Illinois statute, perhaps the New
21 York or other statute might pass muster, even under the
22 Seventh Circuit's opinion?
23

MR. BERMAN:

That is absolutely correct, and as

24 Your Honor notes, that area seems to have been reserved by
25 the Seventh Circuit in its opinion.

However, there are

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 certain aspects of the Seventh Circuit opinion, namely, what
2 it refers to as the potential for delay under the Illinois
3 statute, which must be addressed.
4

The state tender offer statutes have one thing in

5 common for the most part, all save Delaware’s, and that is a
6 period of time during which the neutral state administrator
7 will look at the offer to determine whether or not it
8 complies with the statute.

That is, whether there is full

9 and fair disclosure in the case of New York and Illinois.
10

Although the Seventh Circuit leaves the

11 possibility of some state statute remaining in effect, it
12 does not define what that might be.

For example, we could

13 speculate a state statute which merely parrots the language
14 of the Williams Ret, not being a burden on interstate
15 commerce, but in that context there would be no independent
16 regulatory review of the disclosures in the specific tender
17offers as exist now under the state takeover statutes.
18

Therefore, a key element which New York believes

19must be addressed is whether there is a legitimate interest
20in the states to have an independent regulatory review of
21 the disclosures at some point either prior to or during the
22existence of a tender offer.
23

QUESTION;

Are you saying that if Congress had

24 said in the Williams Act there shall be no review in the
25 states of the terms of an offer, of the fairness of the

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 terms, that that would be unconstitutional?
2

MR. BERMAN i

3

QUESTION;

Excuse me, if Congress had said -And said expressly that the states may

4 not do what Illinois attempted to do here.
5
61 may.

MR. BERMAN;

Well, let me answer that this way, if

The states may not do what Illinois is alleged to

7 have felt it could do, that is, regulate the fairness.
8

QUESTION;

Well, what the Seventh Circuit thought

9 it was doing.
10

MR. BERMAN;

11

QUESTION;

12 authority?

Yes.
Well, would Congress have that

To say that expressly?

And make it stick?

Is

13 that your argument or not?
14

MR. BERMAN;

15 that argument.

Well, Congress certainly has not made

I frankly am not certain whether the

16 interstate commerce authority extends to such a point where
17 Congress -18

QUESTION t

Well, what if it did?

19

MR. BERMAN;

20

QUESTION;

Well, if it did, then yes.
Well, then, yes, but then what about --

21 would that have any implications for your present argument?
22

MR. BERMAN;

But that would be a pre-emption

23 Question and not a commerce clause question.
24

QUESTION;

Yes.

Yes.

25

QUESTION;Certainly the

Shreveport rate cases

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 said that Congress in exercising its power over interstate
2 railroad transportation could regulate to a certain extent
3 railroad transportation simply within a state, did it not?
4

MR. BERMAN;

We do not question the fact that

5 Congress does have the authority to regulate commerce and to
6 regulate commerce within a state, within the commerce clause
7 direction of regulating commerce among the states.

However,

8 in the case of the state tender offer statutes, we are given
9a different situation entirely.
10

The role of state regulation of securities

11 transactions and the role of the state regulation of
12 internal affairs of corporations is one which has been
13 traditional, and traditionally upheld by this Court.

It is

14 very different from the instance of transportation, such as
15 railroads or interstate commerce on highways going through
16the states, and we contend that the slight delay which may
17be imposed by the Illinois statute is indeed not a burden on
18interstate commerce.

It does not prevent the tender offer's

19ultimate consummation.

It merely delays the tender offer

20until such point as there can be a determination of fair
21 disclosure, and that fair disclosure is the same disclosure
22 which is required by the Williams Act.
23

In essence, the states have felt in this area that

24 the Williams Act is a minimum disclosure statute akin to the
25 various other federal securities laws.

In fact, the

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 legislative history of the Williams Act indicates that its
2 purpose or the purpose of the drafters was to fill the gap
3 in federal regulation of securities in this area.

At that

4 time, the tender offer was unregulated by federal law.
5

QUESTION;

What do you make of the colloquy

6 between Senator Javits and Senator Williams on the floor
7 where Senator Javits asked Senator Williams, the purpose of
8 this Act is not to discourage tender offers, is it?
9 Senator Williams said, no, not indeed.

And

Some of them may be

10 -- I am just paraphrasing -- beneficial.
11

HR. BERMAN;

Yes.

That is true.

12 several benefits which may be said.

There are

I believe in then SEC

13 Chairman Emanuel Cohn’s testimony before Congress, he
14 mentioned that there are indeed some instances where tender
15 offers would be beneficial because the incumbent management
16 is inefficient, but Chairman Cohn realized that a tender
17 offer is in essence a corporate opportunity due to a
18 depressed stock market price.

An offeror is able to buy a

19 bargain.
20

For example, a stock trading at $25 may have an

21 actual value of $100.

The mere delay in a tender offer

22 statute is not going to impede an offeror from buying
23something for $25 that is worth $100.

It has been our

24 experience in New York, with our statute in existence for
25 some several years, that tender offers are not frustrated by

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 our statuta.

Indeed, they seam to be flourishing, and are

2 dependent more on outside economic market factors than on
3 any regulation, ba it federal or state.
4

A question had been raised while Mr. Grimes was

5 addressing the Court concerning the Seventh Circuit's
6 finding that the Illinois statute regulated fairness.

New

7 York respectfully suggests that the Seventh Circuit misread
8a statement in the Illinois brief before it.

The statement

9 by the court that Illinois defends the fairness review by
10 referring to impartial review by a state administrator is
11 not what was stated in the brief as is cited in both the
12 Illinois reply brief and New York's brief as amicus.
13

Indeed, in those briefs, it was -- in that brief,

14 it was specifically stated that the Illinois Secretary of
15 State does not interpret the statute so as to regulate for
16fairness, and the brief specifically mentions the word
17 "price" there.

Illinois would not say whether or not it is

18a good price, and I believe there was a misreading of that
19statement by the Seventh Circuit which led to its conclusion,
20

QUESTION;

Well, but the statute on its face is

21 consistent with the Seventh Circuit's reading.

It does say,

22the Secretary does not find that the offer is inequitable,
23 and how does one read the word "inequitable" except to
24 indicate some interest in the fairness of the bargain?

I

25don't care what the -- I mean, I don't know, I don't have

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the briefs before the Court; we just have the opinion and
2 the language of the statute, and the Court of Appeals'
3 reading of the statutory language is certainly not
4 manifestly untenable.

MR. BERMAN;

It is not manifestly untenable in and

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

9

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD W. HULBERT, ESQ.,

10

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

11

MR. HULBERT:

Mr. Hulbert?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

12 the Court, there are two issues on the merits here, the
13 constitutionality of the Illinois Business Takeover Act on
14 commerce clause grounds, and the constitutionality of it on
15 supremacy clause grounds.
16

The Court of Appeals held it invalid on both

17 counts, and in that respect aligned itself with
18 substantially every decision by a federal court on the
19 merits of those questions as they have arisen with respect
201 o state laws such as Illinois'.

We submit that decision

21 should be affirmed.
22

The merits of these questions have been rather

23elaborately briefed to this Court two years ago in the Leroy
24 case.

They have been the subject of three very lengthy and

25 thoughtful decisions of Courts of Appeals of the Third, the

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Fifth, and the Seventh Circuits, and they have been the
2 subject of a mountain of commentary in the legal literature
3 and in the financial and more practical press, if one may
4 put it tha t way.
5

One would certainly be rather temeritous in

6 supposing that one could add any great deal of enlightenment
7 to this question in the half an hour allowed for oral
8 argument.

I do think, that there are elements in the facts

9 of this case which will illustrate in a
10 how these laws, this law, Illinois'

specific way exactly

law does in truth burden

11 interstate commerce and create a good deal of confusion and
12 delay, subject a tender offeror to the prospects of the
13 conflicting commands of different sovereigns, and in general
14 act in a way which, so far as I am aware, no state assertion
15 of legislative jurisdiction in the history of the country
16 has ever purported to act.
17

QUESTION:

Mr. Hulbert, let me ask you, supposing

18 that Congress had never legislated in this field at all.
19 Would you feel that the Seventh Circuit opinion is
20 sustainable solely because the Illinois statute is an
21 unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce?
22

MR. HULBERT;

Justice Rehnguist, I think the

23 answer to that question is yes, and for the reason that
24 unlike Illinois and other state regulation in the blue sky
25 area, the Illinois statute is a global regulation of any

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Illinois corporation, its principal executive office is in
2 Illinois, and somewhat under a quarter of its stockholders
3 are Illinois residents.

So there is no question that the

4 statutory tests were satisfied on several alternative
5 grounds.
6

What distinguishes these statutes, and what I

7 think raises the constitutional question is the insistence
8 that regulation to be effective must be national, indeed,
9 must be international, that there is no such thing as
10 effective local regulation of a tender offer.

I don't know

11 whether that is right or wrong, but it is insisted in the
12 briefs amicus filed on behalf of the appeal here that
13 Illinois is justified in regulating worldwide, because
14 unless it regulates worldwide, it can't effectively regulate
15 at all, and that seems to me, one really has to go back to
16 the nineteenth century, I think, to find judicial discussion
17 of the characteristics of subjects appropriate for the
18 national power and subjects appropriate for the state power.
19

There is language, for example, in the decision in

20Cooley against the Board of Wardens a century and a quarter
21 ago saying, "Whatever subjects of this power are in their
22 nature national or admit only of one uniform system or plan
23 of regulation, may justly be said to be of such a nature as
24 to require exclusive legislation by Congress."
25

What Illinois has, on the contrary, proposed to do

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 in this case by enacting this statute, and what every other
2 state, I think, that has done so likewise proposes it has
3 the right to do, is to impose an absolute veto on a tender
4 offer occurring anywhere in the world provided the
5 jurisdictional contacts, and they vary from state to state,
6 and one of the issues that arose in this case was exactly
7 what the Pennsylvania statute meant when it said principal
8 place of business in Pennsylvania.
9

QUESTION:

Mr. Hulbert, don't your arguments,

10 though, about extraterritoriality really condemn a number of
11 state laws, like state antitrust laws or statutes requiring
12 corporations to use cumulative voting, and things like that,
13 that apply certainly beyond the borders of the state?
14

MR. HULBERT:

I am not sure about antitrust laws.

151 don't know that a state has really ever attempted to
16regulate on an antitrust basis apart from a concern that the
17 impact of the transaction is local, and as far as cumulative
18voting and other incidents of the relations between
19 stockholders and a corporation, I agree.
20

QUESTION:

Or how about merger requirements?

21

MR. HULBERT:

I agree that where one is dealing

22 with something that can fairly be classified as a matter of
23internal affairs of a corporation, it has as a matter of

24 tradition and necessity been referred to state law, there
25having been at no time in our history a federal law of

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 incorporation, and in the interest of fairness and
2 predictability and certainty there has to be a law to which
3 questions can be referred,

and our practice historically has

4 been to refer those questions to the law of the state of
5 incorporation.
6

QUESTION:

Don't many of those in effect have

7 extraterritorial application?
8

MR. HULBERT:

Sure.

They do.

The problem here is

9 that you can have four or five states, at least in concept,
10 and in this case two states argued by Mite, there were two
11 states here, each of which
12

QUESTION;

--

Well, your last reply to Justice

13 O'Connor intimates that you are arguing the case to all the
14 judges of England sitting in Westminster, where under a
15 written constitution which gives some powers to Congress,
16 leaves others to the states, gives other powers to the
17 individuals.

I mean, it isn't a question just of what the

18 nine members of this Court happen to think should be the
19 proper mode of regulation.
20

MR. HULBERT:

That is certainly accurate,

but it

21 seems to me that under the Constitution of the United
22 States,

the assertion by the state of Illinois of the power

23 to regulate on a global basis, as it does in this Act, is
24 impermissible, just as -- answering your original question
25as to whether taking the commerce clause issue quite apart

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 from the issue of pre-emption one would come out where the
2 Seventh Circuit came out.
3

QUESTION;

That doesn’t --

4

MR. HULBERT;

That obviously does not answer the

5 full issues presented by the case, because there is also the
6 pre-emption argument, but it does seem to me that these
7 statutes are sharply distinguishable from the blue sky laws.
8

QUESTION;

And would you agree that that doesn't

9 involve federal judges deciding whether the Williams Act or
10 the Illinois Act is the better of the two for the protection
11 of investors?
12

MR. HULBERT;

Certainly if one goes off on the

13 commerce clause issue, the Williams Act never need be
14 determined.

It seems to me on that issue, to answer your

15question, the unconstitutionality of the Illinois Act is
16quite clear, and it has attempted to be defended on the
17grounds that, well, a tender offer is really like a merger
18or like a proxy fight, and is therefore subject to rules
19 that can safely be analogized to those that apply to the
20internal affairs of a corporation.
21

I think there are three or four answers to that.

22 One of them is that the statute, which contains a
23legislative statement of purpose, says not a word on that
24subject, and while that is obviously not necessarily

25 dispositive, it is surely somewhat indicative.

The location

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of the statute in the consolidated statutes of Illinois is
2 not where you would find it if it were a regulation of
3 corporations.

Along with the Illinois corporation law, it

4 is tacked right onto the Illinois blue sky law.
5

It applies to corporations as to which Illinois

6 has never -- no state has ever, to my knowledge, asserted
7 the right to regulate the internal affairs.

It applies to

8 corporations that are not incorporated under the laws of
9 Illinois as to which Illinois has not heretofore asserted
10 any right to control internal affairs, and lastly, I think
11 it really is not accurate, acceptable to characterize a
12 tender offer which is a purchase of stock as a matter of the
13 internal affairs of a corporation.
14

It may give rise to subsequent relations that do

15 involve the question of internal affairs of a corporation,
16 and there are aspects of conduct associated with the tender
17 offer that presumably are covered by state law.

For

18example, the fiduciary obligations of directors faced with a
19 tender offer.

What may they do?

20money to oppose it?

hay they spend corporate

Is their obligation simply to make sure

21 that the facts are on the table for the stockholders'
22decision?

There is plenty of scope for state law, and it

23 does no disservice to the solid notions of state
24responsibility in the sphere of economic regulation properly
25 assigned to states to hold that in this case Illinois has

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 gone much too far simply on commerce clause grounds alone.
2

If one turns to the second branch of the argument,

3 which is the issue as to pre-emption, I think the facts of
4 this case will cast in some higher light some of the
5 assertions that have been made with respect to the relations
6 between the Illinois law and the Williams Act.
7 that Illinois imposes a slight delay.

It is said

Well, the fact of the

8 matter is that at the time this tender offer was proposed to
9 be made in January, 1979, as a matter of Federal law, it
10 could have been made in seven days, and as a matter of
11 Illinois law it could not possibly have been made in less
12 than eight weeks, the 20-day pre-commencement period of
13uncetainty mandated by the law and the 20 business days that
14 the offer at a minimum had to be kept open.
15

In addition, there are the hearing provisions

16 which have been referred to, and given the usually combative
17 nature of these transactions, it can safely be assured that
18where a hearing can be requested it will be.

The hearing

19 itself adds a minimum of another additional five weeks.

The

20ten days within which the Secretary is to commence the
21 hearing after he has been asked to do so, and that date he
22 is allowed to extend without any stated limit of time.

Then

23 there is a 15 business day period after the conclusion of
24 the hearing in which the Secretary is to render a decision,
25although that period likewise can be extended without any

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 stated limit of time, and then of course there is the time
2 required for the hearing itself.
3

If these procedures were strung out with any

4 ingenuity at all, with half the ingenuity that was displayed
5 in the various maneuvers that in truth went on, you would be
6 confronting something 16, 18 weeks, half a year, seven
7 months, and if one contrasts that on the one hand with one
8 week, which was the period under which an offer -- within
9 which an offer could be made under the Williams Act, it
10 seems to me one cannot refer to this in terms of slight
11 delay.

It is a gross alteration of the whole terms of the

12 transaction.

It ceases to be something recognizable to any

13 draftsman of the Williams Act and becomes something -- a
14 horse of an absolutely different color, and indeed probably
15 not a hors? at all.
16

QUESTION:

Do you suggest that it represents a

17 different approach to the whole problem as between the
18 federal and the state?
19

MR. HULBERT:

Mr. Chief Justice, it represents a

20 view by the state of Illinois that on a matter on which
21 Congress has reached one judgment, the state of Illinois is
22 entitled to reach a very different one, and I don't see how
23 it is easily possible to come to the conclusion that that
24 state judgment may stand in the face of —
25

QUESTION:

You would have to include some other

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 States in that, then, too, would you not?
2

MR. HULBERT:

There are -- the limitations of time

3 are not the same under various state statutes.

The New York

4 statute which Mr. Berman spoke of is a very different
5 statute from that which was -- the Illinois statute in issue
6 in this case, and one might, I think, come to all sorts of
7 different conclusions about a number of features of the New
8 York statute that would have no bearing on the conclusion to
9 which one ought to come in this case.
10

The question of the hearing obviously raises the

11 substitution of some administrative judgment in some degree,
12 whether a true review of the literal adequacy of the price
13 in somebody’s mind, but certainly those words must mean
14 something, and they impose a procedure which Congress did
15 not have in mind.
16

There is a --

QUESTION:

Mr. Hulbert, certainly Congress said it

17 wanted to avoid upsetting the balance between the tender
18offerors and the target companies, but does that necessarily
19 mean that Congress objected to letting the states take a
20 different approach, and allowing them to alter the balance?
21 I mean, I don’t know that I see anything in the
22 Congressional scheme that necessarily says to me that
23 although Congress perceived that it wanted to approach it a
24 certain way, that it was hoping to preclude the states from
25 taking a different --

1

MF. HDLBERTi

There is nothing explicit in the

2 Congressional — in the legislative history that really
3 bears -- that exposes any overt understanding by any
4 Congressman on how to deal with these state statutes.

The

5 truth of the matter is that there was only one of them in
6 existence when the Williams Act. was first adopted, and that
7 had been enacted in Virginia two or three months earlier,
8 and I am not sure that Congress was even aware of it, and
9 the spate of state legislation on this subject has really
10 occurred only in the last four or five years, and it may be
11 that Congress is quite satisfied with the fact that these
12 statutes almost invariably are knocked down on
13 constitutional grounds when litigation reaches them.
14 Congress has conferred authority on the Securities and
15 Exchange Commission explicitly in the Williams Act to
16introduce regulatory modifications in the interests of
17 investors, and to a degree in recent regulations the
18 Commission has sought to do so.
19

I am not -- it seems to me that what Congressional

20 exchanges there are do bear on the question, and very
21 clearly bear on the question as to whether Congress thought
22 that it would be permissible state practice or anybody's
23 practice to proceed in such a way as to make a tender offer
24 an immensely long, drawn out thing fraught with peril and
25 therefore much less likely to be made at all, and if made,

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 less likely to be something that a stockholder in the end is
2 ever given a chance to accept.

I don't know whether that gets to the -- I am

afraid Congress has not been as explicit as one might like

in expressing its views about the state statutes.

Well, is a tender offer necessarily to

That seems to be the philosophy behind the

6 Williams Act.
7

MR. HULBFRTi

I think there is a fundamental

8 philosophy that the existence of a capital market unrivaled
9 in the world has been of enormous benefit to this country,
10 reflected not only in the stock exchange but in the fact
11 that securities can be sold in great numbers, bought and
12 traded freely, that mechanisms to increase economic
13 efficiency are of social value, that the possibility that
14 stock can be bought in a way that may exert some impetus on
15 management to exert a more active and effective role in the
16 management of the corporation it seems to me in concept, it
17 would be consistent to conclude that that was of social
18 value, and that tender offer, it seems to me, promotes these
19 several circumstances.
20

QUESTION:

It makes stock more salable.

Is there evidence that conglomerates

21 promote the social good?
22

MR. HULBERTt

I have no evidence that is

23 conclusive about conglomerates.
24

QUESTION;

Is there evidence that tender offers

QUESTIONS

MR. HULBERTi

Excuse me?

-- encourage conglomerates?
I think the question there is

4 probably more a matter of what they do than how they do it.
5 I suppose if one were going to be speculating about control
6 of conglomerates, one would be dealing with an aspect of
7 social judgment that is perhaps more accurately reflected in
8 the general area of the antitrust laws than in the question
9 of the mechanics by which stock is bought and sold.
10

QUESTION:

So there really isn’t any evidence, I

11 take it, any empiric evidence that suggests that the
12 Williams Act, which appears to favor the offeror or the
13 state legislation, which appears to provide more time for
14 the target company to present its views, which of the two
15 approaches is in the public interest.

MR. HULBERTi

Well, Congress has made a judgment,

18

QUESTION;

Yes.

19

MR. HULBERT;

And if you accept what the Seventh

20 Circuit and other courts have inferred to be the judgment
21 implicit in the Williams Act.
22

QUESTION;

Well,

I suppose, however unwise the

23Williams Act may be, if it is constitutional, then it does
24 displace any state law, and that is the end of it for us,
25 however wise or unwise it may be.

MR. HULBERT:

I would have thought that was

2 certainly conventional analysis.
3

QUESTION;

Does not this legislative history

4 reflect some attitude on the part of Congress that there is
5 some utility and value to the public in -6

MR. HULBERT;

It seems to me clearly so.

The

7 exchange between Senators Javits and Williams goes directly
8 to that point.
9

QUESTION;

10 is ambiguous.

Of course, to me, that standing alone

It could mean that Congress just wanted to

11 remain neutral as to tender offers rather than encourage
12 them, and Senator Javits wanted to assure himself that the
13 Williams Act was not going to discourage them.
14

MR. HULBERT;

Yes, but I think there is another

15 point that I haven't yet managed to get to, which I think
16 bears on this question of how free the states ought to be
17 regarded as having been left by Congress to intervene in
18 this area, and that is the problem of conflicting assertions
19 of state jurisdiction over the same tender offer, which
20 arose in this case.
21

The tender offer which was made by Hite, a

22 Delaware corporation doing business in Connecticut and
23lndiana, for stock of Rivet, was the subject of a 75-page in
24 typed form disclosure statement filed with the SEC pursuant
25 to the Williams Act, and in all the claims and charges that

U8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 were subsequently raised in the several litigations that
2 were brought, it was never contended by anybody, by Rivet or
3 by the Secretary of State of Illinois, that there was
4 anything missing or unfairly stated in this disclosure
5 document, or that any further disclosure of any kind would
6 have been of any use to anybody.
7

The only ground of objection Illinois ever did

8 assert was simply the technical one that an application for
9registration had not been made.
10

On the basis of publicly available information, it

11 appeared that Rivet, since it was an Illinois corporation
12 and had its principal place of business in Chicago, would be
13 subject to the Illinois Act.

The Illinois Act had been held

14 unconstitutional not two months before by Judge Collins in
15 the Northern District, and it seemed really a relatively
16 foregone conclusion that if the same case were presented to
17 the Northern District of Illinois on facts that these tender
18offers are very much like one another, there would be almost
19 no prospect that the result would be different.
20

The period of delay occasioned by complying with

21 the Illinois Act and the expense that would undoubtedly be
22incurred in doing so, 16, 18 weeks or what have you, made it
23obviously sensible to initiate the litigation that was
24initiated.

Unbeknownst to us, circumstances with respect to

25Rivet gave rise to the possibility in the minds of its

49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 counsel that an argument could be made that the Pennsylvania
2 Act applied, on the view that the largest single plant of
3 Chicago Rivet was located in Tyrone, Pennsylvania, employing
4 somewhat more than half of the work force, and producing
5 somewhat more than half of the total production, and if that
6 could be fitted within the Pennsylvania statutory phrase,
7 principal place of business, that in conjunction with what
8 seemed obviously enough to satisfy the substantial assets
9 test, which was the other part of the Pennsylvania
10definition, a useful second front might be established
11 against the tender offer by making use of the Pennsylvania
12 statute and the various techniques that could flow from
13 that, so that instead of fighting the Illinois battle on its
14 merits, Rivet and the Secretary of State showed up in court
15 on Monday, the 22nd, and said -- indeed, they moved to
16 dismiss on the grounds there was no case or controversy
17 because they were only relying on the Pennsylvania statute
18 at that point.
19

So, off we all trooped to the snowy hills of

20 western Pennsylvania.
21

QUESTION;

Kind of like a galepoly.

22

MR. HULBERT;

Yes, exactly.

The state court

23 action was removed, and other action was brought.

Rivet

24 applied to the Pennsylvania Securities Commission to take
25 jurisdiction, and all in all, about ten days of time was

50
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 consumed in what might probably have been predicted at the
2 outset and certainly proved in the event to be a fruitless
3 caper, and on February 1, the United States District Court
4 for the Western District of Pennsylvania refused to extend
5 any further the injunctive relief that had been obtained in
6the Pennyslvania state court, and so then the scene moved
7 back to Illinois, where the final determination with respect
8 to the Illinois statute was made, as it could have been
9 predicted at the outset it would have been.
10

Dne point of interest on this conflict is that in

11 the early posture of the case, the Secretary of State, who
12 may not have been a

pawn, but certainly appeared to take no

13 action that was inconsistent with the tactical necessities
14 of Rivet’s position from time to time, asserted in court
15 that he was unclear whether he was going to enforce the
16Illinois Act because of the comity provision which would
17 have permitted him in appropriate circumstances to defer to
18another state administrator if he felt like it, but a day
19 later or so decided that he would not defer to the
20 Pennsylvania Act for reasons which I think show exactly the
21 problem of conflicting state jurisdiction.
22

At Page H-2 of the record, Mr. Shapiro -- another

23 Mr. Shapiro -- appearing as counsel for the Secretary of
24 State, explained that the Secretary of State had decided
25 that he was not going to defer to Pennsylvania.

Because ofcertaindifferences

5 between those two statutes.

The length of time the offer

6 must remain open was different; in Pennsylvania it was 17
7 days, and in Illinois it was 20 business days.

That the

8 provisions for pro-ration were not the same, and that the
ft

9 rights of withdrawal were measured by different periods of
10 time, so that from that point on it was Rivet's position, in
11 effect, that we were to be subjected to two laws, the
12 Pennsylvania Act and the Illinois Act, which at least the
13 Illinois Secretary of State was himself confident could not
14 be readily reconciled, so that he was determined to enforce
15 his, and presumably Pennsylvania was being urged to enforce
16 its, and what were we to do?
17 of withdrawal rights?
18 Pennsylvania?

Whose law governs the duration

Do you apply Pennsylvania law only in

Do you apply Illinois law only in Illinois,

21 intended, it did not intend that, and the possibilities —

MR. HULBERT;

I agree.

If you accept what I think

53

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 is the very forced assertion that tender offers are to be
2 treated as regulation of internal corporate affairs, then
3 the extraterritorial feature ceases to be a significant
4 factor in constitutional analysis, but even there, it seems
5 to me you have got to deal with the fact that these statutes
6 are not stated in jurisdictional terms so as to be mutually
7 exclusive.

The Illinois statute does not apply only to

8 Illinois corporations, and the Pennsylvania statute, indeed
9 Rivet insisted, Rivet, an Illinois corporation, insisted
10 that it was entitled to the protection of the Pennslyvania
11 statute, and they both can't apply if they are to be
12 regarded as nothing more than the regulation of the internal
13 affairs of the corporation.
14

Which one applies?

If the states, I suppose,

15 each agreed

all got together and

to have a series of state laws enacted no two of

16 which would apply to the same circumstance,

you would at

17 least have the possibility of knowledge of what law was to
18 apply, and you might be able to comply with it.

The ALI

19 Federal Securities Code, not enacted, but at one time, I
20 believe, had the support of the Securities and Exchange
21 Commission, would acknowledge the right of a state to
22 regulate tender offers in the circumstance in which more
23 than 50 percent of the stock was owned by local residents
24 and

they owned more than -- and they constituted more than

2550 percent of the shareholders and the corporation was

the

2 corporation noted somewhere so that you could find it as a

matter of public record that it was a corporation that met

5 Appeals to misunderstand it.
6

MR. HULBERT;

And further, we induced the Court of

7 Appeals to misunderstand it.

It seems to me -- well, there

8 are very few cases, and it is not surprising that there are
9 very few, in which people have been prosecuted for doing
10 what they did under the protection of a federal injunction,
11 because there are very few prosecutors that believe that a
12 case for prosecution can remotely be made in such
13 circumstances.
14

The very few cases that do exist suggest you can’t

15 do that, and the implications for constitutional rights in
16 all sorts of areas if an injunction really meant no more
17 than sort of a chip on a wager as to whether the law was
18 eventually going to be sustained in the direction of the
19 judicial pronouncements that underlay the injunction.
20

It seems to me irreparable injury would continue

21 to be irreparable injury, and an injunction in some sense
22would have no meaning, and I can’t believe that would be the
23 result or that indeed in truth an Illinois prosecutor could
24 be found who would think, that that state, which I suppose

25 has as much demand on its prosecutorial resources as any

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO, ESQ.,

6

AMICUS CURIAE

7

MR. SHAPIRO;

Mr. Shapiro.

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

8 may it please the Court, the federal government contends
9 that the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the
10 Illinois takeover statute violates both the commerce clause
11 and the supremacy clause of the Constitution.
12

I would like first to explain why this statute

13 infringes the commerce clause, and then describe how the
14 statute defeats Congress's objectives under the Williams Act.
15

Ever since this Court's ruling in Cooley against

16 Board of Wardens, it has been settled law that the commerce
17 clause places limitations on the power of state authorities
18 to regulate commercial activity.

The federal government is

19 empowered to regulate interstate commerce, the flow of
20 commerce among the states, while the states are empowered to
21 regulate commerce in its local aspects, and when state
22 regulation has the side effect of burdening interstate
23 commerce, that effect is permissible only if it can fairly
24 be described as incidental in nature.
25

QUESTION;

What if Congress passed a statute

58
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 saying that we are going to leave the subject of tender
2 off ers entirely up to the states, and each of them can do
3 wha t they want?
4

MR. SHAPIRO;

It could pass such a statute under

5 the commerce clause if it chose to do so.
6

QUESTION;

And that would be constitutional?

7

MR. SHAPIRO;

It would indeed. Your Honor.

Rather

8 than regulating locally and imposing only an incidental
9 effect on interstate commerce,

the Illinois statute directly

10 governs interstate commerce across the nation in pursuit of
11 its local objective, and this, we submit, is a complete
12 reversal of the state's proper role under the commerce
13 clause.
14

Nationwide tender offers for the shares of

15 publicly traded companies are guintessentially interstate
16 commerce.

The Illinois statute dictates the circumstances

17 under which that commerce may proceed.

It governs offers by

18 bidders to stockholders throughout the country, so long as
19 the target company has certain connections with the state of
20 111 inois .
21

In the present case, this statute would directly

22regulate the actions of a bidder in Delaware that wished to
23 offer $23 million to stockholders across the entire nation.
24The Illinois statute requires the bidder to notify the
25 target company of its confidential tender offer plan, and

59
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 then wait a minimum of four weeks before commencing the
2 offer.

The bidder must also await the result of a hearing,

3 if a hearing is demanded by the target company's outside
4 directors, and the Act imposes no time limit for completion
5 of the hearing.
6

Throughout this entire period, stockholders and

7arbitraguers that wish to sell at the tender offer price are
8 forced to wait and to speculate whether state officials
9 ultimately will grant their consent.

Trading on national

10 securities exchanges also was affected by the announcement
11 of an offer which may never take place, or which may be
12 delayed for an indefinite period of time, and at the end of
13 the entire process, a nationwide offer can be blocked
14 altogether if state officials deem it to be in violation of
15 local law.
16

Under this regime, the commercial freedom of

17 buyers and sellers throughout the country is burdened.

The

18 state of Illinois, far from using its own jurisdiction as a
19 laboratory for economic experimentation, is attempting to
20 use the entire nation as its laboratory.
21

QUESTION:

What if Illinois passed a statute

22saying, it's a crime to deal in stolen goods.

Could

23 somebody come in and argue and say this prevents people in
24 all 50 states from dealing in stolen goods?
25

MR. SHAPIRO:

The analogy would be if Illinois

60
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 passed a law that attempted to regulate the conduct of
2 buyers and sellers in other states and impose penalties
3 based on what is done in Delaware, New York, Kansas, and in
4 places beyond its own borders, and that is precisely what
5 this statute does.
6

QUESTION:

Could Illinois prohibit a Delaware

7 potential seller of a stolen good to someone in Chicago,
8 from selling it to someone in Chicago?
9

HR. SHAPIRO:

Indeed it could.

It could regulate

10a local transaction, but it can’t regulate transactions
11 beyond its boundaries, and that is what this statute does.
12 The decisions of this Court leave little room to doubt that
13 this is in excess of the requirements of the commerce
14 cla use.
15

As the Court stated in Shafer against Farmers

16 Grain Company, and I quote,

"The right to buy in interstate

17 commerce is not a privilege derived from state laws which
18 they may fetter with conditions, but is a common right, the
19 regulation of which is committed to Congress and denied to
20 the states by the commerce clause."

And ever since Shafer,

21 this Court has adhered to the view that individual states
22 may not interfere with the natural functioning of the
23 interstate market either through prohibition or through
24 burdensome regulation.
25

In a case such as this, we submit, which involves

61

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 an attempt by a state to issue commands to buyers and
2 sellers far beyond its borders, there is no need to engage
3 in a weighing of local benefits against interstate burdens,
4 but even if this kind of a weighing test were appropriate,
5 the Illinois statute would not, we submit, survive
6 constitutional scrutiny.

The legislature's stated purpose

7 for this statute is to protect the interests of Illinois
8 security holders through a disclosure, prohibition of fraud,
9 guarantee of withdrawal and pro-ration rights, and provision
10 of time to make a decision.
11

QUESTION:

Mr. Shapiro, under your argument, would

12 the statute be valid if it said no offer may be made to an
13 Illinois resident who owns stock in the target company
14 without complying with the statute?
15

MR. SHAPIRO:

It would be valid under the commerce

16 clause, but it still would have to pass supremacy clause
17 analysis, which I will discuss later, and it would not
18 survive if it had the terms that the present statute does,
19 because it conflicts with Congress's purpose under the
20 Williams Act.

Even Illinois investors, just like investors

21 everywhere, are entitled to the protections of the Williams
22 Act.
23

QUESTION:

Is there any federal requirement that

24if a tender offer is made, it be made to all stockholders?
25 In other words, say you had a statute such as I propose.

62
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Could an offeror make its offer to everyone except Illinois
2 residents?
3
4 possible.

MR. SHAPIRO;

I believe that that would be

There are similarities under the blue sky laws,

5 for example.

The seller of securities may attempt to --

6

QUESTION;

Leave out certain states?

7

ME. SHAPIRO:

-- go around the state that has an

8unhospitable local regime, regulatory regime.
9

QUESTION;

Here this wouldn't escape the Illinois

10statute, because this applies even to transactions between a
11 New York resident and -12

MR. SHAPIRO;

Precisely.

Illinois says that if

13 its connection test is satisfied, that regulations across
14 the country are governed.

We submit that Illinois

15 shareholders already are protected in these very same areas
16 covered by the state statute under the Williams Act, under
17 Congress's chosen standards.

The Williams Act requires

18 disclosure of material facts, forbids fraud, prescribes
19withdrawal and pro-ration rights for all tendering
20 stockholders, and it effectively requires that the tender
21 offer remain open for between seven and ten days, and the
22 SEC has rulemaking authority to flesh out all of these
23 requirements.
24

Since Congress and the SEC have been vigilant in

25 protecting investors, including Illinois investors, the

63
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 additional protection afforded by this statute is entirely
2 speculative, as the Court of Appeals correctly concluded.
3 While counsel has also suggested that Illinois has an
4 interest in regulating control of local companies, this
5 statute does not address any aspect of corporate control
6 that is within the state's jurisdiction.
7

The provisions at issue in this case do not

8 prescribe fiduciary duty for management or controlling
9 persons, but instead focus on sale transactions between
10 stockholders and outsiders in national securities markets.
11 This is not an aspect of the internal affairs of the
12 domestic target company that traditionally is subject to
13 local regulation.
14

In reality, this statute regulates the business of

15 bidders throughout the entire country, not the internal
16 affairs of local target companies.
17

On the other side of the scale, if one were to

18 attempt to apply a weighing test in this case, the Illinois
19 statute severely burdens both buyers and sellers in
20 interstate commerce.

As the Senate report which accompanied

21 the Williams Act stated, pre-commencement waiting periods
22 can delay the offer when time is of the essence, and when
23 Congress passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which was
24 intended to dovetail with the Williams Act, it made the
25 point in the House report that cash tender offers depend on

64
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 speed and surprise to be successful.
2

Congress and the courts have recognized, in short,

3 that pre-commencement delay is a potent weapon to defeat
4 tender offers and deprive shareholders of the opportunity to
5 sell their shares at a premium, and as the facts of this
6 case show, bidders under the state regulatory regime that we
7 are focusing on today must attempt to comply with
8 potentially overlapping state statutes, all of which have
9 extraterritorial coverage.

The number of states that

10 ultimately will assert jurisdiction will not be known at the
11 outset of the offer.
12

This increases confusion, delay, expense, and

13 opportunities for injunctive orders, all of which can
14 severely encumber the planning and the execution of a
15 nationwide tender offer, and if more than one state does
16 ultimately assert jurisdiction, that permits the state with
17 the strictest standards to set the rules for buyers and
18 sellers throughout the entire country.

Illinois has not

19 cited a single local objective that justifies these major
20 burdens on interstate commerce.
21

In addition to exceeding the bounds of its

22authority over local commercial affairs, Illinois has
23 enacted a statute which conflicts with the purposes of
24 Congress under the Williams Act.

In the Williams Act,

25 Congress exercised its plenary power over commerce to

65
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 protect investors across the country*

When it enacted this

2 statute, Congress recognized that tender offers often extend
3 a valuable opportunity to stockholders, and that they
4 frequently serve a useful purpose by providing a check on
5 entrenched but inefficient management.
6

In order to assure full disclosure to stockholders

7 without discouraging or hindering the making of tender
8 offers. Congress adopted a carefully selected strategy.

To

9 achieve its goal, Congress struck a balance between the
10 interests of incumbent management and the bidder, and it
11 permitted each side to fairly present its proposals to
12 public investors.
13

An essential aspect of this regulatory balance is

14 the timetable which Congress prescribed for tender offers.
15 Under Section 14(d) of the statute, a bidder may disclose
16 its plan and begin to solicit shares simultaneously.
17 Congress deliberately rejected the idea that there should be
18 a compulsory delay between announcement and commencement of
19 tender offers.

It concluded that this would frustrate

20 tender offers and disrupt the operation of the national
21 securities markets, results harmful to the best interests of
22 the investing public.
23

This Illinois statute clashes with Congress's

24 timetable and upsets its carefully prescribed balance.
25 Illinois requires bidders to announce their confidential

66

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 plans in advance of the offer, and then wait a minimum of
2 four weeks, and indeed, even longer, if state officials so
3 decree, and while the bidder waits, with its hands tied by
4 state statute, unable to make a soliciation or to present
5 its views about the offer, incumbent management may engage
6 in defensive maneuvers to defeat the offer, including the
7 making of a competing tender offer free of any registration
8 or waiting obligations under Illinois law, and that is
9 precisely what occurred in the present case.
10

Although economic arguments can be fashioned to

11 show that delay sometimes has beneficial side effects, those
12 arguments are quite beside the point in this litigation.

In

13 order to protect investors in the manner that it thought
14 best. Congress adopted a schedule for tender offers and it
15 prescribed a balance for tender offers.

It is not the

16 province of the states to dislodge that balance or to impose
17a schedule which conflicts with the schedule mandated by
18 Congress.
19

For these reasons and the reasons that we have

20 stated in our brief amicus curiae, we request that the
21 decision of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.
22

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUSSELL C. GRIMES,

JR., ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLLAKT - REBUTTAL

67
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. GRIMESj

A couple of remarks, Your Honor.

2

Mr. Shapiro said on a couple of occasions that

3 Congress struck a balance, that the Williams Act already
4 protects shareholders.

Again we are going back to this

5 absolute balance, and we come back to the fact that the SEC
6 even has seen fit to quadruple this balance.

T would point

7 out that under the Williams Act we are focusing on the
8 investor.

I think that the fact Congress at times has

9 amended the Williams Act, has not seen fit to change that.
10 The Illinois Act covers the activities of the target company
11 on a soliciation for or against.

A tender offer must be

12 submitted to the Secretary of State.
13

It is clear that the Illinois Act has incidental

14 extraterritorial effect, but in order to protect the
15 Illinois residents who are shareholders, that all
16shareholders will receive the same protections.
17

Now, in this case here there is not a situation

18 where there were two states who were invoking their tender
19 offers.

The Pennsylvania Securities Commission declined to

20 take jurisdiction with the Pennsylvania Act over this
21 offer.

The Secretary of State, as well as having the comity

22 provision, any burden on interstate commerce, they can
23 accept the federal filing of the 14(d) as compliance with
24 the state Act.
25

And certainly here we have a situation with
