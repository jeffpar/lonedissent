ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. SUTTER, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

9

MR. SUTTER:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

10

the Court, although this case, the Chicago Bridge and

11

Iron case, is of great international significance, it is

12

a case which I submit presents a much simpler questionn

13

than the two cases which immediately preceded it.

14

QUESTION:

Is there not an underlying

15

question, too, as to whether there is any case at all?

16

I assume you will address that.
*

MR. SUTTER:

17

I will indeed, Your Honor.

18

will address that right at the moment, if you would

19

like, sir.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SUTTER:

I

In your own time.
Illinois has a statute permitting

22

intervention.

In this particular instance, the

23

litigation began between Caterpillar and the State of

24

Illinois.

25

believing that the issue of the constitutionality of

However, the client which I represent,

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

worldwide combined reporting, would not be presented in

2

that controversy, because both sides assumed the

3

constitutionality of worldwide combined reporting,

4

sought leave to intervene.

5

granted, and was affirmed by all of the Illinois courts.

6

That intervention was

Under the Illinois statute, an intervenor has

7

all of the rights of an original party, including the

8

right to oppose both of the original parties or to take

9

an appeal from which neither — from a decision which

10

neither of the original parties chose to appeal.

11

is what has happened in this case.

12
13

That

All of the parties appealed as the case moved
through the Illinois courts, but when it reached the

14 Illinois Supreme Court, the decision there was appealed
15

by neither the state nor by Caterpillar, but it was

16 appealed by Chicago Bridge and Iron.
17

QUESTION*

Well, Caterpillar didn't appeal

18 from the intermediate court of appeals to the Supreme
19 Court of Illinois, did it?
20

MB. SUTTER*

I believe that they did not. Your

21

Honor.

They appealed to the appellate court, and the

22

state appealed all the way, but on issues totally

23 unrelated to the issue that is before this Court today.
24

The issue that is before this Court today is

25 whether the foreign commerce clause precludes the use of

1

worldwide combination by a state in any and all

2

instances.

3

grapple with the difficult problem of what constitutes a

4

unitary business.

5

Caterpillar companies that are involved in this case did

6

constitute a unitary business.

This is not a case where the Court needs to

It is conceded by everybody that the

7

The question, however, is whether the State of

8

Illinois or any other state can impose or permit the use

9

of a method, worldwide combined reporting, if that

10

method is in conflict with and opposed to the method

11

which is internationally accepted by the United States

12

and all of its trading partners.

13

QUESTION:

Is the precise question before us

14

whether the Illinois Tax Commission can impose on

15

Caterpillar the type of reporting and the type of income

16

tax that it did?

17

MR. SUTTER:

No, the precise question is

18

whether the Department of Revenue can impose combined

19

reporting on any taxpayer.

20

Illinois Supreme Court.

21

intervened and became a party plaintiff, it was

22

asserting on its own behalf that worldwide combined

23

reporting could not be applied to it.

24

the Supreme Court was that where you have a unitary

25

business, worldwide combined reporting must be applied

That was the decision of the

QUESTIONS

But --

3

MR. SUTTER:

And it is from that that Chicago

Bridge and Iron is appealing.

question then that is before us, not its application on

MR. SUTTER:

correct, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

Do you suggest there is not a case

or controversy in the constitutional sense?

12

MR. SUTTER:

13

QUESTION:

No, I do not, Your Honor.
I would suppose that the state

14

isn't making any bones about it.

Just as though instead of

intervening they brought a separate suit against the

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

state to enjoin them from applying what seems to be the

2

Illinois law.

3

MR. SUTTER:

4

QUESTION:

5

Precisely, Your Honor.
Is that in the nature of a

declaratory judgment then?

6

MR. SUTTER:

No, that was argued to the

7

Illinois Supreme Court, because the Illinois Supreme

8

Court does not render declaratory judgments in tax

9

matters, and the Illinois Supreme Court held that this

10

was not a declaratory judgment, that our intervention

11

procedure permits an intervenor to raise a question of

12

law which is common to it and to the case in chief.

13

QUESTION:

But hasn't an assessment been —

14

HR. SUTTER:

Indeed, an assessment has been

15

made against Chicago Bridge and Iron.

progress of this case through the courts.

anything into the record.
QUESTION:

22

Hell, isn't this a strange case

23

where you are arguing a case where you don't have a

24

record?

25

MR. SUTTER:

It is perhaps an unusual

procedure, the Illinois intervention procedure. Your

2

Honor.

3

QUESTIONi

4

HR. SUTTER*

It is unusual.
But we are fully a party.

If the

5

Court were to dismiss this case, the question of the

6

constitutionality of combined reporting as applied to

7

Chicago Bridge and Iron would be res judicata.

8

not raise it in Illinois in a later proceeding against

9

us.

Of course, some other taxpayer in some other case

10

might ultimately persuade this Court that it was

11

unconstitutional and we would benefit from that.

12

QUESTIONS

13

HR. SUTTERs

14

17

But you created that problem.
No, Your Honor, we did not create

the problem.
QUESTIONS

15
16

We could

You didn’t have to intervene, did

you?
HR. SUTTERs

No, we did not have to intervene,

18

but we were concerned that this case would wend its way

19

through the Illinois courts dealing with peripheral

20

issues, and everybody assuming the constitutionality of

21

combined reporting, and in addition to which there was a

22 statutory construction argument, which of course does
23

not concern this Court.

If those issues reached the

24

Supreme Court without being controverted, the decision

25

would have said, the way to compute the tax for

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Caterpillar under combined reporting is such and such.

2

It would have not precluded us from raising these issues

3

at a later time, but it would have made the job much

4

more difficult.

5

Since we have a statute which permits us to

6

become a party, which permits us to participate fully in

7

the appeal procedure, in the argument procedure, in the

8

briefing procedure, as an original party, and to oppose

9

both of the original parties as we are in fact opposing

10

both of the original parties on this issue, it seemed to

11

us that that was the appropriate and efficient method of

12

proceeding.

13

assessment against us.

14

asserted, as you might expect that it would, since if

15

this case were dismissed it would win, that there is no

16

case or controversy.

We do have the problem, we do have an

The state has recognized that there is one,

that Caterpillar will receive a very large refund based

19

entirely on the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court

QUESTION*

And you will have lost your claim

22 of unconstitutionality.
23

MR. SUTTER*

And we will have lost our claim

of unconstitutionality.

Mr. Sutter, do you contend that it

is unconstitutional for the state to tax on a worldwide

2

combined reporting basis a taxpayer who requests its use?
MB. SUTTERs

3

No.

The statute in Illinois

4

permits a taxpayer to apply for relief from any tax that

5

the Illinois tax authorities develop, and I suppose that

they could work up a method that as applied to them they

They would settle the case on an ad

It is the imposition of the tax which I

10

submit is unconstitutional because it contravenes all

11

principles of international law.

12

QUESTION:

Well, if there was a settlement

13

between the state and — if the taxpayer just came in

14

and chose to report on this basis and the state accepted

15

it, the impact on foreign commerce would be the same.

No, I think not. Your Honor,

because nobody would be objecting then.

19

because they have concluded that they will come out

better in a particular fashion, I submit that it is not

13

felt that that tax was excessive, very much as ASARCO

14

and Woolworth did, and sought to have the foreign

That was sought under the relief provision of the

Illinois Act.

gone off in the other direction, and I submit that in

22 cases where worldwide combined reporting would be
23

unconstitutional, as it would, because it contravenes

24

the law of nations and therefore contravenes this

25

Court's decision in Japan Line, it might very well be

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

that some form of taxation of dividends along the lines

2

suggested by ASARCO and Woolworth, with the proper

3

recognition of foreign factors, would be the solution

4

for the states, but that is not for me to determine.

5

That is a possibility.

6

Simply put, worldwide combined reporting is

7

followed by no responsible nation in the world today of

9

authorities and by the United States government, and the

10

United States government will tell you today that for us

11

to permit a state to interfere with the system that has

been worked out through the treaties that the United

13

States has with all foreign nations — most foreign —

14

major foreign nations, with the system that the United

15

Nations group of experts recommended for treaties with

16

undeveloped nations as well, the arm's length method

17

would be to throw a spanner into the works of American

18

diplomacy in the area of international trade, and that

that subsidiary taxable by that country must be

HR. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Our analysis here likewise proceeds on the

2

foundation of this Court’s seminal decision three years

3

ago in Japan Line versus County of Los Angeles.

4

the Court struck down a California ad valorem tax on

shipping containers owned by a Japanese company.

Court disagreed, observing that when construing

13

This more extensive constitutional inquiry

brings two additional considerations into play;

as the Court said, the enhanced risk of multiple

uniformity in the conduct of international relations and

state's adoption of a method which is undisputedly at

MR. SMITH;

Well, the treaties do not use the

2

term "arm's length", but I would suggest to the Court

3

that the treaty in Japan line did not — the customs

convention that the Court relied upon did not

specifically outlaw the taxation by the County of Los

nevertheless found that the local tax in question

the United States government necessarily has to take

into account that a particular state method of taxation

which is undisputably at loggerheads and quite different

and based on completely different theoretical

assumptions than the international norm necessarily

introduces an irritant to the conduct of our foreign

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

of problems of federal uniformity, because what would

2

happen would be at the foreign end of the spectrum,

3

somebody else's ox would necessarily be gored.

4

The problem as we see it is that the arm's

5

length method is the international norm and custom of

6

nations, and that the worldwide unitary method, which

7

doesn' take into account separate entities, which is

8

based upon an aggregation of everyone's income into a

9

common pot, and the application of factors, necessarily

10

is at complete variance with this arm's length method,

11

and if the custom of nations which the United States

12

government is obliged to represent ourselves beyond the

13

water's edge is to mean anything, it means essentially

14

that it is only -- it is the United States government

15

that conducts foreign relations and not the states.

16

The Court made that clear, it seems to us, in

17

Japan Lines, and it seems to us that this case

necessarily proceeds on that basis.

interest here is really fickle in the sense that it

2

wanted to apply this method for all years except 1969.

3 The party in interest is simply interested in minimizing
4 its tax liability, and would take any opportunity to do
5 it.
6

Our concern here on behalf of the United States is

that the adoption of this method as a rule of law

7 imposed across the board creates — impairs uniformity
8

in the conduct of foreign relations.

9

Now, before this digression, I was addressing

10

the question of the foreign parent.

I simply want to

11

say that the United States views the foreign parent with

12

particular and special concern because of the

13 record-keeping examples, and while we talk about in our
14 brief cases that might arise, let me simply close by
15 saying that such cases are not a figment of our
16 imagination, but in fact have arised.

There are two

17 cases now pending in the district court in California
18 involving foreign parents in which the California
19 Franchise Tax Board is trying to impose a worldwide
20 unitary method, and create income where local losses

exist.

Exactly.

MR. HARNACK*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, Justice Marshal, as counsel for that

16

fickle taxpayer, Caterpillar, I wish to assure you that

17

we are very interested in the outcome of this case.

QUESTION;

But you didn't appeal.

19

MR. HARNACK;

He did not appeeal. Your Honor,

because we are convinced that the Supreme Court of

Illinois came to the right result in affirming the

2

problems.

MR. HARNACK:

If you didn’t, I have

Both the Solicitor General and

4

counsel for the Appellant have referred to, although I

5

don’t see it cited anywhere in their brief, the law and

6

custom of nations.

It seems about as amorphous as the

7 definition of what constitutes a unitary enterprise on a
8

worldwide basis.

9

yet in this case when you see a unitary operation such

There is no specific definition, and

10

as Caterpillar, the world’s largest earth-moving

11

equipment company, you can be sure that you have the

12

unitary operation.

13
14

Both the Solicitor General and counsel for
Appellant tell us that the application of combination to

15 Caterpillar in this case and in Chicago Bridge and Iron
16 will result and create tensions in the international —
t

17 and disrupt our foreign relations, and I think we should
18 look at the facts in this case and ponder how the
19 application of combination in accordance with the
20

Illinois court will create those tensions.

21

22 first.

Why tensions?

Well, let’s look at Caterpillar

Caterpillar has 25 subsidiary corporations

23 operating throughout the world, but with a nerve center,
24 with a headquarters in Peoria, and if you have had the
25 opportunity to look at a very lengthy record, you have

1

seen where Caterpillar has demonstrated that it is

2

basically one operation.

3

operations, but they could be equally 25 divisions

4

throughout the world, and those 25 divisions would

5

constitute permanent establishments throughout the

6

world, and the treaties that have been alluded to would

7

apply to those permanent establishments, and the foreign

8

countries which would tax those permanent establishments

9

would determine the amount of the income taxable in the

10

11

Yes, it has 25 subsidiary

foreign countries on a separate reporting basis.
And, yes, of course, Illinois could apportion

12

on a formulary basis the worldwide income of one

13

corporation with 25 divisions precisely as it now

14

chooses to apportion the worldwide income of a parent

15

corporation with 25 corporations, and yet, over the past

16

years, with our multitude of multinational corporations,

17

having many divisions, we have not heard the government,

18 the Solicitor General, raise the question as to why the
19

imposition of formulary apportionment to a

20

multinational, single corporate multidivision

21

corporation imposes upon or violates the law and custom

22

of nations, and yet no one would deny that our treaties

23

cover both divisional operations and subsidiary

24 operations.
25

As a matter of fact, the treaties

specifically state that they will both be handled in

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

precisely the same manner.
Now, who cares whether or not Illinois

3

apportions income in Illinois based upon the worldwide

4

income of Caterpillar?

5

the U.K. government have some concern about that?

6

have had the opportunity to look at the diplomatic

7

correspondence which was furnished to the Court, and as

8

we have pointed out in our brief, that correspondence

9

flows only in one direction.

Does Caterpillar U.K. or does
You

Yes, there are tensions.

10

We don't deny there are tensions.

11

whether or not Illinois or other states such as

12

California can or may impose worldwide combination on a

13

foreign controlled group.

14

But the tensions are

The U.K. raises it, Sony raises it, the amicus

15

briefs raise it.

But do we have the same tensions in

16

the case of combination being imposed on the domestic

17

controlled group, and insofar as I have been able to

18

ascertain in my study of all the diplomatic

19

correspondence, the question was not raised, not even

20 inferentially raised, and as a matter of fact in the
21

testimony that was submitted to this Court in the

22 appendix, as I recall —
23
24
25

QUESTION*

Well, is there any suggestion that

the states will treat the two groups differently?
MR. HARNACK*

None, Justice White.

In fact, California has asserted

15

tension.

In fact, domestic combination does not create

16

tension.

In fact, combination of foreign control groups

17

probably does create tension.

18

have all read the diplomatic correspondence.

19

if this Court were to determine that issue as being

20

violative of a commerce clause provision, it would not,

21

as inferred or argued by Appellant, result, if you will,

22

in a Fourteenth Amendment violation to taxpayers in this

23

country.

24
25

Now, throughout the briefs and

It creates

I can't deny that.

However,

This Court decided in the Matson Line that a

commerce clause cannot be held to violate the equal

2

protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

3

that says is, if there is in fact a commerce clause

4

problem, and I don’t for a moment concede that there is

5

a commerce clause problem as it applies to foreign

6

controlled groups, this Court would be in a position to

7

find that problem and resolve that problem, but I would

certainly argue strenuously that insofar as Caterpillar

9

is concerned, the domestic corporate groups are

concerned, we don't have a commerce clause problem.

How do we

The reason that we were able to establish to

the State of Illinois that combination was the proper

method to determine the amount of income properly

apportionable to Illinois was not because we assumed

that a dollar of sales in China had the same value as a

determine that there was no way to determine the

that this just is an omnipresence in the sky, this

is so impossible?

16

White, that the efficacy of combination, the formulary

apportionment is based upon the fact that it is

18

literally impossible to separately source.

19

has never stopped anybody from separately sourcing, but

20

for accurate apportionment of income, you cannot

21

separately source.

22

separately source, then formulary apportionment should

23

be applied to the foreign controlled parent, too.

Now, that

you can't separately source, of course combination is

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. WHITENACK, ESQ.,

14

ON BEHALF" OF ILLINOIS

15

MR. WHITENACK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

16

please the Court, the issue before you today is really

17

whether some corporations should enjoy profound tax

18

advantages over other corporations.

19

advantages, we are told, can be obtained in two ways,

20

first, by separately incorporating the branch offices,

21

even though the home office will continue to enjoy the

22

same control that they enjoyed before incorporating that

23

branch office into a separate subsidiary corporation,

24

and second, by inventing a water's edge cutoff.

25

These tax

Both of these techniques would allow the

2

turn back, time back to when unitary apportionment and

3

multinational operations were exceptions instead of

commonplace.

separate geographical accounting, in spite of all your

6

decisions that separate geographical accounting is not

7

constitutionally required.

him to agree that mere incorporation cannot change the

underlying economic realities.

management, economies of scale remains the same whether

14

you have a branch office or a separately incorporated

While the Solicitor General agrees that

17

18

States, both he and Chicago Bridge and Iron would cut

off that permission at the water's edge, and reverse

22 day there may be a corporation that is operating in the
23

United States at a loss or at a lower profit margin, and

24

so then they say that any state which taxes or uses the

25

combine unitary apportionmen method could be taxing the

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

profits of the controlled foreign subsidiary of that

2

domestic parent.

3

This is circular reasoning.

It uses separate

4

accounting to conclude that the domestic parent is

5

losing money in the United States, and that the foreign

6

controlled subsidiary is making money overseas.

7

already begun with the premise of separating inseparable

8

unitary income, they then come full circle and say that

9

this is proof that separate geographical accounting is

10

necessary to keep this unofficially separated, unitary

11

income free from tax.

12

Having

The premise assumes the answer.

The hypothetical example is also a clear

13

parallel of the facts in Butler Brothers.

On a separate

14

accounting basis, in Butler Brothers, they demonstrated

15

that they were losing money in California, and that the

16

claim to any tax in California would be actually taxing

17

their income earned outside of California.

18

rejected that argument in Butler Brothers, and decided

19

that separate geogprahical accounting cannot be misused

20

to prove a lost inside one state, California, and prove

21

that untaxable income, unitary income was being earned

This Court

22 outside of California, yet if Butler Brothers had had an
23

office in California, and another office in London, the

24

opponents of unitary apportionment today would have this

25

Court reverse Butler Brothers.

38

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Instead of unitary losses being offset against

2

unitary profits, as they must be when you have a single

3

business unit, the separate accounting proposed by

4

Chicago Bridge and Iron and the Solicitor General at the

5 water's edge does not permit such an offset, since it
6

assumes, contrary to your decision in Mobil, that all

7

business income has a clear identifiable source in

8

either London or in California even though it arises

9 from the business as a whole.
10

When we leave the hypothetical example and go

11

to the actual facts of this appeal, your decision in

12

Butler Brothers, in Mobil, have even more impact.

As

13 you know, Illinois is a state that has two conflicting
14 groups.

It is a home state of two conflicting groups of

15 multinational corporations.

One group wants combined

16 unitary apportionment, and the other group wants
17 separate accounting.
18

There is no way that Illinois can allow both

19 unitary apportionment up to the water's edge and then
20

separate accounting everywhere else.

This would

21

discriminate against the domestic corporation.

It would

22 effectively reverse the Uniform Act upon which the

23 Illinois Act is based.

It would cause tax losses to

24 Illinois of tens of millions of dollars.

We've got $40

25 million at stake right now, and it would arbitrarily

3

reality of combination, of combined single unit

4

corporations.

5

That would deny the economic

The water’s edge travesty would also cut the

6

business into four different ways.

There would be

7

separate accounting between the unitary domestic

8

corporation, separate accounting between the unitary

9

foreign corporation.

There would also be separate

10

accounting between the Peoria, Illinois, headquarters

11

and its branch offices, not its subsidiaries, its branch

12

offices overseas.

13

Caterpillar Tractor Company, Caterpillar

14

Finance Company, Caterpillar Credit Corporation,

15

Caterpillar Americas Corporation are not only unitary

16

with their foreign subsidiaries, but each one of the

offices in several foreign nations as well.

Thus, the

of some form of crippled combined unitary apportionment

22 only up to the water’s edge would require outright

generation of tax cases in its wake.

25

could conceivably arise, but if it does happen, then we

have a relief clause adopted from Section 18 of the

For this reason, Chicago Bridge and Iron and

its amici have retreated to the untenable position that

3

our U.S. treaties somehow create a national policy which

4

requires states to disregard Mobil, to disregard Exxon,

to disregard Butler Brother and Bass, Rafclitt.

corporation doing business in Illinois.

treaties is anything but precise.

difficulty in defining arm’s length pricing system and

HR. WHITENACK*

We wish, Your Honor, that this

2

Court will affirm in its entirety the decision of the

3

Illinois Supreme Court that combined unitary method is

4

an appropriate method for a state to use worldwide.

5

I think that there are two points that I need

6 to make before the time goes out.
7

This very question

has been raised in Congress for decades, of whether or

8 not states ought to be limited and prevented from using
9

the combined unitary method.

10

11

limit the states.

Congress has not been

Congress has debated it and decided not to
In the celebrated United Kingdom-U.S.

12 Treaties Debate before the United States Senate, the
13 Senate decided not to limit the states, and here we have
14

the United States Treasury Department acting through the

15 Solicitor General asking this Court to set the very
16 policy that the United States Senate declined to set.
17 The appropriate forum for those who oppose the combined
18 unitary method is in Congress and not before the Court.
19

Finally, there is one fact that seems to get

20 lost in this appeal, and that fact is that no state,
21

least of all Illinois, compels any corporation to enter

22 into a unitary relationship with any other corporation.
23 The way corporations manage their business is soley
24 their choice, not our choice.

If they don't feel — if

25 they feel that combined unitary apportionment is worth

2

autonomous, and by doing that, the combined unitary

3

method no longer applies, but they cannot come to this

4

Court and ask this Court to separate the income that

5

they decided to make inseparable.
I think I will make that point again, that

6
7

they can't separate — they can't ask this Court to make

8

that income separated, when they themselves have made

9

that income inseparable by making it a business as a

whole.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM P. SUTTER, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT - REBUTTAL

,16

MR. SUTTER*

I have two brief points. Your

17

Honor.

Fif'st, it should be clearly understood that we

18

do not advocate the reversal or overruling of Bass,

19

Ratcliff.

This is not a case where a branch is

20

involved.

There are substantial differences in this

21

than admitting that the Court said in Mobil that where a

22

branch and the subsidiary concerned is frequently the

23

2

'

In the treaty sense, and we must bear in mind

3

that our entire case here is based on the law of

4

nations, which does not recognize combined reporting for

5

subsidiaries, the treaties upon which we rely to

6

demonstrate what the United States has chosen as its

7

modus operandi vis-a-vis its foreign trading partners

8

recognize that there can be double taxation of

9

branches.

The branch abroad must be treated there on an

10

arm's length basis, but the treaties recognize that the

11

United States as the domiciliary nation can tax all of

12

the income, including the branch income.

13

They preclude that where it isn’t a branch

14

that is abroad, but a subsidiary that is abroad.

15

rule can be different.

16

18

foreign subsidiaries of American companies or to

Secondly, on the question of the Congressional

21

intent, this Court has already recognized in the Japan

22

Line case and more recently in another case which at

23

this moment I cannot recall that it is not necessary

24

where the national interest is involved for there to be

25

Congressional action to find that the commerce clause

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

has been violated

interest, regardless of whether Congress has acted.

The commerce clause can be violated

On the British Treaty, the facts are that in

5

point of fact the reservation, the provision which would

6

have precluded some limited amount of worldwide

7

combination did carry by a majority vote of the Senate.

8

It did not carry by the necessary two-thirds vote.

9

is the only vote of any kind on this matter of which I

10

am aware.

11

and that went out.

12

That

After that was done, the Treaty was amended,
The Treaty was then passed.

The British were so distressed by that fact

13

that before they would reapprove the Treaty, they

14

demanded a protocol which permitted expanded taxation of

15

American oil companies doing business in the North Sea,

16

and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Lubeck

17

at the time, wrote to one of the Senators stating that

18

the United States acquiesced in that expansion of

19

British taxing power because they recognized that they

20

would demand a concession in return for having given up

21

the protection that prohibition against worldwide

22

combination would have given them.

24

than that in Japan Line.

6

property.

Here, we are dealing with

Income is clearly a form of intangible
The state says it is not taxing foreign

7 income, it is only determining the proper income in
8

Illinois.

9

That is a conceptual argument.
But when the foreign country determines income

10 on a totally different basis, a basis which is
11

incommensurate, theoretically incompatible with combined

12 reporting, as is arm's length reporting, then it is
13 precisely the same situation.
14

That property, that

income is taxed by the foreign country in accordance

15 with the law of nations, as was the property by Japan in
16 Japan Line.
17

If, then, a different theory finds that some

18 of that property is really U.S.

property, and really

19 subject to tax here, really subject to income tax here,
20 there is the same duplication of tax that there was in
21

the Japan Line case.

The two systems, as this Court

22 said in Mobil, allocation and apportionment, are
23 incommensurate, and if apportionment is constitutionally
24 preferred it must be sustained, and if the other, the
25 other.
