ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SMITH:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

8 it please the Court:
9

This federal income tax case is here on write of

10 certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.

It

11 involves a definition of controlled group of corporations
12 and component members.

A technical area of the tax law that

13 we believe appropriately lends itself to elucidation by
14 means of the Commissioner's Treasury Regulations.
15

And at the outset I would like to point out to the

16 Court that there is a regulation that specifically addresses
17 the facts of this case, with an explicit example that
18 governs this case.
19

As we shall point out later in our argument, the

20 Court of Claims admitted in its opinion that the
21 Commissioner's regulation was not unreasonable.

But it went

22 on to hold that the regulation was invalid because it
23 believed that its interpretation of the statute served
24 better purposes and was more reasonable.
25

At the outset, I think it bears repeating that
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 under an unbroken line of decisions of this Court, the
2 question in this case is not whether the Court of Claims has
3 reached a more reasonable interpretation of the statute, but
4 rather, the question is whether the Commissioner's
5 regulation is a reasonable interpretation of the statute.
6 We think it is, and with this admonition in mind, I think we
7 can turn to the particular statute at hand.
8
9 Code of

It is Section 1563(a)(2) of the Internal Revenue
1954, pertinent parts of which are set out at the

10 bottom of page 6 of our brief.
11

At the outset, I think it's important to point out

12 to the Court what the purpose of this statute was, which I
13 think is beyond dispute.

The corporate income tax is made

14 up of two levels, a basic rate and a surtax.

For example, a

15 30% normal rate and a 25% surtax, and the rates keep
16 changing, but normally, it’s on the first $25,000 there is
17 the normal rate, and then the combined normal rate and
18 surtax on the remainder of taxable income.
19

Because of this split in brackets, it has been

20 attempted by various business organizations to split income
21 among many different corporations which are essentially part
22 of the same economic enterprise, to reduce the overall tax
23 burden of a business.

And because of that, the Commissioner

24 has, in the past, had a number of statutory weapons at his
25 disposal; for example, Section 269 and 1551 of the Code,
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 which required a judicial inquiry as to whether these
2 corporations were formed or split up for the purpose of
3 reducing taxes or getting an additional surtax exemption.
4
5

Because of the difficulty of probing and deriving
these factual — entry of these factual increase. Congress

6 finally adopted this statute in

1964 and amended it in 1969

7 to establish a precise mathematical test.

And if you are a

8 controlled group of corporations, then the component members
9 of the group must either share the corporate surtax
10 exemption or pay a 6% penalty, if they're going to each
11 claim a separate surtax exemption.
12

Now, the particular controlled group involved in

13

this case is the so-called brother-sister group, and it is

14

defined, as we point out here for pertinent parts of the

15

statute, in two different subparagraphs of Section

16

1563(a)(2).

17

that is a brother-sister group -- if five or fewer persons

18

who are individuals own stock possessing (A) at least 80% of

19

the stock of each corporation, and (B) more than 50% of the

The provision says two or more corporations --

20 stock of each corporation, taking into account the stock
21 ownership of each such person, only to the extent such stock
22 ownership is identical with respect to each such corporation.
23

Basically, --

24

QUESTION:

25

Nr. Smith, what do you think the

reasoning behind the Court in the case of United States v.
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Cartwright was, where it struck down a Treasury regulation.
2

MR. SKITHs

I think the reasoning behind the Court

3 in United States v. Cartwright was that the regulation was
4 unreasonable and inconsistent with the statute.

We think

5 the regulation at issue here fully implements the plain
6 language of the statute and is consistent with the
7 congressional purpose of eliminating multiple surtax
8 exemptions for corporations controlled as a single economic
9 entity.
10

QUESTIONi

Maybe your reading of the statute --

11 the Court, of Claims' reading of the statute -- would make
12 more sense than Congress made, but how do you get away from
13 the 80%?
14

MR. SMITHS

Well, I think -- let me turn to the

15 facts of the case and I think our position will become clear.
16

In this particular case, we have two shareholders;

17 Arthur Vogel and Richard Crain, and two corporations, Vogel
18 Fertilizer and Vogel Popcorn.
19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SMITH:

21 Fertilizer.

Does Vogel own 80% in each?
Arthur Vogel owns 77.49% of Vogel

Richard Craine owns the remaining 22.51% of

22 Vogel Fertilizer.

For Vogel Popcorn, Arthur Vogel owns

23 87.5% of the stock of Vogel Popcorn.
24

Now, just looking at the plain words --

25

QUESTION:

If you add those two together and
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 divide by two, then you do have 80 -- is that the way it's
2 supposed to work?
3

MR. SMITH;

Yes, exactly.

We think the 80% test

4 of the statute, which is the only part of this statute
5 that's at issue here, everyone agrees that the 50% part of
6 the statute is met, but -7

QUESTION;

But you didn't mention that Crain owns

8 nothing of Popcorn.
9

MR. SMITH;

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. SMITH;

No, Crain owns nothing of popcorn.
You think that's wholly irrelevant?
Well, that's the issue here, as to

12 whether Crain has to own any shares in Popcorn.
13

QUESTION;

Your position is that it's wholly

14 irrelevant.
15

MR. SMITH;

It's our position here that that is

16 irrelevant on the face of the statute.

And just reading the

17 statute, the question is whether five or fewer persons -18 and here we have Arthur Vogel and Richard Crain -- own
19 stock, -- who are individuals, which they are -- own stock
20 possessing at least 80% of the stock of each corporation.
21

Now, Arthur Vogel and Richard Crain own 100% of

22 Vogel Fertilizer, and Arthur Vogel, who is also a person in
23 that group, owns 87.5% of Vogel Popcorn.

In our view, the

24 plain language of the statute, the literal language of the
25 statute, supports the result that Subparagraph (a) applies

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Smith,

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STUART A. SMITH, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - Resumed

7

MR. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8 the Court, when the recess occurred, we were discussing the
9 text of Section 1563(a)(2),

which is set forth in pertinent

10 part at the bottom of page 6 of our brief.

The statute

11 defines a brother-sister group, which consists of, quote,
12 "two or more corporations,

if five or fewer persons who are

13 individuals own stock possessing
14 stock of each corporation, and

(A) at least

80% of the

(B) more than 50% of the

15 stock of each corporation taking into account the stock
16 ownership of each such person, only to the extent such stock
17 ownership is identical with respect to each such
18 corporation."
19
20 test.

The statute has two parts, an

80% test and a 50%

Perhaps the best way to attack the statute on the

21 facts of this case is to first put out of the way the 50%
22 test, the applicability of which is undisputed here.
23
24 if I may.

QUESTION;

Let me ask you one question, Mr. Smith,

With the 80% rule in the statute itself, doesn't

25 -- isn't that made almost superfluous by the regulation?

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. SMITH;

No, because the 80% rule, or part of

2 the statute, is still important in order to insure that the
3 corporations be closely held.
4 statute in

The 50% test was added to the

1969 at a time when the number of shareholders

5 went from one to five in order to retain commonality of
6 ownership or overlap.

And I think the best way to

7 illustrate that is on the facts of this case.
8

Here we have two shareholders, Arthur Vogel and

9 Richard Crain, and two corporations, Vogel Fertilizer and
10 Vogel Popcorn.

Now, Arthur Vogel owns 77.49% of Fertilizer,

11 and Richard Crain owns the remaining 22.51%.

Arthur Vogel

12 owns 87.5% of Popcorn, and the remaining shares of Popcorn
13 are owned by a trust.

Crain doesn't own any shares in

14 Popcorn.
15

QUESTION;

So Crain is, in effect, drawn into the

16 net by his interest in Vogel.
17

MR. SMITH;

Crain is drawn into the net by his

18 interest -- well, when you say Vogel, his interest in
19 Fertilizer.

The statute applies because of Crain's interest

20 in Fertilizer.

And I think that the words of the statute

21 support our submission that the statute applies.
22

Let me first put out of the way the application of

23 the 50% test in subparagraph (B).

The italicized words

24 which we have italicized at the bottom of page 6 of our
25 brief, the taking into account the stock ownership, works as
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 follows.
2

You find out -- you take into account the stock

3 ownership of each such person as to the extent it is
4 identical.

In this particular case, the identical stock

5 ownership is 77.49%.

Arthur Vogel owns that amount in Vogel

6 Fertilizer, and indeed, he owns 87% of Vogel Popcorn.

So

7 using 77%, to round the figures, as the identical stock
8 ownership, subparagraph

(B) of the statute which demands

9 that five or fewer persons own more than 50% of the stock of
10 each corporation is met.

Because indeed, Arthur Vogel is

11 one person; one is less than five, and the required overlap
12 is met.
13

QUESTION;

14

MB. SMITH;

15

QUESTIONS

16

MR. SMITH;

17 tandem.

A and B are conjunctive, are they not?
What is conjunctive, Mr. Chief Justice?
A and B of this -A and B of the statute have to work in

But our submission is that the Court of Claims has

18 confused the application of A and B by requiring some
19 overlap in A,

when the words of the statute, if I may

20 suggest, simply don't speak to any overlap.
21

QUESTION;

But they do have to subsist together.

22 I mean
23

MR. SMITH;

They do have to subsist together, but

24 in our view they subsist together to the extent that we're
25 talking about the same group of five or fewer persons.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Here, the group is Arthur Vogel and Richard Crain; two
2 persons, ergo, less than five.
3
4 A.

QUESTION:

But you have to have the two to satisfy

And you have two here, you say, to satisfy A.

5

MR. SMITH:

We have two that satisfy A.

6

QUESTION:

But only one that satisfies B.

7

MR. SMITH;

Right, exactly.

8

QUESTION;

And what are the two, to be precise,

9 that satisfy A?
10

MR. SMITH:

The two that satisfy A are Arthur

11 Vogel and Richard Craine, because going back to the words of
12 the statute, if five or fewer persons who are individuals
13 own stock possessing at least 80% of the stock of each
14 corporation .
15

QUESTION;

16

MR. SMITH:

And 77 or whatever it is -Well, actually, for Fertilizer it's

17 100%, because -18

QUESTION:

I know, because as you say, 77 plus 22

19 is 100, so that's more than 80.
20

MR. SMITH:

And for Popcorn, Arthur Vogel

21 satisfies it in its entirety, because he owns 87%.

You

22 don't have to look to anything else.
23

In our view, this is the language of the statute.

24

QUESTION:

But if he only owned 40% of Popcorn,

25 the statute would not be satisfied.
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HE.

2

QUESTION:

SHITHf

That's right
How do you account for the word "and"

3 between A and B in the statute?
4

HR. SMITH:

Well, they simply talk about both

5 tests that have to be met.

Our submission here is that

6 based on the literal language of the statute, the only thing
7 that is required is that five or fewer persons own at least
8 80% of the stock of each corporation.
9

QUESTION:

Why didn't the Court of Claims agree

10 with you?
11

HR.

SMITH:

The Court of Claims did not agree with

12 us because they looked to the phrase "each such person" in
13 subparagraph E, and they somehow felt that each such person
14 really spoke to five or fewer persons, and that somehow,
15 that meant -- and I must confess that it really is as the
16 Second Circuit characterized it in Allen Oil Company, a
17 convoluted reading of the statute.

Eecause what they have

18 done is take a kind of hybridized overlap and attributed
19 that to subparagraph A, when In fact, subparagraph A has no
20 overlap at all.
21

The overlap aspects of the statute are completely

22 carried by subparagraph B.

If there is 50% overlap, that

23 satisfies the overlap aspects of the statute.
24

QUESTION:

Of course, it's not hard for an

25 ordinary person to convolute the Internal Revenue Code.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. SMITH;

Indeed.

Both ordinary and

2 extraordinary people engage in that on a daily basis.
3

QUESTION;

When we're construing a statute of this

4 kind we — must the courts construe it most strictly against
5 the taxpayer or most strictly against -6

MR. SMITH;

I’m not sure that there are any such

7 doctrines of strict construction against one party or the
8 other.

let me simply say, Mr. Chief Justice, that in our

9 view, the plain language of the statute supports the
10 Commissioner's interpretation.
11

QUESTION;

Even if it was ambiguous, there is some

12 rule that you pay some deference to the Commissioner's -13

MR. SMITH;

Oh, indeed, here.

14 don't even think it's ambiguous.

And indeed, we

But to the extent that one

15 could convolute, we think that here we have a Treasury
16 regulation -17

QUESTION;

18 convolute.
19

I don't know what you mean by

What do you mean by convolute?
MR. SMITH;

To the extent that if one could mis --

20 you know, engage in another interpretation.

We think here,

21 as Mr. Justice White has pointed out, there are Treasury
22 regulations that elucidate the statute, provide for an
23 example that speaks to the very question in this case, which
24 we think -25

QUESTION;

And how old is that regulation?
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. SMITH*

That regulation came out in temporary

2 form, Mr. Justice White, in March of 1971, two years before
2 the taxable years at issue.

And indeed, the taxpayer here

4 -- there's no dispute about this -- filed their return on
5 the basis of not claiming separate surtax exemptions,
6 following the regulation.
7

QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, before lunch I think you

8 started your argument by saying that the purpose of the
9 statute was to prevent the split-up of a single economic
10 entity or enterprise.

What is a single economic entity or

11 enterprise in this case?
12

MR. SMITH:

Well, it's really what is defined by

13 the statute in objective mathematical terms.
14

QUESTION:

15

MR. SMITH;

16

QUESTION:

It's that --

What is it in economic terms?
Well, I think -The Popcorn business or the Fertilizer

17 business ?
18

MR. SMITH:

Well, it’s not the lines of business.

19 It's simply the percentage of shareholdings and overlap.
20 It's a particular kind of closely-held group of corporations
21 in which there is the requisite overlap, and we think they
22 are met in this case.

And I think that the best way to

23 illustrate your point is perhaps by pointing that the Court
24 of Claims agreed here, and indeed responded, it concedes,
25 that the statute would be met in this case if Richard Crain
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 owned one share of stock in Vogel Popcorn.
2

Because in their view, you can’t really count

3 Crain's interest for purposes of the 80% test unless he owns
4 some de minimus; indeed, one share, of Vogel Popcorn.

find

5 we think that really turns the legislative purpose on its
6 head.
7

What Congress was -QUESTION;

Isn't a fair way to state the issue as

8 to whether the five or fewer persons referred to in the
9 statute have to be the same persons for both A and B?

NR. SMITH;

That is indeed the way -That's the issue.
That's the issue.

13 that the -14

QUESTION;

find there's only one mention of five or

15 fewer persons that applies to both A and B, isn't there?
16

MR. SMITH;

Well, five or fewer persons -- it

17 seems to me that you have to read

A and B as separate parts

18 of the statute.
19

QUESTION;

But referring to different groups of

20 five or fewer -21

NR. SMITH;

Well no, no.

22 fewer persons is the same group.

I think that the five or
But the question is really

23 whether each member of the five or fewer persons has to own
24 stock in A and B, and we don't think that the words of the
25 statute support that.

We're taking about five or fewer

1 persons who are individuals who own stock, possessing at
2 least 80% of the stock of each corporation, and that’s
3 concededly met here.

QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, what can Crain do to get out

5 from under this?
6

MR. SMITH;

7

QUESTION;

What could Crain -He doesn't own any of the stock,

What did he do wrong?
Crain didn't do anything wrong, Mr.

The only way that the numbers would have

14 to be changed, Crain would have to sell some of his shares.

QUESTION;

What is it that Crain did that Congress

QUESTION;

Well, another way if you don’t want to

25

MR. SMITH;

No, I do want to answer the question,
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 but I don't think it really helps the analysis to talk about
2 as a guilty party.
3

QUESTION:

4

HR. SMITH:

Well, assuming I think it might help it
Well, I think that, you know, on the

5 fats of this case, with Crain owning 22% — if Crain is
6 going to insist on owning 22% of the shares, then he has to
7 acquiesce in Congress’s decision that these two corporations
8 are not going to share -- are not going to be eligible for
9 separate corporate surtax exemptions because these are
10 members of a brother-sister controlled group, as the statute
11 is defined.
12

The shareholdings could be re-arranged perhaps in

13 a way to provide for more than five shareholders.

Crain

14 could presumably -15

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

Well following up on Justice Marshall's

19 thought, supposing originally Crain owned this interest in
20 the company in which Mr. X owned the ether 77%.
21 he'd have the full exemption.

And then

Then Mr. X sells out to Mr.

22 Vogel and Mr. Crain loses a big part of his exemption.
23

MR. SMITH:

That's true, that is true.

But as we

24 point out in our reply brief, you know, because the
25 respondent makes much of the fact that our construction of
18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the statute would visit surprises on fellow shareholders,
2 the tax laws are replete with instances where that could be
3 the case.

You could have a Subchapter S corporation in

4 which you have the maximum number of shareholders,

and then

5 one of the shareholders decides to sell some stock to
6 someone else, which thereby increases the number of
7 shareholders beyond the maximum.

And the corporation then

8 loses its status.
9

I don't think that the fact that that might happen

10 necessarily casts doubt on what we think is really the plain
11 language, our interpretation, which is really supported by
12 the plain language of the statute.

MR. SMITH:

Now,

Right.

I think that it's relevant that the fact that

18 respondent concedes and the Court of Claims concedes that if
19 Richard Crain owned one share of stock in Vogel Popcorn that
20 the result would be different, really, it seems to me,
21 proves the validity of the interpretation that we are urging
22 here.
23

QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, I'd like to talk to you a

24 little bit about, or have you explain to me a little bit
25 about the legislative history.

I guess the section was

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 originally enacted in 1964 as just an 80% test.
2

ME. SMITH:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SMITH:

That’s right, Justice O'Connor.
Without the 50% requirement.
Right, because at that point, the

5 share -- it had to be one shareholder owning 80% or more of
6 each corporation.

That was the requirement.

The overlap

7 and the closely held aspects of the statute were merged in
8 the single 80% test.
9

But when Congress in 1969 determined that it was

10 very easy to avoid application of the statute because you
11 could simply just sell a few shares to another shareholder
12 and then you would have two shareholders.

So they expanded

13 the shareholder group to five.
14

QUESTION:

From one to five.

But didn't change

15 the other language of subsection A, which would indicate
16 that the common ownership was required?
17

MR. SMITH:

Well no, because I think, as we

18 pointed out in our reply brief in the footnote, the common
19 ownership aspect of the statute was taken up by the 50% test
20 of subparagraph B.

And that's the import of the language,

21 taking into account the stock ownership of each such
22 corporation only to the extent that such stock ownership is
23 identical.

And once the 50% common ownership requirement

24 was taken into the statute, in our view the only thing left
25 of the 80% test was the closely held tack that the

Would you concede that originally, as

I would concede that, but I would also

6 suggest to you and the Court that once the statute changed,
7 the statute had to be construed in a different sort of way;
8 that the common -9

QUESTION;

But subsection A aid not change other

10 than to say expand from one to five, right?
11

MR. SMITH;

Yes, indeed, but once adding

12 subsection B, it's clear that the legislative history, the
13 Treasury studies, indicate that the aspect of common
14 ownership that the statute was attacking was going to be
15 covered completely by the 50% test, because if that were not
16 the result, then it would be an 80% common ownership test
17 and everyone agrees that that is not the case here; it's
18 only a 50% common ownership.
19

QUESTIONs

Mr. Smith, at page 6 of your brief in

20 the second full paragraph in the summary of argument you
21 say, "Congress sought to provide an objective mathematical
22 test to eliminate income splitting among corporations,
23 operated as one economic entity."
24

Doesn't that make the Court of Claims' concession

25 that if Smith had owned one share in Popcorn — fit in with
23

1

that?

It's a mathematical test?

2

MR. SMITH;

Indeed, because in our view, if Crain

3 had owned one share of Popcorn,

that really wouldn't have

4 enhanced Vogel's ability to control these corporations as a
5 single economic entity.
6 wasn't intended to

And in our view, the statute really

turn on such minute differences, and it

Oh, that's true, but I don't think --

14 there are lines here.

80% test and, of course, if 79.9, it

15 wouldn't fit the statute.

But I think our point simply is

16 here, if Congress was attacking and trying to define
17 enterprises controlled as a single economic entity, it
18 really forced that purpose to say well, we're going to make
19 the statute apply if Crain owned one share of Popcorn.
20 really doesn't add
21 really what

22

anything to Vogel's ability, and that's

the focus of the statute is on.

Your Honors, it appears that the sharpest division

10 between the government and the taxpayer comes in defining
11 the functions and the interactions of the 80% and the 50%
12 tests, and how these functions advance the design of the
13 statute.
14

Now, if I may just reiterate and summarize for you

15 what I believe the differences are, I think this would help
16 very much.
17

The taxpayer’s interpretation, our interpretation

18 of the statute is as follows.

We apply the 80% test first,

This is where we

25 entire financial interest.
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, why is a financial interest necessary?

It’s

2 necessary because the conduct sanctioned by this particular
3 statute is the exercise of control over more than one
4 corporation by a small group of persons for their own
5 substantial financial interest in the corporations.

With

6 this function, commonality is required.
7

Now, the 50% test, I believe that both the

3 government and myself agree, is one of control.

It

9 identifies the degree of control necessary to allow the
10 corporations to be operated as one economic entity.
11

Now, we believe that our interpretation of the

12 particular statute gives both tests a separate and distinct
13 function.

The government, on the other hand, interprets the

14 statute in such a manner that both of the tests, the 805? and
15 the 50% tests, are tests of control.
16

The 50% test, which they would apply first,

17 determines whether the corporations have a commonality of
18 control through common stockholders.

We don’t really have

19 any argument with that particular definition.

But their 80%

20 test ensures only that the stock is closely held.

The

21 exemption is saved under their interpretation if there are
22 shareholders outside the 50% five or fewer group that own
23 more than 20% of its stock.
24

Now, I would submit that under the government's

25 interpretation, 1563 as a scheme wherein the 80% test has no

MR. JENSEN:

Well, this is the arbitrary line that

9 Congress has picked in their own wisdom, and if 80% is 80%
10 in the test, then 80% meets the rule.

That just follows.

11 But 79% is not 80%.
12

QUESTION:

Well then, I gather, Mr. Jensen, that

13 if he had 80% or 85% in Fertilizer and only 77% in Popcorn,
14 the fact that the other chap had 22% in Popcorn wouldn't

21

Now, if I might present an example, I think that

22 this will bring the unreasonableness of the government's 80%
23 test in view.

Let's suppose that one of you owns 70% of

24 corporation number one, in which I own 30%.
25 around.

Tax time rolls

Of course, the Tax Court, as you probably already
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 well know, says that there is

a surprise visited upon me,

2 and perhaps upon you,

in that the surtax exemption is lost

3 or is at least shared

if you, all of a sudden, I

all of a

4 sudden find out, that

you own not just one other

corporation

5 as the Tax Court says, but four other corporations.

And

6 let's assume that in those four other corporations you own
7 70% of each one, including the one I am in, the fifth one,
8 and there is a different 30% shareholder in each corporation.
9

So we have 70% going across, if I can draw a

10 schematic here, and 30% going down, with each different
11 shareholder.

Now, not only is the corporation in which you

12 and I own stock -- not only does that corporation lose its
13 surtax exemption or at least shares its surtax exemption
14 under the regulation, but also those other corporations lose
15 their surtax exemption.
16

Now which one, which corporate group, which

17 brother-sister controlled group are we in?

What we have is

18 five corporations with six shareholders, and the statute
19 says you can only count five shareholders.

Are we in the

20 brother-sister controlled group comprising corporations one
21 through four, leaving the fifth one out?

Are we in

22 corporations one through three, leaving four and five in a
23 separate group?

Are we not in a brother-sister controlled

24 group at all, but two through five, corporations two through
25 five are in a separate brother-sister controlled group?
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

This type of arbitrary determination I believe

2 illustrates the unreasonableness of the regulation.

Now,

3 the regulation does have, in a separate part, a provision
4 dealing with overlapping interest like this, but it simply
5 provides that the corporations are to get together and
6 somehow allocate among themselves the exemption at the time
7 they file their tax return, or suffer the allocation
8 subsequently made by the Commissioner at tax audit time.
9

But how can the parties make this allocation if,

10 prior to audit, they don't even know who is in the group?
11 And what policy reason is served by treating
12 identically-owned corporations;

that is, 70-30 corporations,

13 in each one in a different manner?
14

Thus, I submit that the regulation's 80? test

15 draws a totally artificial line,

and creates an unreasonable

16 design not intended by Congress, by arbitrarily excluding a
17 corporation with a pattern of ownership that is identical to
18 every other corporation.
19

Again, from a policy standpoint, either all of the

20 corporations owned 70-30 should be in the group or none
21 should be, and we, of course, submit that none should be.
22 There is no indication anywhere that Congress ever intended
23 to lay such a trap for the expanded group of unknowing
24 minority shareholders.
25

Now, if I might turn for a second to the proper

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 test that the government has allocated or said that should
2 be applied to this particular example,

this particular reg.

3 Your Honors, the regulation in question is, without a
4 dispute, without any dispute whatsoever, an example of an
5 interpretive regulation rather than a legislative
6 regulation.

That is, I define a legislative regulation as

7 one written in direct response to a specific delegation of
8 authority by Congress.

That's the difference between this

9 case and the Portland Cement case, for example.
10

This regulation, on the other hand, is written

11 under the general auspices of Section 7805.

Now, I well

12 understand the general reluctance and the general wisdom of
13 this Court to not overturn contemporaneous constructions of
14 a statute by those charged with its administration, and who
15 -- and those people who are presumably well aware of
16 congressional intent.
17

I believe that the test should be in such a case,

18 though, whether that regulation implements the congressional
19 mandate in some reasonable manner.
20

As recognized by the Court of Claims in this case

21 and supported by this Court's recent decision last summer in
22 Rowan Companies, the rule of deference, however, is not
23 appropriate in this case when the Treasury is interpreting a
24 definition specifically set forth in a statute, such as we
25 have here.
33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Because we can't in this case measure the

2 Commissioner's definition word for word against a statutory
3 definition of the term brother-sister controlled group, the
4 proper test that we ultimately get to to determine whether
5 the congressional mandate has been fulfilled is to look to
6 see whether the regulation in question harmonizes with the
7 plain language of the statute, its origin and its purpose.
8 We submit that it fails on all three counts.
9

The regulation, going to the plain language of the

10 statute first, the regulation, of course, clearly adds four
11 very important words to its otherwise word-for-word
12 recitation of what the statute says, and those words are
13 singly or in combination.
14

Thus, I'd submit that on its face, the regulation

15 adds to the statute words that Congress did not write.
16 Without a doubt then, this regulation can hardly be said to
17 harmonize with the statutory defintion as required by the
18 Rowan case.
19

The government, of course, has advanced the theory

20 that its regulation, inspite of this lack of harmony,
21 correctly interprets the statute under some type of a
22 natural reading theory.

While this type of analysis may

23 have initially its appeal, the problem with such a natural
24 reading, as you have alluded tc,

is that it ignores the

25 well-established and commonly-used guidelines of English

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 grammar and usage in interpreting the statute.
2

Of course, Congress could have emphasized that the

3 80% test required common ownership by reiterating the phrase
4 "each such person in the 80% test as well as in the 50%",
5 but it really didn't mean to do that.

First of all, it was

6 not abandoning the principle of common ownership as found in
7 the 1964 statute.

Second of all, it was not ignoring the

8 English language in the structure of the statute.
9

These two factors we believe effectively cause

10 such phrase to be part of the 80% test without the need for
11 Congress to reiterate the phrase in the statute.
12

Now, this particular interpretation, I want to

13 emphasize, does not import the entire identical interest
14 clause into the 80% test.

It merely illustrates the use by

15 statutory analysis of what persons should be in the 80%.
16 And once you have that group determined, these two tests
17 then work separately to fulfill their purposes as Congress
18 intended.
19

20 curiosity, were you or your office counsel for these

MR. SMITH;

19

And, of cour se, that decision was r eversed by the

20 Fou rth Circuit,
21 a nd

22

as was the Tax Court reversed by the Eighth

the Second Circuit , too.
I simply wan t to re-emphasize to th e Court that we

23 thi nk that based on

th e Court of Claims' cone ession here

24 tha t the Commissioner' s regulation was not
25 int erpretation of

an unreasonable

the statute -- and I think I have
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 demonstrated to the Court that the plain language of the
2 statute supports the Commissioner's interpretation -- that
3 we think under the decisions of this Court, that the
4 regulation should be approved as a valid interpretation of
5 the stat ute .
6

QUESTION;

Do you think you ought to win without

7 the regulation?
8

MR. SMITH;

I think we ought to win without the

9 regulation because I think the plain language of the statute
10 supports us, and I think the legislative history supports
11 us.

And I simply want to say in closing that at the time

12 and this really goes to the point that Justice O'Connor and
13 I were exploring -- at the time that Congress amended the
14 statute in 1969 to expand the shareholder group from one to
15 five, it did in our view make the 50% test accomlish the
16 common control purpose of the statute and leave the 80% test
17 simply to represent -- to carry the closely-held character
18 of the corporations.
19

And at the time that Congress was expanding this

20 group from one to five, the House Ways and Means Committee
21 ratified the Treasury's statement that it intended to adopt
22 the same test here that it did in Section 1551, which has a
23 comparable mathematical test, although there is also a
24 factual inquiry that has to be made in that statute as to
25 whether the corporation was formed to receive the transfer.
40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

find at the time, in 1969, there was on the books

2 for at least two years a Treasury regulation under Section
3 1551; precisely, 1551-1G, Example 4, which we cite in our
4 brief, which sets forth an example which demonstrates that
5 under Section 1551, that not every member of the five or
6 fewer persons has to own stock in each corporation for the
7 80% test to apply.
8

And presumably, the same Treasury that was

9 recommending the expansion of the test knew what the
10 regulation said, and basically so did the tax-writing
11 committees of Congress.

And it seems to us with this

12 legislative history and with the peculiar result that would
13 be reached under the respondent's interpretation where a
14 single share of stock would cause a different result, based
15 on the plain language we think the Court of Claims was wrong.
16

QUESTION;

Mr. Smith, wouldn't you agree that at

17 the time that the Treasury Department was talking to the
18 Congress, when this act was passed, that their explanation
19 was far from clear and didn't set forth the position that
20 was subsequently adopted in the Treasury regulation?
21

MR. SMITH;

I think I would agree that I would

22 prefer -- my case would be stronger — if the Treasury
23 studies adopted -- had the same language as the regulation.
24 But the regulation came not far down the road as a
25 contemporaneous construction of the statute, and given the
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 history. Justice O'Connor, of the similarity that Congress
2 was attempting to use in this statute as in Section 1551, I
3 think it’s fair to conclude that what Congress intended to
4 do was to adopt the same test that existed in the 1551
5 reg ulation.
6

QUESTION:

Well, I do have concerns about that.

7 It looks somewhat as though the Treasury Department had
3 second thoughts after the Act was passed and then adopted
9 the regulation, and that it didn't have the same thoughts
10 when it was talking to the Congress.
11

HR. SMITH:

I don't think that it's fair to

12 conclude that on this record.

There is really nothing to

13 indicate that the regulation was an afterthought.

Many

14 regulations, as common practice, follow the enactment of the
15 statute by some time after studies and, you know, they're
16 proposed and then circulated for comment and then come out
17 in final form.
18

I will say that on pages 27 and 28 we set forth a

19 portion of the Treasury proposals, and they talk about, to a
20 large extent, a group of corporations in which five or fewer
21 persons own, to a large extent, in identical portions at
22 least 80% of the stock of each of the corporations.

And it

23 goes on then to describe the 50% test in terms of the stock
24 of a particular person.
25

So I think one could derive, as indeed some of the
42
