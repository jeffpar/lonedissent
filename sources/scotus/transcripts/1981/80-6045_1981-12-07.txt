ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. BARRETT, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

MR. BARRETT;

9

Mr.

10 Petitioner

Thank you.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,

is here today because the court of appeals for

11 the Second Circuit held that his employment discrimination
12 claim under
13 be dismissed
14 of

to

The only reason for the

the federal Title 7 action was that Petitioner

unsuccessfully sought relief for the same alleged

17 discriminatory

conduct under the New York state law that

18 bans discrimination

in employment.

The decision of the court of appeals is wrong

statute?

2

MR. BARRETT;

I don't really think it is necessary

3 for the Court to address the questions in those terms, Your
4 Honor.
5

QUESTION;

6 for a moment.

7
8 Title 7

Hell,

let's address them in those terms

Do you contend it was or wasn't?

MR. BARRETT;

Well, the entire statutory scheme of

presupposes a system in which there is first a state

9 proceeding,

then a proceeding before the EEOC, then a

10 proceeidng in federal court,
11 intended

and I think what Congress

was that all three of those steps should be given

12 their full force and effect.

13

QUESTION;

Well, certainly, but the full force and

14 effect of the review by the appellate division in New York
15 would not be given full effect if your contention prevails,
16 would it?
17

MR. BARRETT;

Your Honor,

I disagree with that.

18 The appellate division decided a question of state law,
19 first of all.

It didn't address Petitioner's Title 7 claims

20 as such, but that is really beside the point.
21 basic point is that Congress intended in

I think the

Title 7 to set up a

22 statutory scheme that had a certain duplication, a certain

23 overlapping of remedies, and that intent is clear, and it
24 has been recognized by this Court in numerous cases.
25

Petitioner was discharged by Respondent, Chemical

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Construction, from his job as a chemical engineer, and he
2 was denied re-employment on several occasions, allegedly on
3 the basis of his religion and national origin.

Petitioner

4 first filed his complaint with the EEOC, but the EEOC could
5 not act immediately on the charge, because Section 706(d) of
6 Title 7 requires it to refer the charge to the New York
7 State Division of Human Eights for processing under the
8 state human rights law.
9

The Human Rights Division eventually dismissed the

10 charge because it said that there was not probable cause to
11 believe it was true.

That state agency decision is the only

12 consideration that any government body, state or federal,
13 administrative or judicial, has ever given to the merits of
14 Petitioner’s claim of employment discrimination, yet the
15 Human Rights Division dismissed Petitioner's claim without
16 ever holding any formal hearing.
17

QUESTION;

Counsel, I suppose that a formal

18 hearing could have been held had the Petitioner requested it.
19
20 O'Connor.

MR. BARRETT;

No, that is not quite right, Justice

It is the Human Rights Division that decides

21 whether or not there is probable cause.

Only if it decides

22 there is probable cause is a hearing then held.

So it is

23 not a question of the Petitioner requesting it.
24

As Petitioner was entitled to do under state law,

25 he appealed the dismissal of his complaint both to an

22

QUESTION:

Would your position be different here

23 if the court review was de novo?
24

MR.

BARRETT:

Your Honor, that would obviously be

25 a very different case from this case.

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

So your answer is yes, it would be?

2

MR. BARRETT;

No,

I don’t think that it would be.

3 The reason that I say that is because I think that
4 Congress's intent in enacting Title 7 is what controls in
5 any event.

Now, as this Court has recognized in several

6 earlier cases,

the appropriate thing for a federal court to

7 do in a Title 7 case where there have been prior
8 proceedings, be they state, be they labor arbitration, be
9 they some other form of administrative review, is to give
10 those prior proceedings such weight as the district judge
11 considering all the circumstances of the earlier
12 determination, to give them such weight as the district
13 court finds to be appropriate.
14

QUESTION;

None of those cases involved a state

15 court determination, though, did they?
16

MR. BARRETT;

17

QUESTION;

That’s correct, Justice Rehnguist.

In that regard, Section 1738 really

18 only refers to a state judicial proceeding, does it not?
19

MR. BARRETT;

20 1738 refers to.

It is true that that is what Section

However, the common law and Section 1739,

21 which we mentioned in our reply brief, both make it clear
22 that in general, a state administrative determination of an
23 adjudicatory nature would be equally entitled to full faith
24 and credit, and I think we can see clearly that Congress
25 just didn't intend

those general procedural rules to apply

1 to Title 7 cases,

because it required resort to those state

2 proceedings.

3

QUESTION;

Going back to the state proceedings in

4 this case, which you addressed a few minutes ago in response
5 to my question, would you say that it is somewhat in the
6 nature of a

summary judgment proceeding that at least the

7 petitioner had an opportunity to offer testimony or
8 affidavits or such

things to avoid the result that occurred,

9 and simply didn't do it?
10

MR. BARRETT;

11 a fair analogy.
12 for example,

No,

I don't think that that is quite

The reason is that, in the federal court,

13 can move successfully for summary judgment, you have the

1 was going to benefit it most fully.
2

QUESTION:

But the agency had the power to compel

3 the Respondent to produce records.
4

NR. BARRETT:

5 what it wanted to do.

If the agency decided that that is
It is perhaps worth noting that in a

6 report just earlier this year, the New York State Bar
7 Association, a committee of the New York State Bar
8 Association that was composed of equal numbers of
9 representatives of employees and employers reached the
10 conclusion that with respect to both the Human Rights
11 Division and the administrative appeal board, that neither
12 agency has been funded to the degree necessary to enable it
13 satisfactorily to perform its responsibilities under the
14 human rights law.
15

I am not saying that that necessarily is what

16 happened in this case, but that is a bit of the flavor of
17 the kind of administrative proceeding that may exist in the
18 states.
19

I would also just like to point out that once

20 again, neither the administrative appeal board nor the
21 appellate division had any authority to hold any sort of de
22 novo hearing on Petitioner's claim, and moreover, with
23 respect to his going into state court, the administrative
24 decision that he received from the appeal board told him,
25 and I guote, that he could "obtain judicial review" and that

Now, ultimately both of those state bodies denied

MR. BARRETT:

The decision of the court of appeals disrupts the

thought out and very extensively debated

15 statutory scheme

that Congress enacted in Title 7.

13 EEOC would have had primary enforcement responsibility for
14 private cases as well.
15

Or, to put the argument a little bit differently,

16 as I said earlier,

the state legislature apparently believed

17 that it was necessary to have judicial review as part of its
18 state process for remedying discrimination claims.

The

19 decision below, however, gives the complainants an
20 unacceptable choice.

Either they may participate in the

21 state proceedings without invoking the judicial review

that

22 the legislature thought was essential as part of that

23 process, or they can forfeit their right to a federal court
24 determination of their claim, a right that, as this Court
25 has recognized a number of times. Congress clearly intended

AS AMICI CURIAE

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. WALLACE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

2 the Court, as the United States and the Equal Employment
3 Opportunity Commission see the matter, the holding below is
4 inconsistent with two aspects of Title 7’s scheme and
5 policies, and is contrary to the rationale of at least three
6 of this Court's Title 7 decisions.
7

QUESTION;

Mr. Wallace, I am just curious, the way

8 you put it and the way it is in your brief.

You say, the

9 United States and the EEOC?
19

MR. WALLACE;

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct.

Those are two different -Kell, we have joined together.

The

13 Department of Justice, the Attorney General has some
14 enforcement responsibilities under Title 7, and the EEOC has
15 others.
16

QUESTION;

And so you would be here even if the

17 EEOC wasn't?
18

MR. WALLACE:

That is correct, but they have

19 joined in the brief.
20

QUESTION:

Does the EEOC have a right to carry on

21 its own litigation up through this Court?
22

MR. WALLACE:

Up through all courts other than the

23 Supreme Court, by statute.

But we represent the EEOC in

24 this Court.
25

The two aspects of the scheme and policies of

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Title 7 that I am referring to are, one, that in holding
2 that a judgment of a state court reviewing a state agency's
3 action on a state law claim may have preclusive effect on
4 litigation of federal claims in federal court, the holding
5 below would discourage the full pursuit of state remedies by
6 complainants of employment discrimination, precisely the
7 policy that this Court expressed concern about in its
8 decision in New York Gaslight Club against Carey.

The

9 policy of Title 7 is to encourage the full use and, Congress
10 hoped, the resolution of many employment discrimination
11 claims through available state procedures,

and that policy

12 would be frustrated if full pursuit of those procedures
13 would have adverse conseguences on the ability to assert the
14 federal claim.
15

The other aspect of Title 7 that we find

16 irreconcilable with the decision of the court of appeals is
17 that Title 7 itself specifies that the EEOC in conducting
18 its business is to give substantial weight, that it nowhere
19 says anything about preclusive effect, it says substantial
20 weight to the findings of state authorities that have
21 previously been invoked with respect to the same claim.
22

Now, in most instances, to be sure, the EEOC is

23 unlikely to find reasonable cause to believe that a
24 violation has occurred when there has been an adverse
25 resolution to the complainant in the state proceedings, but

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

there are instances in which, in light of everything

the evidence

weight Congress prescribes, the Commission

24 that the state administrative agency did

25 or capriciously or abuse its discretion or make a procedural

400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 error under state law in dismissing the complaint.
2

QUESTION;

What if the state court had found that

3 there simply was no discrimination?
4

MB. WALLACE;

Well, that would be a different

5 question, and I believe that the scheme of Title 7 would not
6 give preclusive effect to that, although weight would be
7 given to it, but if I may finish my thought here, there is
8 no attempt to re-examine in the federal court whether an
9 error was made by the state administrative agency in
10 dismissing a complaint under state law.

The other aspect of

11 the New York scheme is that if one asserts this
12 administrative remedy, then it cannot resort to any other
13 remedy under stata law.

There is no attempt being made in

14 federal court to resort to any other remedy under state
15 law.

It is entirely speculative to think that the New York

16 courts would give this judgment any preclusive effect in a
17 Titie 7 suit.
18

Our position, as we stated in the Court last term,

19 is that the New York courts don't have jurisdiction to
20 entertain Title 7 suits, and the question would never even
21 arise.

In any event, neither the agency nor the reviewing

22 court had any authority under New York law to consider a
23 Title 7 case in this case.
24

So, I don't see that 1738 is in the case, myself.

25

QUESTION;

Don't you think 1738 covers collateral

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT LAYTON, ESQ.,

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

19

MR. LAYTON;

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please

20 the Court, this is a claim preclusion case.

It centers on a

21 judgment of the New York appellate division, first
22 department, one of that state's second highest appellate
23 courts.

In light of what has been said here earlier, I must

24 emphasize that this was a final judgment in the state of New
25 York, and its finality emanates from a legislative act, New

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 York Executive Law Section 298, which reads as follows.
2

QUESTION:

May I ask, because I know you will get

3 to it in a minute, but if there were no appeal to the New
4 York court, but really merely just an administrative finding
5 in the New York system, would you make the same argument you
6 are making today but base it on
7
8 not.

ME. LAYTON:

1739 instead?

No, sir, Your Honor.

Absolutely

We don’t think that 1739 is in the remotest way

9 relevant.

1739 is a statute which merely deals with the

10 books and records such as birth certificate entries,
11 driver’s license entries in one state and another state.

It

12 does not deal and purport to deal with the preclusive effect
13 of administrative agency determinations.
14

Secondarily, we believe Title 7, properly read,

15 specifically intended not to give preclusive effect to state
16 agency determinations.
17 says.

That is exactly what the statute

What is missed here is the fact that this was a

18 judgment of a court, and I believe that Section

1738, under

19 traditional doctrines of claim preclusion which have been
20 enforced by this Court for at least 200 years, is the proper
21 guide here.
22

The question follows thereafter as to whether

23 Title 7, in 1964 and 1972, repealed in any manner the
24 pre-existing judicial and statutory circumstances, and it is
25 our belief that without even reaching the doctrine of

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 repeal, that these two statutes are read together easily and
2 there is no difficulty because the position asserted by
3 Petitioner and the government is fundamentally incorrect.
4

Title 7 and its language, as Justice White

5 correctly indicated, used the language,
6 authorities".

"state and local

Beyond that, in the statute itself,

"state

7 and local agencies" are used interchangeably with "state and
8 local authorities".

Indeed, as recognized by the EEOC, its

9 own regulations, which we have quoted in the supplemental
10 appendix, and I call the Court's attention to Supplemental
11 Appendix Page 59 to

60, this is the EEOC, 29 CFR, deferrals

12 to state and local authorities.

See 706 agency defined.

13 And these regulations are replete -- Year after year EEOC
14 has defined what they think state and local authorities are,
15 and
16

they are agencies.
The statutory history of the Act refers to state

17 fair employment agencies.

There is a substantial and a

18 critical difference between an agency and a court, and I
19 would like to call the attention of the Court to its
20 decision in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver, which has been
21 cited by Petitioner on its behalf, but I think incorrectly,
22 and with respect, at 415 US 47,

there is a critical

23 statement by the Court in Alexander which reads, if I may,
24 as follows;
25

"Consistent with this view, Title 7 provides for

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 consideration of employment discrimination claims in several
2 forums," and the Court then cites the statute.

The first is

3 EEOC.

The third is

The second is state and local agencies.

4 federal courts.

It then says,

"and in general,

submission

5 of a claim to one forum does not preclude a later submission
6 to another, and its footnote clearly indicates by that it
7 meant that Commission action is not barred by findings and
8 orders of state or local agencies, and then it calls
9 attention to McDonald-Douglas v. Green, which holds that
10 proposition.

The mere fact that the EEOC did not find

11 probable cause is no bar.

Congress, as recognized by this

12 Court, was understanding that there were three forums
13 involved, the EEOC, state and local agencies, and then the
14 federal court, and none of the decisions of this Court read
15 against that.
16

QUESTION:

May I just ask you another question?

17

MR. LAYTON:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
Your position,

as I understand it,

19 then, is that if a plaintiff or a claimant loses in the
20 state agency, he then has a right under state law to appeal
21 and he might also be able to bring a federal suit.

I must say,

with the record that is

Otherwise, he will lose his right

16 to go into the federal court if he takes an appeal.

proceeding,

then it may — it may be

7

We don't argue here that Congress thought by

to the state agencies and giving them an

9 opportunity, primarily
10 some effort at solving

through conciliation, and through
the problem -- it wasn’t an adversary

Do you think Congress intended to draw

13 that kind of distinction?
14

MR. LAYTON;

What we are concerned about, and we

15 have said, is that we do not believe that Congress wanted to
16 trap Title 7 claimants, and we do not believe that Congress
17 thought that they should be relegated to second class kind
18 of treatment in the states.

We do believe that in that

19 unusual circumstance, and we think it is unusual —
20

QUESTION;

Well, it is second class only in the

21 sense that they don't have a right to appeal.
22

MR. LAYTON;

Well, but your postulate is a very

23 narrow right of appeal.
24

QUESTION;

Yes.

25

MR. LAYTON;

Yes.

But to answer your question, we

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

What we would say is not

2 preclusive is that the state set up a sham or a phoney
8 system.

I think Congress was concerned about that, and we

4 would -- we have a view that that kind of transparent
5 judicial non-review would not or should not command
6 preclusive effect.

But we believe that Congress at the time

7 that it enacted this statute was aware of what, if I may
8 refer to as the ordinary rules of the game, that litigation
9 exists, that the ordinary rules have applied for over 200
10 years, and there is nothing that we have uncovered that
11 would indicate that it didn't; to the extent that we have
12 uncovered anything, there would be an indication, and the
13 comment we quoted of Senator Javits, that to the extent
14 Congress considered the matter at all, they were aware that
15 in 1972, claim preclusion, res judicata was alive and
16 well -17

QUESTION*

You don't need to argue for any kind of

18 preclusion here other than in a case where the state
19 judicial proceeding purports to include a judgment that the
20 discrimination determination was not arbitrary or
21 unreasonable.

That is all you need to get preclusion.

You

22 don't need to say that -- Suppose the only issue -- suppose
23 there was an administrative finding, and the only issue that
24 the claimant took to the courts was, he was denied the right
25 to -- he was denied a subpoena, and he was turned down.

the state proceeding went to its conclusion

There wasn't a

QUESTION;

Mr. Layton, under your theory, now, I

7 suppose that a state that basically were hostile to Title 7

9 instance, an automatic right to review in the state
10 appellate proceedings for all these claims and then preclude
11 everybody thereafter.

12

MR. LAYTON;

You mean, compel all discrimination

13 claimants to appeal -14

QUESTION;

Sure.

I mean,

wouldn't -- under your

15 theory, isn't it possible that a state that basically was
16 hostile to permitting Title 7 claims to be heard in the
17 federal courts could set up a system that would effectively
18 preclude everybody?

I am not suggesting the state would set

19 up a system that was unfair within the state hearing
20 processes.

That would be a different question.

But isn't

21 that a possibility?
22

MR. LAYTON;

Slim.

I think the answer is the

23 answer I gave to Justice Stevens, which is that on the 61st
24 day a claimant would then -- he could enter the federal
25 district court.

I do suggest that if there were some

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

devilish scheme that was concocted which somehow compelled

him, trapped him and held him into the state system, I do

3

think that is a matter at a later date, and not under the

4

facts of this case, that this Court might well take, but I

5

do think that under the present rules, on the 61st day he

6

has easily the freedom to try his case in the federal

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID A. BARRETT, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

6

MR. BARRETT;

Just very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice,

7

First of all, with respect to Justice Stevens'

8 question concerning Section

1739, if you look at the

9 operative language
10 practical purposes,
11 date from the very
12 very gener al proced
13 for exampl e.

And i

14 relatively limited
15 discrimina tion, ena
16 simply acted under
17 weight that was to
18 preceded a Title 7
19 court.
20

Congress never intended to force a litigant to

21 choose to abandon h:
22 state.

It wouldn't

23 that is wh at it int
24

Petitione: has been trying for six years to get a
Petitioner

25 hearing on his disc

1 of court not for sleeping on his rights but for pursuing
2 them too diligently in what you might call exhausting state
3 remedies.

If he failed to anticipate that the second

4 circuit would rule as it did in the Sinicropi case, which is
5 the one that we are all concerned with here, he was in good
6 company.

District Judge Pierce in a decision in this very

7 case before Sinicropi was decided held that he was not
8 precluded, and now four other circuits, looking at the
9 legislative history and at this Court's decisions, have
10 reached the same result as Judge Pierce.
11

That is the proper reading of a remedial statute

12 such as Title 7,

aDd

it is the only result that is

13 consistent with the holdings and the spirit of this Court’s
14 decision in Alexander, in Chandler and, I think, most
15 particularly, in New York Gaslight Club, where the Court
16 looked at this very same New York procedure, clearly saw
17 that it encompassed judicial review.
18

And to answer one final point, we don't say that

19 the employer would be barred any more than the claimant
20 would be from litigating in federal court if the claimant
21 elects to pursue his Title 7 action there.

What is fair for

22 one is fair for the other, we think, so I don't think the
23 Court needs to have any concern on that score.
24

All we are asking here is for the de novo trial

25 before a federal judge that Congress intended, and we hope

37

2 Circuit.

Thank you.
