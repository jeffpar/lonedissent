ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON W. KELLAHIN, ESQ.,

7
8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KELLAHINs

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court, this case is here on certiorari to the
10 Tenth Circuit, and involves the power of an Indian tribe to
11 tax non-Indians who are lawfully on the reservation.

The

12 case was argued on March the 30th of this year and by order
13 of the Court was set for reargument here today.
14

The facts of the case are quite simple, but the

15 issues, the legal issues involved direct us to some
16

17

fundamental constitutional questions.
The case involves the Jicarilla Apache Tribe,

18 which is an Indian tribe occupying an Executive Order Indian
19 reservation located in the northwestern part of the state of

20 New Mexico.

The reservation is located in an area ceded to

21 the United States by Mexico under the Treaty of
22 Guadalupe-Hidalgo.
23

QUESTION;

24 tribal sovereignty,
25

So there is no question of inherent
I take it.

MR. KELLAHIN;

That is our position, because

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 neither Spain nor Mexico ever recognized any sovereignty
2 existed.
3

2UESTI0N:

In fact, Article VIII of the Treaty of

4 Guadalupe-Hidalgo makes special provisions for Mexican
5 title, but none for Indian title.
6

MR. KELLAHIN:

That is correct.

The only mention

7 of Indians at all is in Article XI, which deals with the
8 obligation of the United States to prevent incursions into
9 the country of Mexico.

So we have no sovereignty existing

10 as of that date, and that was recognized by this Court in
11 the case of Lake Corporation of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
12 Saints, where they said that the only sovereign at that date
13 was the United States itself, and all other sovereignty must
14 of necessity be derived from that source, and that goes
15 directly to this question of inherent sovereignty, which is
16 an issue involved here today.

17

The Jicarilla Tribe is organized under the Indian

18 Reorganization Act.

It adopted a constitution, and

that

19 constitution purports to give it the right to tax

20 non-Indians.

The Petitioners have been on the reservation

21 for -- some of them for many years, under oil and gas
22 leases, some of which were issued at least 30 years ago.
23 They were issued pursuant to federal law, under regulations
24 promulgate! by the Secretary of the Interior.

They were

25 assigned on behalf of the tribe and were approved by the

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Secretary of Interior as required by law.
2

Now, we are not here challenging any provisions of

3 those leases.

We are not quarreling about any rental or

4 royalty that has been assessed pursuant to the agreement
5 under which the Petitioners entered the reservation.

What

6 we are challenging is a severance tax ordinance which was
7 adopted by the tribe in 1976, which imposed a tax on oil and
8 gas sold or transported off the reservation.
9

The Petitioners brought suit in the District Court

10 of New Mexico, which held that the ordinance was invalid and
11 void.

The Court of Appeals, in reversing that decision,

12 held that the power to tax was an attribute of inherent
13 sovereignty, since no treaty or Act of Congress authorized
14 it, and the power to tax was not pre-empted by the federal
15 government, and it did not violate the commerce clause.
16

Now, that gives us the three issues we want to

17 discuss here today.

I would like to address the first

18 issue, the question of the inherent Indian sovereignty.

My

19 colleague will discuss the pre-emption by federal law and

20 the issue of the commerce clause.
21

The Secretary in his supplemental brief recognized

22 the issue we are talking about very clearly when he said,
23 "The dispositive point is whether the Jicarilla Tribe is
24 entitled to exercise and is here exercising the sovereign
25 prerogative of taxation as the United States or a state or a

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 municipality might do."

With that, we agree.

That is

2 exactly what we are here to talk about.
3

Now, if it is true that the tribe is exercising

4 that kind of an authority, the authority to tax, as does the
5 federal government or a state, and that in the absence of
6 any constitutional provision or treaty or Act of Congress,
7 then the tribe is necessarily exercising governmental powers
8 over non-members of the tribe, and under our constitutional
9 system, the powers of all governments are derived from the
10 people.
11

That is fundamental to our country.
Within the boundaries of the United States, the

12 Americans have consented to federal and state governmental
13 power over their liberty and their property.

As safeguards

14 against the abuse of this power, our government is
15 controlled through the democratic processes, and the
16 exercise of such powers is subject to constitutional
17 limitations.
18

In this nation, the sovereign governs only with

19

the consent of the governed.

This fundamental aspect of

20

political control is wholly lacking here, where the

21 Jicarilla Tribe seeks to assert governmental power over
22 non-members of the tribe who are forever barred from any
23 participation in tribal affairs.
24

It is our position that the tribe does not have

25 any such sovereign power except, and their right to tax is

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 limited to, the right to condition the entry of non-Indians
2 or non-members of the tribe onto their reservations.

That

3 is the tenor of all the cases dealing with this issue,
4 including the most recent.
5

These Petitioners are on Jicarilla reservation

6 under valid oil and gas leases issued long before there was
7 any attempt to tax.

The leases stated the conditions under

8 which they could enter, and the conditions that would permit
9 them to remain, and taxation was not one of those
10 conditions.

Yet, an examination of the cases cited by the

11 Respondents in this case show that -12

QUESTION:

Is there a clause that I recall in that

13 lease that they cannot alter the royalty structure?
14

MR. KELLAHIN ;

That is correct.

Neither the

15 rental nor the royalty may be increased during the life of
16 the lease, Your Honor, and we submit that this is a veiled
17 attempt to do exactly that in the name of taxation.

They

18 call it a tax, but it is adding an additional burden on

the

19 production from the lease.
20

The other cases that have been relied on all

21 involve the right of the tribes to impose conditions on
22 those who enter on the reservations.

This is true of the

23 early cases, like the grazing feed cases, from Morris versus
24 Hitchcock on down to Colville, where this Court upheld the
25 tribe's right to collect a cigarette tax.

8

1

In the recent case of Montana versus the United

2 States, it was pointed out very clearly that the sovereignty
3 exercised by Indian tribes extends only to the right to make
4 their own laws and be governed by them.

Nowhere in our

5 jurisprudence do we find anything that says that tribes have
6 a right to make laws and govern others by them, as they are
7 attempting to do here.

8

QUESTION*

Mr. Kellahin, the Colville case

9 appeared to articulate a position that it is a fundamental
10 attribute of sovereignty, the power to tax transactions on
11 the trust lands.
12

MR. KELLAHIN:

13

QUESTIONS

That is very true, Your Honor.

There wasn’t an articulation there, as

14 I read it, of basing it on the power to exclude non-members
15 from the reservation.

How do you distinguish the Colville

16 case?
17

MR. KELLAHIN;

The Court had used that language,

18 but it was wholly unnecessary to the decision, because in
19 another portion of the decision it pointed out that those

20 who would avoid the tax -21

QUESTION;

Well, the Colville case also came as a

22 result of the Treaty of Point Elliott with Indians who were
23 ceding lands over which they had tribal sovereignty as
24 opposed to the Jicarilla Apaches, who came in by virtue of
25 the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, did it not?

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. KELLAHINs

1

That is correct, Your Honor.

There

2 was no treaty involved with the Jicarilla Apache tribe.
3 There never was a treaty reached with the Jicarillas.
4

QUESTIONS

Didn't the Jicarillas win a case before

5 the Indian Claims Commission that they had been deprived of
6 their tribal lands, their aboriginal lands?

Their

7 aboriginal title?
8

MR. KELLAHIN :

9

QUESTION s

10

Yes, Justice White --

Didn't they --

MR. KELLAHIN;

They were awarded some $9.5

11 million, I believe, for the loss of their aboriginal tribal
12 lands, which were very loosely defined as the area east of
13 the Rio Grande over which they had historically roamed.
14

QUESTION;

15

MR. KELLAHIN:

16

17

Was that ever reviewed by this Court?
I believe not.

I believe not, Your

Honor.
Getting back. Justice O'Connor, to your question,

18 I would distinguish Colville on the grounds that no one has
19

to go buy -- they were marketing a tax exemption, as this

20 Court deary pointed out, and it was not a true tax in the
21 sense that a state or federal government tax is imposed for
22 the reason there is no sanction.

It was an optional thing

23 in the first place, and it was accepted or you could reject
24

it, and if you accepted it, you had no choice but to pay the

25

tax, and that was the ruling in Buster versus Wright, one of

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the early tax cases, where the Court very clearly pointed
2 out that this was an optional thing.

Those who wanted to go

3 on the reservation and trade under Buster versus Wright were
4 required to pay the tax.
5

QUESTION:

Well,

I suppose no one is forced to go

6 on the reservation and buy or lease oil or mineral rights.
7

MR.

KELLAHIN:

That is correct, but the point is,

8 we are already -- our Petitioners are already there, and
9 they were there before there was any tax.

The conditions of

10 their entry, it is our position, were imposed by the leases,
11 and now this is a modification of those leases, and I would
12 draw that distinction from Colville.
13

In Montana, this Court held that the exercise of

14 tribal power beyond what is necessary to protect tribal
15 self-government or to control internal relations is
16 inconsistent with their dependent status, and so cannot
17 survive without Congressional delegation.

There has been no

18 Congressional delegation of this authority here, as there
19 was in some of the other cases such

as Morris versus

20 Hitchcock and some of the others.
21

The Montana court did

-- Montana case did

22 admittedly hold that the tribe does exercise some forms of
23 civil jurisdiction over non-members of the tribe, and may do
24 this through taxation, licensing, or other means and
25 activities of non-members who enter into consentual

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 relations with the tribe.
2

Now, I think that is the key word in that portion

3 of the decision.

They enter into a consentual arrangement

4 with the tribe through commercial dealings, contracts,
5 leases, or other arrangements.
6 done.

Now, that is what we have

We have entered into a consentual relationship with

7 the tribe, of which taxation was no part.

The Petitioners

8 view this as upholding what we were just talking about in
9 the -- case.

They have a right to impose a tax if it is a

10 condition of entering onto the reservation, but they did not
11 do so at the time, and
12 we are already on and

they cannot in our view do it after
have spent some millions of dollars in

13 developing these leases.

We can't pick up the leases and go

14 elsewhere, as was suggested in Colville.

We either pay the

15 tax or we lose the lease.
16

The Colville case is consistent, in our view, with

17 the argument which we

are now making, and this result does

18 not require a finding

of governmental sovereignty on a par

19 with that of the federal government or the state such as is

20 sought to be asserted here.

Under the ruling, Colville is

21 argued perhaps that the tribe had a significant interest,
22 which was one of the key arguments in the Colville decision,
23 that the tribe had a significant interest in the subject
24 matter which enabled it to tax, and of course we do not deny
25 that the tribe has a significant interest in its tribal

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 lands
2

However, the reservation lands are held in trust

3 for it by the United States government.

The manner in which

4 the oil and gas leases are going to be handled, both
5 issuance of the leases in the first instance, their
6 development, and the manner of payment of royalties and
7 rentals is all controlled by federal regulation, and the
8 tribe's interest in the lands insofar as the oil and gas
9 mineral interest is concerned was assigned for the terms of
10 the leases, and we submit that they have no significant
11 interest remaining at this time, as was contemplated in
12 Colville, which would support this tax.
13

QUESTION:

Is it your position that this tribe

14 does not possess sovereignty in the traditional sense that
15 we have referred to that and other cases?
16

MR. KELLRHIN:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, I do not

17 feel they have the sovereignty as the Court has referred to
18 in other cases, but I think an analysis of the other cases
19

would indicate that the sovereignty the Court has talked

20 about down through the years was something considerably less
21 than true sovereignty, and the more recent cases have
22 limited the scope of that sovereignty step by step.

For

23 example, we come to the Oliphant, where they were attempting
24 to assert criminal jurisdiction over a non-Indian on the
25 reservation, and this Court held that that jurisdiction

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 could not be exercised.

In Montana, the Court interpreted that ruling as

2

3 applying also to the civil area, and
4 not

feel that we are really talking about true sovereignty

5 in the sense of the old cases.
6 Appeals should be reversed.

We submit that the Court of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN R. COONEY, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. COONEY*

10
11 Court,
12 not

for that reason, I do

Chief Justice, and may it please the

we support the argument that the Constitution does

permit Indian tribes to tax production by non-Indian

13 lessees.

My argument will be that assuming for the sake of

14 argument that such

power exists, the Indian tax here

15 violates the commerce clause, and is pre-empted by 25 United
16 States Code Section
17

If such a power of taxation is found to exist,

18 fundamental
19 must be

398(C).

constitutional concerns require that that tax

subject to the restraints of the Constitution,

20 the tribe and the

Secretary argue here not only that the

21 tribe may tax other

than as a condition of entry, but that

22 those powers are not subject to

the negative implications of

23 the commerce clause which prohibits states and lesser
24 sovereigns from impeding
25

but

the free flow of commerce.

We submit that if this argument is accepted,

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Indian tribes will be invited to impose discriminatory taxes
2 which unduly burden commerce as the Jicarilla have done
3 here, and
4

QUESTION;

Nell, there is certainly nothing in the

5 original grant to Congress of the power to regulate commerce
6 among the several states to suggest that there is a negative
7 implication to it, is there?

That in the absence of

8 Congressional action, a state act might be found violative
9 of that clause.
10

MR. COONEY:

Justice Rehnguist, that is what we

11 submit is wrong with the Secretary's argument here.

That

12 same argument, the affirmative power of Congress to prevent
13 states from burdening commerce was urged early on in this
14 Court's consideration of the commerce clause to prevent the
15 Court from finding negative implications in the clause

16 limiting the powers of states.

This is the first

17 opportunity the Court has had to consider the application of
18 the commerce clause with the powers of Indian tribes over
19 commerce, perhaps because it is

the first instance in which

20 Indian tribes have attempted to exert such powers over
21 commerce.
22

2UESTI0N;

Well, maybe the Court went wrong a long

23 time ago.
24

MR. COONEY:

Your Honor, the jurisprudence finding

25 the negative implications is so well established in this

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Court and has been for decades that we believe the Court was
2 not wrong and that those same negative implications must
3 restrain the powers of Indian tribes.
4

QUESTION;

Well, may I ask, Mr. Nordhaus as I

5 understand it, this severance tax, of course, was approved
6 by the Secretary of the Interior, was it not?
7

MR. COONEY;

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. COONEY;

Yes, Your Honor.
Pursuant to a Congressional statute?
Your Honor,

we find no statute which

10 requires the Secretary to approve the tax.
11

QUESTION;

Where did the Secretary get the

12 authority?
13

MR. COONEY;

The tribal constitution states that

14 the Secretary should approve the tribal ordinances, but we
15 submit that the mere fact of federal approval of the Indian
16 taxing -17

QUESTION;

18 federal approval.

I am not speaking so much just of
You suggest that the Secretary's

19 authority to approve it derives from the Indian

20 constitution , not from the Congress?
21

MR. COONEY:

There is nothing in the IRA, nothing

22 in the Indian Reorganization Act which requires the
23 Secretary to approve tribal taxing ordinances.
24

QUESTION;

Well,

I am not thinking it requires.

25 Does it authorize it?

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. COONEY;

Your Honor, to the extent that it

2

authorizes the Secretary to approve tribal constitutions and

3

the tribal constitution provides for Secretarial approval of

4

taxing ordinances --

5

QUESTION;

Of course, you see what I am getting at.

6

MR. COONEY;

7

QUESTION;

Yes.
If in fact, accepting your argument,

8

does it apply here at all if there has been Congressional

9

authorization and federal approval of this severance tax?

10

11
12

MR. COONEY;

Well, there has been no federal

approval by Congress of an Indian severance tax whatsoever.
QUESTION;

Well, I gather that depends on how we

13

are going to read the authorization that went to the

14

Secretary, doesn't it?

15

MR. COONEY;

That's correct, Your Honor, and we

16

think that Congress could not have intended under the 1927

17

Act, which I will discuss in a moment, that the states would

18

have to share the right of taxation with the tribe, and that

19

the tribal tax impacts the state tax by affecting the amount

20

of production against which the state tax is measured.

21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION;

Is this provision in the Indian

constitution unique, or is that a common pattern?
MR. COONEY;

Apparently not, Your Honor, because a

similiar provision or -QUESTION;

Apparently not which?

-- or a similar approval was in the

The Secretary approved the Indian cigarette

7 oust or diminish the state's power of taxation granted by
8 the
9

1927 Act.

Now,

we --

QUESTION;

In other words, the only Congressional

10 action that would answer your argument on the negative
11 implications of the Indian commerce clause would have to be
12 an affirmative Congressional authority to the tribes to
13 impose the tax.
14

MR. COONEY;

Affirmative Congressional authority,

15 and we think in this case coupled with an affirmative
16 Congressional withdrawal of the grant to the states in 1927
17 of the power to tax the same production.

Now, the commerce

18 clause has to limit the power of the tribes, we believe, and
19 the commerce clause,

or this tax violates the commerce

20 clause in several respects.
21

QUESTION;

Counsel, before going on with that, and

22 before you leave the approval of the Secretary, do we not in
23 this instance also have an Indian -- a tribal constitution
24 adopted under the Indian Reorganization Act, which
25 constitution contains a provision saying that they have the

MR. COONEY:

4

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor, we do.
And isn't that pursuant to a

5 Congressional enactment, the Indian Reorganization Act, that
6 gave him the power to do that?
7

MR. COONEY:

No, Your Honor, we don't think that

8 the Indian Reorganization Act authorized the Secretary to
9 create any governmental powers in Indian tribes.

As a

10 matter of fact, the legislative history shows that the first
11 draft of that Act would have granted federal and municipal
12 powers to tribes, and that was not acceptable to Congress.
13 The Oliphant case recognizes, I believe, that the IRA did
14 not create any powers in Indian tribes which did not
15 theretofore exist, and we are led back to the same question
16 of whether the power exists in the first place.
17

Now, the plain language of this ordinance, we

18 believe, discriminates against interstate commerce.

It

19 taxes only gas or oil sold or transported off the
20 reservation, and we think the tribe has attempted to create
21 a favored position for on reservation industry.

The classic

22 discrimination represented by that type of a scheme has been
23 struck down by this Court many times.
24

Secondly, as the tax is imposed only when the

25 production is transported off the reservation, it is a

1 appropriate nexus with the jurisdiction, that each tax is
2 properly apportioned, and that each tax does not
3 discriminate, assuming the tribal ordinance were amended,
4 and both can claim that each government provides the
5 taxpayers with the benefits and advantages of a civilized
6 society.

Therefore, both the tribe and the state can claim

7 the right to impose and they have imposed general taxes for
8 the support of government against the full value of the
9 production, without any apportionment.
10

Now, the traditional tests of Complete Auto and

11 Washington Stevedoring provide no solution to the multiple
12 burden problem present here.

The tribe and the state are

13 concentric sovereigns, and neither has any power over the
14 taxing policy of the other.

The tribal tax impacts the

15 state tax by affecting the ability to produce in paying
16 quantities and rendering marginal wells economic, thereby
17 reducing the amount of production against which the state
18 tax is measured.
19

We think this problem is analogous to that

20 presented in Japan Line.

There, the Court subjected the

21 California shipping container tax to an extended analysis
22 beyond the traditional four-part test, and struck down the
23 tax because no tribunal with jurisdiction over both
24 California and Japan could prevent the multiple burden.

25

While it is true that this Court has jurisdiction

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 over the tribe and the state, Commonwealth Edison teaches
2 that it is inappropriate for the judiciary to attempt to
3 measure the rate of a general tax for the support of
4 government against the value of benefits provided to the
5 taxpayer.

Judicial resolution of the multiple burden here

6 would require not only measurement of the benefits provided
7 by the state and the tribe against the tax levied by age,
8 but also some formula for apportioning those general taxes
9 between the two sovereigns.
10

Furthermore, if the Secretary is right in his

11 commerce clause claim that the commerce clause doesn't even
12 bind the tribe, then it would seem the Court would have no
13 jurisdiction to invalidate the tribal tax and the result in
14 Japan Line would seem to require invalidation of the state
15 tax, which would directly contradict the grant in 1927 by
16 Congress to the states of the right to tax.
17

The Court, then, we submit, is not the tribunal

18 which can or should allocate between the state and the tribe
19 the right to tax, and while Congress has the power to act,
20 Congress did act in 1927 to grant to the states the right to
21 tax the production on these reservations.

They made a clear

22 choice, granting the rentals, royalties, and bonuses to the

23 tribe, an income which was more than sufficient in 1976 to
24 support the entire tribal government.

25

QUESTION:

Counsel, you state they made a clear

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 choice.

Do you think they had this possibility of tribal

2 taxation in mind at all?
3

MR. COONEY;

Yes, Your Honor.

In 1901 they

4 authorized the imposition of taxes for the benefits of
5 Indians in the Right of Way Acts in 27 USC, Sections 319 and
6 321.

That history, coupled with the fact that this state

7 tax was allowed to be applied against the share obtained for
8 the Indians as well, leads us to conclude, along with the
9 three years of debate and the fight between the states and
10 the representatives of the Indians over who should get the
11 royalties, that Congress could not have intended, in view of
12 the economics of oil and gas production, that the state's
13 tax would have to be shared with an Indian tax.
14

We think the most compelling argument for the

15 preclusive effect of the 1927 Act is the recommendation of
16 Congress's own agency, the American Indian Policy Review

17 Commission, in 1977, that the 1927 Act and the 1924 Act,
18 which similarly grants states rights of taxation on treaty
19 reservations, should be amended or repealed to permit tribal
20 taxation of such production.

21

The Natural Gas Policy Act pass-through provision

22 in 1978 specifically left the validity of these tribal taxes

23 up to this Court in this case.

We think that any

24 reconsideration of that policy permitting the states to tax
25 this production, which necessarily precludes tribal

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 taxation, should be left to Congress, as was the question of
2 any limitation on the state's rights to tax production under
3 the Mineral Leasing Act left to Congress last term in
4 Commonwealth Edison.
5

If the

1927 Act is not an outright pre-emption,

6 both the tribe and the state obviously can’t tax at full
7 value without a mutliple burden on commerce, and the

1927

8 Act is at least a clear Congressional choice for the state

1

MR. NORDHAUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it please

2 the Court, in answer to the argument that tribal sovereignty
3 was not recognized in New Mexico and Arizona as a result of
4 the Treaty of Guaialupe-Hidalgo, I only want to state that
5 neither the federal government, federal officials, nor this
6 Court has ever differentiated between the sovereignty of
7 tribes in New Mexico and Arizona and elsewhere in the United
8 S ta tes.
9

QUESTION;

May there not be good reason for such

10 differentiation, when you are interpreting the treaty of
11 Point Elliott and saying that you -- in Washington, and
12 saying that you resolve all ambiguities in favor of people
13 who didn't understand English well, and when you are
14 interpreting an Executive Order which was disposing of lands
15 that were already completely under the dominion of the
16 United States as the result of a treaty with another foreign
17 sovereign?
18

MR. NORDHAUS;

Your Honor, there was no reference

19 to Indian tribes, and so there was no inference that Indian
20 tribes wera even mentioned, and the fact that officials of
21 the United States negotiated treaties with Indian tribes in
22 the early fifties, immediately after the treaty, indicates
23 that those officials recognized the sovereignty of these
24 tribes, and throughout the years there has been no question
25 as to the sovereign status of tribes in that area.

11 sovereignty has been recognized, and a tribe, even though it

13

MR. NORDHAUS:

It is still recognized, and it has

15 S ta tes.
16

To go to the main portion of the argument, I think

17 we have to go back to the statement of Felix Cohn that has
18 often been repeated by this Court, and is most significant,
19

is that one of the powers essential to the maintenance of

20 any government is the power to levy taxes, and I think in
21 order to understand the problem in the situation of the
22 western tribes with large areas to govern, we should take a
23
24

look at the Jicarilla Apache reservation.
It contains 750,000 acres in a mountainous area of

25 northwest New Mexico, near the Colorado border.

It is

located, and it is remote from Santa Fe, the state capital.

There are, outside of one federal highway and two state

4

roads, the road network, which is extensive, serving the oil

5

and gas lessees and others, is maintained by the tribe out

6

of tribal funds, and to some extent by the BIA.

7

Law and order is maintained by a tribal police

8

force of 20 officers, some of whom are deputized by the

state of New Mexico, but all paid out of tribal funds, as

10

compared to one tribal police officer who must patrol the

entire reservation.

QUESTION

Yes
before you go on, I would like to be

6 Do you think basically that the cases from this Court which

9 exclude non-members from the territory of the reservation?
10

NR. NORDHAUS;

11 with that thesis.
12 to

Your Honor, I disagree completely

A power to tax that is based

13 of a landlord, and

on

a power

It is

a power

none of the earlier cases really based

14 the power to tax on the power to exclude, and I go back to
15 Morris against Hitchcock, in 1904, which placed the tax on
16 cattle on the Chickasaw reservation, the taxes imposed in
17 June or July of 1904, and attached cattle that were already
18 on

the reservation in January of that year,

19 of

the bases on which the tax was attacked.

20

and that was one

Again, in Buster against Wright, the tax was

21 applied to owners of business lots, a business activity tax
22 was applied to those who were on the reservation owning
23 property and who could not be excluded, and if you -- if the
24 contention is that the power to tax is based on the power to

25 exclude, you are saying that these oil and gas lessees who

30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 have been on the reservation for 25 or 30 years, and whose
2 leases may extend through production by another 20 or 30
3 years, that the tribe has no power to chance the conditions
4 of their occupancy.
5

In other word, they have a diplomatic immunity

6 forever from any change in the conditions on the
7 reservation.

QUESTION:

What,

then, do you do with the case of

9 United States against Cagama, which says that the only two
10 sovereign entities recognized by the Constitution are the
11 federal government and the state governments?
12

MR. NORDHAUS ;

Well, Your Honor, the tribal

13 governments are dependent sovereign governments.

They exist

14 -- their sovereign powers can be divested by Congress.

But

15 until Congress acts, they retain those powers, as this Court
16 said in U. S. v.

Wheeler.

They retain all the powers which

17 they had which are not divested or which are inconsistent
18 with their status, and our contention is that there is
19 nothing in

the tax power that is inconsistent with the

20 status of tribes.
21

In other words, tribal governments cannot exist

22 without taxation, and taxation that is appropriate for one
23 tribe may be inappropriate for another.

The tribes have to

24 levy the taxes where they find the resource on which to
25 tax.

And we believe that this type of tax comes within the

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

QUESTION;

Do you think there is anything

MR. NORDHAUS;

I think the inconsistency lies in

6 the facts of the previous cases.
7

QUESTION;

But not in the language.

You would

8 con cede that.
9

MR. NORDHAUS;

Not necessarily in the language,

10 but the facts of the earlier cases and of the later cases
11 surely lead to the conclusion that the tax was not based on
12 the power to exclude because the tax was imposed on people
13 who already had property rights on the reservation.
14

QUESTION:

And yet you would tie to the territory.

I would tie it to some extent to

But before I finish, Mr. Claiborne is going to

20 discuss the effect of the 1927 Act, which the Petitioners
21 say grant to the states an exclusive right to tax, but I
22 would like to address for a moment the commerce clause
23 argument.
24

We submit -QUESTION;

Let me ask you this.

How much a

25 necessity for government was there in the Puyallup

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 reservation, which by the time the cases came here that were
2 written in the seventies consisted of a freeway from Tacoma
3 to Seattle?
4

MR. NORDHAUS*

I think in some cases the necessity

5 for a strong government is not clear, but I think in the
6 case of this tribe, and for instance, the Navajo Tribe, the
7 case for a strong tribal government is -- it can't be
8 denied.

The Navajo reservation covers almost 19,000 square

9 miles, bigger than eight of the states.

It covers -- it

10 extends beyond the borders of three different states.

I

11 would venture that the state of Arizona would not -- would
12 be very unhappy if Arizona had to attempt to govern the
13 Navajo reservation.

The Navajo reservation has a

14 tremdendous budget, and a tremendous governmental
15 structure.

It couldn't be --

16

3UESTI0N;

And a tremendous income from oil.

17

MR. NORDHAUSi

Well, but that, of course, there is

18 a great deal of poverty, too. Your Honor, and that income
19 from oil is the property of the landlords rather than a
20 governmental revenue.

But on the commerce clause arguments,

21 Your Honor, we submit that this tax is no different from any
22 other severance tax.

It is a privileged tax on a local

23 activity of producing oil and gas, and it is measured by the
24 volume of production at the wellhead.

All production is

25 sold at the wellhead except pipeline production.

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The Petitioners attack the provision or

1

that

2 the tax rate is applied to oil and gas sold or transported
3 off the reservation.

That means that the tax rate is

4 applied to gas sold on the reservation or transported off
5 the reservation without sale by a pipeline producer.

The

6 purpose of that particular clause, transported off the
7 reservation, is to reach pipeline production which is not
8 sold actually until -- for interstate gas until it reaches
9 the California border and it is sold to Pacific Light and
10 Electric Company.
11

The key to the interpretation of the tax and to

12 the -- and to answer the argument that it is discriminatory
13 against off reservation commerce is that the exemption
14 applies only to royalty gas or condensate taken by the tribe
15 and used by the tribe, meaning the tribal government.

In

16 fact, gas and oil transported off the reservation for
17 processing and returned for consumption by tribal members is
18 taxed.

There is no claim by Petitioners that the tribal tax

19 favors New

20 consumers.

Mexico consumers as opposed to out of state
The claim is that it favors off-reservation

21 consumers, and there we get into an Indian commerce clause
22 claim which has really no reference to discrimination
23 against interstate commerce.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. CLAIBORNE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5 please the Court, it need not be necessary to rebut what is
6 at the end of the day the allegation of the Petitioners,
7 that is to say, that this Court in several of its recent
8 decisions was grossly misusing language or engaged in loose
9 talk when it spoke of inherent tribal sovereignty, when it
10 spoke of residual tribal sovereignty, and specifically
11 sovereignty over its territory, that those words, first
12 declared in the unanimous decision of the Court in the
13 Missouri case.
14

By that, the Court surely did not mean the sort of

15 power that a country club has over its members, to determine
16 membership,

to assess fees against the members, to enact

17 rules of conduct, discipline the members -18

1 the tribe, or it could be read to save — to grant an
2 exemption from even such governmental regulation.
3 Fortunately, we do not have that problem with respect to
4 this case.

Here, the tribe is clearly exerting a

5 governmental power which was in existence at the time these
6 lessees obtained their interest.
7

They may not have appreciated that it would be

8 exercised against them, but that is precisely the situation
9 of the New York Transit case, reported in 303 US.

The City

10 of New York there sought to impose 20 years later on the
11 lessees of rapid transit a tax, and the lessees said, when
12 we obtained our lease you hadn't been granted this power by
13 the state of New York, and certainly we thought we had
14 contracted against it.

This Court held unanimously not so.

This was a

17 expressly provide against its later imposition.
18 Accordingly, the city was entitled to impose that tax,
19 however unanticipated it may have been by the lessee at the
20 time of the contract.

QUESTION;

in deciding Williams versus Lee,

20 the seminal modern case on the subject of Indian
21 sovereignty, involving the Navajo reservation in Arizona,
22 took no exception to the proposition that because this was
23 former territory of Mexico, somehow the Navajos had lost the
24 sovereignty which other tribes throughout the nation

25 enjoyed, and there Mr. Lee was required to submit himself to

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 tribal authority, and of course, the United States entered
2 into a treaty with the Navajos, thereby recognizing them as
3 a sovereign entity.
4

I should stress, because it has been passed by,

5 that the power to tax was, of course, recognized in the
6 Colville case, and with respect to the Colville Indians,
7 whose reservation is not derived from the Treaty of Point
8 Elliott, but is simply an Executive Order reservation of no
9 greater status than the Jicarilla reservation here, nor was
10 that power to tax in any way related to the power to exclude
11 those who bought cigarettes from the reservation.

Many of

12 them lived and were entitled to remain within that
13 reserva tion.
14

Now, I should say something about what I thought

15 to be the only question in the case, which was whether
16 Congress in

1927 took away the inherent power which up to

17 that date the tribe clearly enjoyed to tax non-Indians
18 within these circumstances, within this territory.
19 there is nothing on the face of the

There is nothing arguably

21 inconsistent about granting the power of taxation to the
22 state, and leaving in existence a concurrent power in the
23 tribe.
24

The Colville case teaches us that such two taxing

25 powers may indeed coexist.

There is no inconsistency in a

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 provision which allows the same sovereign to both share in
2 the royalties and to enjoy taxing power.

The 1920 Act,

3 General Leasing Act, with respect to federal lands, does
4 precisely that with respect to the states, who may impose
5 severance taxes and enjoy 50 percent of the federal
6 royalties.
7

QUESTION:

Well, tell me, Mr. Claiborne, is there

8 anything in the way of Congressional action that supports
9 the Secretary’s approval of this tax in this case?
10

MR. CLAIBORNE:

As Justice O'Connor pointed out,

11 the IRA requires the Secretary to approve tribal
12 constitutions.

In. submitting those -- in making his

13 conditions upon the constitutions which he will approve, it
14 appears at the time, judging from the uniform provisions in
15 them, that one of those provisions was that any taxing
16 ordinance bearing on non-Indians should be submitted to him
17 before it was implemented.
18

So it was here.

Accordingly, we have Congress requiring

19 secretarial approval of tribal constitutions, that

20 constitution requiring Secretarial approval of any taxing
21 ordinance bearing on non-Indians, and finally. Secretarial
22 approval in this case of the very ordinance.

That is the

23 common pattern, and it -24

QUESTION:

Well, does that negative any argument

25 that the 1927 Act in any way prevented what happened here?

4 1

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Me don't say that Congress has in

2 1934 clarified any doubt that existed in 1927, because we
3 say that in 1927, at the end of the day, Congress did a very
4 simple thing.

It said, here are these Executive Order

5 reservations with respect to which oil and gas leasing is
6 not presently available.

They thought of several schemes,

7 all of which schemes permitted the state to tax the lessee's
8 interest.

They wanted to give the state something more, a

9 share of the royalties or a power to tax the royalty
10 interest, the Indian interest.
11

They finally realized that here was a model ready

12 made, the 1924 Act, which provided with respect to treaty
13 reservations that the state might tax the whole of the
14 production,
15 royalty.

and the Indians would get the whole of the

In the end, that is precisely the pattern that was

16 followed.
17

It follows that the 1927 Act no more than the 1924

18 Act was focusing in the slightest on Indian taxing power,
19 not a very

lively notion in that day, for historic reasons

20 which we elaborate in our brief.
21

QUESTION;

If the Secretary had declined to

22 approve, what would be the status of this taxing power?
23

WR. CLAIBORNE:

In this case, it would plainly be

24 impermissible for the tribe to implement it since its own
25 constitution requires Secretarial approval for such

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 ordinances
2

QUESTIONS

But that would be by virtue of an

3 inhibition which it had placed on itself in its
4 constitution, would it not?
5

MR. CLAIBORNE:

But which may have been, Mr.

Chief

6 Justice, imposed upon it in order to win approval for its
7 constitution.

At all events, I would suggest that there

8 remains residual power in the Secretary under Section 2 of
9 Title XXV, Section 9, to disapprove, and certainly to refuse
10 to implement any ordinance enacted by a tribe which bears on
11 others than members, and which he has not approved and would
12 affirmatively disapprove, that that residual power could be
13 exercised in any such case.
14

There was, of course, no occasion to do so here,

15 the Secretary believing that the tribe was correctly
16 exercising a power which Congress had not expressly granted
17 it, but which Congress had not taken away.
18

Finally, on the 1927 Act, let me point out the

19 irony of the argument of the Petitioners.

This is

20 legislation expressly designed to aid the tribe which under
21 the Secretary of the Interior’s action in 1922 was getting
22 no part of the royalties from the oil and gas leasing.
23 Congress sought to remedy that by granting Executive Order
24 tribes exactly the same benefits from their lands as treaty
25 tribes.

43

It would be strange to read into such legislation

2 against all the canons of constrution an implied by wholly
3 silent repeat of tribal power.

I submit, Your Honor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JASON W. KELLAHIN, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

9

MR. KELLAHIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court, there are several questions that have been
11 raised here in the argument which I would like to address
12 very briefly.
13
1

The question directed by Justice Stevens, for

14 exa mple, was, did the power to tax exist be fore the creation
15 of the Jicarilla reservation, a nd Mr. Claib orne has said in
16 his opinion it did not, because it is terri torial,

and I

17 think he is exactly right there.
18

QUESTION:

You mean the power to tax non-Indians?

19

MR. KELLAHIN:

20

QUESTION:

Non-Indians.

Yes,

sir.

They had the power to tax their own,

21 whether they -22

MR. KELLAHIN:

23 could have imposed such a tax.

The -- If the power to impose a tax or if the
