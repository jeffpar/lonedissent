MR. CHILIVIS;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
This case is here on writ of certiorari to the
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.

The general questions

10

presented are;

11

1014 of Title XVIII of the United States Code intended

12

to proscribe the deposit of a bad check or "check

13

kiting," and whether a non-collected check upon which

14

the bank extends credit and

15

obligation an be alleged in an indictment as a false

16

statement underpinning the overvaluation of a security

17

under Section 1014.

indictment and Mr. Williams, the Petitioner, was

QUESTIONS

All three counts were under 1014?

MR. CHILIVIS;

4

QUESTIONS

5

MR. CHILIVIS:

6

Now, in this case the Court has limited the

7

consideration on certiorari to two counts, counts two

8

and three.

9

consider what counts two and three were.

Two counts.

Two counts.
Yes, sir.

But I think, it's significant that we
Count two was

10

the overvaluation of "a security, a check," of $56,500

11

which was deposited, drawn on the Winn State Bank and

12

deposited in the Pelican State Bank.

QUESTION:

At a time when there were no funds

to support it?
MR. CHILIVISs

At a time when there were

insufficient funds to support it, yes, sir.

17

And the Government --

QUESTION:

20

21

22

That would have something to do

with its value, wouldn't it?
MR. CHILIVIS:

Yes, sir.

did not have funds to support it, yes, sir.
Now, that check did clear the bank in the

23

normal course of things.

24

paid, and it never came back.

25

It was a check that

It was not dishonored* it was

The other check was a $60,000 check drawn on

State Bank,

check too was paid by the bank and was not returned for

4

insufficient funis, although at the time it was

5

deposited there were not funds in the bank sufficient to

6

cover it.

and that covered the first check.

That

Sow, the Pelican State Bank, which was where

7
8

it all started, had the choice in that instance of

9

bouncing the check or extending credit on the check,

10

which resulted in an overdraft.

It chose to extend

Now, when this transaction started Williams

12

13

had an overdraft at the Pelican State Bank.

14

the Court to bear in mind that this started off with an

15

overdraft at the Pelican State Bank on Hay the 9th of

16

something over $53,000.

17

Hay the 11th, two days later, with an overdraft at the

18

Pelican State Bank of something less than $60,000.

The whole transaction ended on

So check was dishonored.

19

Now, we ask

No check was

20

bounced.

And it was two separate checks.

Now, we

21

mention that because we raised this issue in the Court

22

of Appeals, that is the sufficiency of the indictment

23

under Section 1014.

24

dismissed that by saying that the argument was without

25

merit, because the two transactions at the two banks

constitute classical check kiting, and unde r Payne,

2

which was a Fifth Ci rcuit case, th is check kiting falls

3

within the scope of Section 1014.

4

Now, that' s significant because t hey used both

5

counts of the indict men t to create the cone ept of check

Kiting.

7

cannot do that.

8

you cannot say that if both counts constitu te an offense

then one can be used in the other count uni ess it's

In this case it

Now, the argument in this case ou ght to be

12

then.

In its simplest terms, no cr ime was

13

sim pie,

14

all eged in the indictment under counts two and three and

15

no crime was proved within Section 1014.

16

case has become complicated.

17

because the Government contends that a chec k is a

18

security, a security under Section 101^.

H owever, the

It’s become c omplicated

Now, I remind the Court of the la nguage of

19

1014.

It says:

"Whoever makes a f alse

statement or report, or whoever overvalues land ,

22

property or security for the purpose of inf luencing a

23

federally insured bank to extend credit or make

24

advances," and so on and so forth.

25

"security," not "a security."

It uses the word

check is a security and therefore this constituted the

overvaluation of a security.
QUESTIONS

But this says "land, property or other

have to look just at "security" in view of the broader

term of "property."

MR. CHILIVIS:

QUESTION;

That’s correct.

So I mean,

the only property it's

talking about is property that’s security.

That’s correct.

I don't think it does say "other

covered if they ace pledged as security.

talking about security in the sense of collateral, and

9

this was not that.

10

11
12
13

QUESTION:

You say whatever — you say that it

should be read as meaning "other security."
MR. CHILIVIS:

Yes, sir.

And security in the

sense of collateral.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. CHILIVIS:

16

QUESTION:

17

Eut they're

Yes.
Yes, sir.

And you think the legislative

history helps you on that?

18

MR. CHILIVIS:

19

QUESTION:

Oh, yes, sir.

Yes, sir.

Why do you think it would help you

20

if it read "other security" rather than just

21

"security"?

22

MR. CHILIVIS:

Kell, I think that it's

23

security in the sense of collateral.

I think you may

24

apply the doctrine of eiusdem generis and say that it

25

relates back to the type of security that land or

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AYE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

property is.

But I really say that it talks about

2

security in the sense of collateral, not a security in

3

the sense of a stock or a bond used for something other

4

than collateral.

5

The Government's position is —

6

QUESTION;

You mean this wouldn't -- if you

7

were going to a bank for a loan and they made you fill

8

out a loan application and they wanted to know what your

9

assets were, and you fill it out and you overvalued the

10

property that you own by about ten tim.es.

11

MR. CHILIVIS:

12

QUESTIONi

Yes, sir.

And many times banks don't take

13

security on all of your property.

14

know how much property you got.
MR. CHILIVIS;

15
16

That's correct, sir.

That

would be a violation.
QUESTION;

17
18

They just want to

Well, then it doesn’t mean

collateral.
MR. CHILIVIS;

19

No, sir, because there’re are

20

two elements of it.

One of them says "whoever shall

21

knowingly makes a false report or statement," "a false

22

statement or report."

23

QUESTION t

24

MR. CHILIVISi

25

Yes.
Now, that’s what you're talking

about.

2

Yes, but it's not just about

collateral.
MR. CHILIVIS:

3

Well, but it’s about if you

4

overvalued security in that sense, that's correct, it's

5

not about collateral.
QUESTIONS

6

No, so that you wouldn't -- so that

7

section isn't limited to property that’s collateral.

8

It's limited — it just says "property," if overvaluing

9

that property might influence a bank decision.
MR. CHILIVIS:

10
11

W 11, that's true.

That's

true.
QUESTION:

12

Well, must not the statute be read

13

by having the word "any" m dify all the terms that

14

follow, that is, "any land " "any property,” or "any

15

security"?
MR. CHILIVIS:

16
17

way, sir.

QUESTION:

MR. CHILIVIS:

or not.

guess.
QUESTION:

I don't know whether you could

Well, is this check "any

property"?
MR. CHILIVIS:

24
25

Could you read it any other way?

You could read it the way it's written, I

I think you could read it that

QUESTION:

7

What if the bank practice, though,

8

is to immediately credit the account, which was true in

9

this case?

If you can immediately draw on that credit

10

and if it turns out that the check isn’t collected, the

11

bank can sue you.

12

HR. CHILIVIS:

13

QUESTION;

That’s correct.

Well, you certainly are extending

14

-- you certainly are getting credit from the bank if the

15

bank gives you — lets you use that money without ever

16

having collected the check.
MR. CHILIVIS;

But you have two things that

21

It’s not an extension of credit.

22

That’s been held by one of the

But if you say that they draw on that, that

23

24

25

doesn't, and in order to reach that result in this case

But we submit. Your Honor, that it

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

it requires such convoluted reasoning that it does not

2

give a person any warning that under this statute they

3

are violating a criminal law.
And we say that -- now, we didn't raise the

4
5

constitutional question of impermissible vagueness, but

6

that's what the principle is about.
QUESTION;

7

Well, long before you get to a

8

constitutional principle of impermissible vagueness, you

9

get to some sort of a principle of leniency in statutory

10

construction.
HE. CHILIVISi

11

That's correct. Your Honor.

12

And one of the — you ask about the legislative

13

history.

14

This statute up until 1970 did not include any

15

institution that could accept checks from private

16

customers for deposit.

17

passed a law adding certain federally insured banks and

18

federal savings and loan institutions.

19

nothing that did anything but that.

20

did .

21

Let me address that question by stating this.

In

1970 the Congress merely

There was

That's all they

Now, at the same time this Congress amended a

22

bad check law in the District of Columbia.

That bad

23

check law covers the conduct that the Government says

24

ought to be covered here.

25

words "check, draft or other instrument" used at a bank,

In that law they use the

12

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

or that sort of thing.

2

were talking about.

They made it clear what they

Now, it seems to me that if Congress had

3
4

intended to include a check or a draft under this

5

statute, all they had to do was what they did when they

6

amended the District of Columbia Act.
QUESTION:

7

8

Well, why do you concede, then,

that a check is property —

9

HR. CHILIVIS i

10

QUESTION;

11

MR. CHILIVIS;

12

-- for purpose of the statute?
A check is property, but not in

the terms of the statute.
QUESTION;

3
4

Well, a check —

So you don’t concede a check is

property?
MR. CHILIVIS;

5

Oh, no, sir.

I say a check is

6

property.

7

tender to a bank several checks and say, hold this for a

8

loan, when I get an extension, when I borrow money from

9

the bank, it can be security.

20

A check can even be security, because if I

But in the terms of this statute and this

21

situation, it is not.

And the statute was never

22

intended to include that.

23

"land, property or security"?

24

they said in the same year, 1970, when they passed the

25

last amendment to this Act, when they added banks and

If they did, why did they say
Why didn’t they say what

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

federal savings and Loan institutions?

2

say "check" instead of "land, property or security"?

Why didn't they

We think that's part of the legislative

3
4

intent.

several situations where we quote from the House Banking

6

and Currency Committee when they say it's intended to

7

cover a borrower.

and says it simply adds institutions that are covered

QUESTION*

11

But if you go to a bank and present

12

a check drawn on another bank and ask for cash and the

13

hank gives you cash without having collected the check,

14

and you know very well that the check isn't any good, do

Have you been extended credit?

MR. CHILIVIS:

Well, not under the terms of

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

this statute.

2

don’t want to dodge the question.

3

when you present a check to a bank for deposit you

4

engage that you will, upon notice of dishonor, make that

5

check good.

Let me explain it this way, because I

That’s what you engage.

QUESTION:

6

Under Louisiana law,

Like if you give me the cash or

7

give me the credit, you can treat this check as a note,

8

and I promise to pay.
MS. CHILIVIS;

9

It's in the form of a note,

10

yes, sir.

11

you engage that, and that’s the only representation you

12

make, unless you orally or in writing make some other

13

representation.

14
15
16

It’s in the form of a note.

QUESTION:

And what you do,

I promise to pay for this, pay you

back for this extension of money or credit?
MR. CHILIVIS:

That's right.

You are getting

17

it on an uncollected check.

18

the check is dishonored and the bank protests and gives

19

you notice of dishonor.

20

QUESTION:

You promise to pay only if

Well, is this really any different

21

if you go to the bank and say, please loan me $500, an(j

22

they say, fine, sign this check, sign this note, and you

23

sign the note?

HR. CHILIVIS:

Yes, sir, because in that

instance it is a commercial transaction where you are

It should be even worse, because

This was an overdraft.

Let me put this hypothetical to

10

particular bank, good standing in the community, so he's

13

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

He goes to the bank and hands them

14

a $50,000 check on a nonexistent bank, and the signature

is forged.

MR. CHILIVISs

MR. CHILIVISs

22
23

Has he violated this

No, sir, I don't believe he

has .

24

QUESTION;

You don't think so?

25

MR. CHILIVISs

Not this statute, no, sir.

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

Whether he has violated all 50 states' bad check laws,

2

which is another thing that's involved in the history

3

and rule of lenity, and that is that all 50 states in

4

1970 hai bad check laws that covered that conduct and

5

this has historically and traditionally been the subject

6

of state regulation.

7

make such broad inroads and intrusions into state law,

8

then certainly it should have said something to let

9

people know that that’s what it was doing.
QUESTION:

10

And if Congress had intended to

I wonder

11

if the statute requires that credit be extended pursuant

12

to a false application.

went into a bank and said,

SR. CHILIVIS :

QUESTION;

I know it is.

But in going to that section, that

part of it that my Brother Stevens rust referred to,

what’s "deferment of action or otherwise"?

broadest possible, isn’t it?

to embrace almost anything.

where the man had gotten an erroneous credit of $193,000

But it certainly cannot co ver a bad check,
QUESTION;

But when you put a check into a

22

bank, do you not, in the words of the statute, influence

23

the bank to extend you the credit that goes with that?

24
25

HR. CHILIVIS;
two reasons:

No, sir, I do n’t think so, for

Number one is, when you put the check in

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the bank you are not making a statement other than what

2

the law says you’re making, and that is that you will

3

pay the check in the event it is dishonored and you have

4

notice of dishonor.

5

All right, that's number one.

Number two, it is not security for anything.

6

It is not security for anything.

Now, admittedly under

7

Louisiana law they have a lien on an uncollected item

8

until such time as they send it out for purposes other

9

than collection or until such time as it's collected.

10

But again, if you have to take the Uniform

11

Commercial Code or if you have to take the Louisiana

12

Revised Statutes and compare them and then say that

13

because they have a lien at some time for some period on

14

uncollected items, then that fits into security or the

15

influencing of a loan in this case, then that’s too

16

convoluted to come under a statute which talks about

17

land, property or security for the extension of credit.

18

And that’s one of the points we're making.

1

something very important here?
MR. CHILIVISi

2

It's influenced them to issue

3

money on an uncollected item.

4

QUESTION:

5

It has done something.

You say that's not a violation of

the statute?
MR. CHILIVIS:

6

No, sir, it's not a violation.

7

It's a violation of a state statute, and if they can

8

prove intent to defraud it may even come under other

9

statutes.

10

Of course, you'd have to use the wire or the

mails to do that.
But this statute is sort of a strict liability

11
12

statute.

You don’t have to prove that they intended to

13

defraud, and the Government takes the position that the

14

mere giving of a check that at the time it's presented

15

to the bank does not have sufficient funds to cover it

16

if he's given immediate credit on it constitutes a

17

violation.

18

I suggest to Your Honors --

19

QUESTION:

20

And if he knows that it won’t be --

that's it's an overdraft.

21

HR. CHILIVIS;

22

QUESTION;

23

HR. CHILIVIS:

No, sir.

No, sir.

Well, surely the "willfully" —
No, sir.

No, sir.

He says

24

"knowingly,” knowing that at the time it's presented for

25

deposit that there aren't sufficient funds to cover it.

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, that doesn’t mean that he doesn’t have a reasonable

2

expectation to cover it when it's presented, and I was

3

just about to say that I submit that everybody has done

4

that, deposited a check in the bank and covered it the

5

next day at the receiving bank, the drawee bank.
But that's what is contended to be a crime,

6
7

and you don’t even have to prove, under the Government's

8

contention, that there was an intent to defraud, because

9

this statute does not embrace the intent to defraud.

10

Now, the deposit, in response to Mr. Chief

11

Justice's question, if you take that just a little bit

12

further and you make that a certified check that is

13

known to be false, then I think you could have a

14

violation of this statute.

QUESTION;

Now, the reason for that is

What's the difference?

What's the

17

difference, except the one is more impressive than the

18

other?

19

MR. CKILIVIS;

No, sir.

The difference is

20

what the legal representation is.

As I said before,

21

when you have a check uncertified the legal

22

representation under Louisiana law is that you will

23

honor it on notice of dishonor.

Okay.

24

Now, if it's a check drawn on a bank and it’s

25

certified, then the representation is that the bank has

the funds already on hand to cover that check and that

it will be honored.

QUESTION:

If you —

SR. CHILIVIS:

the representation you make by the mere presentation of

the check.

have male a false representation.

9

And if you know that to be false, then you

QUESTION:

Well, you made a false

10

representation -- I realize that a certified check may

11

be different in that respect.

12

that a check was not either land, property or security,

13

and therefore I don’t see why that element of the

14

offense would be proved any more by a certified check

15

than by a personal check.

16
17
18
19

20

MR. CHILIVIS:

But I thought you said

Well, I don't think it is

property, land or security.
QUESTION:

Well, why do you concede that a

certified check might violate the statute?
SR. CHILIVIS:

Well, it depends.

If you got

21

immediate credit, it might violate the other portion of

22

the statute, Your Honors, the false statement for the

23

purpose of influencing the extension of credit.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. WILKINS, FSQ.

22

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

23

25

MR. WILKINS:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
This case presents a straightforward question

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

of statutory construction.

2

Petitioner’s deceptive check-writing conduct falls

3

within the reach of the federal statute that

4

specifically proscribes the making of intentional

5

misrepresentations for the purpose of influencing the

6

credit decisions of a federally insured bank.

7

QUESTION;

That question is whether

Mr. Wilkins, before you get into

8

that, is he not correct that the indictment is confined

9

to the willfully overvaluing portion of the alternatives

10
11

MR. WILKINS;

12

QUESTION;

13
14

No, Your Honor.

-- so that the intentional false

statement is not quoted in the indictment?
MR. WILKINS;

Counts two and three of the

15

indictment charge Petitioner with knowingly and

16

willfully overvaluing a security.

17

QUESTION;

Correct.

18

MR. WILKINS;

It also contains a

19

representation that he presented the checks and caused

20

to be represented to said bank that said check was of a

21

value equal to the face amount of the check, when in

22

truth and fact this Defendant then well know that there

23

were no sufficient funds.

24

QUESTION;

What are you reading from?

25

MR. WILKINS;

That's from page 3 of the Joint

Even if you prove he made a false

statement, could you convict him under count two?
MR. WILKINS;

The jury in this case,

Your Honor, was instructed that a check is a security

25

within the meaning of Section 1014 as a matter of law.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The only question put to the jury under the instructions

2

of the trial court was whether or not that check or that

security was overvalued.

4

concedes in his reply brief, the question of

overvaluation and false statement in the context of this

case are the same.
QUESTIONS

statute.

23

that a check is not a security --

QUESTION;

But you charged that it was a

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

SR. WILKINS;

Exactly.

But sven assuming that

2

as a matter of law, as a legal theory, it's not a

3

security, the only factual conclusion reached at the

4

trial below was that it was overvalued.

5

QUESTION;

That's because the judge took away

6

from the jury the question of whether it was a security

7

or not, by charging them, under Justice White's

8

hypothesis erroneously, that the check was a security.

9

MR. WILKINS;

But even if that is erroneous,

10

the fact still remains that Petitioner was properly

convicted --

MR. WILKINS;

17

QUESTION;

18

MR. WILKINS;

Of making a false statement.

About what?
The false statement is that he

would have had money, that the checks were represented

of collection, when in fact such was not the case.

22

QUESTION;

That's not what the indictment

So that all that -- in order to

make out the offense under your theory, as I understand

it, is you make a deposit with a check that you know

does not have enough funds in the drawee bank at the

time of the deposit.
MR. WILKINS;

10

For the purpose of influencing a

11

Well*, for the purpose of getting a

better bank account that you can draw against.

13

all you allege here.

14

allege that the balance in the account was therefore

that in count two.

19

In count two all you really do is

You don't allege an actual drawing against

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

that each check was presented for the bank to obtain

MR. WILKINS:

QUESTION:

5

SR. WILKINS:

Exactly.

And you never get to overvaluing.
Right.

It is unnecessary to get

6

to the overvaluation of security to sustain Petitioner's

7

conviction.
Petitioner contends that a check cannot be a

8
9

10

false statement because it is simply a promise to pay a
sum certain upon presentment and notice of dishonor.
QUESTION:

11

Well, but if your theory is right,

12

why isn't any deposit of an insufficient funds check

13

within the statute?
MR. WILKINS:

14

Because, Your Honor, this

15

statute only reaches the deposit or making of knowingly

16

false statements for the purpose of influencing a bank

17

upon a loan, advance or commitment.

18

Section 1014 to reach this conduct does not sweep all

19

bad check prosecutions throughout the United States.

to bad checks that are given to the neighborhood

A check -- the alternative ground for

that a check constitutes overvalued land, property or

term "security" as it has been generally defined

throughout Title 18 of the United States Code includes

any item that stands for some other thing of value.
QUESTION;

5

Okay.

Now, you say that it's been

generally defined that way throughout the United States

-- Title 18 of the United States Code.

MR. WILKINS;

QUESTION:

is quite the contrary, that if Congress has taken

MR. WILKINS;

Of course, this is just an

alternative argument.
MR. WILKINS;

Exactly.

It's just an

14

alternative argument and this Court need not agree that

15

a check is a security to affirm Petitioner's

16

conviction.

17

Petitioner spends considerable effort

18

detailing in his brief the legislative history of

19

Section 1014, but he has been unable to demonstrate a

20

clearly expressed legislative intent to exclude his

21

conduct from the reach of the statute.

argues from sparse legislative history --

QUESTION;

Petitioner

Well, do you feel it's the burden

MR. WILKINSi

2

It is the burden of the

3

Government, of course. Your Honor, to show that he is

4

covered.

the burden

6

this Court has often stated that where you have clear

7

language, in the absence of a clearly expressed

8

legislative intent to the contrary, the statute will be

9

given its clear plain meaning.

But there would be a presumption, I assume,
in the face of clear statutory language —

The fact that there is no express mention of

10
11

Petitioner's conduct in the legislative debates of

12

Section 1014 is of course irrelevant.

i

As this Court

3

stated in Barr v. United States, "If Congress has made a

4

choice of language that fairly brings a given situation

15

within a statute, it is unimportant that a particular

16

application might not have been contemplated by the

17

legislators . "

The conclusion that Section 1014 extends to
the presentation of all knowingly worthless checks that

are presented for the purpose of influencing a credit

2

decision of a federally insured bank —
QUESTION:

3
4

Not knowingly worthless, knowingly

overvalued.

5

SR. WILKINS:

6

QUESTION:

Knowingly overvalued.

It could be ten cents over, I

7

suppose, and still -- I mean, if the amount in the other

8

account is only a couple of dollars below the amount of

9

the check, you’d still have a violation.

10

MR. WILKINS:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. WILKINS:

13

QUESTION:

14

If it is --

It doesn’t have to be worthless.
Well, if it is done knowingly.

Right.

You have to know what your

balance is.
MR. WILKINS:

15

Exactly.

You have to know, Your

16

Honor, that the check will not be paid in the due course

17

of collection.

18

the court specifically instructed the jury here that

19

petitioner had to be engaged in conduct where he well

20

knew that the checks would never be paid and he engaged

21

in this solely for the purpose of obtaining time and

22

credit.

23

Plus in the instructions in this case,

The rule of lenity so often invoked by

24

Petitioner applies only where there is a grievous

25

ambiguity in the language or structure of the Act, that

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is entirely lacking on the facts of this case

2

numerous hyper-technical objections to his indictment

3

and the instructions of the trial court, as I've already

4

mentioned, were raised for the first time before this

5

Court and do not rise to the level of plain error

6

requiring reversal of his conviction.

7

And the

Petitioner's final argument is that his

8

conviction must be reversed because a check kiting

9

conviction requires the prosecution to prove an intent

10

to defraud.

11

the Petitioner was not indicted for check kiting.

12

was indicted for making an intentional false statement

3

or willfully overvaluing a security for the purpose of

4

influencing a federally insured bank upon a loan,

5

advance or commitment.

6

The short answer to this contention is that
He

Each count of his indictment clearly sets

7

forth those facts, clearly sets forth those allegations,

8

and is sufficient to sustain a statutory violation.

9

term "check kiting" as used throughout this -- the

The

20

Government's brief and by Petitioner is simply

21

descriptive of Petitioner's conduct.

22

is not whether this conduct requires some specific

23

intent to defraud in order to be culpable, but rather

24

whether Petitioner's conduct that can be described as

25

check kiting falls within the reach of a federal statute

The question here

45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that prohibits intentional misrepresentations for the

2

purpose of influencing the credit decisions of a

3

federally insured bank.

4

As stated in Petition's reply brief, the

5

overall question is whether the allegations of counts

6

two and three are subject to prosecution under Section

7

1014, regardless of how they are labeled.

8

one labels the conduct of Petitioner, it clearly comes

9

within the reach of Section 1014 and states a violation
