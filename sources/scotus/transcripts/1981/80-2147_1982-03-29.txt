ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD F. McGOVERN, JR., ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. McGOVERN*

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

9 please the Court, this is a Title VII disparate impact
10 case dealing with an employee selection process which as
11

a whole had no adverse impact upon the Respondent's

12 protected group, but which contained a component that
13 did.

Now, although eight Respondents are listed in this

14

writ, it concerns really only four, and those are the

15

four black Respondents.

16
17

All the Respondents in 1978 were welfare
eligibility technicians who sought promotion to the rank

18 of welfare eligibility supervisor.
19

This meant

competition and a selection process, the first step of

20 which was the taking of a written examination.
21

Now, the

examination was designed and developed over the

22 preceding year expressly for the selection process by
23

specialists from the Department of Administrative

24

Services Personnel Division working with supervisory

25

personnel in the Department of Income Maintenance, in

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

which agency the Respondents worked.
The exam was given in December, 1978, to 329

2

3 employees of the Department of Income Maintenance, and
4 of that 329, 314 were racially identified, and of that
5 314, 48 were black and 259 were white, and of the 48
6 black,

26 passed the examination, for a pass rate of

7 54.17 percent.

206 white employees passed the

8 examination, for a pass rate of 79.5 percent.

The black

9 pass rate was 68 percent of the white pass rate.
Respondents learned that they had failed this

10
11

examination on or about March 15th, 1979, and as a

12 result they could not continue on in the selection

13 process.

Now, the process continued as follows.

The

14 Personnel Division took all scores of all passing

15 candidates and listed them on a promotion list by order
16 of rank.

Each rank corresponded to a particular score

17 on the examination.

Thus, all persons with the highest

18 score were in the first rank.

All persons with the

19 second highest score were in the second rank.
20
21

QUESTION*

General McGovern, I suppose that

that test, however, was an effective barrier to the

22 further progress of those who failed it.

23

MR. McGOVERNs

That is correct, Mr. Justice.

24

Now, at this point, the — for each vacancy —

25 excuse me — in the — which an appointing authority,

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
\‘K

a

j

1

here the Commissioner of Income Maintenance, had to

2 fill, he was entitled to have certified to him five

3 ranks.

This is called the rule of five.

For additional

4 vacancy which he had at this particular time, he was
5 entitled to an additional rank.
6

He could select

anywhere from among the ranks which were certified to

7 him .
8

Therefore, if there were five vacancies, he

9 could choose any five people from within the nine ranks
10 which had been certified to him.
11
12

Here we have a somewhat unusual situation, and
that is by the time which the promotions were finally

13 made, there were 46 vacancies but only 25 ranks of
14 passing candidates.

Therefore, the appointing authority

15 had the option of selecting from among all candidates
16 who passed the examination, all 25 ranks.

As I say,

17 this is unusual.
18

The appointing authority, in making his

19 selections, considered not only rank on the list but
20 recommendation of superiors and job evaluations.
21

However, before these appointments could be made,

22 Respondents sought an injunction in the district court

23 for the District of Connecticut, and as it pertains to
24 this matter here, the black Respondents claimed that
25 their elimination from the process violated Title VII in

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

that there was a disparate impact upon black candidates

2

at the examination stage by virtue of an examination

3 which they allege to be non-job related.
At this point in time there was a chambers

4

5 conference, shortly after the injunction had been
6

sought.

The Petitioners agreed not to appoint any

7 persons off the list until the case could be heard on
8 the merits.

When nearly a year had passed, and still

9 the case had not been brought to trial, and the
10 exigencies of the department's business necessitated
11

the

making of appointments, the Petitioners informed the

12 court that they intended to make appointments.

The court agreed not to proceed on the

13

14 temporary injunction motion as long as eight positions
15 were saved for the eight respondents pending the outcome
16 of trial.
QUESTION;

17
18 question?

General McGovern, may I ask you a

You may want to think about it over lunch.

19 Supposing the test had different passing scores for
20 blacks and whites, that a black had to get a 75 score
21

and a white could pass with 65, and therefore it was

22 plainly disriminatory, but then

when the whole process

23 was completed, why, there was a fair number of blacks
24 and whites hired, as there are here.

Would you still

25 apply the bottom line approach?

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
,">|W CIC‘./.nrn/p:

ME. McGOVERN;

1

I don’t believe the bottom line

2 would apply in that situation, because there the device
3

would be discriminatory on its face.
QUESTIONs

4

But the argument here is that the

5

test is not job-related, and is discriminatory, so why

6

is that a different case?
MR. McGOVERNs

7

That is a different case

8 because in this situation, it is not foreseeable to the
9 appointing authority that the test is a vehicle of
10

discrimination.

In fact, quite to the contrary —

QUESTION;

11

But your position is that even if

12

it is discriminatory and not job-related, you

13

nevertheless look at the bottom line.
MR. McGOVERN;

14

It is our position that in a

15

test given -- well, maybe — I’ll withdraw that.

16

of all, in the situation which you gave, Justice, there,

17

the device would on its face be discriminatory.

18

another situation, if the test were such —
QUESTION;

20 their allegations in this complaint and said, this is

scores.

Would that be enough?

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. McGovern, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BERNARD F. McGOVERN , JR., ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - CONTINUED

6

MR. McGOVERN;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

I just have one or two more facts I would like

8 to bring to the Court’s attention, and that is, when the

9 selections, the promotions were actually made in this
10

case, there were 46 promotions, and of those 46

11

promotions, eleven black candidates were promoted and 35

12

white candidates were promoted.

The black candidate

13 promotion rate was 23 percent of the original black
14 applicant pool, while the white candidate promotion rate
15 was 13.5 percent of the original white applicant pool.
16

QUESTION;

What did you say about the blacks?

17

MR. McGOVERN;

18

QUESTION;

19

MR. McGOVERN:

The promotion rate —

Yes.
— of black candidates was 23

20 percent of the entire black applicant pool.
21

QUESTION;

Yes.

22

MR. McGOVERN;

23

QUESTION;

Now —

Mr. McGovern, was that the result

24 of an affirmative action program on the part of the
25 state?

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

ME. McGOVERN*

1

Justice O’Connor, the actual

2 promotions were the result of an affirmative action

3 program only to the extent as defined by statute.

That

4 is Section 46-70 of the Connecticut General Statutes,
5 which provides to the effect that promotions shall be
6 made on the basis of merit and qualification, and

7 without regard to race, color, creed, and so forth.
8

The Respondents have suggested —

9

QUESTION;

10

You

said, yes, it was the result of affirmative action.
MR. McGOVERNs

11
12

Hell, what does that mean?

It was a result of state

affirmative action statutes to the extent that race is

13 not considered in making promotions under our state
14 affirmative action laws, and appointing authorities are
15 sensitized to keep the selection process free of
16 discrimination of all types.

Certainly, for the state

17 in this particular proceeding to make appointments at
18 this juncture of the examination process on the basis of
19 race, whether to meet a certain number of for any other
20 reason other than on the basis of merit and
21

qualifications would be a violation of state law, and I

22 dare say it would also be a violation of the Fourteenth

23 Amendment of the United States Constitution and probably
24 Title VII.
25

We are not in a situation here in which there

is a past history of discrimination on the part of the

2 state of Connecticut as an employer.

QUESTION;

3

I remain puzzled by your answer to

4 Justice O’Connor’s question.

As I understand your oral

5 recitation of the Connecticut statute, it simply says,
6

no consideration shall be given to race, creed, sex, et

7 cetera, and yet did you say, or am I mistaken in
3 thinking you said it,

that this was to an extent an

9 affirmative action?
ME. McGOVERN;

10
11

Well, if I confused the issue,

I apologize, Justice Rehnquist.

State affirmative

12 action statutes, Connecticut attempting to be an

13 exemplar in the area and requiring agencies to engage —
14 and equal opportunity is — our affirmative action
15 statutes are basically equal opportunity statutes.

They

16 require state agencies to review their procedures and
17 policies, and to make certain that discrimination,
18 either racially or religiously or otherwise, does not
19 enter into the picture, so that the only affirmative
20

action in the selection process was to the extent that

21 state officials are, shall we say,

sensitized not to

22 allow race to come into play in making a promotion

23 decision.
24

QUESTION;

And I think you told me, did you,

25 Mr. McGovern, that the bottom line was 23 percent of the

QUESTION*

That is correct.

And there is no reflection of any

8

MR. McGOVERNs

He feel certainly there isn't,

10 there is certainly no evidence that we did in this
11 particular case.

12

QUESTION:

While I have you interrupted, Mr.

13 McGovern, may I ask you. Section 2(A)(2), the section I
14 guess we have involved here for construction, provides
15 that it is an unlawful employment practice to classify
16 applicants in any way which would deprive or tend to
17 deprive.

Is the issue here whether this examination

18 effects a classification in violation of thatprovision
19

HR. McGOVERNs We contend that any

20 classification is in the actual employment decisions.
21

QUESTIONS

And not at this stage?

22

MR. McGOVERNs Not at this stage, that

here

23 there is no evidence —
24

QUESTION:

Well, it does say, doesn't it, to

25 classify applicants in any way.

It is a prohibition

7

-QUESTION;

Well, then, your answer to me is

8 that 2 is not at all relevant to

the decision in this

9 case?
10

MR. McGOVERN:

It is our position that if

11 there is discrimination, it is under Section 1.
12

QUESTION;

I thought you conceded to Justice

13 Stevens that if they had one test applicable to blacks
14 and one to whites, that that in itself would be the end
15 of the matter.
16

MR. McGOVERN:

Well, that would be because

17 there would be —
18

QUESTION:

That would be because there would

19 be a racial classification.
20

MR. McGOVERN:

Which would end up ultimately

21 in discrimination with respect to hiring or promotion.
22

QUESTION:

Well, that may be.

You still say

23 that the passage that Justice Brennan read to you would
24 not be relevant?
25

MR. McGOVERN;

I would say it would not be th

1 basis of a violation in this case, Hr. Justice.
2

QUESTION*

Well, I thought you said to Justice

3 Stevens that even if the bottom line in the example that
4 I gave you was the same as in this case, the express
5 racial classification on the test would be a violation.
6 I thought you answered Justice Stevens that way.
7

MR. McGOVERNi

Well, perhaps it would be in

8 the extent that —
9
10 violate?

QUESTION:

Well, if it would, what would it

What Justice Brennan read to you, or something

11 else?

12

MR. McGOVERN:

In that sense, in that sense

13 the classification would be express and would be
14 intentionally discriminatory.

Here, classification is

15 in the final selection process because there is no

16 intentional discrimination.

In the example which

17 Justice Stevens gave, clearly, to set a passing point of
18 75 for blacks and 65 for whites would be a case of
19 intentional discrimination.

20

QUESTION*

Here, if there is an —

If it were Just the reverse?

If it

21 were just the reverse, what would you say?

22

MR. McGOVERN*

That would be discrimination

23 against whites, Mr. Chief Justice.
24

QUESTION*

Well, did any whites complain when

25 twice as many Negroes were promoted, almost twice as

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

many here?

2

HR. McGOVERN*

3

QUESTION;

Not to my knowledge.

Mr. McGovern, was this case tried

4 on a disparate impact theory, or a disparate treatment
5 theory, would you say?
MR. McGOVERN*

6

Justice O'Connor, it was tried

7 on a disparate impact theory, or perhaps I should
8 qualify it, because the Respondents as plaintiffs in the

9 case did allege disparate treatment with respect to the
10

test.

However, both lower courts found that the

11

approprite rationale for this case, the appropriate

12

model of proof was disparate impact.
QUESTION*

13

Would the example that Justice

14 Stevens gave earlier today fit better under the
15 disparate treatment theor?
MR. McGOVERN;

16

I say it would fit better under

17 the disparate treatment theory, because it is
18 intentional, specific discrimination against the
19 protected group.
QUESTION;

20
21

General McGovern, the complaint

alleges that the defendants knew or should have known

22 that the examination would discriminately exclude black

23 applicants for promotion, so how do you — why is that
24 different than the 65-75?

That is the comment from the

25 complaint.

1 free of racial animus is, where do we measure
2 discrimination, since discrimination is what Title VII
3 is all about.

Do we measure it at each step of a

4 multi-component process, or do we measure it at the
5 so-called bottom line?

It's the Petitioners’ position

6 in a process such as this the focal point should be the
7 end result of the process.
8
9

Here we have a statute.

We are attempting to

peg an evidentiary rule to a statutory prescription.

10 The Court’s focal point therefore should be Congress’s
11

focal point.

In enacting Title VII, we glean from the

12 decsiions of this Court and the legislative history that
13

an overriding concern of Congress in this instance was

14

opening opportunities and skilled positions to blacks

15 and doing away with racial job stratification by
16 eliminating discrimination, not only in intent but in
17

effect, and as this Court in Teamsters pointed out, that

18

it is to be expected that a non-discriminatory

19

environment will result in a work force which mirrors

20 demographically the community.
21

Therefore, Congress was interested in the

22 overall picture.

In addition to dealing with individual

23

instances of specific intentional discrimination,

24

Congress was concerned with whether minorities got

25

skilled jobs in sufficient numbers to penetrate the

It was interested in

Our position is consistent with all relevant

5

Griggs versus

Albemarle — excuse me, Griggs versus Duke Power,

6 Albemarle Paper Company versus Moody, Dothard versus
7 Rawlinson were all bottom line cases in the sense that
8 in each of those cases there was disparate impact at the

9 hiring level.
10

QUESTION;

I beg your pardon?

I say, you will never convince

8 these plaintiffs of that, will you?
9

MR. McGOVERN;

Well, I hope we convince the

10 Court in that respect, but it is our position that in
11 this model of proof the individual's rights are really
12 tied to the group's rights in the sense that in a case
13 such as this, we do not deal with the individual's
14 particular situation other than identifying his
15 protected status, and so we do not know about his
16 education, his background, or any other — how he even
17 came to apply for the job.
13

In this respect, all we know, that if an

19 individual is to succeed in proving a prima facie case
20 of discrimination, that is contingent upon how his group
21 does, and if his group, with respect to the selection
22 process, does not succeed as a group, then he succeeds
23 in proving a prima facie case.

However, if his group

24 does succeed in the extent that there is no disparate
25 impact against the group, then he fails or does not

2 absent intentional discrimination.
3

Now, in Dothard, this Court described Griggs

4

and Albemarle as dealing with facially neutral

5

employment standards which disproportionately exclude

6

blacks from employment, and the Court stated that Griggs

7

and Albemarle guided its decision in that case, but in

8 addition, those cases have elements which are not
9

present in this particular case.

10

In addition to containing disparate impact at

11

both the selection level and the component level, these

12

cases contain another element not present in this case,

13

and that is an element of invidiousness, and the Court

14

pointed out in both Griggs and Dothard that Title VII

15

deals with removal of artificial, unnecessary barriers

16

which operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis

17

of racial or other impermissible classifications.

18
19

Now, in Griggs and Albemarle, the status quo
of past patterns of discrimination was frozen by diploma

20 and test requirements which had a certifiable,
21

foreseeable effect through demographic statistics on the

22 protected groups, and which also in the case of tests
23

excluded members of an educationally deprived group,

24

blacks in North Carolina, which educational deprivation

25

was directly traceable to race due to education in de

In Dothard, the height and weight requirements

the sense that the employer knew or

5 statistics, could have certified such, that the
6 particular component would have an adverse impact on

7 women, and that component was related to gender.

There are no built-in

20 statistics, shown that it would in effect have an

for a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS W. BUCCI, ESQ.,

8
9

Very well.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BUCCI*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10 please the Court, the claim of discrimination by the
11 Respondents in this case is that they were denied a
12 promotional opportunity solely on the basis of the

13 results of an examination that disproportionately
14 excluded black candidates from promotional eligibility.

15

Their claim — the claim rests upon an

16 examination that was held to determine whether
17 individuals were qualified for promotion.

Those

18 candidates who passed the examination entered into a
19 promotional eligibility pool from which the appointing
20 authority in his discretion made final selections.

21 There was no other component that further screened the
22 candidates once entering that eligibility pool.

23

claim made to the district court and the court of

22 appeals of disparate treatment,

in the sense that the

examination — that a passing point was not set for this

24

examination until after it was graded, and then a

25

passing point was selected, when it should have been

evidence, there was all the statistics before the

2

Petitioners to realize that the setting of this passing

3

point would exclude a disproportionate number of black

4

candidates.

5

In fact, there was testimony at the district

6

court that a 70 was the initial passing point that the

7

statistics of the exam would have required, but it was

8 lowered to 65 so as to lower the disparate impact of the
9

examination if the passing point had been set at 70.

10

There is no dispute before this Court,

11

Petitioners do not dispute that this examination

12

disproportionately excluded black, candidates.

13

Court has on various occasions held that a claimant

establishes a violation of Title VII by showing that an

Here we are claiming that we

19 are not being given equal access to a promotional

20 opportunity, and we are being denied that by a facially
21 neutral device which disproportionately excludes members

22 of a protected class.
23

The same rationale applies, and I think the

The state has stated that

I don't think those numbers, the selection of

6 the Respondent's claim, would also be contrary to two
7 fundamental principles of Title VII, the first principle
8 being that the Title VII was enacted to prohibit

9 discrimination against individuals.

Again, Congress

10 chose the means of prohibiting discrimination against

11 individuals.

It selected to eliminate or decided to

12 eliminate selection processes that discriminated in

13 effect unless they were shown to be job-related.
14

Respondents aren't here saying that this

15 examination is illegal•merely because it had a
16 disproportionate impact.

They have made the claim that

17 it was not job-related, related to the job.

All these

18 individuals, these four Respondents in this case, were
19 serving for up to two years provisionally in the
20 positions at question.

They were serving, as fhe

21 testimony at trial indicated, successfully in their
22 positions.

They were eliminated by this test.

It is

23 their claim, and if this Court decides in favor of the

25 whether the exam was job-related or not.

Also the claim is made here that this was one

The

3 EEOC has issued questions and answers as a means to
4 attempt to interpret their guidelines, and in one of
5 their questions, Questions 14, it addresses this bottom
6 line approach, and it defines selection process as all

7 the component selection procedures leading to the final
8 employment decision.

It is the claim of the Respondents in this

9
10

case that there was only one component leading to the

11

final employment decision or promotional decision in

12 this case.

That was the examination.

After the

13 examiation, the commissioner made selections,
14 discretionary selections.

There was no other component

15 that further screened candidates for qualification for
16 promotion.
17

The claim is also made that the bottom line

18 approach satisfies the Congressional purpose of placing
19 more black candidates, black individuals into employment
20 positions, but again, the purpose that this may serve
21

the purpose of Congress as to a group, as to a

22 classification, runs contrary to the idea that Title VII

23 is aimed at the individual, its focus is on the
24 individual, and that that focus on the individual
25 prohibits the treatment of individuals merely as

9

To adopt the position advanced by the

10

Petitioners in this case, this Court would be

11

sanctioning the use of selection or promotional devices

12 that have disproportionate impacts, that do
13

discriminate, and that are not related to business

14

justification, that are not job-related.

15

The touchstone — this Court has said the

16

touchstone of Title VII is business necessity, and that

17

runs throughout the Court’s decisions, that if a

18

selection process or a promotional process excludes

19

disproportionately one member — members of a protected

20 group, then that device has to be shown to be
21

job-related, and that teaching was from Griggs right

22 down to Dothard versus Rawlinson.
23

The Court has addressed the bottom line

24

approach in a number of instances, not explicitly.

In

25

Furnco, the Court did say that the bottom line numbers

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

were relevant as to the question of intent in a

2 disparate treatment case, but in New York Transit
3

Authority versus Beazer, dealing with a disparate impact

4

case, although the Court found a weak prima facie case

5

of discrimination, and found that the employment

6 practice was job related, the Court did not rely on the
7

bottom line numbers in that case as dismissing or saying

8 that there was no prima facie violation of Title VII.

Those statistics showed that the employment by

9
10

the New

York Transit Authority, they employed

11

minorities twice as high as their numbers in the

12

relevant labor market.

13

that that would be relevant to a disparate treatment

14

case where intent was required, where proof of intent

15

was required.

The Court did say in a footnote

16

I think to adopt the position advanced by the

17

Petitioners in this case would bring the Court close to

18

sanctioning in effect a subjective quota system, in that

19

as long as the bottom line numbers, as long as the

20 numbers match up, irregardless of the legitimacy of the
21

devices screening the candidates, then there would be no

22 violation of Title VII.

4 process, and if the appointing authority were required
5 to go down the list, one, two, three, four, five, as the
6 examination results ranked the candidates, then there

7 would be a prima facie case, because the examination
8 would in effect be the selection process.
9

Here, there was an examination.

10 were listed in a particular order.

Candidates

However, the

11 appointing authority was not bound to go down the list,
12 one, two, three, four, five.

He had other selection

13 devices, and in fact employed them in this case.

So

14 that we are not here dealing with a simple component
15 selection device.
16

Further, it was pointed out to the Court that

17 the court of appeals as a general proposition endorsed
18 the bottom line rule, and it said, viewing the overall

19 results of a selection process ordinarily is a prudent
20 course to pursue.

Now, it did draw the line with

21 respect to an identifiable pass-fail barrier and said in
22 that situation a different result would obtain.

23

Under the court of appeals rationale, if all

24 persons in the selection process were allowed to
25 continue until the end of the process, and then the

exact same selections were made as were made in this

2

process, there would be no disparate impact case, no

3

case for the Respondents under any circumstances.

4

However, Furnco and Burdine do not require the employer

5

to use a process which maximizes consideration of

6

minority candidates, nor does it require the best hiring

7

process to be used, and in point of fact, the Court's

8

emphasis on a passing score, some kind of a watershed or

9

great divide is totally illusory, because in this

10

situation particularly, where we have the rule of five,

11

there are many passing points with respect to the

12

selection process, all the way up and down the list.

13

For example, if we had a situation in which a

14

person was in the eleventh rank, and there were but six

15

vacancies, so that the appointing authority was —

16

certified the first ten ranks, if in that situation, a

17

person in the eleventh rank were, say, black, and there

18

were disparate impact from the eleventh rank down,

19

would, under the rationale of the court of appeals,

20 would he be allowed to prove a prima facie case with
21

respect to disparate impact at the eleventh rank,

22 because that to him was a de facto passing score with
23

respect to those particular six jobs, and this could

24

carry up and down the whole process, and we could end up

25

with three or four cases on a particular selection

QUESTION*

Mr. McGovern, the Solicitor General

3

suggests that the burden of proof shifts earlier, once

4

there is an adverse impact shown as to a particular test

5

or portion of the requirements, and that that then

6

shifts the burden to the employer.

comment upon that?

MR. McGOVERN:

Would you like to

Yes, Justice O’Connor.

disagree with that position.

We

Here we are a case of

10

establishing a prima facie case, and in a case of

11

non-intentional discrimination.

12

contention that the plaintiffs in that case have the

13

burden of making a prima facie case, and in a situation

14

such as in this selection process, there is no prima

15

facie case, no showing in any sense of discrimination

16

until such time as the plaintiff showed disparate impact

17

with respect to the final employment decisions.

18

Thank you.
