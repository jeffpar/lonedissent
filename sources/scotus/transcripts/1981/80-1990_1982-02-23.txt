ORAL ARGUMENT OF ELINOR H. STILLMAN
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case is here on Writ of Certiorari to the

11

United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

12

Petitioners seeking reversal of the Court of Appeals

13

judgment are the Secretary of Defense and officers of

14

the Navy and the Marine Corps.

15

This action,

which was brought by the Governor

16

of Puerto Rico and others to enjoin the Navy's use of

17

Vieques Island for weapons training, raised claims under

18

a number of different statutes.

19

review in this Court is simply whether a district court,

20

upon finding a violation of Section 301(a) of the Clean

21

Water Act respecting discharges of ordnances, is

22

required, regardless of circumstances, to enter an order

23

directing the immediate cessation of the activity

24

producing the discharge.

25

But the issue for

The court of appeals read the Act as imposing

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

such a constraint on the court's remedial discretion,

2

and it thus held that the district court lacks

3

discretion to enter a less extreme order requiring the

4

Navy promptly to seek a Rational Pollutant Discharge

5

Elimination System Permit, commonly termed an NPDES

6

permit, for the intermittent discharge of pollutants

7

into the waters of Vieques Island that are part of the

8

principal Naval Weapons Training area for the Atlantic

9

fleet.
Petitioners submit that neither the language

10
11

nor the purposes of this Act require this constraint on

12

a district court's traditional exercise of discretion in

13

shaping equitable relief.

14

holding represents an unprecedented construction of the

15

Clean Water Act, requiring an all-or-nothing approach to

16

enforcement which would preclude any kind of credible

17

enforcement program by EPA or by authorized state

18

agencies.

19

Indeed, the court of appeals'

Before discussing these larger implications of

20

the court of appeals' holding, however, I would first

21

like briefly to summarize some of the factual findings

22

which led the district court to conclude that the order

23

it entered adequately vindicated the interests of the

24

Clean Water Act.

25

The eastern half of Vieques Island is part of

In the course of these exercises, some of the

ordnance misses the land-base targets and drops into

19

waters within the three mile limit of Vieques.

20

terms of the Clean Water Act, this is a discharge of a

21

pollutant from a point source, requiring an NPDES

22

permit. This is so because the definition of pollutants

23

includes munitions, and a point source is any discrete

24

conveyance including vessels.

benefit rather than the detriment of the environment

restrictions on a large area around the area in which

17

the weapons training is carried on, and these

18

restrictions limited the amount of human trespassing

19

that had caused problems for some of the area -- would

20

have caused problems absent these restrictions.

21

And this was so because the Navy had to place

In sum, on the record there appeared to be no

22

violation of any water quality standards or any

23

technology-based standards, and the Navy's lack of an

24

NPPES permit was the only apparent violation of the

25

Clean Water Act.

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

Mrs. Stillman,

I take it that the

2

EPA was prepared to issue a permit, but was unable to do

3

so because Puerto Rico had refused to certify compliance

4

with local water quality standards.

5

that the Navy can challenge Puerto Rico's refusal, or is

6

that going to be a permanent -- ?
MRS. STILLMAN:

7

Is there no way

The Navy can challenge the

8

refusal.

I must say that that is still in litigation at

9

the administrative stage in Puerto Rico.

There is still

10

a motion for reconsideration pending, at least the last

11

time I checked.

12

Environmental Quality Board there will probably issue a

13

decision on that February 26.

14

QUESTION:

15
16

And we understand that the

And if that happened, it would

solve the problem.
MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, if they grant the

17

certification I think the permit probably would issue

18

then because EPA has developed a draft permit under

19

which, I might add, the Navy would be required to

20

monitor water quality and make reports.

21

QUESTION:

And also,

I understand the

22

President could give an exemption from the permit

23

requirement.

24
25

Is that right?

MRS. STILLMAN:

Yes, he could. I was going to

get to this later in my talk, but since you bring it up

14

It has to be done by

And this can be for weapons of the military

Now,

respondents have suggested,

and

15

certainly, the court of appeals seemed to rely on this

16

also, that the existence of this exemption provision

17

somehow meant that the district court was denied

18

discretion to do what it did in the case here.

19

this exemption provision must be the only way that you

20

can ever allow, even for a limited time, any carrying

21

out of military exercises without a permit.

22

We strongly believe this is wrong.

That

Fcr one

23

thing, I think it's got to be understood that the

24

exemption is not the equivalent of what the district

25

court did here.

Under the three-year exemption, the

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (201) 554-2345

1

Navy would not be required to do what it will be

2

required to do under this permit.

3

Under the permit, if it issues, the Navy will

4

be required to monitor, I believe, nine different, they

5

call them parameters, but it's monitoring for things

6

like iron and acidity and so on.

7

QUESTION:

Mrs. Stillman, couldn’t the

8

President take care of that?

9

Navy, we would like you to follow these restrictions?

10
11
12

He would have the authority, I suppose.
MRS. STILLMAN:

QUESTION:

14

the law, I suppose.

16
17

He could, but under the

statute we think, that --

13

15

Couldn't he say to the

Well, he presumably wants to obey

MRS. STILLMAN:

But he could issue the

exemption without disobeying the law.
QUESTION:

He would have the power to grant a

18

total exemption, but do you think it's correct to assume

19

that he would never exercise his discretion in a sort of

20

a discretionary way and say well, I'll grant the

21

exemption but only with these strings attached.

22

MRS. STILLMAN:

No, I don't suggest there are

23

limits on his discretion.

We're simply saying that we

24

think the best accommodation under the best way of

25

accommodating the interests of the Clean Water Act here

is to find a solution where the court doesn’t have to

2

choose between on the one hand saying that national

3

defense efforts will be held up, and on the other hand

4

saying get an exemption, which may not require you to do

5

any thing .
QUESTION;

6

But if you lose in the proceedings

7

going on in Puerto Rico, aren’t you going to be

8

confronted with exactly that choice?
MRS. STILLMAN;

9

Well, that’s right, the Navy

10

would be confronted with that choice, but we think

11

unless —

13

QUESTION;

And then what relief should the

district court give?

14

MRS. STILLMAN;

15

QUESTION;

16
17

Excuse me?

If that happens, then what relief

would be appropriate?
MRS. STILLMAN;

If -- may I say that one of

18

the factors in deciding whether or not to seek an

19

immediate cessation order on the part of the government

20

is whether you think the applicant seeking the permit

21

will ever be able to comply.

The answer would be no, if you lose

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

right.

If you came to some point where it was clear

2

there were no appeal procedures, that they were going to

3

refuse the certification, at that point I think the

4

exemption clearly — we think that that is what the

5

exemption was created for.
These exemptions were not created to be a

routine use; that is, the -QUESTION;

But you've already told us this is

not a routine case, this is a very important military
area .
MRS. STILLMAN;

11

Well, that's true.

set by the EPA than by the Office of Management and

certainly conceivable —

MRS. STILLMAN;

to me, is either to comply with the statute or to get a

MRS. STILLMAN:

2

Well, that’s true at that

point, but we are not at that point in the case, and the

4

district court was not at that point when it issued the

order here.

5

Yes, but if you applied and you

didn't get it, then an injunction would be proper, you

think.

In this case.
MRS. STILLMAN:

8

9

If it were absolutely clear

that no permit — at the very end where it becomes clear

10

that the denial of certification is going to stick and

11

that there is no further recourse, at that point we

12

might say the injunction is proper.

13

there might be provision, an equitable provision for

14

reasonable time to get the exemption issued.

15

want to give up on that.
QUESTION:

16

But even there,

I don't

I suppose if we took this case

17

under advisement and if the average time of getting an

18

opinion out is 50 days, that the case might be moot by

19

that time.

20

MRS. STILLMAN:

I doubt that very much, Your

21

Honor, simply because this opinion that may issue from

22

the Environmental Quality Board on the 26th is not the

23

final word, necessarily.

24

that we can

25

be moot at that point.

We have various appeal routes

There are review provisions

MRS. STILLMAN;

There are a

Even if the Board says yes, you may

have it, how long is it going to take you to get it?
MRS. STILLMAN;

Your Honor,

I don't know

exactly how long these procedures take.
QUESTION;

Should we decide the case, if the

20

Board says yes, you may have a permit but it will take

21

us some time to get it out?

22

MRS.

STILLMAN;

I am advised that it might

23

take 90 days to get the final permit, even after the

24

certification is issued.

25

QUESTION;

Is the certification appealable by,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

say, the Governor who is opposing the whole thing?
MRS. STILLMAN:

2

I suppose the Governor could

3

object to -- I don't think it's a case in which only one

4

side can take an appeal.
I should say that the Environmental Quality

for about 20 years# hasn’t it?

13

MRS.

STILLMAN:

14

QUESTION:

Excuse me?

This whole problem has been going

15

on for about 20 years, trying to get the Navy off of

16

there.
MRS. STILLMAN:

17
18

It has a long history, Your

Honor.

19

QUESTION:

I don't know exactly how many years.

20

MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, the Navy has been there

21

since World War II, and there has been some kind of

22

target practice going on there since I believe at least

23

the late sixties and early seventies, and it started, I

24

think the findings indicated in its present intensity at

25

least, in 1975.

And I might say that a witness from EPA who

2

testified in the trial hearing indicated that EPA had

3

never had any requests from the Environmental Quality

Board in Puerto Rico to find that the shelling activity

5

was a violation of the Clean Water Act.

12

number of grounds and the Clean Water Act was only one

13

part of the case, and that is the part that has come up

here.

And I want to mak e clear that we're concerned

about this case not just be cause of the Navy, although

certainly that's a very str ong interest here.

concerned about the working s of the Clean Water Act as a

If it were really the case that when EPA

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

wanted to take an enforcement action against a

2

discharger of pollutants who is in violation of 301(a)

3

ofthe Act, which covers a number of -- you can be in

4

violation in terms of your permit or not have a permit

5

and so on -- .

6

either we don’t take any action at all or we have -- we

7

go to court, and the only action that can be taken is

8

that they're going to shut down the whole operation, it

9

really would make this Act unworkable, and the Act has

10

If the question they have to face is

never worked that way.

11

This decision of the First Circuit really was

12

quite unprecedented and just simply not consistent with

13

the way the statute has worked.
QUESTION;

14

Is there any power under the

15

statute in the EPA to grant any kind of temporary relief

16

pending the final resolution of these questions?
MRS. STILLMAN;

17
18

administratively?

19

QUESTION;

20

MRS. STILLMAN;

21

24
25

Yes.
Well, EPA can issue

administrative compliance orders -- .
QUESTION;

22
23

On the part of EPA

A temporary permit or anything of

that kind?
MRS. STILLMAN;

Well, the court, by — this

action was in court, so it's really a question of what

ths court was going to do here.
QUESTION:

Right, but I'm asking whether there

is administrative relief available as well.
MRS. STILLMAN:

Well, under Section 309, the

5

Administrator can issue compliance orders, and -- I

6

don't know what you mean by temporary relief.

7

that's what I'm not sure.

8
9

I guess

What we’re trying to suggest is that there are
a whole range of remedial responses, either

10

11

of, for example in some of these consent decrees, having

12

civil penalties for every day that they are not meeting

13

the schedule.

14

But this, of course, comes up in a citizens'

15

suit, and so it is not in the framework of a general

16

enforcement action.

17

QUESTION:

Do you think the framework of the

18

whole statute indicates an intention on the part of

19

Congress to take it out of the realm of the courts, if

20

you will, and have these problems solved

21

administratively, in effect?

22

MRS. STILLMAN:

Your Honor, do I understand --

23

are you touching on the point that respondents made that

somehow the discretion that we want to give the court

that the other side has placed on TVA against Hill and

suggested that this is just a case in which we are

trying to say pay no attention to what Congress did;

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Congress did something very unwise here, and do it this

2

way because we think this is a better way of doing it.
We think TVA v. Hill was a very different

3

case.

In that case, the injunction sought was to enjoin

5

the closing of the gates of Tellico Dam.

6

those gates had been closed , this would have resulted in

7

te destruction of the critical habitat of an endangered

8

species, against the direct prohibition of the statute.

9

And this kind of irreversible and prohibited result was

inconsistent with what Congress seemed clearly to

require.

it would be unavailable in federal enforcement suits

discretion that we are talking about here is a

MRS. STILLMAN;

Well, Your Honor, are you

4

suggesting that this was an abuse of discretion or that

5

there is no discretion?

6

the exercise of discretion is not really up here.

7

What's up here is what the First Circuit said, which is

8

the court simply has no discretion in these cases, and

9

that's really what we are --

10

QUESTION;

Because I think the question of

Well, is there a case -- do you

11

have any support -- I know you rely on the Hecht case --

12

but any case in which a government agency has been

13

violating the law and it is within its power to cease

14

the violatin forthwith, and the court has said well, go

15

ahead and continue violating?

16

MRS. STILLMAN;

Well, I'm not sure there's any

17

case that has quite the facts of this where ceasing the

18

violation forthwith is ceasing an activity which would

19

be permitted under the permit that it's seeking.

20

QUESTION;

But it's illegal as of today.

21

QUESTION;

Well, what -- could the court have

22

said you are enjoined until you get the permit?

23

Wouldn't that sort of urge you to get it a little faster?

24

MRS. STILLMAN;

Well, it might, but we are

only suggesting that the court didn’t have to do that.

the court have that authority?
MRS. STILLMAN;

We say the court has --

certainly, the court has equitable discretion.

And even

5

a court of equity exercising the kind of discretion that

6

we're saying it has here, of course, has discretion to

7

enter an injunction upon a proper balance of factors.

8

But as we understand the question that we are asking

9

this Court to resolve, it is does the court have

10

discretion to enter this kind of order upon a proper

11

showing of factors.

12

said, is they don't.

13

there is a literal violation of the Act, that’s it, and

you have to have an immediate cessation of the discharge.

If there is any example of expressio

The Judiciary

11

was kept out of this process, and for a very good reason.
First, Congress said that’s the way they

12

13

wanted to handle it, and secondly, the presidential

14

exemption procedure is inherently a political, technical

15

and indeed, a military determination that a district

MR. HODGES;

Your Honor, no.

10

Of course, here we're dealing with

MR. HODGES:

14

Yes,

And there is

Isn't that true?
Your Honor,

in this

15

particular case I would say that there is.

We have a --

16

all that is necessary we believe in the case is the

17

substantive prohibition; the substantive prohibition

18

that comes from Section 301(a)

19

402.

20

And there's a good reason for it -- to allow the expert

21

agencies to take a look at this thing.

22

You do not need --

23

QUESTION:

combined with Section

You need to have that permit before you pollute.

All that says is that, you know,

24

you’ve made out a substantive violation, but

traditionally that is not all that a court of equity

requires
MR. HODSESi

Your Honor, what the court of

3

equity has required -- again, it depends on what kind of

4

tradition we’re speaking of.

5

we were speaking of a situation where there was no

6

statute that was being violated.

7

I would agree with that if

But where a statute has been violated, -- and

8

I now refer to the decision in the Rondeau v. Mosinee

9

Paper Corporation, and in the facts of the Hecht case

10

where compliance has been achieved -- there was a

11

violation but there was no further violation -- there

12

was no need to grant an injunction.

13

But where — and I’m now referring to the

14

Rondeau case -- the traditional test of the granting of

15

injunctive relief is, one, is there a violation, and

16

secondly, is that violation ongoing.

17

precisely the case here.

18

Navy has violated the statute, and there's no question

19

that they continued to violate it at the time the act

20

was done and they are doing it now.

21

And that is

There is no question that the

Over 1000 bombs were dropped into the coastal

22

waters of Vieques in the first seven months of 1981.

If

23

there ever was an ongoing violation, that’s it.

Congress said you can't do that.

ME. HODGES;

Not in those substantive

22

However, Your Honor,

we rely on the

23

substantive sections, and

I also rely on the fact that

24

in — that this Congress did not write on a clean slate

25

when it enacted the 1972 statute.

It took away a

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
9

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

provision from the old statute,

which indeed had existed

2

since 1948, that allowed for the formulation of decrees

3

by the court on the basis of equity and other factors.

4

That was gotten rid of by the court in -- by

5

the Congress in 1972 and in its place it substituted an

6

elaborate scheme -- extraordinary, 125 pages in the

7

committee print -- of exactly how Congress wanted to

8

have these matters handled.

9

And under those circumstances, Your Honor, we

10

feel that the thrust of this Act is to, with respect to

11

having a permit, is categorical; it is required where

12

compliance is, indeed,

13

possible.

I'd like to briefly address certain questions,

14

if I can, that were posed by the Navy here.

The fact

15

that there were no effluent guidelines does not make --

16

does not release the Navy from having to have a permit.

17

Section 402 says that prior to the time that any

18

effluent guidelines or other provisions may have been

19

enacted, a permit -- that the EPA could put in any

20

provision that it wishes to have.

21

Furthermore, the facts -- the Navy says that

22

well, they feel that this would be the best particular

23

accommodation, that they think is necessary.

24

this Court has said not what is appropriate, but what

25

did Congress provide.

But again,

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Let me make one other point.

The Navy has

2

said that the interests of Puerto Rico really were

3

protected by the district court.

4

to really secondguess the entire process.

5

secondguesses the administrative process, it

6

secondguesses what the President had done.

7

respect to the administrative process, the

8

administrative process that the EPA will go into is more

9

than — well, are things being banged up out there.

10

But what this does is
It

And with

They are going to look into monitoring, they

11

are going to look into -- which

12

When the EPA looks at this, it will cover

15

other things like what kind of limitations, when, where,

16

how, and a number of things that a district court simply

17

does not look at.

18

particular state are, indeed, not protected by what the

19

district court, this district court, did in this

20

particular case.

21

QUESTION;

And therefore, the interests of the

Mr. Hodges, don't you really think

22

that TV A versus Hill can be read as establishing the

23

principle that normally, federal courts will, of course,

24

enforce federal statutes and violations, but -- and as a

25

matter of good jurisprudence, the court would not

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

decline to enforce a clear statutory provision.
However, that is not the same thing as saying

2
3

that the court has no reserved equitable power.

4

think the court in Hill said that we have no power

5

reserved in the federal courts to refuse an injunction

6

within the equitable discretion of the court.
ME. HODGES;

7

I don't

Your Honor, I think that, again,

8

the thrust of TVA v. Hill was to say what did Congress

9

provide.

And it is the job of the courts to do what

10

Congress provided when it's addressed the problem and it

11

has resolved it.

12

And really, I think that is the thrust of that

13

particular case.

It's a recognition of the proper roles

14

of the three functions -- proper roles of the three

15

branches of goverment.

16

think that a traditional balancing of equities would be

17

improper, and that a court should do what the court of

18

appeals did in this case, which is to take a look at the

19

statute, the statutory purposes, and look at this with

20

the statutory purposes clearly in mind and with an acute

21

sense of what Congress driving at in this statute, and

22

then proceed to act.

MR. HODGES;

Your Honor, that is correct.

3

in the context of this case, to decline to act, to

4

enforce, a clear directive of how Congress said it

5

wanted to have something done, when it really has

7

discretion.

Even on a temporary basis to

10

actually facilitate the operation of the congressional

11

12

MR. HODGES;

Your Honor, there may be other

13

cases, but this case, what the district court did did

14

not facilitate the compliance, because what it said was

15

I am making a determination — or what it did was to

16

make a determination that was to be made by the

17

President of the United States in clear contravention of

18

what this particular statute said.

19

Under these circumstances, and since there is

20

a direct requirement that there be a permit prior to

21

discharges, we would say that it would be an abuse of

22

the court’s discretion under those circumstances.

why would they draw a
