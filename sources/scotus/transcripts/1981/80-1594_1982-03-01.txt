We will hear arguments

KNEEDLER*

Thank

you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court, this case is here on writ

10

of certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.

The

11

question presented is whether the court of claims has

12

jurisdiction under the Tucker Act of a suit to recover

13

on a claim for benefits under Part B of the Medicare

14

program.

Mr. Kneedler, may I ask one —
Yes.

May I ask a preliminary question,

like Justice Brennan did, the converse of his question?

8

Supposing we reversed here and held there was a remedy

for this provider.

Would that also mean there would be

10

a remedy for the Part B claimant in the other case in

11

the court of claims?

12

In other words, if we reversed you, would that

mean there would be a judicial remedy in the other case,

claims review.

if the question of bias goes to the question of whether

unclear under the court of claims decision in this case

how closely it would look into the facts in a particular

QUESTION:

2

But let me rephrase it.

If we

3

found there was a remedy for a provider, would it

4

necessarily follow there would also be a remedy for the

5

insured?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:
Yes.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I misunderstood

7

your question.

Under — under the Part B program,

8

the individual beneficiary can either submit his claim

9

himself or he can assign it to the doctor or other

10

person who furnished the services, but the procedural

11

rights of the two are the same.

12

The Act and the implementing regulations make

13

clear that the doctor or other furnishers' procedural

14

rights derive entirely from those of the beneficiary,

15

and in fact the Act provides that when the doctor is

16

paid on a particular claim, that the claim is really on

17

behalf of the beneficiary.

18

review, as for purposes of the administrative review

19

involved in the earlier case, the rights are the same.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

So, for purposes of judicial

Thank you.
As I mentioned, the Part A

22

program provides insurance for hospital and related

23

post-hospital services.

24

provides insurance for doctor services, medical

25

supplies, ex-rays, laboratory tests.

Part B, involved in this case,

Under Part B, 80

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

percent of the reasonable charge for these services is

2

paid by Medicare.

3

As the court of claims described it in this

4

case, the Medicare Part B program is vast and complex.

5

There are many millions of claims submitted annually by

6

or on behalf of 27 million beneficiaries, and largely

7

for — because of the scope of the program, Congress

8

provided that the claims would be administered by

9

private insurance carriers.

10

Now, as I mentioned, claims can be submitted

11

when a person finds or believes that he has received

12

services that are covered by the Act, the claim can be

13

submitted either on his own behalf or by the physician,

14

but as I mentioned, this has no effect on the

15

jurisdictional question in this case, but when the claim

16

is first submitted to the carrier, if the claimant,

17

either the beneficiary or the assignee, is dissatisfied

18

with the carrier's determination of the amount, if any,

19

that should be paid on that particular claim, he can

20

seek the fair hearing by the carrier that was discussed

21

in the previous case.

22

However, the Act does not provide for judicial

23

review of that benefit amount determination.

This is in

24

contrast to the scheme under Part A, the hospital

25

insurance program.

Under Part A, Congress has expressly
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

provided for a right of judicial review when a request

2

for payment for hospital services is denied, and in that

3

case the review is not in the court of claims, as the

4

court of claims held in this case, but it is pursuant to

5

Section 405(g) of Title 42, which is the standard

6

judicial review provision of the Social Security Act.
This provision is consistent with the fact

7

8

that the Medicare Act, which is simply Title 18 of the

9

Social Security Act, and Congress incorporated the

10

standard judicial review procedure under Part A for

11

those purposes.
The Respondent in this case is a distributor

12
v

13

of medical supplies used by patients who are undergoing

14

kidney maintenance dialysis in their homes.

15

these patients, customers of Respondent, are

16

beneficiaries under the Part B Medicare program.

17

Respondent would mail the medical supplies, often in the

18

forms of kits containing all the necessary supplies for

19

home dialysis, to patients around the country, and when

20

the patients were enrolled under Part B, they would in

21

return assign their right to be reimbursed for 80

22

percent of the reasonable charge for these supplies back

23

to Respondent.

24
25

Many of

Respondent would then collect these assigned
claims and submit them to the Prudential Insurance

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Company, which is the carrier designated for the

2

processing of the claims received by Respondent.

3

The period involved in this case in particular

4

is the years — are the years 1974 through 1976.

5

Respondent became dissatisfied over a period of time

6

with the amount that it was receiving in reimbursement

7

for the supplies that were furnished to the patients,

8

and Respondent requested that Prudential recalculate the

9

reasonable charge on which the reimbursement would be

10

made, and requested that this be done both retroactively

11

for charges that had already been paid and prospectively

12

for the remainder of the particular fiscal year.

13

Prudential did choose to make a prospective

14

adjustment for one particular product because of

15

exceptional circumstances affecting the price of that

16

product, but for other items, the carrier declined to

17

make an adjustment, principally because of a provision

18

in the Act which limits the amount of reimbursement to

19

the prevailing charge for the particular service in the

20

locality during the preceding calendar year, so the Act

21

has a built-in limit or ceiling on the amount that can

22

be — that can be paid out.

23

Prudential's determinations in this regard

24

were sustained after the fair hearing by the carrier,

25

and Respondent then brought this action in the court of
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

claims.

Again, Respondent alleged that the amount that

2

Prudential had paid on its asssignei claims was

3

insufficient, and it sought to recover from the United

4

States a money judgment equivalent to the amount of

5

these alleged underpayments .
There is no issue in this case of whether the

6

7

particular supplies were covered by Part B.

This is

8

simply a question of the amount that would be paid for

9

those services.
The United States argued in the court of

10
11

claims that the court was without jurisdiction, because

12

the text and legislative history of the Medicare Act

13

demonstrated that Congress intended to foreclose

14

judicial review of individual benefit determinations

15

under Part B.

16

405(h) of the — of Title 42 as incorporated into the

17

Medicare Act precluded judicial review of these claims.

The government also argued that Section

The court of claims, however, rejected these

18
19

arguments.

In that's — in that court's view, judicial

20

review must be available in the court of claims of

21

Medicare claims pursuant to the Tucker Act absent clear

22

and convincing evidence of the Congressional intent to

23

bar judicial review in a Tucker Act suit.

24

acknowledged that Congress had expressly provided for

25

judicial review under Part A, but not under Part B, but

The court

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Court declined to view this omission as a

2

foreclosure of judicial review.

3

In the court of claims' analysis, the express

4

provision for judicial review under Part A simply

5

demonstrated that Congress wanted those particular

6

provisions followed, but in other cases, such as in Part

7

B, where Congress declined to provide for judicial

8

review, that review would be available under what the

9

court of claims termed general jurisdictional

10

provisions, such as the Tucker Act.
The court also rejected the argument based on

11
12

Section 405(h) of the Social Security Act, observing

13

that it had previously declined to extend this Court's

14

decision in Weinberger versus Salfi, concerning the

15

meaning of 405(h) to Medicare cases in the court of

16

claims.

17

On the merits, the court of claims remanded to

18

Prudential for a recomputation of the prevailing charge

19

level in the preceding years, and also remanded for

20

Prudential to reconsider whether to grant a retroactive

21

adjustment for the cost of the particular product that

22

Prudential had granted a prospective adjustment in the

23

reasonable charge for.

24
25

The court of claims rejected as insubstantial

2

the previous year's prevailing charge limitations.

United States petitioned for certiorari in this Court

4

only on the jurisdictional question.

5

requested the Court to review the merits of the court of

6

claims decision.

The

Neither party has

The position of the United States in this case

7
8

is that the jurisdictional holding of the court of

9

claims is inconsistent with the decisions of this Court

10

concerning the scope of the court of claims*

11

jurisdiction under the Tucker Act.

12

is also directly contrary to the text of the Medicare

13

Act itself, and to the.clearly expressed Congressional

14

intent, both when the Medicare Act was enacted in 1965

15

and when it was amended in 1972, to bar judicial review

16

of individual reimbursement disputes on Medicare claims

in order to avoid deluging the courts with these sorts

governing Tucker Act jurisdiction in the court of

2

claims, and as — as to that we submit that the court of

3

claims was plainly wrong in concluding that judicial

5

be presumed to exist in the court of claims absent clear

rule is precisely the opposite, as this Court's recent

8

decisions in Testan and Mitchell make clear.

In fact, the

In those cases, the Court has reiterated the

established rule that the United States as the sovereign

Yes.

We cite in our reply

14

infrequently that an individual claimant will sue a

protection is the Secretary’s oversight of the — of the

4

How, as I mentioned, under the Tucker Act, in

order for the court of claims to have jurisdiction, it

6

is necessary to find the waiver of sovereign immunity.

7

Respondent concedes that there is nothing on the face of

the Medicare Act and nothing in the legislative history

indicating specifically that Congress intended to remove

the sovereign immunity of the United States in the

12

case, because of the line of this Court's decisions

13

concerning Tucker Act jurisdiction that I discussed

14

before, but I think this is particularly so when we

15

consider the nature of the Part B Medicare program.

16

Now, this should be dispositive of the

A court should not lightly infer that Congress

17

would have exposed the executive and judicial branches

18

to the possibility of suit without regard even to the

19

have made an error in the particular computation of the

21

amount due on a particular claim or the application of a

22

regulation or instruction to a particular claim.

23

determinations generally involve a relatively small

24

amount of money, often involve the exercise of medical

25

judgment, and in addition, the reimbursible reasonable

1

charge for a particular service may vary from locality

2

to locality, and in fact, it was precisely for this

3

reason that Congress chose to rely on the expertise of

4

the carriers who service the particular areas to

5

determine the reasonable charge rates.
But it is not necessary here to rely only on

6
7

the nature of the Part B program and Respondent's

8

concession that there is nothing specific in the

9

Medicare Act consenting to suit, for in this case the

10

text and the legislative history of Part B demonstrate

11

convincingly that Congress intended to foreclose review

12

of the determination of the amount of benefits due in a

13

particular case.

14

how Congress could have expressed its intent any more

15

clearly.

Indeed, it is difficult to conceive

First, the text of the Medicare Act makes

16
17

clear that Congress did not intend to expose the United

18

States to suit in these circumstances.

19

significance, we submit, is Section

20

42.

21

Social Security Act that deals with the circumstances

22

under which an individual beneficiary is entitled to

23

judicial review of matters under the Medicare program.

24

Of particular

1395(ff) of Title

This is the provision in the Medicare title of the

Section 1395(ff) provides for judicial review
under Part A, the hospital program, both with respect to

2

program at all, in other words, his initial enrollment,

3

and in addition, in certain circumstances with respect

4

.to individual claims for reimbursement for hospital

5

services, although the Act provides for judicial review

6

only where the amount in controversy is $1,000 or more.
Under Part B of the Medicare program, however,

7

8

1395(ff) provides for judicial review at the behest of

9

the beneficiary only with respect to his initial

10

enrollment in the Part B program, whether he is entitled

11

to enroll, and whether there is" any factual question

12

about whether he has enrolled.

13

contain a provision for judicial review of benefit

14

determinations, and we regard this as quite significant,

15

because that is the only section that deals with a

16

beneficiary's right to judicial review.

1395(ff) does not

Therefore, the clear import of Congress's

17
18

provision of judicial review in one circumstance,

19

one-half of the program and not the other, would appear

20

to be that Congress didn't intend for judicial review

21

under Part B.
QUESTION:

22

Bell, that point has nothing to do

23

with the court of claims or waiver of sovereign

question of reviewability of an administrative decision.

It is just a question of — an ordinary

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

2

QUESTION^

That’s correct, although I —

And isn’t — in that context, isn't

3

the presumption normally in favor of reviewability, if

4

that is all you are talking about?

5

MR. KNEEDLERs

Yes, if this were a standard

6

APA type judicial review of agency action, that would be

7

so, but there is another feature of the Medicare Act

8

which runs up against that presumption, and that is

9

Section 405(h), but while this case specifically

10

concerns the court of claims* Tucker Act jurisdiction,

11

we submit that the provisions that Congress has — or

12

Congress’s failure to provide some other method of

13

judicial review is equally relevant, because again the

14

standard provision for judicial review of determinations

15

under the Social Security Act, whether it is under the

16

old age and survivor portion or under Part B of

17

Social Security Act, standard review in the district

challenged .

22

Now, there is no reason to think that — and

23

incidentally, I should add that the court of claims has

24

held that it is without jurisdiction over individual

25

social security claims in cases that we have cited in

separate statutory —
QUESTION;

3

Well, if the court of claims is

4

right, why couldn't anyone just, except for soveriegn

5

immunity, you could just get review in the district

6

court, if they are right about reviewability.
NR. KNEEDLER;

7

Well, the — if there would be

8

review anywhere, it would ordinarily be the district

9

court.

10

QUESTION;

Yes.

11

MR. KNEEDLER;

That's correct, but Congress

12

has separately addressed that problem by barring review

13

there, but the court of claims has inappropriately

14

applied the presumption in favor of judicial review to

15

the — to the court of claims in which the — the

16

opposite principles apply that a right of action does

17

not exist unless Congress has affirmatively granted it.

18

Now, it does, going back, for a moment to the

19

fact that Congress has provided for judicial review in

20

other circumstances under the Social Security Act in

21

Section 405(g), there is no reason to think that

22

Congress would have somehow thought that that particular

23

form of review is inappropriate for Part B Medicare

24

claims, and decided that somehow the court of claims

25

would be a better forum for those particular disputes.
19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

In fact, one would assume that exactly the contrary

2

would be true, because these are relatively small claims

3

for which Congress would more reasonably have wanted to

4

have review in the district courts, not concentrated in

5

the court of claims.

6

Now, Respondent has suggested that the failure

7

of Congress to provide for judicial review in 1395(ff),

8

which contains the judicial review provisions of the

9

Medicare Act, is not significant because individual

10

reimbursement disputes are handled under another section

11

of the Medicare Act, 1395(u), which is the section

12

dealing with the carriers' obligations.

13

with that argument is that Congress didn't provide for

14

judicial review of a carrier's decision under that

15

section, either.

16

Respondent has identified as being relevant, there is an

17

absence of any provision for judicial review, and we

18

think that this is particularly significant again in

19

light of Section 405(h) of the Social Security Act.

20

The difficulty

So, in the only two sections that

The second sentence of Section 405(h) provides

21

that no findings of fact or decision of the Secretary

22

shall be reviewed by any tribunal except as specifically

23

provided in the Act, and as incorporated in the Medicare

24

Act, that would mean except as specifically provided in

25

the Medicare Act, and as I have mentioned, there is no
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

such provision
Now, as Justice Stevens asked, it is our

2
3

position that the carrier for these purposes and for

4

purposes of Section 405(h) and the manifest

5

Congressional purpose underlying it, that the preclusion

6

of judicial review by any other tribunal, and that would

7

include the court of claims, would apply equally to Part

8

B claims as it would apply to Part A claims.
If there were any doubt lingering after

9
10

examination of the text of the Medicare Act regarding

11

Congress’s intent to foreclose judicial review, we think

12

that that would be dispelled by an examination of the

13

legislative history of both the original 1965 Act and

14

the 1972 amendments to the Act.

15

legislative history at Pages 27 through 30 of our

16

opening brief, and at Pages 7 through 9 of our reply

17

brief.

18

We have set forth that

Of particular significance is the passage in

19

the Senate report which outlines the different means of

20

review of determinations under Part A and Part B.

21

Senate report points out that there is a right to a

22

hearing by the Secretary and judicial review under Part

23

A where there is at least ?1,000 in controversy, but

24

under Part B, the Senate report points out that the

25

carriers would review beneficiary complaints regarding

the amount of benefits, and "the bill does not provide

2

for judicial review of a determination concerning the

3

amount of benefits under Part B where claims will

4

probably be for substantially smaller amounts than under

5

Part A."

6

in the generality of cases, the sorts of claims that

7

would arise under Part B were relatively trivial

8

amounts, that it was inappropriate to burden the courts

9

with reviewing that.

10

Congress had made a legislative judgment that

But Congress just didn't do this in 1965, it

11

revisited the statute in 1972 and revisited the judicial

12

review provisions because some lower courts -- court

13

decisions had carved out what appeared to be an

14

unintended loophole allowing beneficiaries under Part A

15

and Part B to obtain judicial review of essentially

16

coverage questions as to whether a particular service

17

was covered by the statute, without regard to the amount

18

of controversy under Part A, and without regard to the

19

absence of any judicial review generally under Part B,

20

and this was — the introduction and passage of this is

21

discussed on Page 30 of our brief.

22

Senator Bennett, who introduced the revisions

23

to 1395(ff), pointed out that it was the intention of

24

the -- of Congress in 1965 to keep these relatively

25

small claims out of court when it enacted the 1965 Act.

The conference reported adopted Senator Bennett's

2

language, and the conference report states, the Senate

3

amendment added a new section to the House bill which

4

would make clear "that there is no authorization for an

5

appeal to the Secretary or for judicial review on

6

matters solely involving amounts of benefits under Part

7

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Oleskey.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN H. OLESKEY, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. OLESKEY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, I think, there is some agreement

11

between the government and Erika on some of the issues

12

that were iiscussed by Mr. Kneedler and also earlier by

13

the Solicitor General in the McClure case.

14

Those points of agreement, I think, add up to

15

acknowledging Erika's central proposition to this Court

16

today, which is that under these circumstances where, as

17

was earlier conceded, a unique or sui generis system has

18

been evolved to deal with 27 million covered

19

beneficiaries in a voluntary program, where $11 a month,

20

going to $12.20 soon, I understand, is paid in premiums,

21

is delegated fully and finally with no judicial recourse

22

anywhere to a private insurance carrier.

23

And it is our proposition today that due

24

process, meaning some review by some court, is

25

fundamental in this circumstance, and given the
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

particular context in which Erika's claim arose, namely

2

a claim by assignment in this case in the hundreds of

3

thousands of dollars for Part B benefit claims, money,

4

that the appropriate forum to review at least the

5

constitutional and statutory aspects of that claim is

6

the United States Court of Claims under the Tucker Act.
QUESTION:

7

Hell, would you — would you say it

8

would be unconstitutional for the -- for the law to have

9

precluded review if the system had been wholly — if the

10

claim system and the review system had been carried out

11

by government officials, by the Secretary's people

12

itself?

13

NR. OLESKEY:

14

QUESTION:

15
16

Well —

Would you have to be able to get

into court?
MR. OLESKEY:

I would say in that case that

17

you would go to the test, Mr. Justice White, that the

18

Court articulated in Mathews and Eldridge, and balance

19

the interest if there was an unequivocal indication

20

that, I think as you asked earlier, there had been no

21

intent to provide any review.

22

that analysis has to be the inquiry as to whether the

23

intent has been expressed to wholly deny judicial review.

24
25

The starting point in

In this case, we are in — we are in, in my
judgment, at least, a stronger position in insisting

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that due process requires judicial review, because you

2

don't even have an agency of the government which has

3

been presumed at more fairly, at least in many cases,

4

making the review through an ALJ, where you have a

5

private insurance carrier with a built-in bias and

6

interest that was pointed out in McClure making a total

7

and final determination if the government is right.

8

But the specific answer to your question is,

9

you would have to look at whether Congress had clearly

10

and unequivocally intended to deny any right of review

11

from the administrative decision in the government, and

12

then see on the balancing test under Mathews and

13

Eldridge whether in this Court’s judgment that was still

14

an appropriate action for Congress to take.

15

The only instance that I have been able to

16

locate in the cases that the government cited where

17

there hasn't been a specific provision for such a review

18

would be in the veterans* benefit cases, for example,

19

Johnson and Robison, although that case didn't go off on

20

the review issue at such, which seems to have been

21

recognized by Congress as a special area, because they

22

view pensions as a special area, and there is

23

legislative history in that area which you cited in

24

Johnson and Robison where Senator George in 1940 says,

25

in substance, we just have always seen pensions as
26

1

different, and you don't get judicial review because we

2

want a uniform system, which today would be treated

3

again, I think, by this Court on a Mathews and Eldridge

4

balancing test, but the fact is —

MR. OLESKEY:

QUESTIONS

3

MR. OLESKEY:

We would say

Contrary to the law.
We would say in some cases that

4

the mandamus statute may be properly invoked against the

5

Secretary if his — if his action is egregious enough

6

and if there is no money claim which can otherwise be

7

presented in the court of claims.

8

This case, or the implications of this case

9

are surely broader than the issue which is before you

10

here, but it happens that the case is so framed because

11

Erika did have a claim for money, and the court of

12

claims had said, starting in 1976, in the Whitecliff

13

case, that it would take jurisdiction of such cases

14

because it did not feel it was precluded either by Salfi

15

or 405(h) in these limited circumstances from examining

16

constitutional or statutory violations of the Medicare

17

Act in the context of examining or deliberating upon

18

money claims made by the carrier below.
QUESTION;

19

Mr. Oleskey, you emphasize the

20

point that you rely on a contractual claim here, whereas

21

Salfi involve a claim that Congress could revoke.

22

do you claim that the beneficiary here has a contractual

23

claim as well as your having sort of a third party

24

ben efit?

25

MR. OLESKEY;

That’s right.

Sow,

We say that we

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

stand in the beneficiary's shoes.
QUESTION*

2

And why does the beneficiary here

3

have a greater contractual claim than a social security

4

claimant?

5

MR. OLESKEYs

Well, I would say principally,

6

Mr. Justice Stevens, because the beneficiary here,

7

rather than simply having benefitted as someone whose

8

wages were taken involuntarily over the course of his

9

working life under the social security system, has

10

voluntary agreed with the government to make an extra

11

payment monthly, which as I say is now $11, in order to

12

have the benefit of Part B coverage.

13

forward and agreed to enter into an undertaking that is

14

different in kind and amount that anybody enters into in

15

any other benefit program, including social security.

16

In return for that, he is entitled to the assurance that

17

the claims will be paid in accordance with the statute

18

and the regulation, and ultimately that comes down to

19

whether or not either the beneficiary or the carrier in

20

this — the provider who was supplied by assignment is

21

going to be paid in accordance with this reasonable

22

charge language in the statute.

23

He has stepped

One of the problems here, as the court of

24

claims saw, was that the statute on its face was not

25

being honored by the carrier in the fair hearing.

The

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

constitutional claim that we raise which was a denial of

2

just compensation under the due process clause, was

3

denied, but the court of claims, as its decision makes

4

clear, found fundamentally that the statute on its face

5

as applied by the carrier had not been honored.

6

was for Erika here as for other — as for other

7

suppliers in other instances no other place to go in

8

this circumstance, if the government is right that the

9

court of claims is foreclosed.

There

Although the government in its brief has

10
11

attempted to mitigate or downplay the implications of

12

its position, it has argued consistently, to my

13

knowledge, since at least 1976 in every circuit and in

14

the court of claims that Congress intended that there

15

being no review of any type of benefits denial under

16

Part B, no matter how egregious the denial — the action

17

by the carrier, including the affirmation in the fair

18

hearing .

19

The answer to the question that was posed

20

earlier, I think, which was that the Secretary himself

21

could be expected to be the final authority who would

22

ensure that in effect due process was done is illusory,

23

and not really accurate.

24

believe that the Secretary is going to deal ultimately

25

in a due process sense fully and fairly with law

There is no more reason to

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

questions under the statute and certainly under the

2

Constitution, the latter being beyond his authority

3

anyway, than the -- than the hearing officer will, and

4

that is the vice of the system.

5

The McClure Joint Appendix mak.es it clear that

6

the hearing officer, and we would say the ALJ if Judge

7

Orrick’s decision was going to be sustained, are in

8

exactly the same position, and that Joint Appendix, at

9

21 and 51 respectively, points out that the authority of

10

the hearing officer is limited to the extent that he

11

must comply with all provisions of Title 18 of the Act,

12

all regulations, all HCFA rulings, general instructions

13

and other guides issued by HCFA or the Medicare Bureau.

14

The hearing officer does not have the prerogative of

15

overruling the provisions of the law or interpreting

16

them in a way different than that of the Medicare Bureau

17

when he is in disagreement with their intent, nor may he

18

use hearing decisions as a vehicle for commenting upon

19

the legality, constitutionality, or otherwise of the

20

provisions of the program.

21

authority is definitively restricted by these

22

parameters.

23

It goes on to say that his

So, if the Secretary, as my brother has

24

argued, is overlapping and fully to be seen, which in

25

fact he is not, since you don’t get a review to the
32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Secretary under the government's position at all, nor do

2

you get an appeal to the Secretary, but to the extent

3

they find the Secretary in his functions overlapping

4

with the hearing officer, the manual itself, which is

5

before you in the Joint Appendix, makes it clear that in

6

effect whatever the interpretation is that HCFA, the

7

child of HHS, puts on the statute or the regulations is

8

going to be binding both on the hearing officer and on

9

the Secretary in this supposed watchdog function.

10

In effect the question, I think, becomes the

11

old one of who is watching the watchdog where there is

12

no judicial recourse, when the watchdog is supposed to

13

be watching the carrier, with all the interest that you

14

heard earlier.

15

put, here is, no one is watching their watchdog, the

16

Secretary of HHS, and that is the vice, if they mean

17

their concession today, which I am sure they do, namely,

18

that due process requires some opportunity for a review

19

by a fair tribunal when property is about to be taken,

20

and the government has conceded here and in other cases

21

before this at lower levels that this interest under

22

Part B benefits is a property interest.

23

Well, the government’s answer, fairly

To address the second aspect of where we find

24

the waiver of sovereign immunity besides the contractual

25

relationship which we say Erika enjoys both as a third

1

party beneficiary and in its own right, that is in a

2

reading of the Medicare statute itself.

3

this Court said, and in other cases which the government

4

and we have cited, that sovereign immunity waiver can be

5

found in the Tucker Act by reference to a substantive

6

right, either a contract right, which I argue is present

7

here in several respects, or in a statute fairly read.

8

The government continues to confuse in my view the

9

notion that you have to look to that outside statute

Now, in Testan,

10

with its substantive rights in effect to fill the Tucker

11

need state explicitly, yes, you may sue the United

States.

14

other decisions of this Court in fact stand for.

I don't think that is what Testan or any of the

15

there, that you have to find the substantive right to

18

the right to sue.

19

Act, which is a general grant to sue the government

20

under various circum stances, as the Court is aware,

21

wouldn't have any meaning, because you would have to go

22

ahead on every statute and say, as the Congress, and, by

23

the way, the Tucker Act may be invoked if things go awry

24

under this statute and you have a money claim against

25

the United States.

Indeed, were it otherwise, the Tucker

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The fact is that the Congress has known when

2

it wanted to very clearly how to limit Tucker Act

3

jurisdiction when it would otherwise be found by

4

reference to some other statute conferring a substantive

5

right, either by contract, as here, or by virtue of the

6

statute itself, as here.

7

For example, I believe it is 28 United States

8

Code 1500 to 1502, provide three very explicit

9

limitations on the jurisdiction of the court of claims.

10

Those are that you can't sue in the court of claims

11

where you have brought a suit in some other court in

12

substance on the same ground; you can't sue for pension

13

rights -- that same theme that seems to be a special

14

area of the Congress — and you can't sue for rights

15

arising under treaties with foreign nations.

16

17

it wanted to limit Tucker Act jurisdiction, which the

court of claims has been asserting here broadly since

QUESTION;

In addition, there are Acts like —
Well, Testan and Hopkins, and cases

like that, where we have held the court of claims

overreached itself under the Tucker Act, certainly

24

limitations on court of claims jurisdiction.

25

NR. 0LESKEY;

That's correct, but in Testan,

for example, when you examine the two statutes which the

Petitioners had pointed to for the substantive rights,

there being no contract claim, unlike this case, you

found that neither the Back Pay Act nor the

5

Classification Act conferred a substantive right for

6

money damages for the misclassification that had gone

7

on.

8

are looking at a statutory scheme, an insurance policy,

9

as I think you yourself described this, Mr. Justice

10

Rehnquist, in Salfi, which provides for payments in

11

accordance with a policy term, which are the statute and

12

the regulations.

By contrast, here, under the Medicare statute, we

13

But Salfi, of course, was described

14

as an insurance policy, but clearly there there is no

15

contractual right under Fleming against Nestor.
MR. OLESKEYs

16

That's correct, and I tried to

17

recognize that by addressing the contractual nature of

18

the relationship here, and how I believe it differs from

19

that of a social security beneficiary as discussed in

20

Salfi.

21

cases like the veterans' statutes, in Robison,

22

specifically, when you were discussing what Congress had

bars, not silence, which the government insists on

reading as a concession here, but explicit statutory bar

which say, the decision of the administrator shall be

under any circumstances.

4

QUESTION:

Well, what about Senator Bennett's

5

statement in connection with the 1972 amendments, where

6

they found some of the lower courts were allowing the

7

thing to be circumvented, which very, very frequently

8

happens?

9

MR. OLESKEY:

Senator Bennett and the other

10

decisions which — the other language which the

11

government cites in its legislative history record

12

indicates clearly a Congressional concern that the

13

courts not be flooded with administrative — pure

14

administrative review decisions under Part B, thousands

15

of little decisions.

16

today, however, the decisions in fact are fairly few in

17

number that are not resolved in some respect or other to

18

the claimant or assignee’s benefit ultimately by the

19

time the fair hearing is over.

20

As the government has argued here

Of course, the government would also like to

21

have it both ways, because they have argued all the way

22

through in this case that if you allow the court of

23

claims to assert its own jurisdiction as it sees it

24

here, the floodgates are open and that court will be

25

flooded with thousands of claims.

Well, the $1,000

37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

limit that obviously prevails is one answer, and the

2

specialized nature of the court of claims jurisdiction,

3

including the money requirement, the claim against the

4

United States requirement, and the fact there are no

5

jury trials, and the fact that you have to come to

6

Washington,

7

as was established earlier, all answer that argument.

8

The fact is, to return to my earlier point,

9

D.C., which is expensive for most claimants,

when the Congress has wanted to say explicitly no

10

review, even in the risk of the constitutional dilemma

11

which the Court has rightly posed today, it has known

12

how to say it.

13

although — and although it is not cited by the

14

government or by us in our brief, in the Omnibus

15

Reconciliation Budget Acts of the last two years, there

16

have been extensive amendments made to the Medicare and

17

Medicaid legislation.

18

done to address this issue either before the court of

19

claims decision, but in the five years after the

20

Whitecliffe decision, or in the face of the Court’s

21

decision last year in Khitecliff — in this case.

22

It is significant in addition that

QUESTIONi

Is that the most you say about it?

2

MR. OLESKEYi

Well, I made the point earlier,

3

I hope, that where a property right is involved, where

4

there is this concededly unparalleled allegation to a

5

private entity, here, an insurance company, sometimes

6

Blue Cross-Blue Shield, to make final and irrevocable

7

decisions about the disposition of that property, if you

8

buy the — if you accept the government's position, I

9

think there is a constitutional issue about whether

10

Congress acted properly.

11

accept their position, for the reasons I have suggested.

12

The best statement of the dilemma that I could

13
14

I don't think you have to

find, I sat yesterday —
QUESTION:

So you are saying -- apparently

15

your submission is that even if all the claims machinery

16

was inside -- was in the hands of the Secretary's own

17

people, and he had given them a fair hearing, that

18

unless judicial review is provided, we have a

19

constitutional issue.

20

MR. OLESKEYi

Well, I say, if the Secretary

21

has the mechanism, which he doesn't here, it is all in

22

the carrier, there is no right of appeal to the

23

Secretary, and no judicial review from that point, then

24

you go back and look at your language about the clear

25

and unequivocal intent of Congress to withdraw

jurisdiction, and if you find that you still have to

2

apply'the Mathews and Eldridge three-pronged test

3

balancing those interests, but that is not this case.

4

It isn’t even close to this case, because the government

5

has made it clear that there is no right to go to the

6

Secretary —

7

QUESTION;

8

MB. OLESKEY:

9

Yes.
— in any respect on a Part B

benefit.
QUESTION;

10

Yes, but what if we — what if we

11

agree with the government in the other case, that that

12

is not a biased procedure or anything of the kind, and

13

it is a full and fair hearing?

14

though it were done by the Secretary himself.
MR. OLESKEY;

15

It is just as good as

If you agree with the government

16

in McClure that the district court should be reversed,

17

you still have the problem of decisions as to the

18

constitutionality of the Act or regulations or -- or

19

regulations under the Act which are beyond the power of

20

the Secretary himself to deal with, because he is the

21

Secretary.

22

That position was — was summed up in my

23

judgment very eloquently by Justice Brandeis in the St.

24

Joseph Stockyard case, which I discovered yesterday,

25

feeling that someone here would want to know
41

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

penultimately where that due process claim is ultimately

2

bottomed, and just briefly, he said, "When dealing with

3

constitutional rights, as distinguished from privileges

4

accorded by the government" — of course, we say that a

5

statutory claim here is something less than a

6

constitutional right but something more than a privilege

7

accorded by the government — "there must be the

8

opportunity of presenting in an appropriate proceeding

9

at some time to some court every question of law raised,

10

whatever the nature of the right invoked or the status

11

of him who claims it."

12

That is the difference really between an

13

Article III tribunal and the matters which an Article

14

III court like this one or the court of claims may hear

15

and matters which a legislative court, so-called, an

16

Article I court may hear, and typically the Secretary

17

has been held, I think, in repeated decisions of this

18

Court, whether of this department or any other, not to

19

be competent to pass on the constitutionality by

20

definition of his own actions.

21

The court of claims has said --

the United States would be without power to enter into a

judicial review of the government's performance.

4

HR. OLESKEY;

Well, the Tucker Act is an

5

explicit decision by Congress, which is obviously

6

exemplified in other areas, too, that would —

7

QUESTION;

We are just confining ourselves to

8

the constitutional question.

Would it be constitutional

9

for Congress to enter into a contract and authorize

10

somebody on behalf of the government to enter into a

11

contract with a private party and say, there shall be no

12

judicial remedy against the United States in the event

13

there is a breach?

14

MR. OLESKEY;

I would say, given the nature of

15

the contractual and statutory rights involved here,

16

have fairly defined them, the answer is, no, it wouldn't

17

be constitutional, but you don't have --

18

QUESTION;

What about my case?

if I

Just a simple,

19

there will be no contractual right against the United

or not, do you doubt the constitutionality of such a

2

statute ?

3

MR. OLESKEYs

Well, I can't answer the

4

question fairly, Mr. Justice Stevens, as posed that way,

5

but I think there is a freedom of contract involved in

6

dealing in that situation which may be held by this

7

Court not to be capable of being vindicated by any

8

court, but here, you have beneficiaries who have agreed

9

to pay their premiums monthly in order to receive

10

payment or compensation from the government determined

11

by a reasonable charge mechanism, which is defined in

12

the statute.

suggested --

15
16
17

That is a very different economic and

QUESTION*

Why?

Why?

Why is it different

from my case?
MR. OLESKEYs

Because there is more volition

You don’t have to go ahead and deal with the government

20

to buy the battleship.

22
23

QUESTION:

But I thought you stressed the fact

that this was voluntary as opposed to social security.
MR. OLESKEYs

It is voluntary, Mr. Justice

Rehnquist, but in the final analysis, as everyone

25

recognizes, for the medical protection that is involved,

Well, so you say then it is

MR. OLESKEY:

I say it is a voluntary act, but

it has to be seen against the goals of Congress and the

need which is being met, which — which makes it in a

10

11

practical sense mixed, a mixture of actions, but —
QUESTION:

As far as Erika was concerned,

12

though, it presumably knew that the carrier would

13

determine what reasonable charges are, and in that sense

14

it got exactly what it expected the statute would get.

15

MR. OLESKEY:

No, it didn't, because what it

16

bargained for in its relationship through its assignors

17

was a reasonable charge determination in accordance with

18

the statute.

19

was that by taking Erika's catalogues, which gave one

20

price for one point in time from 12 to 24 months earlier

21

than the period for which compensation or reimbursement

22

was being made, Prudential had fundamentally violated

QUESTION*

Well, I am aware of the claim, but

3

it just seems to me that Erika realized when it

4

undertook to enter into the relationship that these

5

questions were going to be answered by the carrier, and

6

took that risk.

7

HR. OLESKEY:

Well, it took a risk if the

8

questions weren't -- if the claims weren't paid

9

accurately that some day a court might decide there was

10

no recourse —

11

QUESTION*

That's right.

12

MR. OLESKEY*

— but you have to read the

13

statutes with hindsight to Erika as mandating no

14

recourse rather than merely as being silent in terms of

15

judicial review through the district courts for good

16

reason to come up with that conclusion.

17

it's fair in hindsight to say that Erika was totally on

18

warning in dealing with the government that some day the

19

argument would be made here and accepted by this Court --

20

QUESTION:

I don't think

Well, Mr. Oleskey, what about the

— what about the language on Page 27 and 28 of the

when you have been able to reduce the issue to the

and there would be no judicial review, so that

eliminated the first question you have here.

constitutional question of the right of Congress to deny

MR. GLESKEY:

Hell, that — the --

19

QUESTION;

But no review was allowed.

20

QUESTION;

The Congress appears to have been

particularly concerned about rights in that instance.

22

because I noted in looking at the United States Code

that they had withdrawn explicitly Tucker Act

performed, and you have what anybody would say is a --

is a justifiable contract claim which you can say is a

being paid, why wouldn't you say that it would be

unconstitutional for the United States to claim

sovereign immunity in those cases?
MR. OLESKEY:

10

I don’t think I can better

answer the question than by pointing to the nature of

see whether sovereign immunity was constitutional or not
MR. 0LESKEY;

9

Well, sovereign immunity is the

sovereign's inherent right to limit its suit.

11

are saying is that where, as here, it is fairly inferred

12

either from the statute or from a contractual

relationshp or both that there is some recourse for this

I’m not — I'm not so sure that

is nothing on the face of this to suggest that Congress

provision of that contract, as Respondent characterizes

it, derives from the Act itself.

one of the provisions of that contract would necessarily

The other point I wanted to mention with
