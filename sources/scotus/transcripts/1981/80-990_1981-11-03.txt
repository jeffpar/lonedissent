ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM F. STEWART, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS
MR. STEWART*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9 the Court, this case involves the validity of state
10 citizenship requirements for certain specified classes of
11 public employees.

It is an appeal from a decision of a

12 three-judge federal court holding that it was
13 unconstitutional for California to require its probation
14 officers to be citizens, and that further, California's
15 statutory scheme which required peace officers in several
16 enumerated categories to be citizens was unconstitutionally
17 overbroad.
18

The plaintiffs in this case were all applicants

19 for only one peace officer position, that of deputy
20 probation officer with the County of Los Angeles.

This is

21 the second appeal in the case, the Court having granted the
22 appeal and remanded it back to the three-judge court for
23 reconsideration in light of its recently published decision
24 in Foley versus Connelie.

The second time around, the

25 District Court again by a two to one vote held that it was

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 unconstitutional to require citizenship of deputy probation
2 officers, and

that the statute was unconstitutionally

3 overbroad.
4

California 's statutory scheme sets forth many

5 enumerated and

specific categories of peace officers, and

6 also sets forth the qualification for peace officers,
7 which

is citizenship of the United States.

one of

The California

8 statutory scheme also considers and imposes certain training
9 requirements on

the enumerated categories of peace officers.

This case calls once again on this Court to

10
11 consider

as it did in Foley and Ambach whether certain

12 occupations,
13 officers,

public occupations, in this case probation

are of such a nature that they can be

The second issue, of course, is whether or not the

statutory scheme was unconstitutionally
We believe that the three-judge federal court

18 seriously erred when

it concluded that the probation

QUESTION:

required.
Mr. Stewart, when you say that the

22 scheme was considered overbroad,
23 to

I take it you are referring

the Court’s language in Sugarman against Dougall that a

24 narrowly tailored

scheme would do.

Do you think that has to

25 do with statutory

draftsmanship as to what positions are

1 included and what are not?

Or just rather vague language in

2 the statute itself?
3

MR. STEWART;

I think that the Sugarman language

4 should be limited to the context of that particular case in
5 the sense that in Sugarman the New York statute struck down
6 encompassed all classes of civil service servants in New
7 York without distinction.
8

QUESTION;

That's the --

Well, didn't the Court's languag

9 Court, our language focus on the fact that it include
10 garbage collectors?
11

MR. STEWART;

That is right, Your Honor.

It was

12 overbroad because it included all categories of civil
13 servants, from garbage collectors to clerk typists to
14 perhaps police officers and the like.
15

QUESTION;

The California statutes are just about

16 as bad as New York, aren't they?

You cover cemetery sextons

17 and toll takers, and demand citizenship for those as well,
18 don ' t you?
19

MR. STEWART;

Well, we no longer demand

20 citizenship of sextons, Your Honor.
21

QUESTION;

Well, I am glad to hear that.

22

MR. STEWART;

The California legislature in 1980

23 took another look at the statute, and there were several
24 categories that were eliminated, of which one category was
25 cemetery sextons, custodial officers, and there were several

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

other categories, but the difference betwee n the California

that of New York is that they s pecifically --

1 say that justification would apply to just everybody.
2

MR. STEWART;

3

QUESTION:

That is exactly right.

And if it purports to, it tends to

4 impugn the justification.
5

We --

MR. STEWART:

Isn’t that what --

That is the position that we -- that

6 is the way we read Sugarman, Your Honor.
7

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Stewart, if we were to agree

8 that deputy probation officers as police officers cannot be
9 required constitutionally to be United States citizens,

do

10 we have to reach this overbreadth argument at all?
11

MR. STEWART;

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. STEWART;

14

QUESTION:

I don't believe you do, Your Honor.

Mo.
I think that that question --

Even though it says peace officers, the

15 second question, but since the only three applicants here
16

are deputy probation officers --

17

MR.

STEWART:

That is right.

I don’t think you

18 need to reach the other argument.
19

QUESTION:

What if we held that they may be

20 excluded ?
21

MR. STEWART:

May be limited to peace officers.

I

22 think then that -23

QUESTION:

I mean, suppose we hold that the state

24 may require probation officers to be citizens?
25

MR. STEWART:

I think then that the Court need not

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

/

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 consider the overbreadth question, because in this
2 particular case the applicants were just for the deputy
3 probation officer position.

Deputy probation officers are

4 specifically declined as a precise class of peace officer in
5 the statute.

It is not a generic term.

And that the other

6 categories, if they are constitutionally defective, should
7 be addressed in a separate suit with parties withstanding,
8 and where the evidence could be developed as to the
9 particular tasks involved in that -- in those jobs.
10

In this case, the trial court, by simply saying

11 that the California statute was unconstitutionally
12 overbroad, without consideration in detail of the
13 sub-categories of peace officers, concluded

that they were

14 not legitimately restricted to citizens, and completely
15 eliminated the citizenship requirements, some of which, for
16 highway patrolman, police, and sheriff, this Court has
17 already held are legitimate qualifications.
18

QUESTION;

Well, then, Mr. Stewart, that is to

19 suggest that no matter how we come out on Question One, we
20 ought not answer Question Two.
21

MR.

STEWART:

I believe that is the position I

22 take, Your Honor.
23

QUESTION:

Yes.

24

QUESTION;

Mr. Stewart, you have three persons

25 involved here, don't you?

One of them is now a probation

I thought the briefs indicated he had

Am I wrong?

But the Court in, I believe it was a footnote in

10 their second opinion,

stated that his cause was still right

still had his claim for back pay and other

12 damages.

13

QUESTION;

What about the other two?

Have they

14 acquired citizenshp?
15

MR. STEWART;

No,

they have not, Your Honor.

Nor

16 did they indicate any intention to acquire citizenship.
17

QUESTION:

Just as a matter of information, you do

18 have some peace officers in California authorized to carry
19 arms who need not be citizens?
MR. STEWART:

I do not know whether that is a

1 Your Honor, are authorized to carry weapons in California.
2 It is up to their particular —
3

QUESTION;

That, of course, is not what it said.

4

MR. STEWART;

It is up to their particular

5 jurisdiction or the employer that allows them to carry
6 weapons.
7

In Foley and Ambach, this Court in a more precise

8 and narrow context applied its guidance in Sugarman.

In

9 Foley, the Court upheld the citizenship requirement for
10 police officers, and in Ambach for teachers.

The guestion

11 then is whether or not the job characteristics of a
12 probation officer fall on the Foley-Ambach side,

which

13 justifies citizenship.
14

Measured against the criteria the Court considered

15 in Foley and Ambach, we believe that the deputy probation
16 officer positions clearly perform significant governmental
17 functions that would justify the imposition of a citizenship
18 requirement.

This Court perhaps other than attorneys are

19 most familiar with the functions of a probation officer.
20

QUESTION;

Under California law, in practice, do

21 they give the sentencing judge a pre-sentence report?
22

MR. STEWART;

Yes, they do.

They are required to

23 provide a pre-sentence report in all cases.
24

QUESTION;

Do they recommend -- are they

25 authorized to recommend revocation of probation?

MR.

STEWART:

2 possess in California,

Yes, they are, Your Honor.

They

I believe, all of the essential

3 probation officer powers that exist in most states and in
4 the federal government.

In fact, I believe on of the amicus

5 for the Appellees indicated that there is really essentially
6 no difference in the probation officer's powers in
7 California between those exercised generally and also in the
8 federal government.

So they possess the power to --

Mr. Stewart, what is it about being a

QUESTION;

10 non-citizen, being an alien, that affects one’s ability to
11 prepare a pre-sentence report?
12

MR. STEWART;

Well, if you zeroed in on just that

13 one facet of the probation officer's functions, whether he
14 was a citizen or not may not -15

QUESTION;

Well, then, what about recommending

16 sentence as opposed to probation?
17

MR. STEWART;

I think that is a significant

18 factor, because by making that recommendation, it assumes
19 that the court will take some cognizance of it.

The

20 probation officer is exercising a soveriegn power of the
21 government, making a recommendation as to the liberty of an
22 individual,

and it forms an extremely important part of our

23 criminal justice process, which is bottomed on the concept
24 of rehabilitation.
25

QUESTION:

But do you think there is something

2

In the case of juveniles, the probation officer's

3 capacity is much broader in California, because they come
4 into contact with juveniles that may not be offenders, or
5 have not got to the stage where they would be charged with
6 some sort of criminal activity.

QUESTION;

Doyou think that is relevant?

3

MR. STEWART;

4

QUESTION;

No, I don’t, Your Honor.

Mr. Stewart, would you outline the

5 duties of a probation officer with respect to Juveniles?
6

MR. STEWART;

Yes.

The duties of a probation

7 officer with respect to juveniles can be divided into
8 perhaps two categories, those which could be considered
9 delinquents and those that could be considered to be
10 abandoned, neglected, or abused children in California.
11

As far as delinquents are concerned, they have

12 jurisdiction to determine whether or not to take a juvenile
13 into custody because of some offense, whether or not to
14 divert him into the criminal justice system or to release
15 him back to his parents or to some informal method of
16 treating the individual.

They can determine whether or not

17 charges should be filed against a juvenile.
18

The juvenile can be remanded to the custody of the

19 deputy probation officer at the determination of the
20 juvenile judge and put under a program of corrective
21 behavior and restrictions somewhat similar to conditions of
22 parole.
23

The probation officers in Los Angeles County run

24 juvenile camps, have sole jurisdiction over approximately
25 nine or ten juvenile camps in Los Angeles County.

With regard to the non-delinquent children, their

2 powers are very extensive.
3 patriae concept .

They act as sort of a parens

They can come in and seek to remove the

4 child from the custody of its parents because of abuse or
5 neglect.

Once again, the court can remand the juvenile back

6 into the custody of the probation officer to be put under a
7 program or put into his protective custody and moved into a
8 foster home, or under one of the juvenile halls, not the
9 juvenile hall in the delinquent sense, but we have a
10 juvenile hall that has children that have been abandonded or
11 neglected, and they were under the jurisdiction of the
12 probation department up until just a couple of years ago,
13 but in other counties they are still under the control of
14 the probation department.
15

QUESTION;

Isn't that all under the supervision of

16 the social worker?
17

MR. STEWART;

The only -- only the abandoned,

18 neglected, and abused child does the social worker have a
19 role, Your Honor.

21 the child from one status to another on his own?

23 child.

MR. STEWART;

I was referring to a delinquent

Where the child is adjudged to be a delinquent,

25 not have any role in that.

Here you have kind of a different approach to the

MR. STEWART*

Well, we believe we can do it,

but

4 it doesn't require that he be a -- or that citizens of the
5 United States -6

QUESTION;

Well, which you can't do.

You can't

8 exceptions?
9
10

Can there be exceptions?

MR. STEWART:
QUESTION;

No.

You have just tied your own hands in

11 this a rea.
12

MR. STEWART*

Well, what I am saying is that

13 having an alien probation officer does not in my view
14 enhance the relationship between himself and a non-alien
15 offender, that in Los Angeles County in particular there is
16a large number of citizen Spanish-speaking individuals of
17 Spanish or Hispanic background that can relate very well
18 with the criminal offenders, whether of the Spanish or other
19 race, or whether he is an alien or he is not an alien.
20

QUESTION:

I suppose in Ambach versus Norwick the

21 same argument could have been made that an alien
22 Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican might have related better to
23 students in New York schools than a citizen and nonetheless
24 we upheld the New York requirement that teachers be citizens.
25

MR. STEWART;

And I believe it would apply equally

1 well to the Foley case, because there have been efforts, of
2 course, for the police department to more adequately or more
3 broadly represent the structure of society, yet you upheld a
4 citizenship requirement for police officers, and they relate
5 as well to non-alien offenders.

I find no distinction

6 between Foley and Ambach in that regard.
7

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, does the record show how

8 many probation officers there are in the County of Los
9 Angeles?
10

MR. STEWART:

The record does not show that.

I

11 can represent to the Court what -12

QUESTION:

It is a matter of public record, isn’t

13 it?
14

MR. STEWART:

Yes, it is, and it is approximately

15 2,500.
16

QUESTION:

Twenty-five hundred?

Do you have any

17 idea what percentage of those are Spanish-speaking citizens?
18

MR. STEWART:

I believe that the percentage of

19 them are approximately, and this is a guess, in the vicinity
20 of 20 percent, 15 to 20 percent.
21

QUESTION:

I suppose a guess would not be very

22 helpful for us unless counsel on the other side would agree.
23

MR. STEWART:

Yes, I understand, Your Honor, but

24 there is nothing in the record indicating that.

I can

25 represent that the county does have the Spanish-speaking

I may be wrong, but I believe that they did.
QUESTION:

Well, administrative exceptions can be

3 made, can they not, in the federal government to employ
4 aliens?
5

ME. STEWART*

I am sure that there can, Your

6 Honor, yes.
7

QUESTION*

If the convicted criminal has any

8 rights in the area, is there anything to the notion that an
9 American citizen might think he had some right to have a
10 probation officer supervising him or advising the court
11 about him who was not an alien citizen of another country?
12 Do you think the criminal defendants have any rights in the
13 matter?
14

MR. STEWART*

I don’t think the criminal

15 defendants have a right to a particular type of probation
16 officer.

I think that is up to the court and the probation

17 authorities to determine the best qualified probation
18 officer without regard to whether he is an alien or not an
19 alien.
20

I have emphasized the power of the probation

21 officer with regard to the criminal justice system, but it
22 is clear that in that exercise of power they exert or
23 execute vast discretionary powers, not only with the
24 pre-sentencing report and recommendations to the court.
25 They act in a quasi-judicia 1 capacity and have been held to

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 act in that capacity and are entitled to immunity as a judge
2 would be for acting in a quasi-judicial capacity.
3

They also possess peace officer status, and while

4 it is not exercised to the same extent as a policeman, they
5 can exercise a peace officer status and take a probationer
6 who has violated probation into custody.

They exercise vast

7 discretion in determining whether or not a condition of
8 parole has been violated, and if it has, what should be the
9 disposition.

It does not necessarily follow that he will

10 automati cally request a revocation of parole.
11

I think just by virtue of the extensive, expansive

12 authority of a probation officer over juveniles, that Itself
13 would be sufficient to justify the imposition of a
14 citizenshpi requirement.

They are clearly when you review

15 their entire functions not mere functionaries, but they form
16 the core of the state’s philosophy regarding rehabilitation
17 of criminals.
18

As the crime rate increases, the function of a

19 probation officer becomes more and more important.

As the

20 ABA announced or stated in their report on probation, that
21 it is one of the central features of our criminal justice
22 system, and more and more the courts have come to rely on
23 probationers, probation officers.

As such, they certainly

24 execute a significant and important governmental function,
25 in my view far expanding in many respects that of a police

Very well

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARY S. BURDICK, ESQ./
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MS. BURDICK;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

8 the Court, the state of California by enactment of one
9 simple single section of California law. Government Code
10 Section 1031(A), in one fell swoop has banned over one and
11 one-third million legally admitted resident aliens of
12 California from employment in more than 70 different job
13 categories, regardless of whether those aliens are seeking
14 to become citizens.
15

The jobs from which aliens are excluded include

16 deputy probation officers, the positions which the
17 plaintiffs in this case sought, as well as such jobs as
18 inspectors for specialized boards, such as the boards of
19 dental examiners -20

QUESTION;

Are we really concerned with anything

21 except probation officers here?
22

MS. BURDICK;

Yes, I believe we are.

The

23 probation officers were prevented from obtaining employment
24 by a statute which sweeps too broadly and which does not
25 comply with the mandate of Sugarman that a statute which

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 limits constitutional rights if challenged under the
2 Fourteenth Amendment must be narrowly drawn and precisely
3 crafted in light of the state's interest.
4

QUESTION;

I thought overbreadth was limited to

5 freedom of speech.
6

MS. BURDICK;

Well, not necessarily.

Of course,

7 in Sugarman, the Court struck down the statute and said it
8 was not precisely crafted and narrowly drawn.
9

QUESTION;

Well,

I am probably a poor person to

10 interpret Sugarman since Idissented in that case, but

as I

11 read it, it simply said that the state could have excluded
12 certain jobs from aliens but that it simply swept with too
13 broad a brush substantively rather than having conduct which
14 might have been proscribed get off free because you couldn't
15 tell what it meant.
16

MS. BURDICK;

Well, I don't think that Sugarman

17 indicated that the Court was unable to decide which job
18classifications were limiited to citizens.
19 that, and gave examples of

The Court said

jobs that the jobs were too many

20 and that the statutes swept too

broadly, and therefore was

21 not precisely crafted, and that is exactly what we have
22 here, a statute —
23

QUESTION;

But, Ms. Burdick, if we agreed that as

24 applied to deputy probation officers the statute was
25 unconstitutional, do we have to go on and deal with the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 overbreadth issue at all?
2

MS. BURDICK;

You would not have to in order to

3 resolve the case of the three plaintiffs.

However, this

4 Court would be using a prudential limit on standing, not a
5 strict standing requirement to do so, and that would lead to
6 the very unprudential result which the county has urged that
7 we have 69 more cases to decide about the rest of the
8 statute.
9

Now, if we were suggesting that none of the

10 positions in this statute could ever be limited to citizens,
11 then I would agree that this is an incorrect vehicle.
12

QUESTION;

13

MS. BURDICK :

14

QUESTION;

This isn’t a class action, is it?
No, it is no t.

Well, are you suggesting that it is

15 time this Court fishes or cuts bait on the question of
16 whether or not alienage may be required, or may be
17 prohibited by a state in state employment, that it come to
18 rest somewhere or other rather than deciding each case on an
19 ad hoc basis?
20

MS. BURDICK;

Well, the Court has clearly

21 indicated that in some job positions aliens may be excluded,
22 but I think, yes, this is a case where there is an
23 opportunity to draw the line, and to establish some criteria
24 so that the cases do not have to be resolved one at a time
25 without any standards.

QUESTION:

Do you think Judge Hill tried very hard

MS. BURDICK:

Well, as the court noted below,

4 Judge Hill and the other two judges on the panel had been
5 California state trial judges.
6a probation officer does.

They were familiar with what

They said in their opinion that

7 they considered Foley, they considered Ambach.

I have to

8 believe that they did so.
9
10

QUESTION:

And they divided two to one.

MS. BURDICK:

They divided two to one.

That is

11 correct.
12

QUESTION:

Ms. Burdick, going back to Justice

13 White's inquiry, was there a reason why this wasn't brought
14 as a class action?
15

MS. BURDICK:

What is reflected in the record is

16 that a first amended complaint was proposed to make this a
17 class action.

What is not reflected in the record is that

18 the Court urged the parties to stipulate that it did not
19 have to be a class action because the Court believed it
20 could reach the overbreadth issue.
21

There is then a stipulation in the record that the

22 parties would drop the class allegations from the complaint
23 and would proceed with the action.

However, the county did

24 agree to apply the decision to all probation officers,
25 deputy probation officers in the stipulation, whether they

18 anyone.

to

That still leaves the legislature in the position

19 of being able to go back and do what it could

have done

20 before,

and that is examine each peace officer position and

21 require

citizenship for those where it feels it is

22 appropriate.
23

QUESTION:

24 already asked,

Maybe this is what Justice White

but whatever reason the legislature had for

25 requiring citizenship for probation officers must also apply

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to everybody else thrown into this statute, such as cemetery
2 sextons and the like.

They didn’t say, well, there is a

3 special — they didn't separate this, probation officers,
4 out from the others, and whatever the reason was must be
5 common to the entire group covered by the statute.

Is that

6 your argument ?
7

MS. BURDICK:

That is correct.

When the

8 California attorney general a decade ago examined this
9 statute, he opined that it was unconstitutional, examined
10 the legislative history, and said he could find no reason
11 for a broad sweeping citizenship requirement.

The

12 citizenship requirement is not contained in a statute which
13 says, probation officers must be citizens, and a separate
14 one that says investigators for the board of dental quality
15 assurance must be citizens.
16

What we had was one statute enacted that said

17 peace officers must be citizens.

The definition of peace

18 officer is contained scattered throughout other parts of
19 California law, has evolved over the years, and there has
20 never been any attempt to attach a citizenship requirement
21 individually to the job categories.

The legislature acted

22 with a broad brush.
23

QUESTION:

And yet you concede, do you not, that

24 you represent only three people here and each of them are
25 applicants for the position of probation officer.

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

MS. BURDICK:
2

QUESTION:

Yes, that's correct

The Attorney General's opinion was way

3 back in 1970, wasn't it?
4

MS. BURDICK:

5

QUESTION;

Yes, it was.

That would be before Foley and Norwick ,

6 Ambach.
7

MS. BURDICK:

That's correct.

The Attorney

8 General of California anticipated Sugarman, Foley, and
9Ambach, in his opinion, indicated that under current law
10 even before those decisions the statute violated the
11 Fourteenth Amendment, but even after the Attorney General's
12 opinion and this Court's decisions, at least the county of
13 Los Angeles in California has continued to enforce the
14 statute.
15

QUESTION:

Has the Attorney General appeared in

16 this litigation at all?
17

MS. BURDICK:

18

QUESTION:

No.

And yet it is his duty to defend the

19 statute under California law, or not?

Is that to be imposed

20 on the county officials?
21

MS. BURDICK:

The only obligation that I know of

22 to involve the Attorney General is under this Court's rules
23 to send him the required notice of the case.

He does not

24 have any obligation that I know of under California law to
25 appear.

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

This case offers an excellent opportunity for the

2

Court to set some criteria and develop a way to draw lines

3

in future cases where public employees are excluded if they

4

are not citizens.

5

may help give some meaning to the language of Sugarman,

6

Foley, and Connelie.

7

I offer and suggest three criteria which

This language -- these criteria can be used to

8

evaluate jobs that are policy implementation jobs,

9

non-elective, non-appointive, and I believe that these will

10

give some substance to the language of this Court's opinions

11

that require that the public be substantially affected by

12

jobs which are limited to citizens, and that those jobs lie

13

at the heart of representative government.

14

My first suggestion is that we inquire whether

15

public employees have an important public power which puts

16

them in a position of authority and control over a

17

substantial portion of the citizen population.

18

My second suggested criteria is that we ask if

19

there is any way in which the citizen government buffers the

20

contact between the population in general and the public

21

employee, either by screening the clientele of the public

22

employee or by interposing some direct supervisor.

23

QUESTION;

On your first criteria, Ms. Burdick, do

24

you mean all the people of California, all the people of Los

25

Angeles County, or all the persons criminally convicted in

12 geographical

jurisdiction, be subject to authority and

The constituency of the probation

Probation officers don’t deal with the

Now, their contacts with other people

23 defendants.

Is that so?

24

MS. BURDICK:

25

QUESTION;

That’s correct.

Did I correctly understand Mr. Stewart

32

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to say they have 2,500 probation officers?
2

MS. BUBDICK«

I have no information and there is

3

no information in the record as to the total number of

4

probation officers.

5

On that first criteria, as you pointed out, the

6 probation officer deals with a very small population.
7

amicus Service Employees Union has offered data which can be

8 found at their Footnote 4 and
9

11 and the accompanying text

that indicates that one-tenth of 1 percent of the California

10

population comes under the jurisdiction of a probation

11

officer.

12

13
14

The

My second suggested criteria was whether there was
a buffer between the public and the public employee.
My third suggestion is that we ask if the public

15

employee holds a position which has some symbolic importance

16

in the public mind in terms of what the public would

17

perceive as the meaning of the power and authority of the

18

government to control and to assimilate the general

19

population.

20

If we apply these criteria to the probation

21

officer functions, I think we will see that there is a

22

distinct difference between a probation officer on the one

23

hand and public employees such as police officers and

24

teachers on the other.

25

QUESTION;

But when you speak of the public.

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 certainly the public speaks through the legislature, does it
2 not ?
3

MS. BURDICK;

Yes, and it is the legislature which

4 I would suggest is the entity which is properly limited to
5 citizens.

It is the legislature which would control the

6 authority of the court, the court which in turn would
7 control the authority of the probation officer.

The

8 probation officer is very much screened out from the
9 political process by the time a small portion of the
10 population comes under his control.
11

QUESTION;

But when the legislature says that a

12 probation officer must be a citizen, doesn't that mean that
13 the public perceives that the probation officer ought to be
14 a citizen?
15
16

MS. BURDICK;

I don't know if that is true.

In

this case, the legislature said all peace officers shall be

17 citizens.

What they had in mind at the time they enacted

18 that statute as to what a peace officer might be, I don't
19 know, but if it is true that there has been a reasoned
20 legislative decision here, then there has been a reasoned
21 legislative decision that messengers have to be citizens,
22 too, and I think at some point the Court has to go behind
23 that decision to see whether it violates the Fourteenth
24 Amendmen t.
25

QUESTION;

Well, we don't ordinarily require that

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 all state legislative or for that matter Congressional
2 decisions be "reasoned", do we?
3

KS. BURDICK:

No, but when there is a challenge

4 under the Fourteenth Amendment, particularly when a discrete
5 and insular minority such as aliens is involved, this Court
6 has required that there be a compelling justification for
7 the classification.
8

If I may apply my criteria to the jobs performed

9 by a probation officer, I think we will see the distinction
10 bet
between
we en a probation officer on one hand and a teacher or a
11 pol icema

on the other.

Mr. Stewart tells me

24

QUESTION;

He does have to be.

QUESTION;

Ms. Burdick, could I - - suppose this

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 statute that is here in Section 1 said all school teachers
2 must be citizens, and Section 2, all policemen must be
3 citizens, Section 3, all other peace officers must be
4 citizens, and then the definition of police officer is just
5 as it is in this case, and suppose your clients were either
6 applicants for police positions or as teachers.
7

MS. BURDICK:

8

QUESTION:

If you --

Do you think you would be here making

9 the same argument, that because the statute is so broad, it
10 may not be applied to teachers or police officers?
11

MS. BURDICK:

I think if there were a statute that

12 said police -13

QUESTION:

Kell,

this is the very statute here.

14 The only difference is that the first two sections apply to
15 teachers and police officers, and your clients are some of
16 those people.

MS. BURDICK:

18 to raise that issue.

I believe that I would have standing
However, for prudential reasons, the

19 Court might find that I would not have enough of a stake in
20 the case and would not be raising it in the proper context,
21 that it would be an inappropriate case to decide the full
22 breadth .
23

QUESTION;

Well, what if we decide that probation

24 officers are more like police officers?

And that if the

25 only section there was in the statute dealt with probation

37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 officers, you would lose.

Do you think you should win

2 because the statute applies to some other positions?
3

MS. BURDICK:

I think in this case, yes, we should

4 be able to prevail as the three-judge court below found on
5 the issue that this statute was not carefully crafted by the
6 legislature in light of the legislature's legitimate
7 interest in protecting the political community.

That would

8 still leave the California legislature free to go back and
9 enact a narrow statute which applied only to the categories
10 this Court found appropriately limited to citizens.
11

QUESTION*

Supposing the legislature did go back

12 and craft, as you say, a narrowly drawn statute that said
13 all probation officers must be citizens.

Would you feel

14 that was constitutional or unconstitutional?
15

NS. BURDICK:

That would be unconstitutional,

16 because I do not believe that probation officers properly
17 fall within the political community and are similar to
18 police officers and teachers.

I believe the probation

19 officer performs more one of the common occupations.
20

QUESTION:

Well, so then you really don't need the

21 overbreadth argument at all, do you?
22

MS. BURDICK:

No.

As I indicated, we could win if

23 this Court only ruled that probation officers cannot be
24 required to be citizens.

However, it would then be in the

25 posture that perhaps 69 more cases would be necessary to

MS. BURDICK;

Yes.

Ms. Burdick, do you think the Court

10 these cases?

MS. BURDICK:

14 requirements.

Is there a distinction in the facts,

relevant it may or may not be, between this case and
in that your people were willing to take a loyalty

22 oath and

23

Ms. Burdick, let me ask you one thing.

those in Ambach did not go that far?
MS. BURDICK:

I had thought that the plaintiffs in

24 both Foley and Ambach had indicated their willingness to
25 sign the pre-employment loyalty oath.

QUESTION;

But in any event, yours are willing?

2

MS. BURDICK;

Ours are all willing, and Mr.

3Chavez-Salido, in fact, had his petition for naturalization
4 pending when he applied for employment and was still denied
5 employment.
6

If I apply the criteria that I have suggested to

7 the job of probation officer, I would note that a probation
8 officer does not perform important functions which put him
9 in a position of power and authority over a substantial
As I noted, they deal with

11 approximately one-tenth of 1 percent of the population.
12 They have control of that percentage of the population only
13 during the period of probation, and their contact during
14 that period is intermittent.

QUESTION;

15
161

percent?

How did you arrive at that one-tenth of

I missed your calculation.

17

MS. BURDICK;

18

QUESTION;

The figures came from the—

Population of Los Angeles County?

Are

19 you starting with that?
20

MS. BURDICK;

I took -- the figures are from

21 Footnotes 4 and 11 of the amicus brief of the Service
22 Employees Union, and the figure was 23 million Californians
23 and 23,000 probationers.
24

QUESTION;

Does the record show the total number

25 of persons in confinement in California then?

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MS. BURDICK:

2

If we compare then the police officer and the

3

teacher, we see that a police officer has authority and

4

power to intervene in the life of any citizen during the

5

entire life of that citizen.

No, it does not.

A teacher has power and

6 authority over substantially all citizens for at least ten
7

to twelve years of their lives, and for substantial periods

8 of time during those ten to twelve years.
9

QUESTION:

Well, that is not true of a student at

10

a private school, nor is it true of a police officer if he

11

makes a warrant, unjustified, warrantless arrest, is it?

12

MS. BURDICK:

I can see that public school

13

teachers deal with probably 85 to 90 percent of the

14

population.

15

to meet my first criteria.

I consider that a substantial enough proportion
It is also true, of course, that

16 a policeman can only intervene with one person at a time,
17

and that his decision to do so may eventually be found to

18

have been in error.

19

authority to make the decision on the spot in his own

However, the policeman has the

20 discretion whether to intervene with any citizen at any
21

time.

The supervision and the oversight of that decision

22 comes afterwards,

and then it is by the court.

QUESTION:

23

Well, don’t you think that supervision

24

and oversight also comes from his lieutentant and his

25

captain ?

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MS. BURDICK:

Yes, it does, but at the moment of

2intervention, the police have the exercise of their own
3 personal understanding of their job and their obligation as
4 their only guidance.

There is no direct supervisor walking

5 with the policeman on a beat.
6

QUESTION:

Well, how about the probation officer

7 who decides to suspend probation or to hold the first of th<
8 Morrissey versus Brewer hearings?

Doesn't he have the

9 initial right to make a determination that there is grounds
10 for holding the second type of hearing on his own?
11

MS. BURDICK:

In California, a probation officer

12 cannot alter or revoke, make any changes in probation at
13 all .

He can merely bring the issue before the judge, where

14 the judge makes that decision.
15

QUESTION:

But he has the right to institute the

16 proceeding, doesn’t he?
17

MS. BURDICK:

Yes, he can suggest to

18 that a change should be made, but only the cour
19 that change.

Therefore, again, he acts as an a

20 bringing issues to the court, but not as the ultimate
21 decision maker.
22

My second criteria was that we look to see if

23 there is some buffer between the general population and the
24 public official, either by the intervention of a supervisor
25 or by screening of the clientele of the public officer.

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

It

1 is the police, the judges, and the juries who winnow out the
2 general population and find that narrow group which should
3 be under the control of a probation officer.
4

I would suggest that it is then the police, the

5 judges, and the juries who exercise the role of government
6 in the criminal justice system, and that they simply pass on
7 to the probation officer a very small class of people in
8 need of limited supervision under set terms and conditions
9 for a short period of time.
10

On the other hand, as I have already suggested,

11 the police come in direct contact with the general public,
12 and teachers come in direct contact with all of the general
13 public.

There is no intervention, and there is no

14 supervisor.
15

My third criteria was that there be some symbolic

16 importance in the job in order to give meaning to the
17 context of what we believe lies at the heart of our
18 representative government.

Police and school teachers are

19 constant, pervasive symbols of what it means to be under the
20 control and authority and the assimilative forces of our
21 society.

A probation officer is an important employee, but

22 he is not a symbolic functionary of government.
23

QUESTION;

Isn’t a probation officer an arm of the

24 sentencing judge in California?
25

MS. BURDICK;

Well, he is an advisor to and is

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 present in court, but I don’t think that he rises to the
2 same importance in terms of symbolism as the judge or the
3 jury.
4

QUESTION:

What do you think the probationer or

5 parolee thinks when the probation officer comes around to
6 have a chat with him?

Does he think that had something to

7 do with the Judge?
8

MS. BURDICK:

He certainly understands that the

9 probation officer is following the instructions of the
10 judge, but I don't think that he has the same reaction to
11 the probation officer who is an employee in an office that
12 he would have to the armed police officer or to the judge
13 behind the bench.
14

QUESTION:

Are the probation officers in

15 California permitted to carry arms under some circumstances
16 by administrative leave?
17

MS. BURDICK:

Only if their employing authority

18 authorizes it, and to the best of my knowledge, and as far
19 as the record reflects, no such authorization has been given
20 in Los Angeles.
21

QUESTION:

Ms. Burdick, do they wear uniforms?

22

MS. BURDICK:

23

In short, a probation officer, like a teacher or a

I believe they do not.

24 policeman, is an advisor, not a decision-maker.

He deals

25 with a very small, carefully screened portion of the

MR. STEWART;

The

10 officers?
11

QUESTION;

12

MR. STEWART;

Yes, sir.
Yes, they are appointed by the chief

13 probation officer, and based upon a competitive civil
14 service list.
15

I agree with the Appellees that some lines should

16 be drawn, but I believe that the lines drawn by the
17 Appellees are too narrow and inappropriate for this
18 particular job function.

Probation officers advise their

19 juveniles of constitutional rights.

Moreover, if they act

20 as legal advisors to juveniles, they act as a public legal
21 advisor, in a sense, and this Court, while it held that
22citizenship could not be required of private attorneys, the
23 Court has not had the opportunity to consider whether or not
24 citizenship could be required of public counsel.
25

Now, judges and prosecutors also have somewhat

U6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 limited contact, yet as an integral part of the criminal
2 justice system, of which the probation officer is a part,
3 they can legitimately be required to be citizens.

I believe

4 that the Appellees have failed to articulate any viable
5 reason as to why probation officers should be excluded from
6 that team of judge, prosecutor, and police officer, and
7 could not be limited to citizens.
8

QUESTION:

Incidentally,

Mr. Stewart,

I know

it is

9 not germane, but do you know whether there is any
10 constitutional or statutory provision that requires a member
11 of this Court to be an American citizen?
12

MR. STEWART;

I don't know, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION;

Or even a lawyer?

14

QUESTION;

I don't think

you will find it.

15

QUESTION;

Well, perhaps

the question is, could

16 Congress pass a statute requiring members of the federal
17 judiciary to be citizens of the United States?
18

MR. STEWART;

I believe they could, Your Honor.

I

19 believe they could, and I believe California could pass a
20 statute that requires their police officers and their
21 probation officers and their judges and their prosecutors to
22 be citizens as well, because I think the standard here is
23 too narrow that they have articulated, but it is whether or
24 not the individual has been given or cloaked with some
25 aspect of the sovereign power of the state.

This Court has

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

said that the states should be given broad power to

2

structure their political community, and I think probation

officers clearly fall within that political community.

exercise a sovereign --

But isn’t it true that everybody who

I don't believe so, Your Honor.

There are jobs that are government employment, but there are

10

other jobs, and we make this distinction in municipal law

11

between a governmental officer who exercises a sovereign

12

power

13

QUESTION:

You would differentiate between the

14

governmental functions and the proprietary functions, is

15

your basic distinction.

16

MR. STEWART:

Yes, between the type of employment

such as a clerk typist or an engineer or an accountant who

18

may work with the government or he may work outside the

government.

QUESTION;

I have yet to run across a bureaucrat

10 of the federal or state government who wasn't the very
11 epitome of all authority in government.
12

MR. STEWART;

Have you?

Well, I would like to be a little

13 more modest than that, Your Honor.

We do draw a

14 distinction, though, in civil law between a governmental
15 employee and one who is a governmental officer in the sense
16 of possessing and exercising sovereign powers, and here, the
17 state of California has conditioned a grant of some of their
18 sovereign powers upon citizenship, in a bond that is simply
19 an oath will not suffice.

If an oath would suffice, then

20 why even require citizenship?

You have done away with the

21 requirement of citizenship if someone merely can give an
22 oath to uphold the Constitution or to obey the law in lieu
23 of citizenship.
24

QUESTION;

Mr. Stewart, some time ago Justice

25 O'Connor asked you kind of a double question, and I think

49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 you didn't get back to the first one.

Are you persuaded at

2 all by this theory of pre-emption that some of the academics
3 have advanced in this area?
♦

4

MR. STEWART;

No, I do not, because that same

5 point could have been made in Foley and Ambach, and the
6 Court was not concerned about pre-emption in those two
7 cases, and I think by virtue of the Court's -8

QUESTION:

Did you say the point was made or could

9 have been made?
10

MR. STEWART:

Well, I don't believe that the

11 decision in Ambach or Foley or Sugarman turned on federal
12 pre-emption.

The Court, when it articulated the standards

13 that the states had broad power to define their political
14 community and applied that then to the conext of Foley and
15 Ambach, did not say that they were pre-empted from that in
16 terms of citizenship because of the federal jurisdiction.
17

QUESTION:

No, but I think the point of the

18 professorial comments is that this is the way out of this
19 wilderness, and line drawing, and the like, to adopt a
20 theory of pre-emption.

You wouldn't like that, of course.

21

No, Your Honor.

MR. STEWART:

I would recommend

22 that we look more at the exercise of the sovereign powers as
23a way to draw the line rather than just simply take away
24 completely the state's power to require citizenship.
25

QUESTION:

Thank you, counsel.
