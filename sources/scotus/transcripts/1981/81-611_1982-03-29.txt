Mr. McHugh, I think you may proceed whenever

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES F. McHUGH, III, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. McHUGH:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the Appellant in this case is the

10

Globe Newspaper Company, publisher of a newspaper called

11

The Boston Globe, which is circulated in the city of

12

Boston and elsewhere throughout New England.

13

here today to seek reversal of a judgment of the Supreme

14

Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

15

holding that a Massachusetts statute, General Laws,

16

Chapter 268, Section 16(A), on its face and as applied

17

to the facts of this case constitutes a permissible

18

method for regulating the trial of certain criminal

19

cases .

20
21

We are

In essence, the statute provides that at the
trial of cases involving crimes of sex, the court is

22 required to exclude the press and the public from the
23
24
25

courtroom while the minor victim —
QUESTION;

Do you mean, Mr. McHugh, by

required, the fact it is mandated, that no matter what

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the witnesses may desire, and what the parties may
2 desire, the court must close the courtroom?
3

MR. McHUGHj

Precisely, Mr. Justice.

4 exactly what the statute says.

That is

That is exactly how the

5 Supreme Judicial Court has construed it to read.
6

QUESTION;

Then, I am a little puzzled when

7 you reach the proposition you advance that you — it is
8 not only bad on its face but as applied.
9

MR. McHUGH;

10
11

QUESTION;

Hell, if —
Now, as applied here, you say that

even if the statute were discretionary, you would be

12 here.
13

MR. McHUGH;

He would be here on this record.

14 Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.
15

QUESTION;

I notice in your brief you suggest

16 that there was no question raised by the complaining
17 witness.

Do you think that is quite an accurate

18 characterization of the complaining witness?
19

MR. McHUGH;

At the time the closure order was

20 entered, there surely was no question raised by the
21 complaining witness.
22

At the time —

QUESTION;

What was the complaining witness’s

23 position about the matter?
24

MR. McHUGH;

It is unclear to me, Mr. Chief

25 Justice, and I think that —

QUESTION

I thought it was pretty clear that

2 if her privacy could be guaranteed, then she would have
3

no objection.

4

any other way than what was done here?

5

Now, could her privacy be guaranteed in

MR. McHUGH:

Well, I don't think her privacy

6 could be guaranteed by what was done here if by privacy
7

we mean disclosure of potentially embarrassing facts,

8 because this statute doesn't reach the problem that is
9

covered by that kind of a situation.

Beyond that, I am

10

not sure from what I described as an uninformative, and

11

I think it is an uninformative colloquy that took place

12

in chambers after these orders were entered, precisely

13

what her concerns about privacy were.

14

After all, that colloquy dealt with the

15

prosecutor's representation to the court concerning what

16

the victim them had said to her, the prosecutor.

17

that, at the time the hearing took place before a single

18

justice, the representation was that the prosecutor had

19

consulted fully with the victims, and that literally on

Before

20 their behalf the Commonwealth was waiving whatever
21

22

rights it had under the statute.
At most, I would suggest, Mr. Chief Justice,

23

that that colloquy and its dimensions illustrate the

24

critical need for a hearing in cases like this, so that

25

questions like the one you have just asked can be

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 answered on some kind of a factual record which lets
2 people know precisely what is going on and what the
3 precise concerns of the victim are.
4

QUESTION;

Yes, but I understood, Mr. McHugh,

5 in your answer to me, it would not — what was the need
6 for a hearing?

As I understood it, the trial judge,

7 under the statute, if he is to follow it, has absolutely
8 no choice.
9
10

He has to close the courtroom.
MR. McHUGH:
QUESTION:

I agree, and that —
I mean, he has to ask reporters, he

11 has to ask the public, he has to ask everyone to get out
12 except the parties.
13

Isn't that right?

MR. McHUGH:

That's correct, Mr. Justice, but

14 — and I am not quarreling with that — with what the
15 Supreme Judicial Court says.
•

That is a reason in our

/

16 judgment, and we suggest strongly to you that this
17 statute is invalid, and in response to the Chief
18 Justice's questions, I was suggesting that this kind of
19 colloquy and the kinds of problems that are demonstrated
20 by that kind of colloquy illustrate the need for a
21 hearing before some kind of an order of closure can be
22 entered.
23

QUESTION:

This statute accordingly is

24 unconstitutional because it makes no provision for such
25 a hearing.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. McHUGH:

2

QUESTION*

That’s correct.
Suppose he had held a hearing, and

3

explored whatever anyone wanted to explore within

4

reason, and then said, in case anyone thinks this

5

statute is unconstitutional, as being overbroad, I now

6 address the question of whether I would — what I would
7

do if I read the statute as giving me discretion, and

8 under that discretion I would exclude all persons during
9
10

this particular component, section of the trial.
you still be here?
MR. McHUGHj

11

12

I would if that is all we had,

Mr. Chief Justice, because I think —
QUESTION:

13
14

Would

So even with discretion, you would

challenge.
MR. McHUGH*

15

On this record, I would challenge

16

that.

Yes, I would, and I think that the reason for

17

challenging it is that, given the fact that there is, as

18

this Court two terms ago said there was, a First

19

Amendment right to attend, then something more than the

20

desire of the victim, standing alone, or a private

21

session has to be demonstrated before the presumptive

22 right of the public to attend can be overborne.

Any

23

other view of the matter puts the extent of the press *s

24

and the public’s First Amendment rights wholly in the

25

hands of someone else, and it seems to me that that is

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 not what this Court has ever interpreted the First
2 Amendment to do.
3

QUESTION;

Well, in the case you are referring

4 to, did we not suggest that the right is the right of
5 the public, and the press included as a component of the
6 public.
7

ME. McHUGH;

Well, I'm not making any

8 differentiation here between the right of the press and
9 the right of the public.

I am content to rest on the

10 rights of the public, but surely the press as a member
11 of the public has no fewer rights under the First

12 Amendment than does the public.
13

QUESTION;

As a practical matter, Mr. McHugh,

14 if you are going to preserve the interests that the
15 Commonwealth seeks to preserve here, isn’t it either a
16 flat rule or no rule -17

MR. McHUGH;

18

QUESTION:

No, I don't —
— because if you are going to

19 obtain testimony from witnesses in situations like this,

20 isn't the prosecutor going to have to offer them some
21 assurance at the outset that their testimony will be not
22 exposed to the public?
23

MR. McHUGH;

Well, it seems to me, Mr. Justice

24 Rehnquist, that you cannot simply achieve, if I
25 understand what the statute is aimed at, a flat rule

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

that simply excludes the public from the courtroom

2 during the victim's testimony.

In order to achieve the

3

interests that the Commonwealth apparently seeks to

4

achieve, as I understand those interests, one would in

5

effect have to have a uniform rule closing virtually the

6 entirety of these trials, because if we look at what
7

those interests are, at least as I understand them, it

8 seems to me that the predominant interest is an interest
9
10

in privacy of some kind.
Now, I question whether privacy really is a

11

relevant concept when we are talking about this kind of

12

a proceeding, a criminal proceeding, but assuming that

13

it is, and if we further look at what is inherent in the

14

notion of privacy, we come to the conclusion that what

15

is involved, what the Commonwealth is attempting to

16

protect, is some restriction on the dissemination of

17

potentially embarrassing facts, and that is the element

18

of privacy that we are talking about.

19

QUESTION i

The facts that might not be given

20 in evidence were it not for some sort of protection.
21

MR. McHUGH:

But — might not be given in

22 evidence by the victim —
23

QUESTION.-

24

MR. McHUGH:

25

Right.
— conceivably, but surely even

if given by the victim, are very likely also going to be

1

given by other witnesses during the course of the trial,

2 and —
3

QUESTION:

Do you think that is realistic,

4

counsel, in crimes of rape of children or sexual abuse?

5

They don't usually occur in the presence of other

6 witnesses -7

MR. McHUGH:

8

QUESTION:

No.
— and the problem, of course, is

9

trying to make sure that the state as a policy doesn't

10

discourage victims of these crimes from coming forward

11

in the first place and making a complaint simply because

12 of the trauma that they will go through if forced to
13

testify in public about it.

14

those interests?

15

you balance those interests?

16

Now, how do you balance

I mean, as a practical matter, how do

MR. McHUGH:

Hell, as a practical matter, it

17

seems to me one has to start first with what the statute

18

does and what it doesn't do, and if one looks at that

19

distinction, one finds that this is a statute in which

20 the names of the victims are part of the public record.
21

They were in this case.

22

QUESTION:

Right.

23

MR. McHUGH:

In which the rest of the trial is

24

presumptively open, so that any reports given by the

25

victim to police officers, doctors, mothers, fathers

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

friends, and others, are going to be presumptively part

2 of the public trial, in which a transcript is
3

presumptively going to be available to the public at

4

some point, assuming that a transcript some time is

5

prepared.

6
7

QUESTION;

You make a good bit of to do about

encouraging victims to come forward.

Is there any

8 empirical evidence by way of study that supports that
9
10

11
12

kind of a statement?
MR. McHUGH;

That this statute encourages

victims to come forward?
QUESTION;

That in fact a statute of this kind

13

does encourage victims to come forth.

14

any empirical study to that effect?

15
16
17
18
19

MR. McHUGH;

Has there been

Not of which I am aware, and it

seem to me that this is really a leap of faith.
QUESTION;

How long has this statute been on

the books, Mr. McHugh?
MR. McHUGH;

It has been on the books, Mr.

20 Justice, since 1931, in its present form.
21

QUESTION;

That means that for this kind of

22 crime, then, there has never been an open trial in
23
24
25

Massachusetts?
MR. McHUGH;

No, it does not.

There are

really — There is not a sigificant amount of empirical

WASHINGTON n O 90G9A t'JnO'i RS4-93AR

1 data, survey data, if you will, but we do have some
2 clues.

We have a clue — One clue is a case called

3 Commonwealth versus Blondin, which is cited in the
4 briefs, and which was cited in a footnote in Mr. Justice
5 Blackmun’s dissent in Gannett, which was really the
6 first case to construe this statute, in the mid-forties,
7 and that was a statute — that was a case which put the
8 question whether this statute was constitutional, and in
9 that case, while deciding that it was constitutional, A,
10 because this Court had not yet decided that the Sixth
11 Amendment applied to the states through

the Fourteenth,

12 and B, because there is no public trial guarantee in the
13 Massachusetts constitution, the court was -- the Supreme
14 Judicial Court observed that from the trial of that case
15 the press had not been excluded, and went on to raise
16 the question whether indeed the press could be excluded
17 under any constitutional provisions that applied.

18

QUESTION*

Of course, this applies only where

19 there is a minor under

18 years of age who is the victim?

20

HE» McHUGH*

That is correct.

21

QUESTIONS

So that there is at least that

22 distinction.
23

HR. McHUGH*

24

QUESTION*

No, that —
Trials of victims over 18 are open

25 to the public, are they?

5 which has been tested.

QUESTION:

So it really — you are really

9 saying that unles the defense and the prosecution and
10 the judge agree.
11

MR. McHUGHi

That's correct, on the face of

12 the statute.
13

QUESTION:

But neither the public nor the

14 press would be consulted in that —
15

MR. McHUGHi

Well, Mr. Justice, that statute

16 is one which says that the judge may close the trial.

It does not, like this statute,

Mr. McHugh, if the procedure

1 these cases can be handled without even

without ever

2 getting to that particular problem which posed a
3 particular concern, understandably, I think, for the
4 Supreme Judicial Court, and it seems to me that the mode
5 of proceeding with respect to these kinds of hearings
6 could well take the form which only rarely, if ever, got
7 to examination and cross examination of the victim by
8 anybody.
9

It seems to me that a hearing of the type that

10 would suffice in most cases would require, first of all,
11 that somebody move for a concrete reason that the

12 hearing be closed, rather than simply presuming from the
13 outset that that is what is going to happen, and
14 secondly, that somebody demonstrate and articulate some
15 concrete reason, based on the evidence that is expected
16 to be presented, type of crime that is involved, the age
17 and maturity of the victim, the victim's prior ability
18 to deal with —
19

QUESTION?

Well, supposing the prosecutor

20 comes in and moves just what you said, that this is a
21 15-year-old girl who is going to testify that she has
22 been raped, and she is unwilling to testify unless there
23 can be some exclusion of the public and the press at the
24 time she testifies.

unlikely that in any case of — imaginable that the vast

2

QUESTION;

Maybe not the vast majority, but

3 let's say 100 of them asked to come in.
4

MR. McHUGH;

All right, let's even take a

5 substantial group, Mr. Chief Justice.

It seems to me

6 that that problem, too, can be handled the way all kinds
7 of class action problems are handled and other kinds of
8 problems are handled.

You appoint lead counsel,

9 somebody to ask the questions to the judge which are
10 going to be put to the victim.
11

We're not suggesting here, and I don't think

12 we ever have suggested that this preliminary hearing is
13 going to be a wide-open free-for-all in which everybody
14 is going to be permitted to go out and get their own
15 experts and their own examination and their own cross

16 examination.
17

What we are suggesting is that the hearing has

18 to take into account in some form of sensitive fashion
19 the rights at issue, and if we come to a situation in

20 what I think are going to be those rare situations in
21 which we have a question of fact which has to be
22 resolved in order to make the decision whether closure
23 is appropriate, then it seems to me the trial judge in
24 careful and sensitive fashion can handle that in a
25 variety of ways, and one of those ways is to say to the

people who oppose closure, all right, tell me what you

2 want me to ask this victim about her abuse.

Tell me,

3

and I will determine whether or not I am going to ask it

4

to her.

5

Another way would be to have the victim

6

actually examined out of the public view, but with a

7

two-way communication system, so that people could hear

8

what was going on.

9

Justice Powell, in his concurring opinion in

10

Gannett, suggested that it is the responsibility of

11

those who oppose closure to come up with alternatives if

12

an impasse or a problem is reached, and I don’t back

13

away from that, but it seems to me both with some

14

sensitivity and some creativity and the technology that

15

exists we can come up with those kinds of alternatives

16

to some kind of a free-for-all situation, and really

17

that that ought not be the primary concern.

19

QUESTION:

In this hearing, this preliminary

hearing, would it be your view that the defense could

was after, defense counsel?

HR. McHUGH:

But I keep coming back to the

14 that it’s been interpreted doesn't in any meaningful

17 potentially embarrassing facts,

20 that is the bringing-forwardness that the statute has,

not prevent anybody from discussing or

24 otherwise disseminating what the victim

says while she

25 is on there, or he is on there.

QUESTION:

MR. McHUGH:

In fact, in this case, I believe

Would you say that it is a reasonable

MR. McHUGH*

9

QUESTION«

10

No,

I could not agree with that.

You would not agree with that?

MR. McHUGH:

Not in Massachusetts, Your Honor,

11 because we have addressed that problem in Massachusetts
12 through the so-called rape shield laws, of a type which
13 are burgeoning throughout the country, which are
14 designed to head off that kind of scenario from taking
15 place.

The victim’s prior sexual history and a whole

16 host of details concerning her conduct with others at
17 other times and even with the defendant himself at other

18 times is, unless — except in very narrow circumstances

20 thought a child, but I realize that is state by state.

MR. McHUGH:

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Hr. Sikora.

Very well.

8

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MITCHELL J. SIKORA, JR., ESQ.,

9

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. SIKORA:

10

11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, if I may, I would like to begin by

12 addressing several questions put by the Justices to my

13 brother.
14

Mr. Justice White asked about the availability

15 of a transcript in this case, and indeed, the record
16 shows that the Globe originally sought a transcript.
17 Page 12 of the Joint Appendix contains the motion of the
18 Globe that a transcript be made available in this case.
19 The Globe did not follow up that request in the course
20 of this proceeding.
21

Mr. Justice Blackmun asked whether there are

22 any empirical data which show the effectiveness of the

23 Massachusetts statute, and I agree with my brother that
24 there are not conclusive data.

On the other hand, by

25 way of background, as we observe in our brief, rape is

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the most underreported of all major crimes against the
2 person in the United States, and it is estimated
3 authoritatively that only two out of seven rapes are
4 reported in the country.
5

Given that background, and given certain

6 legislative history of this statute, we suggest that it
7 serves an eminently rational and compelling purpose.
8

QUESTION;

Well, suppose that is correct, that

9 two out of seven are unreported.

Does that mean that

10 the greater percentage of burglaries are not reported?
11

MR. SIKORAi

12 perhaps I misspoke.
13 are reported.
14

Mo, Your Honor.

If I may,

I meant that only two out of seven

That is, only one out of three and a half.

QUESTION;

Well, without using my figures,

15 does that mean the same thing is not true with respect
16 to other crimes, particularly in the inner city?
17

MR. SIKORA;

According to data released

18 annually by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, rape is
19 the most underreported of all crimes, because of several

20 of its inherent features, the profound embarrassment and
21 inhibition on the part of the victim, and above all, her
22 dread of her trial appearance.
23

QUESTION:

Well, isn’t the embarrassment just

24 as great in a closed courtroom as in an open one?
25 is bound to be cross examined.

She

There are, I assume, in

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 your courtrooms in Massachusetts a lot of unrelated to
2 her persons in that courtroom.

Isn't the reluctance

3 just that of testifying at all, rather than testifying
4 in an open court as distinguished from a closed
5 courtroom?
6

MR. SIKORA:

The suggestion of the empirical

7 literature of the last 15 years is that there is a
8 peculiar inhibition about testifying in front of a
9 crowd.

I would suggest also, Your Honor, that

10 testifying in a courtroom in which the jury, court
11 officers, the judge, and counsel are present nonetheless
12 puts all of them within the enclosure of the bar, and
13 under somewhat of a controlled setting, that is, a
14 setting controlled by the trial judge.

He can provide,

15 T think, a more protective atmosphere for the appearance
16 of the child.
17

QUESTION:

Of course, some of those, in our

18 cases, have talked a lot and have interfered with the
19 judicial process on occasion.

This morning we had a

20 case about — or alluded to, anyway, where bailiffs had
21 misbehaved.
22

MR. SIKORA:

That's correct, Your Honor.

If

23 one seeks perfection from the statute, some kind of

24 airtight anonymity for the child, and some type of
25 perfect laboratory condition for her testimony, we don't

10

In addition, two states permit the use of

Hr. Justice Brennan, you asked about the

16 peripheral offenses involved in the statute in

18 trials regarding illegitimacy and non-support.

19 believe that the Supreme Judicial Court has now excluded

20 those offenses.

QUESTION;

22

HR. SIKORA;

And I believe you will find at

that its holding is now limited only to the

rape and forced unnatural rape, and indeed, the entire

2 bulk of the court's reasoning rests for the most part on

3 a body of empirical literature and observations of the
4 past 15 years which center, again, on the crime of rape.
QUESTION;

5

The opinion and decision, I gather,

6 apply only to the crime of rape, but that doesn't mean

7 the other categories have been written out of the
8 statute, do they?

We would — we read the opinion

in Globe II to that effect. Your Honor.

15

MR. SIKORA;

— upon the crime of forcible

16 rape.
17

QUESTION;

Well, does that mean in effect that

18 as applied to these other offenses, your court has in
19 effect said the provision will be unconstitutional?
20

MR. SIKORA;

One cannot find that square

21 holding beyond the footnote, but the court does —

MR, SIKORA:

I believe the court has said in

3 Globe II that insofar — that trial judges will now be
4 guided by Globe II, and by Richmond Newspapers, and that
5 statement on Page 101 of the record in combination with
6 the essential reasoning which emphasizes the role of

7 rape and its peculiar physical and mental injury to the
8 victim leave the statute in effect only as to rape,

9 incest, or, I believe, carnal abuse.
10 crimes of sexual assault as to which

So it would be
the statute remains

constitutional and valid,

QUESTION:

Constitutional,

13

QUESTION:

May I ask a question about exactly

14 what is before us?

As I understand it, under the

16 improper order, because it closed the entire trial.
17

QUESTION:

That's correct.
And so they say it should be, in

19 effect, that more of the order should be set aside.

I

excluded the public from the testimony of two or three

As a consequence,

12

Essentially the purpose is to give her some protection

13

against the trauma of her testimony at trial.

14

through that kind of assurance by means of a mandatory

encourage the reporting and the prosecution of this

particular category of crime.

A number of the

criminal justice system itself ironically imposes a

24

second round of physical and psychological pain upon the

Indeed, a number of the writers recount the

2 ordeal of a victim, a young victim and her family as

3 they approach the trial process itself.

Typically, the

4 victim will have to visit the police station, the
5 district attorney's office, identification, go through
6 identification procedures,

and, of course, at the time

7 of trial itself confront the alleged rapist and undergo
8 cross examination.

9

Typically, too, the victim will experience a

number of trial continuances, and this will protract' her

inhibition, her embarrassment, and very often it will

cost the prosecution the value of her assistance.

In that regard. Your Honor, we

decision in which the Court held that a child, even with

1 the accompaniment of a parent or guardian, and even
2 though the child sincerely held the religious beliefs
3 involved, could not participate in street pamphleting or
4 prosyletizing in behalf of her religious views, and the
5 Court used rather strong language as to permissibility
6 of parents exposing their children to particular
7 activities which they felt strong enough to endure
8 themselves.

The majority said,

"Parents may be free to

9 become martyrs themselves," even a psychiatrist or a
10 college president, I would submit, "but it does not
11 follow that they are free in identical circumstances to
12 make martyrs of their children before they have reached
13 the age of full and legal disecretion" —

Do you consider testifying at trial

MR. SIKORA*

Testifying at a trial which is

I think is analogous.

8 identification — I am assuming that identification is
9 the issue on which guilt or innocence would hinge, and
10 apart, though, from the character of the crucial issue
11 in the case, a minor would still under this statute be
12 given sheltered testimony.
13

If I may, Justice Marshal, I would like to go

14 back to your question and wrestle with it a little more
15

QUESTION:

Yes.

16

MR. SIKORA:

It worries me, too.

I think there is a second

17 dimension to the reason why the state should not permit

18 even the willing minor or her family to expose her to
19 public testimony,

and that is the interest of the

20 government in the quality of her testimony.

The

21 government as an institution has a special interest in
22 the accuracy, the reliability of her testimony.
23

QUESTION:

Well, on the other hand, she could

24 go to the newspaper, get a TV camera, sit down in front

25 of them and testify, and there is nothing in the world

you could do to stop it
MR. SIKORAj

Absolutely, but at least that

3

communication would take place outside the very special

4

setting of a criminal trial to determine the guilt or

5 innocence of the accused.
6 the viewing of a jury.
7

It would take place out of

It is that precise circumstance

of testifying in front of a jury with the guilt or

8 innocence of a defendant at stake that makes her
9
10
11

testimony very precious stuff, and makes us want as much
as possible to assure its reliability and accuracy.
And incidentally, note that that concern about

12

the quality of her testimony leads as much to

13

exculpatory evidence as in this case, the victim was

14

acquitted — I'm sorry, the accused was acquitted — as

15

it does to inculpatory evidence that would lead to just

16

convictions.

17

conviction, which is the special concern of the state,

18

and the state, we say, may pre-empt the risk of even a

mature minor who has abundant confidence in her ability

It is a just result, acquittal or

20 to testify effectively, the state may pre-empt the risk
21

of her appearance in front of a full courtroom

22 containing members of the press in a situation in which
23

she might succumb to stress or otherwise compromise her

24

testimony, compromise the quality of that testimony.

25

There is perhaps one — and a third dimension

47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to the answer on waiver. Your Honor, and that is very
2 simply that even a waiver offer by the victim would
3 require probably some kind of hearing on the part of a
4 trial judge to assure himself that her waiver was
5 knowing, voluntary, and wise or intelligent.

In those

6 circumstances, again, the victim is drawn into another
7 preliminary hearing at which the issue is her capacity
8 to testify and perhaps her psychological strength or
9 stamina.
10
11

Again, there is a pulling and hauling over the
psyche of the child victim even before the trial

12 begins.

This in particular persuaded the Supreme

13 Judicial Court that preliminary hearings on waiver would
14 themselves begin to defeat the purpose of the statute.

MR. SIKORA*

9

QUESTION;

I believe so.
So you could have a 16-year-old

10

defendant and a 14-year-old victim, and these two

11

statutes would interact with one another.

12

MR. SIKORA;

23

point, and that is a mode of analysis which Mr. Justice

24

Brennan introduced in the Richmond Newspapers case, when

25

he suggested that we should test statutes of this kind

49
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 by inspection as to whether they interfere seriously
2 with the flow of information to citizens about their
3 courts or about their political institutions more
4 generally.
5

I believe that the Supreme Judicial Court has

6 tried very hard to shrink this statute to fit its
7 essential purpose.

Indeed, if we examine the remainder

8 of the trial open to the public, it is very
9 considerable.

All pre and post-trial proceedings remain

10 open, presumptively open.

Empanelment of the jury,

11 opening remarks, testimony of all other witnesses, and

12 typically there are five other categories of witnesses
13 -- police, medical and scientific evidence, prosecution
14 corroboration witnesses, defense evidence and defense
15 corroboration and alibi witnesses — in addition,
16 summation to the jury, jury instructions, rendition of
17 the verdict, all court papers, the appellate process,
18 all of these elements of the judicial process remain
19 open to the public.

20

My brother suggested that the statute might be

21 self-defeating because it left so much of the proceeding
22 open, but again, if one zeroes in on the very precise
23 purpose of the statute, simply to give the child an
24 enclave at the moment of testimony, I think one grasps

25 the true purpose of the statute, and appreciates the

50
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

effort of the Supreme Judicial Court to leave the

2 remainder of the trial and the judicial proceeding all
3

but entirely open.
Just to sum up then, we suggest that on other

4
5

occasions the press itself has recognized the social

6

value of some confidentiality, particularly in cases or

7

in legislation where it sought to shield the identity,

8 for example, of reporters* sources, and argued that such
9

confidentiality produced socially beneficial results.
Today, the government is arguing that some

10
11

reasonable confidentiality for children, victim to

12

crimes of sexual assault, serves equally important

13

purposes.

14

decision below respects both values, both the purposes,

15

the practical and humane purposes of the statute, and

16

the First Amendment.

We believe that the Supreme Judicial Court

17

We urge the Court to affirm that judgment.

MR. McHUGH;

1

But then I suggest to you that

2 there is —

3

QUESTION;

4 lawyer.

He has his parents.

Who else?

His

Who else?
MR. McHUGH;

5

Parents, lawyer, and friends, is

6 what the Supreme Judicial Court has said.

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. McHUGH;

9

QUESTION;

Friends.
You mean, all the friends he has?

MR. McHUGH;

10

11

Friends?

There has only been one case, and

there was only one friend in that case.

12 how far

I don’t know

the Court would take that principle, but that’s

13 what they’ve said, parents, family, and friends, and, of
14 course, lawyers.
QUESTION;

15

Now you are talking about the

16 j uvenile ?
17

MR. McHUGH;

No, I am back to the adult, in

18 this case, under 16(A), this statute, Mr. Chief Justice.
19

QUESTION;

Even an adult —

20

MR. McHUGH;

21

QUESTION;

Prosecuted under —
— defines offenses covered by this

22 statute?

23
24 cases.
25

MR. McHUGH;

That’s correct, in one of these

Indeed, that was a statute —
QUESTION;

So there's a minimum, in any event,

number of people, the jury, the judge, counsel, both

2 sides, the accused, and his father, mother, brothers,
3

sisters, and friends, whatever that means.

4

MR. McHUGH;

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. McHUGH;

7

QUESTION;

And friends.
And court officials.
And court officials.
Could the court under your theory

8 of the case impose an order on them that they could not
9

speak of the proceedings until after the verdict?
MR. McHUGH;

10

Well, but even — I don't believe

11

that we need to reach that question.

12

raises —

13
14
15

QUESTION;

I think it

Well, maybe we don't need to.

I am

just interested in your position.
MR. McHUGH;

Well, it raises extraordinarily

16

troublesome problems, I would suggest, because it is a

17

kind of prior restraint, and in order to exercise —

18

really what it boils down to again is the kind of

19

problem we are talking about with respect to imposing

20 that kind of a restraint on the press.
21

In order to

exercise his public trial guarantee in some form, those

22 members of the public whom the defendant has attend or
23

who do attend have to consent to the imposition of a

24

prior restraint.

25

QUESTION;

Could I ask you just one more — I

55

suppose if you prevailed in this you would certainly

2 request to get into the videotaped deposition type of
3

hearings.

4

MB. McHUGH;

5

QUESTION;

Not necessarily, because —
I know not necessarily, but what is

6 the probability?
7

MR. McHUGHs

8

QUESTION;

9
10

I —
Well, you needn't answer that if

you don’t want to.
MB. McHUGH;

No, I will be happy to tell you

11

why I think those are different, because what we are

12

asserting here is —

13

QUESTION;

Well, if they differ, would you

14

think it is probable you would try to get into those,

15

too, or not?

That's my question.

16

MR. McHUGH;

17

QUESTION;

18

MB. McHUGH;

19

Into the videotaped depositions?
Yes.
I would think that we would not

try to get into those, so long as the results of those

20 were going to be available when the case came on for
21

22

trial, and we could see what the jury could see.
QUESTION;

Well, then, why wouldn't you be

23

satisfied with a transcript of the entire trial after

24

the verdict comes in?

25

MR. McHUGH;

Because the transcript only

Well, not only that, it is not

MR. McHUGH:

6

QUESTION:

And it’s not instantaneous.
So that when you get that, it is

7 not news, it is history.
MR. McHUGH:

Well, it's not news, and it's

We don’t

We don’t see the kinds

Thank you, gentlemen.
