CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

We will hear arguments

Mr. Gruen, I think you may proceed whenever

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. GRUEN, ESQ.

7
8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. GRUEN;

Thank you very much.

Mr. Chief

9 Justice, members of the Court;
10

I'm here to argue for the preservation of one

11 of our subordinate constitutional rights, namely the
12 preservation of property.

That constitutional right

13 existed in its full sanctity —
14

QUESTION;

15

MR. GRUEN*

16

QUESTION;

Are you conceding that?
Excuse me, sir?
In that statement are you conceding

17 it*s a subordinate right?
18

(Laughter• )

19

QUESTION*

It's not so subordinate that you

20 can't prevail, is that it?
21

MR. GRUEN*

22

QUESTION*

I'm sorry?
Not so subordinate that you can't

23 prevail.
24

MR. GRUEN*

25

QUESTION*

I hope not, sir.
Argument by irony.

1

SR. GRUEN;

This constitutional right existed

2 in its full sanctity in Hew York prior to 1973.

At that

3

time Telepcompter and other cable television companies

4

made a practice of seeking owner consent before

5

installing cable television lines and the necessary

6

accompanying equipment.

7

It was their practice, dictated by management,

8 to solicit consent using a printed form which you’ll
9

find in the joint appendix at pages 32 to 33, which

10

provided specifically for compensation at the rate of

11

five percent of gross revenues derived from the building

12 on which the installation was made.
13

Effective as of January 1, 1973, Executive Law

14

Section 823 was adopted and made effective in New York,

15

prohibiting landlord interference with installations and

16

prohibiting any payments to landlords from cable

17

television companies or from tenants with respect to

18

such installations, with the exception of purely

19

discretionary compensation which could be made by the

20 cable television commission with respect to
21

installations servicing the tenants on the property on

22 which the installation was made, and then only if
23

application was made for it within a very short period

24

after the installation had been made, some, I believe,

25

180 days if I remember correctly.

This

2

QUESTION*

Tha crossovers aren't evan subject

3 to that/ are they?
4

HR. GRUEN*

That’s right.

According to the

5 Court of Appeals, there may be no compensation for
6 crossovers under any circumstances.
7

Hrs. Loretto then brought this action sounding

8 in trespass, and the sole defense remaining after the
9 elimination of a number of defenses by the Court of
10 Appeals is Section 828, and we're presented therefore
11 with tha guestion of whether there are any extraordinary
12 factors which take this case out of the usual rule that
13 a landlord is entitled to exclusive possession, and
14 particularly to exclusivity with respect to the
15 installation of permanent installations on the property,
16 particularly including television aerials and the like.
17

He have urged throughout this case the

18 observance of a par sa or absolute rule —
19

QUESTION*

20

MR. GRUEN*

21

QUESTION*

Excuse me, Hr. Gruen.
Yes, Justice Brennan.
There's no distinction made between

22 commercial and residential property?
23

MR. GRUEN*

No distinction was made between

24 commercial and residential property, that’s correct.
25 The Court of Appeals referred to rental properties in

general.

I suppose at some point there may be some fine

2 tuning on that, but that's how it stands.
3

QUESTION:

But there was no commercial

4

property issue presented by the record in this case, was

5

there?
MR. GRUEN:

6
7

Your Honor, the designated class

is the owners of property in Hew York State on which

8 Teleprompter has made installations.

QUESTION:

9

MR. GRUEN:

10

Hell, is that class perfected?
Not by the giving of notice, but

11

it has been certified by the Supreme Court, that is to

12

say the trial level court in New York, as consisting of

13

all owners of property in the state on which

14

installations have been made, with a minor exception

15

which I don't think we need to go into here.

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. GRUEN:

18

QUESTION:

19

Hell, who are they?
Who are all of these?
Who are they?

I think the question

is, are there any owners of commercial — non-rental

20 commercial property included in that class?
21

22

Do you

know?
MR. GRUEN:

I do not know as to non-rental,

%

23

although I can say that the city license obliges

24

Teleprompter to service hospitals, which would normally

25

be non-rental commercial facilities.

1

QUESTIO»:

How about just a warehouse or

2 something like that?
3
4 the class.

HR. GRUEN:

Clearly it would be included in

I can't point you to instances.

I do know

5 that there is at least one case which was decided in New
6 York City which deals with a commercial rental property
7 on which Hanhattan Cable Television had made the
8 installation, not Teleprompter.
9

QUESTIONS

Well, if you're going to make that

10 argument, then it applies to private residences.
11 Literally, they're among the class, just as well as
12 commercial property.
13

HR. GRUEN:

You've brought me to the exception

14 which I was not going to go into, yes.
15

QUESTIONS

16

SR. GRUENs

All right.
There is an exception for single

17 family residences on which the installation serves the
18 sole function of servicing that residence, the theory
19 being obviously

that the owner of that residence has in

20 effect implicitly invited Teleprompter onto the property
21 to render the service.
22

But if the line continues from that television

23 set on to the next property, it's a crossover and then
24 that owner is within the class.
25

QUESTION:

Suppose an owner who doesn't — an

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

owner of a single family residence who doesn't want the

2 service nevertheless has to put up with the wires in

3 order for Teleprompter to get to the next property?

Is

4 that what you're suggesting?
5

1R. GRUENs

If the premise is a non-rental

6 premise, which I recognize can change from time to time,

7 but if at the instance you're talking about it's
8 non-rental, then the Court of Appeals has interpreted
9

Section 828 as not covering that.

So that the owner

10

would be entitled to preclude entry by the television

11

com pany.
QUESTION!

12

Whether he wants the service or

13 not ?
14

SR. GRUENs

Well, of course, if he wants it

15 he's welcome to have it in and he can allow entry to the
16 extent he wishes, precluding, if he wants, a crossover.
17

We have urged here the observance of a per se

18 or absolute rule in an era when we recognize that
19 balancing of constitutional rights is popular, on the
20 theory that it is traditional in the area of physical
21

occupation of property or seizure of title to observe a

22 per se rule, although this Court has seldom had an

23 opportunity in perhaps the last century or so to apply
24 that principle.

There are some exceptions which I'll

25 mention in a moment.

1

Kaiser Aetna for one states that the right to

2 exclude is universally held to be a fundamental element
3

of the property right, which the government cannot take

4

without compensation.

5

physically invades only an easement in property, it must

And even if the government

6 nonetheless pay just compensation.
7

In St. Louis versus Western Onion, which is an

8 1893 case, this Court held that the installation of
9

telegraph lines and poles in a municipality, no matter

10

how de minimis that installation might be, constitutes a

11

taking, and that the city’s use of the top crossarm of

12

the pole constitutes a taking by the city.

13

There’s similar dictum of this Court in United

14

States versus Causby, 1948, and one might also look to

15

the Delaware Railroad case, 1928, where the Court held

16

that a municipality’s direction to a railroad company to

17

set aside a portion of the private street running

18

through the railroad station property as a taxi stand

19

constitutes a taking.

20
21

In none of these, I submit, was there any
balancing approach with respect to the determination of

22 whether a property right had been taken.
23

The balancing approach does come in in

24

regulation cases, such as Prunelard versus Robins, where

25

the Court, on the basis of the ruling made in

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVF

SW

WASHINGTON D C. 90024

554-2345

1

California, recognized that tha people who had come onto

2 the property to distribute literature and solicit
3

signaturas ware part of tha ganeral public who were

4

invited onto the property, were properly there, and were

5

present by virtue of a special invitation made by the

6 owner to tne general public to coma onto the proparty.
7

And the question was, to what extent can the state

8 regulate tha activities of such people or the activities
9
10
11

of the owner with respect to such people on the
property.
The regulation concept grew up entirely

12 distinctly from the old-fashioned physical occupation or
13
14

seizure of title concept.
QUESTIONS

Mr. Gruen, can this ordinance or

15

statute be regarded as a form of regulation, to the

16

extent that it affects the tenants, as opposed to the

17

crossover, a landlord-tenant regulation?

18

many such regulations extant around the country

19

requiring landlords to furnish utilities or other such

And there are

20 requirements.
21

SR. GRUEN:

Yes, Your Honor, there certainly

22 are and there are in New York as well.

However, we’ve

23

been unable to find any instance in which any such

24

regulation, first of all, obliges the landlord to accept

25

the installation of somebody else’s property on his

10

1 property.
2

QUESTION;

3

HR. GRUEN:

Permanently.
Permanently — or for that matter

4 I can’t think of any unpermanent one.
5

QUESTION*

6

MR. GRUEN*

7

QUESTION*

How about telephone equipment?
Telephone equipment is a
It continues to belong to the

8 telephone company.
9

MR. GRUENs

That’s true. Your Honor.

And to

10 my knowledge there are no cases which oblige a landlord
11 to permit the telephone company to enter property and
12 make installations without compensation to the
13 landlord.

It is certainly very common that this

14 happens, we recognize that, and we think it’s because
'15 landlords recognize that telephone service is desirable
16 tenants want it.
17

QUESTION*

You found no statutory requirement

18 that landlords allow tenants to be served by telephone
19 service?
20

MR. GRUEN*

That’s right, Your Honor.

As a

21 matter of fact, in New York it’s very clear that
22 telephone companies are obliged by statute to provide
23 compensation.

And furthermore, there is written into

24 the law a protection for the practical situation where
25 the landlord does permit the telephone company to come

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
dnn VIRGINIA A VP

SW

WAR Ml MG TOM D G OnnOA nn 91 XfsA-OZAR

1 in, as in through an informal license, without requiring
2 compensation.

That statute says that no prescriptive

3 easement or right can arise as a result of this informal
4 permission.
5

So you have a very iifferant situation from

6 Section 828, which obliges the landlord to accept the
7 presence of this stranger's property, and indeed creates
8 a very strong possibility that 20 years later the
9 telephone company — the cable company will have earned
10 a prescriptive easement.
11

QUESTION;

Bell, you mean you think that

12 Section 823 would be defensible if it contained an
13 additional provision that said no prescriptive right
14 will attach?
15

SR. GHUENs

No, Your Honor.

I think that a

16 situation would be defensible -- that such a provision
17 might be desirable, but it would only protect as to a
18 voluntary acceptance by the landlord of the presence of
19 the cable facilities on his property.

I think that what

20 creates the problem here is that the government insists
21 that the landlord allow the cable company to make its
22 installation .
23

QUESTIONS

Well, would you think it would be

24 different if the law said — if the law saids

in one

25 paragraph, all apartment buildings will be equipped with

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 sprinkler systems for fire prevention; section two, all
2 apartment buildings shall be equipped with cables or
3 equipment so that television — or so that tenants may
4 easily plug into cable television.

A regulation that

5 required the landlord to make these installations, like
6 he does sprinklers or hot water heaters or something
7 else?
8

HR. GRUEN:

I think that solves half the

9 problem, Your Honor.
10

QUESTION:

Half the problem?

Does it solve it

11 all or not?
12

HR. GRUEN:

No, it would not solve it all,

13 because the second part of —
14

QUESTION:

Hell, it wouldn't be a taking

15 problem then, would it?
16

HR. GRUEN;

I believe it would. Your Honor,

17 insofar as it requires a substantial expenditure without
18 compensation.

We don't have this case, but I think that

19 what —
20

QUESTION*

21 sprinkler system?
22

Well, what about, say, installing a
Very expensive.

HR. GRUEN*

Well, that's true, and at least in

23 New York a landlord is entitled to compensation in the
24 form of rent, increased rent, for making such
25 improvements on his property.

I think this is the

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
Ann VIRGINIA AVF

SW

WA.QWINSTON n P 0(\f\0A (OnO\ RRA-1XAR

1 second factor which distinguishes our case from the
2 safety and health measure cases, such as sprinkler
3 systems and the like.
4

QUESTION*

Would you say that that comes under

5 the police power as a matter of public safety, because
6 it involves not only the safety of one tenant, but -7

HR. GRUENs

Yes, I think it does. Your Honor.

8 I think where the problem is presented in New York with
9 respect to such rules is because of the existence of the
10 pervasive system of rent control.
11

QUESTION:

But you would say that the benefits

12 of television are not as great as the benefit of being
13 free from a fire, is that it?
14

HR. GRUENs

15

QUESTION*

I would certainly say that, yes.
Well, would it solve your problem

16 if the law said in section two, it said, you will
17 install these Teleprompter or these cable television
18 cables whenever some cable television company will pay
19 you for it?

That wouldn't cost you anything.

Any time

20 they offer to pay for the installation, you'll put them
21 all over.
22

HR. GRUENs

I think, of course, such a payment

23 would have to be made in advance, and I assume that's
24 part of your question.
25

QUESTIONS

Yes.

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR . GRUEN

It doesn't solva the entire

2 problem, interestingly enough.

It changes the precise

3 location of the easement from the surface of the roof to
4 inside the wire.

Here you're positing that the wire

5 itself is owned by the landlord, but the cable company
6 has the right to pass its signal through the wire
7 without compensation to the landlord, for its commercial
8 benefit.
9

QUESTION*

No, the tenant.

The tenant has the

10 right to pass it through from where it's connected on
11 the outside of the building.
12

HR. GRUEN:

You're asking, supposing the

13 tenant could make an installation from the outside of
14 the building to his particular apartment?
15

QUESTION;

No.

The landlord has from the edge

16 of his building to all the tenants' apartments, he has
17 installed a cable, for which he's been paid.

And the

18 cable company comes along and just plugs in at the edge
19 of his property.

20

NR. GRUEN*

I think if obliged by the

21 government, that that would have to be compensated in
22 some form.
23

And I think that this —
QUESTION:

Hell, they've paid him for the

24 expense.

25

MR. GRUEN:

I'm sorry?

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION*

The cable company pays him the

2 exp ense.
3

HR. GRUEN*

4

QUESTION:

5

He's not out of pocket.

HR. GRUEN:

I think I would not have a problem

with your example in a state other than New York, which

8 doesn't have rent control.
9

But you

say there’s still an appropriation of his property?

6
7

Yes.

There I would assume that

the landlord can set whatever rents he wishes and

10

thereby compensate himself for the expenditures he makes

11

in improving the property.
New York presents the problem that there is no

12
13

way of a landlord compensating himself for such an

14

expenditure other than by a permitted increase in rent,

15

and in fact I think that’s why New York allows for

16

increases in rent for virtually all of the examples

17

which this Oourt has proposed in the oral discussion

18

now.

19

QUESTION*

Did you suggest, Mr. Gruen, that --

20 are there New York statutes which require landlords, say
21

in apartment buildings, to install sprinkler systems,

22 smoke detectors and that sort of thing?
23

HR. GRUEHs

24

QUESTION;

25

compensation?

Yes, there are.
And what do they say as to

I didn’t catch that?

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

SR. GRUENs

There was one very recently

2 adopted with respect to smoke detectors.

It requires

3 that the tenant pay the landlord for a particular price
4 which is the presumptive price of the smoke detector.
5

QUESTIONS

I see.

So actually the cost is

6 paid by the tenant, not by the landlord?
7

HR. GRUENs

That's right.

And furthermore,

8 that the tenant maintains the smoke detector.
9

QUESTIONS

Well, it's not paid by the landlord

10 here, either.

The cost of installation isn't paid by

11 the landlord.

It's going to be paid by the cable

12 company.
13

HR. GRUENs

14

QUESTION*

Yes.
So he doesn't have to charge the

15 tenant for the cost.
16

HR. GRUENs

17

QUESTION*

That's right.
But he's not paid by the tenant for

18 the fact that the sprinklers occupy a piece of his
19 property.
20

QUESTIONS

Well, the sprinklers

becomes his

21 property, I suppose, become the landlord's property.
22

HR. GRUENs

Yes, of course, and he's

23 indemnified by whatever ha wishes to charge in rent for
24 the cost of the sprinklers.
25

There's a slight difference between a smoke

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 alarm and the cable installation, because the smoke
2 alarm is within the tenant’s own apartment, it occupies
3 no additional space not let by the original demise.
4

QUESTION:

fir. Sruen, aren't you — you're

5 arguing mainly a question of compensation.

I thought

6 your basic position in the brief was that there's a
7 basic distinction between a physical invasion by a third
8 pacty and a regulation which requires the owner of the
9 property to do something to his own property, and then
10 you have a question of whether that amounts to a
11 taking.
12

And aren’t all these examples that have been

13 given to you simply forms of regulation?

They don’t

14 even approach the basic argument that you've made, isn't
15 that right?
16

HR. GRUEN:

Yes, they are.

I think they grow

17 out of a hypothetical —
18

QUESTION;

They are reasonable regulations of

19 an owner's use of his property.
20

£R. GRQEN;

Yes, yes, and particularly because

21 they involve some measure of compensation, I think that
22 they —
23

QUESTION;

But it's arguable they might not

24 even require compensation if you look at them as — if
25 you view them as regulatory rather than as takings,

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1 rather than as physical invasions.
2

SR. GRUEN*

They certainly involve a different

3 level —
4

QUESTION*

None of them involves a physical

5 invasion, which I understand to be your principal
6 argument.
7

SR. GRUEN*

That’s absolutely correct.

8

QUESTION*

What about the phone company’s

9 invasion in New York apartments, where they run the wire
10 right straight up the wall?
11

SR. GR'JEN*

Well, as a landlord I have a

12 perfect right to tall the phone company that I don’t
13 want them on my property.
14

QUESTION*

But you don’t do it.

15

SR. GRUEN;

I may choose not to,

and in fact

You don’t do it, and the tenant has

The

SR. GRUEN*

Yes, yes.

But it’s the landlord’s

24 voluntary choice not to charge the cable company — the
25 telephone company.

He has a perfect right to charge the

HR. GRUEN:

Actually, it doesn't.

If one

thinks this through in the New York context, it's quite

25

clear that it can't.

There is a virtually nonexistent

2 cable is unlikely to all additional tenancy to the
3 building.

And Section 828 absolutely prohibits the

4 landlord from asking increased rent because of the
5 presence of the cable.

Therefore, you have no income to capitalize

7 into a higher value.

As to those

23 which were in effect and had three or four years to run

25 payment being made to the landlord or is that money now

1 paid to the city pursuant to the ordinance?
2

NR. GRUENs

Well, the payments to the city are

3 a completely separate item.

The payments to the

4 landlords, according to one statement in the record of
5 Teleprompter in an appendix to an agreement with Hughes
6 Aircraft, said that the payments to the landlords
7 continued to be made until mil-1974 under contracts, and
8 at that point, apparently whether the contract had time
9 to run or not, Teleprompter simply cease! making the
10 payments.
11

QUESTION»

As1 I read the ordinance, it would

12 prohibit the continued payment pursuant to those
13 agreements.
14

NR. GRUENs

Yes, I agree with you.

15

You understand that the payments to the city

16 are entirely distinct.

They're made under the franchise

17 agreement, so-called, with the city and they consist of
18 five percent of gross revenues.
19

QUESTION*

But aren't they the same five

20 percent of gross revenues?
21

MR. GRUEHs

22 It adds up to tan.

I mean, say —

They're a different five percent.
That five percent to the city is

23 paid for a precisely analogous use to that which is made
24 of the rooftops on our blocks.

It's for the use of the

25 city streets for the passage of cable underneath.

1

And I should make clear that the right of

2 landlords to be free of such installations in New York
3 or to be compensated for them if they chose to be was
4 extremely clear under case law in New York up until
5 1973.

There are innumerable cases which say that any

6 installation made by a tenant outside of his own
7 apartment can be prohibited by the landlord, and if the
8 landlord chooses to allow it to persist the landlord is
9 entitled to compensation for it.
10

In particular, there are a number of cases

11 dealing with television antenna installations on
12 rooftops, where the courts say that the landlord may
13 prohibit it or receive compensation, and rent control
14 regulations up until 1973 provided for compensation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERWIN GRISWOLD, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLEE
MR. GRISWOLD*

25 question of New York law.

That, Mr. Chief Justice, is a
On it I would rely on the

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1 opinion filed in this case by the Attorney General of
2 New York# in which he says that if a tenant wants
3 telephone service that he can apply to the Public
4 Service Commission of New York, which would direct the
5 telephone company to condemn an easement to provide the
6 television service to that building.
7

I think that as I understand the law of New

8 York, the landlord could not prevent the installation of
9 telephone service.

But under the statutory law of New

10 York, which goes back 90 years, that right to enter the
11 premises would be obtained by condemning an easement.

Which is not the case here.
I like to suggest that this

17 really a kind of an academic question, quite apart from
18 that lovely apartment building that the Chief Justice
19 would like to live in.

But I think the fact that there

20 simply aren't any cases on this arises from the fact
21 that no landlord would dream of telling a tenant that
22 you can't have a telephone in your place.

It's simply

23 taken for granted.
24

I think it's important to look at the terms of

25 this statute, which appears in the appendix to our red

4
5

How, I won't read the rest, though it is
relevant.

There are other provisions of the statute

6 which set up a cable television commission which has
7

authority to make awards.

It has made a general

8 regulation to the effect that there is no damage, that
9

there is no loss to a landlord in the ordinary case, and

10

that the ordinary landlord is entitled to simply a

11

nominal payment, which is one time, one dollar.

It suggests an answer, made by

And that I think gets to the heart of the

22 case, because here the Appellant's case depends upon the
23
24
25

assertion that Srs. Loretto's property has been taken.
But that begs the question.

The issue here is

what is the extent of the landlord's property after a

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W . WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

lease has been made.

This is property which, when Mrs.

2 Loretto owns it alone and keeps it vacant, is

3 undoubtedly hers, and Section 828 has no application to
4 it.
5
6

But when she chooses to devote the property to
rental purposes, that connotes a divided ownership of

7 the property.
8 property,

She no longer is the sole owner of that

and the tenant has rights not only with

9 respect to, shall I say, the six walls of the apartment,
10 but also has a

11

great many other rights with respect to

the usage of that building.

12

QUESTION:

Then if you treat this as a right,

13 then does the statute not taka something away from the
14 tenants without compensation?
15

MR. GRISWOLDs

16

QUESTION:

No, it gives it to the tenant.

It depends on whether you regard

17 this as a boon or otherwise, I suppose.
18

MR. GRISWOLDs

It does not in any way

19 interfere with the tenant's use of any rights which he
20 may have in the overall premises.

It does facilitate

21 his use, if ha chooses, to have cable television.

22

But let’s suppose, for example, that a

23 landlord makes a lease and when the tenant arrives with
24 the moving van the landlord stands at the door and
25 says:

Stop, there's nothing in the lease about bringing

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 ia furnituce.

Or suppose the landlord says, there's

2 nothing in the lease about bringing in food; that will
3 attract mice and that will lead to vermin, and I must
4 insist as a health measure that you not bring in food.
5

Of course the landlord would not be sustained

6 even though there was no provision in the lease about
7 this.

That was a term of

SR. GRISWOLD*

And Sew York has changed the

19 law with respect to the respective rights of landlord
20 and tenant, and our position would be that that is a
21 standard part of the powers of a state legislature, to
22 regulate the rights of landlord and tenant.
23

QUESTION:

But that doesn't cover the

24 crossovers, does it?
25

MR. GRISWOLD;

In this case the landlord is

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

subjected to no costs.

The costs are entirely paid by

2 the television company or by the tenant.
3

QUESTION;

But in effect this landlord is

4

required not only to provide for the tenants of her

5

property, but to provide for the tenants of some other

6

landlord by giving a crossover.

7

Well, that gets to — that gets

9

QUESTION;

Nell, we ought to be careful,

10 taking about New York City apartment leases.

Because o

11 the 30 or 40 provisions in the lease, the tenant only
12 has one protection, one provision to protect the
13 tenant.
14

That gives him the right to pay.
And all the others — for example, one

15 provision is if the landlord decides that the tenant is
16 not a decent person he can throw him out.

And another

17 provision, I hereby give up my right to a jury trial.
18

I don’t think those are common all over, but

19 they are legal in New York and are approved by the New
20 York courts.
21

MR. GRISWOLD;

Well, I think in due course I

22 will come to a few rights that the tenant does have.

I

23 would like to point out that this particular statute is
24 supportable in our view not merely by the power of New
25 York to regulate the respective interests of landlord

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

3 findings of the statute, interest of the State of Hew
4 York in fostering and developing improved communications
5 and educational facilities.

7 argument?

QUESTION;

May I interrupt you on that

Supposing the statute changed the words

8 "cable television" to the word "telephone."

Everywhere

9 it says "cable" it said "telephone," and otherwise it
10 were precisely the same, there's an interest in
11 communication by telephone.
12

Would that be lawful, constitutional?

13

ME. GRISWOLD*

I think it would be, Mr.

14 Justice, and I would suggest that for all practical
15 purposes that is the law of New York today.
16

QUESTION*

I thought earlier we had agreed

17 that if there were to be a television installation it
18 would be a taking for which there'! have to be
19 condemnation and a payment?
20

MR. GRISWOLD*

Under the statutory law of New

21 York, which went back to very early days and much more
22 conventional notions of taking than have been developed
23 in this Court, let's say in the last ten years —

I wouldn’t doubt myself that if New York were

7 now to repeal that telephone statute, which requires —
8 is interpreted to require the taking and paying, and to
9 substitute a statute like 828, I’d rather like to argue
10 that case here.

I kind of think maybe it could be won.

11 At least that’s the —
12

QUESTION*

It’d really be quite a departure

13 from what the telephone companies in 50 states have been
14 doing for a long, long time, wouldn’t it?
15

SR. GRISWOLD*

I don’t think so, Mr. Justice.

16 I think you will find — you will find that it is very
17 hard to find that any telephone company has paid for
18 that right for a long, long time.
19

QUESTION*

When you say paid for that right,

20 Mr. Griswold, do you mean the right to have an easement
21 to string poles?
22

MR. GRISWOLD*

No, I don’t mean it.

I mean

23 the right to bring in a feeder line to lead telephone
24 service into a residence or into a business building.
25

QUESTION:

Well, what if New York amended 828

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1 to provide that, because of our interest in
2 communications, in the event that there isn't any
3 telephone -- system of telephone poles in this
4 particular area — let’s assume the poles are above
5 ground — that any landlord shall allow the telephone
6 company to put a pole in his back yard, without having
7 to pay for it?
8

SR. GRISWOLD:

I think that there is a

9 distinction between what I call trunk lines and feeder
10 lines, and there are old cases of this Court, 100 years
11 ago, involving telephone — telegraph companies putting
12 their lines down city streets and down railroad rights
13 of way, and it was held that they had to pay for that
14 right.

And I would suspect that if New York passed a

15 statute saying that any cable television company is
16 entitled to put its trunk lines on private property
17 without paying, that that would not be held to be
18 constitutional.
19

I think it is different with respect to feeder

20 lines, and that perhaps is an appropriate place for me
21 to come to the crossover problem.
22 of crossovers, as I see it.

There are two kinds

The New York Court of

23 Appeals said there were three, but I'think that two of
24 those present the same legal issue.
25

One is what I call the short crossover, and

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W.. WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that is that when the cable comes in on the roof to this
2 building, having come from the adjacent building on this
3 side and serving a tenant in this building,

then the

4 cable continues, and the record shows in this case four
5 to six feet, in order to bring service to the next
6 building.
7

And we suggest, first, that that’s de minimis;

8 and second, that there is a clear quid pro quo in it,
9 because this building's tenants get the service because
10 there’s a crossover from the next building, and to say
11 that in order to do that you have to provide the same
12 kind of a lead to the adjoining building on the other
13 side doesn’t seem very serious.
14

But in any event, we would contend that that

15 is not a taking requiring a payment under the Fifth
16 Amendment as applied to the states by the Fourteenth.
17

Sow, the other one is what I call the pure

18 crossover, and that is the situation where there is no
19 tenant in this building who has cable television, but
20 the cable television company wants to bring the cable
21 from the building on the right across this building in
22 order to get to the building on the left.
23

And I would say that even that, even as

24 applied to that, the statute is valid, just as the New
25 fork statute now provides that a person who builds a new

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

apartment house must provide it with water and sewer

2 service.

There are no tenants in the building when he

3

is building it.

4

after he has completed it if his rents are so high that

5

he can't get people in.
Nevertheless, he won't get a building permit

6
7

There may be no tenants for six months

to start with unless he provides water and sewer

8 service.
9

QUESTION*

You necessarily say that if you

10

aided to the water and sewer telephone lines, that they

11

must provide telephone lines too if this statute

12

includes it?

13

MR. GRISWOLD:

I think, Mr. Justice, Mr. Chief

14

Justice, that if New York should change its statute and

15

say that a person building a new multiple dwelling

16

apartment house must provide telephone lines in the

17

building when it's built, that such a statute would be

18

clearly constitutional.

19

QUESTION*

And laundromats and a room for

20 vending machines?
21

MR. GRISWOLD*

Laundromats and room for

22 vending machines become more difficult, but -23

I don't know why.

I don’t know

24

why, under the rationale of the court below, a

2

MR. GRISWOLDs

Well, perhaps this is the time

3 for me to come to another part of my argument.

The

4 contention is made by Hrs. Loretto’s counsel that
5 several of the cases that I would bring before you,
6 including a whole series of labor cases which have
7 completely denied the right of the owner of property to
8 exclude people — the owner of property under this
9 Court’s decision has to admit union representatives
10 under certain circumstances —
11

QUESTION:

Were those cases statute or

12 constitutional arguments?
13

MR. GRI3W0LD;

Those are affirming orders of

14 the National Labor Relations Board.

They have the

15 general statute —
16

QUESTION;

That’s Babcock.

17

MR. GRISWOLD;

18

-- of fair dealing behind it, but no specific

Babcock, that’s right.

19 —
20

QUESTION;

But rejecting constitutional

21 objections.
22

MR. GRISWOLD;

They do reject the

23 constitutional objection, and do it — and do it on a
24 —
25

QUESTION;

Prunelard basis.

1

SR. GRISWOLD;

Well, PruneYard is another one

2 of them.

But the Republic Aviation case, one of the

3 early ones, quotes Judge Augustus Hand, who was dealing
4 with a ship and union organizers wanted to go on board
5 the ship, which was really the only place that they
6 could get to the employees, because otherwise the ship's
7 on the high seas.

And Justice Augustus Hand sail, it is

8 not every interference with property rights which is
9 within the Fifth Amendment.
10
11 cases.

And this Court has followed that in the labor
We think that the PruneYard case is another

12 clear example of that.

California said, through its

13 Supreme Court, applying its constitution, that the owner
14 of a shopping center was required to allow the admission
15 of people for the purpose of soliciting signatures and
16 distributing literature.

And this Court held that that

17 was not a taking requiring compensation under the Fifth
18 Amendment.
19

But —
QUESTION;

Is there a qualitative difference,

20 however, between a temporary use of property and a
21 permanent occupation of a portion of the space?
22

NR. GRISWOLD;

Well, Justice O'Connor, that's

23 just the point I am coming to.
24 this is a permanent occupation.

Our friends say that
I would suggest in the

25 first place that it is not a permanent occupation.

It's

38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 an occupation only as long as the landlord chooses to
2 use this for rental purposes.
3

The landlord can occupy the building himself

4 and Section 828 no longer has any application.

In other

5 words, it is what we call a use-dependent regulation.
6

QUESTION*

I suppose that's a little like the

7 argument that the employer in the labor cases could go
8 out of business if ha wanted to.
9

HR. GRISWOLD;

10

QUESTION;

That the employer —

In the labor cases, could just go

11 out of business, and then he wouldn't be subjected to
12 this invasion of his property any more.
13

HR. GRISWOLD;

14

QUESTION;

15 here.

No, no.

And that's what you're saying

The landlords could always go out of the rental

16 business.
17

HR. GRISWOLD;

Go out of the rental business,

18 yes, but not necessarily go out of business.
19

I have put together a list of 17 instances

20 where there are permanent occupations of a landlord's
21 premises.

Sprinklers has already been referred to, and

22 this Court in the Queenside Hills Realty Company case
23 upheld the validity of that statutory provisions.
24

QUESTION;

I don't know that sprinklers is

25 right on point, though, because the landlord owns the

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sprinkler

2

HR. GRISWOLD*

3 our opponents.

That suggestion is also made by

Would this statute be better if it said

4 that the landlord must put in cable television and he
5 owns it and he pays for it?

It seems to me that here

6 the landlord is better off, less burdened by a statute
7 which says —
8

QUESTION*

But the sprinkler is a matter of

9 public safety, not only for the landlord but for all his
10 tenants.
11

HR. GRISWOLD*

12

QUESTIOB*

Well, that’s also —

Where is the safety factor, the

13 police power factor, in television?
14

HR. GRISWOLD*

The facilitation of

15 communication and education seems to me to come within
16 the police power.
17

QUESTION*

Of course, then the landlord can

18 buy any sprinkler system he wants to, too.

But here

19 you’re telling him what one he's going to get.

He

20 doesn’t have a choice of cable TV operators, does it?
21

HR. GRISWOLD*

I think that that’s only

22 because the city has franchised one company.

That's not

23 the result of the tenant.
24
25 ordinance.

QUESTION*

Well, yes, but you're attacking an

You're attacking a law.

The city wants to

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 protect its five percent, so it says, please, landlord,
2 you're not going to get a choice of cable operator.
3

HR. GRISWOLD;

Well, I suppose they'd get

4 their five percent from whatever cable operators they
5 franchise.
6

I don't think that makes any difference.
2DESTI3!!:

Well then, the city doesn't need to

7 franchise some of them, because they don't ask for it,
8 as this amicus brief makes clear.
9

HR. GRISWOLD;

Well, in addition to fire

10 escapes and sprinklers — in addition to sprinklers,
11 there are fire escapes and smoke detectors, and those
12 have a safety element in it.
13

But let me point out several things.

14 Causby case has been referred to.

The

We usually think of

15 that as the case which said that when there are
16 low-flying planes that means that is a taking.

But the

17 Causby case is the case which, by way of dictum, but it
18 certainly is one of the most powerful dictums that was
19 ever uttered by this Court, said that the statutes of
20 Congress which provide that the upper air space is a
21 public highway and can be used freely without
22 compensation, thereby changing the clear common law,
23 which said from the surface of the earth to the highest
24 heavens, the Court in the Causby case said that property
25 can be taken without compensation.

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Sow, similarly in Block and Hirsch, which is

2 the early rent control case.

The statute in that case

3 provides the tenant can continue to occupy the property
4 after the end of the lease if he continues to pay the
5 same rent, and that is surely a permanent occupation.
And one that rather appeals to me is

6

7 mailboxes.

We have cited Section 57 of the New York

8 Multiple Dwelling Act.

Mr. Gruen in his brief says,

9 well, there isn't any requirement that there be
10 mailboxes.

11

Office Department, through regulations — and this is --

12 this is

13

What the situation is is that the Post

"Domestic Mail Manual," Section 155.6, says that:
"Delivery of mail shall be contingent upon the

14 installation and maintenance of mail receptacles
15 approved by the Postal Service."
16

Which would mean that if you don't have the

17 receptacles you don't get mail.

But New York has

18 provided by Section 57 that you must provide for
19 receptacles.
20

And let's continue with the Post Office

21 regulations.

There is a regulation on apartment house

22 mail receptacles called Publication

17, and it provides

23 on page 12 that mailboxes must be 6 inches by 5 inches
24 by 15 inches.

Now, if you multiply that out, it's 450

25 cubic inches.

And if you taka a half-inch cable which

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 is on the roof, it takes 194 feet of half-inch cable to
2 occupy 450 cubic inches.
3

QUESTION*

4 like the sprinklers.
5

Well, again you're — there it’s
They're the landlord’s boxes.

HR. GRISWOLD;

He has to pay for them, yes.

6 And Mrs. Loretto is better off.

She doesn't have to pay

7 for the —
8

QUESTION;

I know.

But nevertheless, they’re

9 a third party coining in and taking a piece of your
10 property or occupying a piece of your property.
11

MR. GRISWOLD;

This is permanent occupation of

12 a part of Mrs. Loretto’s property, which she is not free
13 to use for some other purpose.
14

QUESTION;

What if New York added Telex to the

15 CATV as a leans of communication?
16

MR. GRISWOLD;

Well, the time might come when

17 that would seem to be reasonable.
18 rather far-fetchei.

As of now it seems

But in New York City I suggest that

19 cable television has become as near a necessity as a

20 telephone mi electric service, as to which there really
21 isn’t any question because they are always provided.
22

And what New York was trying to do through

23 this statute was to

facilitate the development of cable

24 service as a means of improving communication and
25 education in the city of New York or the state of New

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 York.

Ani I would suggest that that is within the

2 generally accepted powers of state legislatures.
3

How, I would like to refer to Penn Central.

4 It's easy to say, well, Penn Central is just
5 regulation.

It’s not — it doesn't have anything to do

6 with occupation.

But the fact was that all that space

7 up there, which was reachable by the Penn Central people
8 by building up it, was taken away from them.

It isn’t

9 that it is occupied by someone else; it’s not occupied
10 by them, which is a complete interference with their
11 rights of ownership.
12

It is true that they received a sort of

13 compensation in the form of transferable development
14 rights.

But it is also clear that the Court did not

15 have any conception — or didn’t decide that that
16 constituted full value or payment.
17

I would suggest that that is a case of

18 permanent occupancy of the Penn Central space without
19 the payment of just compensation, because the Court
20 concluded on the balance of all the factors involved
21 this was the kind of regulation which did not constitute
22 a taking.
23

QUESTION:

Is that any more permanent

24 occupancy than any zoning ordinance that says you can
25 only use a portion of your property?

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

SR. GRISWOLD*

Well, I think I could cite

2 zoning ordinances as another instance.

Indeed, this all

3 goes back to Bundt against Illinois, which in 1877
4 decided that the taking provision of the Fifth Amendment
5 does not prevent — or of the Fourteenth Amendment —
6 does not prevent a state from regulating substantially
7 to the extent of taking away a large share of the
8 profits of a business.
9

Sow, we have a number of other instances.

The

10 Section 50(c) of the Sew York Multiple Dwelling Law
11 provides that the landlord must allow the tenants to
12 organize and provide a doorman in the building.

The

13 doorman occupies some of the landlord's space, for which
14 he receives no compensation.
15

There is an interesting passage by Mr. Justice

16 Brandeis —
17

QUESTION*

That's a security measure too, I

18 take it, isn't it?
19

MR. GRISWOLD*

20 tenants who do this.
21 it.

It's only the — it's only the

The landlord is not required to do

It has to do with security.

But I don't think

22 these things are — certainly Penn Central had nothing
23 to do with security.
24

That related to something else.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think your time has

25 expired now, Mr. Griswold.

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. GRISWOLD*

Can I just read one quotation

2 from Justice Brandeis?
3

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

4

MR. GRISWOLD*

One quotation, yes.

This is on page 33 of our

5 brief, the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad.

It

6 had to do with a city ordinance providing a taxi stand
7 on railroad land.

The Court held that that ordinance

8 was invalid.
9

But Mr. Justice Brandeis said that if "the

10 town should pass an ordinance establishing, on the
11 driveway, a taxi stand available only to incoming
12 passengers, I see no reason why, under the contract
13 between it and the railroad or under the general laws of
14 New Jersey, it may not do so."
15

And we suggest that that is the sort of

16 earmark, of a use-dependent regulation, that this
17 regulation here depends upon the use of the property for
18 rental purposes, and that it should be sustained.
19

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Do you have anything

20 further, Mr. Gruen?
21

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL S. GRUEN, ESQ.

22
23

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MR. GRUEN*

If I may for a few minutes.

First

24 let me take up a couple of areas where Mr. Griswold and
25 we agree.

One is that I also would like to argue the

U6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

telephone case, bat on the other side
The second is more germane to this case.

2

Mr.

3

Griswold has proposed that if trunk lines were installed

4

under the auspices of Section 828 that would probably be

5

unconstitutional, but that he distinguishes between

6

trunk lines and feeder lines.
We of course agree that such installation of

7

8 trunk lines would be unconstitutional, but I think we
9

differ on the facts.

Let me demonstrate to you, if you

10

will take a look at joint appendix page 166, just what a

11

crossover is, what a block circuit installation is.
This diagram on page 166 illustrates a typical

12

13

New York City block and a typical installation by

14

Teleprompter.

15

diagram, the cable enters at number 118 Riverside

16

Drive.

17

on West 84th Street and it goes down along Riverside

18

Drive from 118 to 110 Riverside Drive, and than along

19

the lower rung of buildings on West 83rd Street,

In the upper left-hand corner of the

It then continues about halfway around the block

20 occasionally crossing back to the buildings on 84th
21

22

Street to provide service there.
What this diagram shows is a trunk line, in my

23

opinion, what I would call a trunk line.

This diagram

24

shows that the typical installation is the use of

25

rooftops of buildings in New York as if they were a

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

public highway.

There is an easement there, by all

2 traditional definitions of what an easement is, to
3

provide service to buildings by dropping feeder lines

4

from that trunks line along the roof to individual

5

apartments and buildings.

6
7

There has been discussion about the Attorney
General providing in Mew York that a tenant is entitled

8 to receive telephone service if he wants, the telephone
9

company may be required to condemn it.

He of course

10

don't deny for a minute that the legislature in New York

11

may require the provision of cable television service.

12

Shat we say is that, just like in the case of

13

telephone service, it requires condemnation or

14

compensation in the form of rental payments for the use

15

of our property.

16

Nr. Griswold suggested that the labor cases,

17

such as Babcock S Wilcox, allow absolutely free entry by

18

organizers onto private property.

19

this is slightly inaccurate.

I would suggest that

What these cases provide

20 -- particularly I refer you to Central Hardware and
21

Babcock & Wilcox — is that where the owner of the

22 property has situated it in such a way that it's
23

inaccessible — his employees are inaccessible by any

24

means other than a temporary entry by union organizers

25

for the limited duration of an organizational campaign,

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

than he has taken steps which modify his property right

2 to the extent that he is in effect creating a nuisance

3 his injurying outsiders by not permitting their entry
4 for very limited purposes onto his property.
5
6 here.

I would submit that this is not the case
There is no necessity.

Communications can

7 proceed quite freely to tenants absent cable television#
8 by mail# telephone, any other method.

9

Thank you vary much.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

Thank you, gentlemen.

11

The case is submitted.

12

(Whereupon, at 3*06 p.m., the case in the

13 above-entitled matter was submitted.)
