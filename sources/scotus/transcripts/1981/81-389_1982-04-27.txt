ORAL ARGUMENT OF T. RICHARD KENNEDY, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
MR. KENNEDY*

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court*
These consolidated actions arise from a health

11
12

insurance company's use of peer review in the State of

13

New York.

14

Insurance Company, referred certain claims for

15

reimbursement for chiropractic treatment to a peer

16

review committee of the Petitioner New York State

17

Chiropractic Association.

Specifically my client, Union Labor Life

The referrals were necessary because the

18
19

company in its experience was not familiar with the type

20

of treatment rendered or the medical necessity of that

21

treatment.

22

coverage to treatment that is medically necessary and

23

fees which are reasonable and customary within a

24

particular community, it was necessary for my client to

25

obtain professional advice from the peer review

And since the policy specifically limits the

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

committee of the chiropractic association.
Now, these terms of the policy which I

3

mentioned are approved by the superintendent of

4

insurance of the State of New York under extensive

5

regulation of insurance in our state.

6

Peer review, chiropractic peer review, arose

7

in the early 1970's at the time that New York State

8

insurance law was amended to require health insurance

9

companies to provide to policyholders reimbursement for

10

chiropractic treatment as well as medical treatment.

11

And therefore it became necessary for the companies to

12

honor all claims for chiropractic treatment and to

13

obtain the professional advice which I had mentioned.

14

Respondent Alexander Pireno, a licensed

15

chiropractor in the State of New York, brought this

16

action in 1976 under the Sherman Act, alleging

17

conspiracy in restraint of trade in the peer review

18

arrangement between the insurance company and the peer

19

review committee of the state chiropractic association.

20

After two years of extensive discovery in the case, it

21

became obvious that the only activity of the peer review

22

committee was advising the insurance company as to

23

whether the treatment rendered was medically necessary

24

or as to whether the fees charged were within the range

25

of reasonable and customary charges in the particular

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

community* and that Onion Labor Life Insurance Company

2

was using that advice in determining the amount of

3

reimbursement to be provided to its policyholders in

4

connection with their claims for chiropractic

5

treatment.

6

Therefore, it became obvious that the Pireno

7

claim was simply that the company was using this advice

8

to interpret its policy and he was disputing the

9

company’s interpretation of the policy insofar as the

10
11
12
13

amount of benefits to be provided to the insured.
QUESTION*

What language in the policy was

being interpreted?
HR. KENNEDY*

Justice White, there were

14

specific terms in the policy that limited the extent of

15

the coverage.

16

treatment had to be medically necessary, and another was

17

that the extent of reimbursement would only be for usual

18

and customary fees and charges and reasonable charges

19

within the community.

20
21

One of the limitations was that the

QUESTION*

And are those two things precisely

what the peer review committee's attention would be

22 addressed to, the question,
23
24
25

were the services necessary*

and secondly, were the charges usual and customary?
ME. KENNEDY*
Your Honor.

Those were the usual questions,

There were additional questions.

For

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

example, the company does not provide reimbursement if

2

the treatment is beyond the scope of the chiropractor’s

3

license to practice.

4

Furthermore, if the treatment is the result of

5

a job-related accident or injury there is no coverage.

6

And sometimes it might be necessary for the company to

7 obtain professional advice in respect to those matters.
8

QUESTION:

But those — would that aspect be

9 the business of insurance?
10

HB. KENNEDY*

Yes, Your Honor.

As long as

11

it’s the interpretation of the policy and relates to the

12

extent of the insuror's obligations to the insured, we

13 say it is the business of insurance.
14

Now, we therefore moved for summary judgment

15 in the district court and that motion was granted.

The

16 district court held that, since peer review served to
17 determine the precise extent of the insurance company’s
18 obligations to the policyholders and since it
19 determined, it helped to determine, the rights of the
20

insured under the policy, that this was what this Court

21

has held the core of the business of insurance.

22

this Court so held that in the National Securities case

And

23 and in the Royal Drug case decided in 1979.
24

The court held also, the district court held

25 also here, that this —

QUESTION*

In your view, are they in effect

2

appraisers in terms of the value of the services?

3

they function as appraisers, in other words?

4

MR. KENNEDY*

Do

Mr. Chief Justice, I think there

5

is an analogy there.

The appraiser is an expert in a

6

sense with respect to, say, automobile damage and the

7

reasonable cost of getting that damage repaired.

8

too are the chiropractors experts in the field of

9

treatment.

And so

And it would be unreasonable to expect the

10
11

insurance company to have this medical expertise on its

12

staff, and therefore it’s necessary for them to go to

13

these professionals to get this type of professional

14

input•
QUESTION*

15
16

Are arrangements like this common

in the industry?
MR. KENNEDY*

17

Yes, they are. Justice Brennan.

18

I think that’s indicated by the number of amici we have

19

here.

20
21

QUESTION *

Hell, what — are you relying on

McCarran-Ferguson?

22

MR. KENNEDY*

23

QUESTION*

24
25

That’s correct. Your Honor.

And McCarran-Ferguson says that no

state law will be invalidated because?
MR. KENNEDY*

Hell, McCarran-Ferguson says

7

ALOERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that the antitrust laws are will apply to the business

2

of insurance — will not apply to the business of

3

insurance to the extent that that business is regulated

4

by the state.

5

business is regulated by the state very extensively.

And here's there's no question that the

6

QUESTIONS

7

particular respect?
MR. KENNEDY:

8
9

Hell, is it regulated in this

He claim it is. Justice Hhite.

The Respondent and the Attorney General say that since

10

the state law and regulation doesn't mention peer review

11

specifically that there is no specific regulation.

12

QUESTION:

Hell, does it regulate how the

13

company will interpret necessary and usual and

14

customary?

15

MR. KENNEDY:

The New York State law requires

16

the insurance commissioner to supervise the adjustment

17

of losses such as these health insurance reimbursement

18

claims, and the statute requires the insurance company

19

to adopt standards providing for the reasonable and

20

prompt resolution of these claims.

21

company is required under state law to make prompt

22

investigation any time they have a question.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

And the insurance

Do those procedures have to be

submitted to the insurance commissioner for approval?
MR. KENNEDY:

The insurance commissioner,

policy wording.

3

covering adjustment of losses and he has established a

4

complaint bureau within the insurance department.

5

He approves the

He has adopted detailed regulations

QUESTION;

Are those regulations in any way —

6

can they be read to authorize this kind of peer review

7

that your client adopted?

8
9

HR. KENNEDY;

I think they may be read to

require peer review.

10

QUESTION;

They require it?

11

HR. KENNEDY;

Because the — not specifically,

12

it doesn't mention peer review, of course.

13

require the insurance company to make a prompt

14

investigation and a complete review and analysis of the

15

claim, and if the company does not have the expertise on

16

its staff to determine —

17

QUESTION;

But it does

I take it if you did have the

18

expertise on your staff and did this with your own staff

19

employees, there'd be no question it would be business

20

of insurance?

21

HR. KENNEDY;

I think the Respondent and the

22

Attorney General both concede that fact, that if the

23

chiropractors were on the staff that there would be no

24

problem, because this would be a determination wholly

25

within the company and they would not be going outside

2

QUESTION;

3

Brennan confuses me a little.

4

different result of they had a psychiatrist and a

5

chiropractor and a general practitioner of medicine on

6

the staff, to whom these matters were referred?

7

you'd have a different result?
MR. KENNEDY;

8

9

Hell, your answer to Justice
You mean there'd be a

Then

Then I think it's conceded by

Respondent and amici that in those circumstances the

10

exemption provided by the McCarran-Ferguson Act would

11

apply.

12

13

QUESTION*

You think they concede that or that

it'd be perfectly obvious there wouldn't be a violation

14 of the antitrust laws?
15

HR. KENNEDY*

16

QUESTION*

17

MR. KENNEDY*

18

QUESTION*

Hell —

Or both?
I don't want —

Well, could I ask you, the

19

McCarran-Ferguson Act, Section 2, Section (a) of Section

20

2, says that the business of insurance shall be subject

21

to the laws of the several states which relate to the

22

regulation or taxation of such business.

23

says no Act of Congress is to be construed to

Then in (b) it

24 invalidate, impair, or supersede any law.
25

Now, you're saying that there is a law in the

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

state that would be superseded if the antitrust laws

2

were to apply?

3

MB. KENNEDY:

We contend, Your Honor, that

4

it’s not necessary for us to show that the law of the

5

state would be superseded.

6

history here and a review of the debate in Congress will

7

show quite clearly that what both the House and the

8

Senate intended was that if an insurance — if the state

9

regulated the business of insurance the antitrust laws

10

were not to apply, period.
QUESTION:

11
12

13

I think the legislative

You mean regulated insurance in any

way?
HH. KENNEDY:

As long as they regulate the

14

particular activity involved.

15

there’s detailed regulation of claims adjustment, as

16

there is in New York State, then the antitrust laws

17

should not be imposed on top of that type of

18

regulation.

19

QUESTION:

For example, where

Despite — you don’t even have to

20

show that the application of the antitrust laws would

21

impair the state law?

22

MR. KENNEDY:

I think, Your Honor, you only

23

have to show that there is regulation and supervision by

24

the insurance superintendent.

25

QUESTION:

Have we got cases here to that

4

Honor.

5

exemption, which are quite different than an explicit

6

exemption that was granted here by Congress.

You do have it in other areas of implied

QUESTION*

7

Are the conclusions of the peer

8

review group binding on the insuror or are they merely

9

advisory?
HR. KENNEDY*

10

They’re not binding, Mr. Chief

11

Justice.

And I think the Department of Justice, after

12

reviewing the record in this case, has conceded that in

13

their brief, that these determinations are not binding.

14

They are only advisory and all the peer review committee

15

is doing is advising the company with respect to the

16

limitations of the policy.
QUESTION*

17

Mr. Kennedy, the New York law in

18

this field basically does not require peer review, does

19

it?
MR. KENNEDY*

20
21

That’s correct. Justice

O’Connor, it does not require it.
QUESTION*

22

And it really isn’t, the peer

23

review itself, is not supervised, is it, pursuant to

24

state law?

25

MR. KENNEDY*

Hell, there is no precise

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

wording in the statute which says peer review.

2
3

QUESTION*

It just — the New York law

prohibits unfair claims practices?

4

MR. KENNEDY*

That's correct.

And if a

5

policyholder feels that he or she is not getting full

6

reimbursement to which they are entitled under the

7

policy, then they have the right to complain to the

8

insurance department, and there's an elaborate procedure

9 for this.
10
11

There's a complaint bureau in the

department.
That was not done here, apparently, by any of

12 Pireno's patients.

And furthermore, Pireno had a remedy

13 in that he could have taken an assignment of any of his
14

insured patients' claims against the company and made a

15 claim to the insurance department under this process
16

that I mentioned.

He apparently failed to do that.

He

17 came forward with no evidence that he had tried that.
18

QUESTION*

How do you distinguish the holding

19 in the Royal Drug case, which really gave rather a
20 restrictive definition of the business of insurance?
21

NR. KENNEDY*

Hell, Justice O'Connor, the

22 Royal Drug case involved provider agreements and what
23

those provider agreements intended was a price-fixing

24

with respect to goods to be sold to policyholders under

25 a separate arrangement, entirely separate arrangement

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

with the insurance company.

2

than here, where the insurance company is only getting

3

advice from the peer review committee and there is no

4

fixing of fees.

5

whatever the chiropractor wishes to charge to the

6

policyholder•

7

Now, that's quite different

The chiropractor remains free to charge

Dr. Pireno can — in fact, the record here

8

discloses that Dr. Pireno claims no loss of income and

9

no loss of patients as a result of peer review.

10

The chiropractor can deal with the patient,

11

charge whatever he would like to charge, and deal on

12

whatever terms he wishes.

13

at Royal Drug, where the participating pharmacy had to

14

charge a specific charge set out in the agreement.

15

There's no contract here for the purchase of goods.

16

That's quite different than

And even under a restrictive interpretation of

17

HcCarran-Ferguson we say this should be the business of

18

insurance because it involves the spreading of risk.

19

the district court held here, this process determines to

20

what extent the policyholder is going to have to bear

21

the loss, the entire loss, or whether the insurance

22

company is going to take a good part of that loss or the

23

entire loss.

24
25

As

To the extent the insurance company takes the
entire loss, then that risk and loss has to be spread

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

among all policyholders in the form of higher premiums.

2

Furthermore, peer review helps the insurance company

3

determine what are the reasonable and customary charges

4

that it*s going to encounter in this field of its

5

business.

6

not only the frequency, the number of times you’re going

7

to have a claim under the policy, but also calculating

8

the likely magnitude of those losses.

9

insurance company gathers information, as it’s doing

A good part of underwriting is calculating

And unless the

10

here through the peer review committee, as to what the

11

likely fees to be encountered are, then it has no way of

12

estimating the amount of premium and rates that it

13

should charge and file with the insurance department.
QUESTION;

14

Doesn't it get some information of

15

that kind just by paying claims?

16

HR. KENNEDY:

Yes, sir, yes, it does.

As a

17

matter of fact, the insurance company handles most of

18

these claims without consulting a peer review

19

committee.

20

experience.

They are able to act on their own

21

It*s only when they encounter the difficult

22

claim, the unusual treatment, the extensive amount of

23

treatment that isn’t normally experienced, that they go

24

to the peer review committee.

25

conceded in the Department of Justice brief, where they

And I think that’s

2

say it's vary rarely used, the peer review process.
QUESTION:

Mr. Kennedy, the Solicitor

3

General's argument is even if you are in the business of

4

insurance, even if this is business of insurance, you're

5

still not regulated by New York law, the other

6

requirement of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

7

addressed this a little earlier, but would you mind just

8

telling me what are the statutes you rely on that you

9

are regulated in this respect?

10

MR. KENNEDY:

Yes, Your Honor.

I know you

That is

11

briefed in both our main brief and our reply brief.

12

There is a statute regulating extensively the claims

13

adjustment process, and that's a law enacted not only in

14

New York but most all states.

15

QUESTION*

Now, how does that regulate this

16

peer review procedure?

17

MR. KENNEDY*

Well, that requires the

18

insurance company, as I said before, to make a prompt

19

investigation of a claim and to settle a claim

20

expeditiously and fairly.

21

therefore has to gather information and has to go to

22

professionals where it does not have that information,

23

and that's what it's doing here.

24
25

And the insurance company

Again, if the insurance company fails in these
obligations then it’s subject to sanction by the

license.

3

particular lack of reimbursement can go to the insurance

4

department complaint bureau set up for this and make a

5

complaint against the company.

And a policyholder that feels aggrieved in any

As I said before, the chiropractor also can go

6
7

to the insurance department simply by taking an

8

assignment of his insured patient's claim against the

9

company.

bureau.

13

it?

What does the insurance department do about

HR. KENNEDY;

14

What does the — or complaint

Well, Justice Rehnquist, that is

15

not in this record simply because Dr. Pireno's patients

16

did not go to the insurance department and he didn't go

17

himself.

18

the insurance department staff makes an investigation,

19

an extensive investigation.

20

they contact the doctor, the policyholder, and they get

21

all the facts and they make a final determination.

22
23

However, as a matter of fact what happens is

They contact the company,

Sometimes these things are done for a matter
of several dollars by way of reimbursement.

24

QUESTION;

25

the company to pay?

Do they enter an order directing

1

HR. KENNEDY;

Yes.

It’s not an order in the

2

sense of an administrative order.

3

a letter sent to the company saying that, you have not

4

complied with the statute and the regulations in that

5

you didn't fairly adjust this loss.
QUESTION;

6

It's just ordinarily

In New York have licenses been

either cancelled or failed renewal because of the way

8

claims were handled, as has happened in some states?

9

just wonder what New York's is, since New York is the

10

pattern for so much of this legislation.
MR. KENNEDY;

11

I would not be surprised if that

12

were true, Mr. Chief Justice, but I don't know of

13

personal knowledge.

sanctions imposed upon companies for failure to adjust

15

losses as required by the statute and by the

16

superintendent's regulations.

But I know there have been

Mr. Kennedy, is your position — it

schedule of these they would consider reasonable and

that.
MR. KENNEDY*

10

Justice Stevens, the type of

review the peer review committee is asked to undertake

is really not susceptible to a fee schedule, because

it's not the routine claims.

the insurance company could deal with it through its own

experience.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN M. JENKINS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT PIRENO
MS. JENKINS*

Hr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
This case involves a claim for exemption from

23

the antitrust laws under the McCarran-Ferguson Act not

24

only by an insurance company. Union Labor Life, but also

25

by a non-insurance entity, a group of health care

Both Union Labor Life and the Chiroprctic Association

4

constitutes the business of insurance under Section 2(b)

5 of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
6

QUESTION»

What would be your view of the

7 matter if the people conducting the peer review were
8

employed by the insurer?

9

MS. JENKINS*

Our position on that# Mr. Chief

10

Justice# would be that there would probably not be a

11

violation, because it would all be in house and there

12

would not be a conspiracy among chiropractors.

As to

13 the McCarran-Ferguson issue# we think that Royal Drug
14 expresses three tests for the business federal
15 insurance*

One is whether or not risk-spreading or

16 underwriting are involved; the second is whether or not
17 the relationship between the insurer and insured is
18 involved; and the third is whether or not parties
19 outside of the insurance industry are involved.
20

Now# if it were an in-house chiropractor it

21

would satisfy the third test, but not necessarily the

22

first or second.

23

But what we —

QUESTION*

What do you see as the functional

24 difference between the peer review chiropractor who is
25 on the outside and one who is on the staff?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

HS. JENKINS;

Well, as to the merits of the

2

case. Your Honor, as to whether or not it*s a violation

3

of the antitrust laws, there would be no conspiracy if

4

it were an in-house employee of the insurance company.

5

As far as the HcCarran-Ferguson Act is concerned, I

6

think there probably is not much of a functional

7

difference whether it’s in-house or not.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION;

Well, wouldn't the in-house

specialists be a little more inclined to follow the
orders of his master?
HS. JENKINS;

Well, the insurance company has

12

access already to all their claims experience

13

information.

14

information is already available to them to base their

15

decisions on claims on.

16

to a large extent.

17

And as Hr. Kennedy agreed, that kind of

So it's already done in-house

The peer review committee may have interests

18

adverse to the insurance company, but we don't think

19

they do in this case.

20

We contend that it is important to recognize,

21

as this Court emphasized in Royal Drug, that when

22

exemptions from the antitrust laws are sought they must

23

be narrowly construed, and a statutory exemption should

24

be limited to the scope that was clearly intended by

25

Congress and to the market in which Congress intended to

26

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

displace competition with regulation, here the insurance

2

market.

3

The market in which the chiropractors compete

4

is the chiropractic market and that is where the

5

restraint has occurred in this case.

6

insurance supervisor does not regulate chiropractors.

7

Peer review is not regulated by New York State law.

8

the New York State insurance department would have no

9

power over the kinds of restraints that are going on

10

The New York State

here.
QUESTION:

11

Ms. Jenkins, what if instead of

12

referring this matter to a peer review committee of

13

chiropractors the company had referred it to retained

14

counsel?

15

lawyers are regulated by the New York courts and the

16

state bar and therefore they're not within the

17

exemption?

18

Would you use the same argument, saying that

MS. JENKINS:

No, Your Honor.

I would say

19

that the lawyers are not regulated by the New York

20

insurance department,and therefore they're not within

21

the HcCarran-Ferguson exemption.

22
23
24
25

And

QUESTION:

Even though they were asked to

construe a term of the policy?
MS. JENKINS:

Well, I wouldn't — that

wouldn't necesssarily violate the antitrust laws, but it

1

certainly would not be the business of insurance.

2

Otherwise, everyone that an insurance company goes to to

3

seek any kind of services in connection with its

4

business would be exempted from the antitrust laws and

5

it would begin to affect many other markets besides the

6

insurance market.

7

QUESTION*

I would have thought that might

8

have been within the definition in SEC versus National

9

Securities.

10
11

Do you think Royal Drug narrowed the

definition in National Securities?
MS. JENKINS*

I think Royal Drug emphasizes an

12

additional test beyond the one in National Securities in

13

that Royal Drug speaks about the underwriting and

14

risk-spreading element of insurance, which Royal Drug

15

says is an indispensable characteristic of insurance.

16
17
18

QUESTION*

It didn’t say that was the only

thing that was going to —
MS. JENKINS*

No.

National Securities is part

19

of another test, which is the relationship between the

20

insurer and insured.

21

the relationship between the insurance company and its

22

stockholders, rather than policyholders.

23

In Royal Drug the merger involved

We contend that the contract, the agreement to

24

perform peer review between the New York State

25

Chiropractic Association and the insurance company is

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

with the pharmacy agreements in the Royal Drug case.

The

we believe that that interpretation of the relationship

insured is what governs in this situation.

9

QUESTION*

From what you have said and what

10

your friend has said/ the Petitioner could solve all

11

these problems by simply taking the same chiropractors

who are now being used as peer review committees and

13

write them a letter and say, we hereby appoint you on

14

our staff, review staff, and we'll pay you $25 or $50 or

15

whatever, or pay them nothing.

16

solve the problem, wouldn't it?

17

MS. JENKINS:

18

would, because to the extent —

That would apparently

Your Honor, no, I don't think it

Well then, that isn't consistent

with what you responded earlier, that if they were

MS. JENKINS:

5

8

presumably.
NS. JENKINS*

9

They aren't competitors,

Well, they might be, to the

10

extent that there's any interstate movement.

But no,

11

they're not directly competitors in the same extent, and

12

there would probably not be the same type of antitrust

13

violation of they had not been direct competitors of Dr.

14

Pireno.
However, I still don't think that it would

1516

have been the business of insurance.

17

history of the McCarran-Ferguson Act shows that what

18

Congress was concerned about were the competition and

19

the stringent regulation in the insurance market, and it

20

wished to preserve state regulation of the insurance

21

market.

22

concerned, with competition in the markets in which

23

insurors function as buyers.

24

with providers, it's basically there as a buyer of goods

25

3

the competition that's allegedly affected in the

4

complaint is the competition that was intended to be

5

displaced by regulation under the McCarran-Ferguson

6

Act.
We think that there are — contend that there

7

8

are several points on which this case is governed by and

9

is similar to Royal Drug.

In the first place, it's an

10

agreement with providers by the insurance company which

11

the insurer enters into in order to contain its costs,

12

just as the Blue Shield plan did in Royal Drug.

13

might be part of the business of insurance companies to

14

that extent, like other arrangements for the purchase of

15

goods and services, but it's not the business of

tha contract between the insurer and the insured.

2

it involves parties outside of the insurance industry

3

and outside of the contract between the provider and —

4

between the insurer and the insured.

5

And

We also would like to stress that there are a

6

number of respects in which the provider agreements here

7

are even less the business of insurance than they were

8

in Royal Drug.

9

a Blue Shield plan whose policies themselves promised

In the first place. Royal Drug concerned

10

and provided the services that were being offered, that

11

is a service benefit contract, whereas here only

12

indemnity contracts are involved, money benefits to

13

reimburse the insured.

14

The provider contracts in Royal Drug at least

15

contemplated that some kind of provider agreements would

16

be entered into.

17

by the union management who were involved in the group

18

contracts that Blue Shield offered that had pharmacy

19

agreements, whereas here the agreement with New York

20

State Chiropractic Association is neither necessary nor

21

related to the insurer's efforts to satisfy its

22

obligations to its policyholders, because there are

23

other means whereby the insurer could get the same kind

24

of advice and information.

25

In fact, they were expressly requested

4

services.

5

then persuaded or were joined voluntarily by Onion Labor

6

Life.

The providers agreed among themselves and

And we think this makes this case even less the

7 business of insurance than Boyal Drug.
8

With respect to the state regulation issue, I

9 would like to point out that, first, it would not be
10

necessary to reach this issue in order to affirm the

11

Second Circuit, but it has been briefed by the parties

12

and we believe that Hew York State does not regulate

13 peer review practices of chiropractors at all, and it
14 does not regulate this particular practice to the extent
15 that is required for McCarran-Ferguson immunity.
16

Furthermore, the first section of — the first

17 part of Section 2(b) is particularly appropriate,
18 because there is no law of Hew York State that would be
19 impaired or invalidated or superseded if peer review is
20
21

simply made subject to federal antitrust laws.
Furthermore, because the peer review committee

ORAL ARGUMENT OF B. BARRY GROSSMAN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. GROSSMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The two courts below construed the complaint

2

to allege a conspiracy which eliminated competition in

alleged competitive restraint is not the business of

In the

It doesn't satisfy any of the functional or

8

analytical criteria articulated in this Court's

9

decisions.

Moreover, as we indicated in our brief, the

10

challenged restraint in the chiropractic market does not

satisfy the criteria established in either the opinion

12

of the majority or that of the dissent in Royal Drug,

13

low, in view of the short time available I

14
15

wont try to repeat that brief in necessarily abbreviated

16

form.

17

"business of insurance" from a historical perspective,

18

for after all the various criteria articulated by the

19

courts, whether it's spreading risk or relationship to

20

the policy, are but means to an end, and that end is of

21

course to ascertain whether Congress intended a

22

restraint of the type alleged here, namely in a provider

23

market, a non-insurance market, to be entitled to the

24

exemption that it had provided for the business of

25

insurance•

Instead, I'd like to address the critical words

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The McCarran-Ferguson Act of course was passed

2

in response to this Court's decision in Southeastern

3

Underwriters, and there is considerable evidence that

4

Congress was attempting to undo some, but not all, of

5

the changes that that decision was thought to have

6

brought about.

7

majority held that the Sherman Act encompassed alleged

8

restraints among insurers in the writing of insurance

9

policies.

In Southeastern Underwriters the

All the members of the Court recognized that

10
11

the interstate communications and transportation

12

incidental to the writing of insurance policies were

13

sufficient to fall within the commerce clause.

14

Chief Justice Stone in his dissent sought to distinguish

15

between the local and thn interstate aspects of

16

insurance company activities, and he referred to the

17

former as the business of insurance.

But

And in developing his limited notion of the

18
19

business of insurance which should be left to state

20

primacy, the Chief Justice addressed the issue raised in

21

this case.

22

pages 570 and 7 of volume 322, where you will see that

23

the Chief Justice stated that if contracts of insurance

24

are in fact made the instrument of restraint in the

25

marketing of goods or services, they are not beyond the

And I just direct the Court's attention to

1

reach of the Sherman Act.

2

in interstate commerce may nevertheless he used as the

Contracts not in themselves

3 means of its restraint.
4

Similarly# Justice Jackson in his dissent

5 expressed the view at page 587 that if competition in
6

goods and services other than insurance were restrained

7 by insurance company activities that conduct would be
8

subject to the Sherman Act.

How# since the majority of

9 the Court felt the Sherman Act applied to the actual
10

writing of insurance policies, it can be assumed that

11

they too deemed the federal law applicable to restraints

12

in non-insurance markets effectuated through insurance

13 company activities.
14

Thus it could be said that the entire Court in

15 Southeastern Underwriters was of the view that conduct
16 involving an insurance company would be subject to the
17 Sherman Act if it restrained competition in
18 non-insurance markets.
19

QUESTION*

I don't think that was Justice

20

Frankfurter's view# was it?

Didn't he think that the

21

Congress in 1890 had in mind the Paul decision and

22 didn't intend it to reach —

23

That was a view held by Justice

24 Frankfurter, but he joined the dissent. Chief Justice

If not, then one member

This unanimity or consensus I suggest is

7

critical to ascertaining what Congress* intent was with

8

respect to non-insurance restraints of the type alleged

9

in this case, for it indicates the legal status quo ante

10

to which the drafters of the McCarran Act looked.

11

we all realize that the legislative history reveals

12

considerable disagreement as to how much of the

13

exclusive power of insurance thought to reside in the

14

states as a result of Paul v. Virginia should be

15

returned to the states.

16

How,

Now, it's clear that Congress gave back some

17

of that power, but not all.

But more important to the

18

facts of this case is that there is nothing in the

19

statutory language, the legislative reports, or the

20

Congressional debates to indicate any Congressional

21

intent to create a broader exemption from federal

22

antitrust law for insurance-related activities than was

23

thought to exist prior to Southeastern Underwriters; and

24

that, since the Court's aversion to this distinction

25

between insurance restraints and non-insurance

42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

restraints can be presumed to have been known to the

2

Congress, this silence is extremely important.

3

For there is absolutely no evidence in any of

4

the sources that I have referred to that Congress

5

desired to expand the antitrust primacy of the states to

6

include non-insurance goods and services.

7

contrary, they used the limited term "business of

8

insurance" rather than some broader term, "business of

9

insurers" or "conduct, transactions, restraints, related

different, an opposite view from that taken here today

it said in SEC versus Variable Annuity, that insurance

5

I’d like to point out further what Justice

6

Brennan cited in his dissent in the Royal Drug case,

that Congress considered a bill which would have limited

agreements between insurance companies and related only

That was Senate Bill 12, introduced in
