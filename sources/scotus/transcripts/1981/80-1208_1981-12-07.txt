ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, ESQ.,

11

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT IN NO.

12

MR. HUNTINGTON:

13 please the Court,

80-1208

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

these condsolidated cases are here on

14 appeals from the Supreme Court of New Hampshire.
15 issues are whether

The key

New Hampshire’s restriction on

16 hydroelectric exports places an undue burden on interstate
17 commerce in

violation of the commerce clause,

and whether

18 the restriction is pre-empted by the Federal Power Act.
19

The facts are straightforward.

New England Power

20 Company is part of a holding company system that serves
21 customers in Rhode Island,

Massachusetts, and New

22 Hampshire.

It owns several hydroelectric units along the

23 Connecticut

River located in New Hampshire.

Energy from

24 these units is delivered to an integrated regional
25 transmission grid and flows freely in interstate commerce.

U

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

In 1980,

the New Hampshire Public Utilities

2 Commission invoked a 1913 state statute and ordered New
3 England Power Company to sell within New Hampshire the
4 output from the units.

The Commission did not order NEP to

5 interrupt physically the way the power is being generated or
6 transmitted.

Father, it sought to capture exclusively for

7 the benefit of New Hampshire citizens the economic benefits
8 of these units.
9

New Hampshire's attempt to retain the economic

10 benefits of an important natural resource exclusively for
11 its own citizens violates the commerce clause.

There are

12 two mainstream cases by this Court which are directly on

13 point.

West versus Kansas Natural Gas Company involved a

14 state prohibition against the export of natural gas.

And in

15 a case even more on point, in Pennsylvania against West
16 Virginia, this Court struck down a statute that required

17 natural gas companies to serve local needs first, before
18 exporting any natural gas.
19

QUESTION;

So you say that the Federal Power Act

20 of *35 doesn't either hinder or help you, or at any rate you
21 don ' t need it?
22

MS. HUNTINGTON;

Well, our commerce clause

23 argument is based on the commerce clause itself.

In

24 addition to that we have a pre-emption argument that the New
25 Hampshire restriction is pre-empted by the Federal Power Act

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, New Hampshire seeks to rebut our commerce

2 clause araument by relying on Section 201(b) of the Federal
3 Power Act, so the Federal Power Act is involved in our

4 commerce clause argument to that extent.

And I would like

5 to turn now to that clause.
New Hampshire's argument is that that is an

6

7 affirmative grant of authority, and therefore Congress
8 affirmatively authorized them to burden interstate commerce.

QUESTION:

What is, Mr. Huntington?

MR. HUNTINGTON:

Section 201(b) of the Federal

Let me turn immediately to the language of that

12 section, which I think itself is dispositive.

MR. HUNTINGTON:

This is at Page

19 of our

brief.

Thank you.
"The provisions of Part

2 shall

18 not deprive a state or a state commission of its lawful
19 authority now exercised over the exportation of
20 hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a state

21 line."

The question is, is this a grant, and we submit that

22 the words "shall not deprive" are flatly inconsistent with a
23 grant.

These are not words of grant.

"Lawful authority now

24 exericsed" is certainly not a reference to new authority
25 heretofore barred by the commerce clause.

QUESTION;

1

What do you make of Congressman

2 Rodgers’ comment?
MR. HUNTINGTON;

3

Congressman Rodgers may have

4 thought that the state had lawful authority to restrict
5 hydroelectric exports.

What Congressman Rodgers said is,

6 allow us to continue to exercise these rights which
7 have.

we

Congress's reaction to that was to enact 2 1(b),

8 which is a savings clause.

Congress said, all right,

9 whatever lawful authority you now have you can continue to
1

exercise, no more, no less.

11

The context of Section 2 1(b) is also flatly

12 inconsistent with reading that -13

QUESTION;

Counsel, what do you think that clause

14 saved for New Hampshire?
15

MR. HUNTINGTON;

16 Hampshire had.
17

It saved whatever authority New

Now, we don't think the Court needs --

QUESTION;

What authority did it have?

As a

18 practical matter, what did that clause save, in your view,
19 for New Hampshire?
20

NR. HUNTINGTON;

Well, in fact, it may have saved

21 nothing.

We don't think the Court needs to reach that

22 issue, because I think there may be a category of cases
23 where the Court could restrict hydroelectric exports in
24 order to meet a local emergency or need, and we do address
25 that in our brief.

MR. HUNTINGTON;

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. HUNTINGTON;

No, there is another provision --

As opposed to wholesale?
There is another provision in

7 Section 201(b) that says that the authority of the Federal
8 Energy Regulatory Commission extends to wholesale sales, but

9 to no other sales, and that would take care of the retail
10 sales.

11
12 here.

I think the context of Section 201(b) is important
Part 2 of the Federal Power Act was passed following

13 the Attleboro decision, which held squarely that interstate
14 flows of electricity are subject to the protection of the
15 commerce clause, and that regulating wholesale sales in
16 interstate commerce is beyond the power of the states.

Now,

17 Congress's reaction to that decision was not to create new
18 authority, not to delegate to the authority affirmative —
19 to the states affirmative power to regulate wholesale
20 sales.

Congress's power was -- Congress's reaction was to

21 observe federal-state constitutional lines to give the
22 Federal

Power Commission, as it was then called, authority

23 over wholesale rates and to preserve to the states whatever
24 authority they had, and we submit that Section 201(b) is
25 completely consistent with

Attleboro was in 1927, so it was

MR. HUNTINGTON;

No, we are arguing first that it

is an undue burden on interstate commerce.

Why are you taking that approach?

Because we think the restriction

23

MR. HUNTINGTON:

No.

No, no.

9 first question the Court must address is, is it an

11 savings clause,

If it is a

then it is not a defense to our commerce

12 clause challenge.

It is only a defense to our pre-emption

13 argument, and that is the approach that the Court used in
14 the BT Investment Managers case last year, which involved a
15 savings clause practically identical to the 201(b) savings
16 clause here.
17

The Court there held that the saving -- that it

18 was a savings clause, and it protected the Florida statute
19 there in question from pre-emption, but it was not an
20 affirmative
21 on

22

grant, and the Florida statute was struck down

commerce clause grounds.
Let me refer the Court to Section 202(f) of the

23 Federal Power Act,

which was not mentioned in our briefs,

24 but I think it is relevant here, and I brought it to Mr.
25 Smith's attention.

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

202(f), Part 2, was enacted In 1953 to make clear

2 that the Federal Power Commission's jurisdiction did not
3 extend to international sales, wholesale sales between a
4 single state and a foreign

country.

Congress in enacting

5 202(f) was concerned that these sales might then be beyond

6 either federal or state authority under the Attleboro
7 decision.

So in 202(f) Congress added a provision that

8 said, and I quote,

"The states may regulate any such

9 tra nsaction."

10

And the legislative history of 202(f), which is

11 House Report Number 978, 83rd Congress, First Session, makes

12 clear that Congress added that because they were concerned
13 that the states might not have that authority under the
14 Attleboro gap -- under the Attleboro decision.
15 an example of

So 202(f) is

a clear delegation to the states of authority

16 to regulate wholesale sales.
17 such transaction.

The states may regulate any

That stands in total contrast to 201(b),

18 which says that nothing shall deprive a state of any lawful
19 authority now exercised.

20

I would like to turn now to New Hampshire's second

21 argument to avoid the commerce clause contention we make.

22 And that is that the state has a proprietary interest in the
23 river itself, and that justifies this restriction on
24 interstate commerce.

Fven if the state has a proprietary

25 interest, and we submit it does not,

that interest does not

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 justify restricting commerce in a product which is privately
2 manufactured using the river's power.
Electricity is a product generated by New England

3

4 Power Company using the river's power.

By way of analogy,

5 flour is a product that can be milled using the river’s
6 power.
7

Clearly, New Hampshire does not have the authority

under the commerce clause to restrict commerce in flour.

We

8 submit it does not have any authority to restrict commerce
9 in a privately produced product such as electricity.
10

This is the clear teaching of Foster Packing, a

11 1928 decision that says a state may not prevent privately
12 owned articles of trade from being sold in interstate
13 commerce.
14

QUESTION:

Do you think cases like that and

15 Attleboro would come out the same way today?
16

MR. HUNTINGTON:

We rely on Attleboro for the

17

proposition that electricity in interstate commerce is

18

subject to the protection of the commerce clause.

19

stands for the proposition that wholesale sales in

Attleboro

20 interstate commerce are beyond the authority of the states
21 to regulate.
22

I think there may be some question as to whether

23 all wholesale sales in interstate commerce are beyond the
24 constitutional authority.

However, the restriction we have

25 here is very akin to the Pennsylvania against West Virginia

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 decision, and that case has been reaffirmed time and time
2 again, as recently as last year in the BT Investment case,
3 in the Philadelphia against New Jersey landfill case, and
4 stands for the very solid proposition that a state cannot
5 erect a barrier to the interstate commerce of a product
6 generated from a natural resource.
7

We submit in any event that New Hampshire does not

8 have a proprietary interest in the river in the same way
9 that it owns, say, state forest lands or the state capitol
10 building.

The interest New Hampshire does have is a

11 regulatory interest.

It has an interest in seeing that the

12 resource is not wasted, it is conserved, and so on.

But

13 this Court's decision in Hughes against Oklahoma, striking
14 down a state barrier on the export of minnows, stands firmly
15 for the proposition that this ownership interest in natural
16 resources, wildlife, and so on, does not protect the state
17 regulation from commerce clause scrutiny.

The ownership

18 interest is simply the equivalent of saying, yes, the state
19 may regulate for valid conservation or waste purposes, but
20 those regulations must still pass muster under the commerce
21 clause.
22

We submit that under the core commerce clause

23 decisions of this Court, the New Hampshire restriction
24 cannot survive the commerce clause attack.
25

With the Court's permission, I would like to save

14

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS IN NO . 80-1471

AND NO. 80-1610

5

MR. STERN;

6
7

Mr. Stern.

Mr. Chief Justice, an d may it please

the Court, Massachusetts and Rhode Island a Iso contend that

8 the order of the New Hampshire Public Utili ties Commission
9

violates the commerce clause and is pre-emp ted by federal

10

statute.

We agree that Section 201(b) does not act as a

11

grant of Congressional authority, but inste ad should be

12

construed by this Court as a saving clause.
For purposes of my argument, howe ver, I will

13
14

assume a contrary interpretation of Section 201(b), and will

15

assume that Congress did in fact give to Ne w Hampshire the

16

authority to limit or ban the exportation o f hydroelectric

17

power and that the PUC's order fell within the grant of that

18

authority.

19

Such an i nterpretation would, in our view, present

20 serious Constitutio nal questions centering on the limits of
21

Congressional autho rity.

22

QUESTION:

23

Benjamin and cases like that?

24
25

MR. STERN :

What do you do with Pr udential against

Well, Your Honor, we don't dispute

that Congress can - - has broad di scretion a nd authority with

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

respect to the commerce clause, nor do we dispute that

2 Congress's authority under the commerce clause exceeds that
3

which a state might otherwise have.

In other words, this

4

case is not a case where we argue that Congress was

5

incapable of giving to the states authority which it

6

wouldn't have had in absence of Congressional authority.
What we do suggest is that that power which

7

8

Congress has and which the states willingly gave up to

9

Congress when it entered into the Constitution must be

10

exercised in a way so that the exercise of Congressional

11

power is exercised in some rational manner consistent with

12

the legitimate ends that Congress sought to achieve.

13

Now, before I pursue that question. Your Honor, I

14

want to briefly describe what we consider Massachusetts and

15

Rhode Island's interest in this litigation.

16

of course, our interest is as narrow as is New Hampshire's.

17

Any reduce! savings to New Hampshire inevitably means that

18

we pay more.
QUESTION;

19

20

On one level,

Well, and partly, too, your citizens,

according to New Hampshire, are migrating to New Hampshire.
MR. STERN;

21

Well, that is true, Your Honor.

They

22

are then becoming New Hampshire residents and New Hampshire

23

citizens.

24

the PUC's order by its very terms is to shift the economic

25

burden of some $25 million.

But what is clear is that the fiscal impact of

Our estimates exceed that

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 amount,

but we are willing to accept that at a minimum $25

2 million is being shifted from the shoulders of New Hampshire

3 residents, rather, from Massachusetts to New Hampshire, but
4 the real impact, I suggest, Your Honor, and this is, I
5 think, perhaps the primary reason we are here, exceeds and
6 transcends the dollars and cents.

The decision of the PUC threatens the

7

8 long-standing cooperative efforts of the New

9 with respect to energy matters.

England states

The New England Power Pool

10 represents perhaps this nation's most sophisticated and
11 highly integrated energy power pool arrangement.
12 arrangement,

This

however, is a finely tuned arrangement, and one

13 which, as the Commissioner of the Rhode Island PUC testified
14 at the New Hampshire hearing suggested, could unravel fairly
15 easily.
Moreover, the PUC's order invites the very sort of

16

17 economic retaliation and isolation which these same three
18 states were subject to when they were governed by the
19 Articles of Confederation,
20 clause,
21 which
22

which leads me to the commerce

or back to the commerce clause, and to the authority

the states willingly gave up to Congress.
While wa concede that this authority is expansive,

23 there are certain internal and external constraints, we
24 suggest, on Congress's power to legislate in the area.
25 intend to focus my argument on the internal constraints

1 implicated by the commerce clause, and suggest that if the
2 Court adopts New Hampshire's interpretation of Section
3 201(b), that this case then presents one of those rare

4 occasions for holding that Congress has exceeded its power
5 under the commerce clause.
6

In prior instances where the Court has been faced

7 with this argument, it has followed essentially a two-step
8 analysis.

First, whether the subject matter which Congress

9 acts falls within the broad reach of the commerce clause,
10 and here there is no dispute.

We concede that Congress had

11 the authority to regulate in the energy area generally, and
12 with respect to hydroelectric power specifically.

In fact,

13 it forms the premise of our own commerce clause claim and
14 our prep-emption claim.
15

But the second step and the second question is

16 contested here, and that is whether Congress's action is
17 reasonably related to the goal of regulating interstate
18 commerce.

This question, which is essentially a limited

19 means and ends analysis, requires that there must be some
20 showing, however minimal, that Congress has acted in a

21 rational manner, and here, it is our position that whether
22 one looks for an articulated purpose on the part of Congress
23 or indeed for any plausible reason for Congress's action,
24 none emerge to support a grant of authority to New Hampshire
25 which effectively keeps the benefits, the economic benefits

1 of hydroelectric power within her borders at the expense of
2 her sister states.
3

The fact that similar authority was not provided

4 to the vast majority of other states underscores the
5 irrationality of Congress's action.
6

QUESTION;

Well, it was a grandfathering thing,

7 according to the Congressman from New Hampshire,
8

KR. STEEN;

wasn't it?

Well, we suggest. Your Honor, that

9 labeling it as a grandfather clause in this case doesn’t
10 assist New Hampshire, for several reasons.

The first is, it

11 was a curious kind of grandfather clause, because New
12 Hampshire argues that it didn’t simply lock in lawful
13 authority.

Part of its argument is that it gave to a few

14 states authority which it didn't have before under the
15 commerce clause.

16

But secondly, we suggest that calling it a

17 grandfather clause may describe what Congressman Rodgers had
18 in

mind, but in other instances where the Court has upheld

19 the rationality of grandfather clauses it has looked to see
20 whether the locking in of the inequity , if we can call it
21 that, furthers some other rational,

some other legitimate

22 purpose which the legislature or the city council in the
23 case of New Orleans versus Duke had in mind.
24

Here, of course, it is not a temporary solution.

25 It is a -- to a national problem.

What it does is to give

1 9

400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to New Hampshire forever power, important power, within its
2 borders, this economic benefit, yet at the time same deny to
3 the rest of the union, and here specifically Massachusetts
4 and Rhode Island, this very same power.

This is not an

5 instance where Congress simply follows the problem, as it
6 did in the decision which the Court upheld last year, the

7 statute which the Court upheld last year in Hodell , where
8 Congress dealt with a problem, and after extensive hearings
9 found that although the statute, the Strip Mining Act fell
10 peculiarly upon Virginia, what Congress was doing was simply
11 following the problem wherever it found it.
12

Nor is it an instance, we suggest, as in the

13 voting rights case, the Katzenbach case, where Congress
14 selectively carves out its remedial powers in response to a
15 national problem.

Here, Massachusetts and Rhode Island find

16 themselves on the receiving end of action which we assume
17 for argument purposes but for Congressional action would
18 violate the commerce clause, yet at the same time our action

19 is judged, of course, by the higher standard of the commerce
20 clause, since we lack that Congressional grant.
21

We suggest that such an unprecedented result is

22 contrary to the very purpose of the commerce clause.
23

This Court has in the past found great meaning in

24 the silences, in the great silences of the commerce clause.
25 The Court has interpreted that provision in the name of

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 national unity and free commerce as inhibiting the states.
2 We suggest that there is another great silence in the
3 commerce clause which places certain limits on Congress,
4 admittedly very narrow ones.

Those limits at a minimum

5 preclude Congress from selectively choking off interstate
6 commerce in a manner that bears no rational relationship to

7 the purpose of the commerce clause.
QUESTION:

8

In effect, Mr. Stern, you are

9 suggesting that this statute might just as well have read,
10 State of New Hampshire.
11

ME. STERN:

Yes, it could have, Your Honor.

We

12 think that Congress can --

13

QUESTION:

That that is the only one of the 50

14 states to which it could apply?
15

MR. STERN:

Oh, no, no, Your Honor.

By mentioning

16 New Hampshire, I am focusing on the fact that it is New
17 Hampshire and her neighboring states that are before the
18

Court.

At the time the statute was passed, there were in

19 fact other states which arguably fell within 201(b).
20

QUESTION:

21

MR. STERN:

How many?
I think there were four, Your Honor,

22 and there now remain, I think, only New Hampshire and
23 Wisconsin which at all suggest that they have any
24 authority.

Wisconsin is not before the Court, so we don't

25 know what authority it suggests.

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

I ask your indulgence to treat briefly some

2 further facts which have already been referred to in the
3 earlier argument.

Section 201(b), as I think you know, provided in

4

5 fairly explicit terms that a state would not be deprived of
6 its lawful authority now exercised over the exportation of
7 hydroelectric energy which is transmitted across a state
8 line.

That Act of Congress adopted the practice then in

9 existence in four states in the union and wrote it right
10 into the law.

The hydroelectric power plants in New

11 Hampshire on the Connecticut River, which is in fact wholly
12 within New Hampshire, generate electricity without any
13 interstate character in the generation of the electricity
14 itself.
15

If there is any doubt about what that section of

16201(b)

means, the appellants have called upon the right

17 state to give the answer.
18

That section, which was an

amendment to the Federal Power Act when it proceeded through

19 Congress, was introduced, was sponsored, and shepherded
20 through Congress by representatives of the state of New
21 Hampshire.

In doing so, the Congressman from the state of

22 New Hampshire addressed his colleagues by saying, "The
23 Senate bill as originally drawn would deprive certain
24 states, I think five in all, of certain rights which they
25 have over the exportation of hydroelectric energy which is

23

It is our position, in fact, contrary to our

5 authority to control the delivery of that into the stream of
6 commerce than it would have with respect to other matters.
7

It is our position here today before you, however,

8 that that is not the question before the Court, that 201(b)

10 authority under the statute, and the Court need go no
11 further to decide this case -12

QUESTION;

Well, all right, but help me over that

13 interpretation, if you will.

Assume for a moment that it

14 was unlawful for New Hampshire to be regulating that at the
15 time that 201(b) was passed, and 201(b) was a grant of power
16 for a lawful exercise by New Hampshire.

Then how do you

17 interpret the statute, 201(b), to help you?

19 now.

NR. SMITH:

I would interpret it the way I have

That is, that if I assume, as you have asked me to,

20 that this section was required as a grant of authority by
21 Congress in order to avoid what would otherwise have
22 affected the commerce clause, then relying upon an
23 interpretation of lawful authority that referred directly to
24 the Constitution would not make any sense.

It is our view

25 that the use of the word "lawful" referred to the New

All that is done by the order in this case is a

22 concerned with regulation or prohibition of the volume of
23 hydroelectric energy which could be exported across state
24 lines.

In constitutional terms, what is the

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

MR. SMITH*

In constitutional terms, I am not sure

4 that there is any difference.
5

QUESTION*

Well, if there is no difference,

6 doesn't Attleboro establish they could not regulate rates
7 an! ergo they could not regulate volume either?
8

MR. SMITH;

The reason. Your Honor, that Attleboro

9 is not dispositive is that Congress in fact has exercised
10 its authority under the commerce clause and has adopted the
11 New Hampshire statute, and has permitted New Hampshire to
12 regulate .
13

QUESTION;

14 also revitalized what Attleboro put an end to?

I mean, I

15 don't understand why lawful -- do you get the thrust of my
16 concern?
17

MR. SMITH;

Yes.

I think that Attleboro was

18 decided when Congress had not acted.

And Attleboro decided

19 that the states were without authority to regulate wholesale
20 interstate shipments of hydroelectric energy as they were
21 with respect to gas.
22

QUESTION;

My question, in effect, is, did

23 Attleboro remain good law after the enactment of 201(b)?
24

MR. SMITH*

That's right.

That's right, because

25 Congress decided, having been called upon by the

1 particular statutes which we can look to as the authority,
2 that is, that lawful authority meant something less than
3 what you have suggested to me, Your Honor.

It meant that

4 authority or that kind of authority which is being exercised
5 now by four states under their state law, and I think that
6 it is clear that Congress was referring exactly to these
7 statutes.

Authority which is broader than that I don't

8 think fairly falls under that statute.
9

QUESTION i

I suppose you would agree, or would

10 you, that if your reading of that statute takes care of the
11 pre-emption aspect, it doesn't automatically follow that it
12 controls the commerce clause aspect of the case.
13

ME. SMITH:

I think it does both, Your Honor.

I

14 think that it clearly takes care of the pre-emption question
15 by its

very terms, and I think that it is clear

when

we look

16 to the

statute and the way in which it was placed in the Act

17 that it also was enacted by Congress presumed to be aware of
18 its authority under the commerce clause to adopt the New
19 Hampshire practice and permit it.
20

QUESTION:

Well, are you saying that the Congress

21 of the United States can interpret the commerce clause in a
22 way that is binding on everyone else?
23

MR. SMITH:

24 when it chooses to
25 states

No, I am saying that Congress may act

under the commerce clause to permit the

to regulate where they may not have been

able to

1 regulate without an authorizing Act of Congress.
2

QUESTION;

Certainly Article 1 would give you that

3 impression, wouldn’t it,

when it delegates to Congress the

4 right to regulate commerce among the several states?

5

MR. SMITH;

And I think that that power that

6 Congress has has always been referred to as plenary
7 authority to enter the field, and it is clear that Congress
8 may go further in permitting states to regulate than states
9 could have regulated if Congress had not acted.
10

QUESTION :

Well , do you mean by t ha t that if

11 Congress passed a statute that vested in th e Robert Ful ton
12 Steamship Company the rig ht to regulate tra ff ic on the
13 Hudson Ri ver in New York , that that wo uld b e binding on th
14 courts ?
15

MR. SMITHii

No, I th ink that Cong re ss may per mit

16 the states to regulsi te.
17

QUESTION;

Well , in Gibbons again st Ogden, th e

18 state had delegated that authority to Mr. F ul ton and hi s

19 colleagues, hadn’t they?
20

MR. SMITH;

Well, I think that Congress in that

21 case, Congress had not addressed the matter at all, as I
22 recall it.

And it was clear that the silence of the

23 commerce clause was sufficient to render unconstitutional
24 the action of the state in having provided the preference to
25 the private entrepreneur.

3

New Hampshire wants to effect this
the grid system, doesn’t it?

MR. SMITH:

That’s correct, and the 1978

4 amendments provide that for the first time the federal
5 authority may require interconnection and wheeling of
6 authority across utilities to others.

Before that, it was

7 voluntary, and it seems to me that the clear effect of that
8 is that if the federal energy regulatory commission wants to
9 exercise the authority it now has,

there is a specific

10 provision exempting that kind of authority, that is,
11 mandatory pooling, from the effect of 201(b),
12 wasn't so until

1978.

but that

Congress specifically exempted this

I would simply like to conclude, in sum, by saying

3 possible meaning, it must authorize what New Hampshire was

QUESTION:

Would you agree that the FERC could

step in at this stage and say that the New Hampshire Supreme

8 Court decision and PUC decision were superseded by a new

order of the FERC?
NR. SMITH:

I don't think in this particular case

there would be any occasion to do that, but I think with the

12 1978 amendments, that were New Hampshire to have exercised
13

its authority more broadly, and to have reguired that the

14

wires be snipped, as it said in the briefs, that with the

15

1978 amendments, for the first time the Federal Energy

16

Regulatory Commission could mandate interconnection and

17 wheeling, and that seems to me to be clear, but New
18

Hampshire has not exercised authority that broad in this

19 particular case.
20

It seems to me that the appellants can prevail in

21

only one of two ways.

They must either have met their

22

burden of proof that the Act of Congress which remained

23

unchallenged for 45 years is unconstitutional, which they

24

have not done, or they can go across the street to Congress

25

and ask Congress to amend the statute.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL HUNTINGTON, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT IN NO. 80-1208

6

MR. HUNTINGTON*

Very well.

The Attorney General stated that

7 it is not significant whether the Section 201(b) savings
8 clause is a

grant or a savings clause.

We differ there.

We

9 say that is very significant, and that is the square holding
10 of

BT Investment Managers just last term.

11 with a

clause such as this,

12 questions.

When presented

the Court must ask two

First, does the clause interdict pre-emption?

13 We say clearly it does to some extent, and we have discussed
14 in our brief exactly to what extent it does interdict Part 2
15 pre-emption.
16

The second question is, does the clause go beyond

17 interdicting pre-emption and affirmatively give to the
18 states an authority to regulate commerce that the states did
19 not previously have.
20 found

In BT Investment Managers, the Court

that savings clause did not do that.

21 this savings

We submit that

clause, which reads virtually identically to

22 the Bank Holding Company Act savings clause in

BT Investment

23 Managers, also does not give the state authority.
24

In fact. New Hampshire concedes in their brief at

25 Page 15 that the language of 201(b) is not that usually used

41

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 by a legislature when authorizing an act.

That, we submit,

2 is an understatement.
3

QUESTION;

When was the Bank Holding Company Act

4 enacted?
5

MB. HUNTINGTON;

I am afraid I don't know.

6

Basically what happened here is. Congress finessed

7 the issue as to whether the New Hampshire authority referred
8 to by Congressman Rodgers was or was not -- Congress
9 finessed it by saying,

whatever authority you have is saved

10 from Part 2 pre-emption, but left to the courts to determine
11 what is saved, and

12 for the first time.
13 has imposed

that is precisely what this case presents
This is the first time New Hampshire

a restriction.

In fact, the first time any

14 state has imposed a restriction --

Well, then, you concede that Congress

intend to pre-empt New Hampshire's authority by

18

MR. HUNTINGTON;

19 question

in volume versus rate regulation which Mr. Justice

20 Stevens raised.
21 now

I think that comes to the

I was interested to hear Mr. Smith contend

that all New Hampshire did here was to regulate volume

22 and not rates.

New Hampshire did not in any way attempt to

23 restrict physically the amount of energy flowing out of
24 state from these units.

What did New Hampshire do?

They

25 attempted to require New England Power Company to sell this

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 power within New Hampshire, an economic shift through
2 adjustments in wholesale contracts and tariffs.

That is

3 wholesale ratemaking, and that is exclusively within the
4 jurisdiction of FERC.
5

There is one further case which we discuss in our

6 brief which I think is pertinent here, and that is the
7 California case.
8

QUESTION;

You essentially then agree with the

9 position of the United States, or the FERC, with respect to
10 pre-emption ?
MR. HUNTINGTON;

11

Yes, we do.

And we argue

12 pre-emption on both Part 1 and Part 2 in our brief, and rely
13 on our discussion there.

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. HUNTINGTON;

16

Yes.

Section 20 of Part 1.

The California case involved

Section 20 of Part 1

recognized or at

17 least referred to state authority over wholesale sales from
18 hydroelectric plants that are licensed.
19

The Court had

before it, does the state have any lawful authority after

20 Attleboro over sales from hydroelectric licensed units, and
21 the court held, no,

it didn't.

Congress was simply wrong

22 when they assumed in enacting Section 20 that the states had
23 some authority.
24 here.

We think we have a parallel situation

Whatever Congressman Rodgers may have assumed, in

25 fact, New Hampshire does not have any type of

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 authority under the commerce clause.

That is what lawful

2 authority is, and that -3

QUESTION;

But doesn't that bear on pre-emption,

4 even if Congress is wrong as to its perception of the
5 constitutional law, if it enacts a statute under that
6 misapprehension?

The misapprehension may be a valid tool

7 for construing the statute?
8

MR. HUNTINGTON;

It is certainly a valid tool as

9 far as pre-emption is concerned, but Congress did not pass
10 judgment on the lawfulness of the New Hampshire authority,
11 and that is why they said lawful authority now exercised,

12 leaving it for further determination what that lawful
13 authority is.

14

QUESTION;

Well,

I take it the position of the

15 United States or the FERC and you on pre-emption is that
16 however you construe 201(b), that Ne w Hampshire has gone way
17 beyond whatever Cong ress may have approved in that.

It

18 never approved this approach to keeping the power within New
19 Hampshire.

20

MR. HUNTINGTON;

Precisely.
