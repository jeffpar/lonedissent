ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. ZARNOCH, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

We will hear arguments

MR. ZARNOCH:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this is the second time this case has

10

been here, the second time this Court has been called

11

upon to examine the constitutionality of the University

12

of Maryland’s policy of denying in-state benefits to

13

non-immigrant aliens.

14

The last time this case was here, it was

15

complicated by an unresolved issue of state law and of

16

concerns over the University's basis for treating

17

non-immigrant aliens differently, issues that have

18

caused this case to be certified, the question to be

19

certified to the court of appeals of Maryland, and

20

ultimately the case to be remanded back down to the

21

district court.

22

These questions are now behind us.

This time

23

around, however, the case raises additional and perhaps

24

more significant constitutional questions evidenced, I

25

think, by the fact that for the first time in this

Court's history, all 50 states are participating here as

2

amici and unified behind a single position, namely,

3

urging the reversal of the Fourth Circuit’s decision and

4

overruling of Viandis versus Kline.

5

Of the four constitutional questions raised in

6

this case, the foremost issue, we think, is the question

7

of whether the University's policy denies equal

8

protection to non-immigrant aliens.

9

prevail on this ground, many of the other issues in the

We think that if we

case could quickly fall by the wayside.
Now, the equal protection issue here, we

12

think, calls into play the very rationale for labeling

13

certain alien classifications suspect and for according

14

them strict scrutiny, a rationale we say that focuses in

15

on the burdens permanent resident aliens share with

16

citizens, and which non-immigrant aliens as a class

17

conspicuously lack.

18

saddled with disabilities, we suggest that non-immigrant

19

aliens, on the other hand, are blessed with privilege.

20

At the outset, it is important to understand

Although resident aliens may be

21

what is at stake here, how many persons are affected by

22

the University's policy, and the nature of the

23

disadvantaged class.

24

here is the tuition differential.

Maryland does not deny state scholarships to

non-immigrant aliens as a class, assuming they can show

financial need.

The state of

It is also important to note how many people

11

are affected by the University’s policy.

12

the record in this case, during the years 1978 and 1979,

13

there were anywhere from 1,000 to 1,200 permanent

14

resident aliens attending the University of Maryland.

QUESTIONS

MR. ZARN0CH:

According to

Annually?
Annually.

And during that

17

period, approximately 95 percent of those permanent

18

resident aliens qualified for the in-state — were

19

classified in-state and received the benefit.

20

21

as few as 497, I believe, in 1978.

visitors, foreign students, and employees of

non-immigrant aliens, and in fact both the lower court

policy focuses in to an extent on tax contributions of

That's true, Your Honor.

And all property taxes?

10

MR. ZARNOCH*

11

QUESTION*

12

MR. ZARNOCH*

That's true. Your Honor.

And sales taxes?
There is absolutely no —

13

federal law draws no distinction between resident aliens

14

and citizens.

15

There is no difference.

QUESTION*

Is there any category that has

16

access, for example, to tax-free stores equivalent to

17

our post exchanges in other countries?

18
19

MR. ZARNOCH*

I'm not sure, Your Honor.

MR. ZARNOCH*

No.
In terms of the other criteria

24

this Court has looked at in terms of strict scrutiny, it

25

is also emphasized that resident aliens serve in the

2

non-immigrant aliens are excluded from — were excluded

3

when we had a draft, and presently are not subject to

4

draft registration, so they are not obliged to serve in

5

the military.

6

I think you ought to note here that the

The Court has also noted on occasions that

7

resident aliens are required to obey all of our laws.

8

Well, here, certain categories of non-immigrants are not

9

completely obliged to obey all our laws.

For example,

10

diplomats are one class that because of either

11

diplomatic immunity or statutory immunity are not fully

12

liable for violation of certain laws, and the same is

13

true of employees of international organizations, who by

14

statute have a certain immunity that relieves them from

15

the obligations of complying with all the country's laws.

17

HR. ZARNOCH;

That is by federal statute.

I take it you are going to address

the pre-emption argument here, too.

20

HR. ZARNOCH;

21

I certainly will. Your Honor.

Of course, many of the things you

MR. ZARNOCH;

Your Honor, this case was

argued, it was argued to the district court on the

grounds that, in 1976, that is, on the grounds that G-4

aliens could not acquire a domicile —

that they couldn't acquire domicile.

QUESTION;

4

MR, ZARNOCH;

Well, then, so you do say —
I say you have to address the

5

issue.

You just don’t have to overrule Viandis versus

6

Kline to do it.

7

you know, you have sustained the policy.

I think if you find a rational basis,

QUESTION;

All right.

9

MR. ZARNOCH;

We have also argued a number of

10

grounds for getting around Viandis versus Kline, but we

11

do ask the Court", and we — as all 50 states do, to

12

overrule Viandis versus Kline, because we do think the

13

case is really a dead letter in the law.
To turn to the supremacy clause for a moment,

15

there are really two separate supremacy clause

arugments.

the lower court held the policy invalid on that ground

given.

22

theory prevails, we should be -- if the Court finds it

23

okay under equal protection, it should find the policy

okay under the supremacy clause, under that aspect of

25

the supremacy clause.

So, as a practical matter, if we — if that

Now, the lower court rejected this purported

class of rationales as too attenuated to amount to a

supremacy clause violation, and we suggest that at least

12

in this respect the lower court was right, that what the

a group of non-immigrant aliens who, for a particular

reason, and it is not just, you know, this particular

QUESTION;

Kay I ask one other question?

2

SR. ZARNOCH:

3

QUESTION:

Sure.

To what extent do you pursue the

4

argument that you can treat these people differently?

5

Could you deny them, say, garbage collection services,

6

or police protection, without charging them a special

7

fee for it, say?
MR. ZARNOCH:

8

Your Honor, I think in terms of

9

the cost equalization rationale, it is particularly

10

appropriate when you are talking about a university

11

education that is funded by primarily tax, income tax

12

remedies .

13

QUESTION;

So are you other state services.

14

MR. ZARNOCH;

But — well, most of them are —

15

for example, police protection is funded by local

16

property tax.

17

There really is no disability, as I understand it, from

18

any of the -- any non-immigrants from contributing their

19

full share of property taxes.

20

is that the rationale, our rational basis that we are

21

asserting here may not hold water if you are trying to

22

justify that kind of restriction.

respect to an income tax contribution rationale, but,

For example, if you stay in the state for a

period of time, for example, an alien with a tax

exemption, or a non-immigrant alien with a tax

exemption, you are likely to stay here for a number of

years, you know, just beyond the four years that a

student might be in college.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES R. BIEKE, ESQ.,

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

4

MR. BIEKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

5

please the Court, there can be no question that the

6

University’s policy establishes a classification based

7

on alienage, for on its face it allows citizens and

8

immigrant aliens who are domiciled in Maryland to obtain

9

in-state status upon a showing of their domicile, but it

10

totally excludes all non-immigrant aliens from doing so

11

even if they are likewise domiciled in Maryland, and it

12

is equally clear that this policy, this classification

13

treats unequally only the non-immigrants who can be and

14

are domiciled in Maryland.

15

Contrary to what the Assistant Attorney

16

General said, this is not at all all non-immigrants.

17

This Court’s opinion in the Elkins case held

18

specifically that most non-immigrants, and it listed a

19

number of the visa categories, were precluded by the

20

terms of their visas under federal law from establishing

21

domicile in this country.

22

Obviously, these people are not discriminated

23

against by the University's policy, because even if they

24

were treated like citizens and immigrants, they would

25

fail to qualify.

Under this Court’s decisions in the cases of

Bica, it is established that it is up to the federal

government to decide the terms and conditions upon which

aliens will be admitted to this country and will reside

in this country, and once it has done so, the states may

not impose additional discriminatory burdens on them —

15

excuse me -- not contemplated by Congress, and they

16

especially may not do so on account of their immigration

17

status assigned by Congress.

18

Here, Congress has assigned the various

19

classes of immigrants and non-immigrants, and has

20

decided on the restrictions applicable to them, and as

21

this Court held in Elkins, Congress has deliberately

22

decided that the G-4 visa holders and a few other

That would be okay, if they

treated citizens and immigrants the same as

non-immigrants.

No, citizens, $50, your category,

MR. BIEKE:

Citizens of the United States

Non-immigrants resident of Virginia, even if domiciled

there, pay $100.

Now, there is a case —
Rhat if Maryland had a rule that

people who don *t pay the income tax shall pay a slightly

higher property tax?

7

MB. BIEKEs

I think that would be penalizing

8

them on account of something granted by the federal

9

government.

Now, there is a good case not cited in our

10

brief on this point, a case called Perez against

11

Campbell.

12

That case involved the Federal Bankruptcy Act, which

13

allowed people to obtain full discharges in bankruptcy,

14

and the Court there held that it was a violation of the

15

supremacy clause for the state to have a statute which

16

required suspension of their driver's licenses for

17

non-payment of judgments arising from auto accidents,

18

even when there had been a discharge in bankruptcy, and

19

the reason was that that penalized them on account of

20

something granted by federal law.

It is in 402 of the United States Reports.

QUESTION:

You mean, penalized them as

MR. BIEKE:

Yes, indeed, penalized them as

compared to other people.
QUESTION:

So you don't — if Maryland said,

well, we will just start taxing these people on their

2

foreign source income?
MR. BIEKE:

3

That wouldn’t be -- that wouldn’t

be penalizing them if that was true of other people as

well.
QUESTION:

6

Well, I know, but wouldn't — say

7

they just, people who are not, who are exempt from

federal income tax, we are going to start charging,

taxing their foreign source income.
MR. BIEKE:

10

I think that it would be — if

11

they were being treated differently than citizens and

12

immigrants, and on account of the fact that they had a

13

federal tax exemption, then that would not be something

14

that would be consistent with the federal tax

exemption.

But if they taxed the foreign

MR. BIEKE:

Of course, they do tax

They do in most situations.
Yes.

Yes.

But if they taxed the

21

foreign source income of all aliens, you wouldn’t have

22

much of a beef.

23

MR. BIEKE:

Well, they might have a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT A. ZARNOCH, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL
MR. ZARNOCH:

very brief.

First —

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

17
18

Your Honor, I will just be very,

You have four minutes

remaining.

19

MR. ZARNOCH:

Four minutes, Your Honor?

20

Your Honor, in terms of the assertion that

21

most spouses of G-4 aliens pay some tax, the record —

22

the only record references to the actual payment of tax

23

would show that two out of the three parents of the

24

named plaintiffs do not have spouses earning income

25

tax.

The record would rebut that contention.

Your Honor, in terms of the class affected

2

the question here that we are only dealing with a small

3

number of non-immigrant aliens, first, diplomats, A visa

4

holders, aren’t any different than G visa holders.

5

There are 72 of them at the University of Maryland

during the period in question.

So you would add another

Moreover, the question of whether any of the

11

categories of non-immigrant aliens can be domiciled in

12

Maryland is a question for the Maryland courts to

13

decide, as this Court indicated itself in Elkins versus

14

Moreno the first time this case was here.

15

across the country differ widely on visa categories,

16

whether they are able to acquire domicile in a

17

jurisdiction for a particular purpose.

18

absolutely no consistency, no guarantee that the court

19

of appeals wouldn’t find every category of non-immigrant

20

capable of being domiciled in the state of Maryland.

There is
