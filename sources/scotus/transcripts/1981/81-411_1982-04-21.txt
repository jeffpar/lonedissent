We will hear arguments

MR. KAUFMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
This case directly brings before the Court

10

today the provisions of the Urban Mass Transportation

11

Act of 1964 for the first time.

12

the Court today is whether by enacting UHTA, and

13

particularly Section 13(c)

14

required federal courts to federalize municipal transit

15

labor relations over federal grant recipients by

16

creating a federal common law to resolve public sector

17

transit labor disputes and thereby preempt state law.

This controversy that reaches the Court today

is between two private parties, Jackson and the union.

There is no federal interest in the outcome of this

QUESTION’:

Well, that's true in a lot of

18

cases, Mr. Kaufman, where nonetheless a federal right of

19

action has been implied, isn't it?

20

and cases like that?
ME. KAUFMAN:

21

J. I. Case v. Borak

Well, yes, sir, but the J. I. v.

22

Borak has been somewhat cut back by your more recent

23

decisions.

QUESTION;

But even in some of our — those

cases where a private right of action has been implied,

SR. KAUFKAN;

But there was a direct command

in the statutes involved in those cases which is not

5

true here, as I will point out in a moment.
I might point out, sirs, that UKTA was on the

6
7

books for some 12 years before the union sought to

8

utilize the federal courts to bring actions such as this

9

nature.

This was one of the first attempts.

If the

10

decision of the Sixth Circuit is affirmed, municipal

11

transit labor relations will be decided in two courts,

12

in state courts as well as federal courts.

Section

Mr. Kaufman, to what extent is the

8

continuance of state law a binding obligation?

9

after the grant is made the state changes its law, wipes

10
11

Suppose

out collective bargaining.
MR. KAUFMAN;

If that were to happen, Your

12

Honor, there is adequate provision in UMTA itself, in

13

Section 1602(f) and (g) of the law, the Secretary is

14

instructed to bar further grants to those communities

15

which do not comply with their grant contracts.

16

is a cutting off of funding mechanism built right into

17

the act itself.

18

2UESTION:

19

MR. KAUFMAN;

Is that the end of it?
No, sir.

There is a provision

20

that the Secretary can enforce agreements.

21

on his agreement.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION;

There

He could sue

So the Secretary could go into

federal court.
MR. KAUFMAN;

Yes, sir.

But this is where we

have a private party attempting to go in.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

What would be the law governing if

2

the Secretary went in?

3

MR. KAUFMAN:

4

QUESTION*

The law would be govern --

There might be jurisdiction, but

5

what would be the governing law?

6

MR. KAUFMAN:

The governing law would be the

7

law of contracts, Your Honor, which essentially is state

8

law.

9

There is no federal common law of contracts.
QUESTION:

Well, there's a lot of contracts

10

that federal law requires or specifies that are governed

11

by federal law.

12

MR. KAUFMAN:

Some are governed by -- but this

13

contract, I think, would be governed by state law, and

14

let me explain why I say that.

15
16
17

QUESTION;

What about an ordinary collective

bargaining contract subject to the labor laws?
MR. KAUFMAN:

Those are expressly governed

18

because Congress created federal court jurisdiction and

19

mandated federal law apply.

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION;

Well, it didn't mandate it.

We

said it did, but that isn’t what the statute said.
MR. KAUFMAN:

Well then, this Court said it

did. Your Honor, and I will accept that correction.
QUESTION:

So it might as well have said it,

might as well have said it.

2

QUESTION*

May I ask. a question about Section

13(c) agreement?

3

MR. KAUFMAN;

4

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Right on this point.

I think it is

5

quoted in -- at 17a of the Joint Appendix.

There’s a

6

sentence in the agreement that says any public body or

7

agency shall comply with the requirements of 10(c) in

8

such manner as is necessary not to reduce or impair any

9

rights, privileges and benefits which such employees of

10

such transit sytem would have received or be entitled to

11

had the system continued under its former private

12

management.

13

Now, had it continued under the former

14

management, the rights would have been federal rights,

15

wouldn't they?

16

MR. KAUFMAN:

Your Honor, if it had -- in this

17

particular case that is true, but that wasn't the

18

situation under which UMTA was —

19

20
21

QUESTION;

But this is the agreement we are

talking about.
MR. KAUFMAN;

That's true, and there's also

22

provisions I believe you will find in that agreement, if

23

it is unenforceable, that you go back to the Secretary

24

of Labor for new types of arrangements.

25

QUESTION:

response to Justice Blackmun's question, if this — they

would have had federal rights before and those are

no remedy in cutting off further funding, why couldn't

the state, under your view, why couldn't the state

simply pass a statute that says, well, municipal bodies

don't have to abide by collective bargaining agreements

1

Well, what if the state passed a

2

new statute on what it takes to ratify a contract or

3

something of that kind?

your view.

5

MR. KAUFMAN;

Then that would control under

Your Honor, I know of no state

6

action anywheres that that has ever happened, and why I

7

believe it would not happen, that although Jackson is a

8

small community in Tennessee, the other communities in

9

Tennessee that are not so small such as Memphis and

10

Nashville and Knoxville and Chattanooga are not going to

11

have their federal funding cut off because Jackson

12

decided it didn't want to collectively bargain anymore.

13

As a practical matter what happens is that

14

state laws have been adjusted to accommodate the

15

situation under Section 13(c), not the reverse, the

16

cutoff situation.

17

The federal --

18

QUESTION!

As a practical matter, perhaps it

19

wouldn’t happen, but you say as a matter, conceptually,

20

there's really no federal objection to it if the state

21

should decide to do so.

22

SR. KAUFMAN;

Your Honor, if you look at the

23

whole UKTA act, the one thing that comes out clear in

24

the legislative history was that once a grant was made,

25

there should be as little federal interference as

possible
There were two concepts before the Congress at

3

that time, to have loan guarantees on one hand which

4

would require continuous federal monitoring, and on the

5

other hand to have a situation where all the documents

6

are forwarded and judgement is made whether this was a

7

good or bad project to be funded.

8

they would go on and look at the next project.

9

wasn't to be that type of — and it was intentionally

10

not to be that continuous type of monitoring as is in

11

certain other programs that have proved disastrous to

12

the government.

5

Once it was funded,
There

Your Honor, we can always speculate it could
have happened.
QUESTION;

Well, I'm not -- that's right, and

6

I'm troubled, frankly, the thing that troubles me is the

7

language in the agreement itself here, which seems to

8

contemplate no difference in the substantive rights of

9

the parties before and after, and I think you suggest

20

there's a rather significant difference.

21

MR. KAUFMANs

Yes, sir.

22

And I think you also have to look at what the

23

legislative history was because time and again both the

24

sponsor of the bill, the Kennedy administration, the

25

floor leader of the bill. Senator Williams, the Chairman

of the Committee that handled the till, Senator

2

Sparkman, and the Floor proponent of the bill. Senator

3

Morse, said time and time again that this was not

intended to supersede state law, that it was not

5

intended to override state law or preempt state law in

6

any way.

7

their laws, modify their laws to have collective

8

bargaining, and if they didn't, they wouldn't get the

9

funding.

10

It was truly to encourage states to adjust

I think probably the best example of how the

11

law was intended to work is in the City of Macon case

12

which is cited in our brief.

QUESTION:

But it's the state law after the

MR. KAUFMAN:

No, sir, before the grant is

modified in order to make it compatible with the

18

continuation of collective bargaining and therefore to

19

get the money.

20

21
22

QUESTION:

But no obligation to make it

continue to be compatible.
MR. KAUFMAN;

Your Honor, I don't know how you

23

make people comply with the law that sign documents that

24

they are going to comply with the law,

25

We are dealing with situations that have never happened,

to the best of my knowledge, where a state has

2

absolutely repealed its law.
Now, we do have situations where states have

modified their laws, and there's a matter that's pending

5

before you on cert right now at MB1A where they modified

6

their laws regarding interest arbitration, but it didn't

7

end collective bargaining.
Now, as I said, UMTA is, must be viewed as a

21

It is clear from the language of the statute

itself that UMTA was to meet the requirements of local

in order to facilitate desirable urban renewal.

Interestingly, as you read the legislative

history, the reason that 13(c)

a happening that you suggest. Justice Stevens, in Dade

11

It was in that type of factual background that the

12

unions came to the Kennedy administration and said we

13

Ion't want federal funds to be used to defeat the

14

workers* rights as happened in Dade County.

15

Congress and the administration had three

16

choices in that light.

The first was to have full

17

federal involvement akin to the railroad and airline

18

industries, under the Railway Labor Act, in other words,

19

federalized local transit labor relations.

20

option was to keep hands off and do nothing.

21

third option, the one that was eventually adopted, was

22

the carrot and stick approach, to make federal funding

23

attractive so as to have the states that had hostile

24

collective bargaining laws to either modify those laws

or work out some innovative arrangement in order to be

2

I want to tell you why that is particularly

3

important in the light of what was happening in 1963.

4

In 1963 the major transit systems had already gone from

5

the private to the public sector.

6

Chicago, L.A., Boston, Seattle, Oakland, California,

7

Cleveland, just to name a few, had already made the

9

procedures.

New York City,

They were already governed by state law

10

Now, if that was the case, we would have two

11

classes of systems, those who were later going to fall

12

into the same trend and who were still governed by

3

federal law at that time, and those that had already

4

made the transition, the major systems that needed the

5

money most of all.

6

I don't think Congress ever intended to have

7

two classes.

They intended to have a situation to make

8

That language is right in the statute.

look at Section 13(c)(2) you see that it says the

continuation of collective bargaining rights.

between creating rights and preserving the rights as

they existed before.

Why not?

Because when these employees

MRS. HIRSHMAN;

No.

Your Honor, the Congress

in this case.

not divest the employees of their labor rights, and they

are enumerated in the statute.

that’s the way you construe the act.
MRS. HIRSHMAN;

It was preserved to them

through the vehicle of Section 13(c).

So in order to get the

21

Is that what you’re saying?

the years of history under the National Labor Relations

QUESTION*

5

Hell, let me ask, let me ask you

6

this.

Suppose there was a collective bargaining

agreement in effect and the city says, well, sure, we'll

continue that collective bargaining agreement for as

9

long as it lasts.

Fell, the contract expires, and so

10

there’s no more contract rights right then, and then you

Now, what right is there to do

I mean, what — is the basis for it the National

The basis for it is Section

Well, it just continued rights that

they had, and so what right was it?
MRS. HIRSHMAN:

They would have rights whose

22

substance and understanding is derived from the years of

23

experience under the National Labor Relations Act but

24

whose actual legal, enforceable source is Section 13(c)

25

of the Urban Mass Transportation Act, and that came up

in Congress.

I mean, that came up in the iebates in

2

Congress, and I think it was Senator Korse who said they

3

would retain their rights, not by virtue of the National

which 13(c)

will oblige them to make.

say yes.
MRS. HIRSHMAN:

you take your employees out of the private sector and

18

transfer them into the public sector whereby they are

19

not covered by the strict terms of the National Labor

MRS. HIRSHMAN:

QUESTION:

I’m sorry.

Supposing the contract expires and

there's bargaining for a new contract, and the

under the' National Labor.
MRS. HIRSHMAN:

9

QUESTIONS

10

11
12

You don’t have a remedy

No.

What remedy, if any, would you

have ?
MRS. HIRSHMAN:

The 13(c) agreements commit

13

the recipients of federal funds, as Congress intended

14

them to be committed, to bargain collectively with us.

15

QUESTION;

Yes.

16

MRS. HIRSHMAN:

And I think that we would be

17

seeking to enforce the 13(c) agreement which has a

18

provision for arbitration of disputes over its terms.

19

So that if, for example, the transit authority said no,

20

it’s not an unfair labor practice, or we were bargaining

21

in good faith, whatever, then we would have, as the

22

13(c) agreements provide, a dispute over whether they

23

were violating the terms of the 13(c) agreement, and we

24

would arbitrate over that.

25

But that's not what they did here.

They took

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

a collective bargaining agreement that they had signed

2

the same way that they had signed ordinary collective

3

bargaining agreements for ten years, and wrote a letter

4

to the union informing us that the collective bargaining

5

agreement was personal to the personnel director whom

6

they had discharged.
Now, if there's one thing that collective

7
8

bargaining rights means, it means that when you sign a

9

collective bargaining agreement, it is binding on the

10

parties and enforceable by them.

That was certainly

11

Congress' understanding in 1964.

That is certainly the

12

only reasonable understanding of the language of the

13

act.

14

collective bargaining rights when he amended the

15

preparatory language of encouragement to make collective

16

bargaining rights mandatory.

17

only wanted to nudge the recipients of federal grants

18

with language of encouragement, then, he said, under the

19

committee's indefinite language, collective bargaining

20

agreements could be ignored or set aside by systems of

21

public ownership.

And that is what the sponsor of the act said about

encouraging them, was that the scenario that you have

place.

14

QUESTION;

What is at issue here, the

15

enforceability of the collective bargaining contract

16

that was entered into pursuant to 13(c)?

17

MRS. HIRSHMAN;

We have both issues, Ycur

18

Honor, whether the collective bargaining rights

19

preserved to the employees through the vehicle of 13(c)

20

includes the common understanding that collective

bargaining agreements are enforceable by the parties to

them in federal court.

Well, th e second option that

Congress had in front of it when i t was considering

of Section 13(c) to state law, and they rejected that

option five times.

Senator Tower proposed it twice on the Senate floor.

12

Well, that do esn't necessarily —

13

it doesn't necessarily follow from that that a

collective bargaining agreement en tered into pursuant to

20

lour Honor, what happens, the situation that

21

Congress was facing was the Dade County scenario where

22

the state law not only prohibited collective bargaining,

but also did not provide the employees with an action to

enforce their collective bargaining agreement, so that

was trying to solve.

simply did not provide the employees with an action to

9

The fact that the law of a particular state at

10

the moment that the grant issues is or is not hostile to

Should this Court require an example of a

MRS. HIRSHMANs

If the particular 13(c)

3

MRS. HIRSHKAN:

Right.

And what Congress

4

sought to do was to preserve for the employees here the

other structure of relationships because they saw what

happened when the transit employees in Dade County were

transferred to that system, and they knew that the

MRS. HIRSHMAN:

15

No.

All that 13(c) would do

16

in that case is preserve whatever rights the employees

we would still have rights under the statute directly.

19

There's been some discussion in the briefings and the

20

Eleventh Circuit adverted to the point that somehow our

21

rights only derived from the 13(c) agreement and not

22

from the statute itself, and should this Court determine

23

to consider only the statute, you would not have to

24

imply a private right of action for us there because the

2

the violation of that commitment violates the federal

3

staute mandating the commitment to be made.

This Court has never held to my knowledge that

5

the mere making of the commitment is sufficient to

satisfy the federal statutory mandate, The ink still

contained in the commitment are, if you're just

Maine v. Thiboutot the state executed a plan, just like

11

the federal statute required, containing the particular

12

payment of welfare provisions that the statute required,

13

and thereafter when the beneficiaries of that

14

arrangement came to enforce it, this Court held that

15

1983 created a claim for them.

In sum, the United States Court of Appeals for
