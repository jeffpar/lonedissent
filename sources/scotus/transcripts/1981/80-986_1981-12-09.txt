ORAL ARGUMENT OF SUSAN K. KRELL, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER NEW HAVEN BOARD OF EDUCATION

8

MS. KRELL:

Thank you.

9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court,

10 this case involves the validity of regulations promulgated
11

by the then Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,

12

now the Department of Education, pursuant to Sections 901

13 and

902 of the Education Amendments of 1972.
It is the Petitioners' position that Section 901

14

15 was drafted

with an unmistakable focus on the beneficiaries

16 of federal financial assistance and
17 prohibition
18 federal

not as a general

on discriminatory conduct by recipients of such

financial assistance, and thus the regulations in

19 question are invalid.
20
21

I will briefly present the facts in the North
Haven case, and counsel for Trumbull will address the facts

22 in that case.
23

The legal issues are the same.

The North Haven case arose when a former teacher

24 who had quit her job applied for an open position and a
25 different female applicant was hired.

The rejected

3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 applicant filed charges of sex discrimination in employment
2 with the EEOC and with HEW.

She also filed a federal court

3 suit under Title 7 of the 1964 Civil Eights Act, under 43 US
4 Code 1983, and under Title 9.
5

When HEW attempted to investigate her charge, the

6 Board of Education pointed out that it believed HEW did not
7 have jurisdiction over general employment practices, and
8 that several district courts had so found.

HEW, however,

9 persisted, thus necessitating the North Haven Board filing a
10 suit in district court in Connecticut.

Judge Ellen B. Burns

11 granted North Haven's motion for summary judgment, and held

12 the regulations in question void, invalid, and of no effect
13 whatsoever, and granted an injunction prohibiting further
14 investigation by HEW.
15

The Trumbull litigation followed a similar path,

16 and the Department of Justice appealed both cases to the
17 Second Circuit Court of Appeals, where they were
18 consolidated.

The cases were held in abeyance pending a

19 decision by this Court on three petitions for writs of

20 certiorari filed by Justice Department from three court of
21 appeals decisions that, similar to Judge Ellen Burns'
22 decision, had held the regulations invalid.
23

When those petitions were denied, the cases were

24 reactivated and heard by the Second Circuit.

At that time

25 there were 15 court decisions in various district courts and

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 courts of appeals, all holding these regulations invalid.
2 The Second Circuit, however, reversed the decision of the
3 district court and upheld the validity of those
4 regulations.
5

It is our position that an analysis of the

6 legislative scheme of Title 9 in its entirety, of the
7 statutory language of Sections 901 and 902, and the
8 legislative history all establish that employees in general
9 are not among the class protected by Section 901.

The

10 Department of Education has recently indicated its agreement
11 with that position.

12

The genesis of what became Title 9 were hearings,

13 extensive hearings held before the House of Representatives
14 in

1970, and at that time two problems were brought to its

15 attention.

One was sex discrimination in employment against

16 women employed in educational institutions, and at that time
17 Title 7 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act explicitly excluded
18 women -- excluded educational institutions from its
19 parameters.

The Equal Pay Act at that time exluded people

20 in positions of executive, professional, and academic.

That

21 would also work to the detriment of women faculty members of
22 educational institutions.
23

So, thus there was one very special problem of

24 women employees of educational institutions who were victims
25 of sex discrimination and who were not protected by Title 7

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

2

of the Equal Pay Act.
Another problem that was brought to Congress's

3

attention was the problem of student beneficiaries who were

4

also or might also be victims of sex discrimination and who

5

were not protected by Section 601 of the 1964 Civil Rights

6

Act, a section that protected beneficiaries of federal

7

financial assistance from race, color, or national origin

8

discrimination, but did not prohibit sex discrimination.

9

Growing out of these hearings was the bill that

10

became Title 9, which very explicitly addressed the problem

11

of women employees by amending Title 7 to remove that

12

exemption for employees of educational institutions, and by

13

amending the Equal Pay Act to remove the exemption for

14

academic, professional, and executive positions.

15

So, employees of educational institutions now have

16

federal forums, federal agencies that could investigate

17

their claims and could go into federal court pursuant to

18

those statutes.

19

addressed in what became Section 901 of Title 9.

20

section that was enacted prohibited discrimination on the

21

basis of sex in educational programs or activities.

22

The problems of student beneficiaries were
The

That Section 901 language was chosen over other

23

proposals that had been suggested to Congress.

One proposal

24

by the Department of Justice had suggested that instead of

25

amending Title 7 in the Equal Pay Act to protect employees
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 of educational institutions, HEW should be given that
2 jurisdiction, and it proposed what would have been
3 comparable to Section 901(a), a general prohibition against
4 discrimination of beneficiaries, and explicitly would have
5 given jurisdiction over employment to HEW.

That proposal,

6 however, was not adopted.
7

Similarly, Senator McGovern had proposed a bill

8 that would have first banned general discrimination against
9 beneficiaries in educational programs, and again would have
10 explicitly covered employment.

Those proposals were not

11 adopted.
12

What was adopted was the scheme to protect

13 employees under Title 7 in the Equal Pay Act, and to protect
14 student beneficiaries under Section 901.
15

The statute then is clearly addressed to those

16 beneficiaries.

The exceptions to Section 901 are also all

17 addressed to the student relationship.

They address

18 admissions to educational institutions, certain programs or
19 activities that would affect students, or exempt
20 institutions in their entirety.

Nothing related to

21 employment is under Section 901.
22

When Congress does address employment, it has put

23 certain exceptions into the statute.

Title 7, for example,

24 makes an exception for bona fide occupational qualification,

25 or for a national security exemption.

Those exceptions were

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 missing from the Section 901 exceptions, further indication
2 that employment was not covered in that general prohibition
3 to protect students.
4

The HEW regulations in question, however, go much

5 further than the statutory language.
6

QUESTION;

Ms. Krell, how do you deal with the

7 fact that Title 9 was patterned after Title 6, and Title 6
8 had an express provision excluding employment practices from
9 its coverage, and a similar section proposed in Title 9 was
10 removed?
11

MS. KRELL;

12 employment.

Title 9 in its entirety did address

Sections 906 and 908 of Title 9 were the

13 sections that amended Title 7 and amended the Equal Pay
14 Act.

To have a Section 904 in it prohibiting agency action

15 if there was employment discrimination would have been
16 inconsistent.
17

So therefore it was eliminated in Congress.

But I think it is also important to remember that

18 Section 604 is not an exclusion from coverage under Section
19 601.

It was instead a clarification of what Senator

20 Humphrey had said had always been intended by the language
21 of Section 601 on which Section 901

was patterned.

Further,

22 as we note in our brief. Representative O'Hara had said that
23 what they had done in preparing Title 9 was take a copy of
24 Title 6 and just cut and paste it, mark out Section 601 and
25 make 901, mark out 604 and make 904, but when you took that

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and added to it the amendments to Title 7 in the Equal Pay

2 Act,

it made no sense whatsoever, and thus it was dropped

3 out.

QUESTION;

4

Ms. Krell, the suggestion has been made

5 the case is moot in view of the new attitude taken by the
6 department.

Do you have any comment on that?

MS. KRELLs

7
8 the

Yes, Your Honor.

It is not, because

Justice Department apparently has not gone along with

9 the proposal of the Department of Education.

President

10

Carter had delegated his authority that was given to him

11

under Section 902 to approve the regulations promulgated

12

pursuant to 901 to the Attorney General, and when the

13 Department of Education
14 regulations along

had proposed a revision of the

the lines we have been discussing,

15 apparently that was not agreed

to by Justice, because right

16 after we saw that letter, we got the Justice Department’s
17 brief, which indicates it intends to pursue this matter.

QUESTION;

18

So we have a conflict between the two

19 departments of government.
20

MS. KRELLs

QUESTION;

22 opinions.
23 others,

Yes, apparently we do.
Now, you mentioned these 16 court

The Fifth Circuit is out of line with some of the

24

MS. KRELL;

QUESTION;

Yes.
I would appreciate your comments on

1

Dougherty.
MS. KRELL:

2

The Fifth Circuit holds the

3 regulations invalid as written because they are not program
4 specific, and they are not directed to the employees in
5 certain programs receiving federal financial assistance, but
6 rather are broader,

and would just cover all employees

7 conducted by a recipient of federal financial assistance.
QUESTION:

8

Would you be happy with that kind of a

9 resolution?
MS. KRELL:

10
11

No, Your Honor, because we think

employment was not intended to be covered by Section 601.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. KRELL:

14

QUESTION:

At all?
Right.
Even though an employee might have

15 something to do with the students who are protected and the
16 like?
17

MS. KRELL:

In those very narrow circumstances

18 where the discrimination against the employees is so
19 widespread that the students are precluded from having a
20 non-discriminatory
21 operate in

environment, where the students cannot

a non-discriminatory educational institution,

22 then to remedy the discrimination against students,

a remedy

23 or some solution to the problem of employment discrimination
24 might have to be addressed.
25

QUESTION:

Isn’t that in essence the Fifth
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Circuit's approach?
MS. KRELL;

2

No, I think they went further than

3

that, because they did not limit it to cases where the

4

discrimination against employees was wide-ranging throughout

5

an entire educational institution.
QUESTION*

6

But I take it you would be content with

7

the more narrow one that you have just described, the more

8

narrow than the Fifth Circuit.

9

MS. KRELL*

Where employment in general is not

10

covered, but only in specific instances where it is

11

necessary to protect the students, in those circumstances,

12

yes.

13

QUESTION;

I take it the department's position --

14

I am sure we will learn what it is -- but it would accept a

15

regulation that was just program-oriented.

16

MS. KRELL*

I believe the department said it would

17

favor regulations where there was a clear nexus established

18

between discrimination against the employees and

19

discrimination against the students.

20

QUESTION:

Ms. Krell, did I understand you to

21

suggest that the Secretary could not withdraw these

22

regulations without the approval of the Justice Department?

23

MS. KRELL:

24

QUESTION;

25

Right.

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, the new regulations that are

proposed haven't gone into effect.

The old ones are still

The old regulations are still in

Of the AttorneyGeneral.
But there has been a notice of -It has not been published, Your Honor.
I see.
We saw it in the Daily Labor Report.

13 We do not know what the regulations themselves say.
14

What HEW did in the regulations was go much

15 further than the statutory language chosen, and they
16 attempted to rewrite the statutory scheme by means of
17 regulations, which they cannot do.

They very explicitly put

18 into the very first regulation in question that general
19 prohibition on employment discrimination, which had been

20 rejected by Congress.
21

They further, recognizing that if employment was

22 to be covered, there were certain situations in which there
23 had to be exceptions, put in a bona fide occupational
24 qualification into the regulations, which had also been
25 missing from the statutory language.

So I think the

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

regulations in question go much further than that which was

intended by Congress, and as such they must be declared

invalid by this Court.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. KNAG, ESQ.,

5

6

Mr. Knag.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER TRUMBULL BOARD OF EDUCATION
MR. KNAG:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

8

Court, I represent the Trumbull Board of Education.

9

the Trumbull Board of Education declined to renew the

After

10

contract of a non-tenured guidance counselor, Linda Potz,

11

Ms. Potz commenced seven different actions and proceedings

12

in various forums, including a claim under the Subpart E

13

regulations promulgated by HEW under Title 9, and so, we too

14

commenced an action seeking to declare the Subpart E

15

regulations to be invalid.
Ms. Krell has described how the structure of the

16
17

statute shows clearly an intent by Congress to regulate

18

employment by its amendments to the Equal Pay Act, and Title

19

7, and on the other hand to address beneficiaries by Section

20

901, and that analysis is strongly buttressed by an analysis

21

of the derivation and legislative history of this section.

22

As this Court pointed out in Cannon, Section 601

23

was the basis of Section 901.

Title 9 was derived from

24

Title 6.

25

in 1963, he proposed a Title 6 which would have covered

And when President Kennedy first proposed Title 6

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 employment expressly.

However, the committee later deleted

2 that language, and noted that employment was now being
3 covered under Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
4

Once that coverage of employment was deleted from

5 Title 6, both the floor leaders and the Justice Department,
6 which was the principal proponent of the legislation, went
7 out of their way to make clear the intention that Title 7 -8 Title 6 was generally not intended to cover employment.
9

For example, a Justice Department memorandum

10 stated, "The mere fact that an aid recipient violated Title
11 7 would not itself warrant termination of aid.

Moreover,

12 the agency administering the aid would not adopt a
13 non-discrimination in employment provision in connection
14 with its aid program unless assistance to employment was one

15 of the purposes of the program."
16

As Ms. Krell pointed out, this all occurred before

17 the Section 604 language was ever added to the statute, and
18 when they did add Section 604 to the statute, Senator
19 Humphrey went out of his way to make clear that "We have

20 expressed in specific language what has always been
21 intended."

In other words, Section 604 did not change the

22 meaning of Section 601 .
23

QUESTION*

24 you explain those?
25

SR. KNAG*

Senator Birch Bayh's statements, how do
He was the chief Senate sponsor.
That's right.

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION*

1

2 indicating

3

And did he not make several statements

that he thought employment was covered?
MB. KNAG*

Senator Bayh made a number of

4 statements, and those included, first of all, the statement
5 that Title 6 and Title 9 were identical, the statement that
6 Section 901

applied to beneficiaries of federal funds, and

7 also -8

QUESTION!

So you would say he was just confused

9 about the whole thing?
10

MR. KNAG:

That is one interpretation, and that is

11

the interpretation that was adopted, in effect, by most of

12

the courts which considered his remarks.

But there is

13 another possible explanation, and that is, as Ms. Krell
14 noted, we recognize that under certain circumstances where,
15 for example, in order to effectuate a desegregation decree
16 you need to have provisions concerning faculty assignment.
17 Title 6 did cover employment, and so we agree that in
18 certain circumstances Title 9 does cover employment.
19

But nowhere in Senator Bayh's remarks is there any

20 statement that he intended
21

to provide more coverage in the

area of sex discrimination than in the area of race

22 discrimination.

23

QUESTION*

Why are plaintiffs anxious to bring

24 themselves under the coverage of Title 9?

Is it because of

25 the potential to cut off federal funds to the employing
15

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 agency?
2

MR. KNAG:

I don't think so.

The respondent in

3 this case has gone out of her way to point out that there
4 has been no threat of a cutoff of federal funds in this
5 case.

It would certainly make no sense to cut off school

6 lunch funds, because —
7

QUESTION:

Well, if remedies are available under

8 other programs like Title 7, I just wondered why you thought
9 plaintiffs would be anxious to come under this -10

MR. KNAG:

Unfortunately, in this area. Justice

11 O'Connor, we have been confronted with a reductio ad

12 absurdium of the doctrine of overlapping remedies, and it
13 becomes a test of wills, a test of endurance to get through
14 to the end of one of these cases.
15

QUESTION:

Well, you are more familiar with it,

16 perhaps, since you have been working on this particular
17 problem.

Is there any other federal program in which any of

18 these plaintiffs were involved that would have resulted in
19 the cutoff of federal funds if they were successful?

20

HR. KNAG:

The records don't show that either

21 plaintiff were engaged in any federal program, and our

22 complaint is that HEW went in and investigated these matters
23 without even inquiring on that subject, because that is what
24 the regulations say.

It just makes no sense to construe

25 this statute, Title 9, as authorizing the cutoff of funds

MR. LEE#

1

— that we are right in this case.

2 turn first to the language.

I

On its face, it clearly

3

includes employment.

It says no person shall be subjected

4

to discrimination, and person clearly includes employment.

5

Title 9*s kinship to Title 6 has been noted.

6 contain the same language.
7

10

Title 6 does not pertain to

employment, but Title 6 contains this express disclaimer.

8 Title 9
9

Title 6 does

does not.
I recognize the argument that my opponents have

made that 604 in Title 6 was just there for purposes of

11 clarification.

I will simply refer to Pages 34 and 35 by

12

brief, and note that that issue is far from clear.

But

13

analysis should not tarry there, because in any event, even

14

if it was only in the statute for purposes of clarification,

15

once you put a 604 clarifier onto a 601 basic prohibition,

16

then any future Congress that wants to prohibit

17

discrimination by using the 601 prototype needs to use the

18

clarifier with it, because once the clarifier has been used,

19

the defect becomes a procedure of art, if you will, and it

20 must be used if the purpose is to exclude employment.
21

The case here is, of course, much stronger,

22 because a Section 604 counterpart was included by the House
23

version of the 1972 Act and taken out in conference.

The

24

legislative history concerning the reason for that deletion

25

is short, but equally clear.

The conference report devotes
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

two sentences to the matter.

The first sentence describes

2 the difference between the House and Senate version,
3 second sentence states simply,

and the

"The House recedes."

Now, in response to a question by Justice

4

5 O'Connor, there was suggested a different reason for the
6 deletion of
7 report.

Section 904 than the one given by the conference

It is suggested that the reason for that change was

8 simply to correct a drafting mistake because the bill was
9 obviously inapplicable, or rather, the disclaimer was
10

obviously inapplicable, and it was, to other parts of the

11

1972 amendment, namely, that part that extended the coverage

12

of Title 9 and the Equal Pay Act.

13

This is an inadequate explanation for two

14 reasons.

The first is that receding and correcting are two

15 different things.

The conference knew which it was doing

16 and said which it was doing.

The conference report does not

17 say that the conferees picked up a mistake, and nowhere in
18 the legislative history is there even the slightest hint
19 that what they were doing was to correct a mistake.

The

20 language that they used was the language that says that
21

there was a substantive difference between the Senate and

22 the House, and that on that issue it was the Senate version
23 that prevailed.
24

QUESTION:

I take it, Mr. Solicitor General, you

25 feel the legislative history is crystal clear.

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

ME. LEEs

It really is, Justice Blackmun.

2 crystal clearif you read it against
3 of those perspectives is a time

one.

It is

two perspectives.
If you look at it

One
from

4 the standpoint -- in recognition of the fact that whereas
5 from 1972 -- from 1970 to 1972 there were four — three or
6 four efforts, depending on how you count, to include some
7 kind of guarantee in the civil rights laws of the United
8 States providing against discrimination against women in
9 education, and much of the legislative history that is
10 quoted from and that might imply therefore some confusion
11 comes from those earlier efforts, the 1970 and the 1971

12 efforts.
13

The legislative history that really counts the

14 most occurred

all on one single day, and it consists of

15 statements by

one Senator.

The caseprobably is not unique

16 in this respect, but it certainly is distinctive.

Now, the

17 reason that the statements by Senator Bayh on that

18 particular day are so important is this.

The version that

19 eventually prevailed was the Senate version.

20 one that became law.

That is the

The Senate version was passed on the

21 same day that it was introduced by Senator Bayh as an

22 amendment to an existing Senate bill.

It didn’t go through

23 committee.
24

So that introduction, debate, and final Senate

25 passage all occurred on the same day.

And as a consequence,

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the views of Senator Bayh are the only views that were

2 expressed in the legislative history,

and his views really

3 are the legislative history, because of the peculiar way
4 that this particular bill

was passed.

5

Now, the second --

QUESTION:

MR. LEE:

QUESTION:

The position of the Senate was —

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. LEEs

That is correct

2

Now, the second perspective with respect to the

That is correct

3 legislative history and what in my view. Justice Blackmun,
4 makes it so crystal clear, is a distinction that everyone
5 recognizes between the two parts of this particular
6 proposal.

Senator Eayh did two things with these

7 amendments.

One was to propose Title 9, which prohibited

8 sex discrimination in educational institutions receiving
9 federal funds.

The second part of the amendment was an

10 extension of both Title 7 and also the Equal Pay Act.
11

Now, it is true, as my opponents have pointed out,

12 that some portions of the legislative history can be read as
13 applicable to Title 7 or the Equal Pay Act, but there is
14 simply no answer to these two compelling propositions, and I
15 have never seen any answer to either of these propositions.
16

The first is that nowhere in Senator Bayh's

17 statements and nowhere in the legislative history is there

18 any suggestion that the many statements concerning
19 employment apply only to Title 7 and the Equal Pay Act.

20 There is nothing to that effect.
21

QUESTION*

General Lee, is there or more properly

22 was there when Senator Bayh spoke a recognized definition of
23 the

24

word "program”?
MR. LEE;

I don’t think there is very much in — I

25 don’t remember anything, frankly, on discussion of that

MR. LEE:

QUESTION;

In one of the footnotes to your brief,

MR. LEE:

That is correct.

9

QUESTION;

That is correct.

You want it to take over an area in

10 which EEOC has had more than a little.
11

MR. LEE;

No, and I think that is again outside

12 the scope of what we are talking about here, and it may very
13 well be for those reasons.
14

QUESTION:

Is it outside of the scope of the

15 Congress to enact parallel legislation that gives options to
16 employees in some Instances with elaborate procedure and
17 others with none?

18

MR. LEE;

19 of the question.

I apologize.
Certainly not.

I misunderstood the scope

20 Gardner-Denver and other cases has noted the overlapping of

This

Let me turn now second --

Mr. Solicitor -- yes, I wanted to hear

your second proposition.
MR. LEE;

That is what I want to hear, too.

Justice Stevens.

8

(General laughter.)

9

MR. LEE;

The second proposition is that the

10

Congressional Record had three separate parts of Senator

11

Bayh’s statements containing at least, oh, eight or ten

12

separate references that are only consistent with

13

applicability to Title 9, and that under no circumstances

14

can fairly be read as applicable either to Title 7 or to the

15

Equal Pay Act, and I would like to review those just briefly.

16

First, in his introductory remarks, the Senator

17

describes his amendment, and he says that the heart of this

18

amendment is a provision banning sex discrimination in

19

educational programs receiving federal funds, which is

20 clearly Title 9.
21

That is not Title 7 or the Equal Pay Act.

He then goes on to say that the amendment would

22 cover such crucial aspects as admissions procedures,
23

scholarships, and faculty employment, and then in the very

24

next sentence he says other important provisions in the

25

amendment would extend the equal employment opportunity
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 provisions in Title 7 and the Equal Pay Act .
2

Now, they just can't get much clearer than that,

3 that the heart of the amendment is Title 9, which covers
4 admissions, student services, and faculty employment, and
5 that other important provisions extend to Title 7 and the
6 Equal Pay Act.
7

QUESTION;

Mr. Lee, I see your yellow light is on,

8 and I am very concerned about one aspect of the case and
9 your views on it.

The fact that the Act is framed in terms

10 of programs and the view of at least one court that the
11

regulations to be valid must address themselves to programs,

12 and not in the broad general terms of these regulations.
13 Would you address that, please?
MR. LEE;

14
15

Yes, we agree, Justice O'Connor, that

the programs that the — that this is a program specific

16 statute.

There is some question, frankly, as to whether

17

these regulations are or are not program specific.

As we

18

point out in our brief, you can make an argument that they

19

are program specific.

It is very likely after this case is

20 over that the Department of Education will want to have
21

another look at that issue, and of course on that issue we

22 agree with the Department of Education.
23

In any event, it is very clear because of the

24

posture of this case that that issue is not before this

25

Court at this time.
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

You don’t agree with the Fifth

2 Circuit's reading of the regulation necessarily,

but you

3 agree with its rationale,

MR. LEE:

I think the Fifth Circuit opinion is a

5 very fine opinion.

The only thing that they did wrong was

4

6 just throwing out

all the regulations.

Other than that,

7 they are dead right.

25 so persuasive is Senator Bayh's part by part analysis.

13

happened in connection with the statute, and he said, this

portion of the amendment covers discrimination in all areas

where abuse has been mentioned, employment practices for

16

faculty and administrators, scholarship aid, and admissions.

17

I do not have time to cover the exchange between Senator

Bayh and Senator Pell, but it is equally persuasive.

19

And I don’t give that one any more credence
Those don't count.

This was on

At all points it becomes overwhelmingly persuasive

20

that the Congress that passed the education amendments of

21

1972, a decade ago, regardless of what is good policy,

22

regardless of what anyone might think today, intended that

matters but also to employment.

Of course there are.

That is covered also.

Of

3 course there are references to Title 7 and the Equal Pay
4 Act.

That is covered also.

But there are a number of

5 references, too many to be ignored, that can only apply to
6 employment discrimination.

QUESTION*

Again, now, confining ourselves to

Is it your view that the plain language

Oh, yes.

whatever ?
HR. LEE;

2

Well, if you read it on its face without

3 comparing it to Title 6, it is very plain,

It says no

4 person shall he subject to discrimination,

The ambiguity

5 comes in in the comparison to Section 6, an d then you have
6 to make the comparison to Section 6,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BEVERLY J. HODGS ON, ESQ.,

17

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT LINDA POTZ
MS. HODGSON;

18

Ms. Hodgso n .

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the

19 Court, I represent the private respondent i n this case,
20 Linda

Potz.

Three years ago, after an inve stigation , the

21

Department of Health, Education, and Welfar e found that the

22

Trumbull Board of Education had violated Ti tie 9 when it

23 demeaned Ms. Potz before her colleagues and students, when
24 it asked her to falsify a report which woul d have shown
25 unequal services to female students, and wh en it terminated
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 her employment, leaving female junior high school students
2 without a female guidance counselor.
3

The Trumbull Board of Education complains that Ms.

4 Potz has pursued multiple remedies.

I suggest that the

5 record shows that some of her proceedings merely addressed
6 gross irregularities in the termination proceedings, and
7 certainly no inference should be drawn from those.
8

Ms. Potz's complaint of discrimination went in the

9 very first instance to the agency which has special
10 expertise concerning education.

It went to HEW.

Only after

11 the district court had enjoined the Title 9 employment
12 regulations did Ms. Potz resort to Title 7.
13

Justice O'Connor has expressed interest in why

14 private litigants would be interested in complaining to HEW
15 rather than to the EEOC.

The reason for that is that the

16 EEOC has no special expertise concerning the education
17 setting.

It has no particular knowledge of the ways in

18 which that setting, in which decisions in that setting may
19 differ.

20

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting that EEOC's

21 jurisdiction is limited to the particular employers as to
22 which EEOC has great expertise?
23

Are you suggesting that EEOC would not

8 be adequate to deal with a similar claim in the laboratories

10 and how laboratories operate?
11

MS. HODGSON;

I think the EEOC's expertise is

12 probably best developed with regard to industry.

I am

13 suggesting only that there may be a superior familiarity of
14 HEW, because it deals with education all of the time.

The

15 other reason for resort to HEW is that the EEOC, as this
16 Court knows, has labored under an enormous burden of a case
17

load which it cannot keep up with.

The record indicates in

18 this case HEW was able to come in, do a thorough
19

investigation, and come up with findings within a year.

20 That is a very substantial difference, and since this Court
21

has shown great interest in the idea of resolving these

22 problems at the administrative level, it is a difference of
23

which note should be taken.

MS. HODGSON*

It is unsettled whether the

4

availability of administrative remedies is greater under

5

Title 9.

Clearly, there is a provision for fund

We do not urge that remedy —

MS. HODGSON*

Yes.

Is that it?

However, the remedies offered

under Title 9 can also be attuned finely to the perception

16 by HEW that employment discrimination is having an impact on
17

students. It has been brought to this Court’s attention that

18

there is a vast body of social science literature indicating

19

that there is a real lesson to students when female teachers

3

QUESTION:

In what sense a more complete remedy?

4

MS. HODGSON*

Well, for instance, the Department

5 of Education might find that in order to get rid of this

6 infection of the school program it might want some extra
7 publicity so that students would see that the injustice that

8 they may have drawn some conclusions from would be undone.
9 That would not be a typical sort of remedy under Title 7.
10

QUESTION;

Yes, but all that the teacher would be,

11 I gather, reinstatement and back pay, isn't it?
12

MS. HODGSON*

With regard to the teacher, yes.

I

13 am suggesting that the reason that Title 9 governs

14 employment is because the employment does have an effect on
15 students, and that that effect can be adjusted by the
16 administrative agency which knows about that effect.

17

The present change of position by the

18 administering agency is not really germane.

The standard of

19 review here is not what the agency's philosophy is now, and
20 it is not what other courts’ philosophy might have been as
21 to an efficient administrative scheme.

The flaw with the

22 Alvo, the Romeo, the Seattle cases are all that these courts
23 decided to look into how they thought this regulation should
24 best be enacted, not according to the standard of review
25 which this Court has said is germane to administrative

regulations
As recently as last month, the court decided in

2

3 Federal Election Commission versus Democratic Senatorial
4 Campaign Commission that an administrative action is valid
5 as long as it is not inconsistent with the statutory
6 purpose.

As the Solicitor General has indicated, there was

7 a statutory purpose here to avoid the use of federal funds
8 to support discrimination.

This Court has so found in

9 Cannon versus University of Chicago, that one of the
10

purposes of Title 9 was to keep those who accept federal

11

largesse from using it in a discriminatory manner, and the

12

view that these regulations should be inspected as to their

13 efficiency is simply one which does not comport either with
14 this recent case I have just cited or with the Mourning case
15 or the other precedents from this Court which show deference
16 to administrative regulations and to the contemporaneous
17 view of the agency which accepts the mandate of interpreting
18 the statute.
19

There is no confusion by Senator Bayh when he

20 addressed the question.
21

The division in his remarks was

not, as the petitioners suggest, a division between remedies

22 for faculty members and remedies for students.

Rather, the

23 division was, remedies concerning recipients of federal
24 funds and remedies concerning other kinds of educational
25 institutions which did not receive funds.
39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I would point out that the record does not permit

2 any inquiry into the program specificity question because
3 despite Ms. Potz's effort to make a record concerning
4 infection of the educational program and the loss of equal
5 services

to students, the district court enjoined all of the

6 regulations

on their face, and that this is not therefore an

7 instance

in which program specificity is really raised as an

8 issue to

be decided by this Court.

9

There is no indication in the legislative history

10 or in the language of the statute that Title 7 and the Equal
11 Pay Act were ever intended to be the exclusive remedies, and

12 this Court has recognized the validity of overlapping
13 remedies.

There is no reason for the Court to depart from

14 that recognition in this case whatever its own view of

15 efficiency might be.

The question is whether at the time of

16 enactment, with broad language which contained no exemption
17 concerning employment, it was proper for the Department of
18 HEW to include regulation of employment because of its
19 expertise in that area.

20

The Court in reviewing other discrimination

21 statutes has taken note of departures from prior models.

In

22 the context of age discrimination, the Court has said that
23 where Title 7 is abandoned and different procedures are
24 engrafted, that difference will be respected,

and the change

25 from the Section 604 model of Title 6 must similarly be

given effect.
I urge then that the Court affirm what the Second

3

Circuit's view has been, and I suggest that the number of

4

court decisions is of nowhere near as much significance as

5

the validity of the reasoning, and in this case the

6

application of the traditional standard for judicial review

7

of administrative actions favors upholding those regulations

8

as enacted.

Mr. Knag.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL E. KNAG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER TRUMBULL BOARD OF EDUCATION
MR. KNAG;

Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to

13

correct several things that were said.

14

suggested that back pay is awardable under Title 9.

15

simply point out, although that is not an issue in this

16

case, several courts have now held that damages are not

17

awardable under Title 9.

18

First of all, it was
I would

I would also like to get to the statements by the

19

Solicitor General concerning his two big points about why

20

the legislative history shows that Congress intended to

21

cover employment under Section 901.

22

Senator Bayh doesn't state one way or the other whether he

23

intended employment to be covered exclusively under Title 7

24

and the Equal Pay Act.

25

Now, the fact is that

The fact is also that the Solicitor General made

which he

We don't think it must

But then he quoted what he said was

Well, the fact is that he didn't quote

7 the next sentence.

The very next sentence talked about the

8 parallelism

between Title 6 and Title 9, and similarly, the

9 other statement that he specifically referred

to here talks

10

about employment discrimination, and then in the very next

11

sentence, again in the very next sentence talks about the

parallelism to Title 6.

so the focus clearly of this part is on student

18 discrimination, and

the way to reconcile that passing

19 reference to employment discrimination if you construe it to

refer to Section 901 is that he intended that it would be

21 covered

in the same way that it was covered under Title 6.
