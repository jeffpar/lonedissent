1 have been directed, although the statute and regulations
2 specifically provide that it is only a specific form of
3 writing signed by the serviceman which is effective to
4 create or to change a beneficiary designation.
5

QUESTION;

So that the -- I suppose your answer to

6 the next question would be that it wouldn't make any
7 difference if a copy of the decree had been filed with the
8 Armed Services and the insurance company.
9

MR. BEALE:

That is correct.

Under a prior form

10 of insurance, the former National Service Life Insurance
11 program, such a document might possibly have been
12 effective.

However, in enacting the statutes and the

13 regulations under the Servicemen's Group Life, the SGLI
14 program, the manner in which beneficiaries can be created
15 and changed is very specifically set forth by the statute
I6and the regulations, and that requires that the beneficiary
17 designation be in writing, signed by the serviceman and
18received by the appropriate military unit before the
19insured's death.
20

QUESTION;

And that authority -- that authority to

21 change the beneficiary cannot be waived or diminished by the
22 insured person?
23

NR. BEALE:

24 una 1terable right,

That is correct.

He has the

the unlimited right to change the

25 designat ion at any time, not to inform the prior

MR. BEALE:
QUESTION:

Pardon?
Did the insured Sergeant leave an

estate, a probate estate?
MR. BEALE:

It is — I do not know the exact

13

details of his probate estate, but it is my understanding

14

that it was minimal if at all, if he left an estate at all.

15

QUESTION:

So that if there is an action for

16

breach of contract against the estate, you don’t know

17

whether it would be enforceable or collectable.

18
19

MR. BEALE:

It would be our position, Your Honor,

that -- it’s an open question as to whether or not there is

20 an action permissible against the estate for breach of
21

contract, but if that were deemed to be appropriate, I

22 cannot provide you with a definitive answer as to whether or
23

not there would be a full recovery of the amount of the

24

policy proceeds or not.

25

would not be, but I cannot absolutely say that.

It’s my understanding that there

SR. BEALE;

That is correct.

But I'ra arguing on

2 behalf of Prudential and the designated beneficiary.
3

The -- as the -- after this divorce and the

4 subsequent remarriage and the designation of the second
5 wife. Sergeant Ridgway — and he executed this beneficiary
6 designation in the manner provided for under the statute and
/regulations which provided that the benefits be paid by law,
8 which under the order of precedence had the effect of paying
9his widow, if he had one when he died.

Donna Ridgway did

10 continue to be married to Sergeant Ridgway when he died
11 several months later.

She thereupon filed a proper claim

12 for the benefits in the appropriate form.

Another claim was

13 filed by April Ridgway on behalf of the minor children under
14 the divorce decree.
15

Prudential stated its affirmative intention to pay

16 the designated beneficiary,

Donna, the second wife.

April

17 thereupon sued Prudential seeking a declaratory judgment
18 that she was entitled to the proceeds and seeking injunctive
19relief to prevent Prudential from paying Donna.
20

QUESTION;

I'm a little curious as to why

21 Prudential is so involved and upset and concerned.

Why

22 don't they pay the money into court?
23

MR. BEALE;

Because -- Prudential has taken an

24affirmative position in wanting to pay the designated
25 beneficiary not because of the first wife-second wife issue,

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

Well, that isn’t a very uncommon

5 situation in controversies over insurance policy proceeds,
6 and insurers are always paying into court.
7

MR. BEALE:

Well, I think that what is going to

9 carrier in a very substantial number of cases in which it,
10 even if has to just interplead and pay the proceeds into
11 court and attempt to get out of this, sir, is going to
12 involve a substantial expense of time and energy and legal
13 expense in doing that.

2

MR. BEALE*

That is an interesting question.

The

3 military -- the Congress has determined that this is a
4 benefit that would be offered to the military.

In setting

5 up this particular form of military insurance, in contrast
6 to prior forms. Justice Rehnquist, the government is not the
7 insurer.

The legislation specifically provided that a

8 contract would be entered into between the Veterans
9 Administrator and a private contract carrier to provide the
10 coverage, and that is Prudential's role.

It reinsures a

11 great deal of this insurance with other parties, but it is
12 standing in lieu of the government for purposes of this
13 particular insurance program.

So therefore, any ill effects

14 of it reflect poorly on the carrier, poorly on the military,
15 and may ultimately weaken the attractiveness of the life
16insurance as an inducement to military service.

4 at issue in Wissner, that that was a model for both the
5 Court's opinion and the dissent on the federal statute in
6 which the federal interest is enunciated with force and
7 clarity to which the competing state interest did
8 substantial harm, and it was resolved in favor of a
9determination of preemption.

That preemption issue was

10 determined in favor of the federal interest by virtue of the
11 Supremacy Clause.

QUESTION;

Do you suggest, Mr. Beale, that we

13 can't decide against you without overruling Wissner?
14

MR. BEALE;

Wissner was technically a community

15 property case, Your Honor, and not one involving issues
16 directly.
17

QUESTION;

18

MR. BEALE;

Well, it was an NSLI, too, and not —
It was NSLI, but the beneficiary

19 designation provisions and the spendthrift provisions, the
20anti-attachment provisions of the two statutes are virtually
21 identical.
22

QUESTION;

Well, I repeat my question;

do you

23 think we can decide against you without overruling Wissner?

24

MR. BEALE;

I think it is possibly, Your Honor, by

25-- simply by virtue of the fact that there is a distinction

5

QUESTION;

There's another difference, too, in

6 that the policy holder there had not made any commitment not
7 to designate anybody else as a beneficiary, but here he did.
8

MB. BEALE*

That is true, but he subsequently made

9 another, perfectly valid beneficiary designation.
10

QUESTION;

I understand, but that's a difference

11 between the two cases.

MR. BEALE*

But there is a difference in the two

13 cases.

QUESTION*

16

Wissner, there was only one beneficiary

The question was whether it was a good one.

MR. BEALE;

That is right, and Wissner is not a

I would reserve the balance of my time.

1 is retained at all times, and we believe this is consistent
2 with the statutory language which expressly provides that
3 the benefits be paid to whomsoever he designates, and that
4 therefore he has the right to change his mind.
5

But whether or not that is true, the additional

6point which was raised earlier was the fact that this was
7 not receiving in writing.

In fact, although the record is

8 somewhat unclear on this point and the government obviously
9 has no view on the matter, it appears that there was not in
10 fact, likely was not a written separation agreement, so
11 there is failure to comply with the requirements of
12 designation of intent in that respect, and -13

21 in the event that a separation agreement is entered,

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 statute gives the man the absolute right to change
2 beneficiaries no matter how faithfully he has promised not
3 to do so and how many courts have ordered him not to do so.
4 He has a federal right to change beneficiary in breach of a
5 separation agreement.
6

MR. SCHWARTZ:

We would suggest that that is

7 correct.

On the other hand, as an alternative argument, we

8 would suggest that if -- if the effect of a court order is
9 to somehow limit that -- and we would suggest that a state
10 court doesn't have the power under the statute to so order
11 -- that may not be enforced against the proceeds of the
12 policy, and obviously we have no information or view as to
13 whether, whether there are other assets available here, but
14 we think it is not a small point that a distinction be drawn
15 between enforcement of his promise as opposed to imposition
16 of a constructive trust on the proceeds.
17

It seems to us that one of the things that is

18 essentia 11y different about this military service policy
19from other life insurance situations, putting aside the
20 convenience of the insurer or anything such as that, is that
21 it is a program intended for mass application for people
22 sometimes serving overseas.

It is intended to be simple.

23 Congress designed it so that one is presumptively enrolled
24 unless one opts out.
25

In the discussion in the legislative history you

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 find references to things such as the fact that that was
2 intended to cover POWs in Vietnam.

It was all intended to

3 be very simple, cut and dried so that the serviceman might
4 know that when he signed on this form that is provided by
5 the military, which is within -- a copy of which is within
6 the record, that he could rest assured that that beneficiary
7 would receive those proceeds.
8

And we would submit that the Maine court, in

9 supposing that by getting the insurance company off the hook
10 as they purported to view, took a very restrictive view of
11 what Congress intended.

We would suppose that, all other

12things being equal. Congress would be more content to have
13 Prudential litigating this than to have Donna Ridgway or
14 people in her position faced with the burden of litigating
15 this.

We would suppose that part of what Congress meant was

l6not only that there be financial security, but that this
17 lawsuit not have occurred, and yet it obviously has, and
18 therefore we share the view that a clear judgment of this
19Court having the effect that this insurance policy simply
20 could not be an asset, could not be a chip in the bargaining
21 in a separation agreement process would be beneficial.
22

The Respondents have suggested that that would be

23 anomalous, make the insurance policy worthless and so on,
24 but in many respects that would place this insurance on a
25 similar basis -- on a basis similar to other insurance.

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 Other insurance may be cancelled for nonpayment of premiums,
2 it may be cancelled because one is no longer eligible for
3 health reasons, and it is, I think most divorce lawyers
4 know, a very risky asset to take in a separation agreement,
5 and contrary to what Respondents suggested, it would
6 probably be beneficial were that clear to all counsel.

And

7 certainly a judgment of this Court to that effect would do
8 so.
9

One other point I'd like to address is that there

10 really can't be any question here that Congress was aware
11 that it was superseding the application of state law in
12 providing the right to designate the beneficiary by virtue
13 of the fact that Congress did not simply ignore the
14 existence of state law.

In the table of order of

15 precedence, down at the bottom, when you get to No. 5 and
16 No. 6, referring to the executor of the estate or next of
17 kin controlled by state law, those effectively incorporate
18state law.

So Congress, aware of what it was doing, placed

19 state law down at the bottom of the list.
20

The government's interest in this case is

21 obviously not identical with Sergeant Ridgway's, and we
22 don't particularly have a brief for the facts of this case.
23 Our brief is obviously for the program, and we suggest that
24 in general it would be best if the sanctity of the
25 serviceman *s designation were upheld in all respects, and

28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that if, as Congress may deem it appropriate to devise a
2 system whereby effect may be given to a state judgment, that
3 is best fashioned by Congress.
4

In this regard, it might be worthwhile to point

5 out that subsequent to the filing of the briefs in this
6 case. Congress has adopted legislation which alters the
7 result in Hisquierdo, doesn't overturn the Court's decision
8 nor suggest that it was wrong.

It creates a uniform federal

9 solution under the Railroad Retirement Act which Congress
10 deemed equitable.

It is national in application.

It does

11 not turn on whether it's a community property state or not.
12 Obviously this is something the Court could not do, could
13 not have done in Hisquierdo.

And the newspapers also tell

14 us tha Congress is considering uniform national solutions to
15introduce some kind of equity for divorced spouses which
16would alter the result in McCarty but not suggest that it be
17 overruled directly.
18

These are matters which Congress is clearly

19addressing closely.

It is much more within the province of

20 Congress to make the kind of fine adjustments which would be
21 appropriate, perhaps.

The judgment is for Congress in

22 certain circumstances, but there seems to no need to subject
23the beneficiaries of a Servicemen's Group Life Insurance
24 policy to the kind of constructive trust which was imposed
25 in this case.

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The Court in its recent decisions in Hisquierdo

2 and McCarty has outlined a two-step test for judging matters
3 such as this which involve the question of preemption of
4 state law relating to marital property when it is applied to
5a federal benefit program.

We would submit that on the

6facts of this case, both of those elements are satisfied
7 because there is both a conflict between the state right
8 based on state law which is asserted, and a clear impairment
9 of the federal purpose sufficient to require that the state
10 right not be recognized.
11

The purpose of the program as we understand it was

12 to ensure that the serviceman’s intent be enforced, and
13 under the circumstances, we suggest that reversal of the
14 judgment of the Maine court is appropriate.
15

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

MR. WEBBER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

21 the Court:
22

I am sorry that I have to begin by apologizing for

23 the numerous typographical errors in the brief which I
24 discovered when I was preparing for this argument.

Rather

25 than taking the Court's time with simply detailing some of

30

1 those which may be confusing, I propose to submit something
2 to the Clerk within the next few days indicating those areas
3 where there may be some confusion because of the
4 typographical mistakes that were made.
5

This was a case in which the serviceman made an

6 agreement with his wife prior to a divorce, a fact which was
7 not mentioned by Mr. Beale in his description of the facts,
8 by which he committed himself to make his service life
9 insurance payable to his children.
10 of that contract.

He accepted the benefits

There were negotiations between the

11 parties which presumably permitted him to perhaps make lower
12 support payments, and then he subsequently refused to honor
13 it.
14

He consented to the entry of a divorce decree

15 which made his obligation to make these insurance proceeds
16 payable to his children part of the court order, and he
17later ignored that.
18

I think that on these facts -- well, I should add

19 also that finally his second wife, Petitioners argue, is
20 entitled to retain the proceeds even though they were
21 certainly a windfall to her and a result of her husband's
22illegal act in defiance of the court decree and his own
23 agreement.
24

Now, on these facts, I think we're entitled to ask

25 what overriding policies are there which would compel this

N ow, Justice Stevens asked a question ear lier

7 that is, th at although the Peti tioners have emphasi zed the
8 absolute ri ght of a serviceman to chan ge the benefi ciar y
9 under his p olicy and also have insisted there must be strict
10 compliance with that designatio n, the fact is that there are
11 a number of examples which I as sume th at Petitioner s would
12 ack nowledge d in which equitable princi pies have bee n allowed
13 to prevail over the strict lang uage of a statute or a
14 contract in which a particular person is designated as the
15 beneficiary •
16

QUESTION;

Over a federal statute?

17

MR. WEBBER;

18

What if, in our case, Donna Ridgway had -- the

Yes.

Let me give you some examples.

19second wife, had been advised by Richard that he was having
20 second thoughts and decided he wanted to name the child ren
21 after all and she killed him to prevent that from happening ,
22hoping to get away with it but it was found out?

This Court

23~~ excuse me, the circuit courts have held, and I think
24Perhaps this Coart has held under somewhat simila r
25 circumstances that when a person who murders the insured is

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 not entitled to the proceeds of the policy on equitable
2 principles, and in the Sixth Circuit, held under language
3 which was identical to that in the Servicemen's Group Life
4 Insurance, this being language dealing with federal
5 employees, which has the same language in it about the right
6 to designate beneficiaries, that the murderer could not
7 receive the proceeds of the policy.
8

Now, suppose in this case Donna had been told by

9 Richard that he wanted to change the beneficiary back to the
10 children and he gave her a form to send to New Jersey which
11 would have accomplished that, but she surreptitiously
12destroyed it and did not do what he wished.

This is a case

13 where unclean hands on the part of the claimant, Donna,
14 would bar her under well recognized decisions from
15 collecting the insurance proceeds.

And again, this is an

16example of a situation where equitable principles were
17 allowed to prevail over language of the statute.

And we cited cases in our brief in which this was
These are cases, again, involving the federal

20 employees life insurance program.
21

Now, suppose in our case that Donna had agreed

22 with Richard, again supposing he had second thoughts about
23changing the beneficiary designation, that she would hold

24 the proceeds for the benefit of his children and would make
25 sure that they received them, and he died subsequently,

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

We cited two cases

2 in which exactly this was done and a constructive trust was
3 imposed and the language of the statute involved was
4 identical with that presented in the case of Bonner.
5

QUESTION;

But there you have evidence of conduct

6 which interfered with the will and desire of the insured.
7 You don't have that here.
8

MR. WEBBER;

But, Your Honor, the point of the

9 example is not that there is interference with carrying out
10 the will of the insured, but the fact that despite
11 Petitioners* contention that absolute compliance with the
12 beneficiary designations must be insisted upon in all cases,
13 that in fact there are numerous situations where courts have
14 invoked equitable principles not to comply exactly with
15those policy designations.
16

Can you give me a case where equitable

ME. WEBBER;

In Free v. Bland, Mr. Free bought a

2 Savings Bond in the name of himself and his wife.
3 died,

Mrs.

Free

and her heirs contested the fact that Mr. Free was to

4 take, as a

survivor, take the full amount of the bond.

5 Court held

that the community property principle would have

6 to be subordinated

to the Treasury regulation specifying

7 that the survivor take
8 and noted a

This

the whole thing, but it pointed out

concession by the Solicitor General who appeared

9 as an amicus in

that case that Federal bonds would not be "a

10 sanctuary

for a wrongdoer's gains."

11

The Yiatchos case followed this, the case of Free

12 v.

Bland two years later.

In that case, Mr. Yiatchos bought

13 a Savings Bond, but this time not in ^he name of himself and
14 his wife.

He used community property, and this was a

15 community property
16 own name and
17 death,

state.

The bonds were purchased in his

the name of his brother.

Upon Mr.

Yiatchos'

there was a contest beteen his heirs and his brother.
QUESTION;

19 that's different, a

And of course, the other side says
community state, property state is

20 different from Maine.

MR. WEBBER;

25

No,
Well,

I agree with it.

MR. WEBBER;

Yes, yes, it is their position.

43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I'd like to quote the Treasury regulations just

2 very briefly which were in effect covering the bonds in that
3 case.

They stated that when either co-owner dies, "the

4 survivor will be recognized as the sole and absolute owner,"
5 and also, "no judicial determination will be recognized
6 which would defeat or impair the rights of survivorship
7 conferred by these regulations."

And I would suggest that

8 these are as definitive and positive expressions of federal
9 intent as can be found in the cases brought under the
10 Servicemen's Group Life Insurance.
11

Yet despite those regulations, this Court held in

12Yiatchos that because it was found by the court below that
13 there had been a constructive fraud on the part of Mr.
14Yiatchos in using community property in light of his
15fiduciary relationship as a manager of that property, to the
16 disadvantage of his wife, that it would not permit the
17 federal rules regarding the disposition of property to
18 become an instrument of fraud.
19

QUESTION:

Well, the difference is, is it not --

20 and I'm not an authority on community property law -- but is
21 the difference that at the time that they are alive they
22owned the property jointly, which is not true in Maine.
23

MR. WEBBER;

24

QUESTION;

25

MR. WEBBER:

That's correct.
Isn't that the difference?
But there's a difference in the fact

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that Maine is not a community property state, hut a
2 difference which is not applicable to the principle which I
3am pressing upon the Court at this point, which is that this
4 Court overrode the clear language of the Treasury
5 regulations dealing with the disposition of the Savings
6 Bonds when it found that to do so would be to permit a fraud
7

QUESTION*

I guess you're suggesting that although

8 normally the premiums are paid by withholding from the
9 serviceman's pay, I guess these policies often continue
10 after the man leaves service, and presumably he could pay
11 the premiums, the wife might -- made an agreement to have
12the wife pay the premiums, you have the same sort of facts
13 you had in Yiatchos, the wife pay the premiums on the
14understanding he wouldn't change the beneficiary, then he go
15 ahead and change it.

But the government says there's a

16federal interest in letting him change the beneficiary, even
17 though the wife pays the premium, and he agrees that that’s
18 in the consideration he won't change it.
19

MR. WEBBER*

20

QUESTION*

Is that a guestion?
I'm just thinking out loud, I guess,

21 but that's your analogy.

I think you're trying to make the

22 analogy that even in a case — that in that case, because
23 the wife contributed to the purchase of the bonds, it was a

24 fraud on her to -- for him to claim the full benefit, and
25the same kind of thing could happen with insurance.

That's

45
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 your argument I guess.
2

MR. WEBBER:

Essentially.

3 the -- I don't recall.

The case indicated that

I think it might have been -- well,

41 don't recall the name of the state, but the state court
5 held -- I think it was Washington.
6

2UESTI0N:

Washington.

7

MR. WEBBER:

That the husband is, under community

8 property law, the manager of the community property has a
9 fiduciary relationship to the spouse in that situation, and
10 it was a breach of this fiduciary relationship which
11 defrauded her of her interest in the community property
12which caused this Court to say we'll not permit the Treasury
13 regulations to be used as an instrument of fraud in this
14 instanee .
15

In Hisquierdo, this Court characterized those two

leases, distinguished those two cases, and Wissner, as being
17 — excuse me, it distinguished that case from Wissner, those
18 two, as being ones -- one in which survivorship rules in
I9federal insurance will prevail unless "fraud or breach of
20trust occurs."
21

So in Hisquierdo, this Court recognized that

22thread of distinction that was running in those other three
23 cases.
24

Now, I'd lik

25 something that Mr . Sch

46
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 argument, that is, the practical consequences of the result
2 which Petitioners seek in this case.

I would submit that if

3 the decision of the Maine Supreme Court were overruled that
4 insurance policies under the Servicemen's Group Life
5 Insurance Act will continue to be a trap for unwary persons
6 and lawyers such as myself who aren’t aware of the pitfalls
7 and difficulties of transferring federal insurance, and with
8 all due respect to this Court, I don't believe that even a
9 decision of this Court would necessarily be calculated to
10 get the word out to all persons who are practicing divorce
11 law of the dangers of dealing with federal life insurance.
121 don't know how it is in other jurisdictions, but in Maine
13 I know that there -- a very small minority of the
14 practitioners read Law Week and keep abreast of events,
15 especially in such esoteric fields of the law as this.
16

QUESTION;

Of course, Wissner was decided in about

17 1949.
18

MR. WEBBER;

That's true, but Wissner really is

19 not dispositive of this case.
20

QUESTION;

I agree, it's not dispositive, but it

21 represents a trend in the laws.
22

MR. WEBBER;

But in that case the Court did

23 distinguish the situation which would arise in a non- -24 where the obligation of the husband arose out of a marital
25 obligation, and also, there was no -- as Justice Stevens

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 mentioned earlier, there was no separation agreement, there
2was no fraud on the spouse in that situation.

So it really

3 was quite different than the case of Bonner.
4

It seems to me that the Court should take account

5 of the fact that ironically, if the result that the
6Petitioners seek is allowed, that Servicemen's Group Life
7 Insurance policies will become assets that no one will know
8 what to do with, assuming, for a moment, that lawyers
9 practicing divorce around the country do become aware of the
10 fact that there are problems in committing servicemen
11 irrevocably to keep the beneficiaries as they agree to keep
12them in a divorce decree.
13

QUESTION;

Well, with four million or more

14 veterans, most of whom have this insurance, and many of whom
15get divorces, I suppose it's filtered around rather widely.

MR. WEBBER;

16

All right, assume it -- let's assume

17 now that the word does get around, as you suggest.

Assume

18 that there's a situation in which husband and wife and their
19 attorneys are negotiating a settlement and a division of
20marital property, and one of the assets that is to be
21 decided upon is the Servicemen's Group Life Insurance

22 policy.

Let's assume he doesn't have any other life

23 insurance.

He obligates himself to support the children, to

24 provide for their medical care, perhaps, clothing allowance
25~~ these are all things that were part of the agreement in

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN P. BEALE, ESQ.,

15

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL
MR. BEALE;

16

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

May it

17 please the Court:

In brief response to several points raised by Mr.

18
19 Webber,

first, as to the unjust enrichment item, the

20 argument which
21 of

Mr.

Webber advances lose sight -- loses sight

one very fundamental, important point, which is that

22 Donna,

the second wife and designated beneficiary, is simply

23 not unjustly enriched here in that she has done nothing
24 wrong.

She has committed no improper act herself.

25 Sergeant Ridgway's legitimate wife.

2

QUESTION:

She --

Isn’t the question of unjust enrichment

3a question of state law?
4

ME. BEALE;

5

QUESTION;

I think it probably would have been.
Hasn't the Supreme Court of the State

6 of Maine decided it?
7

MR. BEALE;

On these particulr facts, not to my

8 knowledge. Your Honor.
9

QUESTION;

Didn't they hold that there was unjust

10 enrichment here?
11

MR. BEALE:

I understand your question now.

12

Yes, they did in effect, and they not only

13 declared that the remedy of a constructive trust would
14 potentially be available, which the Superior Court had
15 decided was not even available for it to consider because of
16the Supremacy Clause issue, the Maine Court went beyond that
17 and sua sponte imposed the constructive trust on the
18 proceeds without even remanding to the Superior Court.
19

QUESTION;

Well, maybe they committed all sorts of

20errors of state law, but normally we don’t review those.
21

MR. BEALE:

True.

But the central point is that I

22 think that in contradistinction to what the Maine Court
23 held, that Donna Ridgway was not unjustly enriched, in
24 short, that holding is wrong.

25

As to the Supremacy Clause --

QUESTION;

2

Would you agree with his example of say you've got

But again, is that relevant?

3

a beneficiary who murders the policyholder?

4

case?

5

MR. BEALE;

What about that

I think in that case, then, again,

6

under this particular program, the proceeds ought to be paid

7

absolutely to the

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. BEALE;

The murderer?
-- designated beneficiary, and it is

10

then incumbent upon the party whose interest has been

11

damaged to proceed accordingly.

12

13

QUESTION;

But that's what you're asking us to

hold, that in that case, as this, pay the murderer.

14

MR. BEALE;

That is correct, Your Honor.

15

As to the Supremacy Clause question, that the real

16

issue here is not whether the Supremacy Clause applies or

17

not, and whether there's a preemption issue, but how far the

18

preemption extends.

19

the Court hold that the preemption argument extends only to

20

the mechanical payment of the proceeds to the designated

21

beneficiary, and that the federal preemption then stops and

22

a constructive trust may be imposed on the proceeds in the

23

hands of the designated beneficiary.

24
25

The Respondents' argument would have

Well, that's a hollow argument.

It’s clear that

the intent here has to be that the federal preemption must

53

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 extend to the beneficial enjoyment of the proceeds.

That

2 point is made in the Hisquierdo decision, it's made again in
3 the McCarty decision, that what is really at issue is where
4the beneficial enjoyment of the proceeds ends up and not the
5 mere mechanical payment.
6

QUESTION:

Well, it would solve the insurance

7 company's problem if the trust didn't arise except in the
8 hands of the named beneficiary.
9
10

MR. BEALE:
QUESTION:

Well, this gets us back -And that you would be off the hook if

11 you paid the named beneficiary, but then the trust would

MR. BEALE:

That is nominally correct, Your Honor,

14 but for the reasons we've discussed previously, we feel that
15it is to the greater benefit of the entire program because
16 of the unique position that the insurance carrier holds in
17 lieu of the government to ensure that that result does not
18 obtain and that the proceeds are paid absolutely without
19 restriction.
