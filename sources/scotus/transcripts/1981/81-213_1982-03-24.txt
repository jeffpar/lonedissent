CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. JONES, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. JONES:

7
8

please the Court:
The issue in this case is whether differences

9
10 in
11

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the financial eligibility requirements prescribed in

Section 1903(f) of the Social Security Act for the two

12 major groups of

potential Medicaid beneficiaries violate

13 the equal protection component of
14

the Fifth Amendment.

The first group is the categorically needy.

15 Aged, blind and disabled individuals whose income is
16 less than the income limits established in the cash
17 assistance programs.

The second group is referred to as

18 the medically needy, and includes aged, blind and
19 disabled individuals whose income is greater than the
20 cash assistance limits.
21

All of the appellees are in the second group.

22 The decision in this case,

however, will not only

23 determine the constitutional validity of the differences
24 in the income requirements,
25 Congress's decision

but also, the validity of

to require participating states to

1

provide Medicaid coverage to the categorically needy but

2 not to the medically needy.

The Medicaid program was established in Title

3
4

19 of the Social Security Act and provides federal

5 financial assistance to states that choose

to pay for

6 medical treatment for certain groups of poor people.
7 States that choose to participate in the program must
8 provide Medicaid coverage to all

individuals who are

9 receiving benefits under one of two cash assistance
10 programs.
11

Either the federally-financed supplement

security income for the aged, blind and disabled

12 program, or the jointly-financed program for providing
13 aid to families with dependent children,

the AFDC

14 program.

Participating states are not required as a

15

16 general matter to provide Medicaid benefits to any other
17 group of individuals.

Therefore, a person who is not

18 eligible for benefits under one of the cash assistance
19 programs is also ineligible for benefits under the
20 Medicaid program unless his state chooses to provide
21

benefits to one of the optional categories.

22

The major optional coverage group is the

23 medically needy;

people who are ineligible for cash

24 assistance only because of the amount of their income.
25 Section

1903, however, provides that states are only

entitled to federal financial assistance for providing

2 Medicaid benefits to a medically needy individual if he

his income and the state's spend down level.

The spend down level for a person with a family of a

6 given size must not exceed

excess of the difference

133 1/3 percent of the state

AFDC payment amount for a family of the same size.
The SSI program guarantees a federal minimum

but the states may supplement that amount.

If

the state chooses to make supplemental payments to

11

individuals who are receiving SSI benefits or who would

14 benefits to

benefits except for the amount of

those individuals without regard to the 133

5

Appellees also challenge the corresponding provisions of

6 the Massachusetts Medicaid plan as inconsistent with the
7

equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
QUESTION:

8
9

eventually presented?
ME. JONES:

10

11

Was there a statutory argument

No.

Appellees represent a class

of all present and future Social Security benefit

12 recipients who live in Massachusetts, are disabled or
13

older than 65 years old, are ineligible for cash

14

assistance because of the amount of their income, and

15

have medical expenses not subject to payment by third

16

parties that are greater than the difference between

17

their countable income and the cash assistance income

18

limits.
The district court in this case held that to

19

20

the extent that Section 1903(f) requires the state of

21

Massachusetts to establish a spend down level that is

22 less than the state supplemental payment income limits,
23

the statute discriminated against appellees, in

24

violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth

25

Amendmen t.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

The district court concluded that the time for

1

2 comparing the circumstances of the medically needy
3

including the appellees, the group to whom Section

4

1903(f) applies, and the circumstances of the

5

categorically needy, to whom Section 1903(f) is not

6 applicable,
7

medical expenses.
According to the district court, at that point

8
9

was after the medically needy had incurred

there is no difference between the medically needy and

10

the categorically needy, and consequently, no basis for

11

distinguishing between the two groups, as Section

12

1903(f) does.
QUESTION;

13

Mr. Jones, is this -- your footnote

14

9, is that an example of the difference?

15

your brief, page 6, footnote 9.

16

MR. JONES;

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. JONES;

19

QUESTION;

This is an example of -How this thing works?
Yes, that is right.
And the disadvantage in dollars

20 between the two classes runs out to what?
21

Is that in

About $200 a

month?
MR. JONES;

22

Well, the difference in the spend

23

down level and the income limits is about $100.

It

24

depends on the particular category the applicants fall

25

in.

Massachusetts has different income limits for an

2

QUESTION;

3

MR. JONESi

4

QUESTION;

Yes, but it is this difference.
Right, it is that kind —
Between the two classes that is the

5 basis of the constitutional argument that that is a
6 denial of equal protection,

7

MR. JONES:

isn't it?

That is right.

And the district

8 court — and the argument of the appellees assumes that

9 the medically needy will pay the medical expenses as
10 soon as they are incurred,
11

QUESTION:

or at least —

So that if I am getting $600 a

12 month and they pay medical expenses of $250,

then they

13 are down below the level, aren't they?
14

MR. JONES;

That is right.

But they ignore

15 the fact that the medically needy might very well pay
16 the expenses over a ten-month period rather than a
17 one-month period, so that they would never end up with
18 less money for non-medical expenses than the
19 categorically needy.
20

As I mentioned, the appellees failed to raise

21 their statutory argument in

the district court.

We have

22 set out at some length the reasons we think that

23 argument is insubstantial in our reply brief, and unless
24 the Court has some questions, I will turn to the
25 constitutional argument.

QUESTION:

You don’t suggest that the

appellees are not entitled to be present it here as a

ground for affirmance?

4
5

MR. JONES:

We don’t make that argument,

although —

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. JONES:

It never was raised below.
That is right.

In fact, the

8 appellees argue that it was required by the statute, and
9

the district court proceed on that assumption, that

10

Section 1903(f) required the spend down level in

11

Massachusetts to be equal to 133 1/3 percent of the AFDC

12 payment amount, whether or not —

QUESTION:

ignore the statutory argument or meet it?
MR. JONES;

Well, I am suggesting that you

should reject it.
QUESTION:

All right.

So we should decide it

on the merits.

MR. JONES:

20

QUESTION:

And reject it and then reach the

constitutional issue.

reason, that the comparability requirement applied to

1

the case, how could we reconcile it with the spend down

2 provision?
3

HR. JONES;

4

QUESTION;

Which comparability requirement?
The statutory argument made by the

5 appellees.

HR. JONES;

6
7

The problem is that Section

1903(f) was the — was enacted in 1967.

To the extent

8 that the 65 legislation imposed any limits on the extent
9 to which the state could set a
10 down level,
11

Section 1903(f)

medically needy spend

clearly modified that

requirement, because it states without exception --

12 except for the categorically needy -- that the state
13 spend down level shall not exceed

133 1/3 percent of the

14 amount that

would be paid under the state AFDC program

15 to a family

of the same size.

16

Congress clearly did not believe that there

17 was any necessary relationship between the spend down
18 level and the cash

assistance levels.

Section 1903(f)

19 is clear on its face and it makes an exception,

an

20 express exception, for the categorically needy.
21

QUESTION;

Hr. Jones, do you know whether

22 there is any legislation pending in Congress to overcome
23 these fiscal anomalies that the appellees complain of?
24
25 Frank

HR. JONES;

Well, last year, Representative

of Hassachusetts — and according to appellees, in
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE . S.W WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202^ 554-2345

1

response to this litigation — introduced a bill that

2 would adopt exactly the statutory argument that
3 appellees press on

this Court.

4 it last term and I

am not even sure that it has been

5 referred to
6 it,

a committee.

Congress did not act on

There has been no action on

a far as we know.
Contrary to appellees’ submission and contrary

7

8 to the premise of the submission of amicus

Massachusetts

9 Association

of Older Americans, this case does not

10 involve any

post hoc rationalization of Congress's

11

action.

When Congress enacted Section 1903(f) in 1967,

12 its stated
13 In

purpose was to reduce federal expenditures.

its view, in Congress’s view, the states had been

14 much

too generous in defining who constitute the

15 medically needy.
16
17 concern

As the House committee clearly indicated its
that some of the plans operated to greatly

18 reduce the incentives for participating
19 Medicare

in the optional

program, and the committee further emphasized

20 its view that Medicaid was never intended to supplant
21 private health insurance.
22

As the Senate committee observed, a tendency

23 of some states to identify as eligibles for medical
24 assistance under Title

19 large numbers of persons who

25 could reasonably be expected to pay some or all of their

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 own medical expenses, has not only significantly
2 increased the amount of federal funds flowing into this
3 program, but has developed future cost projections at a
4 level totally inconsistent with the expectations of
5 Congress when it enacted this program in 1965.
6

Congress’s explicit purpose was to limit

7 federal expenditures, and to do so by limiting the
8 state's coverage of the medically needy.

By definition,

9 the medically needy have more income than the
10 categorically needy.

As a matter of fact, that is the

11 only difference between the two groups.
12

Furthermore, since the medically needy group

13 includes anyone who would be eligible for SSI except for
14 the amount of his income, an individual can qualify for
15 Medicaid benefits as medically needy, no matter how much
16 greater than the cash assistance limits his income might
17 be.
18

As a class, therefore, the medically needy are

19 plainly better able

than the categorically needy tc pay

20 their own medical expenses or to take steps to assure
21 that

future medical expenses can be paid by, for

22 example, purchasing private insurance.
23 exceptions,

With few

it was plain to the members of the 90th

24 Congress that the medically needy were less needy

that

25 the categorically needy.

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

All the proposals introduced in 1967 to limit

1

2 federal expenditures were directed at limiting
3 expenditures on behalf

of the medically needy.

As

4

Senator Long put it, we are talking here about the

5

people who are not on the cash public assistance rolls.

6 That is the area in which we think savings should be
7 made.

On this point, Senator Long spoke for an

8

9 overwhelming majority of Congress.

Section 1903(f)

10 distinguishes between the medically needy and the
11

categorically need because the medically needy are

12 financially better able to provide for their own medical
13 expenses.

Precisely the same reasoning underlies

14 Congress's decision to require the states or
15 participating states to cover the categorically needy
16 but

not the medically needy.

17 the distinction in Section
18 categorically needy and
19 in

20
21

Therefore, the reason for

1903(f) between the

the medically needy is implicit

the structure of the Medicaid program itself.
Now, to the extent that — to the extent

relevant in this case, section 1903(f) distinguishes

22 between two groups;

aged, blind and disabled

23 individuals whose income is less than the cash
24 assistance levies,
25 individuals

and aged, blind and disabled

whose income is greater than the cash
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 assistance levels.

Accordingly, the appropriate groups,

2 or the appropriate classifications for equal protection
3 analysis are those two.
4

Appellees’ status as social security benefit

5 recipients is completely immaterial.

There are social

6 security benefit recipients on both sides and appellees
7 don't even suggest that there are any disproportionate

8 number of social security benefit recipients in the
9 medically needy category.
10

In addition, it is inappropriate for equal

11 protection analysis to compare aged, blind and disabled
12 individuals whose income is greater than the cash
13 assistance levels, but whose income net of medical
14 expenses is less than the cash assistance levels, with
15 the group of aged, blind and disabled individuals whose
16 gross income is less than the cash assistance levels

17 because Congress simply did not create that
18 classification.

19

The consequences of adopting the district

20 court’s analysis and appellees’ contentions in this case
21 are quite far reaching.

If, as the district court held,

22 for purposes of equal protection analysis the income of
23 the medically need net of medical expenses must be
24 compared with the gross income of the categorically
25 needy, there is no constitutional distinction between
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 the two groups.
2

In fact, there is no difference at all.

QUESTION;

How was the district court able to

3 compare the two incomes?

Did he have statistics before

4 him that would have related to all of the -- the income
5 of all of the medically needy?
6

MR. JONES;

7 have such data.
8

No.

As far as I know, he did not

He had the named plaintiffs —

QUESTION;

Well, doesn't he recognize the fact

9 that Congress is entitled to make general
10 classifications in this field, and that you don't just
11

single out a few basket cases, so to speak, to prove a

12 point?
13

MR. JONES;

I would have thought so, but

14 apparently not because the district court explicitly
15 rejected our contention that the time for comparing the
16 two groups is before medical expenses are incurred.

And

17 if that is true, Fullington v. Shea was wrongly decided
18 and must be overruled;
19 Act,

two. Section 1902(a)(10) of the

which distinguishes between the categorically needy

20 and the medically needy by reguiring the states to cover
21 one but not the other -- or, requiring the states to
22 cover the categorically needy but not the medically
23 needy, is unconstitutional.
24 most importantly,

And finally and perhaps

the 20 jurisdictions that now provide

25 Medicaid benefits for the categorically needy but do not

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

provide any benefits at all for the medically needy must

2 either extend coverage to the medically needy or simply

3 drop out of the program altogether.
4

The district court seemed to be completely

5 oblivious to those consequences, and we think, they are
6 — they simply underscore the error in his decision

and

7 the error in his analysis.
Contrary to the premise of the district

8

9 court’s opinion also, there is no basis at all in the
10 legislative
11

history of this provision for concluding

that the difference in treatment of the categorically

12 needy and the medically needy was the result of some

13 sort of legislative accident.

On its face, the statute

14 distinguishes between those people who are eligible for
15 cash assistance and those people who are not.

The

16 statute only applies to the medically needy.
The distinction drawn between the medically

17

18 needy and the categorically needy was described on the
19 floor of

the Senate and described in the conference

20 report, it is the 67 amendments.
21

The information before

Congress plainly indicated that in many states, the 133

22 3/3 percent of the AFDC amount was going to be less than
23 the old age

assistance income limits.

24 Secretary of Health,
25 and

Indeed, the Under

Education and Welfare, now Health

Human Services, specifically pointed out that 133
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

1/3 percent of the AFDC payment amount, in some states.

2 was even lower than the AFDC standard of need.

Although no one disputed the goal of saving

3

4 money, the provision that was ultimately adopted as
5 Section

1903(f) of the Act was repeatedly criticized on

6 the basis that it was too low.
7 the provision would
8 indigence in the

Congressmen claimed that

destroy the concept of medical

Medicaid statute.

It is unlikely in these circumstances that the

9

10 congressmen — that the entire Congress,
11

as appellees

contend, ignored or overlooked the significance of the

12 data indicating the effect of adopting this

13 percent limitation.

133 1/3

In our view, it is far more likely

14 that the few people in Congress regarded

the difference

15 in treatment as — difference in treatment of the
16 medically needy and

the categorically needy — to be as

17 offensive as appellees seem

to think they should have.

18 Indeed, Senator Javits expressly argued or made several
19 policy arguments against discriminating against the
20 medically needy.
21

The Senate -- Senator Javits's arguments were

22 made in support of the Kuchel Amendment.

The Senate, by

23 a vote of more than — by a margin of more than two to
24 one,

rejected those policy arguments and enacted the

25 Senate Bill

as the committee had proposed, with the
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

expression provision that discriminated against the

2 medically needy.

That is a different provision than the

3 one that is at issue here,
4 provision here, and

but it was replaced by the

it seems to us that the vote in the

5 Senate on the Kuchel Amendment plainly indicates that at
6 least those members
7 did

of the Senate who voted on that bill

not regard discrimination against the medically

8 needy, or a difference in treatment of the medically
9 needy and the categorically needy

as something so

10 offensive that it could never be tolerated.

If there are no questions, I would like to

11

12 reserve the balance of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. SIMON, ESQ.

14

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

15

MR. SIMON;

16

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17 please the Court;

The issue before the Court is whether Congress

18

19 has required

a state Medicaid program to apply a lower

20 subsistence standard to a group of indigent, aged and
21 disabled people who do not depend on public assistance,
22 lower than it applies to public assistance recipients.
23 And

if so, whether it is constitutional for Congress to

24 do so.
25

Now let me begin by responding to the question
18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which Justice Rehnquist raised.

We do not challenge the

2 ability of a state to determine eligiblity on the basis
3

of gross income.

We do not challenge the ability of

4

Congress or a state to draw eligibility conditions on

5

the basis of broad, general characteristics.

6 is not the way this program worked.
7

The classification

involved in this program is not a broad, general,

8 overbroad characteristic.
9

But that

Massachusetts makes a precise

determination of the impact of medical expenses on

10

financial need.

11

appellee class who are identically situation to SSI

It does identify those members of the

12 recipients by considering the additional factor of
13

medical expenses.
This case is thus radically unlike the cases

14
15

such as Fullington, for instance, or Weinberger vs.

16

Salfi where the cases upheld over-broad classifications

17

on the grounds of administrative convenience of

18

administrative simplicity on the theory that a state

19

need not consider every factor bearing on need.

20

program has no obligation to identify all the people who

QUESTION*

Mr. Simon, is it necessary, in your

24

constitutional argument, as I took it to be from the

25

district court's opinion, that the federal level be
19

1

compared with the Massachusetts level?

2

MR. SIMON:

It is necessary -- both levels

3 that apply here, Your Honor, are Massachusetts levels.
4 Massachusetts sets the SSI level and it sets the
5 medically needy level, although the medically level is
6 at the 4/3 cap.

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

Because of the federal

8 statute.

9
10

MR. SIMON:
QUESTION;

That is correct. Your Honor.
Then would the district court's

11 holding mean that the federal statute could not be
12 constitutionally applied in Massachusetts,

but that it

13 could be in other states?
14

MR. SIMON:

It could be applied in any state

15 which had a medically needy program in which the 4/3
16 maximum was above the SSI level.

That is true in the

17 majority of medically needy states.
18

QUESTION:

So that a law of Congress is held

21

22 Honor.

under his ruling.
MR. SIMON:

Well, that is correct, Your

But it is important to focus on the reason.

The

23 reason is, of course, that Congress cannot authorize,
24 through the use of its fiscal power, a state to do
25 something which Congress could not do itself.

I do not

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

if Congress itself had

think there is the same rule

2 applied two separate, radically different standards of
3

needs to two identically situated classes, there would

4

beno doubt that that would be a violation of equal

5

protection.
Here Congress is using its fiscal power to

6
7

force some states to set its — to treat one class

8 differently in a way that Congress could not, itself.

Now, I would like to return to the statutory

9
10

argument.

As it turns out, the statutory argument and

11

the constitutional arguments are closely intwined.

12

I think it is important to emphasize to the Court the

13

nature of the classification that is at stake here.

And

As Mr. Jones concedes, Massachusetts covers

14
15

two groups of indigent, aged and disabled people who are

16

identically situated in terms of the same categorical

17

criteria of age and disability.
QUESTION:

18
19

that one group was all indigents.
MR. SIMON;

20
21

24
25

That is the case, Your Honor, if

indigents is measured as that program measures indigents

22 and
23

But I did not understand him to say

—
QUESTION;

Yes, but the statutory

classification is much broader than indigents.
MR. SIMON;

I am not sure which statutory
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

classification Your Honor is referring to.

2

QUESTION*

3

MR. SIMON*

Those, the medically needy.
No, that is not correct, Your

4

Honor.

5

feature of the medically needy program is that income

If the medically needy — the distinctive

6 must be determined on the basis of income -- gross
7

income after medical expenses.

8 works is this*
9

That is, the way it

to the extent that the individual has

income in excess of the eligibility standards, the state

10

then considers the individual’s medical expenses.

11

the extent that the individual's medical expenses reduce

12

his income below the public assistance standard or the

13

medically needy standard, the individual is then

14

entitled to Medicaid for medical expenses, for which any

15

remaining excess income is insufficient.

16

spends the excess income for his or her own medical

17

expenses, receives Medicaid for only those remaining

18

expenses.

19

To

The individual

Now, the effect of that, if the medically

20 needy standards were set at the same level as the SSI
21

standard, would be to precisely equalize the treatment

22 of these two groups of aged and disabled people.
23

QUESTION*

I suppose your class actually is

24

one that fluctuates in membership.

At any given point

25

in time a person may be rather wealthy, but if he
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

suddenly has a lot of medical expenses, then he becomes

2 a member of the class.

3

MR. SIMON:

4 Your Honor.

That is unlikely to be the case,

All members of the class are aged and

5 disabled, and certainly, the two named plaintiffs have a
6 permanent continuing medical need, and in view of the

7 types of expenditures for which Medicaid tends to pay,
8 makes it also seem

unlikely.

For instance,

70% of

9 Medicaid expenditures are for nursing home care, which
10 tends to be a very long-term affair.

In any event, it is also the case that the

11
12 class of

SSI recipients fluctuates, too, and there is no

13 reason to believe that this class fluctuates anymore
14 radically than the class of SSI recipients.
15

I should also point out that in order to

16 qualify as medically needy, the applicant must satisfy
17 an asset requirement which in this case would be $2000.
18 So there are no millionaires getting —

just for the categorically needy and had no provision

25

No, we do not challenge that at

We think Congress —

QUESTION:

That is one thing that always
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 troubled me about your position.
2

MR. SIMON*

Well, Your Honor, I think that the

3 position in fact is quite typical of the situation in
4 most of the welfare cases this Court has considered in
5 the equal protection context.

It is always the case

6 that welfare benefits are optional.

On the other hand,

7 all of this Court's cases stand for the proposition that
8 once a court undertakes to provide benefits, it assumes
9 minimal obligations of rationality in distributing them.
10

QUESTION*

11 or a legislature.

Well, you mean once Congress does,
My assumption is that Congress

12 decides to give Medicaid benefits to the categorically
13 needy, period.

Now, does he have an obligation to give

14 medical benefits to people who, because of their medical
15 expenses, are equally needy?
16
17

MR. SIMON*
on why.

No, but it is important to focus

The reason why is that Congress and the states

18 have a right to determine eligibility on the basis of
19

general criteria.

They do not have to consider every

20 factor bearing on need.
21

When the state chooses to

determine eligibility on the basis of gross income

22 alone, there is a state interest in simplicity and
23

convenience; there is also at least a formal equality in

24

the way people are measured.

25

In this instance, however, Congress has given
2U

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE

SW

WASHINGTON D O 50094 (909^ SS4-9345

1 Massachusetts its option and Massachusetts has accepted
2 it, to consider an additional factor to make it a more
3 precise determination.

And when Massachusetts does

4 that, we submit, it cannot apply a different standard of
5 non-medical need to an identically-situated group of
6 aged and disabled people.
7

Now, the relevance of the legislative history

8 to both the statutory and the equal protection arguments
9 is that the entire purpose of Congress in creating the
10 medically needy option was precisely to enable the
11 states to avoid the unfairness which results when aged
12 and disabled people who cannot receive welfare are left
13 with less income for their non-medical needs than they
14 would receive if they could qualify for welfare.
15

Virtually identical language in both the House

16 and the Senate reports on the original 1965 legislation
17 indicates that Congress* entire purpose in doing this
18 was precisely to avoid the unfairness that is involved
19 in

this situation.

Congress proposed to do this through

20 the two distinctive features of medically needy
21 coverage.

The first is the net income principle; the

22 second is the comparability principle, which now appears
23 in

the statute in Section 1902(a)(17), and which was

24 enacted in

1965 for the precise purpose of prohibiting a

25 state from setting its medically needy standards below
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 12021 554-2345

QUESTION;

When was Section 1903(f) enacted?
In 1967, Your Honor.
Why are you focus — isn't that the

5 one that the district court declared unconstitutional?
6

MR. SIMON:

That is correct. Your Honor.

7

QUESTION;

Why are you focusing, then, on 1965

8

MR. SIMON:

Because 1902(a)(17) is still in

9 the statute, Your Honor, and the question is whether the
10 1967 amendment amended that requirement.
11

QUESTION:

Oh, it is a question of statutory

12 construction.'
13

MR. SIMON:

Yes, Your Honor.

14

Let me just draw the Court's attention to two

15 sentences from the much longer statement in the 1965
16 legislative gloss on the comparability provision.

Such action would reduce the

22 individual below the level determined by the state as
23 necessary for his maintenance."
24

I do not believe there can be any reasonable

25 dispute that the 1965

legislation was intended to
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

prohibit what has happened in this case.

The question

2

then arises whether Congress intended when it enacted

3 the 4/3 cap in 1967 to alter that commitment to
4 comparability.

No, we did not.

The district

14

QUESTION*

I suppose you are going to reach

15 the positions of the United States and -- in their
16 answer to your statutory argument.
17

MR. SIMON;

Indeed, I am. Your Honor.

18

The legislative history of the 1967 amendment

19 — that is, the 4/3 cap — which the Secretary asserts
20 to require the discrimination alleged here,
21 Congress did not intend

shows that

that the 4/3 cap required the

22 medically need standards to be lowered below the

23 categorically needy standards.

Congress did intend to

24 lower the medically needy standards; it did not
25 contemplate that they would be lowered below the
28

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

categorically needy standards, and thus abrogate the

2 specific commitment to equity between public assistance
3 recipients and the retired working corps which Congress
4 made in the comparability provision.

The legislative history of the 4/3 rule in

5
6

1967 shows that Congress was reacting to the New York

7 program.

That program had set its medically standard so

8 high that nearly 40 to 45 percent of the entire state
9 had been made eligible, even before consideration of
10 medical expenses.
11

Congress thought that New York had

abused the program to make its benefits available to

12 people whom Congress had never thought would benefit

13 from
14

the program, and imposed the 4/3 rule as a cap.
The sponsors of the 4/3 rule repeatedly

15 characterized its purpose as simply to bring the New
16 York program into line with
17 expectations.

Congress' original

As one of the sponsors put it, none of

18 the basic purposes of Title

19 have been harmed or

19 injured in any way.
20
21

The 1967 legislation made no amendment to the
comparability requirement which was specifically enacted

22 to pevent medically needy income standards from being
23 set below the corresponding categorical standards.

And

24 the legislation shows that if Congress had intended to
25 alter that comparability standard, it would have done

29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

so.

In fact, in 1967, Congress did enact a provision

2 which was intended to make a minor codification in the

3 related comparability provision, also known as a
4 comparability provision.
5

And in that instance. Congress made a separate

6 and specific amendment to that comparability provision

7 which appeared in the 1967 legislation under the heading
8 "Modification of Comparability

Provisions."

Not a word

9 was said under that heading about any modification
10 intended in the comparability provision requiring
11

medically needy standards at least as high as

12 categorically needy standards.

Nor was anything said in

13 the debates or hearings that suggested any understanding
14 that this result would occur.
15

And again, had there been any such

16 understanding, the record indicates that there would
17 have been such discussion.

The one statutory amendment

18 Congress did consider in 1967 which was identified as
19 discriminating against the medically needy was severely
20 criticized for doing so and was eliminated from the
21

legislation as enacted.

The statement from Senator

22 Long, which Mr. Jones quoted does not refer at all to

23 the 4/3 rule, but refers to a separate provision that
24 was considered in the Senate that had nothing to do with
25 income eligibility limitations and did discriminate

against the medically needy and was eliminated from the

2 statute.
3
4

Now, Mr. Jones emphasizes there were states in
1967 in which the 4/3 maximum was below the old age

5 standards.

To be specific,

there were six states with

6 medically needy programs, six out of 22, although in
7 only three of them was the difference at all substantial.
8

The important fact is that this conclusion is

9 derived from a very elaborate and, we concede, ingenius
10 analysis Mr. Jones has performed.

It was not an

11 analysis that was performed by an legislator in 1967.
12

The only medically needy program Congress

13 discussed in anymore than a passing fashion in 1967 was
14 the New York program, and in New York, the 4/3 maximum
15 was well above the old age assistance levels, there was
16 no danger that the result in this case would occur in
17 New York.
18

19 Congress to

It would have been so easy for

20 categorically needy — it did not say that.
21

MR. SIMONs

It did not say that, Your Honor.

22 On the other hand, unless the comparability rule is
23 still in place, it is possible that Congress assumed

the

24 comparability rule would control in this case, it is
25 possible that the legislature simply

never contemplated

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

that there would be as large a gap between the AFDC and

Ordinarily, it is the most

17 recently-enacted -18

MR. SIMON:

Well, I would dispute, Your Honor,

19 that the Court has followed that rule in cases that
20 involve very similar situations.

In cases such as Cass

21 versus United States, for instance,

and the cases that

22 we cite on page 30 and 31 of our brief, the court, as

23 here, has been faced with a situation in which the
24 literal application of a later statute would require the
25 abrogation of a basic policy commitment reflected in

that earlier statute or earlier legislative history.
In those situations, the Court has looked to

3 the legislative history of both statutes, and where it
4 has found in the legislative history of the later
5 statute no intention to alter the prior policy, it has
6 held the earlier statute governing.

7 applies here.

Comparability was a fundamental

8 commitment of the 1965 legislation.

QUESTION;

If we sustain the statutory

10 argument, it would only cure these cases where the level

HR. SIMON;

That is the only program that we

13 are seeking to have the Court cure.

Your Honor.

We do

14 not dispute at all that Congress has a right to set a
15 cap on medically needy income levels, and in the
16 majority of states in which the cap would set the levels
17 above the old age assistance standards or the SSI
18 standards, we don't see any objection —

MR. SIMON;

The impact of the district court's

25 decision will be, all parties agree, to require that the
33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

medically needy standards be set at no lower than the

2 SSI standards; it would be exactly identical to what the

3 comparability rule requires.
4

The effect of the Secretary's interpretation

5 of the income maximum is, first of all, it would abridge
6 the fundamental commitment Congress made to

7 comparability in 1965.

It is also to violate the basic

8 equities that are expressed throughout the statute,

9 particularly in Title II, by penalizing work and social
10 security contributions in savings,

for that is the only

11

difference,

the only significant difference between the

12

two classes in this situation — is that the members of

13 the disfavored class have worked more, saved more, or
14 made more social security contributions and now find
15 themselves in a situation where the income they have
16 worked for is turning into a liability that forces them
17 to live nearly $200 below the subsistence income that
18 Massachusetts provides SSI recipients.
19

We submit that the Court should not impute an

20 intention to accomplish this result to Congress without
21 more evidence that Congress intended it than can

be

22 found in this record.

23

Now, Mr. Jones, -- let me turn now to the

24 constitutional argument.

We submit that if the Court

25 does decide that the Secretary's interpretation of the
34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
Ann VIRGINIA A VP

SW

WASHINGTON DC. 20024

202\ 554-2345

(

1

statute is right, then the district court's analysis is

2 entirely sound.

That analysis — that issue turns on

3 the question of whether there is any distinction in the
4 situation of the two classes which is rationally related
5 to a legitimate legislative purpose.
6

He submit that there is no such distinction.

7 Now, Mr. Jones refers — Mr. Jones mentions the purpose
8 of saving money.

That, of course, as this Court has

9 held, is not a sufficient basis for a distinction which
10

irrationally burdens — puts the burden of public

11

savings disproportionately on one class and not on

12

another identically-situated class.

The issue was

13 specifically held in Rinaldi vs. Yeager, is whether the
14 specific classifying feature rationally determines who
15 is to bear the burden of public savings.

Now, Mr. Jones suggests that it is possible

17 that the medically needy have greater access to private
18 insurance than the categorically needy.

There

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

was certainly no reason to conclude that Congress could

QUESTION:

3
4

I don’t know whether they could,

but could anybody draw that inference?
HR. SIMON:

5

I understand your question, Your

6 Honor, and let me try to answer it.
7

First of all, there

is no reason to think that the medically needy have any

8 better ability to purchase private insurance.

They do

9

have more gross income but whatever advantage gross

10

income gives them in getting insurance is precisely

11

offset by the fact that they have medical expenses.

12

Medical expenses are equally relevant as income to the

13

ability to purchase insurance.
QUESTION:

14

Well, I don’t know — an awful lot

15

of people spend an awful lot less for medical insurance

16

than the elderly end up paying for doctors’ bills, which

17

are paid by their insurance company.
MR. SIMON:

that an awful lot of the aged and disabled do so, and

MR. SIMON:

Is it rationale to

think that a medically needy person with a higher gross
36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

income has greater access to medical insurance that

2 might pay his very large medical bills?

MR. SIMON i

3

Well, we would submit that it is

4 not rational, Your Honor.

There is no basis, either in

5 a priori logic or in any data.
6 to the contrary.

Indeed, the data suggest

In 1965, Congress considered data on

7 the availability of insurance to the aged and disabled
8 — to the aged, and concluded that such insurance that
9 was so available was so ineffective that it displaced
10

the principal coverage that was then available with Part

11

A of Medicare.

Since that time there has been no

policy in favor of — encouraging the purchase

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM H. SIMON, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES - Resumed

6

MR. SIMON i

7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court;

I would like to return to the issue of

9
10 assuming

that a hypothetical rational basis is

11 sufficient to sustain the classification of whether the
12 private insurance argument is a sufficient rational
13 basis,

of course.

Of course, amicus have argued in

14 their brief

that a hypothetical rational basis is not

15 sufficient,

at least under minimum rationality, but for

16 the purposes of Justice White's question
17 Justice's question,

and the Chief

I want to assume that it is

18 sufficient.

QUESTION ;

19

20 that?
21

Well, what is your position on

May we consider some rational basis that you do

not see in the legislative history, or anything else?

22 Can't we imagine one?
23

MR. SIMON;

24 that in the case of

Well, we would submit, Your Honor,
a classification which results from

25 legislative inadvertence that is not supported

by an

38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

actual legislative judgment, that a higher standard than

2 minimum rationale be applied.

QUESTION;

3

Yes, well, you have not any

4 authority for that.

MR. SIMON:

5

Well, four members of this Court

6 at least have subscribed —

QUESTION;

7

Well, you haven’t any authority in

8 this Court for that, I don’t think.

MR. SIMON:

9

QUESTION;

10
11

That is correct, Your Honor —
As a matter of fact, you have got

authority from this Court directly to the contrary.

12

MR. SIMON:

No, I understand that, Your Honor,

13 and for that reason I want to raise the question of
14 whether, in fact, there is a sufficient hypothetical
15 basis —
16

QUESTION;

How can you say this classification

17 results from legislative inadvertence when Congress
18 enacted the law?
19

I mean, they -- it is an enrolled bill.

MR. SIMON;

Well again, Justice Rehnquist,

20 Congress enacted two laws.

They are in inconsistent.

21 There is no — the legislative history indicates that

22 Congress did not intend that the second statute abridge
23 the fundamental policy.
24

QUESTION:

Then that is really a statutory

25 construction, isn’t it, as to -- the one you were making

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

before lunch as to which should be applied.

2

MR. SIMON:

That is correct. Your Honor.

3 There is a statutory construction argument.

On the

4 other hand, the legislative history does have bearing
5 under the analysis in, for instance, Schweiker versus
6 Wilson, because the first place one looks when one
7 cannot infer a rational basis from the language of the
8 statute, is to the legislative history to see if
9 Congress, in fact, made an explicit judgment that some
10 purpose would be rationally served by the classification.
11

We submit in this case that Congress made no

12 such judgment in this judgment here.

The next question,

13 of course, is whether the government can hypothesize a
14 rational bo sis.
15

We would submit that a hypothetical rational

16 basis of the sort that the government hypothesized would
17 have to meet at least two conditions to be sufficient.

18 First, it would have to have some consistency with the
19 statutory framework.

So much is implied in the

20 requirement of rationality.
21

Second, it would have to be

supported either by some judicially-noticeable data, or

22 at least by some a priori common sense plausibility.
23

We submit that on reflection, the private

24 insurance argument
25 First,

satisfies neither of these criteria.

with respect to statutory framework, the private
40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Ann uioniNiA av/p q \a/ WAQuiwnmw nr onnoA for\o\ «sa-oqas

1

insurance argument is not only unsupported by any actual

2 legislative judgment that the appellees have better

3 access to insurance, or that encouraging to purchase
4 insurance would reduce Medicaid costs; it is, in fact,
5 contrary to the premises which Congress acted on when it
6 created the medically needy program, which

are precisely

7 that people who have less income after medical expenses
8 than welfare recipients are identically situated to

9 welfare recipients and should be treated as identically
10 situated to welfare recipients.
11

Now, with respect to judicially noticeable

12 data, the only such data about private insurance that

13 has been cited to the Court is the data we cite on pages
14 44 through 46 of our brief.

That data consists of the

15 data which Congress considered in 1965 with respect to
16 the availability of private insurance to the aged when
17 it enacted the Medicare program, and some more recent
18 data, published data, which is entirely consistent with
19 that data which we have cited to the court.
20
21

That data indicates two things.

First, it

indicates that there is no private insurance available

22 to the aged which covers the majority of services for

23 which Medicaid expenditure are made.

70%

of Medicaid

24 expenditures are made for private insurance -- excuse
25 me, are made for nursing home care.

Virtually no

41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

private insurance covers the type of nursing home care

2 for which Medicaid expenditures on behalf of the aged

3 are made.
4

Second, the data indicates that where private

5 insurance does cover expenses that Medicaid does cover,
6 it does so at greater cost than Medicaid does because of

7 the expenses of sales effort, advertising and profit
8 which often exceed

80% of the total cost of the

9 insurance.
Now, I would submit that there are two

10
11

rational conclusions that one can draw from this data,

12 and

that there are no rational conclusions that one can

13 draw from it which sustain the classification.

First,

14 the first conclusion that the data suggests is that the
15 principal incentive effect of the discrimination in this
16 case on people who fear ending up in the situation of
17 the appellees, is not to encourage the purchase of
18 private insurance but to encourage them to make efforts
19 to reduce post-retirement income so that they can
20 qualify for SSI,
21

by working less, saving less or by

investing their income in exempt assets such as their

22 home or burial plots, which are exempt under Medicaid

23 and SSI.
24

Secondly,

I would submit that the most

25 plausible conclusion from this data is that even if the
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202^ 554-2345

1

discrimination does encourage people who fear ending up

2 in the situation of Mr.

Hunter and Mr. Hogan to purchase

3 private insurance, that their purchase of private
4 insurance would increase, rather than reduce, the cost
5 of the Medicaid program.
That is true for this reasons

6

explicitly

7 under the statute under Section 1902(a)(17), and under
8 all the regulations,

the Medicaid program must credit

9 the cost of the premiums against surplus income in
10 determining eligibility of the applicant.
11

The effect of

that is that the Medicaid program, in effect, pays for

12 the insurance because by crediting the premiums,

it in

13 effect reduces the amount of expenses which the
14 applicant would otherwise have to make for his own
15 medical expenses and increases the amount that the state
16 must pay.

If the insurance is a bad buy for the

17 applicant, it is a bad buy for the Medicaid program and
18 it will increase Medicaid costs.
Now, of course, if Congress had made a

19

20 contrary determination,

21

defer to it.

22 issue.

we would expect this Court to

But Congress has not considered the

We submit that the only rational course when all

23 of the data before the court completely contradicts the
24 hypothetical premise of the government, is that this is
25 not a rational basis.
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, if I may I would like to just briefly

2 return to the issue that I think Justice Stevens

3 originally raised, which is the question of is there a
4 difference in the extent to which the income of the two
5 classes fluctuates.

When I answered that question I

6 should have pointed out that the accounting period for

7 Medicaid eligibility is six months.

That is, in order

8 to qualify for medically needy coverage, an applicant

9 must demonstrate that his or her medical expenses will
10 exceed the amount of his or her surplus income for at
11 least six successive months.

12

Now, both of the named appellees have, in

13 fact, permanent conditions and indeed, it is probable
14 that the vast majority of the class have conditions that
15 go on for much longer than six months, and of course,
16 they must re-establish eligibility every six months.
17

By contrast, the accounting period for SSI is

18 from one to three months, so that one can establish
19 eligibility for SSI if one has income, under those
20 standards, for a single month; at most three months,
21 depending on when in the quarter one applies.

So that

22 insofar as one can determine from the statute, the

23 income of SSI recipients is more likely to fluctuate
24 than the income of the medically needy.
25

Now I must say something to respond to an
44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

argument which Mr. Jones makes in the reply brief which

2 he has not yet made here today, but since he may yet
3

make it, I want to anticipate it.

If I understand Mr.

4

Jones' reply brief correctly, he denies that there is

5

any such thing as an income comparability requirement in

6 the statute which requires comparability between
7

8

medically needy and categorically needy classes.
If that is his position — and I may

9

misunderstand him — it is an astonishing position, and

10

it is contrary to Congress' clear understanding and the

11

clear understanding of the federal courts.

12

wanted to draw the Court's attention to a sentence from

13

the conferees' report on the 1981 Medicaid amendments

14

which appears at three places in the Congressional

15

Record and cited on page 14 of our brief.

16

is not the intent of the Conferees to alter the

17

requirements under Section 1902(a)(17) of the Social

18

Security Act relating to comparable treatment of income

19

and resources between categorically needy and medically

QUESTION;

How long after the event did

22 Congress say what you have just read?
23

MR. SIMON:

24

QUESTION;

25

MR. SIMON:

This was made —
You said 1981?
This is 1981, Your Honor, that is
45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 correct.

On the other hand, the federal courts in the

2 numerous cases we cite on page 13 of our brief, -- and
3 before today I would have said the Secretary himself —
4 have always interpreted the comparability -- well, my
5 time is up.
6

Thank you, Your Honor.

QUESTION*

Well, let me ask you, do you think

7 this subsequent legislative history is pretty good
8 evidence as to what the prior law meant?
9

MB. SIMON*

I think it is pretty good evidence

10 that the comparability requirement requires
11

comparability of income standards —

12

QUESTION;

Well, at the same time, Congress

13 did change the impact of this difference to some extent,
14 didn *t they?
15

MR. SIMON;

No, Your Honor, it did not.

There

16 was -- and the legislation is somewhat confusing because
17 there were numerous requirements known as comparability
18 requirements.
19 required

that the aged and disabled be treated the same

20 as families.
21

22

There was a set of requirements which

That is the so-called horizontal

comparability requirement which was eliminated in 1981.
QUESTION;

23 legislating

Do you think -- they were

in this area at the time, in the

24 comparability area.
25

MR. SIMON;

Well, Your Honor, I would say that

2

the purport of the sentence I read -QUESTION;

Well, they must have been -- do you

3 think Congress by that time was aware of this
4 distinction that you are now attacking?
5

NR. SIMON;

No, Your Honor, it appears, at

6 least the most recent evidence that bears directly on
7 that indicates the contrary.

In 1980, Congress did

8 address an importantly related problem and left the
9 record indicating that either it is not aware of the
10 problem or it understands comparability to preclude
11 medically needy levels below the 4/3 rule.
12

QUESTION;

So you get flatly contrary

13 indications from this later legislative history on the
14 question before us now than does the Solicitor General.
15

MR. SIMON;

The legis — we acknowledge the

16 subsequent legislative history is contradictory and
17 inconclusive.

On the other hand, it is clear that since

18 1965 not a single legislator has expressed any intention
19 to abrogate

20

the comparability requirement.

QUESTION;

Well, the other — your opposition

21 says that this later legislative history indicates
22 congressional awareness and the determination to leave
23 this discrimination in
24

MR. SIMON;

place.
Well, the only legislative history

25 that remotely — first of all, I should say that the
47

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

1980 legislation clearly indicates Congress is not aware

2 of it, or that it understands that comparability
3 controls here.

That was the 1980 amendment to the

4 Veterans Benefit Act, which explicitly was made not
5 applicable in medically needy states on the explicity
6 premise that in medically needy states a person, after
7 losing categorically needy eligibility, could be treated
8 no worse as a medically needy person.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. JONES, ESQ.

12

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS - Rebuttal

13

MR. JONES:

Appellees state that the district

14 court indicated that it was inclined to rule on the
15 constitutional argument as an explanation for their
16 failure to raise the statutory argument in the district
17 court.
18

The complaint filed in this case does not

19 raise the statutory argument, and focuses solely on the
20 constitutional argument.

In fact, count one of the

21 complaint states, the statutory 4/3 limit on
22 reimbursement

requires this.

1

you don’t raise any statutory construction argument, but

2 I have read the statute and I think, there is a very good
3

one.

Now, you can't make me reach a constitutional

4

issue just by your desire not to raise the statutory

5

issue.

You would not have thought the judge was making

6 an error, would you?
7

MR. JONES:

If the judge had done that, I

8 would probably agree.
9
10
11

12
13

QUESTION:

Well, there are some other judges

involved now.
MR. JONES:

But this is an appellate court and

not a trial court, and —
QUESTION:

You mean you can make us reach us

14

the constitutional issue if we don’t — if there is a

15

perfectly legitimate statutory issue to be disposed of

16

you say we must ignore it?

17

MR. JONES:

Well, I don't think you can decide

18

it without giving us an opportunity to respond to it.

19

Our only opportunity to —

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Well, you have filed a whole reply

brief on it.
MR. JONES:

A whole reply brief -- but we have

23

not had an opportunity to litigate this issue in the

24

lower courts, and we have not had an opportunity to

25

expand on the argument.

We think our reply brief is
49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

perfectly adequate to demonstrate the insubstantiality

2 of the statutory argument.
3

But I suggest that this Court should not reach

4 that issue,

or should ignore that issue, and if it does

5 it should reject it.
6

QUESTION;

Or if we reach it, you would say at

7 least we ought to vacate the judgment of the district

8 court and remand it so that you can litigate the
9 statutory issue?
10

HR. JONES;

Or remand it and give the

11 appellees an opportunity to amend their complaint to
12 raise it.
13

QUESTION;

14

HR. JONES;

Well, it is raised now.
Well, the complaint frames the

15 issues in litigation as a general matter, and the
16 complaint in this case excludes the statutory issue.
17 And furthermore,

the arguments in the district court

18 presumed or assumed

that a statutory issue was a

19 non-issue.
20

The statutory argument that appellees raise

21 now is simply an attempt to win in this court a battle
22 that they have already lost in Congress.
23 rely on a statement in the

Appellees now

1981 legislative history, but

24 in our brief we quote from the

1972 provision that the

25 Senate adopted, that would have dealt exactly with

MR. JONES*

4

Furthermore, Mr. Justice Stevens, contrary to

5

Okay.

Professor Simon's answer to your question, if the time

6 for comparing the medically needy and the categorically
7

needy is after the medically needy have incurred medical

8 expenses, and what you compare is the income net of
9

medical expenses to the gross income of the

10

categorically needy, there is no difference between the

11

two groups, and all states would be required to adopt

12

medically needy programs if they participate in the

13

Medicaid program.

14

between the two groups other than that.

I mean, there is simply no difference

Moreover, in response to another of your

15
16

questions, Professor Simon indicated that somehow the

17

individuals in this class do not include people with

18

average income, but it clearly does.

19

needy group includes anybody whose income -- or any

The medically

MR. JONES*

Well, his income is the same.

QUESTION:

I am sorry?
If you treat income as income

7

a difference?
MR. JONESs

8

point.

No.

And that is exactly the

If a stats adopts a Medicaid program for the

10

categorically needy, there is no basis for saying that

11

there is any legitimate reason for them not to cover

12

people whose income, net of medical expenses, is less

13

than the income of the categorically needy.
The appellees make an argument about private

14
15

insurance.

They say that Congress could not have

16

intended this.

17

distinguishing between the categorically needy and the

18

medically needy is because the operation of some state

19

plans operated to discourage both the participation in

20

the optional Medicare program, as well as to supplant

21

private insurance.

Congress clearly said the reason it was

The House committee indicated that

22 it clearly did not intend that.
23
24
25

And the Senate

committee agreed.
Now, appellees argue that the benefits
provided by private insurance just would not be
53

ALDERS0N REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

sufficient, or would be worth less than the premiums

2 that the medically needy would have to pay.

That, it

3

seems to me, is something that should be submitted to

4

Congress, but Congress clearly believed that people with

5

gross income in excess of the cash assistance level were

6 better able than the categorically needy to take care of
7

their own medical expenses, either by buying private

8 insurance or some other means.

Throughout this case it has been assumed that

9
10

the spend down level somehow indicates the amount of

11

income that will, in fact, be left for non-medical

12

expenses.

13

the statute simply requires that an individual incur

14

medival expenses of a particular amount.

15

require that he pay medical expenses in the particular

16

period that the state uses.

17

But if the individual pays the

21

Appellees' entire argument depends on the

22 proposition that incurring medical expenses somehow
23

makes them the same as the categorically needy whose

24

gross income is less than the cash assistance income

25

limitations.
