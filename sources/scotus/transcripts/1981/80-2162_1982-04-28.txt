CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We’ll hear arguments

firt this morning in Ramah Navajo School Board v. the

4

Bureau of Revenue of New Mexico.
Mr. Gross, you may proceed whenever you’re

ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. GROSS, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

9
10
11

MR. GROSS*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
The question in this case is whether the State

12

of New Mexico has the legal power to burden an Indian

13

school construction project on the Ramah Navajo Indian

14

Reservation in New Mexico through means of a sales tax

15

which has deprived the Indian School Board involved of

16

more than $232,000 which was granted by Congress for the

17

express purpose of constructing school facilities for

18

Navajo children.

19
20
21

The facts giving rise to this question are
essentially as follows*
In 1968 the State of New Mexico, through its

22

subdivision, the Gallup-McKinely County School District,

23

shut down the only public high school in the vicinity

24

serving the Ramah Navajo community in a remote section

25

of western New Mexico.

By closing the school and

1

failing to provide adequate access to any alternative

2

public school, the state effectively compelled the

3

Navajo high school children from this community to

4

either abandon school at all or attend distant federal

5

Indian boarding schools.
In response, the Navajo community filed a

6
7

lawsuit in state court against the school district to

8

try to force reopening of the school.

9

failed, and in its aftermath, under the authority of the

The lawsuit

10

Navajo Tribe, the Ramah Navajo Chapter created its own

11

school board, the Appellant in this case, the Ramah

12

Savajo School Board, Incorporated, and authorized it to

13

seek funds from the government to open the first Indian

14

school started from scratch in modern times.

15

board succeeded and for five years ran a school under

16

contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs in the

17

abandoned public high school facility in Ramah village.

The school

Meanwhile, the school board approached

18
19

Congress for funds with which to place a permanent

20

school facility on the reservation in the heart of the

21

community.

22

through a series of direct, line item appropriations,

23

the Congress of the United States granted, in effect

24

created a partnership with this remote community to

25

construct a school facility.

The school board again succeeded, and

Now, those funds

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

represented a discrete pool of money, the only funds

2

available for the construction of this school, and were

3

the funds from which the tax in question in this case

4

were drawn.

5

QUESTIONS

Mr. Gross, was it true that in

6

making the funding request, that the amount of the tax

7

was in effect calculated as part of the estimate and

8

that Congress appropriated the money for the payment for

9

the payment of that?

10

HR. GROSS*

Madam Justice O'Connor, the answer

11

is a flat no.

12

word tax does not appear in the legislative history.

13

The architects who prepared construction estimates never

14

referred to the tax, and until —

15
16
17

Congress had no inkling of the tax.

QUESTIONS

The

But their estimates reflect adding

on the amount of the tax?
HR. GROSS*

There is no evidence in the record

18

that it did, and if I may step outside the record for a

19

moment, the answer again is a flat no.

The architects

20 themselves were from out of state and were not familiar
21

with the Hew Mexico tax.

For that reason, all claims

22

having to do with the architects were dropped in an

23

early stage of the trial of this case, and there is no

24

proof in the record about any taxes paid by the

25

architects at all.

QUESTION:

1

2

But didn't the bid itself reflect

the tax?
NR. GROSS:

3

The bid did, and that was the

4

only, or the first occasion at which the school board

5

became aware of the tax.

6

because the New Mexico gross receipts tax operates as a

7

sales tax as this Court held just a few weeks ago in the

8

case of United States v. New Mexico.

9

that — and the evidence in the record, the

It then accepted the burden

That is to say

10

uncontroverted evidence in the record, I might add, on

11

this point is that the construction industry in New

12

Mexico always, universally, passes this tax burden on to

13

consumers of construction services.
QUESTION:

14

What do you suggest is the

15

explanation for including that in the estimates, that

16

they were just playing it safe in case a tax was —
MR. GROSS*

17

Your Honor, at the beginning

18

stages of this construction program, the case law on the

19

subject of taxes imposed indirectly through non-Indians

20

upon Indians on reservations was not as clear as it is

21

today.

22

concerned, the school board included, Lembke

23

Construction Company, simply did not expect or

24

understand or realize that in fact they were not under

25

an obligation to pay this tax.

So one answer. Your Honor, is that all parties

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

Furthermore, the invitation for bids did make

1

2

mention of state sales, use and other taxes.

Now, this

3

is standard language that appears in all AIA form

4

contracts and does not itself specify that the tax must

5

be paid, but in effect means, and has been

6

interpreted — similar language has been interpreted by

7

this Court as meaning you pay the taxes that are

8

required.

9

Well, until this case was filed, the

10

contractor and the Ramah School Board did not understand

11

that they were not obligated to pay the tax.

12

We think that the essential facts underlying

13

the claims made are these.

14

tax is that of a sales tax.

15

fact concedes as much in a public brochure that is

16

appended to our reply brief.

17

as a sales tax on consumers.

18

First, the nature of this

11

that Congress made available.

12

QUESTION*

But Mr. Gross, that is true in any

13 number of situations of public contracts where,
14

supposing this were the federal government rather than

15 the Indian tribe that were building a school and it
16 contracted to have it built in the State of —
17

something, a structure built in the State of New Mexico,

18 and New Mexico applied its gross receipts or sales tax
19

to the private contractor, wouldn’t that be permissible

20 under James v. Dravo and Alabama v. King and Boozer?
MR. GROSS*

21
22

As a matter of fact. Your Honor,

the answer that we would submit to that question is no.

23 When the government —
24

QUESTION*

Don’t you think that's borne out by

25 our cases?

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. GROSS*

I don't believe so because I think

2

in James v. Dravo Contracting Company, in fact as quoted

3

in United States v. New Mexico just a few weeks ago, the

4

Court made mention of the fact that the legal incidence

5

test applied in that case.

6

presumption which can be met and thus invalidate a state

7

tax when a duty of the government is breached by the

8

state tax or the tax interferes substantially with the

9

functioning of government.

10

It only creates a rebuttal

He maintain in this case that both legs of

11

that test have been met if that were the applicable way

12

to look at the case, which we suggest is not.

13

to say, the government, under the Treaty of 1868 with

14

the Navajos, has a duty to provide school facilities.

15

It didn't do so for 100 years at Ramah until the

16

appropriations that we are talking about here.

17

That is

Secondly, because the BIA has a unique and

18

special obligation to Indian tribes, and because this

19

tax has operated as a substantial burden, unlike the

20

tax,, for example, in Central Machinery Company, it has

21

interfered with the functioning of government at Ramah.

22

If I may carry that out just one more step.

23

Your Honor, what we are talking about here is not just

24

the end product, the school, but we are also talking

25

about the contracting process.

Congress, in the Indian

tribes should have the right to run their own

protections of the United States Constitution as much as

11

QUESTION*

12

Hr. Gross, can I interrupt you

right there?
Supposing all the laws and documentation had

13

14 been exactly the same except the government had
15

appropriated an additional $232,000?

What happens to

16 your argument about impairment?
HR. GROSS*

17

Congress has plenary authority

18 over Indian affairs, and if Congress wishes to add
19 monies on for the express purpose of reimbursing the
20

State of New Hexico, that’s constitutional, that’s

21

fine.

22

23

QUESTION*

But had it done that in this case,

just appropriated another $232,000, then there wouldn’t

24 have been the kind of impairment that you describe.
25

MR. GROSS*

Well, if I understand your

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

question correctly, Your Honor, I think what you're

2

saying is couldn't the school board have gone back to

3

Congress and asked for another pot of money with which

4

to pay the tax?

5

special place in the Constitution, they don't control

6

the votes in Congress, and indeed, if I may say so, it

7

seems to me that the special obligations that this Court

8

has recognized repeatedly, at least since Williams v.

9

Lee which says that absent a governing act of Congress

The answer is that while Indians have a

10

states may not burden Indian tribal government, the

11

origin of that rule comes from recognition that Indian

12

tribes cannot ask Congress for certain protections every

13

time they get dollars for a school or dollars for a

14

hospital or dollars for a road.

15

QUESTION*

Well, but what I'm — I'm not sure

16

you're responding to my question.

17

does the constitutional issue turn on whether the amount

18

of money appropriated by the federal government is

19

adequate or inadequate?

20

twice as much money?

21

MR. GROSS*

22
23

My question really is

Supposing they had appropriated

No, it does not turn on that

point. Your Honor.
QUESTIONS

Well, then, I don't really

24

understand your impairment argument, because if they had

25

given you more money, the school could have done

everything that you say you're unable to do, or the

school board could.
MR. GROSS*

3

Your Honor, if I may say so,

4

nobody ever gets enough money to do what he wants to

5

do.

6

at least 4 percent more to do what it wanted to do

7

except for this tax, and that I think is the only answer

8

one can give.

The point is that this school board would have had

If I may turn, Your Honors, to —

9

QUESTION*

10

Well, let me pursue that.

As to

11

the legal, constitutional question here, does it make

12

any difference whether the federal government does or

13

does not include in its grant something for the taxes or

14

whether the architect or the school board or anybody

15

else involved believes or does not believe that the tax

16

is due?

17

whether there is a tax due?

Are those things relevant to the question

MR. GROSS*

18

Mr. Chief Justice, the answer is

19

no.

The practical operation, to use the words of Mr.

20

Justice Rehnquist, apply in the situation.

21

effects, not the parties* understanding, unless they are

22

expressed by Congress, govern the situation.

23

tax represented a substantial burden on Navajo tribal

24

government, as we maintain, then it falls whether or not

25

an extra $232,000 was added on or not.

The tax's

If this

That's the key

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

point.

This tax represented an interference with the

2

most essential, if I may say that, the most essential

3

governmental function of this Indian tribe.

4

main reason why we believe it needs to be invalidated

5

here.

That’s the

6

In the remaining time I have I would just like

7

to address some of the arguments that were raised in the

8

briefs.

9

rule ought to be applied to cases of this sort.

The State’s maintained that the legal incidence
We

10

suggest. Your Honors, that that sort of a rule would

11

first of all be improper for this Court to adopt because

12

Congress, not the Court, has plenary authority over

13

Indian affairs and it is up to Congress to change these

14

softs of rules of long standing.
Number two, the legal incidence rule is simply

15
16

not the case.

We haven’t breached or we are not

17

claiming an exception to the legal incidence rules.

18

It’s simply that the legal incidence rule does not apply

19

or never has been applied to situations involving a

20

triangular relationship between the Congress, an Indian

21

tribe and the states.

22

and evolved from a different set of considerations,

23

considerations that have to do with federal-state

24

comities.

25

federal-state relations do not turn in the straight line

The legal incidence rule arose

For that reason, Your Honor, because

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

situation on questions having to do with obligations to

2

third sovereigns, the legal incidence rule should not be

3 adopted in this case.
4

Finally, Your Honors, there is a panoply of

5 federal law, the Indian Self-Determination Act, to be
6 sure, is the most importtant in our view, but the Navajo
7 Treaty, the disclaimer clause in the New Mexico
8 Constitution, the Buck Act, the Indian trader statutes,
9

they all form a panoply of rules that express Congress*

10 will that Indian tribes exercising powers of government
11

such as this should not be burdened through taxes

12 imposed directly on them, whatever the labels involved.
13

If I may reserve five minutes for rebuttal, I

14 would appreciate it.

Thank you.

AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. CLAIBORNE*

Mr.ChiefJustice,

may it

please the Court*
Without in any way dissenting from what has

23 been said, I hope to look at the case from a somewhat
24 broader perspective, and I would invite the Court to
25 return to the starting point which seems to have been

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

followed in Indian cases since the beginning and to

2

date, that is that presumptively at least within the

3

territory of defined, recognized Indian reservations, of

4

which this is one, state law is off limits except as

5

invited by Congress.

6

the first Trade and Intecourse Acts in which federal,

7

not state, licenses were required to trade with the

8

Indians, in which federal criminal law, not state law,

9

was made applicable within Indian country.

10

11

That has been the pattern since

It was the

rule announced in Worcester v. Georgia —
QUESTION:

Well, we have certainly departed

12

from it a number of times recently, in the Confederated

13

Colville Tribe case.

14

MR. CLAIBORNE:

Justice Rehnquist, certainly

15

there have been exceptions carved to the rule.

16

suggest that the rule, however, as the normal

17

presumptive rule remains alive and well.

18

I

It is not simply a rule that was abandoned

19

after Worcester was decided.

It was the rule, the

20

premise of the Kagama case in which the authority of the

21

United States to promulgate criminal law for Indian

22

country was in part the absence of authority of the

23

state to do so.

24

Congress, including the General Allotment Act.

25

General Allotment Act looked to suggesting the

It is the premise of all legislation of

The

1

reservations to state law, but did so only after

2

allotments were removed from restriction on the

3

presumption that that was a necessary step to the

4

importation of state law.
It is the premise of Public Law 280 which

5

6

would be unnecessary if state law could otherwise enter

7

reservations.

8

transfer to the states this authority.

9

premise of recent cases in this Court dealing with

10

disestablishment and diminishraent of reservations.

11

primary relevance of those decisions is whether or not

12

state law applies within the area; presumptively no if

13

the reservation has neither been disestablished nor

14

diminished.

QUESTION:

To what extent would you say the

24
25

MR. CLAIBORNE*

Justice O'Connor, I would

answer that historically and in this case, the United

States has taken on the obligation of educating Indian

2

and establishing the schools and regulating all aspects

3

of it, including here the very construction of this

4

school with specifically allocated federal monies, and

5

that applying the reasoning of the White Mountain Apache

6

and Pine Top case as well as Central Machinery, we would

7

be entitled to find here too a sufficient federal

8

umbrella to occupy the field and leave no room for state

9

taxation.

10

QUESTION;

Would you say that if the federal

11

government, if the Congress had appropriated a line item

appropriation for the payment of this tax that we could

13

look at that to say that Congress did not intend to

14

preempt it?

15

HR. CLAIBORNE;

It might be possible, Justice

16

O’Connor, though applying the presumption which I

17

suggest is applicable, one ought not read, one ought not

imply congressional consent to state interference in

I think that is so. Justice

15

O’Connor, to the extent that it is not otherwise

16

provided, and of course because the United States has a

17

treaty obligation, because it has in other respects

18

assumed the obligation, the state as a practical matter

19

has here and usually is excused from performing its

20

obligation.

21

What is more, when under the Johnson-0'Malley

22

Act the state does perform the educational function, it

23

is in large measure, if not entirely, reimbursed by

24

federal funds, and in those circumstances it is

25

peculiarly inappropriate for the state to be claiming

19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

the right to tax without having in this instance any of

QUESTION*

But if the state were providing

these services, then they would still not be allowed to

tax, is that right?

8

MR. CLAIBORNE*

Though it is unnecessary to

reach that point here, it is arguable —
QUESTION*

Yes, but of course, it is a concern

9

perhaps in other states.

10

MR. CLAIBORNE*

Justice O’Connor, it may be

11

possible to say that when Congress has invited the state

12

to perform a role in education or in any other field,

13

with the power to regulate that activity, it has

14

impliedly also removed the shield from taxation.

15

where the area is one which the state is not entering by

16

any door of invitation which Congress has provided, it

17

can no more tax than it can regulate that activity which

18

it’s not provided and in which it has no interest except

19

as a source of revenue.

20

QUESTION*

But

Mr. Claiborne, suppose the issue

21

here was a gasoline, state gasoline tax on gasoline used

22

by the contractor, purchased off the reservation, and

23

just hauling materials back and forth from — would that

24

tax fall in the same — it certainly would increase the

25

price to the tribe.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

SR. CLAIBORNE*

1

Justice White, I would not

2

make the same argument with respect to gasoline tax

3

imposed off the reservation with respect to gasoline

4

bought off the reservation any more than I would claim

5

that the Indians themselves were immune from such a tax

6

if they purchased their gasoline off the reservation.
QUESTION*

7

Well, what is this tax?

Suppose

8

the contractor needs X pounds of nails and he goes to

9

the hardware store in Santa Fe and buys X pounds of

10

nails and he has to pay the sales tax?

11

going to use this on the reservation, and therefore I'm

12

exempt?
NR. CLAIBORNE:

13

Does he say I’m

Well, as a practical matter,

14

as I understand it, if the main contractor has a

15

certificate of exemption, he is entitled to purchase his

16

materials tax-free.

17

QUESTION*

les, but what if New Nexico says,

18

look, you're just a contractor: you're building

19

something on a reservation, I’m going to apply our sales

20

tax?

21

We won't give you an exemption?
HR. CLAIBORNE:

Well, our argument goes no

22

further than to claim exemption with respect to a tax

23

which is directly measured and tied to on-reservation

24

activity, not purchases made elsewhere, but the very

25

activity which occurs on the reservation.

1

2

Well, how is this tax — I thought

this was a sales tax.

3

MR. CLAIBORNE*

It is a sales tax.

Well, it's

4

a gross receipts tax because the receipts are paid by

5

the tribe to the contractor on the reservation in

6

respect of the construction which of course necessarily

7

takes place on the reservation.

would not be arguing about that.

MR. UNNA *

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
As we see it, this case boils down to two

5

fundamental issues, and the first is what I call the

6

legal incidence economic burden question, and the second

7

question is the preemption by virtue of the Indian

8

Self-Determination Act allegedly, and the Indian traders

9

license question.

10

On the first issue, that is, the legal

11

incidence economic burden question, as we see it, we

12

have the question given that the legal incidence of the

13

tax is on the non-Indian contractor.

14

additional fact that the economic burden is passed on to

the school board in this case vitiate Hew Mexico's tax,

and here the argument of the school board is, well,

there's a burden being imposed on the school board.

argument is too broad.

22

agricultural taxes in Florida and California.

carry an economic burden that is passed on in the price

QUESTION*

In our economy there are so many

that —

6
7

hidden taxes that it couldn’t conceivably, even with all

8

the defined exemptions, you couldn’t really eliminate

9

all the tax burdens everywhere, could you?

10

NR. UNNA:

No, I agree with you.

11

QUESTION*

Even if you tried to.

12

NR. UNNA*

No, I agree entirely with you.

13

QUESTION*

Computation would be more difficult

14

than it was worth, perhaps, in some cases, wouldn’t it?
NR. UNNA*

15

Perhaps.

The point that I wanted

16

to make in this is that simply because there’s an

17

economic burden being passed on to an Indian group

18

doesn't vitiate a tax.

19

these taxes outside the State of New Mexico in the chain

20

of distribution of goods would fall.

21

argument must be that the only tax allegedly to fall is

22

a visible tax at the end of the line.

23

that that’s a good distinction to make as far as the

24

state's taxing powers, whether it’s a visible tax or

25

hidden.

If that's the rationale, all

QUESTION*

Well, we've got a good many tax

exemptions to churches, for esaraple, among others.

That

3

doesn't mean that all the taxes that are a burden on all

4 of the services and all of the materials, goods that the
5

church may buy can be eliminated, does it?

6

MR. UNNA»

No, it doesn't, not at all.

You exempt the church from real

8

estate taxes, you exempt them from income taxes and a

9 few, but one way or another, churches in the acquisition
10
11

12

of property are going to pay some taxes.
MR. UNNAs

There are all sorts of costs that

are passed on in the consumption of purchase of any

13 goods or services, and New Mexico's tax in this case is
14 simply another economic burden in the chain.

And the

15 legal incidence rule that you have enunciated a month
16 ago in the United States of America v. New Mexico case
17 solves this case as well, and in fact, that what I think
18 has happened is that the Court has been applying the
19 legal incidence rule in the case of Indian groups,
20

Indian tribes.

This is made clear in the Colville case,

21

in the Moe case where there is explicit reference to the

22

legal incidence falling on non-Indian purchasers, and

23 the Court in Footnote 15 in the White Mountain Apache
24 Tribe case stated the fact that the economic burden of
25 the tax falls on the tribe does not by itself mean the

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

tax is preempted as the Moe case makes clear.
The secondary point that I would make about

2

3

the taxes in this case is that in response to your

4

question, Justice O’Connor, that I think it's very clear

5

that in the budget estimates of construction to Congress

6

over the period 1974 to 1979, that in fact one can infer

7

that the gross receipts tax was included in the

8

budgets.

9
10

QOESTIOHi

There is no specific item, is that

MB. OHHAi

There’s no specific line item, and

correct?

11
12

I don’t think there need be one to infer that in fact it

13

was included.

First of all, the architects and

14 engineers who prepared the bid specifications themselves
15 paid about $24,000 in gross receipts tax on their own
16 services.

They apparently- then had a fee of about

17 $600,000, and they paid their tax regularly.

That is an

18 admission at the Joint Appendix page 27.
Those same architects and engineers prepared

19
20

the bid documents.

The bid documents required that New

21

Mexico gross receipts tax be included in the bids of

22

what turned out to be two competing contractors, Lembke

23 as well, and we know that from the testimony of the
24

bidder Lembke’s financial comptroller who testified at

25 the trial.

His testimony is set forth at Joint Appendix

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

58-59# and he says very clearly the bid specifications

2

required the gross receipts tax to be included.

3

all is occurring in 1973 and 1974.

4

So this

We also have the congressional testimony —

5

the trial testimony, excuse me, of the Executive

6

Director of the school board who says they knew from the

7

outset of this project that the gross receipts tax was

8

to be a part of it.

9

QUESTION*

Well, is that — I put that

10

question to your friends before — suppose they not only

11

said that, as you suggested, they believed it.

12

that have anything to do with whether — what the law is

13

on the subject?

22

HR. UNNA*

23

QUESTIONS

That is your view.

MR. UHHA*

The economic burden in fact was

4

passed on in advance in this case.
QUESTIOBs

5

If you were being cautious, since

6

they find they have a lawsuit that comes all the way to

7

this Court, if they are being cautious, good business

8

judgment would dictate that they anticipate every

9

possible contingency, and then if they are not subject

10

to the tax, they are that much better off.
I just can't understand why what the people

11
12

believed or hoped or thought has anything to do with the

13

case.

14

QUESTIQI*

Well, I suppose you might, to the

15

extent the case turns on the Indian Commerce clause and

16

the exclusive authority of the federal government to

17

regulate trade with the Indians, you might argue that

18

Congress accepting the tax item and agreeing to pay it

19

is a consent, is a consent for the state, by — and

20

certainly Congress could if it wanted to expressly

21

consent to the tax.

22

MR. UNNA*

That's the other point we would

23

make as well, that is, that this tax was in effect made

24

known to Congress and Congress approved the construction

25

project here with the gross receipts tax included in the

28

QUESTION;

2

Is there any doubt that if the

would be no doubt about the taxability of the gross

receipts?

7

MB. UNNAx

None whatsoever.

difference we have in this case is that under the Indian

Self-Determination Act of 1975 we have a new entity in

where the legal incidence falls on the non-Indian

contractor but the economic burden is passed on to the

United States, to the BIA, in this instance to the

according to the school board, taxing a religious

use of the product of the service is wrong, that White

Mountain mandates that you look simply at the activity

that the state is taxing and don’t go beyond that and

Well, do you think that if a — a

16

state may not put a sales tax on the sale of goods on a

17

reservation by a non-Indian.

18

MR. UNNA*

By an Indian trader.

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

20

MR. UNNA*

If it's a licensed Indian trader.

21

Warren Trading Post says, you know, the state may not

22

tax that Indian trader directly, I agree.

23

QUESTION:

And is that because of preemption?

24

MR. UNNA*

Preemption by virtue of the Indian

25

traders licensing statutes.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL P. GROSS, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL

6

MR. GROSS:

If I may, Your Honor.

7

There are two threads to ray learned

8

colleague's argument, neither of which we believe has

9

any merit.

First, New Mexico’s argument turns on two

10

fictions.

11

history of gross receipts taxes such as New Mexico's

12

shows that it was intended to be placed by label upon

13

contractors rather than on instrumentalities of the

14

federal government so as to avoid the McCullough v.

15

Maryland rule.

16

acquiesced in that historically, though it has the power

17

to overcome it, if it wishes, as it has done in the case

18

of the Atomic Energy Commission in Carson v. Rowen

19

Anderson when it wants to.

20

has been premised necessarily on different

21

considerations, as I explained earlier.

22

The first is the label legal incidence.

That's its purpose.

The

Congress has

He believe that Indian law

The second fiction is that under state law.

23

which Mr. Unna failed to point out, the sale of goods on

24

an Indian reservation to an Indian tribal governing body

25

would be exempt, and we argued that in the lower

courts.

However, state law also turns on another

2

fiction; by calling construction a service.

3

shows in this case that one-half of the total cost of

4

this $9 million school facility was in the form of

5 materials.
6

The record

Now, how can one escape the logic of Central

Machinery Company, not to say Warren Trading Post, by

7 saying, well, state law defines it as a service,
8

therefore we don't have to — it's not preempted and we

9 can tax the whole thing even though one-half of the cost
10

is on materials.
Furthermore, construction is a unique kind of

11
12

thing.

It involves the putting together of materials.

13

It is like assembling a muffler on a car.

If Warren

14 Trading Post had a car service next to it, I presume
15 that the purchase of a muffler and having it installed
16 by the person at Warren Trading Post would not exempt
17 that function from the licensing scheme.

How can you

18 turn this whole panoply of commercial regulation
19 established by Congress on such a distinction?
20

no line.
QUESTION;

21

22

There's

But do you agree or not that the

contractor here needn't be licensed under the Indian

23 trader laws in order to perform the construction
24 service?
25

MR. GROSS*

We believe that he was required to

be licensed had the Bureau of Indian Affairs enforced

2

those regulations.

3

Central Machinery where the Court held that the laws

4

themselves preempt the state from imposing the tax# and

5

what the BIA happened to do or did not do is

6

irrelevant.

7

the BIA approved of Lembke operating under this contract

8

to the school board.

QUESTION*

13

he needed a license?

14

MR. GROSS*

But do you think they thought that

Yes# I do. Your Honor.

The point

15

is that the regulations that govern the Navajo

16

reservation, in 25 C.F.R. Part 252 are substantially

17

different on just this point from the regulations that

18

were involved in the Mescalero v. —

20
21

QUESTION:

Are there lower court cases

contrary to your submission?
MR. GROSS:

I know of none other than the fact

22

that in Central Machinery and in Warren Trading Post

23

itself# the trading statutes were held by the lower

24

courts in Arizona as not to apply or be applicable.

25

QUESTION:

I know, but I’m talking about

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

services.

2

licensing?

3

Are there some cases on services and

MR. GROSS*

Your Honor, I believe there is a

4

case from South Dakota which says something about this

5

distinction.

6

name escapes me now, doesn't go to the heart of this

7

problem because involved in that case, as I understood

8

it, was a supermarket which primarily furnishes goods in

9

the form of food, commodities.

10

Excuse me.

11

The other point, of course, is that 25 C.F.R.

However, I suggest that that case, whose

12

Part 252 does not apply to South Dakota or to Pine Ridge

13

Reservation.

14

expressly governs services.

15

The fact is that 25 C.F.R. Part 252

So the question on the trading issue in this

16

case is simply did the Secretary of the Interior have

17

the power to do that, to issue a regulation that

18

included services on the Savajo reservation?

19

answer, of course, is yes.

20

the trading statutes involved which we maintain applies,

21

but so is the Navajo Treaty of 1868 which excludes all

22

non-Indians who are not authorized by the Secretary of

23

the Interior.
