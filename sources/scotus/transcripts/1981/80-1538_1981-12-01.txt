ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD L. ARNETT, ESQ*/

7

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

8

MR. ARNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

9 the Court, the questions before this Court today may and
10 indeed based on the last year's experience will dramatically
11 affect the future of the state of Texas and some of its
12 school districts.
13

Texas sits geographically right on top of the hub

14 of Mexico's population, in contrast to California, where the
15 bordering state of Mexico has a population -- had a
16 population of one million in 1970.

The four Mexican states

17 bordering Texas had populations of six milion.

It is

18 approximately one-third as far to Brownsville from Mexico
19 City as it is to San Diego.

When one considers the problem

20 of familial migration into this country, it seems reasonably
21 clear that Texas is indeed the state which will be most
22 dramatically impacted by this type of illegal migration.
23

When one considers the fact that Mexico's

24 population is doubling approximately every 20 years, and
25 that approximately four and a half million children of

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 school age

are out of school in Mexico right now because of

2 lack of adequate facilities, it doesn’t take a great deal of
3 imagination
4 for

the future.

5

With the federal government doing very little to

6 control the
7 illegal
8 the

problem other than to deny its largess to

aliens, and I use that term because it does describe

people that Texas seeks to exclude from its schools,

9 persons who
10 say,

are illegally present in the country, but as I

with the federal government doing very little, nothing

11 at all
12 in

to understand the Texas legislature's concerns

realistically, to help the impacted school districts

providing a basic program of education to their

13 residents,

be them legal or illegal presently, the Texas

14 legislature
15 Code

in

enacted Section 21031 of the Texas Education

1975 to curtail the drain of the state’s educational

16 resources and
17 promised
18

those of its districts, which drain only

to increase in the future.
Sow, Section 21031 basically codifies two distinct

19 provisions.

One denies state funding on the basis of the

20 attendance of pupils who are not lawfully admitted into the
21 state.

The other exempts from the requirement for

22 tuition-free admission that
23 those children

is imposed upon the districts

who are not lawfully admitted into the United

24 Sta tes.
25

Those two provisions conceivably could differ in

5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 result in this case.

The latter, not requiring school

2 districts to admit them, in essence leaves it at the
3 discretion of local districts to review their circumstances.
4

Now, we have raised the issue, and it has been

5 invited certainly by the decisions of this Court, the
6 consistent language of the decisions of this Court,
7 concerning whether illegal aliens are in fact protected by
8 the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
9

Our concerns rest more with the manner of the

10 application of the equal protection clause than they do the
11 application alone.

Texas has no interest in legislating in

12 an irrational manner.

However, Texas is very interested in

13 having their legitimate interests recognized by this Court,
14 and in the event that they are, we see no problems with
15 that.

It largely -- the application of the equal protection

16 clause largely presents a policy issue.
17

We don't really have too much to add to what we

18 have put in our brief on that point, and with the limited
19time we have here today, we would like to address the manner
20 of any application, as well as the underlying state
21 interests at issue here.
22

QUESTION i

Let me ask one question, counsel.

If

23 the equal protection clause is not protective of
24undocumented aliens, could the state of Texas impose harsher
25 criminal penalties upon them?

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. ARNETT:

Well, you may have Eighth Amendment

2 problems, it would seem to me. Your Honor.

Certainly were

3 the equal protection clause not applicable, and I might add
4 that we have restricted our argument in that respect to
5 governmental services; it seems to us that that is the one
6 area which may do the most -- may cause the most judicial
7 interference with political decisions in this area.
8

QUESTION:

There can't be any question, can there,

9 that an alien, documented or undocumented, brought before a
10 criminal court is entitled

to the same due process as any

11 other person in the United States?
12

MR. ARNETT:

No, Your Honor, it is not, and it may

13 well be that the due process clause in that respect may be
14 read to answer the problem that Justice Blackmun posed as
15 well as that which is also posed by the Fifth Circuit.
16

But in addressing the application of the equal

17 protection clause, the first thing

I think we need to look

18 at is the nature of the class at issue.

One of the

19 intimations and accusations in this case that I would like
20 to dispel immediately is that this statute embodies any
21 racial animus.
22

This whole case originated in

1975, when a

23 district on the border. Eagle Pass, which has a 95-percent
24 Mexican American population, decided to enact a policy
25 precluding illegal aliens from admission into their

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 schools.

The Attorney General of Texas was asked for his

2 opinion as to the legality of that.

The response was that

3 under our statutes existing at that time, all residents of
4 any classification, of any status had a right to go to
5 school.
6

Within a month, a Brownsville legislature --

7 legislator,

and Brownsville has a 90-percent Mexican

8 American student population , offered an amendment to a
9 pending bill which resulted in Section 21031.

Brownsville

10 and the Valley districts are the only districts to have
11 filed amicus briefs in this case.
12 here today.

They have representatives

They have also suffered a 700-percent increase

13 in the last year in illegal alien enrollment.
14

The purpose of this statute is to protect the

15 Mexican American population’s education in Texas.

It is not

16 to discriminate against them.
17

When one looks at the class, and indeed, when one

18 looks at the entire area of equal protection as applied to
19 illegal aliens, the first thing we see is the DeCanas case.
20 Now, admittedly, equal protection

was not directly before

21 the Court, but I think several commentators have noticed
22that the language of the court in talking about the state's
23 interest as well as the rights of illegal aliens in that
24 context are very easily transferrable into equal protection

25terms, and indeed,

when one compares DeCanas with Truax

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 versus Raich, it reaches entirely the opposite result.
2Truax didn’t even involve the total denial of employment.
3 DeCanas seemingly allows that.
4

At the same time that Truax was decided, the

5 doctrine at that time was that the governments, the state
6 governments could protect their resources from legal
7 aliens.

That has been obviously

8 the decisions of this Court,

substantially altered by

but the dichotomy between

9 employment in Truax and the government resources in Truax
10 would seem to make our case much stronger here than that of
11 California in DeCanas.
12

In determining what class we are looking at, it is

13 interesting to note that the trial court in Texas versus
14 Certain Named and Unnamed Undocumented Alien Children
15 defined the class to be all children who are or will be
16 excluded from Texas schools.

He thus included in that class

17 numerous, in fact, who knows

how many -- we feel that it may

18 be a disastrous number in the future -- children that lived
19-- were currently and are currently living in Mexico.
20

The effect of the lower court's decision is that

21 all they have to do is cross the border, and this is not a
22 border like going through customs, when you come into the
23 United States on an airplane.

This is a border that is very

24 easily walked across, and all you have to do is walk in and
25 you will have your rights.

Mr. Arnett --

Yes, Your Honor.

There are areas

the border is largely unregulated.

No question.
General Arnett, if you are dealing with

by just saying you must be a resident of the

We do have that qualification.
Well, then, you don't need it to deal

the problem of people who live in Mexico and come back
forth, do you?
MR. ARNETT;

That's right.

The problem would be

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

So you are really not trying to

2 persuade us that it is a problem dealing with people who
3 commute every day?
4

MR. ARNETT:

No, Your Honor, although the problems

5 in enforcing that -- that provision of the code, which is
621031(d), are profound for the border districts, and
7 certainly it aids in the enforcement of that regulation as
8 well, these other sections th3t are at issue here, but we do
9 have a statutory prohibition that technically covers that.
10

Our problems stem from the fact that all parties

11 agree that about 90 percent of the illegal aliens in this
12 country don’t bring their families, but with Mexico so close
13 to Texas, and with Mexico's situation as we see it
14 deteriorating, we are very much afraid that cases like this
15 involving the right particularly to education,

which is --

16 we agree wholeheartedly that education is extremely
17 important, important to our residents as well, and we feel
18 like that the trend may well be reversed in Texas, that in
19 fact many more may bring their children in.
20
21 please,

QUESTION:

I think --

Mr. Arnett, I would like to ask you,

whether Texas interprets the statute as applying to

22 exclude only students not capable of establishing domicile
23 under Texas law.
24

MR. ARNETT:

That question somewhat is analogous

25 to the question in Toll versus Moreno, and I think that one

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 could take the Texas legislature's decision in this regard
2 as being a

judgment that one legally not present in the

3 state is not entitled to establish a domicile.
4

QUESTION:

Is that Texas's interpretation of its

5 statute?
6

MR. ARNETT;

I don't believe that we have had that

7 interpretation addressed by our courts, so for purposes of
8 argument hare,

I am not really in a position to give the

9 Court an authoritative construction of Texas law, because it
10 hasn't

been made by our courts.
QUESTION:

11

12 clause applies

Assuming that the equal protection

to these students, would you tell me how you

13 would then analyze it, assuming a rational basis test were
14 applied?

What is the permissible state objective?

15

MR. ARNETT:

Well, there really is one overriding

16 state objective, and that is the preservation of the
17 educational resources of the state as well as those of the
18 districts.

Certainly there are -- the problem is localized

19 within Texas.

Brownsville has an extremely much more

20 difficult problem

than El Paso does, due to the differing

21 nature of the border city in Mexico.
22 has had

23

As I say, Brownsville

a 700-percent increase in one year.
QUESTION:

Do the undocumented aliens in Texas pay

24 taxes, the property taxes, for example, that are used to
25 support the schools?

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. ARNETT:

Well, there are various references in

2 the record to that in our briefs.

Certainly they are

3 subject -- the property they live in is subject to
4 taxation.

Now, whether they in fact add to the taxable

5 resources of the school district, we don't think they do.
6

QUESTION:

Does Texas have an income tax, a state

7 income tax?
8

MR. ARNETT:

9

QUESTION:

No, Your Honor.
You are relying on property taxes and

10 the ad valorem taxes?
11

MR. ARNETT:

Sales taxes, but our sales tax

12 exempts necessaries, so as I note in our brief, it really
13 involves a great deal of questions upon which there is very
14 little evidence in terms of trying to determine whether
15 there is a -- what the correlation is between taxes and
16 benefits.
17

Concerning our interests, the one interest that

18 Texas asserts here which we have predictably met with
19 opposition on as to whether that is permissible is that as a
20 subsidiary to protecting our resources, we would like to
21 reduce the incentive for illegal immigration, particularly
22 of families and of school aged children.
23

It has been said that we don't have a permissible

24 interest in that regard.

It seems to me that the Court's

25 language in Meyer versus Roe, that the state has legitimate

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 demographic concerns about the rate of its population
2 growth, and

that such concerns are basic to the future of

3 the state, dispels with that.

It also seems to me that the

4 Court's opinion in Sosna versus Iowa, which talked about the
5 interests of Iowa and not having an invasion for a divorce
6 mill type of effect supports that.
7

Hines versus Davidowitz, citing Thomas Jefferson,

8 to the effect that the states, whatever concerns the states
9 alone was left to them; what concerns the nation as a whole
10 was left to the nation.

In our case, this problem concerns

11 Tex
Texas far disproportionately to any other state in the
12 cou
country.

We have two Senators in this nation.

We have not

13 bee
been able to get much done about it.
14

QUESTION;

General Arnett, this may be sort of a

15 stu
stupid question, but I have some trouble understanding the
16 ffacts.
ac

If you know who all the illegal alien children in

17 the schools are, does the state take any steps to identify
18 the
their parents and suggest to the federal authorities that
19 the
they should be removed from the state?
20

MR. ARNETT;

Your Honor, the testimony in this

ri;
21 ttrial
was that the federal authorities get vastly more
references, vastly more complaints of illegal aliens than
22 ref'
the
23they
are able to handle, and the purpose of -23

QUESTION;

It seems to me that if you can identify

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 and you know they are residents, it seems to me a
2 particularly easy enforcement problem if you were desirous

3 of getting them excluded, if you know who they are, and I
4 presume you must, if you are going to throw them out of
5 class.
6

NR. ARNETT:

Well, what you do -- what we did do

7 is require documentation for admission.
8

QUESTION;

I see.

9

MR. ARNETT:

And we used those persons that came

10 in after the court's order when we talk about the 10,000

11 figure, and incidentally, those 10,000 may well net have
12 been here at the time of the court's order.

One month is

13 plenty of time for a lot of people to cross the border.
14

As far as whether we could reasonably expect

15 to deport them, we think not.

The evidence in this record

16 is that INS gets complaints from citizens all the time that
17 they don't follow, including addresses.

QUESTION;

Nr. Arnett, returning to the questions

2 with respect to whether the school district should assist
3 the federal government in the deportation of these people,
4 do I -- I have the impression that your friends on the other
5 side take the position that this is purely a federal matter,
6 and the states and local districts have no jurisdiction, no
7 responsibility for identifying deportable aliens.
8

MR. ARNETT:

Well, in fact, Your Honor, if you

9 accept the arguments of the other side, that we are
10 inf ringing upon a fundamental right, or this is a suspect
11 class, or that the state has no interest whatsoever in this
12 matter, then how could a statute or a rule which required us
13 to have the districts ask for documentation and turn them
14 over to the INS be constitutional?

That statute would

15 promote exactly the same interests that this statute
16promotes.

It would be a lot less effective.

MR.

HARDY:

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Hardy,

before you commence, what is

22 the process for documentation?

The briefs are full of

23 reference to undocumented aliens.
24 documented?
25

How does one become

And who does it?

MR. HARDY:

Locally,

within the Tyler Independent

1 School District, where this case originated, in the Doe v.
2 Tyler case,

we had a local policy that was enacted by the

3 school board to hopefully follow up to the state statute.
4 The state statute requiring -- I am going to argue,
5 hopefully, in a minute, on the residency-non-residency
6 status,

but the local policy was that if anyone that wanted

7 to attend the Tyler Independent School District or the local
8 school district on a tuition-free basis, all they had to
9 show was legal residence within our district, then that
10 could be done even if they could show any entitlement or
11 that they were seeking entitlement to be admitted to this
12 country legally, a letter to the Immigration and
13 Naturalization Service that they were applying, any
14 document, not that they had actually received that status,
15 but they were at least attempting to receive that legal
16 status.
17

In our case, I think it is important to note that

18 every one of these students and their parents, they came
19 across the border illegally.

They were illegal from the

20 first time they walked across the river.

They did not

21 overstay a green card or a work permit.
22

QUESTION:

If you say they are illegal, how could

23 Texas determine that they are legal?

You say they are

24 illegal when they come across, they stay there for six
25 months or whatever, and you document them as being legal

MR. HARDY:

QUESTION:

4

MR. HARDY:

5

QUESTION:

I agree
Isn't that right?
That's correct
And so you are telling me that without

6 some documentation it doesn't make any difference how long
7 an undocumented child is present in Texas.

You do not

8 recognize them as entitled to go to school or have the
9 privileges of domiciliaries or residents.
10

MR. HARDY:

That's correct, because if they do not

11 have legal resident status or domiciliary status legally, it
12 is our argument and our position that they cannot attain the
13 resident status requiring them to attend -- or allowing them
14 to attend school free of charge.

I think that the key issue

15 in this point is the classification in the statute.

It is

16 not alienage or citizenship; it is between a legal resident
17 and a non-legal resident, or a residency statute and a
18 non-residency statute.
19

The statute provides that non-resident citizens

20 and non-resident aliens are both required to pay tuition.
21 The state classification was based upon a judgment that the
22 state and the school district would provide a free education
23 for those who are legal residents, and I submit to the Court
24 that legal residents is more than mere presence within the
25 boundaries.

The Court has continuously held, and I think

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that it is an appropriate holding, that in higher education

2

branches, that a non-resident of the state can be charged a

3

different tuition than a resident of the state, and we are

4

talking about a resident within the country or a

5

non-resident on legal status, and I think that that is a

6

distinction that has to be to carry it out there.

MR. HARDY:

At least it suggests that

Yes, that if we were to try -- Texas

QUESTION;

Mr. Hardy, before you sit down, please,

The children themselves have a status

11 over which they have no control, the children of these
12 illegal aliens.

Does the Texas statute then punish these

13 children for something over which they have absolutely no
14 control?
15

MR. HARDY;

At a certain age, I would have to

16 argue that, yes, that the children -- I am realistic enough
17 to know that they don't have either the know-how or the
18knowledge to go through the process at INS.

They are legal residents of

I think that it is that simple, but

8 for some reason I haven't been able to boil it down that

that the resident and the non-resident status, I

10 believe, is the key issue before the Court.

Well,

the states under a long line of

12 decisions are prohibited under all but the most narrow

Yes, they do, and contrary to the

I would also like to point out that the residency

The state

That

71975.

That residency law worked until

Under that residency law, people who attempted to

8 just come across the border solely for the purpose of going
9 to school, there is a special provision within their
10 residency law that prevents people from simply coming across
11 the border for the sole purpose of going to school, and a
12 federal challenge to that statute was just completed in the
13 Fifth Circuit, and that statute was upheld, so that a child
14 cannot -- the name of the case is Arredondo versus
15Brockette, and there is a petition for cert pending.

So,

16 children cannot simply willy-nilly come into the school,
17stay there for a few days, solely for the purpose, leave
18 their parents behind, and attend school in Texas.
19

The state of Texas defines undocumented people as

20 residents for numerous purposes, trusts, wills, some
21 criminal proceedings, for the payment of property taxes, so
22they have had no trouble -- neither has the federal
23 government, for that matter, had trouble defining people who
24 are in a questionable immigration status, not a lawful,
25 permanent status with the green card.

Who

6 precisely are they keeping out of school?
7

Well, in this particular case they keep out of

8 school "illegal aliens".

Well, that term isn't used

9 anywhere in the Immigration or Nationality Act.

Under the

10 Immigration and Nationality Act, the legality of a person's
11 presence in this country is measured against deportation
12 statutes.

The statute says you cannot go to school if you

13 did not enter the country legally, but there are thousands
14 upon thousands of children who did not enter the country
15legally, yet they are entitled to remain in the United
16 States.
17

There are numerous statutes, there are numerous

18 regulat ions, and these are all covered in our brief, there
19 are numerous policies, there are operation instructions
20 which allow people to remain here even though they did not
21 enter "legally" as the District Court held.

Upon looking at

22this carefully, this particular statute, and its
23implementation, has been a monument to ambiguity.

They

24really don't know who they are keeping out of school.
25

Let me give you one example.

We had a witness

2 plaintiffs are under order of deportation;

they all entered

4 under federal immigration laws -- aside from the plaintiffs,
5 we had a witness testify.

This witness entered the United

6 States at the age of four months.
7 States citizen born in Texas.
8 permanent resident.
9 nine years.
10

Her father is a United

Her mother is a lawful

She has been in the United States for

She has attended school in two states.

This also gets to your question, Justice

11 Rehnquist, about putting up a wall between other states.
12 She didn't come to Texas from Mexico.

She came to Texas

13 from, I believe, Missouri, or New Jersey, where she attended
14 school for two years.
15 from this country.

This child will never be deportable

Maybe the New York Times would call her

16 an illegal alien, but no immigration judge would ever call
17 her an illegal alien.

No court would ever authorize her

18 deportation.
19

QUESTION:

You refer to her as documentable.

What

20 does that mean?
21

MR. SCHEY:

That means, Your Honor, that when she

22 gathers the necessary documents, when she gathers her
23 mother's birth certificate -- her mother was born in the
24 Yucatan, and she is represented by an immigration counsel,
25 and her immigration counsel testified that he had been

43
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 working for two years trying to get the mother's birth
2 certificate from the Yucatan.

Then they had to get the

3 father's birth certificate from Texas.

When they finally

4 gather all that preliminary documentation, they can go down
5 to the Immigration Service and begin the process of
6 documenting that child.
7

QUESTION;

8

MR. SCHEY;

We had the ex-commissioner --

Had this been done at the time of trial?
They were in the -- for two years they

9 had been in the process of gathering the preliminary
10 documentation.

Now, once they go down to the Immigration

11 Service, the Immigration Service doesn't do anything.

They

12 have a thousand people show up every morning filing these
13 kinds of applications.

They will only give you the kind of

14 letter that counsel for the state of Texas keeps talking
15 about.

Well, we will let these children in once they get a

16letter saying they are legally here.

The Immigration

17 Service doesn't give out those kind of letters.

What they

18will do is, once they have processed the child's
19 documentation, they will give that child a green card, or
20 they may even decide that this particular witness is a
21 derivative citizen,

and they will then give her citizenship

22 papers.
23

The ex-commissioner of the Immigration and

24 Naturalization Service testified in our trial.

That process

25 can take anywhere from two to seven years, given current

2 subsequent to this little child testifying that the chances
3 of this child ever being deported were simply zero.
4

So, we can say, well, who does this case involve?

5 Doesn’t it simply involve legal versus illegal aliens?
6Unfortun at ely , it is not that simple.

Here is a little

8 tried to enroll in the Texas public schools.

She was not

9 allowed to enroll, even though she had an immigration
10 counselor go down to the school with her.

13 open cases just like hers in Houston alone.

15 schools in the state of Texas.

QUESTION:

Your time is running.

Isn't your basic

17 position that in any event, however here, even though
18 admitted illegally, these children are persons under the
19 Fourteenth Amendment, entitled to protection of the equal
20 protection clause, and that that has been denied them, and
21 that this statute doesn't satisfy whatever the standard may
22 be of state interest?
23

MR. SCHEY:

24

QUESTION:

Isn't that your position?
That is our basic position.
Well, are you going to argue it?

25 haven’t heard a word on that.

MR. SCHEY:

That is our basic position.

Our basic

2 position is that regardless of a child's deportability or
3 non-deportability, in fact, none of these children have been

5 any rational basis for excluding these children from the
6 Texas schools.

QUESTION:

QUESTION;

Could a state legitimately have laws

15 laws and policies as opposed to this law where they conceded
16 at trial they hadn't even been in touch with the immigration

18 conceivably if they were to carefully track immigration
19 laws, regulations, and policies, and let me give you an
20 example that I could conceive of.

Thank you very much.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
MR. ROOS;

Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the

11 Court, as Mr. Schey has articulated, it is our view that the
12 nub of this case is that undocumented children are similarly
13 situated to their permanent resident and citizen
14 classmates.

I would like to highlight some of those facts,

15 and then get into the legal discussion that the Chief
16 Justice asked about concerning -- and Justice Brennan,
17 because the issues are on the table.
18

With respect to the residency situation, I think

19 it is highlighted by the fact that the plaintiffs in the Doe

They have paid taxes.

Their
Indeed,

6 these children -- there is a lot of discussion in the briefs
7 about the unique educational needs of undocumented
8 children.

Indeed, undocumented children are like other

9 children.

Some, like the Doe children, have been here for

10 15 years, have no English language problems, have no
11 particular problems whatsoever.

Others are new immigrants,

12 and as the testimony shows, like new immigrants, like all
13 new immigrants, they may have language needs, may have
14 various other needs, but indeed, to fence out a class of

11 remain here.

They are going to

And that testimony was repeatedly --

12 repeatedly repeated by his subordinates, the director of
13 the

Immigration and Naturaliation Service in Dallas and the

14 director in Houston, that indeed they do not find families.
15 Families generally are not reported to the Immigration and
16 Naturalization Service, and thus in fact will remain here.
17

Hr. Castillo also in making the statement observed

18 that, as others observed in the record, that indeed there
19 are something like 250 INS border patrol agents for 2,000
20 miles of Texas border, a number that is substantially fewer
21 than the number of police in Dallas, Texas.

Those

22 statistics, I think, tell us something about the commitment
23 to manning the border, and certainly tell us the likelihood
24 of these children ever being identified and deported.

15 not, and the policy reasons that underline Hines and those

QUESTION;

What about a posse comitatus, where a

2

MR. ROOSi

The equal protection clause speaks in

3 terms of coverage of persons, and it is to he contrasted
4 historically with the clause that immediately precedes the
5 equal protection and due process clause, which grants
6 privileges and immunities to citizens.

This Court has

7 looked to the due process and equal protection clause, or to
8 the due process clause and have said that persons are
9 undocumented -- include undocumented persons, because they
10 are indeed persons.
11

The legislative history which we have set forth in

12 our brief tells us really two things.

It first of all tells

13 us that the primary framers of the Fourteenth Amendment
14 clearly thought of, at least in terms of coverage, of the
15 due process clausa and the equal protection clause as
16 protecting the same group of people.

In our brief, we cite

17 to Representative Bingham, who was commonly acknowledged to
18 be the author of Section One of the Fourteenth Amendment,
19 and he spoke of the due process and equal protection clauses
20 alike as protecting the citizen and the stranger.
21

QUESTION:

Do you think Representative Bingham's

22 comments throughout those debates were consistent with one
23 another?
24

MR. ROOS:

Were --

25

QUESTION;

Consistent with one another?

56
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. BOOS;

Certainly with respect to coverage.

We

2 have found, and there is not cited in any opposing brief,
3 and there are, as the Court is aware, any number of opposing
4 briefs -5

QUESTION;

Well, there is the Congressional vote,

MR. BOOS;

Certainly.

6 too.
7

We found nothing that would

8 indicate that insofar as coverage is concerned, that
9 Representative Bingham said anything inconsistent with
10 that.

Likewise, on the floor of the Senate, the floor

11 manager was Senator Howard, and Senator Howard spoke of the
12 two clauses in terms of coverage in the same words, and
13 spoke of them together, and when he spoke of them, he spoke
14 of them as protecting whomever should be within the country.
15

So, I believe on the basis of the clear language

16 of those provisions, the history, and indeed the logic which
17 has been pointed out earlier, absent the right of coverage
18 under the equal protection clause,

the state could do, could

19 treat undocumented people arbitrarily and irrationally.
20 What would be the limitations upon a state should there not
21 be the minimal protection of the equal protection clause?
22

So, as well as the clear language and history of

23 that clausa, we believe that logic compells a similar
24 finding.
25

QUESTION;

If Texas is giving -- is required to

2 to come to the United States from Mexico, which they
3 apparently can do almost without any limit or hindrance,
4 does that tend to encourage or discourage the continuance of
5 this illegal migration north?
6

MR. POOS:

The evidence quite clearly reflects

7 that education is a minimal pull factor in terms of illegal
8 immigration.
9

QUESTION:

What e vidence ?

10

MR. ROOSi

That is repeatedly

11

QUESTION:

What evidence are you referring to?

12

MR. R00S;

I am referring to testimony by the

13 state's own witnesses.

We would, for example, refer to

14 Shane Davies, who said, as an attractive factor, no, it is
15 not .

We would refer to the testimony of the director of the

16 Immigration and Naturalization Service in Dallas, a Mr.
17Heston, who said, no, indeed, immigration, unlawful
18 immigration has little to do with -- or education has little
19 to do with unlawful immigration.
20

I would also point this Court to, with respect to

21 undocumented people returning to Mexico after the statute,

22 the evidence by, again, the state's own witness, the
23 superintendent of Brownsville, said, no matter what, these
24children will remain here.

So, I think that the fact is,

25 they will remain here, that indeed education is a minimal

58
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

My guestion is, is it a question of

16 state law?
17

MR. ROOS;

It is -- it would certainly be my view

18 that one could not use domicile as a proxy for alienage.
19 For example, well,

that if undocumented persons are indeed

20 persons under the equal protection clause, and thus a state
21 legislation must treat them minimally rationally, and indeed
22 we believe insofar as they are denied -- innocent children
23 are denied an education with heightened scrutiny, that that
24 indeed -- it could not then turn around and say, we have got
25a domiciliary law, aliens cannot become domiciliaries, and

59

That

2 would seem to be contrary to any sort of basic notions of

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Roos, are you arguing that even if

5 this statute were to be regarded as implementing a federal
6policy to exclude illegal aliens, even so regarded, that

22arguing that nevertheless the statute violates the equal

25indicated, this has minimal impact on keeping undocumented

predicated upon a different federal statute or set of

statutes, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which

7

in our view mandate that all children, especially those in

Would you make the same argument if you

of the states?

3

What is Texas supposed to do?

HR. R00S:

Well, I suppose the answer is that 49

4

other states admit these children because they feel that

5

they are here and it is their obligation to educate people

6

who are in their boundaries and who in fact need education.

7

Texas alone among the states poses this terrible dilemma,

8

and I think it is important to emphasize, as Mr. Schey

9

mentioned earlier, that indeed California, for example, the

10

testimony reflects likely has twice as many undocumented

11

persons as does Texas, yet the Court will note that an

9

I would like to address the point you asked about

10 the innocent children, and I would like to point out that in
11 Dandridge, in Lalli, in Matthews versus Lucas, all of those
12 cases affected the right of children on the basis of the
13 parents' conduct.

In fact, this case is much less

14 reprehensible, if you want to use that term, than those,
15 because here the parents' conduct is now.

The parents are

16 free to effect the conduct in question at this time.
17 were not free in Lalli once they were deceased.

They

They were

18 not free once they were deceased in Matthews versus Lucas.
19 It is clear -- and indeed, if you take the innocent children
20 line of reasoning, all children are a suspect class or
21 heightened scrutiny for purposes of residency, whether they
22 be illegal aliens or not.

Our society is somewhat based on

23 the control of parents over children, and that
24 differentiates it from trying to control the acts of parents
25 as to themselves with the illegitimacy through restrictions

1 on their children.
2

The other thing that has come up is domicile

3 versus residency, and the reason that has been somewhat
4 confused is, Texas does not require strict domicile to go to
5 school.

We do not require an indefinite intent to remain.

6 We require sort of quasi-domicile, and I think that we call
7 it residence under the statutes.

It has been interpreted by

8 our courts, and there are several decisions on this point,
9 that it is not as much as domicile, but it is more than

QUESTION;

I take it your policy is that until you

12 are documented or have some basis for being here legally,
13 that no one can acquire either domicile or this
14 quasi-residence.
15

ME. ARNETTi

That is exactly righ t, and my an swer

16 to Justice O'Connor's question earlier tha t there was n o
17 state court decision on it, that is in

the domicile are a .

19 Supreme Court by denying the writ in He rnan d e z and upho ldin g
20 the statute have made the decision that res idency for s chool
21 purposes cannot be illegal, it must be lega 1, and so to tha t
22extent I would say, yes, state law does mak e that
23 determination.

General Arnet t /

I didn''t understand one

You said that as a matter of state

23 construction of its own statutes, state law, that a person
24 not lawfully here was not a resident within the meaning of
