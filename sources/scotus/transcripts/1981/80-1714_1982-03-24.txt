ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWARD E. CARNES, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

MR. CARNES;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8 please the Court, this is a federal habeas case here on
9 certiorari from the Fifth Circut Court of Appeals.
10 Respondent in this case is a murderer named Evans who
11 was convicted and sentenced to death under the Alabama
12 capital punishment statute, which was later involved in
13 this Court’s decision in Beck v. Alabama.
14

At this time this Court handed down its Beck

15 decision. Respondent Evans* conviction and sentence had
16 already been affirmed by the state appellate courts.
17 This Court had denied certiorari, and the district court
18 had denied the federal habeas petition which is at issue
19 in this case.
20

After the Beck decision was handed down, the

21 Fifth Circuit reversed the denial of habeas, and held
22 that Beck required that Evans be retried and
23 resentenced.

It did so in spite of the fact that this

24 case is different from the Beck case in every material
25 way.

1

The facts in this case are virtually unique.

2 Early in 1977, Evans and a co-defendant named Fitter,
3 both of whom had just been released on parole from an
4 Indiana prison, began a cross-country crime spree.

That

5 crime spree lasted over two months, and by their own
6 admission, involved between two and three dozen violent
7 felonies committed in seven different states.

One of

8 those violent felonies was a robbery they committed of a
9 pawn shop in Mobile, Alabama, in January of 1977.
10

It is absolutely undisputed in the record that

11 pri
prior
or to that robbery, which is the basis of this case,
12 Evans
Eva ns and Ritter had discussed the possibility that one
13 of their robbery victims might try to go for a weapon,
14 and that they had agreed between themselves that if that
15 hap pened

hey would kill him.

16

When Evans and Ritter entered the pawn shop in

Mob ile, a man named Mr. Nassar was working behind the
17 Mobile,
counter.
nter .
18 cou

Evans pulled a pistol.

Nassar dropped to his

19 hands and knees behind the counter and started crawling
20 away.

Evans thought that Nassar might be going for a

21 gun, so he leaned over the counter and deliberately shot
22 him to death.
23

They then pulled another robbery in Mobile,

24 and left that state to continue their crime spree in
25 another state.

During the crime spree, and after they

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 had killed Nassar, Evans telephoned an FBI agent in his
2 home town and offered to turn himself in if that FBI
3 agent could guarantee Evans that he would be executed
4 when he turned himself in.

The agent told Evans he

5 couldn't make him any promises, and for that reason
6 Evans refused to turn himself in.

That is from Evans’

7 own sworn testimony at the grand jury.
8

After more robberies, Evans and Ritter were

9 finally captured in Little Rock, Arkansas, by FBI agents
10 in March of

1977.

From the very beginning, instead of

11 contesting his guilt, Evans admitted it and bragged
12 about it.

He confessed to the robbery and murder of

13 Nassar and the two to three dozen other violent felonies
14 he had committed to the FBI agent who captured him
15 within hours of his capture, to the Mobile police
16 officers after he waived extradition and was returned to
17 Alabama, and to the news media at every available
18 opportunity.
19

Evans insisted that he wanted to be convicted

20 and sentenced to death for the murder, and his
21 insistence on that so frustrated his attorneys that they
22 arranged through the court to have Evans examined by a
23 psychiatrist.

The psychiatrist did examine Evans, and

24 he reported back to the court that Evans was competent
25 and rational, that he knew the difference between right

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and wrong, that he thoroughly understood the nature and

2

consequences of his actions, and that he sincerely

3

preferred execution to a long term in prison.
Before that, Evans had voluntarily appeared

4
5

before the grand jury, over the objections of his

6

attorney, and had testified under oath to the grand jury

7

that he had robbed and murdered Mr. Nassar, that he

8

fully understood what he was doing, that Nassar was not

9

the first person he had killed, and that he would kill

10

again in the same situation.

Evans also testified to

11

the grand jury that he preferred execution over life in

12

prison.
Then, at arraignment, Evans pleaded guilty.

13
14

The judge entered Evans* guilty plea in the official

15

minutes of the court, but nonetheless scheduled the case

16

for trial, because that is the peculiar procedure in

17

Alabama capital case guilty pleas.

18

At the trial, the state presented overwhelming

19

evidence of Evans' guilt, including the testimony of eye

20

witnesses and undisputed scientific evidence.

21

state had rested its case, Evans filed a written motion

22

to plead guilty, which was accepted into evidence and

23

went to the jury.
QUESTION;

After the

Then Evans took -There is no dispute about all this

so far?

MR. CARNES;

2

QUESTION;

No dispute at all, Your Honor.
In that statement, in one of his

3 statements, did he not at least imply strongly that if
4 confined, as distinguished from being executed, he would
5 escape and Kill again?
6

MR. CARNES;

7 of fact, told the jury
8 the grand jury that.

Yes, Your Honor, he, as a matter
that at the trial, and he told
In the trial testimony on Page 38

9 of the Appendix, he said, "Our whole trip was based on
10 robbery.

Kind of a spree.

It was well planned, and

11 I've been in crime a long time.

Before you go back in

12 there, the only thing I've got to say to the jury is
13 that I've been at it a

long time, and if you don't come

14 back with a death sentence,

which is the only other

15 thing I can think you can come out with, I'm going to
16 get out and I'm going to do it again.

There's not any

17 question whatsoever."
18

Evans, in addition to testifying to that

19 before the trial jury, also testified under examination
20 by the district attorney that he felt no remorse about
21 the killing, and that he wouldn't hesitate to kill again
22 in the same situation.

He also admitted that his

23 attorneys had advised him some 20 to 30 times not to
24 take the course of action he was taking at trial.
25

There were absolutely no lesser included

offense evidence of any kind whatsoever presented at the

2 trial.

3 him.

The jury took less than 15 minutes to convict
The next day, the judge held a sentence hearing,

4 and after weighing the aggravating and mitigating
5 circumstances, found that the aggravating circumstances
6 far outweighed

the mitigating, and then the judge

7 sentenced Evans to death, as he had requested all along
8

to be sentenced.

9

After the case was affirmed by the Alabama

10

appellate courts and this Court denied cert, the habeas

11

petition, which is at issue in this Court, was filed in

12 the federal

district court in Mobile.

That habeas

13 petition -14

QUESTION:

Could you —

15

MR. CARNES:

16

QUESTION:

Excuse me.
-- tell me whether there was any

17 attempt made to file a habeas petition in the state
18 courts first?
MR. CARNES:

19
20 law,
21

No, Your Honor.

Under Alabama

what we have is a coram nobis petition, which is

the same thing, but under Alabama law you can't raise in

22 a coram nobis petition any issues that you could have

23 raised on appeal but didn't, and also, there's a very
24 strong line of authority in Alabama law that you can't
25 file a coram nobis petition or have any kind of

1

collateral review unless you aver that you’re innocent,

2 something which,
3

of course, no attorney representing

Evans could do.
So, we have conceded from the very beginning

4

5 that he had exhausted any state court remedies to have
6

his federal claims aired in state court.
QUESTION;

7
8

And the question could not have

been raised in a state habeas?
HR. CARNES;

9

Could not have been raised.

It

10

would have been rejected without any answer at all bein

11

required by the state.
The federal habeas petition that Evans filed

12
13 in

federal district court, or that his new attorneys

14 filed for him, did

aver that the preclusion clause

15 contained in the Alabama statute was unconstitutional
16 because it prohibited jury instructions when there was
17 evidence to support

them, something this Court later

18 found in the Beck case.

However, the habeas petition in this case did

19

20 not aver that there was no evidence
21

— that there was

any evidence to support a lesser included offense

22 instruction in this case,

and the habeas petition did

23 not aver that Evans had been harmed, affected,
24 influenced

or

in any way by the preclusion clause.

25 matter of fact, at the habeas hearing,

As a

Evans, through

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 his attorneys, insisted that he was attacking the
2 statute only on its face and as applied statewide
3 instead of for whatever reason it may have affected
4 him.

The district --

5

QUESTION:

In other words, he did not make the

6 argument on which the Fifth Circuit acted.
7
8 didn't.

MR. CARNES;

No, Your Honor, he surely

As a matter of fact, the habeas transcript, his

9 attorneys' remarks on the habeas transcript. Pages 34
10 and 43, they specifically say that he is not attacking
11 it because of anything it did to him.

Quoting his

12 attorney in the lower court on Page 34 of the hearing
13 transcript,

"First of all, we are not going to argue

14 whether or not capital punishment is good or bad, or
15 argue whether anything regarding the statute in
16 particular was applied in Mr. Evans' case in such a way
17 that it was unconstitutionally applied.

What we will be

18 arguing here is the unconstitutionality of the Alabama
19 death penalty statute both on its face and as it has
20 been applied in the state of Alabama," meaning statewide
21 in other cases.
22

They essentially attempted to use the habeas

23 petition as a declaratory judgment, but I doubt if even

24 -- they would have had even enough standing for a
25 declaratory judgment.

The district court denied the

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

petition.

Then, after the Beck decision was released,

2 the Fifth Circuit reversed.

To the state’s argument

3 that Evans had never even argued that he was harmed,
4 affected, or in any way influenced by the preclusion
5 clause, the Fifth Circuit replied, "However persuasive
6 this argument might otherwise be,

it has been foreclosed

7 by the Supreme Court."
8

What the Fifth Circuit thought foreclosed it

9 from making any inquiry into harm and prejudice was the
10

paragraph on Pages 642 and 643 of Justice Stevens’

11

opinion, where this Court said that, "In every case we

12

think," meaning in every case being discussed, "the

13 Alabama statute would lead to unreliable fact finding."
14

In lifting those three words, "in every case,"

15 out of context, and misinterpreting them, the Fifth
16 Circuit ignored the fact that the cert question was very
17 carefully limited in Beck to cases in which there was
18 factual evidence to support a lesser offense verdict.
19 Also, this Court’s holding on the very first page of the
20 Beck opinion says,
21

"We hold the death penalty may not be

imposed under these circumstances," referring to

22 circumstances in which

23

QUESTION*

there was lesser included offense.

Mr. Carnes, at this point, if the

24 Fifth Circuit should be affirmed and you lose this
25 procedure here, in your view, are you jeopardizing all

11

1 pre-Beck convictions in the state of Alabama?
2

MR. CARNES:

There is no question about it

9

3 Your Honor.
4

QUESTION:

How many are there?

5

MR. CARNES:

There were -- reading the Alabama

6 Supreme Court's Beck opinion on remand, there were at
7 least 50, plus, from the time of that -- my best
8 estimate is, there were more than 60.
9
10

QUESTION:

Sixty?

MR. CARNES:

11 and sentences.

More than 60 pre-Beck convictions

Of that number, Your Honor, we have

12 conceded that all but, at the outside, ten are entitled
13 to retrial under the Beck decision.
14

QUESTION:

Under the Beck decision?

15

MR. CARNES:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.
So that at the outside, only ten

17 then would be affected by this one -18

MR. CARNES:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. CARNES:

Yes, Your Honor.
-- if you lose.
It's Evans, Ritter, six more

21 before this Court now, and perhaps two more in the state
22 courts.

This is our most compelling case, and this

23 Court could conceivably issue a decision in this case
24 that Evans, and by extrapolation Ritter, were valid and
25 should be affirmed and not set aside, but that the

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

others were, because in none of the other cases did

2 people follow the unusual and unique course of action

3 that Evans and Bitter did here at the trial.
4

The frustrating thing --

QUESTION*

6 this summary,

Hay I ask, while you are giving us

those that you in effect concede were

7 covered by Beck, are they all cases in which the record
8 would have supported a lesser included offense?

Yes, sir. Your Honor.

The

away with my girlfriend.

2 the Fifth Circuit,
3 well,

Here we go beyond that.

In

in the initial opinion, they said,

the state is being fundamentally unfair to Mr.

4 Evans.

First, they told him there was no lesser

5 offense, and now they are saying, we ought to affirm his
6

death sentence because he didn’t present evidence of a

7 lesser offense.

That might be a valid argument for those other

8

9 cases, but in this case they ignored our argument where
10 we said,
11

look, not only was there no evidence, but we

can show you from this unusual, extraordinary record

12 that Evans was not influenced in any way,
13 not

have presented any evidence of any lesser included

14 offense,

that he launched this self-destructive legal

15 course before he was even captured,
16 knew anything about
17

19 well,

much less before he

the preclusion clause.

When we argued that, then the Fifth Circuit

18 came back and

said, oh, well, in effect, saying, oh,

even if you're right, we are foreclosed by the "in

20 every case"
21

that he would

language of Beck.

The frustrating thing about that was that it

22 seemed so clear to me that in Beck what this Court was
23 talking about was that in every case where
24 lesser offense evidence,

there was

there would be pressure on the

25 jury not to acquit the capital offense because the jury

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 was convinced the man was guilty of a serious lesser
2 offense.
3

You can’t have the jury convinced that he is

4 guilty of a serious lesser offense unless there is some
5 evidence that places in dispute an element of the higher
6 offense not necessary to the lower offense.

No jury

7 could rationally, anywhere, say that Evans might be
8 guilty of a serious lesser offense instead of the
9 capital offense.

Your opinion seemed so clear, but the

10 Fifth Circuit just wouldn’t see it.
11

In view of the fact that Beck itself does not

12 mandate reversal in this case, harm and prejudice is
13 necessary.

It's necessary because this Court’s

14 decisions recognize that there is a general requirement
15 of harm and prejudice to establish a constitutional
16 violation in any case, with two exceptions.

One is

17 where there is a specific Bill of Right guarantee
18 involved, which is not involved in this case, and the
19 other is where there is a denial of a procedural right
20 which has been specifically recognized as encompassed
21 within the right to fair trial.
22

The best example I know of this is the Beck

23 case itself.

This Court recognized at least in death

24 cases that the giving of lesser included offenses when
25 the evidence justified them was necessary to a fair

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 trial, specifically and necessary, but that doesn’t
2 control this case, because this Court has never held,
3 and no court has ever held that giving lesser included
4 offense instructions when there was no evidence to
5 support it was necessary for a fair trial.
6

Instead, their contention basically, and what

7 the Fifth Circuit probably is saying is that it is
8 fundamentally unfair, the existence of the preclusion
9 clause itself was unfair and detrimental.

Every

10 fundamental fairness claim this Court has ever decided,
11 it has required a showing of harm and prejudice.

The

12 burden to prove harm and prejudice should be on Evans,
13 not only because it is part of his claim, a threshold
14 part of his claim, but also because this is a habeas
15 corpus case.
16

The interesting thing about both the Fifth

17 Circuit opinions is, after they said initially this is a
18 habeas case in the Southern District of Alabama, they
19 never again mentioned habeas corpus.

Also, Evans, in

20 this Court, his entire brief, beside a passing
21 reference, the references to this habeas case, never
22 discusses the significance of this being a habeas corpus
23 case.

They ignore entirely Henderson v. Kibbe, where

24 this Court said that not only did you have to show
25 prejudice, but you had to show more than you would show

or what section of the Constitution says it?

2 will answer
3

it.

None.

I

None.

ME. CABNES;

We also find support for our

4 position that this is a specially significant case
5 because

it is a habeas corpus case from Mr. Justice

6 Stevens*

separate opinion earlier this month in Rose v.

7 Lundy.

The Fifth Circuit said, and they argue here,

8
9 that

Chapman v. California placed the burden on the

10 state to disprove harm and prejudice beyond a reasonable
11

doubt.

That is wrong because Chapman applies, as it

12 said, only

where a constitutional violation is first

13 established.
14 established

No constitutional violation has been
in this case.

15 is a threshold

Instead, harm and prejudice

requirement to their fundamental fairness

16 claim.
17

If this were a case where lesser included

18 offense instructions should

have been given because

19 there was evidence for them,

then Chapman would apply,

20 but there is no constitutional requirement for lesser
21 offense instructions absent evidence for them.
22

But in any event, perhaps it is a moot

23 argument,

because the record in this case not only does

24 not support
25 prejudiced

Evans' contention that he was harmed or
or any conceivable contention, but it also

18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

disproves beyond a reasonable doubt and beyond any doubt

2 any harm or prejudice on Evans.

It shows there was none.

3

It shows it in two ways, first, because there

4

was no evidence at trial at all to support it, and then

5

also because it shows that the preclusion clause didn't

6 influence or affect his course of action.

The best way

7

to point this out is from the crucial, decisive,

8

action before he knew anything at all about the

preclusion clause.

does not reflect that the existence of the preclusion

punishment statute, the one Evans was tried under, was

not a mandatory death penalty statute, as witnessed by

25

the undisputed fact that the judge was the sentencing

1 authority, and also Page 67 of this record shows that
2 roughly a third of the convictions were sentenced to
3 life without parole.
4

The problem was, it appeared from the jury's

5 perspective, as Mr. Justice Stevens pointed out in his
6 opinion in Beck, to be a mandatory one, because the jury
7 wasn't told of the judge's later sentencing function.
8 Our response to that is, fine, but according to Beck and
9 according to any reasoned analysis, the verdict form
10 requirement could have only two conceivable effects.
11 One would be at the guilt stage where, according to the
12 historical information in earlier cases, it might
13 impermissibly encourage the jury to acquit.
14 response to that is, so what?

Our

Why should Evans be

15 allowed to complain because his jury was impermissibly
16 encouraged to acquit him?

He was convicted in spite of

17 the preclusion clause and not because of it.
18

The second conceivable effect would be at the

19 sentence stage, where the fact that the jury had reached
20 a sentencing decision that had been publicly announced
21 before the judge came to making his decision could
22 conceivably impermissibly encourage the judge to
23 pronounce a sentence of death, something that was
24 alluded to in Beck.
25

Our position on that is twofold.

First of

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

all, sentencing errors never have been held to

2

invalidate otherwise reliable convictions.

3

Circuit in this case didn't just say, go back and

4 resentence Evans.

The Fifth

They said, go back and retry him.

5

QUESTION:

So did Beck, didn't it?

6

MR. CARNES;

Yes.

The specific holding said

7

that, but we have read it and interpreted it and

8

conceded it from our first reading of it that we had to

9

retry.

10

QUESTION:

Yes.

11

MR. CARNES:

The second position on the

12 mandatory verdict form requirement is that it could
13 conceivably

have affected even Evans' sentence in this

14 particular case,

because at every stage of the

15 proceeding Evans had asked
16 captured,

to be executed, before he was

throughout the grand jury, the trial, and so

17 forth and so on.

Any other sentence was inconceivable,

18 not only because Evans asked for it,
19 expressed no remorse,
20

21

not

but also because he

and told everybody, the jury, the

judge, everybody, "I'm going to do it again."
So, basically what we say here is, even if the

22 jury verdict form requirement was constitutional error
23 insofar as the sentence was concerned,
24 beyond a reasonable doubt,

the record proves

Chapman analysis, it was

25 harmless error.

21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

There is also an alternative ground for

2 affirming in this case — for affirming the conviction,
3 reversing the Fifth Circuit in this case, and that’s the
4 guilty plea.

Alabama has an unusual guilty plea in

5 capital cases rule.

The guilty plea rule basically is

6 that a guilty plea in a capital case is given effect,
7 but the case must still be submitted to the jury.

Under

8 Alabama’s unusual rule, the formula is something like
9 this.

A guilty plea plus evidence to support the jury's

10 verdict of guilt equal a waiver on appeal of
11 non-jurisdictional defects.
12

On appeal, the Alabama courts did in this case

13 consider the constitutional issues about the statute.
14 They had to in the process of determining whether there
15 were any jurisdictional defects, because there's a
16 two-step process.

One, are there any defects, any

17 unconstitutional parts of the statute?

If the answer to

18 that is yes, then they have to say, well, are these
19 severable or non-severable, because under Brady, the
20 unconstitutionality of a severable part of the statute
21 is waived, but in Alabama law and virtually every other
22 law, if some part of the statute had been determined to
23 be unconstitutional at the threshold inquiry, and then
24 had been determined to be non-severable, then the entire
25 statute would have fallen.

The conviction would have

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

been void ab initio, and the court would not have had

2 power to convict and sentence Evans under the statute,
3 and

we would have conceded it was jurisdictional error.

4 That is why
5

they approached that inquiry in this

particular case.
To the Fifth Circuit's holding that Evans'

6
7

guilty plea did not waive the preclusion clause because

8

it was limited to a waiver of antecedent defects, we

9 have two responses.
10 unconstitutionality

Our first response is, the
of the statutory provision on

11

preclusion clause existed from the time the statute was

12

enacted, and was in existence at the time that the Evans

13 case went to trial.

Therefore, it was an antecedent

14 def ect.
15

Secondly, even if it wasn't, under Menna v.

16 New York,

the effect of a guilty plea is to render

17 irrelevant anything
18 the factual
19 factual

guilt, and that does not stand in the way of

guilt once it's established.
QUESTION:

20
21

that is logically consistent with

Mr. Attorney General, do you read

the judgment of the court of appeals, if affirmed, as

22 requiring habeas relief in the form of a new trial on
23 guilt?
24

MR. CARNES;

Yes, Your Honor.

It said, the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN L. CARROLL, ESQ.,

25

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. CARROLL*

1

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

2

please the Court, I think in order to get an adequate

3

understanding of exactly what constitutional issues we

4

deal with in this case, it's important to understand the

5

framework of Alabama law as it applies directly to this

6

particular situation.

7

Under Alabama’s capital statute, capital murder and

8

felony murder are entirely different.

9

first degree murder.

10

Two points need to be made.

Felony murder is

It does not require a showing of

intent.

11

Capital murder, under the applicable decisions

12

of the Alabama Supreme Court, require a specific showing

13

of intent, leading to the present practice in Alabama

14

that juries are instructed, where the evidence supports

15

such instruction, that a defendant may be found guilty

16

of capital murder if the jury finds that he

17

intentionally killed a particular victim, or he may be

18

found guilty of felony murder if that intent is lacking,

19

and that is clearly the differentiating factor under

20

Alabama law between felony murder and capital murder.

21

It is not like many of the other states.
QUESTION*

22
23
24
25

May death be imposed in either

event ?
MR. CARROLL*

Death may only be imposed in the

case of the conviction for capital murder.

For a

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

conviction for felony murder, a life sentence with the

2 possibility of parole is the sentence.

3

How does that fit the evidence in

4

this case, that proposition of law that you have just

5

stated?

6

HR. CARROLL*

Chief Justice Burger, our

7

position is really multifaceted on how that particular

8

law fits this case.

9

in the record, particularly in Mr. Evans* grand jury

We contend that there is evidence

testimony, which indicates that had that grand jury

11

testimony been presented to the trial jury, the trial

12 judge would

have instructed on the lesser included

13

offense of felony murder.

14

about the intent that Hr. Evans possessed.

15

It raises a factual question

We do not say necessarily that these question

16

involve sufficiency of the evidence.

17

they involve questions of, would the trial judge have

18

instructed the jury on the lesser included offense of

19

felony murder, and under Alabama law, charges must be

20 given which

We only say that

are supported by any evidence, however weak

MR. CARROLL;

On this whole

question, though, of harm and prejudice, we refer to the

1 testimony that could have been presented to the trial

QUESTION:

What part of what is reproduced on

MR. CARROLL:

The fact that he says, "I'm the

Right.

19

MR. CARROLL:

20

QUESTION:

Let me --

I haven't let you get there.

21 That's right.
22

MR. CARROLL:

23 particular point.

Let me go back to that

Again, the crucial difference between

24 capital murder under Alabama law and first degree murder
25 is the question of intent, but more importantly, Alabama

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

has created a procedure that some other states have,

2 certainly not the majority,

for how to deal with capital

3 defendants, and their way to deal with capital
4 defendants is, always the case is tried.

You cannot

5 plead guilty under Alabama law, and the case cited by
6 both sides,

the Protho versus the State of Alabama, is

7 the decision of the Alabama court of criminal appeals
8

indicating that is the case.

9 under Alabama law.

You cannot plead guilty

You are entitled to have a jury try

10

the case, and you're entitled to have a jury fix the

11

punishment in the case.
Now, what that translates into is not some

12

13 sort of empty procedure, but in fact that every case
14 brought under a capital indictment in Alabama goes to a
15 trial by jury, and that's exactly what happened in this
16 particular case.

In this particular case, the judge

17 voir dired the jury, he sequestered the witnesses, he
18 said no one could sit who could not be fair and
19 impartial, there was argument of counsel, there was
20 presentation of evidence,
21

there was a charge to the

jury, and there was an important part of the charge to

22 the

jury that I think is worth noting, and that appears

23 on Page 44 of the Joint Appendix.
24

Judge Hoplander, who was the trial judge,

25 charged the jury, "I can only tell you that in reaching

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 your verdict, you may not take the simple approach and
2 say, if the defendant admits he did it, we go no
3 further.

You must reach a verdict that is supported by

4 all of the creditable evidence that has been presented
5 to you in this particular case."
6

So, even the trial judge did not see this as

7 an empty procedure.

The question then occurs, how does

8 the Beck decision and the infirmity in the Alabama
9 constitutional -- pardon me, the Alabama death penalty
10 law relate to this particular statute?
11 is simply this.

And the answer

Beck identified a fatal flaw in the

12 Alabama statute, that a jury was precluded from reaching
13 a verdict on a lesser included offense that was
14 supported by the evidence.

It made the procedure in

15 this case as infirm as the procedure in any other case,
16 and that flaw applies to cases like this, because in
17 every case in Alabama, even where there is an attempted

18 plea of guilty, the trial must be conducted in a
19 constitutional fashion.

That's the clear ruling of the

20 Alabama court and the clear ruling of the Constitution.
21

QUESTION:

Well,

what if this trial had taken

22 place after our decision in Beck, and the Alabama court
23 had simply said, we know we have to give an instruction
24 on a lesser included offense if the evidence supports
25 one, but here there just isn't any evidence supporting

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 one.

You wouldn't suggest that they still had to give

2 an instruction on a lesser included offense.
3

MR. CARROLL:

We would suggest that that would

4 frame an issue, a federal constitutional issue under
5 this Court's Beck decision.
6

QUESTION:

Well, can you imagine this Court or

7 any other court deciding that with no evidence to
8 support it it was a constitutional requirement that you
9 had to give an instruction on a lesser included offense?
10

MR. CARROLL:

Justice Rehnquist, where we

11 clearly differ is how the relevant inquiry proceeds.

Do

12 we look simply at the facts as they were presented to
13 the jury, or do we look further and look at the facts as
14 they could have been presented to the jury had it not
15 been for the preclusion clause or its existence.
16

QUESTION:

Well, I am hypothesizing a case

17 that came after Beck, so that the defendant would have
18 been on notice that he could have an instruction if the
19

evidence supported it.

20

NR. CARROLL:

Given the state of Alabama law,

21 which is this incredibly liberal standard as to what
22 lesser included offense instructions you are entitled
23 to, I would find it a rare case in Alabama where a trial
24

jury in a capital murder case was not instructed on the

25 issue of capital murder and felony murder.

In effect,

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

what that would be would be a directed verdict on the

2 issue of intent in a capital case, and I quite frankly
3 can't see our Alabama courts directing that kind

of

4 verdict *
5

QUESTION:

6 there is nothing in
7 lesser included
8

Counsel, do I understand you that
the trial record that justifies a

offense instruction?

MR, CARROLL:

Justice Marshal, our position on

9 that point is that the evidence as actually presented to
10
11

the trial jury.
QUESTION:

Well, I’m talking about -- that’s

12 the only kind of evidence I understand, is that there’s
13 nothing in this record,
14 in this record that

you admit that there is nothing

justifies a charge, an instruction

15 on a lesser included offense.
16

MR. CARROLL:

We do not concede that point.

17 We would argue that under the liberal standard of
18 Alabama's lesser included
19 testimony would support

offense law, that trial

the giving of a lesser included

20 offense on felony murder alone,

but we also point out to

21 the Court that there is other evidence in the record
22 that indicates that more evidence could

have been

23 presented to the trial jury.
24

QUESTION:

Was it offered?

25

MR. CARROLL:

Was it offered to the court and

34

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 then refused?
2

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

3

MB. CARROLL;

4

QUESTION;

No, it was not, Justice Marshal.

Well, what can you complain of if

5 something is not offered?
6

MR. CARROLL;

Well, I think we are into the

7 whole question of constitutional error, and what burdens
8 are upon whom to show what in a particular —
9

QUESTION;

Well, what constitutional provision

10 gives you the right to complain about evidence that you
11 didn’t offer?
12

MR. CARROLL;

Justice Marshal, John Evans was

13 convicted and tried under an unconstitutional death
14 penalty scheme, as unconstitutional as the schemes this
15 Court struck down in Woodson, as unconstitutional as the
16 schemes it struck down in Furman.

In those cases, there

17 was no inquiry into what evidence was before the trial
18 jury.
19

They were struck down on their face.
QUESTION;

Counsel, you are here, though, on

20 collateral attack.
21

QUESTION;

Your argument is unbelievable to me.

22

QUESTION;

You are here on a collateral

23 attack, and under Wainwright and Sykes, don’t you have
24 to show prejudice and cause to prevail here?
25

MR. CARROLL;

Under Wainwright and Sykes, we

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

must show cause and prejudice if there is some sort of

2 procedural default.

There has been no allegation by the

3 state, and in fact such an allegation would not be true,
4 that there is a procedural default.

The issue of the

5 constitutionality of the Alabama death

penalty statute

6 was reserved by the trial counsel in this case,
7 presented to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and
8

the Alabama Supreme Court, so this is a different

9 prejudice or different concept of prejudice that we deal
10 with here.

Our position as far as prejudice goes is

11

12 really threefold.

First of all, we contend that the

13 constitutional error in this case is one of those kinds
14 of constitutional error where prejudice is to be
15 presumed.

It is presumed because it is impossible to

16 ascertain on the face of this record what prejudice came
17 to

the defendant.

18 what would

It is impossible to ascertain exactly

have happened under a constitutional statute,

19 so that that fits squarely within the lines of cases of
20 this Court that says prejudice is to be presumed.
21

QUESTIONS

Well, what was the statute struck

22 down in Beck?
23

MR. CARROLL;

24

QUESTION;

This --

What was the rule struck down in

25 Beck?

MR. CARROLL:

1

The specific holding of the

2

Court was that the lesser included offense -- that the

3

preclusion of lesser included offense instructions was

4

constitutionally infirm.
QUESTION:

There was an Alabama rule that it

wouldn't have done you any good to offer evidence of a

7

lesser included offense.

That’s exactly right, Justice

So you were told, don't offer

MR. CARROLL:

We were told that offering

evidence would mean nothing.

17

QUESTION:

Yes.

18

MR. CARROLL:

But you haven't yet, at least

19

for my ear, mentioned a scintilla of evidence that would

hint of a lesser included offense.

22

MR. CARROLL:

Now, if you have

Mr. Chief Justice, the trial

record -- there is a close question on the evidence as

24

actually presented to the jury as to whether or not

25

there is evidence of a lesser included offense

instruction, but the defendant's grand jury testimony,

2 had that been presented to the trial jury,

would clearly

3

have warranted a lesser included offense instruction,

4

which brings me into the next cog of our argument on

5

prejudice.
Again, it's our position in the case that this

6
7

is an Eighth Amendment case, that this Court has never

8

said in the past that it is not — that it requires

9

prejudice when there's an Eighth Amendment violation.

12 process,

an Eighth Amendment violation, this

right which infects the entire trial

the method by which evidence is assembled into

the record.
QUESTION;

Counsel, let me try again.

You say

15

if you had given the same testimony that was given

16

before the grand jury, you would be in a position to

17

have the point raised about the lesser included offense.

2 don't know why certain things occurred -- indicate the
3 impossibility of the state carrying their burden of
4 proof that this is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.
5

QUESTION;

Are you suggesting sub silentio

6 that there was ineffective assistance of counsel here?
7

MR. CARROILi

We have never suggested that

8 there was, Chief Justice Burger.

The counsel was

9 operating within the incredible confines of this Alabama
10 death penalty law, which said you can do anything, you
11 can work, you can do anything, you can put evidence in
12 the record, but the jury cannot consider that.
13

QUESTIONS

He was also operating within the

14 confines of that statement which Evans made to the jury
15 that he did it and he would do it again the first chance
16 he got.
17

MR. CARROLL;

And also within the confines of

18 the statement that he gave to the grand jury that it was
19 instinct, that it was reflex, that it was
20 self-preservation, that they never went into the store
21 to harm anybody, and in fact in this alleged crime spree
22 that Evans and Ritter went through, they never harmed
23 anybody during the course of that crime spree.

There is

24 no other homicide, and Evans left two live witnesses in
25 the pawn shop.

There were two children.

There is one reference in his

No question, Chief Justice

but this crime spree that the state makes so

much about,

there were no allegations that another

10 homicide had occurred during that crime spree.

Again,

11

what the state asks this Court to do is turn this whole

12

question of harm, prejudice, and who must do what on its

13

ear, and create some new rules because of this case for

14

the questions of how harm and prejudice are to be

15

det ermined.
Again, this is the kind of violation, either

16
17

an Eighth Amendment violation or the kind of due process

18

violation, because of its effect on the whole trial

19

process.

It's a structural problem.

It infected the

20 entire structure of capital cases tried under this
21

particular law.
QUESTION*

22

Well, Beck had the foresight to put

23

in some evidence of a lesser included offense, did he

24

not ?

25

MR. CARROLL*

He did. Justice Rehnquist.

it would have done

QUESTION:

21 and the trial court refuses it,
22

MR. CARROLL:

you make a proffer.

And I think what we are into now

23 is a debate over what was the best course of action.
24 Was it to attack the constitutionality of the statute,
25 or was it to put evidence in and say that this was the

2 don't think

the law requires you to do both.

And in

3 fact the statute itself may have compelled some of the
4 behavior in this particular case, the fact that the
5 either-or option, life imprisonment without the
6 possibility of parole or the death sentence,

were the

7 only things that John Evans faced in the case.
8 was no realistic possibility of

acquittal.

Again I come back, how do you

10

reconcile what you are now saying with the statement

11

that he made to the trial jury?
MR. CARROLL:

12

There may be no way to reconcile

13 those questions, but they clearly raise an intent issue,
14 an intent issue that the jury should have decided.
15

QUESTION:

How would you get the grand jury

16 testimony before the jury after he made this statement?
MR. CARROLL:

17

By suggesting to the defendant

18 that he testify as he did before the grand jury, or by
19 referencing that in some fashion.
QUESTION:

20
21

Well, he said here he had talked to

the lawyers, is it 20 or 30, or 30 or 40 times about

22 this.

You are suggesting that after he made this

23 statement, he may make one that is quite contrary as you
24 see it?

MR. CARROLL:

Finally, this is a capital case,

22 and as this Court recently said in the Eddings case,

24 have to be doubts,

again, all that can be given to this

25 Court are the suppositions of both sides as to what

19 those situations which results in a sentence of life

We disagree as to the

22 interpretation of that case.

Mr. Carnes seems to say

I think there

are some significant doubts as to what harm and

not reach that, because this is the kind of case where

But there were some cases that were

8 ordered to be retried by the Alabama Supreme Court on
9 which cert wasn't taken.
10

MR. CARNES:

MR. CARNES;

No, sir, but this case is here on
