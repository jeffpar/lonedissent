CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

We will hear arguments

next in Blue Shield of Virginia against McCready.
Mr. Bell.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF GRIFFIN B. BELL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR.

BELL;

May it please the Court, this case

8

presents two questions.

there an antitrust injury alleged so as to withstand a

in Brunswick versus Pueblo Bowl-0-Mat.

being in the business of insurance under the

15

McCarren-Ferguson Act.

QUESTION;

the same time were entitled to benefits under Blue

That is the gist of the

She wishes to be reimbursed.

4

Her request for reimbursal was refused on the

5

grounds that the plan only covered physician's services

6

and other allied health services which are supervised by

7

and billed through a physician.

8

9

The case is complicated by the fact that there
was another case filed at the same time.

They started

10

out being heard together, and one was decided last year

11

by the Fourth Circuit.

12

that case, the district court ruled for the Blue Shield

that there was a restraint.

5

sector or area of restraining clinical psychologists by

6

not covering them under these contract.

7

that was devised, so the court held, by the two plans,

9

along with the doctors and particularly the

the base for this case brought by this patient of a

24

psychologist.

the McCarren-Ferguson point, because this Court granted

certiorari on a Second Circuit case called Pireno, and

2

it is pending here now.

3

and if we are exempt from antitrust coverage by

4

McCarren-Ferguson, then you wouldn't necessarily reach

5

the other point which is antitrust injury.

It is very much on our case,

Unfortunately, though, the questions tie

6
7

together because it has been held at one point in the

8

case, in the district court, that there was a boycott,

9

so if there was a boycott, then we have to get back to

10

the same issue, target area, was Mrs. McCready in the

11

sector or the area where the antitrust violation took

12

place.
There are three elements that must appear to

13
14

have an exemption under the McCarren-Ferguson Act.

15

First, there must be the business of insurance.

16

there has to be state regulation of the activity in

19

coverage.

20

Second,

And third, it must appear that there is no
There can't be a boycott and still have
They have the exemption.
Now, there is no doubt there was state

21

regulation here.

22

The two plans would not follow the state law.

23

contested it, and finally lost, but they won part of the

24

case, and that was that the Virginia Supreme Court said

25

the statute required that they deal directly with

That is what the lawsuit was about.
They

psychologists.

The Virginia Supreme Court said that

2

that was unconstitutional.

3

until July 1, 1979, so we are talking about damages that

4

accrued before July 1, 1979, but I don't think it is

5

contested, the the state regulation, so if this was the

6

business of insurance, this policy that they had that

7

you could only get allied health or medical -- health

8

services through a doctor, if that was underwriting or

9

spreading of the risk within the meaning of the Royal

It was not corrected up

10

Drug case, then we have the question — we have the

11

business of insurance.

12

So, the only element left to be decided would

13

be, was there a boycott.

14

District Court found, Judge Bond, this is the only

15

mention that has been made of this in all this

16

litigation, was that there was a boycott alleged.

17

at that time, he was dealing with a motion to dismiss

18

involving the doctors and the plans as well as Mrs.

19

McCready's case, and I read that to mean he was talking

20

about a boycott in this primary level or this sector

21

between doctors and psychologists.

22

Now, the boycott that the

Well,

If so, then the same answer would come from

23

the argument I am next going to make about antitrust

24

injury would indicate that there was no boycott, so

25

that's why I say that the two issues tie together.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Bell, I am not sure that I

2

understand how we properly reach the McCarren-Ferguson

3

Act issue.

4

it, did it?

Now, the court of appeals didn't consider

5

MR. BELL:

The court of appeals ignored it.

6

Well, I won't say ignored it.

7

QUESTION:

They did not consider it.

And so normally, presumably, we

8

wouldn't get into it, and does this case come to us on a

9

motion under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules?

10

MR. BELL*

It does.

11

QUESTION:

And we have to assume that the

12

allegations of the complaint are considered favorably to

13

the pleader, and has the plaintiff below at least allege

14

both a boycott and coercion.

15
16
17
18
19

MR. BELL:

They alleged a boycott twice in

there, in the complaint.
QUESTION:

So I wasn't sure how we would get

into the McCarren-Ferguson Act issue.
MR. BELL:

Well, this was in the district

20

court, and the court of appeals did not consider it, and

21

it was called to the court of appeals' attention on the

22

petition for rehearing, and I would assume that the

23

Court can deal with any issue that is in the case as a

24

part of the case, but I think that the short answer to

25

the question is that in spite of the fact that a boycott

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

is alleged, if the Court should conclude that the injury

2

suffered by Mrs. McCready was not in the area of the

3

antitrust violation, then there couldn't be a boycott.

4

Even if there was a boycott, it would not relate to

5

her.

It wouldn't —
QUESTION:

6
7

Well, if you are right on the

standing issue, that would end it, wouldn't it?

8

MR. BELL;

It would end it.

9

QUESTION;

You never get to the

10

McCarren-Ferguson Act then.
MR. BELL;

11

12

You wouldn't have to get to the

McCarren-Ferguson question.

13

QUESTION;

Right.

14

MR. BELL;

So, I will go -- I will just

15

mention one other thing about McCarren-Ferguson, and

16

then I will discontinue that argument, and that is that

17

in the Royal Drug case, and there have been some other

18

cases -- there is one case in the Fourth Circuit where

19

they said that peer review was the business of

20

insurance.

21

review is not.

22

me, whether we ought to cover clinical psychologists,

23

goes to the heart of the relationship between an insurer

24

and a subscriber or policy-holder, if you will.

25

goes to the heart of underwriting.

Pireno in the Second Circuit says peer
Well, this question we have, it seems to

underwrite, do you wish to underwrite this kind of

2

business, and how will the risk be spread?

3

mechanics of it such that it bears directly on spreading

4

the risk?

Is the

I think it does, but I will go on to the next

5

6

argument, because the next argument would end the case

7

if we are right about it, and that is antitrust injury.

8

Mas there an antitrust injury here within the meaning of

9

the decision in Brunswick versus Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat.

The

10

Fourth Circuit cited only two cases in support of their

11

rule, and one was Reiter versus Sonotone, a case

12

involving a direct purchaser and price fixing, nothing

13

like this case.
They cited their own case of South Carolina

14
15

Council of Milk Producers, where there had been a

16

breakdown in the competitive level of the retail

17

marketing.

18

farmers, the milk producers brought a suit saying that

19

it was adversely affecting the price of milk, and the

20

Fourth Circuit went off on two points.

21

these milk producers were in the sector of the economy

22

which was endangered by the antitrust activity, the

23

breakdown in competition, and then whether there was

24

proximate cause which would lead from that to these milk

25

producers.

Milk was being sold as a loss leader.

The

One was whether

9

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

They derided this case almost on the same

2

basis, which I think converts the antitrust law almost

3

into a general tort statute, and it is difficult,

4

though, to take any of the rules I have found in the

5

country, in all the cases in the circuits, and the

6

learned treatises, and apply them to facts.

7

said it pretty well in the district court.

8

while standing an antitrust injury may not be the same

9

issue, here there is no standing because there is no

10

antitrust injury.

11

starting out with a definition.

12

Judge Bond
He said that

He put it -- he tested it rather than

I think that Judge Mansfield in the Calderone

13

case almost hit onto a workable formula, but he kept

14

changing from target area to target, and I suppose there

15

can be sometimes where you wouldn't be a direct target,

16

yet you would still be covered if the -- if you were in

17

the area of the breakdown in the economy, so I first got

18

off on the idea that maybe we ought to talk about

19

targets, but I’m not certain that’s the way to do it,

20

and I end up, after looking at all the cases, where

21

there seems to be two clear groups.

22

the writers call categorization.

23

landlord or shareholder, a creditor who doesn't have

24

standing to complain about the antitrust violation.

25

then the others, it seemed to me to get down to whether

One is what some of

That would be like a

And

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

you are too far away from where the breakdown in the

2

economy took place.

3

This seems to me to be that kind of a case.

4

QUESTION;

Mr. Attorney General, it sounds

5

like that particular approach and maybe the target area,

6

too, is just an early way in the case to decide the

7

question of causation, and to avoid a long trial on that

8

if it's clear enough, because even if you lose at this

9

stage, you are goingn to be making the same argument

10

down on the end of the case that whatever injury that

11

was suffered here wasn't caused by the breakdown in

12

competition.

13

MR. BELL;

We would be making that argument.

14

QUESTION;

You are still going to be making it

15

later in the case.

16

MR. BELL:

Oh, yes.

17

QUESTION;

You say that you ought to be able

18
19

to make it now and avoid a long trial.
MR. BELL:

We are saying that the question can

20

be truncated, because it appears as a matter of law that

21

Mrs. McCready was far removed from the breakdown in the

22

competition which was between the doctors, that she was

23

two steps away.

24
25

QUESTION;

Isn't what you are saying in

essence that antitrust injury is a narrower concept than

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

injury which flows in a but for causation way from an

2

antitrust violation?
KB. BELL;

3

Exactly, and we think, the Fourth

4

Circuit treated it just like tort injury.

Antitrust

5

injury carries treble damages and attorneys' fees, and

6

we don’t think Congress — in fact this Court said so in

7

Brunswick, that it was to be a narrower category, and

8

the question, the problem is how to draw the line.

9

is very difficult to draw the line, but in this case it

The restraint was farther over, between the

18

doctors and these plans for not covering clinical

19

psychologists, so we — our argument is that if there

20

was an antitrust violation, which the Fourth Circuit

21

held in the other case, then you have to define the

22

sector of the economy and draw a line around it or

23

circle it, and then the next step, was she injured by

24

something that happened within that circle, and we say

25

she was not.

12

I guess that is why we have a

Well, except for the provision in

7

the contract, though, if the contract had covered the

8

services of clinical psychologists, she would have been

9

NR. BELL;

10

She would have been, if the

11

coverage had run to clinical psychologists, as it does

12

now.

13

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose —

14

MR. BELL;

It has been done now by statute.

15

QUESTION:

— if the contract incuded

16

chiropractors, if she went to a chiropractor, but it is

17

a matter of contract, then, isn’t it?

18

NR. BELL:

Yes, it is.

19

QUESTION;

Is this the basis on which — this

20

direct and indirect point you were mentioning, is that

21

the basis on which you distinguish Reiter against

22

Sonotone, that in Reiter the injury occurred directly

23

from the conspiracy to fix the prices?

24
25

NR. BELL:

Exactly.

Precisely.

In Reiter,

Mrs. Reiter was a purchaser in a market where prices had

11

12

QUESTIONS

I take it then that we should judge

13

this case, although I am sure you don’t concede that

14

there was an antitrust violation, but we must judge the

15

case at this stage as though there was one --

16

MR. BELLs

Yes.

17

QUESTION;

— that the promise between — that

18

the agreement was -- violated the antitrust laws?

19

MR. BELL;

You would have to because of the

other case which --

21

QUESTION;

Yes.

22

MR. BELLs

— we lost and applied for

certiorari and certiorari was denied, so they found an

24

antitrust violation by excluding psychologists.

QUESTION:

10

that was a restraint against the psychologists, and the

It was because
They were

that was found in the other case?
MR. BELL;

16

I — it is fairly difficult to tell

17

from reading the opinion, but I think it was — my best

18

judgment was, it was a restraint by the two plans, or

19

between the two plans.

20
21

MR. BELL;

The market for services of a

clinical psychologist.
QUESTION;

24
25

A restraint of what market or of

what —

22
23

QUESTION;

People in the market for mental

treatment?

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

MR. BELL:

1

Just the doctors.

Just the

2

clinical psychologists, not their patients.

3

that is very clear from the Fourth Circuit opinion.
QUESTION:

4
5

I think

But it's a restraint of

competition, or a boycott, was it?
MR. BELL:

6

Well, you could call it a boycott,

7

but the court wrote about two pages on the fact that

8

they wouldn't find a boycott because they wouldn't find

9

a boycott to be a per se violation in the medical

10

field.

11

that —

12

It is a very confusing opinion.

QUESTION:

I would say

Well, until you know what the

13

antitrust violation is, it is hard to understand an

14

argument that it didn't cause this injury.

15

MR. BELL:

We know that the violation -- the

16

parameters of the violation.

17

blocking out or boycotting the clinical psychologists,

18

not giving them coverage.

19

that I see from the opinion you could argue for a

20

broader area.

21

It was in the area of the

That is — there is no way

Now, if you could argue that the violation ran

22

to a much broader area, the field of health services,

23

and people buying health insurance, then you would have

24

quite a different question, and that is what makes the

25

rase hard, to draw the -- first, draw the line of where

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the violation was, and then connect the plaintiff to

2

that area of the violation.

3

where the competition was endangered by a breakdown due

4

to the antitrust violation, but it's an area, fulcrum,

5

it's some point of the violation.
QUESTION:

6

The cases say the sector

Is the effect of the Fourth Circuit

7

holding, the majority holding, that they can't have this

8

kind of a contract?

9

MR. BELL:

Well, they say you can't --

10

QUESTION:

Excluding clinical psychologists?

11

MR. BELL:

It is not quite that broad, because

12

the Virginia legislature, the general assembly of

13

Virginia passed a law that you had to deal directly with

14

any of these allied health services.

15

four or five of them.

16

psychologists.

17

to — if they are going to use their services, they have

18

to deal directly with them.

19

goes so far as saying you have to cover these people.

20

They called it the direct user statute, and this was in

21

litigation for several years, and it has been out for --

22

now, lost it, but as I read the Virginia Supreme Court

23

opinion, it is that you don't have to cover clinical

24

psychologists, but if you do, you have to deal with them

25

directly.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

Mr. Furr.

4

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WARWICK R. FURR, II, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6

MR. FURR;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court, this is a case in which the plaintiff

8

alleges — alleges in here complaint a direct financial

9

injury from conduct which has already been proven to be

10

a violation of the antitrust laws.

The allegations in

11

the complaint in the other case that esteemed counsel

12

referred to, the VACP case, are identical to the

3

operative acts of antitrust violation charged in this

4

complaint that is before the Court on this appeal from

5

the reversal of an order dismissing a complaint under

6

Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

7

Now, there are a couple of preliminary remarks

8

I wanted to make before I pick up the guestions of legal

9

injury or antitrust injury and the possibility of

20
21

McCarren-Ferguson exemption here.
First, the Petitioners' arguments in their

22

brief are shot through with factual assertions that the

23

Respondent here can't be injured, or she can't prove an

24

antitrust violation as to her, and coupled with other

25

assertions as to why their practices are defensible, and

18

1

why they are the business of insurance.

2

these factual assertions miss the mark in this Court.

3

These assertions for the most part are contested, if not

4

bitterly contested.

5

It seems to me

To take one example, they argue that she

6

cannot recover because her health insurance contract

7

precludes payments to clinical psychologists.

8

contrast, we contend, based on the unanimous decision by

9

the court of appeals in the VACP case, and the evidence

By

10

in that record, that for many years Blue Shield

11

interpreted the very same contracts at issue here to

12

treat clinical psychologists as physicians and to pay

13

them directly.

14

they did interpret the contracts to pay clinical

15

psychologists.

16

right, and we think we are right, that these are

17

contested factual issues on important facts.

18
19

20

More specifically, from 1962 to 1972,

So we think that regardless of who is

MR. FURSs

No, sir. Your Honor, but I think it

21

makes it very clear that when they make a decision in

22

1972 to restrict payments to clinical psychologists when

23

they have been interpreting those same contracts to

24

provide those payments, they are not expanding insurance

25

coverage, they are cutting off benefits to a group of

that is before this Court today, because of the question

would like to turn to the issue of standing to sue under

25

Section 4 of the Clayton Act.

complaint on its face alleges sufficient facts to

demonstrate the likelihood that she has been injured by

this early stage would defeat two key purposes of the

federal antitrust laws, compensation to victims and

deterrence of practices which hinder competition,

QUESTION;

Well, do you suggest that at this

stage it would be just a flat but for causation?
MR. FURR;

I think if the plaintiff alleges —

8

I think that is a threshold requirement, an allegation

9

of an antitrust violation, an allegation of cause and

10

fact, and there has to be somehow on the face of the

11

complaint, I would suggest, at least a possible

12

relationship in terms of the injury to competition and

13

the injury that was inflicted on her.

14

QUESTION;

What if I plead in a complaint that

15

I am a landlord and I had a tenant who has been

16

subjected to an antitrust violation and as a result he

17

has gone oat of business, and as a result I have not

18

been able to collect, my rent?

19

antitrust injury?

20

MR. FURR;

Do you think that that is

I think that the statute on its

21

face would allow that case to go forward, at least into

22

a factual investigatory stage.

23

QUESTION;

Well, what if the factual

24

investigatory stage fully supported the allegations of

25

the complaint, and nothing more, that there was a

27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

landlord, there was a tenant, the tenant had been

2

subjected to an antitrust violation and gone out of

3

business, and the landlord couldn't collect his rent?

4

MR. FURR:

Well, I think, that most of the

5

courts that have dealt with that have, and you are

6

speaking to one category of antitrust standing, the

7

so-called landlord cases under the direct injury test, I

8

think the courts have usually cut off injury there, or

9

the right to assert injury because of the possibility of

10

duplicative recovery.

I suggest that we don't have

11

those facts here, but I would have to say the statute on

12

its face is broad enough to allow that, to allow the

13

case to go forward.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Furr —

15

MR. FURR:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION:

-- isn't this really a fight

between the psychiatrists and the psychologists, and if

18

so, how did you happen to exclude the psychologists from

the plaintiffs in this case?

isn't it a fight or primarily a fight?
MR. FURR:

I believe that it is a situation

where, because of the peculiar nature of the health care

Honor.

MR. FURR;

That case held that the joint

15

action by the defendants, the Blue Shield defendants in

16

this identical time frame to withdraw payment and to

17

exclude clinical psychologists from direct payment for

18

their services was a violation of the antitrust laws.

19

QUESTION;

But wouldn't you have had a

20

stronger case if you had included th em , so you wouldn

21

be arguing about standing?

22

MR. FURR;

Well, Your Honor, the two cases

If I could, I would like to turn to the

language of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, and why I

8

think that it cannot be construed so narrowly in the

circumstances that some of the lower courts have done.

10

I wanted to make certain at the outset that we recognize

11

that the standing concept here is a special one.

12

not talking about standing in the sense of Article III

13

and whether there is a case or controversy that is

14

justiciable where someone has a stakehold in the

15

outcome.

16

We are

This is clearly a special kind of antitrust

17

standing which would, if adopted, certainly if the

18

Petitioner’s rule would be accepted, would limit actions

19

in the federal courts for federal causes of action which

20

reflect important federal policy.

21

limitation would involve an imposition of a judicial

22

certain that a restrictive reading is justified.
The statute itself says that any person who

shall be injured in his business or property by reason

of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue in

the district courts and recovery threefold his damages

plus reasonable cost of suit and attorneys' fees.

Under the language you just read, is it your position

that the landlord was injured by the antitrust action

because the tenant could no longer pay his rent?

that violation, of course, but does the landlord have

22

The tenant may have some recovery for

That is the question.
MR. FURR;

The statute on its face, Your

23

Honor, is broad enough to allow that recovery, and the

24

question this Court, I am sure, wants is whether the

25

lower court decisions restricting that should be the

32

QUESTION;

That is the issue.
Well, in fact, if we rely on the

3

literal language, it would allow a shareholder of the

4

landlord to recover, too.

5

MR. FURR;

That's correct, Your Honor, and

6

this has bothered the lower courts.

7

I would call pigeonhole cases they have developed

8

categories that would restrict particular plaintiff, the

9

shareholder exception --

10
11

12

QUESTION;

In a series of what

But you are not arguing we should

read the statute literally, are you?
MR. FURR;

I think the statute has to be read

13

in terms of, first, its language, and second, the

14

legislative history and its purpose.

15

QUESTION;

Well, are you arguing that we give

16

it its full literal meaning, allow everyone to recover

17

who is injured by reason of an antitrust violation?

18

MR. FURR;

Well, we would argue that you allow

19

everyone to recover who is injured -- well, first we

20

argue you would allow everyone at least to proceed with

21

his case past the 12(b)(6) stage who alleges that he has

22

been injured by reason of --

23

QUESTION;

You would allow the shareholder of

24

the landlord whose tenant was injured to proceed beyond

25

a motion to dimiss then.

1

MR. FURR;

Unless allowing him to proceed

2

would defeat antitrust policy rather than promote it,

3

and this is where I think, the Brunswick case would come

4

into play as a possible rational reading of the statute

5

to impose by the judiciary a limit on the ambit of

6

liability, but the statute was designed to deter

7

violations, and the statute was designed to see that

8

people who had been injured because of those violations

9

recover.
QUESTION;

10

Well, are you asking us to overrule

11

Illinois Brick, for example?

12

MR. FURR;

No, lour Honor, I am not, because I

13

think the Illinois Brick case reflects a decision to cut

14

off the risk of duplicative recovery and administrative

15

— the administrative impossibility of trying to trace

16

damages through successive chains.

You could define it that narrowly,

antitrust violation, and since Congress has said they

are supposed to give it up plus treble, I don't think we

restriction that would allow defendants to keep part of

the illicit gains from the antitrust violation.

QUESTION:

Well,

except that I suppose that if

the psychologist got less business because of this, he

can recover, can't he?

10

MR. FURR:

He could recover, but as the Fourth

Circuit found —

QUESTION:

Nell, that is really my question,

because here, as I understand the conspiracy, it is

putting the economic pressure on the psychologist by

saying, you are not going to get insurance

11

reimbursement.

12

are not going to be able to borrow money?

13

How is that different from saying, you

MR. FURR;

Because the very instrumentality

used to achieve that were all the subscribers who were

entitled to the benefit.

injury as you could possibly imagine.

this reimbursement wouldn't be made, and couldn't the

months down the road when the

2

facts are developed, but it certainly isn't a defense at

3

this stage of the proceeding.

4

To try to sum up on this part of the argument,

5

she meets all of the classic tests that the lower courts

6

have imposed of antitrust standing.

7

complaint at this early stage of the proceeding would

8

serve no important federal purpose.

9

reasons to cut the complaint off now.

To cut off her

There are no
There would be no

10

double recovery, as in the landlord case possibility, no

11

complex problems of proof or apportionment of damages,

12

and proceeding with her case would not in any way

13

interfere with competition in the health care market.

14

Allowing her case to go forward would ensure

15

at least the possibility of compensation to her, and

16

would discourage defendants from adopting restrictive

17

practices which could ultimately if successful exclude

18

psychologists by making it too expensive for subscribers

19

to consult them.

20

has to harmonize any kind of restriction rule at all on

21

the language of Section 4 of the Clayton Act, as per

22

Brunswick, it simply should be that we shouldn't allow

23

an antitrust plaintiff to go forward as possibly in

24

Brunswick where actually the recovery of damages would

25

tend to defeat competition rather than promote it.

So that we believe that if the court

Here, by making her whole and making the

1

2

defendants stop their practice of refusing to pay her,

3

we also encourage competition, and in that light, she

4

certainly should be allowed to go forward.
Now, I want to just very quickly speak to the

5
6

McCarren-Ferguson Act exemption.

We allege a boycott.

7

That is sufficient under Barry to proceed.

8

importantly, even if the business of insurance was an

9

issue here, it certainly cannot come up on a motion to

More

11

talks about underwriting of risk, distribution of risk,

12

or insurance contracts, and if -- under Royal Drug, if

13

the defendants want to demonstrate that their decision,

14

which we say was simply an antitrust conspiracy, was in

15

fact an insurance decision, they have the affirmative

16

obligation of proving that in a plenary proceeding.

17

There is nothing in the complaint that allows them to

18

even make that argument.
Therefore, the UcCarren-Ferguson Act exemption

19
20

is not properly before this Court.
For all of these reasons, we think the case

Now, that is said in Brunswick.

It says there

that antitrust laws are designed to protect competition,

20

without doubt in this case that the competition injured

on that?

I have been thinking about this, after the

question I asked your opponent.

of hard to think through the case with the insurance in

it.

5

we are going to boycott the banks in order to get the

6

banks to refuse to do business with the psychologists in

successful, and some banks lost business as a result of

the boycott.

Now, they are aiming at the psychologists,

but they hurt the banks in accomplishing their

objective.

MS. BELLi

12

Well, they might be, because the

13

way you describe it, they both are subject — the

14

subject matter of the boycott, the bank and the

15

psychologist.
QUESTION:

16

But his theory, as I understand it,

17

in his colloquy with Justice White, is that, well, they

are refusing to pay benefits to people who do business

with the psychologists that we want to put out of
