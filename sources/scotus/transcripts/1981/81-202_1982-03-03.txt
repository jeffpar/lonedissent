We will hear arguments

MR. CUTLER^

system and other public facilities.

2

In our view, this case raises two

3

constitutional questions.

4

business enterprises in support of a petition for

5

redress of civil rights grievances conducted by

6

non-violent means, such as speeches, marches,

7

distributing leaflets, picketing, and social ostracism,

8

can constitutionally expose all participants to

9

liability for a common law conspiracy and a damage

One is whether a boycott of

10

judgment for all business losses caused by the boycott

11

merely because some episodes of violence by some

12

participants were found to be present during its course.
The second is whether, even assuming the

13
14

constitutionality of such a damage award, all the active

15

participants may be perpetually enjoined from peaceful

16

activities in further pursuit of the boycott.
QUESTION;

17

Do you mean by that, Mr. Cutler,

18

that any damage factor particularly should be focused on

19

the particular individuals identified as connected with

20

violence?
MR. CUTLER;

21

On particular individuals, Mr.

22

Chief Justice, and on the particular portion of the

23

business losses resulting from those acts of violence.

24

Yes, sir.

25

QUESTION;

In other words, you are saying the

particular acts, when and if identified —

2

MR. CUTLER:

3

QUESTION;

4

— must be shown to have had this

consequence on the business losses.

5

6

Yes, sir.

MR. CUTLER:

That is correct, Mr. Chief

Justice.

7

We believe the Respondents have sidestepped

8

both of these issues.

9

second issue, the injunction issue.
QUESTION;

10

They have virtually conceded the

On that, Mr. Cutler, didn't the

11

Supreme Court of Mississippi say that you had waived

12

that point by failing to argue it?
MR. CUTLER;

13

They said it was moot, Justice

14

Rehnquist.

15

below on — including the injunction, on First Amendment

16

grounds.

17

that the — we had admitted the injunction was moot, we

18

filed a petition for rehearing saying we had not

19

admitted that, that the injunction was still in effect,

20

and that it was an unlawful injunction for overbreadth,

21

and our petition for rehearing was denied, and the

22

injunction remains in effect subject, of course, to the

23

stay of the Fifth Circuit which will terminate when this

24

Court has passed on this case.

25

We did argue against the entire judgment

When the Supreme Court of Mississippi said

QUESTION;

So you contend you did argue the

1

merits of the injunction in the supreme
KB. CUTLER;

2

We say we did, and we certainly

3

argued it on the rehearing.

4

about that.

There would be no ambiguity

We argued —

5

QUESTION;

Was there ambiguity the first time?

6

MR. CUTLER;

We argued the First Amendment

7

invalidity of the entire judgment below in our briefs

8

below.

9

The Respondents have said they would be

10

willing to delete from the injunction any restraint on

11

peaceful boycott activities, so that seems to be out of

12

the case.

13

Court should not pass at this time on whether the First

14

Amendment protects the right to engage in peaceful

15

boycott activities because in their view this boycott

16

was not peaceful and violence was pervasive and central

17

to its success, and to sustain this charge, they go far

18

beyond the actual findings and conclusions of the courts

19

below.

20

As for the first issue, they say that the

The courts below, we say, did not find

21

violence to be pervasive or central to the success of

22

the boycott, and you will not find those terms or any

23

fair equivalent in their opinions.

24

Supreme Court cited 12 incidents over a period of three

25

years to support its conclusion that "force, violence,

The Mississippi

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and threats” were "present" during the course of the

2

boycott and were "part of the boycott activity" that

3

contributed to its success, and that this was enough to

4

make all active boycott participants liable at common

5

law for all the business losses suffered by the

6

merchants.

7

Before I turn to those 12 incidents, I would

8

like to outline our basic legal position in three simple

9

points.

The first is that this nation was born out of a

10

series of colonial boycotts against British merchants in

11

support of petitions to the British king and Parliament

12

for the redress of grievances.

13

enforce these boycotts led to the First Continental

14

Congress, and provided the cohesion that ultimately

15

enabled the American colonies to win their independence.

The need to organize and

These boycotts were enforced by many of the

16
17

same methods of surveillance, denunciation, and

18

ostracism used in Claiborne County, and occasionally

19

there were episodes of violence, such as the Boston Tea

20

Party.

21

leaders of the colonial boycotts regarded them as lawful

22

methods of petition for the redress of grievances, while

23

conceding that the perpetrators of unlawful acts, like

24

the Boston Tea Party, should be held answerable for

25

their conduct, and we maintain that this boycott was a

Thomas Jefferson, John Dickinson, and other

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

lawful method of petition, while conceding that if any

2

Petitioner were found to have committed or to have

3

threatened to commit an act of violence to enforce the

4

boycott, that Petitioner would be answerable for the

5

proven consequences of his act.

6

My second point is that if some acts of

7

violence are interspersed among other peaceful acts,

8

such as meetings, parades, speeches, and even such

9

measures of non-violent enforcement as surveillance,

10

denunciation, and ostracism, as was true of the enforced

11

colonial boycotts, and we sumbit it is the most that was

12

true in Claiborne County, then only those found to have

13

committed the violent acts may constitutionally be held

14

liable for anything, and that even they may be held only

15

for that portion of the merchant's business losses that

16

is reasonably attributable to those violent acts.

17

While I suppose one could hypothesize a

18

boycott in which no customer would have withheld his

19

patronage, but for the violent acts of the organizers,

20

as Justice Brennan hypothesized in the Gibbs case, so

21

that those who committed these acts would be liable for

22

all the business losses of the merchants, that

23

hypothesis,

24

case, and in the Mississippi Supreme Court, the

25

Respondents conceded that "most of the witnesses" that

we say, is very far from the facts of this

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

they themselves had called to testify had said "they

2

voluntarily vent along with the NAACP and their fellow

3

black citizens in honoring and observing the boycott

4

because they wanted the boycott.
My third point is a corrolary of the first

5
6

two.

We submit that no one may be held liable

7

constitutionally merely for organizing or participating

8

in a political boycott in support of a petition for the

9

redress of grievance, or for enforcing it by non-violent

10

means, or for continuing to support it even though some

11

other participants have been engaging in acts of

12

violence.
Our first four Presidents, all three authors

13
14

of The Federalist Papers, and many other Framers of the

15

Constitution participated in several boycotts of

16

precisely this kind.

17

method of supporting the right of British subjects to

18

petition for the redress of grievances, and when they

19

adopted the First Amendment, we submit, they could not

20

possibly have intended to exclude from its protection

21

the very means of petition that they themselves had

22

employed.

They believed them to be a lawful

23

Indeed, after the revolution, and at the very

24

time that the Constitution was being ratified, John Jay

25

and Alexander Hamilton were leading a boycott enforced

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

by similar non-violent means against New York City

2

merchants who engaged in the slave trade, and against

3

newspapers which carried the advertisements of those

4

merchants.
I would also add that we are not — we don’t

5

6

think this case raises, of course, the issue of whether

7

such boycotts are a wise political tactic, but only

8

whether they are protected by the First Amendment, and

9

we don’t think this case presents the issue of the

10

constitutionality of a secondary political boycott

11

against neutral parties, even though colonial history

12

would support that, because these merchants were deeply

13

involved both in their own discriminatory policies and

14

those of the city and county governments, and because

15

the Mississippi Supreme Court adopted a theory of

16

liability which expressly stated it didn’t matter

17

whether the boycott was primary, secondary, or anything

18

else.

19

Nor do we think this case presents the issue

20

of the constitutionality of a boycott that is unrelated

21

to a petition for the redress of grievaces against the

22

government.

23

Now, I would like, if I could, to come back to

24

the 12 incidents.

They are summarized at Pages 28

25

through 33 of our main brief.

In only one of those 12

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

incidents did the court below find that an identified

2

Petitioner committed a violent act to enforce the

3

boycott.

4

testified that he had trampled the flower garden of a

5

black woman because she patronized white stores, despite

6

his warning not to do so, as she continued to do

7

thereafter.

8

9

In that incident. Petitioner James Bailey

And the trial record shows, and this trial was
— began in

1973, Mr. Chief Justice, that no one else in

10

the town had ever heard of that incident until Bailey

11

brought it up on the witness stand, and it could not

12

possibly have affected the success of the boycott.

13

Witness after witness was asked, once Bailey said this,

14

did you ever hear of this incident, and they all said no.

15

There were two other incidents involving acts

16

of violence that were charged to identified Petitioners,

17

but in neither case did the courts below make a finding

18

that the Petitioner, any Petitioner had committed an

19

unlawful act.

20

QUESTIONS

I take it, Mr. Cutler, that you are

21

saying that a secondary consequence is not an adequate

22

basis for recovery, that is, that this man who committed

23

this violent act on the local resident in order to

24

persuade her or force her into refusing to deal, that

25

that kind of a secondary consequence is not to be a

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

basis for recovery.

Is that it?

MR. CUTLER:

2

No, I am not saying that, Mr.

3

Chief Justice.

4

unlawful act, be it violence or any other normal tort or

5

crime, and that incident had the effect of persuading or

6

coercing a substantial number of people not to

7

participate in the boycott and therefore contributed

8

materially to the success of the boycott, we would admit

9

that that individual is subject to liability for the

10

If any boycott participant committed an

proven damages of the unlawful act he committed.
QUESTION:

11

But then relating it to this

12

particular episode, that would mean only the loss of the

13

custom of this particular woman whose garden was damaged.
MR. CUTLER:

14
15

Except that she continued to

trade at the white stores, as the testimony shows.

16

QUESTION:

That evidence is undisputed?

17

MR. CUTLER:

Yes.

The only evidence is

18

Bailey's evidence, and no evidence to contradict that

19

was offered.
QUESTION:

20
21

In other words, whatever the effort

was to persuade her —

22

MR. CUTLER:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

That’s right.
— the record shows it did not

succeed.
MR. CUTLER:

He was asked by — Bailey was

asked by Mr. Pyles, did she continue to trade at the

2

white stores?

3

Answer;

QUESTION:

Yes.

That is in the transcript.

Mr. Gilmore, was — rather, Mr.

4

Cutler, wasn't the Gilmore shooting incident identified

5

with one of three of the Petitioners?

6

MR. CUTLER;

The Gilmore shooting incident is

7

the next one I am coming to, Justice Stevens.

There

8

were three -- three of our Petitioners who were

g

prosecuted and on a first trial convicted of that

10

offense, but that conviction was reversed because of

11

discrimination in selection of the jury.

12

trial, the jury hung, so there was no jury verdict, and

13

neither the chancellor nor the Mississippi Supreme Court

14

made a finding that the three Petitioners, who of course

15

had denied in their trial any participation, had in fact

16

committed the act.

17

QUESTION:

On a second

Taking up your analogy to the

18

Boston Tea Party, if the London merchants could identify

19

only one of the members of the Boston Tea Party, but did

20

identify him, and demonstrated that he had damaged one

21

case of tea, could he be held, in your view, responsible

22

for all the loss of tea?

23

MR. CUTLER*

All the tea on the ship, yes.

24

think no question.

And indeed, you will find in the

25

papers of the First Continental Congress, in the

so-called Address to the British People which

2

accompanied the boycott resolution in the Continental

3

Association, a statement that the perpetrators of the

4

Boston Tea Party may have been guilty of a trespass, and

5

that the courts of Massachusetts Bay were open, but

6

instead of that, the British had responded by

7

restricting self-government in Massachusetts Bay and

8

passing the so-called Intolerable Acts.
QUESTION;

9

Mr. Cutler, how about the threats

10

of violence, if you trade with these stores, I will

break your neck, or beat you up, or whatever it is?
MR. CUTLER;

Let me come directly to that.

14

episodes.

15

see some of them are not violent at all, and the last of

16

them is the NAACP providing counsel to persons arrested

17

in the course of the boycott activity, but let's go

18

directly to the remark of Charles Evers, who was a

19

leader of the boycott, and an NAACP local secretary at

20

the time.

21

I will skip over the others of the 12

They are covered in our brief, and you will

22

the course of a long speech, "If we catch any of you

25

speech both in 1966, or that remark in 1966, when the

Some of the testimony places that

1

boycott began, and also in 1969, in a speech given two

2

days after the shooting of a black youth by a white

3

policeman that had caused great disturbances in the town.
There is no tape, film, or copy of that remark

4
5

or the speech in which Evers made it in the record, but

6

there is testimony, there is testimony, of course, as I

7

said, and Evers has admitted making the remark, and

8

Respondents have also relied on threats that they read

9

into another speecht that was given on April the 19th,

10

the night after the shooting of the black youth by the

11

white policeman, which is in the record, and on which

12

the Respondents now rely.
We urge you, Your Honors, to read that

13
14

speech.

15

catches the flavor and the currency of the moment, and

16

it graphically describes the grievances of the black

17

citizens of Claiborne County 13 years ago.

18

thrust was to persuade the crowd not to engage in

19

violent responses because of this shooting against the

20

"white brothers," as Evers called them, but to persevere

21

with the boycott.

22

It is at Page 85 of the Joint Appendix.

It

Its main

The remark, the 1969 one, at least, which is

23

the only one there is any real proof of, was made in the

24

emotional aftermath of the killing of that black youth

25

by a white policeman, and you will see from the speech

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that is in the record, how unjustified the black

2

community thought that shooting was, but most

3

importantly, Justice O'Connor, that there is no evidence

4

that either of these two speeches of Hr. Evers had any

5

effect on the boycott.
The two I am speaking of, April 19th and 21st,

6
7

1969, occurred three years after the boycott began and

8

after all the other eleven incidents described by the

9

chancellor had occurred.

They couldn't have led to

10

those incidents, and they couldn't have had a major

11

effect on the success of the boycott, which was already

12

three years old.
QUESTION:

13
14

Did the courts, state courts find

to the contrary?
HR. CUTLER:

15

The state court concluded that

16

the black people had believed Evers after quoting that

17

remark.

QUESTION:

MR. CUTLER:

HR. CUTLER:

Well, it made a finding of it.
I am not sure you could call it a

I would have to

concede that, but in support of mine, there were 20 -QUESTIONS

3

Well, your argument is, though,

4

that just on the record their conclusion is

5

unsupportable.
HR. CUTLER;

6

That is correct, but there is a

7

duty, I believe, to which Respondents agree in cases

8

like this for this Court to make an independent

9

examination of the record.
QUESTION;

10

Well, to what extent on a purely

11

factual issue should we go beyond the findings of two

12

courts?
MR. CUTLER;

13

I think in almost all of these

14

constitutional cases involving the exercise of First

15

Amendment rights, Justice Rehnguist, the Court, this

16

Court has gone into the record behind such findings, as

17

in Edwards against South Carolina, and both sides

18

conceded here that you should go into the record that

19

way .

20

What I want to point out is that 22 black

21

witnesses were called by the merchants and asked about

22

whether they had ever heard of the Evers remark about

23

breaking necks.

24

never heard of it at all, and six said they had heard of

25

it only in 1969, three years after the boycott began,

Sixteen of them said that they had

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and none of the many black witnesses called by these

2

merchants testified as to any fear of physical violence

3

because of the Evers speeches.
The Respondents have only cited to you four

4
5

instances in which anyone testified about fear of

6

punishment or discipline, and the context of at least

7

two of those statements shows that they were speaking of

8

fear of denunciation and ostracism.
QUESTION*

9

Nr. Cutler, what do you suppose our

10

standards for reviewing this constitutional fact should

11

be?

12

independent judgment of the record, or what?

if you took the 12 episodes on the face of what the two

courts below said about those episodes, the facts as

they described them, you cannot conclude that what is

described in those 12 episodes was pervasive or central

to the success of this boycott.

QUESTION*

Nr. Cutler, with reference to the

24

timing that you seem to emphasize so much, is it not

25

true that whether we look at the Boston Tea Party, or

situation like this, that there needs to be frequent

exhortation by those sponsoring the boycott, the

picketing, in order to keep it going?

Isn’t that a

normal part of the process.

none of us are trying to defend that.

MR. CUTLER;

There must have

To keep the boycott going, and

19

there is no doubt there were threats in the sense of

20

Justice Holmes* sense that whether a threat is unlawful

21

depends on what it is you threaten.

undoubtedly threats that if you went into the white

be denounced, and you would be socially ostracized.

We say that was precisely the

function of the Committees of Correspondence formed by

the First Continental Congress, and it was — it is so

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GROVER REES, III, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. REES:

6

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court, this is a dispute about the facts.

8

Because the facts are so important, I must deal at the

9

outset with a matter that I do not relish getting into.

10

Petitioners have made it an important part of

11

their case —
QUESTION:

12

Excuse me, Mr. Rees.

Is it a

13

dispute about the facts or about the meaning of the

14

facts ?
MR. REES:

15

Well, we believe it is a dispute

16

about the facts.

We believe it is also a dispute about

17

what the court found.

18

made a number of statements in their reply brief that

19

make it look as though we simply made false statements

20

about the facts and about what the courts found in our

21

briefs, particularly about the record.

22

deal with some of these matters in the argument, and if

23

the Court wishes to request a supplemental brief on

24

these new statements about what is in the record, we

25

would be very happy to supply one.

We believe that Petitioners have

Assuming that the Court does desire a

2

supplemental brief, though, we particularly urge you not

3

to rely on any of the Petitioners* assertions in the

4

reply brief that things are uncontradicted in the

5

record, because — because those things aren't

6

uncontradicted in the record.

7

that we said in our brief.

8
9

We stand by everything

Fortunately, most of the Petitioners'
assertions about the record are called into question by

10

a reading of the opinions below.

11

that the boycott was peaceful and voluntary, but the

12

state courts found that it was violent and coercive.

13

The Petitioners say that the NAACP never condoned

14

violence, there is nothing in the record to suggest that

15

they did, but the courts found that violence was in fact

16

promised by the field secretary of the NAACP and that

17

the black people of Port Gibson did not regard this as

18

harmless political hyperbole.

19

delivered before, during, and after the period of time

20

during which he made his statements.

QUESTION*

The Petitioners say

Violence was in fact

Is there some finding about how

many people heard about the field secretary's statements?
MR. REES;

The court did not engage in the

24

kind of factfinding that the Petitioners seem to think

25

that they had to engage in.

They didn't say, we find on

statements ?
MR. REES:

The statements that I think are

8

most relevant in the court opinion — You have 33 pages

9

that say the facts in the record.

There are many things

10

in there that I think are findings that they don't think

11

are findings, but the two most relevant statements are

12

that the field secretary of the NAACP promised physical

13

violence on at least two occasions, and that it is

14

evident that black people believed him.

not in the record.

QUESTION;

2
3

Mr. Sees, is it correct, though,

that at least one of those two statements was in 1969?

5

Unquestionably, the word got around —

MR. REES:
1969.

One was in 1966 and one was in

It said at least —

6

QUESTION:

Do you rely on the one in 1969?

7

MR. REES:

Yes, we do.

8

QUESTION:

For what?

9

MR. REES;

Well, first of all, we rely on it

10

as evidence to support the many other contentions in the

11

record, that when he said things like that people were

12

going to be disciplined, and when they were going to be

13

chastised, and so forth, that he didn’t mean that people

14

were going to come in the middle of the night and call

15

them bad names.

Secondly, this was an ongoing --

QUESTION;

16

Did the district court take the

17

view that that was enough?

18

theory of the case, as I understood it, that would have

19

been enough, that fear of denunciation and abuse of that

20

kind would have been enough to — all that they had to

21

prove.
MR. REES;

22

Under the district court's

I think that's true, because the

23

district court believed that a secondary boycott, even

24

though it is for political purposes, was enough for

25

liability.

Now —

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION;

So the district court did not have

2

to connect the violence, did not have to prove fear of

3

violence in order to sustain the judgment of —
MR. REES;

4
5

They didn’t have to, but they did.
QUESTION;

6
7

They made —

Does the 1969 statement — I don't

understand how you can rely on the 1969 statement then.
MR. REES;

8
9

No, they didn’t, but they did.

The problem is that as the Chief

Justice pointed out, there aren’t many times when the

10

leader of a group like this comes out and says, yes, I

11

am in favor of the violence, and we ought to go ahead

12

and do it, and there was testimony in the record from

13

other people, from witnesses, that they heard him say

14

that if you go into the stores, that you will be taken

15

care of, and you will be disciplined.
In his testimony he said, oh, we just meant we

16
17

were going to give them a good tongue-lashing, and the

18

Petitioners rely on that in their brief.
Now, I think that the state court used that

19

20

because it was the most vivid instance.

The boycott did

21

continue.

22

The fact that those particular 12 incidents — actually,

23

we count 15 in the trial court, in three pages of the

24

trial court’s opinion, happened before that are

25

irrelevant.

In fact, it intensified in April of 1969.

The court found that on many occasions

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

people's purchases were taken away from them, and so

2

forth, and this was an ongoing course.

3

The Patitioners would have you look only at

4

those three pages in the trial court opinion, and those

5

are the only evidentiary facts that they want to be

6

allowed to be supported, to be supportive of the

7

ultimate conclusion in the state supreme court's opinion

8

that there was the agreed use of violence.

9

that the proper standard of review is that the Court

We believe

10

should look at the whole record, should look at

11

everything to see if there was evidence from which a

12

reasonable trier of fact might have concluded the

13

conclusions that the state court in fact made.
»

14

You see, on the one hand, they say, well, this

15

is just anecdotal, and this is just sporadic, but on the

16

other hand, when the trial court ties it together and

17

says that unquestionably many black persons had their

18

volition overcome, and they were forced against their

19

personal wills not to trade with the white merchants,

20

they say, oh, well, there is really no evidence to

21

support that, because we can distinguish all of those

22

incidents.

12

We don't believe that is the proper standard

23

24

of review.

We do think that the threat is relevant both

25

in and of itself, because he did promise to deliver

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

violence, and that scared people.

2

continued, and it is our contention that if the design

3

of the boycott, if what the boycott was about was to

4

stop people from going in the stores because they were

5

scared that they would be beaten up and shot at and so

6

forth, that that is enough, and that continued after

7

April, 1969.
And we think it is also very relevant to show

8

9

The boycott

that when he said, for instance, earlier, he said, you

10

had better not bother to go get the sheriff, because the

11

sheriff can’t sleep with you at night, that he didn't

12

mean that the sheriff — that people were going to come

13

in the middle of the night and call people bad names.

14

He meant that bad, violent things were going to happen

15

to people.

16

that they would honor the boycott.

He was trying to instill fear in them, so

QUESTION;

17

Well, is it your position that by

18

whatever means, a boycott involves the sponsors of the

19

boycott putting fear into some people as a predicate for

20

damages?
MR. REES:

21

Well, actually, we don't believe

22

that.

They claim in their reply brief that we concede

23

that if it was a non-violent secondary boycott, that it

24

was protected First Amendment activity.

25

that the Boston — that’s not true.

We don't think

We don't concede

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that.

This Court's opinions, you’ve got different lines

2

of opinions that would suggest different results on that

3

issue.

4

suggest that this activity, picketing in support of a

5

secondary boycott, is something less than absolutely

6

protected First Amendment activity, because if you can

7

curtail that activity because it foments labor unrest,

8

which was the basis —

Certainly the labor secondary boycott opinions

9

QUESTION:

Even though not violent?

10

KR • REES:

Yes, even non-violent labor

11

picketing.

12

Court to reach that issue, because the state courts here

13

found that it was violent, and they found that the

14

violence was not sporadic, that it was — that it was

15

continuous, that it was pervasive.

16

We don't think that it is necessary for the

We think that if you read the 33 pages in the

17

trial court's opinion, where the judge says, these are

18

the statements, the facts in the record, is what it

19

says, that the trial judge would be very, very surprised

20

to learn that he didn't find that violence was central

21

to the success of the boycott.

22

QUESTION:

Well, he said, unquestionably, the

23

word got around that physical harm as well as

24

vilification and ostracism could very well be the lot of

25

any black person.

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. REESi

1

He also said that unquestionably,

2

in terms of the damage that was caused, he didn’t name

3

specific people who were frightened, but he said that

4

the evidence shows that the volition of many black

5

persons was overcome out of sheer fear, and they were

6

compelled against their personal wills to withhold their

7

trade and business intercourse from the complainants.

8

That is on Page 39-B, and that looks like a finding to

9

me.

10

The — the Petitioners’ contention that these

11

things aren’t findings really boil down to, as do all of

12

their other arguments, to the one argument that they

13

really have, which is that this was a civil rights

14

boycott, and civil rights boycotts are entitled to

15

strict scrutiny.

16

Petitioners’ case that strict scrutiny has replaced

17

banging on the table as what an advocate does when the

18

law is against him and the facts are against him.

19

this case, it doesn’t matter whether the obstacle they

20

are facing is the fact that the Court usually respects

21

the reasonable findings of state courts, or the rule

22

that in a civil case the preponderance of the evidence

23

is the test that is usually used, or the fact that

24

intent can be inferred from conduct, or the very limited

25

First Amendment protection to secondary picketing or to

I think it is evident from the

In

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

threats to break, people's necks.
In every one of those cases. Petitioners

2
3

remind this Court that this is a civil rights case, and

4

that there is no such thing as a fact or a finding or a

5

rule of law that can't be avoided by the application of

6

the right level of judicial scrutiny.
The problem that we find, the most serious

7

8

problem that we find with this contention is that

9

everybody who ever engages in any kind of concerted

10

action, whether it is labor unions or other political

11

groups whose goals are not the goals of the NAACP, or

12

anyone else, believes that he is fighting for his civil

13

rights.

14

that they are arguing for here, whether it is First

15

Amendment protection of certain kinds of threats or

16

whether it is ultra-strict standards of review where you

17

have to make the state courts say things in certain

18

words before you have a finding, those are not

19

susceptible of general application.

20

Now, the rules, the kinds of substantive rules

So if you hold for the Petitioners in this

21

case, the holding will have to rest not on what was done

22

but on the status of those who did it.

23

fact, we are the NAACP and we do not engage in violence,

24

we do not engage in constitutionally unprotected

25

conduct, and therefore the state courts must have been

wrong, and they suggest a number of devices, a number of

2

strict scrutiny devices, a number of extraordinary tests

3

for determining intent, and so forth, by which the Court

4

might reach that decision.

5

fail.

We think that they should

If the court, if the state courts were right

6
7

about the facts, then they were right about the law.

8

The First Amendment does protect advocacy of opinions.

9

It protects that advocacy no matter how controversial

10

the opinions are, no matter how vigorous the advocacy,

11

but it does not protect forceful and credible threats of

12

violence.

13

The fact that some of the Framers were willing

14

to countenance 14 or 15 months before the American

15

Revolution certain kinds of actions against the British,

16

indeed, some of them were willing to countenance the

17

Boston Tea Party itself, is no evidence that if you have

18

a Boston Tea Party, or that if you have something that

19

happened in 1773 against the British, that they intended

20

to constitutionalize that, that in 1979 and in 1866 they

21

intended to make that a binding rule on the states and

22

say, you can't prohibit this kind of activity, that is

23

not an adequate constitutional test.

24
25

The cases that are cited by Petitioners in
their brief, the Watts case, involved a highly

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

conditional, an expressly conditional threat to kill the

2

President, which was a highly improbable action.

3

was no evidence that the President had any reason to be

4

afraid that he was going to be killed.

5

Brandenberg case, you had 12 people out in the middle of

called revengence.

of stores and said, if you go in those stores, we are

kind of case that John Stuart Hill was talking about

when he said that an opinion that corn dealers are

starvers of the poor, or that private property is

robbery, ought to be unmolested when simply circulated

the 16,000-page record and find all the places that we

10

can find.

13

Well, it is a substantial task, but

I think it is counsel's task, not this Court's task.
MR. REES:

QUESTION;

16

So far, I get nothing but

17

generalities from your Mississippi courts and from your

18

brief, and I would like something specific.
MR. REES:

19

We will give it to you. Your

20

Honor.

In answer to the question about what the court

21

found, they did find that there was the agreed use of

22

illegal violence.

23

that they had performed an adequate review of the

24

record, and they dismissed 39 of the Petitioners.

25

Petitioners put themselves in the interesting position

Now, that is a conclusion.

They said

The

of saying that that means they didn’t search the record

2

because they granted the Petitioners’ motion to dimiss

3

all of those 39 people for the reasons that the

4

Petitioners said to dismiss them.

5

We don’t think that there should be any such

6

presumption, and we believe that they searched the

7

record.

8

Petitioners did was make in essence a bare no evidence

9

allegation.

We believe that if the Petitioners — what the

They said, all these — all these people

10

did was encourage other people to boycott or picket, and

11

they listed people without any reference, any record

12

references.

13

if they wanted to make a case to get this Court to

14

overrule the lower court finding, was to list every

15

reference to every petitioner in the record and what it

16

said, and then to conclude that there wasn’t enough

17

evidence.

18

should have done it in the first instance.

We believe that what they should have done

We will be glad to do that.

We think they

Charles Evers was liable for all the tea on
He did participate in threats of violence.

QUESTION:

Well, that was the whole object.

That was the whole object of the boycott, was it not?
HR. REES:

That’s right.

No, but he wanted to

11

do it by constitutionally unprotected means.

12

their contention is that if some people only wanted to

13

do it by protected means, then if it is a First

14

Amendment right to have a secondary boycott, they are

15

protected, and if it is a First Amendment right, and if

16

in fact there were people who were just out there

17

exercising their First Amendment rights, then they have

18

got a good case.

19

You see,

But Charles Evers wasn’t one of those people,

20

and Charles Evers was acting in his capacity as field

21

secretary of the NAACP.

23

ACLU recommends in their amicus brief, which is Section

Evers was responsible for all of the damage that the

2

people who were participating in this movement that he

was participating in did because he took himself out of

injured in the way that they were injured.

MR. REES:

Hell, but what I was -- the reason

13

that I think there’s a distinction is because the rule

14

of damages that the state courts and that courts

15

routinely apply that also reflects the rule in the

16

Restatement of Torts is the substantial factor test.

17

Now, there was only one boycott here.

There

18

was one set of damages.

19

you said to the state courts, you have to go back and

20

figure out how much damage there would have been if it

21

had been violent -- non-violent and peaceful and

22

voluntary instead of violent and coercive, is, you are

asking the courts to indulge in a hypothetical —

below was.

17

MR. REES:

I think that in that case, that if

18

there were a few people, and if they put on evidence

19

that — if they had put on evidence of the amount of --

20

the general damage was — there was one boycott, there

21

was one corpus of damages that would be very, very

22

difficult to sever, and in all the other cases that we

23

have been able to find, including the labor cases cited

24

by Petitioners, when that is the case, there is no

25

requirement that the courts sever the damages.

In the Mead case that we cite in our brief,

the court says, the requirement that something have

prevent windfall recoveries.

5

QUESTION;

So if it is 10 percent caused by

6

violence and 90 percent voluntarily, I suppose 10

7

percent is substantial and material, then they are 100

percent liable.

MR. REES;

I think it might be.

There were some people, and they cite in their

their names called out, or they basically agreed with

the boycott, then the same witness in another place in

his testimony — frequently these were the Petitioners

themselves -- they said, oh, yes, I was afraid.

9

the people who said that — who the Petitioners cite as

One of

11

name called out and being embarrassed also says that she

12

had heard that people had been physically -- she had

13

heard that they would take your packages away from you

and destroy them, and she didn’t want that to happen to

her.

hand, in a case where — for instance, the Ramsey case,

5

where this Court held that you can prove conspiracy, you

6

can prove an implied conspiracy in a labor context by a

7

preponderance of the evidence, that you can draw

8

inferences from conduct, which is how the conspiracy was

9

found here.

10

On the other

In that case, they say, well, that is a

labor case, not a civil rights case.
Now, it is exactly the other way.

11

They’ve got

12

it exactly backwards.

13

substantive or a procedural protection for labor unions

14

that is not reguired by the First Amendment, you can’t

15

use that as though it were a First Amendment case, and

16

that is what they try to do on this damages issue.

17

the other hand, when this Court holds that something is

18

permitted, that conduct can be penalized in a labor

19

context, it strikes me that the burden is on the people

20

who are trying to distinguish that case to come up with

21

a distinction, and I don’t think it is enough just to

say that this is a civil rights case.

MR. CUTLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, the chancello

of the trial court found that Claiborne County had a

white, and the chancellor used that to deduce that the
white merchants were especially vulnerable to a
boycott.

So it is 7,500 people who were supposed to

have been intimidated by violence and threats of
violence in order to make this boycott the success that
both courts below found it was.
The theory of the trial was to call, in
addition to the sheriff, a series of black persons, and
to ask them whether they were intimidated, and whether
they had heard of particular acts of violence, or
whether they had been victims of acts of violence, and
as I mentioned to you earlier, in the Mississippi
Supreme Court, these Respondents said, and this is in

51

our reply brief, most of the witnesses that they
themselves had called testified they voluntarily went
along with the NAACP and their fellow black citizens in
honoring and observing the boycott because they wanted
the boycott.
And regardless of how one might read this
record, the way the Mississippi Supreme Court read the
record citing the 12 episodes that I have referred to,
including the Evers threat, was that violence was force,
violence, and threats, and the word "threats" is
ambiguous because it may also refer, as some of the
witnesses said, to threats of denunciation and
ostracism, but taken even as threats of physical
violence, were present during the boycott.
the theory.

Present is

If it is present, that is enough on a

conspiracy theory.

And that this presence was "part of

the boycott activity" that contributed to the boycott's
success.
So, on the words of the Mississippi Supreme
Court, there is nothing like a finding that violence was
pervasive or that it accounted for all the success or
even most of the success.

It was part of the activity

that contributed to the success.
On the question of parsing out which parts of
a mixture of lawful conduct and unlawful conduct have to

52
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

be separated in assessing causation and damages, in
constitutional cases, this Court has been very clear
several times that it is the duty of the trial court to
separate those factors out.

In Pennington, you sent the

case back because there was a mixture of an antitrust
/■

conspiracy to put the small coal mine operators out of
business, and protected lobbying efforts to get the
Secretary of Labor to establish a regulation that would
help put them out of business.

You said no damages

could be assessed for the protected effort.
In Gibbs, Mr. Justice Brennan announced a
similar rule because there the damage had resulted in
part from legitimate protected picketing activity and in
part from improper activity.
In Berkey, an antitrust case that the Second
Circuit has just decided, deciding a number of your
cases, they separated out damage to an antitrust
plaintiff to distinguish between the effects of
legitimate competition and the effects of the unlawful
act.

It is a perfectly standard way of going about this

sort of a problem.
I had thought the issue of primary and —
whether this was a primary or secondary boycott was out
of the case and that if peaceful, the Respondents did
not challenge it.

I take it now the Respondents

you in that connection about Thornhill against Alabama,

which expressly protects primary boycotts and picketing

with the purpose and effect of persuading people in a

labor dispute not to patronize the employer.
And in Alabama against NAACP, Justice Harlan

said for this Court that when Alabama tried to throw the

9

NAACP out of Alabama for a series of alleged unlawful

10

acts, including the boycott of the Montgomery busing

11

system, he said that even if one assumed that such an

12

act, a boycott could be validly — could be charged as

13

unconstitutional under a valid statute, he expressed

,4

great doubts as to whether that could be done, that you

15

could not have a valid statute in those circumstances.

Thornhill.

because it was a labor dispute and you recognized the

against all the products of a neutral employer.

Secondary boycotts, you have protected in

much of the loss of business was caused by the act of

violence, and as Justice Brennan hypothesized in the

Gibbs case, if you've got a situation as grave as

Meadowmore, where violence was in fact pervasive, a jury

could conceivably find, or a factfinder could find that

all of the damage resulted from the violence.
