ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK A. SANDBERG, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

7

MR. SANDBERG:

8

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

9

This is an appeal from a decision of the Alaska

Thank you.

10 Supreme

Court.

That decision declared constitutional a

11 statute

which distributes income from Alaska's permanent

12 fund based solely on the duration of the residency of the
13 recipient.
14

The fund itself was set up in

15 respository

for surplus revenues.

16 after the fund was created,

1976 as a

In 1980, some four years

this statute was passed, and it

17 proposes to allocate one-half of the income of the fund.
18 is this statute and

It

not the existence of the fund itself

19 which the Appellants challenge.
20

The case is unlike every other durational

21 residency case which has come before this Court.

In those

22 cases the durational residency requirement was being used as
23 a test:

it was being used as a test of domicile.

24 Appellants are unquestioned
25 used as a test.

Alaskans.

Here it's simply being used to assign legal

QUESTION;

Mr. Sandberg, a couple of questions to

3

straighten me out.

4

state has been paying out, in effect issuing a dividend to

5

residents?

Do you know of any other case where a

6

MR. SANDBERG;

7

QUESTION;

8 for five years and

No, sir, I do not.

And suppose a ten-year resident leaves
then come backs.

9

all over again under your system?

10

MR. SANDBERG;

11 regulations

Would he have to start

Well, there's a series of

that have been promulgated, and I forget

12

precisely what they say, but there's a formula which would,

13

I believe -- and Mr. Gross will correct me if I am wrong --

14

but I believe that he would basically pick up where he left

15

off, but he certainly would not get credit for the time he

16

was away.

17

QUESTION;

If Alaska paid an equal dividend -- I

18

call it that; it's in quotation marks -- to every resident,

19

you wouldn't be here.

20

MR. SANDBERG;

21 other words,

That is true.

That is true.

In

this case, although I have personal doubts

22 about the wisdom or

validity of giving money away to begin

23

with, that's not what this case is about.

24

argued that, and we've not attempted to present that issue.

25

QUESTION;

And we haven't

And may an Alaska resident qualify even

2

MR. SANDBERG;

3

QUESTION;

That’s right.

And if a young man were 18 now would he

4 qualify even though he never voted?
5

MR. SANDBERG;

6

QUESTION;

That’s right.

So that a family of five would get five

7 shares based on their respective units,
8

MR.

SANDBERG;

That’s right.

A family of five

9 would, as long as they were all adults — children are not
10 included in the plan -- but as long as they were all adults,
11 a family of five would accrue five separate shares.
12

QUESTION;

Children are not included then.

13

MR. SANDBERG;

That’s right.

No one under 18

14 participates in the plan.
15

QUESTION;

What if one became 18 two years ago.

16 would he have two units?
17

MR. SANDBERG;

No.

He would have 20, but he would

1 mean anything, they must mean that a state is not free to
2 hand a new migrant a number at the border and say here, this
3 number is going to determine your legal status in our local
4 tax system for as long as you remain here.
5

Durational residency requirements are sometimes

6 permissible as a test of the bona fides of a claim of state
7 citizenship, but the constitutional minimum has to be that
8 at some point the test is over.

At some point the new

9 resident has to acquire full, equal and undifferentiated
10 citizenship the same as all other citizens of the state
11 possess.
12

That very point was recognized by this Court 110

13 years ago in the Slaughterhouse cases when the Court
14 observed that the 14th Amendment itself created a
15 substantive federally guaranteed right to become a citizen
16 of any state through bona fide residence with the same
17 rights as other citizens of that state.
18

The Constitution doesn't allow a state to have

19 classes of citizens.

Ranking the citizenry based upon when

20 they acquired their citizenship we believe is a direct
21 infringement on the right of interstate migration.
22

QUESTION:

What about classes of citizens who are

23 denied their right to vote because of felony convictions?

24

HR. SANDBERG:

Well, this Court has obviously

25 dealt with that question on a number of occasions, and it

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 has

as I recall, what it said was that the 14th Amendment

2 expressly allowed that.

Here there's no analogous

3 provision, we believe.
4

QUESTION;

So your statement isn’t categorically

5 true.
6

MR. SANDBERG;

That's correct.

We certainly don't

7 believe that this is a permissible classification of
8 citizens, though.

It is true that felons do indeed enjoy

9 less civil rights than other people.
10

QUESTION;

Counsel, is it your position that if

11 the

period of time were, let's say, a year before one could

12 get

the full amount, that that would be a reasonable time

13 and therefore a valid provision?
14

MR. SANDBERG;

Is that your position?

I think that's right.

We're not

15 questioning the state's ability to impose a waiting period
16 as one element of proving domicile.
17

QUESTION;

How long?

18

MR. SANDBERG;

Well, that in itself is a

19 constitutional question, and that’s the question that we
20 believe Shapiro and Maricopa County and Sosna
21

QUESTION;

22 that might be all

23

were about.

Thirty days, sixty days, something like

right?

MR. SANDBERG;

That's right.

And in fact, the

24 cases certainly seem to suggest that perhaps up to a year
25 depending on the nature of the individual interest and the

7

1

state interest being asserted.

2

QUESTION*

What was the time in Shapiro against

3 New York?

MR. SANDBERG*

4

5 struck down

there.

6

QUESTION*

7

MR. SANDBERG*

8

QUESTION*

9

MR. SANDBERG*

10 right,
11

Well, it was a year, which was

One year.
Yes.

So one year was too much.
For the welfare interest, that's

because that was a significant individual interest.

In other cases the Court, for example, has suggested that a

12 year might be appropriate for higher education.

QUESTION*

3

Mr. Sandberg, I think I heard you say

4 that you thought this whole case was settled by a sentence
5 in the
6

14th Amendment.

Which sentence?

MR. SANDBERG*

The first sentence.

The first

7 sentence of the

14th Amendment creates the right to be a

8 state citizen.

It's a federally secured right.

9 sentence was intended
20 people citizens of
21

22

That

to overrule Dread Scott and make

the state in which they resided, as a

matter of federal law.
QUESTION*

It went a little further.

23 was only about Negroes, but

Dread Scott

the 14th Amendment brought

24 everybody in.
25

MR. SANDBERG*

That certainly is our view of the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, O.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 situation, and that's the way the law's developed.
2

QUESTION:

Everybody got citizenship at the same

3 time.
4

ME. SANDBERG:

That's right.

And the citizenship

5 which the 14th Amendment granted in our opinion is the same
6 citizenship that was enjoyed by persons who were able to
7 claim citizenship without reference to the 14th Amendment
8 before its passage.
9

QUESTION:

Yes, but your Slaughterhouse cases also

10 said this only applied to the newly freed slaves.
11

ME. SANDBERG:

12

QUESTION:

Which you think was wrong.

13

QUESTION:

You have to.

14

MR. SANDBERG:

15

QUESTION:

16 amendment:

Nell, that's --

Of course I think that'swrong.

How about the second sentence of the

"Nor shall any state deprive any person of life,

17 liberty or property."

Does that give you any help or

18 support?
19

MR. SANDBERG:

We have not specifically advocated

20 that as a basis, and I guess I honestly would have to
21 concede that I don't know.
22

QUESTION:

Do you make an equal protection

23 argument?
24

MR. SANDBERG:

25

QUESTION:

Yes, we do.

So you do rely on that last clause.

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

HE. SANDBERG;

That’s right

We say that this is

2 a substantive violation of the right to acquire citizenship,
3 and we also say it is a fundamental right strand of equal
4 protection case.
5

QUESTION:

Well, can’t it be argued that this is a

6 classical case for the application of Justice Brandeis’
7 doctrine in Newstate Ice versus Liebman; that we have now 50
8 experimental laboratories, and Alaska has now a very
9 peculiar situation which has existed since the time of the
10 Klondike days where there have been tremendous resources
11 that have just been squandered away, and they are now making
12 an effort to preserve them, and they should be given some
13 latitude in experimentation?
14

MR. SANDBERG:

Well, we think the Constitution

15 can't be different from state to state, and we think that
16 while the state puts this forth as a revolutionary new idea
17 in government, we think it's a very old idea in government.
18 We think the idea that some people have superior legal
19 rights over others is as old as kings and pharoahs.

We

20 think it’s a converse idea, that all citizens are equal,
21 which is truly revolutionary.
22

QUESTION;

Do you think this is comparable to a

23 statute which would provide that the people in this
24 preferred class would pay taxes according to the length of
25 time they lived in the state; in other words, the old

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 residents would pay half as much as the newcomers?
2

MR. SANDBERG:

Me began this lawsuit by filing

3 against two statutes, and the first of them was almost
4 analogous to the hypothetical which you suggested, and that
5 was struck down on state equal protection grounds.

And so

6 yes, I certainly think that would be analogous to this.
7

QUESTION:

This is sort of an anticipatory refund,

8 isn't it, in your view?
9

MR. SANDBERG:

I suppose that's right.

What it

10 really is in our view is a way of rewarding long-term
11 residents simply for being long-term residents, and we
12 believe that that's constitutionally impermissible.

And

13 while the state does assert that it serves various other
14 purposes, in our view -- certainly I would never say that I
15 don’t believe that, but what I would say is that it's
16 remarkable that it serves those only indirectly, but it's
17 perfectly fitted to an impermissible purpose, and that's
18 recognizing past contributions of the citizenry.
19

QUESTION:

Mr. Sandberg, I don't understand why

20 the first sentence of the
21 question.

14th Amendment answers the

I gather the one-year resident of the state is

22 just as much a citizen of the state by force of that first
23 sentence as is the ten-year resident of the state, isn't he?
24

MR. SANDBERG:

I'm sorry.

The one-year resident,

25 if you imposed the one-year waiting requirement?

1 1

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION ;

No, no, no

Under the statute I gather

2 a one-year resident gets less of a bonus or whatever this
3 proper label is than does the ten-year resident, but the
4 one-year resident is just as much a citizen of Alaska as is
5 the ten-year resident, is he not?
6

MR. SANDBERG;

It's true that he has a driver's

7 license and he votes, but he certainly has less legal
8 rights, and he has less legal rights purely -9

QUESTION;

No.

He simply doesn't get as much of

10 this largesse as does the ten-year resident, isn't that it?
11

MR. SANDBERG;

He has less legal rights purely

12 because of when he acquired his citizenship.

And thus we

13 think you have to do more than call someone a citizen;

we

14 think you have to treat them like one.
15

QUESTION;

Well, the theory of your case is the

16 combination of the first sentence and the last, is it not?
17

MR. SANDBERG;

18

QUESTION;

That's right.

That once he's a citizen he may not or

19 she may not be treated in any way different from any other
20 citizen, whether it's on the tax rate imposed or receiving
21 this bonus,
22

as Justice Brennan called it.

MR. SANDBERG;

Well, one citizen may certainly be

23 treated differently from another when judged by neutral
24 criteria and unrelated to the quality of their citizenship.
25 For example,

I'm not standing here telling the Court that if

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 one person gets welfare, everybody's got to get welfare;
2 neither certainly a neutral criterion unrelated to the
3 quality of one's citizenship.
4

But what I am saying is that once a person is a

5 citizen, once they've satisfied a waiting requirement and
6 the test is over, then they cannot be ranked on the basis of
7 the quality of their citizenship or when they acquired it.
8

QUESTION:

In the voting area you wouldn't go for

9 giving a 15-year resident 15 votes and a one-year resident
10 one vote.
11

HE. SANDBERG:

Obviously not.

12

This Court has repeatedly rejected the idea that a

13 state is free to distinguish between new and old residents
14 in its consistent rejection of the contribution rationale.
15

QUESTION:

Kr. Sandberg, I think your clients came

16 into your state in 1978.
17

MR. SANDBERG:

18

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Would you be making the same arguments

19 if your clients had come into the state in 1975 or 1972?
20

MR. SANDBERG:

They would certainly have standing

21 to file that claim.
22

QUESTION:

What would be the difference between

23 your position if you were representing the earlier arrivals
24 and the position you take here today?
25

MR. SANDBERG:

It would be no different, in my

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 opinion.
2

QUESTION;

And the same would be true if you went

3 back to someone who had been there, what, 18 years?
4

MR. SANDBERG;

Well, at least theoretically the

5 class is everyone other than the people who were there in
6 1959, but as a practical matter it's perhaps like a
7 reapportionment case that a person at some level achieves
8 enough so that he doesn’t want to rock the boat.

You may

9 not live in the most overrepresented district, but you don't
10 want to file the lawsuit either.
11

QUESTION;

Well, this emphasizes the first

12 statement you made that this is entirely different from any
13 durational residency case we've had.
14

MR. SANDBERG;

That's right, because a durational

15 residency requirement here is a lifetime.

As long as

16 someone's alive in the state of Alaska who got there before
17 my clients did, they will never achieve the maximum benefit
18 under this plan.
19

So the waiting period here is forever.

QUESTION:

But there is no more penalty imposed on

20 your client in terms of theory than imposed on any resident
21 who came in subsequent to the first year.
22

MR. SANDBERG;

23

QUESTION;

That's right.

Well, and as long as someone is alive

24 who arrived before your clients did, they will be paying
25 more taxes to Alaska than your clients will, will they not?

3

QUESTION:

This Court has not always applied the

4 same test, has it, in determining the validity of durational
5 residence requirements; in other words, a strict scrutiny
6 versus some other level of examination?
7

MR. SANDBERG:

8

QUESTION:

That's correct.

And where do you think this case ought

9 to fit in the level of scrutiny?
10

MR. SANDBERG:

I think that once the state goes

11 beyond imposing a waiting period -- well, first of all, let
12 me address the waiting period.
13

When you have a waiting period, I think it may be

14 appropriate to have a penalty-type analysis or a weighing of
15 competing interests to see how long the waiting period could
16 be; but once you go beyond the waiting period and start
17 classifying people who are unquestionably citizens based
18 solely on when they acquired their citizenship, then I think
19 you ought to demonstrate a compelling interest for doing
20 tha t.
21

QUESTION:

What about age, Mr. Sandberg?

Suppose

22 a state in its income tax setup gave someone over 70 a
23 special exemption.
24

Is that valid or invalid?

MR. SANDBERG:

Oh, I think that's valid, but that

25 has nothing to do with our case as long as they gave it to

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 everyone in the state who was over 70 without regard to when
2 they got there.

Then that's simply a regular,

3 straightforward equal protection case concerning age
4 discrimina tion ; and in my view that particular exemption
5 would be valid.
6

QUESTION*

Well, they're giving this to every

7 resident of the state.
8

It just differs as to amount.

MR. SANDBERG*

Well, it's quite true, and the

9 state does argue that everyone participates in the plan;
10 therefore, it must be all right.

I've heard them make that

11 argument, but to my way of thinking that's sort of like
12 saying Plessey vs. Ferguson there was no problem because
13 everybody rode the train.
14

The real question is not does everyone participate

15 in the program.

It's how do we divide up the participants.

16 And the way they're being divided up here is a way which we
17 suggest is offensive.
18

QUESTION:

That's why you rest on your equal

19 protection argument.
20

MR. SANDBERG*

21

The state advances two purposes in its brief

22 here:

That's right.

stabilizing the population and conserving the fund.

23 We believe that neither of those may fairly be deemed
24 compelling, but interestingly enough, neither of them are
25 even rationally related to the retrospective features of

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 this plan.

In other words, awarding for past residents,

2 residents since 1959 -3

QUESTION*

4 "compelling."

Mr. Sandberg, you used the word

Does this answer Justice O'Connor’s question

5 to you earlier?

The level of scrutiny should be compelling

6 state interest?
7

MB. SANDBERG*

8

QUESTION*

9

MR. SANDBERG*

That's correct.

To justify this.
Yes.

I think the state should have

10 to demonstrate a compelling state interest to justify this
11 sort of a classification.
12

QUESTION;

What is your definition of a compelling

13 state interest?
14

MR. SANDBERG*

Well, certainly one that's more

15 significant than stabilizing the population.
16

QUESTION;

17 isn't it?
18

I think it’s --

Well, it's one that compels a result,

Aren't we -MR. SANDBERG;

It's where the state is really left

19 with no choice, in my opinion.
20

QUESTION;

Sure.

21

MR. SANDBERG*

But the only purpose which

22 plausibly explains the 1959 date and the retrospective

QUESTION;

Mr. Sandburg, following up on your

3 suggestion that there might be a distinction between
4 prospective and retrospective application, would you say
5 that it was irrational if the program were purely
6 prospective and said after the date of enactment, in order
7 to encourage people to reside in the state, we will have
8 this bonus for long-time residents?
9

ME. SANDBERG;

No.

I think if the plan began in

10 1980 and ran forward and the appropriate level of review was
11 minimum rationality, which I certainly don't think it is;
12 but if that was the appropriate level of review, then I
13 probably wouldn't be here.

In the end this plan is going to stand or fall on

3 whether I can convey to you the rationality of the dividend
4 distribution system that's used in the plan; and that
5 dividend distribution system is just a part of an overall
6 plan that the State of Alaska is using to deal with

a very

7 unusual and unique problem.
8

We have a great deal of temporary oil wealth in

9 the State of Alaska.
10 for

The state has been poverty-stricken

literally hundreds of year, and we now have, because of

11 the fortuity of oil being discovered on

state land,

a

12 temporary influx of a great deal of money.

13

QUESTION;

14

MR. GROSS;

Is it on state land or federal land?
It's on state land, primarily the land

15 in Prudhoe Bay.
16

QUESTION;

17

22 it?

23

MR. GROSS;

No.

24 talking 20 to 30 years.

Temporary is very quick.

We're

That's a popular, I think,

25 misconception, but the field depletes at something like the

20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 rate of one percent every 60 days.

And there have been no

2 other major oil finds in the State of Alaska, so we are
3 dealing with a resource which for a short period of time
4 will produce several billions of dollars for the state -5 it's like the gold at the turn of the century -- but then
6 will be gone, forever.
7

And what we are talking about is a system which

8 will avoid repeating Alaska’s past, which is great periods
9 of wealth and then total deprivation thereafter.
10

Now, to do that -- I should say that our early

11 start at this problem was not very successful.

The state

12 had its first and most major oil lease sale in 1969.

It

13 collected from that sale $900 million in a state that had a
14 budget at the time of roughly $150 million per annum.

And

15 within six years the money was all gone, and government
16 programs which had been established by legislators who were
17 interested in both the pressing needs of the state and their
18 own political futures were running out of funds.

The state

19 was on the edge of bankruptcy.
20

What happened then was, of course, that finally

21 the oil money started to come in again, primarily through
22 the construction of the pipeline; and now we are faced with
23 the same problem:

a temporary influx of oil dollars, and

24 the problem is how to make them last.
25

Now, to do that we have embarked on a rather

21

in Alaska.

2 Governor proposed,

It's never been tried before.

The

and the legislature eventually adopted,

3 and the people overwhelmingly passed a constitutional
4 amendment establishing what has been referred to as the
5 Permanent Fund.
6

The constitutional amendment provided that at

7 least 25 percent of the bonuses and royalties from oil
8 be placed in this fund.

The fund itself may not be

9 appropriated for any purpose by the legislature.

The only

is the interest from the fund.

11

Now, of course, that does two things.

12

QUESTION;

14

MR. GROSS;

15 from the fund.

I don’t believe the state may borrow

The fund can certainly be invested in

16 certain programs.
17

QUESTION;

18

MR. GROSS;

19

QUESTION;

20 which would

Can the fund be invested?
Yes.
Can it be invested in state bonds,

be another way of putting the same question.

21

MR. GROSS;

22

The creation of the fund does two things.

23 of all,

To my knowledge, no. Justice Burger.
First

of course it saves a portion of the money for the

24 future, 25 percent at a minimum.

But more important, it

25 transforms a finite resource into an infinite source of

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 revenue.

By restricting the legislature to the use only of

2 the interest on the fund, that interest can continue in
3 perpetuity, at least in theory; so that government programs
4 constructed on it, social programs and the like, can
5 continue long after the oil is gone.

Public expectations

6 will be based not on the principle of the fund because that
7 is not appropriated.
8

QUESTION;

Well, I assume you're going to relate

9 that program to this issue.
10

MR. GROSS;

Yes, I am.

11

Now, when you set that up, it creates an immediate

12 public and a political conflict.

Yes, I am.

On the one hand you have

13 the legislature which is faced with rather pressing public
14 needs, to say nothing of their own political futures, faced
15 with large infusions of oil wealth.

They have use of 75

16 percent of all the oil wealth that comes in, plus the
17 interest from the 25 percent that goes into the Permanent
18 Fund.

And on the other hand there is the public interest in

19 trying to preserve as much as this oil wealth for the long
20 term as humanly possible.
21

Now, it’s easy to see the political pressures on

22 the legislature to spend the money; we're all familiar with
23 those.

Eut there was no countering political pressure for

24 the legislature to increase the payments into the Permanent
25 Fund, to put more than the 25 percent mandated by the

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 constitutional amendment, and to put more of the oil money
2 in there to be saved for future generations.
3

So the Governor proposed what is I call a unique

4 program, but it's perfectly tailored to this situation.

He

5 suggested that since the residents of the state owned the
6 resources, owned the oil resources, that to the extent that
7 oil revenues placed in the Permanent Fund produced income,
8 interest which was surplus to present government needs, that
9 those monies should be distributed directly to the people.
10

Now, it's immediately obvious that when you do

11 that two things happen.

The first of all is that since the

12 people will receive dividends directly and only from
13 interest within the Permanent Fund, on monies placed in the
14 Permanent Fund, it puts enormous pressure on the legislature
15 to put as much money in the Permanent Fund as possible.

Now

16 people have a personal interest in seeing the Permanent Fund
17 maximized, because they will receive greater dividends the
18 more and more money is placed in the Permanent Fund.
19

And the second thing it does is that it creates in

20 Alaska the type of check on political spending which is
21 present in every other state but not present in ours.

For

%

22 instance, in Kansas if you want to establish a government
23 program, you have to tax for it.

You have to impose a tax

24 on the people, and it better be a good government program or

25 you better not impose the tax.

There’s a political debit to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 meet the political credit.
2

In Alaska since the legislature can simply fund

3 government programs through the sale of oil leases, which
4 people are sufficiently remote from that they do not really
5 consider their own, that when you transform those oil leases
6 and the money from them into the Permanent Fund and say to
7 the people there’s going to be money produced from this oil,
8 now, if it's surplus to the government needs it will be
9 distributed to you in some form, and on the other hand the
10 legislature can spend it.
11

Sow, the legislature is free to spend it --

MR. GROSS*

I'm suggesting that there is a clear

2 public purpose for the distribution of the dividends in the
3 first place.

Now, the question -- I tried to establish that

4 because once you get to that point, Justice Marshall, then
5 you are trying to determine how to distribute the dividends,
6 what is the best manner in which to distribute the
7 dividends, certainly consistent with the 14th Amendment.
8 Alaska has no exemption from the 14th Amendment, nor do we
9 claim it.
10

Now, in distributing the dividends the legislature

11 selected a system whereby they tried to make the individual
12 interest in receipt of the dividends identical with the
13 public interest in maintaining a long-term and healthy
14 Permanent Fund.
15

Now, let me take, for example, Justice Marshall,

16 you suggest the 14th Amendment applies, and I would suggest,
17 of course, that the
18

14th Amendment -I don’t suggest it.
I agree with you.

I insist.
The 14th Amendment

20 requires, of course, that classifications be rational and
21 rationally related to valid public purposes.
22

Now, I’ve talked about the public purpose.

Now,

23 let’s think for a moment about how these dividends could be
24 distributed.

I don’t think that the 14th Amendment requires

25 necessarily that everyone be treated identically.

The

But at the same time

What we're talking about is

5 are

the distinctions made in this dividend plan rational or

6 are

they not rational.

7

Now, let's take a perfectly equal distribution for

8 a moment.

Suppose the state determined to distribute

9 dividends one to each

resident each year regardless of how

10

long they had lived in the state.

11

it's, I think, immediately obvious that, to every resident,

12 that as

So if the feeling is that as more

2 share will decrease, I think it's fairly obvious -3

QUESTION*

Are you saying that one of the purposes

4 of the plan is to discourage people from coming to Alaska?
5

MS. GROSS*

6

QUESTION;

No, not at all.
Well, it seems to me that's what you're

7 arguing.
8

MR. GROSS*

No, no.

I said the purpose of the

9 plan, Justice Stevens, is first of all to provide -- of
10 dividends at all -- is to provide an incentive for the
11 legislature to put a maximum amount of money in the
12 Permanent Fund and to provide a check on legislative
13 expenditure of the oil money.
14

Now, once you have done that, once you have

15 decided that the issuance of dividends is for a valid public
16 purpose, what you are doing is using people's personal
17 desire to get the money as opposed to be using for a
18 government program, let's say, as an incentive to accomplish
19 this fact.
20

All right.

You've done that.

Now, if you take

21 the dividends and you distribute them on a per capita basis
22 each year, having nothing to do with the length of residency
23 in the state, each person, what you have is a situation

24 where people's psychology, the very incentive that you're
25 using here -- personal desire to get the money -- isn't

1 going to take long that the more people that come, the less
2 they're going to take.
3

Now, they can't stop people from coming, nor is

4 there any desire to stop people from coming.

But when you

5 do that, it's going to create some other pressures.

It's

6 going to create, for instance, pressures on the legislature
7 to get the maximum money not only in the Permanent Fund but
8 out of the Permanent Fund as quickly as possible; because if
9 they get it now, they don't have to worry about sharing it
10 with five million people who will come to Alaska in ten
11 years or twenty years.
12

Now, if you're saying that, you know, people

13 shouldn't think this way, you may have a point; but I think
14 individuals do think this way when they're looking at money
15 that they're going to receive.
16 dealing with is people.

So I think that what you're

You would create by distributing

17 dividends in a purely per capita fashion, you would create

If the plan is constitutional vis-a-vis

So far as the feature of people participating in

No, it would not be.

If it were a

Okay.
That’s what this case is about --

You started off by saying you were loaded with cash.
MR. GROSS;

I think this case, Justice Marshall,

8 is about the participation in a plan where everyone has
9 equal rights to receive the same amount of cash over the
10 same period of residency for certain valid public purposes.
11 That 's what the case is about.
12

If you want to look at it on a one-year basis,

13 yes , people get different amounts of cash, just as under
14 welfare systems people get different amounts of welfare
15 depending upon how they meet the criteria.

find if it's a

16 valid public purpose for giving some amount of welfare to
17 one person and some to another, that's perfectly valid.
18

And the basic issue here is whether the criteria

19 made in the length of residency to accomplish a valid public
20 purpose is in fact rational.

If it is not — and I gather

QUESTION:

The purpose — is one of the purposes

I would say it differently.

MR. GROSS;

5 to turn that around,

I suppose that's true.

6

And does that fly in the face of any

MR. GROSS;

I don't believe so, Justice O'Connor,

9 any more than if one state,

for instance, say one state has

11 system.

You could say --

MR. GROSS;

Or an old age pension ?
Exactly, y es.

14 desirable to stay in that state

That makes it so

that you don't want to leave

15 that state and go to another state.

I think that would be

16 opening a can of worms which has never yet been opened by
17 the Court.

It would put states in relative -- you know, any

18 good program would be considered constraining the right of
19 migration from the state.
20

But there's no impact, Justice O’Connor, on the

21 rights of migration

QUESTION;

I think that's --

Suppose Alaska wanted to encourage

23 people to come there and passed a statute that for the first
24 five years of your residence a new resident

Do you think that would pass muster?

MR. GROSS;

To encourage immigration, in essence?

3 I suppose the public purpose to encourage immigration -- I
4 don't really know, Justice Burger.
5 has done that.

I don't think any state

It has done it with corporations, of course;

6 and states do provide tax incentives to corporations.

I

7 don't know of any state that's ever done it for people.
8

QUESTION;

Corporations are persons under the

14th

9 Amendment.
10

MR. GROSS;

It's true.

I mean, if you take the

11 analogy through, I assume states could do it, but I know of
12 no case that that's ever been tried.
13

QUESTION;

Has this Court ever passed on the

14 corporate -- the constitutionality of these corporate
15 benefits?
16

MR. GROSS;

Well, the Court has certainly

17 established the widest possible latitude for states in
18 dealing with tax exemptions, and I assume that’s that sort
19 of a tax -- if the state determined that it was in the
20 public interest to encourage new business to come to the
21 state, I assume it could make that sort of exemption; but
22 I'm not aware of any case which has been specifically on
23 that point.

No.

finy more than there would be to

6 any other state benefits a state would be giving out to
7 people that would be rationally supported.

I mean certainly

8 a person that receives old age benefits from a state pays
9 less income tax in toto than someone who does not, but
10 because the program is rational and valid, that simply is
11 what happens.

It's not a constitutional issue over that.

12 It doesn’t result in the income tax being graduated on the
13 basis of age.
14

QUESTION*

But you wouldn’t distribute old age

15 benefits in accordance with residency duration, would you?
16

MR. GROSS*

No, you wouldn’t.

I'm saying that

17 therefore -- I mean, you have to determine the
18 constitutionality of this program in and by itself.

Should

19 you determine that it is constitutional, just as you were
20 determining that old age benefits were constitutional, once
21 you reach that conclusion, the fact that you subsequently
22 impose an income tax wouldn't make it unconstitutional any
23 more than you could say that the income tax was based on age
24 in comparison with old age benefits.

I mean, people who

25 received old age benefits pay less tax, but that, you know

40

QUESTION;

3 rational basis test.

Mr. Gross, you keep referring to a
What if the Court has to apply a

4 stricter scrutiny to a durational residence scheme such as
5 Alaska's ?
6

MR. GROSS;

Durational residency, at the outset,

7 Justice O'Connor, I think has been only used by this Court,
8 to my knowledge, in terms of classifying newcomers against
9 oldtimers in terms of states that deny benefits to people
10 who have just arrived as opposed to people who haven't.

And

11 I know of no case in which this Court has dealt with a
12 question of residency where it applies to every single
13 person in the state born any length of time and is not
14 singling out newcomers.
15

QUESTION;

The compelling state interest test.

But the level of benefits is different

16 depending upon residence.
17
18 different.

MR. GROSS;

The people it applies to is

In all the durational residency cases people are

19 divided into two classes;

people who have just arrived in

20 the state and everyone else.
21

QUESTION;

22

MR. GROSS:

In this case —

There are 18 levels or 20 levels.
There are an infinite number of

23 levels. Justice O'Connor.

Everyone in this state whether

24 you're born there -- I mean, the majority of people of this
25 state have basically put these distinctions on themselves.

41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 This is not some insular group like newcomers that are being
2 dealt with.

This is a distinction which has been imposed by

3 the majority of the people of the State of Alaska on
4 themselves.

So you’re not talking about the kind of

5 situation you deal with in a right to travel case where
6 you’re talking about people who travel to the state.

This

7 as much applies to people that were born there.
8

QUESTION;

Well, do you think that, for instance,

9 voters in a state could adopt by vote a welfare scheme that
10 would determine the level of benefits based on the number of
11 years that the person had lived in the state and have a
12 graduated scale?
13

MR. GROSS;

I couldn’t think of a valid public

14 purpose for that. Justice O’Connor, whereas here, as I’ve
15 tried to indicate, we have a complex and rather lengthy
16 scheme to deal with a financial situation in the state which
17 is unique.
18

But to answer your question originally, you asked

19 me what would happen if we came to a compelling state
20 interest.

My initial answer was to suggest that it is not a

21 compelling state interest test.

Were it to be a compelling

22 state interest, I could not justify it here and would not
23 attempt to.

There are other ways, I am sure, that these

24 same ends could be reached or at least attempted to be
25 reached.

This is an unusual one in an effort to try

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 something new, in an effort to make this work.
2

You know, I only have a few minutes, and I just

3 did I answer your question?
4

As I understand the principle which is being

5 advocated here, it is in essence that the state can never
6 make distinctions based on length of residency.
7 simply an erroneous statement.

That is

I mean, this Court has

8 upheld instances in which the state has done so.

In

9 Chimento with the seven-year residency requirement it didn't
10 even find it to be a substantial federal question.

And in

11 Sosna, aside from an individualized residency -- I believe
12 which Justice Behnquist suggested -- that whether she could
13 prove individualized residency or not was irrelevant because
14 Iowa required that she reside there for a full year.

So

15 that the flat statement is simply wrong.
16

Now, we're dealing with, you know, a federal

17 constitution.

You're talking about citizenship rights which

18 should be expounded to the limit, to the extent they are
19 necessary to hold this country together, to protect
20 fundamental rights, to protect the kind of national interest
21 that you talk about on a federal level.
22

This program doesn't have anything to do with

23 national interest.

It has no impact on the right to travel

24 whatsoever, theoretical or real.

You are protecting no

25 insular minority within this state such as newcomers to the
