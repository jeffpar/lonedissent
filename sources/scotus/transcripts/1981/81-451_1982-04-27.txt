Mr. Mayo, I think you may proceed whenever

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES C. MAYO, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

7

MR. MAYO:

10

We will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court*
This case is a Section 5 Voting Rights Act

11

case up from the Mississippi Supreme Court.

The issue

12

that is before this Court is can the Mississippi Supreme

13

Court order noncompliance with the Voting Rights Act.

A

14 submission was made — and I would add, voluntarily made
15

— on the basis that we did it on an issue that we

16

raised before the Chancery Court of Winston County and

17

made a submission to the Justice Department under

18

Section 5 of the Act for preclearance on changes in the

19 method and manner of the election of the trustees of the
20
21

22

Louisville Municipal Separate School District.
QUESTION*

Mr. Mayo, you say the issue is

whether the Supreme Court of Mississippi can require

23 noncompliance with the Voting Rights Act.

Do you think

24 the opinion of the Supreme Court of Mississippi has
25

ordered noncompliance or has simply refused to order

compliance?
MR • MAYO:

2

Well, we were placed under — we

3

have received this letter from the Justice Department

4

telling us that the changes were legally unenforceable.

5

But the decree, the final decree of the lower court

6

ordered the election to remain in force subject to

7

compliance with the Act, and the decision of the

8

Mississippi Supreme Court in 52758 advised us and

9

ordered us and mandated us to ignore the lower court,

10

which required compliance with the Voting Rights Act.
QUESTION:

11

Hell, where does that leave you?

12

The Supreme Court of Mississippi simply said that the

13

chancellor shouldn’t have put in the direction that the

14

election comply with the Voting Rights Act.

15

think that after the decision of the Supreme Court of

16

Mississippi you are no longer free to go into federal

17

court and urge that the federal Voting Rights Act

18

govern?

19

MR. MAYO:

Do you

Hell, I think our relief under the

20

Voting Rights Act as I understand it is we either obtain

21

approval or resubmit to Justice or we go into the

22

District Court of Columbia, is the way I interpret the

23

Act, Your Honor.

24

You don't think you could have gone

into a federal Court in Mississippi just for a

reached.

Is that right or not?

to ultimately solve the problem, and we will more than

likely go into —

of all, it’s in violation of the Voting Bights Act in my

opinion; and secondly, it does not -- the results of the

MR. MAYO:

May I ask you about the statute

that requires the majority vote.

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
MR. REYNOLDS;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court;
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to

20

the Mississippi Supreme Court to review that court's

21

judgment ordering the election of trustees to the

22

Louisville School District to proceed under changed

23

election procedures without first obtaining preclearance

24

under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and

25

notwithstanding an objection to the changed procedures

by the Attorney General of the United States.
The ultimate issue is whether the Mississippi

3

court erred in mandating implementation of the voting

4

change in the absence of Section 5 preclearance.

5

addressing that question, which we believe requires an

6

affirmative response. Respondents have raised the

7

threshold question whether this Court can properly reach

8

the Section 5 inquiry in light of the procedural history

9

of this case.

10

Before

Very briefly, that procedural history is that

the Louisville School District since 1960 has embraced

14

were appointed by city officials of Louisville and two

15

of whom were elected at large by qualified electors

16

outside of Louisville.

17

The school

In 1964 the Mississippi legislature enacted

18

legislation applicable to the Louisville School District

19

requiring each of the trustees to be elected from a

20

different one of five supervisory districts.

came to this Court on certiorari, and thus the argument

is made that because that was a final judgment at that

precluded now to take up the federal question on the

there's nothing at all in that first Mississippi

on remand reviewed the federal question, or indeed this

19

Court were alerted to the Mississippi Supreme Court's

20

post hac characterization of its first ruling.

21

that first ruling by its terms was certainly susceptible

22

to the understand by everybody that it was a non-final

23

decision as to Section 5, it didn't speak to it, and

24

that the Section 5 question was one that was available

25

to the parties to litigate in chancery court on remand,

which indeed they did.
Surely if the first decision is one that does

2
3

not by its terms give anybody an indication of finality,

4

the parties cannot be barred from Supreme Court review

5

of the federal question, nor can this Court be estopped

6

from ruling on that issue in the absence of notice that

it was indeed a final judgment at the time that it came

8

here the first time.
QUESTION*

9

Mr. Reynolds, that's basically a

10

question of Mississippi law, isn't it, the extent of the

11

application of law of the case or collateral judicial

12

estoppel?

13

MR. REYNOLDS s

Well, the Mississippi law as I

14

understand it on law of the case is that it applies

15

where you have a legal — a disposition of a legal issue

16

that was finally determined.

And what I think — I

•*i

17

think you're right that it is an application of

18

Mississippi law.

19

But if there is nothing in the first

20

Mississippi opinion at the time that it's rendered,

21

decision at the time it's rendered, to give an

22

indication that there was a final judgment on the merits

23

of the federal question issue at that time, we think

24

that this Court is not precluded nor are the litigants

25

precluded from re-addressing that or addressing that

NR. REYNOLDS:

It hadn’t been

Well, I think, though, that in

time that would bar reaching the federal guestion at

13

this time, that it’s different than the res judicata

14

situation.

15

is properly here and that the grant of certiorari was a

16

proper grant.

And our view is that the issue on the merits

On the merits, the decision of the Mississippi

17
18

court I think did mandate that this election go into

20

was error if the change, the voting change in question,

21

was a covered change under the Voting Rights Act.

22

have briefed the question as to whether it was a covered

change.

24
25

And in doing so, that

was an election here that was involved.

that a change which goes into effect after

’64, and this Court’s decision in Perkins v.

'64 is one

And then the only other question that really

relates to whether it’s a covered change is whether or

I think that on that, first, it’s
The Mississippi Supreme Court,

that a court-ordered change by a state court would be

20

is in the East Carroll Parish case that there are some

court-ordered changes pursuant to the federal court

reapportionment plans that might be immune from Section

Mr. Reynolds, may I ask you a

question.

Does the record tell us, or if it doesn't can

MR. REYNOLDS*

Were there

There were — well, there was

16

one runoff.

17

without runoff and in one district there was a runoff

18

and there was an election by majority vote.

19

majority vote requirement did take effect in the past

20

election as to one of the five districts.

21

22

23

There were four — four people were elected

QUESTION*

So that the

Is that what is in issue in the

federal case, just that one district?
MR. REYNOLDS*

No, the federal case relates to

24

the voting change, not to the past election.

And the

25

Attorney General objected to the majority runoff

requirement.

In fact, he objected before the election

2

to the majority runoff requirement.
QUESTIOMs

3

But in that litigation, is it not

4

fair to predict that it will not affect four of the

5

people who now hold office, no matter what happens to

6

it?
MR. REYNOLDS!

7

Well, no, I don't think that

8

would be necessarily the case, because all the people

9

that are elected now are being elected from supervisor

10

districts, which is different from the prior arrangement

11

where you had three appointed and two elected, but not

12

elected by any defined supervisor district.
So if you were to set aside the election

13
14

because it had not been precleared, it would affect all

15

five of them.
QUESTION*

16

Would that mean then that the three

17

people appointed by the city and the two elected from

18

outside the city would then be returned to office?
MR. REYNOLDS*

19

I think that if one were to set

20

aside the election that would, unless there were some

21

other accommodation, that that would probably be the

22

result.

QUESTION:

Well, why shouldn't there just be a

new election free of the specific thing the Attorney

25

General objected to?

that issue.

14

the court is redrafting its own reapportionment plan and

it has in front of it an objection from the Attorney

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAUREL G. WEIR, ESQ

2

OR BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

3

MR. WEIR:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

4 the Court:
5‘

We filed this lawsuit in the United States

6 District Court for the North District of Mississippi,
7 Aberdeen, Mississippi, originally by five people
8

representing the citizens of each one of the five

9 supervisor districts of Winston County, Mississippi.

We

10 alleged that the one-man, one-vote rule was being
11

violated and we thought there was no doubt but what it

12 was.
13

It had continuously been done and since even

14 before the Voting Rights Act vast groups of citizens
15 from time to time tried to get that remedied.

Even the

16 legislature of the State of Mississippi saw that the
17 one-man, one-vote theory was being violated and they
18 even enacted a statute before the Voting Rights Act took
19 effect.
20
21

No one was ever successful in court or in the
legislature or anywhere else to get relief.

So I filed

When we got to the U.S. district court — this

4

people could ever get a hearing in the U.S. district

court.

7

jurisdiction of the matter, true enough, and that there

8

were federal questions raised there, the one-man,

But he thought that it was better — and there

11
12

are many federal decisions to uphold his theory — that

13

the State of Mississippi in the state courts ought to

14

first be granted the right to pass upon those matters.

15

And he put in his order of July 1, 1975, that he

16

retained jurisdiction and gave the citizens 60 days in

17

which to file a suit in the state court.

Well, we promptly filed our suit in the state

stipulated into the record that all supervisor districts

7

were in compliance with the Justice Department rules and

8

that all five of the supervisor districts do come into

9

the city limits of the city of Louisville, Mississippi.

10

And it was long after that until any black ever served

11

on the board of trustees for the Louisville Municipal

12

13

Mr. Mayo made reference to the fact that one

However, they said they didn't have to reach

2

that point since there was already a statute that said

3

that they did have to have an election.

4

not been for the statute they would still have called an

5

election because of the one-man, one-vote theory being

violated, in violation of the Constitution of the United

States, the state of Mississippi and the laws of the

But if it had

Row, he brought Mr. Mayo -- and one of the

10

Justices here I balieve was concerned about, should they

11

put the old trustees back in office in the event of a

12

reversal.

13

The court ruled that the trustees that were serving were

14

never legal trustees at all, and the court order just

15

provided that they could only continue to serve until

16

they could have the election and the election should be

17

held as soon as possible.

Let me call your attention to this factor*

And his only objection, by the way, is not to

keep down the election; his only objection was that the

plurality theory ought to win as compared to the runoff

election.

13

Hell, so we go back into court and file a

petition with the chancellor saying, all right, we don’t

care whether they have a plurality election or whether

they have a runoff election.

us, because our interest is the interest in the schools

22

and the children, who are going to teach our children,

23

who are going to be trustees of our schools; and that we

24

also prayed that if the court found it necessary to join

QUESTION*

On that appeal, can you refresh

me?

question whether the chancellor was correct in saying

that the majority vote requirement could not be severed

6

from the election, or did they just not reach that?

Did the Mississippi Supreme Court pass on the

I'll tell you how that

came about.

10

Thank you for raising the question.

I was

Of course, they claim in their opinion that,

11

first of all, the case law had already been decided and

12

therefore that issue could not come before the court.

13

But this sentence appears in the opinion of the

14

Mississippi Supreme Court, which you all have up here,

15

if I understand correctly.

16

QUESTION*

This is the latest opinion?

17

MR. WEIR*

That's the last opinion, yes.

18

"On oral argument both parties agreed to abide

19

by the statutory scheme requiring a runoff election."

20

In other words, nobody has questioned that in this

21

court, no one has raised that issue.

Nobody’s raised the point.

7

That question can’t even be ruled

Does that answer your question?

That's the

way they disposed of it.
QUESTION*

Well, in a way it does.

But you in

8

the trial court had said you were willing to abandon the

9

runoff election.

10

US. WEIEs

I told him it didn't make us any

11

difference, Judge.

12

I say, saying that we don’t care whether it's a

13

plurality or a runoff.

14

We’ve been deprived of it since 1960.

15

See, we had a petition on file, like

All we want is an election.

So that's the way the Mississippi Supreme

16

Court disposed of that issue, though, saying that Mr.

17

Mayo agreed right there in open court that there would

18

be a runoff and that I agreed for the other side there

19

would be a runoff.

20

Nobody disputes that fact.

But also, there was another reason that they

21

ruled maybe in that manner, because of the law of the

22

case theory, which I’m going to get down to argue if I

have time to in just a few moments here.

This is just the

opinion of the Mississippi Supreme Court.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but is it supported

by the record or not?

parties could stipulate their way out of the Voting

No, sir.

Well, to show that there's no issue

Well, that may be.

But how did the

case get here, then?
MR. WEIR:

7

Well, that's a good question.

They

8

don't state any jurisdictional grounds whatsoever in the

And we raised that.

They just merely say

that the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled against them

QUESTION:

Well, somebody, whoever brought the

case here, isn't satisfied with the result below,

14

including not being satisfie, with ignoring the

objection to the runoff election.

16

MR. WEIR:

We objected to the jurisdiction,

17

and when they went to write down jurisdiction they

merely say one, two sentences:

Petitioners are disavowing their stipulation in the

Mississippi Supreme Court?

3
4

MB. HEIR;

Well, certainly they are. Judge.

No doubt about that.

5

QUESTION*

Well, I suppose what they're saying

6

now is, they could say, well, whatever we stipulated to

7

then, the two parties were acting contrary to the

8

federal law.

9
10

MR. WEIR*

Well, I was going to get down to

that, Judge, right shortly.

11

QUESTION:

Okay.

12

MR. WEIR*

You see, the first petition that

13

came here to this Court, they argued the voting rights

14

statute, you see, and it was plainly and clearly printed

15 in there.

And I filed an opposition paper to that

16 petition for rehearing.

That's in the court record.

17 copy of both is in there.
And when it got back to the Mississippi

18
19

Supreme Court, they cited where you all denied

20

certiorari on 441 U.S. 946, but they say it's not your

21

decision that makes the law of the case; it says it's

issue had already been disposed of.
SR. WEIR;

13

Right, and at the time of the

15

It's like, if you want to raise a

17

a federal issue you have to raise it in the trial court

18

first.

19

SR. WEIR*

And if you don’t you waive it.

20

Another case, Rio Grande Railway versus

21

Stringham, said that since the first judgment settled

22

the issue and disposed of the whole case on the merits

23

and directed what judgment should be entered, there was

24

nothing left for the lower court to do, and then that

that under the circumstances they have no right to alter

MR. MAYO;

Justice —

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

4

MR. MAYO*

Two minutes.

I'd like to correct an error in one

5

question that Mr. Justice Stevens asked about the

6

election.

There was a runoff in four of the five.

The

7 elections were December the 5th and December the 19th.
8

There was a runoff election in four.

In district number

9 two there was an exact tie, and by special order the two
10

candidates agreed to have a runoff election on December

11

the 19th.

QUESTION*

12

13

And I wanted to correct that.
Could I ask you, what is your

answer to law of the case position, just briefly?
MR. MAYO*

14

I would say that the law of the

15 case doctrine is not applicable to Section 5 and Section
16

5 compliance.
QUESTION*

17

Do you think the Mississippi

18 Supreme Court, not in its last opinion but in the
19 opinion before this, that it decided the Section 5
20

question?
MR. MAYO*

21

22

Ho, sir, they did not decide it.

In 49-446, the first opinion, they did not decide the

23 Section 5.

Hhat we did was no different than what the

24 attorneys did in McDaniel versus Sanchez.
