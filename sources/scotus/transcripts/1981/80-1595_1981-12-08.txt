ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FREY, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. FREY;

7

Thank you Mr. Justice Brennan, and may

8 it please the Court*

In March 1963 Thomas Bennett was beaten and

9
10

stomped to death in his home.

Respondent and a co-defendant

11 were apprehended after emerging from Bennett’s home by
12 police officers called to the scene by neighbors.
13 covered

They were

with Bennett *s blood and co-defendant Gordon had

14 just discarded on the street a wallet that was taken from
15 Bennett.
16

In November 1963, respondent was convicted of

17 first degree murder and of robbery,
18 by the jury.

and sentenced to death

On his appeal, the case was heard by the en

19 banc D.C. Circuit,

which reversed the sentence of death for

20 procedural improprieties,

but affirmed the conviction of

21 first degree murder.
22

After a series of unsuccessful collateral attacks

23 on his conviction and one successful one relating to his
24 sentence, respondent commenced
25 1979, nearly

the present proceeding in

16 years after he had been convicted.
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

The challenge in this proceeding is certain

2 instructions which were given to the jury at his trial on
3 the element of malice, which is one of the elements of first
4 degree murder.

Now, specifically, the instructions that the

5 court of appeals addressed were three.

The first was the

6 instruction given in Sandstrom that a person is presumed to
7 intend the natural and probable consequences of his act.
8 The court did not rely on this instruction as a ground for
9 reversal.

I'm looking at page 27 of the Joint Appendix, and

10 page 28.
11

The second part of the malice instruction that was

12 troublesome was the statement that in determining whether a
13 wrongful act is intentionally done and is therefore done
14 with malice aforethought — you should again bear in mind.

15

Now, it is correct, as the District of Columbia

16 Circuit recognized several years after its decision on
17 Frady*s original appeal, that this is an improper statement
18 because it is not necessarily the case that an intentional
19 act is therefore done with malice.

20

Similarly, in discussing the significance of the

21 use of a weapon in this case, on page 28 of the Joint

22 Appendix, the district court said "The law infers or
23 presumes from the use of such weapon, in the absence of
24 explanatory or mitigating circumstances, the existence of
25 the malice essential to culpable homicide."

That

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 instruction also was disapproved by the District of Columbia
2 Circuit in subsequent cases.
3

No objection was made by counsel to any of these

4 instructions.
5

QUESTIONi

Mr. Frey, before you leave the specific

6 instructions, do you happen to know whether these
7 instructions were given to the jury in written form?

Or

8 were they just read orally?
9

ME. FEEY:

I'm afraid I don't know.

10

QUESTIONi

It appears they were read orally, but I

11 can't really be sure.

12

MR. FREY:

I'm not sure.

I will come back to the

13 instructions in a moment because there's another point I
14 want to make about them, but first I'd like to summarize for
15 the Court what the court of appeals held in ordering that
16 habeas corpus relief be granted to respondent in this case.
17

First it held, citing this Court's opinion in

18 Davis v. United States, that the standard of review of such
19 a claim on collateral attack is plain error under Rule 52(b)

20 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
21

Secondly, it held that if the standard is not

22 plain error, but rather the cause and prejudice standard of
23 Davis and of Wainwright v.

Sykes, then that was satisfied.

24 The cause prong satisfied because it would have been futile
25 to object to these instructions because they were standard

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

at the time they were given; the prejudice prong essentially

2 satisfied because of the court's conclusion that it was not
3 clearly harmless error in the circumstances of this case;

it

4 might have affected the jury’s verdict.
5

Then the only remaining question in the Court of

6 Appeals' analysis was whether the decisions in which the
7 D.C. Circuit recognized these errors in the standard jury
8 instructions should be applied retroactively, and the court
9 held, relying on Hankerson v. North Carolina, that because
10 they relate to the jury's determination of factual guilt or

11 innocence, they do have to be applied retroactively.
12

Now, the decision, in our view, incorporates a

13 number of serious errors.

To characterize its result, I

14 would say that first, it completely erases the distinction
15 between direct and collateral attack in the federal system.
16 Secondly, it renders the requirements of contemporaneous
17 objection in Rule 30 of the Federal Rules of Criminal
18 Procedure a dead letter.

And it attaches to each new

19 decision altering the Rules of Evidence or the proper form
20 of jury instructions the consequence of invalidating large
21 numbers of prior convictions obtained before the new
22 decision was handed down.

23

Before I address the questions that the court of

24 appeals addressed, I'd like to pause for a moment on the
25 question of whether this is a constitutional or a
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 non-constitutional error.

This is something of a morass and

2 I'm not sure that I understand it totally, but it is
3

significant because if it's not a constitutional error, then

4

the failure to raise this point on appeal would appear to

5 foreclose the issue under this Court's holding in Sunal v.
6 Large.
7

Secondly, if it's not a constitutional error,

8 while that does not absolutely foreclose relief under

2255,

9 the standard announced in Davis two is that you must have a
10 fundamental defect inherently resulting in a complete
11 miscarriage of justice.

Now, that standard, it seems to me,

12 must be different from the harmless error standard that the
13
14

court of appeals effectively applied in this case.
Indeed, if the error is non-constitutional, it

15

seems to me that the decision of the court of appeals,

16

recognizing the error, is not significantly different from a

17 statute that would be passed by Congress to correct what it
18

viewed as an improper jury instruction, and I don't think

19 anybody could seriously contend that if Congress had passed
20 a statute in

1967,

that Frady would be able to come in and

21 invoke that statute as grounds for collateral relief.
22

Now, I think the error here was not of

23 constitutional magnitude, and in this connection it seems to
24 me that the important case is Sandstrom, but what is
25 instructive is the contrast between Sandstrom and the
7

present case
In Sandstrom, the issue was whether the defendant,

2
3

who admitted killing the victim, had intended to kill the

4

victim.

5

in the instruction which was a focal instruction in the case

6

was that it may have caused reasonable jurors to believe

7

that if his actions were such as would be likely to bring

8

about death, then they must find Sandstrom guilty, no matter

9

what they felt about his own state of mind.

10

And the principal difficulty that the court found

Now, many of the cases of this court, Cupp v.

QUESTION;

Well, it isn't in so many words one of

the questions you listed, is it?
MR. FREY;

No, we didn't list that as a question,

14

but I do think it is material to the Court's consideration

15

of whether the failure to object at trial and to raise the

16

issue on appeal, which is a question that we did present,

17

should bar review.

18

But let me move on to the question, if I may, of

19

whether plain error is the proper standard for review in a

20

collateral attack.

21

I think the court has made several fundamental

22

mistakes in reaching this conclusion.

said is that —

2

QUESTION*

The reason I come back to this point is

3 that in the prior case, one of the arguments that was made
4 is that the Wainwright standard simply doesn't apply if the
5 error is sufficiently grave.
6

QUESTION*

Well, that’s what was held below, isn't

MR. FREY:

Well, what the court held below was

7 it?
8

9 that Davis dictated the plain error standard in the federal
10 context, because Davis said that you would have no more
11 liberal access to collateral review than you would have to

12 review on direct appeal in the case of a procedural default,
13 and the court took that as a holding that you would have
14 equal access to collateral review or to direct review.
15

Now, the use of the plain error standard, as I

16 said, obliterates any distinction between collateral and
17 direct review, and

this is the distinction that the court

18 has repeatedly recognized from Sunal v.

Large if not

19 earlier, up to the Addonizio case a couple of terms ago.

20

The second thing is that obviously, the

21 consequences of applying the plain error rule on collateral

22 attack are far more sweeping in a case like this,
23 potentially hundreds of murder convictions are subject to
24 collateral attack under the decision of the court of
25 appeals.

If you were confining it to cases on direct

MR. FREY*

3

But otherwise, hasn't it been regarded

Even if it's regarded as a continuation

4

of the criminal case, a kind of retrospective look at the

5

case, the question is what are the appropriate standards to

6 apply in making that look.

And I would make the point that the cause and

7
8

prejudice standard seems to me to be responsive to the issue

9

that’s presented as to whether a procedural default should

10 or should not foreclose a claim on collateral

attack.

And that seems to me to be the proper inquiry to

Now, if I can turn to the question then of

15
16

17

under the cause ane prejudice standard.

18

issue both here and in the previous case, and I think

19

underlying the viewpoint of those who find that futility of

20 objection should be cause is the

This is the key

view that it’s not fair to

21 defendants and to their lawyers to expect them to anticipate
22 rulings

that are not evident at the time of the trial.

23

Now, it has a certain superficial appeal, but it

24

does not seem to me to be justified on close analysis, and

25

of course, I remind the court, as counsel for Ohio says,
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 that the consequences of applying it in the collateral
2 attack context can be very grave indeed in terms of the
3 numbers of cases that would be affected.
4

Now, proper analysis of this issue seems to me to

5 require consideration of several subissues.

The first

6 question is what constitutes futility; is it that the trial
7 court would likely reject the objection; is it that you have
8 no prospect of succeeding on appeal; is it that you have no
9 prospect in this court?

I would say when you're dealing

10 with a federal law or constitutional issue, short of an
11 authoritative holding by this Court it seems to me difficult

12 to characterize any ruling as futile to object to.
13

The second question is, does it make any

14 difference whether the lawyer in this particular case
15 actually refrained from objecting on account of a judgment

16 that he made regarding futility.

There's no evidence that

17 that was the basis for the failure to object in this case.

18

And there are two possibilities.

One is to do

19 what the court of appeals did and presume that all lawyers

20 who didn't raise this objection did so because they thought
21 it would be futile, in which case many defendants will be

22 getting relief on a purely windfall basis totally unrelated
23 to the actual reason for the default.

Or the alternative is

24 to conduct what will be, I think, a very difficult and
25 taxing inquiry into the lawyer's actual motives in not

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 making an objection to something that was potentially
2 objectionable.
3

Now let me turn to the next question which is,

4 does it matter whether the lawyer was right or wrong in his
5 decision that it would have been futile.

In our view, the

6 respondent should not prevail in either case.
7

Let me say preliminarily that any assumption that

8 if the court of appeals indulged that respondent’s counsel
9 was right in judging that it would have been futile to
10 object seems to me completely unsupportable because the
11 court of appeals, shortly thereafter, in fact observed on

12 its own these errors, and in the course of doing so it noted
13 that it must have been just a slip of tongue by the judge,

14 which surely would have been corrected if he had noted it.
Now, if the lawyer's assumption that it would be

15

16 futile to object was wrong, then it seems to me his mistake
17 is no different from many others that defense lawyers,
18 human, make during the course of a criminal trial.

being

For

19 example, the failure to call a helpful witness, the failure

20 to pursue a line of cross examination that would have been
21 useful,

or many other things.

22

Now, the standard for assessing whether such

23 mistakes justify a new trial on collateral relief, I think,
24 is the Sixth Amendment of ineffective assistance of counsel
25 standard.

And in response to the question that Justice
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

White asked during the last argument, my view is that it is

2 not, I think, correct to equate a mistake on the part of the
3 lawyer in raising a useful claim with ineffective assistance
4 of counsel.

The mistake may be of such a magnitude and may

5 have such a fundamental effect in undermining the
6 defendant's prospects of success at trial and be so
7 prejudicial that in all the circumstances, the court will
8 judge it to be a constitutional violation.
9

In any event, my point here is simply that a

10 mistaken judgment about the futility of raising an objection
11

is really no different from any other kind of mistake that a

12 defense lawyer can make.
13

Now, I note in this connection that the

14 contemporaneous objection rule does perform a very important
15 function because by insisting on a contemporaneous
16 objection, you do improve the chance that the error will be
17 avoided or corrected at the trial, that it will not occur.

3

my brother will suggest that it has a substantial effect.

4

don't agree, but --

5

QUESTION;

I assume
I

But let’s just assume for purposes of

6

history that you go from Davis one to Francis v. Henderson

7

to Wainwright v. Sykes, and you have specific language in

8

Davis one; it's carried over in Francis v. Henderson, and in

9

Wainwright v. Sykes it's perhaps elaborated on, but it

10

expresses more a feeling or mood rather than any precise

11

standard or any measurable thing as if it were dealing with

12

mathematical equations.

13

MR. FREY;

But I think it does express a policy.

14

It doesn't explain what cause means and what prejudice

15

means, but it certainly reflects a policy which this Court

16

has adopted, that there has to be an excuse for a procedural

17

default before the habeas corpus defendant will be allowed

18

to come in and seek relief.

19

He has to justify it.

That's what we're talking about now; is what

constitutes this sufficient justification.

21

indicated that in my view, a mistaken belief that it would

22

be futile to object cannot possible be a sufficient

23

justification .

24
25

And I have

So let's now turn to the perhaps more difficult
question; that is, assuming that the lawyer is right in his
18

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

view that that objection would be futile, whatever is

2

necessary to satisfy that -- let’s say the situation in

3

Sunal v. Large where the appellate Second Circuit had

4

definitively rejected claims by other defendants, and this

5

Court had denied certiorari on those claims.

6

if it can ever be said, that the lawyer is correct in

7

assuming futility.

8

for enforcing the procedural default and for not treating

9

this accurate assessment of futility as cause.

So let us say,

Nevertheless, substantial reasons exist

First of all, I come back to the consequences of a

10
11

rule that does treat it as cause whenever you have a change

12

in the law.

13

regard to a proper instruction, with regard to a commonly

14

occurring evidentiary ruling, with regard to any of the

15

things that may come up at trial with some frequency, the

16

effect of saying that the lawyer couldn't have known that

17

the law would change and therefore, everybody who had this

18

issue treated adversely to them in their trial is entitled

19

to collateral relief is quite substantial.

Whenever you have a change in the law with

And that, I think, was the point of footnote 8 in

20
21

Hankerson.

It was an effort to confine this effect, while

22

still recognizing the retroactivity that people who had felt

23

the claim was important enough that they were going to raise

24

it and try to insist upon it and try to get it litigated,

25

the court felt it was not fair to deprive them of the
19

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 benefit, but the people who didn't, this was a limiting
2 principle that I think makes a lot of sense.
3

Secondly, if you are going to say that there is no

4 penalty attached to the default, that if a lawyer looks at a
5 particular issue that he might raise and says there's no

6 point in my raising it, therefore I won't, and if it's all
7 right for him to say that and he has full access to

8 collateral attack when somebody else does raise it and does
9 prevail, you've removed the incentives to counsel for

10 raising claims that may bring about improvements in the law.
11

In fact, if somebody who raised it, as in Davis

12 two, and lost — if somebody who raised it and lost might be
13 foreclosed on the ground of law of the case, but somebody
14 who didn't raise it would have access to collateral relief,
15 you would actually have created some disincentives to
16 raising claims like this.

17

Another point about the contemporaneous objection

18 rule and the reliance on the default as a ground for

19 foreclosing access to collateral relief, is that a
20 contemporaneous objection is one of the best ways we have of
21 judging whether the issue was important to the defense in
22 the context of the particular case.

It seems to me that the

23 court cannot indulge the assumption that every potential
24 issue that was in a case on which the law at some time in
25 the future changes, indulge the assumption that that was
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 important to the defendant and justifies giving him
2 collateral relief, even though he didn't say a peep about it
3 at trial and he didn’t raise it on appeal.
4

Now, if I can sum up, the issue here is a balance

5 between the interests of our system in finality in criminal
6 cases against the concern in our system that substantial
7 injustice not be done, that innocent defendants not be
8 incarcerted.

These are important values, and obviously, we

9 don’t insist on the same degree of finality in criminal
10 cases that we do in civil cases.
11

Nevertheless, it does remain of significant value

12 in our system and the court has often recognized it, and
13 it’s not to be overriden lightly, but only when there are
14 compelling justifications for such an action.

This is so

15 even when the defendant and his attorney are not at all
16 blameworthy with

respect to some

17 think I can best

illustrate this point for you by reference

18 to the treatment

of motionsfor a new trial on the basis

evidence.

20

error at trial.

And I

of

If you have newly discovered evidence which raises

21 some question about the defendant’s guilt; that is, it might
22 have affected the outcome of the trial, there are two points
23 to notice about it.

First of all, if the lawyer did not

24 exercise due diligence in discovering this evidence, even
25 though the client is in no way to blame for this, relief of
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 new trial is foreclosed for the lack of due diligence

This

2 is to ensure that the trial itself is the main event, as the
3 court said in Wainwright, and not a tryout on the road.
4

That is analogous to the lawyer who mistakenly

5 thinks that an objection would be futile.
6

Now, even where the newly discovered evidence

7 could not have been found in the exercise of due diligence,
8 and the defendant and his lawyer are therefore in no way to
9 be blamed, the witness comes back from Tibet and suddenly
10 discloses information, we don't apply a standard like the
11 court of appeals applied in this case that if it might have

12 affected the trial; the standard that is applied is that it
13 would have to probably have resulted in an acquittal before
14 a new trial is granted.

15

Now, this may seem harsh, but it is the

16 accommodation that our system makes between two competing
17 important interests; the interest in finality and the
18 interest in not incarcerating innocent defendants.
19

If the Court accepts the reasoning of the D.C.

20 Circuit in this case, there is no balance struck between
21 those interests; there is no value afforded to finality in

22 criminal cases.

There is nothing but a harmless error

23 inquiry in every case when a defendant comes up with some
24 new principle or some new fact which he can call to the
25 Court's attention years and years later.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. SCHEMBER, ESQ.

4

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT
MR. SCHEMBER;

5

Mr. Justice Brennan, and may it

6 please the Court*

The government has briefed this case as if Mr.

7

8 Frady were a federal prisoner convicted of a federal offense
9

and who has filed a post-conviction relief motion raising

10 only federal issues.

All three of those premises are false,

11

and the government completely overlooks this aspect of the

12

case.

13

Mr. Frady is a District of Columbia prisoner.

He

14

was convicted of a local crime.

15

post-conviction relief raised instruction errors which said,

16

in effect, that the instructions given at the trial

17

improperly informed the jury as to what the government had

18

to prove in order to establish the elements of the offense

19

of first degree murder.

20

His motion for

He also raised the claim that these instructions

21 were also erroneous under Kullaney and Sandstrom, the

22 constitutional issue.
23

QUESTION*

24

MR. SCHEMBER*

25

You say he raised these at the trial?
No, I'm referring, Your Honor, to

his post-conviction relief petition.
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, the federal district court in the District of

2 Columbia and the court of appeals, they sit in a unique

3 jurisdiction, and this case dates from a time period when
4 the federal court in the District of Columbia served as both
5 a local court and the federal court, exercising both Article
6

7
8

I and Article III power.
In hearing the post-conviction relief petition,
the district court was exercising a remaining vestige of

9 that Article I power which was not taken away in 1970 when
10
11
12

most of that power was transferred to the superior court.
In this circumstance, where you have a D.C.
prisoner convicted solely of a D.C. offense prior to the

13 Court Reform Act, having to come back to the court which
14 sentenced him, as 2255 says, with a claim that his
15 conviction is improper under District of Columbia law and
16 that's the only forum he can go to to make that claim, the
17 district court has an obligation to afford relief if
18 District of Columbia law in fact affords relief.
19

This was the basic premise of the court of

20

appeals' reliance on the Green and Wharton cases, the

21

primary precedents which the court invoked to grant relief

22

in this case.

Green and Wharton involved the two

23 instructions that were involved in the Frady case, and -24

QUESTION*

You don't deny, do you, that it was a

25 2255 proceeding?
24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. SCHEMBER:

1

Yes, it was, Your Honor.

2255

2 applies to any prisoner who was sentenced by a court created

3 by act of Congress.

Therefore, it applies to Mr. Frady.

4 2255 then tells the prisoner what court you have to go to,
5 and 2255 says it’s the sentencing court.

The sentencing

6 court in this case was the United States District Court.

7 Why was the United States District Court the sentencing
8

court in this purely local case?

It was the sentencing

9 court because this case arose prior to the Court Reform Act
10

of

1970.

Prior to that time, the U.S. District Court had

11

jurisdiction to try all local felonies, and served in that

12 capacity as both a local court and a federal court in a

13 similar manner as the federal courts throughout the country.
14

It is for that particular reason that this case,

15 which contains both federal constitutional issues and local
16 issues, finds it way back into the United States District
17 Cou rt.
18

The cases relied upon --

19

QUESTION:

Are you going to argue that for that

20 reason the contours of the

2255 proceeding differ, to the

21 extent that there are local issues or issues of local law as
22 to which there were errors?

23

MR. SCHEMBER:

Is that it?

My contention, Mr. Justice Brennan,

24 is that in a case such as this kind, a unique case which
25 only arises because of this unique circumstances and in a
25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 few years we won't have anymore cases of this kind due to
2 the passage of time and the fact that the Court Reform Act
3 was passed in 1970, my contention is that 2255 states that
4 the forum in which a pre-Court Reform Act prisoner must seek
5 relief is the United States District Court because that's
6 the sentencing court,
7

QUESTION*

What I'm trying to get at is how does

8 that differ — how does that change the issues that this
9 case presents from a 2255 and some other federal district -10

MR. SCHEMBER*

2255 affords relief for prisoners

11 incarcerated in violation of the Constitution and laws of

12 the United States, and it also provides relief in cases that
13 are otherwise subject to collateral attack.
14

A case of a D.C. prisoner in federal court here in

15 the District of Columbia because of this unique circumstance

16 is properly there under 2255, and if -17

QUESTION*

I don't suggest the government to

18 suggest that the case wasn't properly there, this 2255
19 proceeding is properly there.

20

MR. SCHEMBER;

No.

The point is can claims under

21 local law be made there.

22

QUESTION:

That's what I'm trying to get at.

What

23 claims under local law are here in addition to the federal
24 Constitutional claims?
25

MR. SCHEMBER*

The claim that the instructions
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

were plain error; that the instructions were erroneous

2 because the jury was not properly informed as to what the

3 prosecution had to prove to establish the elements of this
4 D.C. offense.
QUESTION;

5

And are you saying that’s an error of

6 local law?

7

MR. SCHEMBER;

8

QUESTION;

yes. Your Honor.

Although it might also be an error of

9 constitutional dimensions?
10

MR. SCHEMBER;

11

QUESTION;

12

That's correct, Your Honor.

But the same error would be both.

Is

that it?

13

MR. SCHEMBER;

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. SCHEMBER;

Yes, Your Honor,

All right.
We maintain that under the Green

16 and Wharton cases, which are valid local precedents; they
17 are decisions -18

QUESTION;

You're saying then that the scope of

19 review under 2255 is broader in the District of Columbia
20 than it is in any other federal court.
21

MR. SCHEMBER;

That is, in effect, the case, Your

22 Honor.

23

QUESTION;

What if it came up in a federal enclave

24 conviction?
25

MR. SCHEMBER;

Are you referring to -27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION;

1

In the assimilated crimes, military

2 reservations.

MR. SCHEMBER;

3

Well, under the Assimilative Crimes

4 Act, essentially that act federalizes local offenses and
5 makes them a federal offense under the Assimilative Crimes
6 Act.

That's not what's going on here.

This is a District

7 of Columbia offense, and it's tried as a District of
8 Columbia case, and it is in — it was in federal court in

9 1963 solely because at that time the U.S. District Court for
10 the
11
12

District of Columbia had unique jurisdiction, unique in

this country, to try local and federal offenses.
QUESTION;

Mr. Schember, is this something like

13 that if there’s an error of district law, entirely apart
14 from whether or not the error might also be of
15 constitutional dimensions, that in effect, if the court of
16 appeals rested its judgment on the reparation of an error of
17 district law,

that's like a state court deciding a case on a

18 state ground and therefore, it's none of our business here
19 to review it?
20

MR.

SCHEMBER*

That's my contention, Your Honor.

21 That this decision of the United

States Court of Appeals

22 rests on an adequate independent ground of District of

23 Columbia law.

That is reflected in the Green and Wharton

24 decisions upon which the court relied in reaching its result.
25

QUESTION ;

But those decisions just go to whether

MR. SCHEMBERi

5 sense that they were decided prior to February 1, 1971, -6

QUESTION*

But they don’t go to the question of

7 what is the scope of review on collateral attack, do they?
8

MR. SCHEMBER;

They do not expressly address that

9 question, of course, because they were -10

QUESTION;

They established the fact that these

11 instructions were erroneous as a matter of District of

12 Columbia law.
13

MR. SCHEMBER;

14

QUESTION;

That’s correct.

But that still leaves open the question

15 whether on collateral attack in the District of Columbia or
16 anywhere else in the federal system, the federal court may
17 review a matter of local law.

18

MR. SCHEMBER;

I turn to that question next.

19 Indeed, that was the question that the U.S. Court of Appeals

20 had to decide, or the district court as well.

Here, the

21 court was presented with a District of Columbia case with a
22 District of Columbia error in it, and the question is can
23 the U.S. Court of Appeals grant relief in the 2255

24 proceeding?
25

Our contention here is that since the 2255
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 proceeding is the only avenue open to the prisoner in this
2 situation, that as a matter of equal protection the United
3 States Court of Appeals and the district court has to afford
4 relief that would have been available -- that is available
5 under District of Columbia law and would have been afforded
6 had this case not been a pre-1970 case, but -7

QUESTION*

Well, equal protection with what?

8 Comparing this litigant with what other litigant who's being
9 treated more —
10

MR. SCHEMBERi

The other category of litigants

11 would be those tried and convicted of murder with these

12 erroneous instructions in the Superior Court of the District
13 of Columbia.
14

QUESTION*

Well, they couldn't have collateral

15 attack if this is not the right rule.

16

MR. SCHEMBERt

They could very well, Your Honor.

17 That is the point of our brief.

Under the District of

18 Columbia law, the failure of the prisoner to have raised the
19 instruction errors at trial, or on direct appeal,

20 constitute a waiver of the error.
21 of review, of course,

does not

It changes the standard

to plain error due to the operation of

22 Rule 30 and there's an analogous Rule 30 in the District of

14 District of Columbia felonies, are tried in the Superior

15 Court, are they not?

And if there's a determination that

5 Eeform Act
6

ME. SCHEMBEE;

Yes, they were.

And as such, they

7 are valid precedents of local law, since they were decided
8 -- the date is a little bit different for that issue.

Since

9 those cases were decided prior to February 1, 1971, and
10 since they resolved local issues, they are valid local
11 precedents.

Until the District of Columbia Court of Appeals

12 expressly overrules, which of course it has not.
13

QUESTION;

Yes, but in the section of the opinion

14 dealing with the standard of review, they didn’t cite those
15 cases; they relief on Davis, Fay v.

Noia and Eule 30 and

16 Eule 52(b).
17

ME. SCHEMBEE;

18

QUESTION;

Those cases were indeed cited.

They're the only cases cited.

The

19 cases that you’re relying on are on the question of whether

20 there was error; not in the part of the opinion dealing with
21 the scope of review.
22

ME. SCHEMBEE;

That’s correct, Mr. Justice

23 Stevens.

What I am maintaining in this Court is that when

24 the federal district courts in the District of Columbia are
25 faced with a situation of this kind, as a matter of equal

33

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2

QUESTION:

Well, equal protection with what?

Man

3 state collateral review systems do not allow review of a
4 matter that would just be raisable on direct appeal.

They

5 have a similar standard to the 2255 standard, fundamental
6 error, constitutional error and that sort of thing.
7

MR. SCHEMBER:

That’s correct, sir.

However,

8 examination of District of Columbia law indicates that
9 relief is not foreclosed due to failure to raise the issue.
10

QUESTION:

What is the District of Columbia case

11 on which you rely for this proposition?
12

MR. SCHEMBER:

Your Honor, a series of cases

13 culminating in the Hargett decision.

The Hargett decision

14 stated that -- well, I have to back up.

The Atkinson case

15 is cited by both the government and Mr. Frady, and the
16 Atkinson case basically held that collateral relief is
17 available for issues not raised on direct appeal under
18 exceptional circumstances.
19

Then the Hargett case, a District of Columbia

20 Court of Appeals decision, held that exceptional
21 circumstances exist when there’s been a denial of a basic
22 right not limited to constitutional rights.

It is clear

23 under District of Columbia law, that the failure to object
24 to instructional errors at trial and the failure to appeal
25 on those issues does not constitute a procedural forfeiture

MR. SCHEMBER*

1

They dealt with the very errors

2 involved in this case.

The question that the U.S. Court of Appeals faced

3

4 in light of its prior precedents in
5 were direct appeal cases,

was whether the degree of

6 prejudice of this type of error,
7 error in Green and Wharton,
8

Green and Wharton, which

recognized to be plain

was sufficient to warrant relief

on collateral attack.
There is recognition in District of Columbia law

9

10 that direct appeal and collateral attack are not the same
11

thing.

But the difference lies not in whether a forefeiture

12 or waiver exists,

but in the degree of prejudice that must

13 be shown.
14

Now, I have to admit --

15

QUESTION*

Counsel, even if you are correct and

16 you're examining the question from the standpoint of
17 prejudice,

as I understand it, Mr. Frady asserted he wasn't

18 even around
19 there.

at the time of the trial.

And yet, you have a jury that found on the facts

20 first degree murder.
21 inferred malice,

There wasn't even a need to deal with

was there?

22 under the facts of
23 there.

He wasn’t even

How was he possibly prejudiced

this case where he says he wasn’t even

And yet, the jury found he was and found the

24 evidence to support first degree murder?
25

MR. SCHEMBER:

Well, Your Honor has eloquently
36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

stated an argument that many judges that have reviewed this

2

case have made.

3

and I think for this reason.

Other judges have taken the opposing view,

4

It is true that the malice — in light of the

5

defense, the third man defense, I was not there; it was

6

someone else who did it -- as to that specific defense, that

7

was raised by the defense.

8

cannot be deemed to be prejudicial to that defense.

No, the malice instructions

But the fact that that was one of the theories

9
10

that the defense urged does not mean that that relieves the

11

government of the burden of proving malice.

12

government's case, the government's evidence here fairly

13

raised the question whether this was murder or manslaughter,

14

as the trial judge so held.

15

judge was hardly receptive to this collateral relief motion,

16

but nonetheless at the trial had held that malice is an

17

issue.

18

manslaughter.

19

And the

And I would note that the trial

Manslaughter is an issue, and gave an instruction on

On direct appeal, one judge of the court of

20

appeals held that the evidence of pre-meditation and

21

deliberation, viewed in the light most favorable to the

22

government, was insufficient as a matter of law.

23

judges disagreed.

24
25

Other

On collateral attack, again the issue of prejudice
came up; again, the question of what is the evidence of
37

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 malice, is it clear, is it not clear, and the panel held
2 below that the evidence of malice was equivocal.

On en banc

3 review there was quite blistering dissent by other members,
4 but the net result was that the court of appeals as a whole
5 sustained the judgment of the panel, that there was

6 sufficient doubt as to the evidence of malice to render
7 multiple instruction errors on that issue sufficiently
8 prejudicial to warrant relief in this case.
9

Now, the question becomes what should this Court

10 do in light of this divergence of opinion on this kind of
11 assessment of the facts and assessment of the evidence.

I

12 suggest that the Court take guidance from its decision in
13 the Fisher case.

This is a District of Columbia case, it's

14 a local case, and the judgments of the judges of the
15 District of Columbia Circuit exercising the remaining
16 vestige of their Article I jurisdiction should be deferred

17 to on a question of this kind.
18

I admit there has been sharp division of opinion

19 on the question, but I would submit that under the Fisher
20 case cited in our brief, that it is not appropriate for this
21 Court
22

QUESTIONj

Do we have an intimation that they

23 thought, that the majority thought they were exercising
24 their remaining vestige of their Article I jurisdiction?
25

ME. SCHEMBEE;

You have to pull it out of the
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 opinion.

I admit that.

But it is very direct in the fact

2 that they relied on their own precedents of Green and
3 Wharton

The government concedes those are

4 non-constitutional precedents, and if they are not decisions
5 under constitutional law, what are they?
6

They are decisions under District of Columbia law,

7 holding that the instructions given did not properly inform
8 the jury as to what the government had to prove to establish
9 the District of Columbia offense of murder.
10 Honor, is a local question.

find that, Your

And that was the basis for the

11 holdings in Green and Wharton, and Green and Wharton were

12 the cases that the Frady court relied upon in granting
13 relief in this case.
14

The question that the government raises in their

15 petition asks this Court to hold that a procedural default

16 did occur, though District of Columbia law says one did not,
17 and that the issue is absolutely waived.
18 waiver come from?

Where does this

Rule 30 does not impose a waiver because

19 all Rule 30 does is change the standard of review from

20 normal allegation of error to plain error.

It's not a

21 procedural forfeiture.
22

This Court has recognized that principle in the

23 Namet case.

This Court has also recognized that the mere

24 failure to appeal does not result in a procedural default
25 changing the standard of review on collateral attack.

39

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

That's clear from Fay v.

2 United States,

Noia, that's clear from Kaufman v.

that’s clear from Humphrey v. Cady.

All

3 cases in which this Court has held that the mere failure to
4 appeal does not by itself carry implications for the
5 standard of review on collateral attack.
QUESTION:

6

How much of Kaufman do you think is

7 left after Stone v. Powell?
MR. SCHEMBER:

8

At least the proposition that

9 failure to appeal by itself does not impose a procedural
10 default
11

changing the standard of review on collteral

attack.

12 Your

That principle was reaffirmed in Humphrey v. Cady,

Honor.

And it is also implicit in Fay v. Noia, and

13 that indeed is what is also left of Fay v. Noia,

I would

14 maintain.
15

So if we have a situation where failure to object

16 at trial merely changes the standard of review to plain
17 error, and failure to appeal does not change the standard of
18 review at all, how can the government leap to the conclusion
19 tha failure to raise the instruction error at trial somehow
20 triggers the cause and
21

22

prejudice standard when the issue is

first raised on collateral attack?
Where the court came to that conclusion in

23 previous decision was from the express provisions of Rule 12
24 in the Davis case, which expressly applied the standard of
25 cause and prejudice to the error raised there.

And the

40

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 court extended that principle in Wainwright v. Sykes and
2 Francis v. Henderson where the state courts had held a
3 procedural default to have existed, and held the claim
4 absolutely barred.
5

There, this Court, as a matter of comity and

6 respect for the state court rulings held that well, if the
7 states are going to hold the claim absolutely barred, we
8 will at least require a showing of cause and a demonstration
9 of prejudice, a lesser standard of review than the state
10 court imposed in those cases.
11

QUESTION:

Incidentally, Mr. Schember, I take it

12 all of the rule governing 2255 actions, even as to the
13 District of Columbia errors that you mentioned in your
14 submission, would apply, wouldn't they?

For example, Rule

15 12, isn't it, of the 2255 rules gives the reviewing court an
16 option to take either the criminal Rules of Procedure or the
17 civil, whichever are the more appropriate.
18

MR. SCHEMBER:

19

QUESTION :

That 's correct.

And here I gather the court of appeals

20 picked out 52(b) of the R ules of Criminal Procedure, didn't
21 they?

22

MR. SCHEMBER:

23

QUESTION;

Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.

Do you rely on that at all as a

24 latitude which Rule 12 of 2255 gives the court of appeals?
25

MR. SCHEMBER:

I would say it was certainly
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

correct for the U.S. Court of Appeals to look to Rule 52(b)

2

of the Criminal Rules in determining the proper standard of

3

review.

4

QUESTION;

Well, that’s what it did.

They just

5

selected that one, did it not, as the proper standard here?

6

Plain error standard.

7

MR. SCHEMBER;

Yes, it did. Your Honor, and I

8

would supports its analysis.

It is clear that the analysis

9

that the court of appeals needed to go through was to say

10

all right, there appear to have been two procedural

11

failings; one, a failure to appeal.

12

standard of review?

13

they say no.

14

Does that affect the

Humphrey v. Cady, Kaufman, Fay v. Noia,

Well, there was another procedural failing.

There

15

was a failure to object at trial.

16

consequence of that?

17

that is to change the standard of review to plain error and

18

analyzing the case under that standard, the court of appeals

19

granted relief and properly so.

20

Well, what’s the

Well, 52(b) says the consequence of

In summation, I do maintain that since District of

21

Columbia law affords relief here, the decision of the U.S.

22

Court of Appeals rests on an adequate independent ground of

23

local law and must be affirmed on that basis.

24
25

But second, even if this Court reaches the
question that the government has raised in its petition, the
42

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

application of the cause and prejudice standard here is

2 entirely inappropriate since the application of that

3 standard is premised on a finding of a procedural default
4 which normally bars the claim.

And since that is not the

5 case with instructional errors, it would be inappropriate
6 for the Court to extend Davis,

Wainwright v. Sykes and

7 Francis v. Henderson to this kind of instructional error,
8 which the Court --

QUESTION:

9

Let me ask you one more question about

10 your local law argument.
11

Although the cases, the D.C.

cases, allowing collateral attack for plain error as a

12 matter of local law, which

you cite in your brief, do

13 certainly support that proposition, the way they state the
14 plain error standard in the quote on page 9 of your brief is
15 under the plain error standard apparently in the District,
16 "the error complained of must be so clearly prejudicial to
17 substantial rights as to jeopardize the very fairness and
18 integrity of the trial.”
19

Now, when you state it that way, it*s pretty much

20 like the 2255 standard, isn't it?
21

22 under

MB. SCHEMBEB:

Your Honor, the ultimate standard

District of Columbia law is whether there is a

23 probability of a miscarriage of justice.

I would note that

24 the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Frady decision invoked that
25 very standard and held that on the facts of this case, these
43

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

instructional errors created a probability of a miscarriage

2 of justice because they meant that Mr. Frady may have been
3

improperly convicted of murder when he was only guilty of

4

manslaughter.
Now, this was the point that I was discussing

5

6

previously; there is division of opinion among the judges as

7

to whether in fact the evidence in this case on the question

8

of malice is such that there was sufficient prejudice to

9

warrant relief under that kind of a miscarriage of justice

10

standard.

That is a question which is nicely balanced among

11

the judges, and under the Fisher case should not be

12

disturbed by this Court.
JUSTICE BRENNANi

13

You have three minutes, Mr Frey.

14

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW I. FREY, ESQ.

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - Rebuttal

16

MR. FREY:

Thank you, Mr. Justice Brennan.

17

Let me start off by putting out to Mr. Justice

18

Stevens that the case that you were looking at was a direct

19

review case.

20

which I think is a complete red herring, in our reply

21

brief.

22

in the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case that

23

remotely suggests that they would apply a different rule if

24

this case had arisen as a result of a murder on the Capitol

25

grounds or some other federal enclave in the District of

We have addressed this question of local law,

Let me just say that first of all, there is nothing

44

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Columbia

2

Secondly, there is nothing in the decisions of the

3

local courts that remotely suggests that they would excuse a

4

procedural default on collateral attack.

5

decisions are saying that they are going to strictly enforce

6

procedural defaults on direct appeal, and only consider

7

under the plain error standard a very limited category of

8

cases.

9

into an understanding that they would be very liberal with

10

What there is are

It is difficult, I think impossible, to convert that

such claims on collateral attack.

11

Now, with regard to the question that Sr. Justice

12

Brennan asked whether this is like an adequate state ground

13

claim, it is not like an adequate state ground claim because

14

the District of Columbia courts are not state courts, and in

15

fact, the United States Supreme Court is the highest

16

expositor of District of Columbia law, even local law

17

questions, as I learned somewhat to my chagrin in the Whalen

18

case a few years ago —

19

QUESTIONi

But there are a number of our cases,

20

aren't there, Kr. Frey, which have suggested a reluctance to

21

review pure questions of District of Columbia law?

22

MR. FREY:

Well, but as I say, the last --

23

QUESTION:

Well, Miller and United States, Fisher

24
25

and a number of others —
MR. FREY:

There are cases, Southall Realty.
45

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

But

1

in Whalen there was no reluctance to review a purely local

2

law question.

The point is you can review it.

3

In this case I don’t think it's material because --

4

QUESTION*

5

Well, nothing I said suggests that we

can't review it.
MR. FREY*

No, I understand that, but I'm just

8

QUESTION*

But we’ve been very reluctant to.

9

MR. FREY;

I'm just saying it is a little

6
7

10

saying --

different from an independent state ground question.
Now, on the question of harmless error, the

11

12

question that Justice O'Connor asked, I do think that it may

13

have been that if this objection had been preserved at trial

14

and raised on direct appeal, there would be arguably be a

15

close question I think as to whether the error would be

16

harmless and the conviction ought nevertheless to be

17

affirmed.

18

The instuction on manslaughter was given because

19

there was some evidence which the jury might not have

20

credited about premeditation involving the driving by the

21

premises beforehand, the picking up and putting on gloves

22

before they went into the premises, the conversation at the

23

restaurant and so on.

24
25

Now, let me close on the question of futility and
the point about the effect of a failure to appeal.

I don’t

often quote Justice Douglas but in this case I think his

2 words in Sunal

3

v.

Large are appropriate.

He discussed the question of assumed futility and

4 he said he did not think -- I see my time is up, so you can
5 read it for yourselves.

Thank you.
