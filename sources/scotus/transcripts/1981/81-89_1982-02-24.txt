ORAL ARGUMENT OF DARYL A. ROBINSON, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBINSON:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, the case before the Court at this time

10

involves a death sentence of Alpha Stephens which

11

Petitioner here contends was lawfully imposed under the

12

death penalty statute enacted by the Georgia General

13

Assembly.

14

As this Court, I am sure, is aware, Georgia's

15

present death penalty law under which Respondent

16

Stephens was convicted and sentenced to death was a

17

response to the concerns voiced by this Court in another

18

Georgia case, Furman.

19

dealt with the unbridled discretion which was vested —

20

which this Court perceived was vested in the jury at

21

that time on the issue of whether or not a death penalty

22

could be imposed.

The concerns expressed there

23

The statute which was enacted as a response

24

recognizes ten narrowly drawn circumstances, commonly

25

referred to as the statutory aggravating circumstances,
3

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

and upon a finding of one of those ten circumstances, a

2

jury in Georgia is authorized to consider imposing the

3

death penalty.

4

In this particular case at trial, the evidence

5

before the jury at the first or guilt phase showed that

6

Respondent Stephens was lawfully confined under some

7

earlier sentences, that he escaped from lawful

8

confinement, and that while he was on escape, he went on

9

what can only be described as a crime spree, generally

10

around the Bleckley County up to the Macon area, and the

11

crime spree culminated in the -- in a burglarly, and

12

then an armed robbery, and a kidnapping, and ultimately

13

in the murder by Respondent Stephens of a crippled man,

14

Roy Asbell.

15

Part of the evidence introduced at that phase

16

against Respondent Stephens was his confession.

Upon

17

all the jury that was presented -- Upon all the evidence

18

that was presented to the jury at the guilt phase of

19

trial, the jury found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

20

Immediately thereafter, it went into the second phase of

21

Georgia’s bifurcated procedure, the sentencing phase.

22

Generally, in Georgia, our sentencing phase

23

allows the jury to consider all of the evidence which

24

was before it during the initial stage of the trial, the

25

guilt stage.

That was done in this case, and the jury
4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

was so instructed, that they could consider that.

Also,

2

Georgia law allows the introduction of other evidence at

3

the sentencing phase, both in extenuation, mitigation,

4

or in aggravation.

5

Now, the aggravating evidence which may be

6

introduced at this part of the trial, the sentencing

7

phase of the trial, is not limited by Georgia law to

8

those ten circumstances which are set forth in

9

27-2534.1, the so-called ten statutory aggravating

10

circumstances.

11

law for non-statutory aggravating circumstances to be

12

introduced into evidence at that phase of the trial, and

13

particular reference is made in Georgia Code Section

14

27-2503 to a prior criminal conviction or convictions of

15

a defendant which may be placed into evidence at the

16

sentencing phase of the trial if the district attorney

17

has given notice prior to trial of his intent to tender

18

evidence of such convictions.

19

Specific provision is made in Georgia

That was done in this case.

At the sentencing

20

phase of the trial, therefore, the evidence before the

21

jury was the rather gruesome nature of the crime itself,

22

the prior convictions, certified copies of which were

23

introduced by the district attorney, and also in

24

mitigation, I presume, the testimony of Respondent

25

Stephens himself, who took the stand and generally
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

admitted a participation in the crime, but denied

2

actually having pulled the trigger himself in murding

3

Roy Asbell.

4

The trial judge instructed, and that

5

instruction is before the Court, of course, first of

6

all, that the jury was authorized to and should consider

7

all of the evidence before it.

8

instructed by the trial judge that the jury must find

9

one statutory aggravating circumstance before the jury

10

was authorized to consider imposing the death penalty.

11

And finally, the trial judge made it clear to the jury

12

that even if a statutory aggravating circumstance was

13

found, a life sentence could be imposed.

14

was proper under Georgia law.

15

Second, the jury was

So, the charge

The jury considered that evidence, and

16

returned with a finding of two statutory aggravating

17

circumstances, which are (b)(1) and (b)(9).

18

effect is a two-part statutory aggravating circumstance,

19

dealing first with whether the defendant has a prior

20

record of capital felony offenses, and the second part

21

of (b)(1) is whether the defendant has a substantial

22

history of assaultive behavior.

23

(b)(1)

in

The case proceeded from there to the Georgia

24

Supreme Court for its mandatory statutory review, and

25

the Georgia Supreme Court determined that the sentence
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

imposed was not imposed under an influence of passion,

2

prejudice, or other arbitrary factor, that it was

3

neither disproportionate nor excessive to other

4

sentences imposed in similar cases, but the Georgia

5

Supreme Court did indicate that in an earlier decision

6

of Arnold v. State, that portion of aggravating --

7

statutory aggravating circumstance be one which involved

8

showing a substantial history of assaultive behavior had

9

been declared vague by that court and could not standing

10

alone serve as the basis in Georgia for authorizing the

11

jury to consider imposing the death penalty.
The Supreme Court did determine that there

12
13

were the other two statutory aggravating circumstances,

14

either one of which would authorize the jury to proceed

15

to consider whether the death penalty was warranted.

QUESTIONi

2

Ordinarily, are we not bound by the

3

construction given to a state statute by the highest

4

court of the state?
HR. ROBINSON;

5

I think so, Your Honor, and I

6

think in part of the opinion, in some of the other

7

issues that were raised below in the Fifth Circuit, the

8

court of appeals did recognize that principle, and felt

9

themselves bound by it.

10

In this particular instance,

this single issue, they did not.
The Fifth Circuit's opinion is based upon two

11
12

things, both of which Petitioner contends are

13

erroneous.

14

determined that this Court’s opinion in Stromberg v.

15

California was applicable in the context of the

16

sentencing phase of a death penalty case.

17

not applicable to the circumstances in this case before

18

the Court for several reasons.

19

First of all, the court of appeals

Stromberg is

First of all, in Stromberg, the Court was

20

concerned with a general verdict of guilt which had been

21

imposed on the defendant in a sedition case under

22

California's -- there was a three-proned sedition

23

statute in that state, one of which was clearly

24

unconstitutional and could not serve as the basis for a

25

conviction.

The jury returned a verdict simply of
8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

guilty, and the reviewing court and this Court

2

determined that you could not tell from that simple

3

verdict whether the jury had made its decision in whole

4

or in part on an unconstitutional portion of the statute.

5

The case now before the Court is a different

6

case for a couple of reasons.

First of all, we are

7

talking about a specialized procedure, the sentencing

8

phase of a bifurcated death penalty trial, but second,

9

and I think more important is that the jury did return

10

specific findings in this case.

11

divide (b)(1) into the two subparts — the jury found

12

both of them — then there were actually three statutory

13

aggravating circumstances which the jury found to exist

14

beyond a reasonable doubt.

15

The jury found if you

Under Georgia law, any one circumstance serves

16

the function with which this Court was concerned in

17

Furman, that is, to narrow the class of cases for which

18

the death penalty can be imposed.

19

one is not sentenced to death because he has a

20

multiplicity of statutory aggravating circumstances.

21

aggravating — a statutory aggravating circumstance

22

authorizes the jury to consider imposing the death

23

penalty, bat if the death penalty is imposed, it is

24

imposed not because the jury finds statutory aggravating

25

circumstance (b)(1).

Under Georgia law,

It is imposed because all of the

phase of the trial leads the jury to conclude that the

death penalty is appropriate.

5

a reasonable doubt that a statutory aggravating

circumstance exists.

The discretion has

7

If you will, the circumstance itself set forth

8

in the statute simply serves as a bridge to get the jury

9

from this point of the general class of murders to this

10

point, having narrowed the focus of the jury’s attention

11

on that particular class of murders which the General

12

Assembly of the State of Georgia has determined warrant

13

the death penalty.
QUESTION*

14

Has the Georgia Supreme Court ever

15

articulated the matter like this?

16

MR. ROBINSON;

The Georgia Supreme Court

17

implicitly has made that holding, not only in this case

18

but in several other cases over the last few years, Your

19

Honor.

20

QUESTION:

Of course, if you thought for a

21

moment that the jury imposed the death penalty because

22

it added up three aggravating circumstances, and

23

decided, well, all of them together justify the death

24

penalty, but it might have been that if there was only

25

one or two of them, they might have come to a different

conclusion
MR. ROBINSON;

2

No, Your Honor.

3

understand the question, I don't think so.

4

all --

5

QUESTION;

6

MR. ROBINSON:

7

QUESTION;

If I
First of

Well -Excuse me.

-- couldn't you say that that is

8

true and still defend the result here by just saying

9

that under Georgia law the Georgia Supreme Court can

10
11

have an independent view of the death penalty?
MR. ROBINSON;

And that is what occurs in this

12

case, but let me point out one thing that I think is

13

crucial to a determination of this case.

14

evidence that the jury considered —

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. ROBINSON:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. ROBINSON:

That is, the

T understand.
-- was properly before the jury.

Yes.
There was not a single piece of

19

the evidence, either in support of the circumstance

20

declared unconstitutional in another case or any other

21

circumstance, which was not properly before the jury and

22

considered by it.

23

QUESTION:

Well, what is the jury's

24

instruction in Georgia, that if you find these

25

aggravating circumstances, you should consider whether
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the death penalty should be imposed based on all the

2

evidence?

3

Is that it, or not?
MR. ROBINSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's an

4

accurate summation of what the instruction would be.

5

First of all, generally, and in this case in particular,

6

the jury is told they must consider all the evidence

7

before it, either in aggravation or in mitigation.

8

the jury is instructed, and was in this case, that if

9

they found one -- that they could not impose the death

Then

10

penalty unless they found at least one statutory

11

aggravating circumstance, and then thereafter even if

12

that circumstance is found to exist, they are not

13

mandated to impose the death penalty.

14
15

QUESTION:

Counsel, the instruction isn’t

phrased that way, is it?

16

HR, ROBINSON:

17

in those precise terms.

18

QUESTION:

The instruction is not phrased

I mean, your theory seems to be one

19

that certainly would be plausible, but it doesn't seem

20

to be spelled out that way to the jury in the

21

instructions.

22

MR. ROBINSON:

Your Honor, the instruction

23

reads that, "If you recommend mercy," and I am reading

24

from the Joint Appendix at Page 18, "If you recommend

25

mercy for the defendant, this will result in
12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

imprisonment for life of the defendant.

2

would not be necessary for you to recite any mitigating

3

or aggravating circumstances as you may find."

4

courts below which have considered that very question on

5

the issue of this instruction have indicated that that

6

is a proper instruction and was sufficient to indicate

7

to the jury that they could find an aggravating

8

circumstance and still not return a death penalty, and

9

so I think it is clear.
QUESTION;

10

In such case it

And the

Georgia's --

Is it also your position that the

11

Georgia Supreme Court could determine sentencing de

12

novo, regardless of what the jury did?
NR. ROBINSON;

13

Your Honor, I am not sure if I

14

understand the precise -- a precise factual situation.

15

I think my answer to that would be no.

16

function of the Georgia Supreme Court, to sentence the

17

defendant.

18

and the purpose of Georgia's statutory review is simply

19

to determine whether that was imposed under passion,

20

prejudice, or some other arbitrary factor, and that was

21

done in this case.

22

That is not the

That is peculiarly the function of the jury,

They conducted that review.

I think Georgia's statutes also contemplate

23

that same interpretation or the interpretation that we

24

are giving this in Georgia Code Ann. Section 26-3102.

25

will read just briefly.

"A sentence of death shall not
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

I

1

be imposed unless the jury verdict includes a finding of

2

at least one statutory aggravating circumstance and a

3

recommendation that such sentence be imposed."

4

the clear reading of the statute, it appears to me that

5

that is vhat our statute contemplates, and that

6

obviously has been the interpretation given to it by our

7

supreme court.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION*

So, from

In your view, if they give three or

four, and one of them is a valid one, the others are
irrelevant.

Is that it?

MR. ROBINSON*

They are irrelevant to the

12

determination of whether the jury can consider imposing

13

the death penalty.

14

into another question in another case of the type of

15

evidence which was admitted in support of those

16

statutory aggravating circumstances, but that is not a

17

question before the Court, because in this case the

18

evidence considered by the jury was properly before the

19

jury, and the convictions were -- there is no question --

20

QUESTION*

Yes, sir.

Now, that would get you

The Fifth Circuit — the Fifth

21

Circuit apparently, as I read the opinion, thought that

22

the consideration of the evidence on prior conduct

23

generally had an undue and inappropriate impact on the

24

weight of the record of convictions.

25

MR. ROBINSON*

Is that about it?

That is about the gist of their
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

amended opinion.

Their first opinion, as we pointed out

2

to the Court, was simply a wrong interpretation of

3

Georgia law.

4

evidence was not properly considered by the jury,

5

because it was in support of the unconstitutionally

6

vague circumstance, and therefore they should not have

7

considered it.

8

was granted.

9

thereafter said, well, so the evidence was properly

10

before the jury, but perhaps they considered it too

11

much.

The court below indicated that this

We petitioned for rehearing, and that
The opinion was changed, and they

That in effect is what the opinion said.
QUESTION:

12

In talking about the role of the

13

Georgia Supreme Court, at least you have to say, don't

15

this case and in others that the jury would not have

24

MR. ROBINSON*

25

QUESTION:

That's correct.

I would agree.

And they have in a lot of other

1

cases

2

ME. ROBINSON:

I would agree, Your Honor.

Yes.

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

4

QUESTION:

Counsel, as you read this Court's

5

decision in Gregg, do you think that the Gregg opinions

6

assume that the aggravating circumstances that are

7

enumerated by the sentencer will in fact guide the

8

discretion?

9

MR. ROBINSON:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think I was

10

about -- I think I was anticipating Your Honor's

11

question, and was going to give you a different answer.

12

The purpose of a charge on the statutory aggravating

13

circumstances is, yes, to guide the discretion of the

14

jury in determining whether this case falls within the

15

class of cases for which a death penalty may be imposed,

16

but I don't think either the Georgia General Assembly or

17

this Court in its review in Gregg of the law as enacted

18

contemplated that a finding of a statutory aggravating

19

circumstance mandated a death penalty.

20

QUESTION:

No, but do you think that Gregg

21

assumes that the jury, for instance in this case, would

22

be guided by the presence or absence of the enumerated

23

aggravating circumstances?

24
25

MR. ROBINSON:

Your Honor, guided in the sense

that it would tell the jury whether if the evidence
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

supported that circumstance they could impose the death

2

penalty, but not in the sense that the court below

3

viewed it, as giving some kind of undue weight to the

4

evidence which supported it.

5

In that regard, as I have said, the evidence

6

was properly before the jury, and I am not sure a jury

7

can give undue weight to admissible evidence.

8

some point in any case, and in a death case, I think,

9

where there is some — some discretion which remains in

There is

10

the jury, and I think this Court recognized that in

11

Gregg, and Lockett, and in all the death penalty cases

12

that the Court has decided in recent times.

13

think the purpose was to eliminate the jury’s discretion

14

entirely.

I don’t

15

I also think that this Court understood, as I

16

read the opinion in Gregg, I think that the majority of

17

the Court understood that the purpose was just as I have

18

stated, that there was a dual finding by a jury once you

19

got to the sentencing phase, and again, I use my

20

argument of the bridge.

21

aggravating circumstance which gets the jury into the

22

class of case for which they can consider all of the

23

evidence.

24
25

You have your statutory

Now -QUESTION:

And you think that is what the

majority in this Court was articulating in Gregg?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE,, S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. ROBINSON:

1

I think that's one thing that

2

this Court understood, yes, I certainly do, in that

3

opinion.

4

than one case, that the function of the death penalty

5

phase of a trial is to enable a jury to make a rational

6

and intelligent decision on whether the death penalty is

7

appropriate based upon the offense which was committed

8

and the character of the person who committed the

9

offense.

Since then, the Court has indicated, in more

Again, the evidence which was placed in

10

aggravation at the sentencing phase assisted the jury in

11

doing just that.

12

on just exactly what sort of defendant they were dealing

13

with.

It was evidence on the character of the defendant.
Mr. Chief Justice, I will reserve any

14
15

remaining time.
QUESTION:

16
17

It gave the jury some further guidance

Let me just ask you one more

question.

18

MR. ROBINSON:

19

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Is there -- do you suppose the

20

necessity to find one or more of the specified or

21

charged aggravating circumstances would make admissible

22

evidence at the penalty trial that otherwise might not

23

be admissible?

24
25

I can ask the question another way.

Do you

suppose ever invalidating an aggravating circumstance

18

would mean that a certain category of evidence that had

2

been admitted was not admissible at all?

3
4

7

HR. ROBINSON*

It’s conceivable that that

could happen, yes.
QUESTION*

But you are careful in this case to

say that that wasn't so.
HR. ROBINSON*

It is not true in this case.

8

And again. Your Honor, I think the very reason that a

9

statutory aggravating circumstance might be invalidated,

10

except for the particular one we are dealing with here,

11

would in all likelihood be because either of a failure

12

of evidence to support it or because some part of the

13

evidence which was introduced in support of the

14

circumstance was not properly --

15

QUESTION;

Well, the prosecution might charge

16

a whole list of aggravating circumstances, and the jury

17

might only find one, but that wouldn't mean that the

18

evidence as to aggravating circumstances that weren't

19

found was inadmissible.

20

MR. ROBINSON;

That's correct, and let me

21

point out, Your Honor, that the prosecution doesn't

22

charge, nor does the prosecution decide what statutory

23

aggravating circumstances are charged.

24
25

QUESTION*

The judge --

Well, but the jury is certainly

instructed as to what they are.

MR. ROBINSONs

3

By the judge.

Yes, that's

correct.
QUESTION;

Yes.

Well, suppose there was an

4

instance that you say you could conceive of, where the

5

invalidation of an aggravating circumstance would mean

6

that a certain part of the evidence before the jury was

7

absolutely inadmissible.

8
9

10
11

MR. ROBINSON;

That wouldn't require an

automatic vacating of a death penalty, but that would
require some further review —
QUESTION;

Then you would really get up

12

against as to what the supreme court would say, whether

13

the jury would arrive at the same conclusion or not.

14

MR. ROBINSON;

15

QUESTION;

16
17

You would get closer --

And whether that was consistent

with Georgia law or not.
MR. ROBINSON;

You would get closer to

18

requiring the reviewing court to intervene in the

19

province of the jury.

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. ROBINSON;

22

Yes.
And I think it would be

necessitated under those circumstances.

23

QUESTION;

Counsel, may I ask you one question?

24

MR. ROBINSON;

25

QUESTION;

Yes, sir.

Under Georgia law, would it be
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

error to charge on an aggravating circumstance with

2

respect to which no evidence had been introduced?

3

te Georgia court ever faced that question?

4

MR. ROBINSON:

Has

Your Honor, I don’t believe —

5

in my knowledge, that -- a particular case involving

6

that has not arisen.

7

shouldn't assume, since our court hasn’t said whether it

8

is or is not.

9

QUESTION:

I would assume — well, I

In a way, that might be what

10

happened here.

11

it, they shouldn't have charged, and had they known that

12

the circumstance was invalid they wouldn’t have charged

13

on that circumstance.

14

Although there is evidence supporting

MR. ROBINSON:

Well -- oh, of course, and had

15

the Arnold case been decided before trial in this

16

instance, the trial judge would simply have charged on

17

the first part of (b)(1).

18

I would like to point out one other thing

19

before I rest.

That is, the evidence which was

20

submitted in support of (b)(1) even now, after Arnold

21

has struck down a portion of (b)(1), would still be

22

admissible, because the first part of our first

23

statutory aggravating circumstance allows you to

24

introduce evidence of prior capital felony convictions,

25

and the two armed robberies involved and the murder
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1
2

would come in under the first prong of that statute.
So, even after Arnold, that evidence is still

3

admissible, and it is still admissible under (b)(1).

4

The burglaries would not have come in under (b)(1)

5

anyway, because generally that is not assaultive

6

behavior, and they would come in under 27-2503, and the

7

district attorney must have presumed he was submitting

8

them under 2503, because he tendered notice to the

9

defendant prior to trial as that statute requires.

10

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE.*

12

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN CHARLES BOGER, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13
14

Mr. Boger.

MR. BOGER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

15

please the Court, let me begin by restating the central

16

fact of this case, which is that Alpha Stephens' jury

17

received an erroneous jury instruction which misguided

18

their deliberations on the question of whether he should

19

receive a life sentence or a death sentence.

20

The State of Georgia has conceded this point,

21

as they must, since the record makes it clear that the

22

instruction was given, that the jury was guided by it,

23

indeed, that they expressly relied upon it, at least in

24

part, in imposing a decision to give Mr. Stephens a

25

death sentence.

The question presented -22

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

QUESTION:

1

2

In effect, did the Georgia Supreme

Court say that that was irrelevant?
HR. BOGERi

3

The Georgia Supreme Court, Mr.

4

Chief Justice, made two determinations necessarily in

5

its opinion in Stephens on appeal.
QUESTION:

6

Well, almost necessarily, too, they

7

had to decide that what you have just said was

8

irrelevant.
MR. BOGER:

9

The first -- the first

10

determination they made is that the instruction was

11

erroneous, and should not have been given.

12

one, which I submit is a constitutional determination,

13

made without reflection, without any express discussion

14

by the court, is that this erroneous instruction made no

15

difference.

16

you that they did determine it was irrelevant, and I

17

think that presents —

19

So, yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I agree with

QUESTION:

18

The second

Would that be another way of saying

it was harmless error?
MR. BOGER:

was harm.

They only said that since there were two

That presents the kind of questions which I

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

raised in the Stromberg line of cases, raised in fact in

2

this Court's opinion --

3

QUESTION*

Let me put to you the question I

4

put to your friend.

5

construction given to a state statute by the highest

6

court of the state?

Ordinarily, are we not bound by the

NR. BOGER*

7

You are bound by constructions of

8

the statute insofar as they do not rest upon a federal

9

constitutional ground.

My submission is that the

10

Supreme Court of Georgia as a statutory matter

11

determined that this was an erroneous instruction.

12

constitutional matter, it determined that that made no

13

difference.

14

ground.

15

submission is that Stromberg versus California and the

16

line of cases that flow from that case, and the Eighth

17

Amendment cases, Gregg and Gardner and Beck, and so

18

forth, make it clear that that judgment, the

19

constitutional judgment is wrong.

20

As a

It did not articulate that as a statutory

It simply said, that makes no difference.

Our

The question presented for this Court, I

21

submit, is whether a death sentence admittedly imposed

22

in partial reliance upon an impermissible factor can be

23

allowed to stand.

24

precedent, of course, for many juries have been

25

misinstructed in the past, and as I mentioned in

This is not a question wholly without

24

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C, 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

responding, Mr. Chief Justice, to your earlier argument,

2

this Court has developed a general rule over the past 50

3

years to govern just this question.

4

The rule is as follows.

If it is possible

5

that the jury's verdict rests in whole or in part on an

6

unconstitutional or impermissible ground, if an

7

appellate court, in other words, cannot assure itself

8

that the impermissible factor did not play a part in the

9

jury's determination to reach that verdict, then the

10

verdict must be set aside, and another properly

11

instructed jury must reconsider the issue.

12

The irony of the State of Georgia's position

13

before this Court is that it must somehow contend that

14

this general rule, widely employed in state and federal

15

criminal cases, should not be employed in Mr. Stephens'

16

case, that somehow a lower standard must govern.

17

QUESTION;

May I interrupt you with a question?

18

MR. BOGER:

19

QUESTION;

Surely.
Supposing that we set aside the

20

verdict or the penalty, sent it back for another trial

21

on the penalty phase, and the jury again returned a

22

death penalty verdict on the two permissible statutory

23

aggravating circumstances, and they had the same

24

evidence before them they had here.

25

footnote to their verdict and said, we also relied on

Then they added a

the fact that in our judgment this man had an assaultive

2

history, or whatever the language is of the

3

impermissible aggravating circumstance.

4

permissible thing for them to do?

5
6
7

MR. BOGER*

I am sorry.

Would that be a

Absent an instruction

by the judge on the impermissible —
QUESTION*

That’s right, but the same evidence

8

went in, and the jury -- and maybe the prosecutor

9

argued, because the argument need not be limited to the

10

specific aggravating circumstances, as I understand it,

11

just argued that one of the reasons you should consider

12

sentencing this man to death is that history shows, and

13

then they use the language of the impermissible

14

circumstance.

15
16

MR. BOGERs

Well, assuming those facts, there

would be no constitutional violation.

17

QUESTION*

Now, how is this case different?

18

MR. BOGER*

This case is different because

19

what the instruction given to the jury did was focus the

20

jury’s attention on this factor, this substantial

21

history, if one would, of serious criminal conviction.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION*

What in the instruction focuses the

jury on that fact?
MR. BOGER*

Well, let's look at the

instruction, at Pages 18 and 19 of the Appendix, because
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

I think it is important to be aware of the extent to

2

which the statutory aggravating circumstances under this

3

instruction are the focus of the jury's entire

4

deliberation.

5

one point on Page 18 the judge briefly says, you may

6

consider any of the aggravating or mitigating factors

7

before you.
But then, he lists in order each of the

QUESTION;

2

But the focus in the instruction

3

is, unless one or more of these is found to have been

4

proven, you cannot impose the death penalty.

5

MR. BOGER;

6

QUESTION:

That's correct, Your Honor.
It doesn't say that the number of

7

aggravating circumstances which you find shall affect

8

your deliberations on whether to impose the death

9

penalty.

10

Or do you read it that way?
MR. BOGER:

One of the deficiencies of the

11

Georgia statutory scheme is that it is not made clear,

12

and certainly this charge does not make clear to a jury

13

exactly what it is supposed to do with these statutory

14

aggravating circumstances in its deliberations.

15

however, not at all unreasonable to suppose that the

16

jury in the jury room will be guided by the attention

17

that has been focused on these three factors which the

18

foreman himself must write out one by one if they find.

19

QUESTION:

It is,

Well, hasn't the Georgia Supreme

20

Court, though, in effect said that the aggravating

21

circumstances just — they serve the purpose of telling

22

the jury when you can consider the death penalty?

MR. BOGER:

MR. BOGER:

has answered incorrectly the constitutional matter, the

9

effect of an impermissible factor being fed into the

10

jury's deliberations.

11

of Georgia when it came before this Court in Gregg was

12

that the statutory aggravating circumstances which had

13

been enumerated by the legislature would guide the

14

jury’s discretion, would take it away from an unfettered

15

consideration of all of the evidence that had been

16

presented at the sentencing phase —

that would probably be unconstitutional, because it

would have told the jury that it could not rely on

considerations articulated by the legislature as to the

11

particular factors which serve cumulatively to aggravate

12

a capital -- or a murder, and to make it -- In other

13

words, while the jury's processes are something that we

14

cannot retrospectively know, it is certainly reasonable

15

to assume, and now I am trying to draw on the line that

16

this Court developed in the Sandstrom versus Montana

17

case, it would certainly be reasonable for a juror

18

presented with the instruction that is here on Pages 18

19

and 19, sitting in a jury room, asked to write out every

20

aggravating circumstance that it found, to conclude that

21

the more aggravating circumstances that are found, the

22

more aggravated a case this is, and the more likely it

23

is that the legislature makes a judgment that this is a

case in which death is warranted.

MR. ROGER;

I don't believe that is what the

you think it says?
MR. BOGER;

It holds simply as a matter of law

8

that the vardict is unimpaired, and it is our judgment

9

that that is a constitutional question.

10
11

12

QUESTION;

All right.

All right.

Any way you

want to put it.
QUESTION;

Didn't it necessarily hold that if

13

one — if one ground is valid, the position of the

14

others, no matter how many or how few, is irrelevant, or

15

harmless error, or whatever?

16

MR. BOGER;

It necessarily held that, yes, Mr.

17

Chief Justice.

But that question itself impinges on

18

constitutional values.

19

supreme court could not simply hold that the failure to

charge on an element of the crime would not require

21

reversal just because the state supreme court says so.

22

Indeed, Justice Frankfurter in the Bollenbach case,

which we have cited in our brief, makes the point that

24

the appellate court cannot simply read guilt out of the

record, that proper standards must guide a jury's

on an essential element of the case, there is no way

matter of fiat or as a matter of state statutory

construction *

6

This is not — this is not a case that

presents a statutory construction phase — issue.

It is

8

a case in which the issue is whether one can disregard

9

what is an admittedly erroneous finding which the jury

10

made in reliance upon an instruction which should not

11

have been given, which entered into its calculus in some

12

way that we cannot retrospectively determine in deciding

13

whether Kr. Stephens should live or die.

14

The whole thrust of this Court's Eighth

15

Amendment jurisprudence is that the information given to

16

the jury at a sentencing phase is not itself sufficient,

17

that there needs be, that there must be careful guidance

18

of the jury in its deliberations, as the opinion of

19

Justices Stephens and Powell and Stewart for the Court

20

said in Gregg, and if I may be permitted a short quote,

21

that "The provision of relevant iformation under fair

22

procedural rules is not alone sufficient to guarantee

23

that the information will be properly used, since

24

members of a jury have very little experience in

25

sentencing, they are unfamiliar and unlikely to be

skilled in dealing with the information they are given."
The response that this Court identified as

2
3

Georgia’s response, which it approved in Gregg, was the

4

provision of guided jury discretion, telling the jury

5

exactly what factors, as it put it, "the state

6

representing organized society deems particularly

7

relevant to the sentencing decision."
And the Court in Gregg went on to point out

8
9

that it would be virtually unthinkable to follow any

10

other course in a system governed by prior precedents

and fixed rules of law.

MR. BOGERs

As an Eighth Amendment matter,

10

there may be somewhat more problems, because an

Mr. Boger, may I just as this one

question?

Is it correct that you are really not arguing

that it would be impermissible for them to rely on the

10

assaultive behavior which would be described in that

aggravating circumstance?

12

argument, it is that they have perhaps mistakenly relied

13

on the fact that the legislature thinks that is a

14

special reason for imposing the death sentence?

MR. BOGER;

20

We have not taken that position in

this case.

That's correct.

But the entire purpose of

22

jury instruction, and certainly these instructions, was

23

to focus their attention, in effect communicate them —

24

to them something about what the State of Georgia,

25

organized society thought made this case specially

It is because of that impermissible factor

whose weight we cannot know, but whose weight we can

assume, at least with respect to some reasonable jurors,

4

made a difference, that we must reverse —

Mr. Boger, a number of times you

have spoken of the -- that the Court in Gregg said so

7

and so.

MR. BOGER;

That's correct, Your Honor.

I was

speaking of an opinion by three Members for the Court.
But in Justice White's opinion --

11
12

That isn’t technically correct, is it?

QUESTION;

Well, three Members can't speak for

the Court, as Justice Blackmun has just implied.

Three

13 Members speak for three Members in a plurality.
14
15

MR. BOGER;

Justice White's opinion, as well,

though, for three additional Members of the Court also

16 highlighted and underlined the role that guided jury
17 discretion as a guarantor that the arbitrariness, the
18 capriciousness which had been identified by this Court
19 in Furman would not recur.

It was precisely the role of

20 the statutory aggravating circumstances to channel, to
21

confine within boundries the jury's deliberation about

22 those factors which should be most important in its
23 judgment.
24

Justice White and, I guess, Chief Justice —

that?

23

MR. BOGER;

How do you handle

Resentencings in Georgia are a

24

common occurrence, in cases in which for one reason or

25

another the sentencing proceeding is reversed.

There

That would present no serious

The real — the real question before the

6

7

Court, which the state has attempted to avoid by two

8

arguments, is whether, as I have stated before, once we

9

are certain that an impermissible factor has interjected

10

itself, and lacking assurance as to how this factor

11

affected the jury, we can uphold that sentencing verdict.
The State of Georgia has proposed one argument

12

13

to avoid this question by saying that the evidence was

14

before the court and therefore, does it make any

15

difference that the sentencing instruction was

16

inappropriate?

17

thrust that we have discussed over the last 15 minutes

18

of the role of sentencing instructions in a capital

19

case, the function of focusing the jury's attention on

matters that the state considers particularly important,

and should guide the jury's deliberations to avoid

22

arbitrariness.

That argument, though, misses the whole

So, that argument really cannot be

circumstances themselves suffice, and therefore we need

determine in retrospect how it may have carried out that

responsibility and weighed the impermissible factor

together with those which were permissible.

The

Therefore, we are left with the central

10

question.

When we know the death penalty has been

imposed in part on an impermissible ground, may that

sentence be affirmed?

14

which we have relied in our brief and rely here today

15

are the Fourteenth Amendment ground first articulated by

16

this Court in Stromberg versus California, where the

17

Court held that if we cannot know but that the jury may

must reverse.

7

unconstitutional.

8
9

MR. BOGER;

The factor you are talking

That is not

Well, the Georgia Supreme Court

has held that that factor itself introduces

10

impermissible arbitrariness, and therefore that factor

11

should not be considered.

QUESTION;

Did they say it should not be

3

considered, or could not serve as a jurisdictional

4

predicate for the death sentence?

5

7

MR. BOGER;

As a factor, I think they made it

clear that it should not have been charged.
QUESTION;

Does that mean that if there were a

8

retrial — now, here you have two theories for

9

admissibility, but if there were no -- say there was

20

evidence that would tend to show that the person was a

21

particularly bad man and ought to die, such as prior

22

assaultive behavior, but there is no statutory

23

aggravating circumstance that describes the evidence of

24

that character.

QUESTION:

And I suppose as a matter of

federal law anything goes at a sentencing hearing,

MR. BOGER:

I am not convinced as a

12 constitutional matter that is the case.

We mentioned in

13 our brief the Fifth Circuit has recently decided a case
14

involving somewhat different circumstances in Florida,

15 holding that under the Eighth Amendment, that non -16 evidence of non-statutory aggravating factors may not be
17 admitted.

We have not relied on that argument on behalf

18 of Mr. Stephens, and have conceded for purposes of this
19

case that the Georgia statute certainly would have

20 permitted the evidence which came in here.
21

Beyond, then, the Stromberg line extended to

22 Street, made in effect clearer than Street, because we
23 have the special sentencing verdict which shows us -24 the special sentencing finding which shows us that Mr.
25 Stephens' jury did rely upon an impermissible factor, we
