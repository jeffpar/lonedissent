CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*

I think you may proceed

when you*ra ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD C. ROBINSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ROBINSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;

8

The events giving rise to this litigation

9

began almost ten years ago in Butte, Montana when a

10

self-employed contractor conceived what he believed to

11

be a better idea for the construction of homes.

12

However, within a few months after he began his

13

operation of a new modular home plan, his business

14

became the victim of a secondary boycott and

15

jurisdictional dispute picketing conducted by the

16

respondent union.

17

Because of the exigent circumstances created

18

by that activity, which I will describe in a moment,

19

Summit Valley was forced to make expenditures of money

20

in the form of legal fees and related expenses in order

21

to stop the activity.

22

is whether the victim of an illegal secondary boycott is

23

entitled to its attorneys* fees and related expenses of

24

litigation which were incurred by it to successfully

25

effect a cessation of the boycott and the resumption of

Thus, the question for decision

1

the enterprise in order to mitigate the harm caused by

2

that activity as compensatory damages under Section 303

3

of the Labor Management Relations Act.

4

The question presented here is crucial for the

5

small employer in the Ninth Circuit who is faced with

6

the dilemma of either absorbing the losses caused by the

7

boycott or absorbing the losses caused by the

8

expenditure of his legal fees incurred to stop the

9

boycott.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

Nr. Robinson, did you suffer any

work stoppage at all?
NR. ROBINSON:

Yes.

The work stoppages

13

occurred at the homes of Summit Valley's customers when

14

the union went to those homes and threatened the

15

employees of contractors who were employed by the —

16

Summit Valley's customers to build foundations and

17

garages and ancillary structures.

18

stoppage did occur at that point, Your Honor.

And that work

19

In either case, either absorbing the loss of

20

the boycott or the legal fees, the financial resources

21

of a new business are eaten up and the business thus

22

becomes jeopardized.

23

in the Ninth Circuit, for an employer in that situation

24

is to capitulate to the illegal union demands.

25

position is that Section 303 was designed to obviate

And the only alternative, at least

Our

4

55 W

WASHINGTON n O 9nn9A (9CW\ K5A-93AR

1

2

that kind of a dilemma.
The facts relative to the dispute are,

3

briefly, Summit Valley had a labor agreement with Butte

4

Teamsters Local 2 which governed the terms and

5

conditions of employment of its employees, and those

6

employees engaged in an assembly line type of

7

homebuilding operation.

8

to contract with local contractors to have the necessary

9

on site footings and other ancillary structures built in

10
11

Retail customers were required

order to make the homes habitable.
The Carpenters Union objected to this

12

enterprise and boycotted, as I have just indicated.

13

Summit Valley’s customers by forcing its members to

14

cease performing work at those homes by threatening to

15

fine the union members, and in some cases did fine them.

16

Shortly thereafter, the union erected picket

17

lines at Summit Valley’s plant site itself, and as

18

consequence, retail customers refused to cross the

19

picket lines.

20

Summit Valley employed private attorneys to

21

take necessary action to remedy that conduct that was,

22

first, precluding customers from completing homes

23

already sold to them, and precluding Summit Valley’s

24

acquisition of potential new customers because of the

25

refusal of customers in the Butte, Montana area to cross

these picket lines.

2

Consequently, we filed an unfair labor

3

practice charge — charges with the NLRB, and we have

4

detailed in our brief the outline of those protracted

5

proceedings.

6

every level of the proceedings, including the Section

7

10K proceeding in which the NLRB awarded the work in

8

question to the Teamsters.

9

disclaim any further attempts to assert jurisdiction

Suffice it to say that we prevailed at

The Carpenters refused to

10

over that work.

And, in fact, even after the NLRB had

11

made its initial determinations, continued again to

12

threaten —: continued its threats to picket.
QUESTION;

13

Mr. Robinson, would you concede

14

that the American rule normally precludes recovery of

15

attorneys' fees as damages?

16

MR. ROBINSON;

17

QUESTION;

Yes.

That is the traditional —

So, all right.

Then what we have

18

to do, of course, I suppose is look at the use of the

19

word "damages” in Section 303(b), right?

20

MR. ROBINSON;

21

QUESTION;

That’s correct.

And determine whether Congress

22

intended to use the term in the normal way that it is

23

used or whether it had some other intention in mind,

24 right?
25

MR. ROBINSON;

That’s correct.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 12021 554-2345

QUESTION*

1

Okay.

Now, what is there in the

2

legislative history that would lead us to the conclusion

3

that Congress intended something other than the normal

4

rule?

5

MR. ROBINSON*

In Note 16 in Teamsters v.

6

Morton, the only other case I believe that this Court

7

has had before involving Section 303, the Court noted

8

that Senator Taft stated that one of the primary

9

purposes for his proposing the amendment, Section 303,

10

was to restore to people the monies they have lost as a

11

result of such jurisdictional and secondary boycott

12

activity.

13

QUESTION;

Hell, did he not also say that

14

under the Sherman Act the same question of boycott

15

damage is subject to a suit for damages and attorneys*

16

fees, but in this case we simply provide for the amount

17

of actual damages.
MR. ROBINSON*

18

That’s true, Justice O’Connor.

19

However, Senator Taft was speaking in that context to

20

whether Congress intended to award attorneys’ fees in

21

the 303 action itself.

22

contending that such attorneys’ fees were awarded in our

23

303 suit.

position, even recognized that distinction and indicated

2

in its decision that certainly that colloquy between

3

Senator Taft and Senator Morris did not really address

4

the issue of whether attorneys' fees in the context that

5

we have them here may or may not be considered as

6

damages, or whether they would be considered as the

7

damages or attorneys* fees.

9

simply did not address the question presented.

QUESTION:

And essentially all of the

Hr. Bobinson, you didn’t ask for

13

MR. R0BIHS0H:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. ROBINSON:

No, we did not.

Has there a reason for that?
He simply felt that under

16

Section 303 of the Act that’s where our remedy lie and

17

that we do not contend that the — or would submit that

18

the board has any authority to award damages to the

19

victim of a secondary boycott either — for any kinds of

20

business losses: that that claim should be and properly

21

be made in the 303 suit itself.

2

attorneys’ fees?
ME. ROBINSON:

4

No.

We are not contending that

5

a victim of a secondary boycott should have to have

6

superimposed upon itself an additional burden of proving

7

that the secondary boycott was in bad faith or that it

8

was obstinately motivated or things of that nature.

MR. ROBINSON:

— There are some elements in

this case of bad faith, but we are not making the

At the trial the union

13

stipulated that $13,604 was the amount that Summit

pertinent to note here.

other circuits which hold to the contrary.

However, the Court felt constrained to follow the

The rule prevailing in five of the six circuit
Courts of Appeals does allow a recovery of attorneys'

10

fees and expenses in this context because they're

11

incurred in a prior NLRB proceedings to obtain and

secure a cessation of the illegal activity and to

mitigate the continuing accrual of injuries caused by

14

those activities.

15

Now, we describe these expenses in a shorthand

Justice Rehnquist, the general

20

concept that we are talking about here, as expressed by

21

the prevailing rule of the circuits in 303 actions, has

22

had an historical application to a limited class of

23

cases arising under state common law such as false

arrest cases, malicious prosecution cases, indemnity

cases and like kinds of cases.

These cases are considered to be historically

2

consistent with the American rule, but at the same time

3

they have a limited application to cases where the

4 illegal activity creates a uniquely compelling need to
5 employ the attorneys, and where there's a direct
6

7
8

connection between the injury and the attorneys' fees.
In that connection, it's worthy to note, I
think, that the application of this Section 303 kind of

9 a rule has not found any application beyond it to the
10

injunction kinds of cases that you're talking about.

11

The numbers of cases decided by five of these circuit

12

Courts of Appeals, we cannot find any cases that apply

13 that in a nonlabor law context, and that may be —
14

QUESTION*

Well, why should it be peculiar to

15 labor law if it's in the context of this general rule in
16 America that you don't recover attorneys* fees as an
17 incident of your damages in the action itself?

Surely

18 there are torts outside the field of labor law that one
19 could argue are just as uniquely compelling, I think was
20

your language, as a secondary boycott.

MR. ROBINSON*

Well, are you limiting your

adoption by this Court is, of course, limited to the

unique circumstance of the federal labor law.

3

perhaps it is limited because we have I think here some

4

unique mechanisms which trigger cease and desist

5

remedies, and the nature of the conduct with which we're

6

dealing and the injury with which we're dealing, the

7

fact that it is inherently injurious — in fact, that's

it's only purpose is to cause injury, unlike other torts

know that historically for — going back to treatises in

18

the early part of this century, commentators have noted

19

that, yes, that in certain kinds of cases involving

20

maliciousness or involving intentional injury and where

21

the act is designed solely to injure, then perhaps this

22

kind of concept, considering attorneys' fees not qua

recognized.

13

And Congress did something unique when it —

14

in trying to foster and promote these two goals when it

in most circuits
This Court has viewed the considerations of

what remedies are available under Section 303 by

4

reference to the Act itself and consistent with its

policies and purposes.

6

cases both in Section 303 and 301 this Court has said

that even though common law or state law remedies such

as punitive damages are clearly available, those

remedies where over and above the make whole principle

Consequently, or

conversely, the common law principles from which the

make no demonstration or attempt to demonstrate how the

because the attorneys' fees that we're talking about

the employer if this rule is adopted.
However, we do find some common ground with
the AFL-CIO in its amicus brief when it notes that the

4 First Circuit's approach is persuasive.

The First

5

Circuit has closely attempted to distinguish between

6

attorney's fees incurred to obtain a cessation of

7

ongoing injury as distinguished from attorneys* fees

8

incurred to adjudicate liability after the fact.

And

9 that distinction we have not hesitated to embrace.
10

And since the AFL-CIO‘characterizes this

11

approach as persuasive, we believe that that distinction

12

accommodates both the Section 303 and the American rule

13 because it allows recovery when legal expenses flow
14 directly and foreseeably from ongoing wrong, but at the
15 same time recognizes that legal expenses incurred after
16 the injury has ceased are incurred as a result of the
17 litigant's decision to litigate and not as a result of
18 the need to obtain a cessation of the conduct.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGES:

9

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID S. PAULL, ESQ.,

10
11
12

13

Hr. Pauli.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MS. PAULLj

Mr. Chief Justice, and may *it

please the Court:
Let me begin by emphasizing that this case in

14

a truly fundamental sense is first and foremost a pure

15

matter of statutory construction.

The basic issue here

16 is what did Congress mean when it utilized the legal
17
18

term "damages” in the enactment of Section 303.
As this Court has stated so often, the

19

starting point in the construing of a statute must be

20

with the very language of the statute itself.

21

of course. Section 303 the operative language, the

22

language that we need to construe is that phrase

23

"damages by him sustained."

24
25

And in,

Now, the lessons learned from this Court
indicates that when Congress employs a term, a legal

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

term of art such as "damages," the use of that term

2

evokes an entire tradition of meaning as expressed by

3

the decisional law applicable to that term.

4

clear indications to the contrary, we know from the

5

cases of this Court that Congress intends for '•hat

6

language to be construed in the context of that

And absent

7 tradition.
8

How, Judge Browning of the Ninth Circuit Court

9 of Appeals demonstrated his understanding of that legal
10

tradition surrounding the term "damages" when he ruled

11

in Mead’s Market v. Retail Clerks that attorneys’ fees

12

incurred in a prior litigation may not be recovered in a

13

subsequent suit between the same parties; and

14 specifically in Mead’s market that a Section 303
15

plaintiff cannot recover his attorneys’ fees incurred in

16 prior related proceedings.
17

Judge Brown cited with approval the Illinois

18 case of Ritter v. Ritter which is directly on point and
19 which I think describes better than any other case the
20

legal tradition that we are looking for in attempting to

21

construe the term "damages."

22

Now, Ritter really made three main points.

23 First of all it said that the amount of cost, not the
24 damages flowing from the wrong but the amount of costs
25 in pursuing a suit and the nature of those costs are set

23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
Am VIRGINIA AVF

SW

WASHINGTON O P. 9HH9A (0n0\ KSA-93AR

1

by the legislature, in this particular case Congress.

2

It established that the wrongful acts or the alleged

3

wrongful acts of the defendant create no separate

4

liability, no independent tort for the responsibility of

5

attorneys' fees, unless, of course, the wrongful act

6

forced the plaintiff into litigation with some third

7

party, which of course is not the case here.

8
9

Finally, the Ritter court explained very well
the rationale which is behind the American rule, and

10

cited over 20 cases which was in accord with its view.

11

And as of 1943 whan the Ritter court made its decision

12

it had found no law, no law to the contrary; and one of

13

those cases it cited was that Flanders v. Tweed case, a

14

very old 1872 case which also involved attorneys' fees

15

for a prior proceeding.

16

And since it stated its rationale so clearly

17

and since that rationale is so important to this

18

argument, I would just briefly like to read from page 13

19

of the amicus brief where part of this is set forth.

20

"Under our jurisprudence the defendant may

21

present any defense to such an action that he may have

22

or that he may deem expedient, and in so doing he will

23

not be subjecting himself to a second suit by plaintiff

24

based on the wrongful conduct of the defendant in

25

causing the plaintaiff to sue him or in defending the

24

Ann VIRGINIA AVF

SW

WASHINGTON D O 9nn9A f9tt9\ SSA-9AAR

1

action.

2

conduct of the defendant is willful, intentional,

3

malicious or fraudulent."

The rule is the same even though the wrongful

4

How, of course, there are exceptions to that

5

rationale, and they are in fact the exceptions to the

6

rule.

7

involved, not the wrongful conduct, but when the defense

8

itself is in bad faith or vexatious, that is an

9

exception to the rule.

When the defense proffered not the conduct

The common benefit theory, which

10

we mention in our brief, and the collateral litigation

11

theory, these are exceptions to the rule.

12

rationale in every other case has been deemed to be

13

applicable, and it is submitted on the authorities

14

listed in our brief, and specifically in Ritter and

15

Head, that the ordinary, common meaning of the word

16

"damages" as it appeared to Congress in 1947 when the

17

legislation was enacted, the legal tradition which

18

Congress intended us to draw on when it employed the

19

term "damages" does not include attorneys* fees incurred

20

in a prior proceeding before or involving the National

21

Labor Relations Board in a case arising under Section

22

8(b)(4).

23
24
25

QUESTION*

But the

Hr. Pauli, I guess there are four

other circuits that disagree, however.
HR. PAULL*

That's true. Your Honor.

And of

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202} 554-2345

1

course I hasten to point out that this Court has often

2

ignored the majority of circuits, and especially in

3

Alyeska when the private attorneys general theory was

4

subscribed to by so many circuits and this Court

5

overruled the theory.

6

But I think the point is that we have to look

7

to the rationale provided by those cases and match it

8

against the rationale for the American rule.

9

theory offered really is that of the Eighth Circuit

The only

10

which says that the damages are like compensatory

11

damages in that they stop further harm and that they are

12

more like a business expense than attorneys* fees, and

13

that provides the basis for granting.

14

But there are all kinds of policy reasons

15

against that.

16

point out that first we must look to the statutory

17

language; and I don’t think that any of those courts

18

have done so.

19

which the petitioner now urges upon this Court.

long tradition of law that we have.

4

And I

We've examined the policy arguments made by

5

the petitioner with respect to his argument, and we have

6

met those arguments in our brief.

7

first of all, I think the policy arguments which he made

8

are easily met.

9

not attorneys* fees is part of Section 303.

We say only first —

All these objectives are met whether or

But our first position is and must be that

10
11

before this matter can be examined in the light of any

12

kind of national labor policy, this Court first must

13

determine whether or not the guestion is even open or

14

even lends itself to such an analysis.

15

firm viewpoint that in view of the language of the

16

statute and the legislative history and the rules of

17

statutory construction that the question of federal

18

labor policy as it relates to petitioner's claim is just

19

clearly foreclosed as a method of resolving this case.

And it is our

20

And I think to some degree the petitioner

21

would want this Court to place labor law on another

22

planet than earth, and I don't think that that can be

23

done.

24

construction must be observed and that the rationale

25

which underlies the American rule is important enough to

I think that these rules of statutory

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 12021 554-2345

1

2

be preserved in all cases.
And in two of this Court's recent cases the

3

Court has forced the very legal tradition of which I was

4

speaking surrounding the term of "damages," and I'm

5

speaking now of F.D. Rich and Fleishman which is cited

6

in our briefs.

7

In F.D. Rich and Fleishman this Court

8

emphasized that the make whole argument, which is really

9

the argument the petitioner is making, when grounded on

10

policy of something else other than the express

11

statutory language must yield to the countervailing

12

considerations that are set forth in F.D. Rich and also

13

referred to in Ritter.

14

Both the Eight Circuit and the petitioner take

15

the position that attorneys' fees in obtaining a

16

cessation of picketing are analogous to these elements

17

of compensatory damages and therefore recoverable.

18

And this I think. Justice O'Connor,

19

specifically answers — more specifically answers your

20

question — but first of all, that this argument is

21

specifically rejected in Rich and Fleishman which teach

22

that of the two considerations, the rationale for the

23

American rule must win out, except, of course, when

24

Congress expressly states otherwise.

25

intended attorneys' fees to be covered for a certain

And when it has

1

situation, it has in the past had no difficulty in

2

phrasing that in its statutes.
QUESTION;

3

Mr. Pauli, if the American rule is

4

that strict, do you think there’s some problem with the

5

board's authority to award attorneys’ fee under the

6

Tiidee doctrine?
MS. PAULL*

7

I think there may be.

I think

8

there may well be a problem under those circumstances.

9

Of course, that’s not involved in this case.
I think the rationale for the rule, the

10
11

protection of the right of the plaintiff to sue without

12

incurring attorney’s fees from the other side, the

13

protection of the defendant’s right to assert a defense

14

without incurring attorneys’ fees on the other side, I

15

don’t know, of course, but I feel that that may present

16

a problem.

17

I think the facts of Fleishman are

18

particularly compelling in this instance.

Petitioner

19

seeks to distinguish Fleishman because the fees sought

20

in that case were at a prior stage of the same

21

proceeding.

22

irresistable analogy between the injunctive proceeding

23

in Fleishman and the 10L type of proceeding which we

24

have in this case in the ULP proceeding, the unfair

25

labor practice proceeding.

First of all, I think there is an

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

It's especially true in this case when the UIP

2

decision, the unfair labor practice decision, was used

3

as collaterally estopping the issue of liability in the

4

Section 303 action.

5

closer relationship between the two proceedings?

6

What could be indicative of a

Certainly if the union had prevailed in the

7

unfair labor practice, which it certainly could have, or

8

in the injunction proceeding, it could not under any

9

theory, under any stretch of the imagination recovered

10

its attorneys’ fees against the employer.

11

particularly pernicious in this instance, I think., to

12

allow such an item of damage to the employer under these

13

circumstances.

14

It would be

Petitioner seeks to distinguish Fleishman and

15

the rational of the American rule on the grounds that

16

the union’s conduct was deliberate, that it was

17

extrajudicial; it did not invoke the court process.

18

This cannot affect the applicability of the rationale of

19

the American rule.

20

after all is not decided until after a case is

21

determined, not beforehand.

22

the plaintiff’s right to sue in any given case would be

23

elevated or be superior to the defendant’s right to

24

assert a defense, which just isn’t the American rule,

25

unless, of coarse, that defense is in bad faith.

The question of wrongful conduct

And if that would be true,

But

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (2021 554-2345

1

there is certainly a well-established exception for that.
QUESTION:

2

Hell, I'm not sure I follow your

3

track there, why this affects the plaintiff, as you put

4

it.

5

MR. PAULL:

6

QUESTION:

Hell -I

should think— perhapsI'm just

7

misconstruing what you

said — thatif we were trying to

8

move toward the English rule — I'mnot suggesting we

9

what the Court's going

—

to do — butif we were trying to

10

move toward the English rule and away from the old

11

American rule, we'd say that putting costs on — more

12

costs on the plaintiff who loses, if he loses, will tend

13

to discourage irresponsible litigation.

14
15
16

Hould you agree with that as a general
proposition?
MR. PAULL*

Yes.

Of course that's true.

But

17

what I'm saying in this case, if you reverse the

18

American rule, I imagine it would certainly apply to the

19

plaintiffs, too.

20

QUESTION:

And on the contrary, when a

21

plaintiff brings a suit and is vindicated in his right,

22

the English rule would suggest that he isn’t made whole

23

unless he gets his legal expenses back.

24
25

MR. PAULL*

Yes, that's true.

So I guess in

that sense it doesn't — it doesn't — the two rights

31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

aren’t elevated as long as they were treated equally

2

because — as long as the attorneys' fees were given to

3

the prevailing party, but that would have to be done.

4

I guess my basic point is that the defendants

5

in this case had a right to assert a defense.

The

6

defense, that they are picketing, their wrongful

7

activity, as it turned out to be wrongful, was for a

8

lawful object, for a lawful work preservation clause,

9

and not for an object which violates 8(b)(4).

And under

10

the rule it had every right to assert that, and I think

11

really that this is what the American rule is all about*

12

Finally, the petitioner claims that the

13

American rule has no application to those attorneys'

14

fees which he deems truly compensatory.

15

exactly sure what this means except — if it means what

16

I think it does, this type of an analysis would totally

17

swallow the American rule.

18

And I’m not

I think petitioner is trying to make a

19

distinction here between attorneys’ fees in the action

20

itself on hand and attorneys' fees in some preliminary

21

prior action, saying that attorneys’ fees incurred in

22

the preliminary actions to stop the wrongful conduct is

23

truly compensatory and that attorneys’ fees incurred in

24

the later action would be those covered by statute.

25

And what I need to say to that is that the

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

distinction cannot rest on that type of a theory.

There

2

would be nothing left of the rule.

3

for the American rule to apply in prior proceedings,

4

prior related proceedings between the two parties, as it

5

is in the main action itself, because in those prior

6

proceedings it’s as important to assert those defenses

7

or to promote the assertion of those defenses as it is

8

in any other action.

9

regardless of the stage of the litigation.

It's as important

And the right to defend is chilled
I think, in

10

the final analysis it’s not the stage of the litigation

11

that can determine whether or not attorneys' fees are

12

truly compensatory.

In the final analysis it must be

3

what Congress said it should be, what Congress said it

4

should be in terms of being truly compensatory.

5

We believe that Congress has made such a

6

statement here when it employed the use of the term

7

"damages" in its ordinary and common meaning in the

8

enactment of Section 303.

9

Thank you.

23

Very well.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD C. ROBINSON, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER -- Rebuttal

24

MR. ROBINSON:

Very briefly.

25

If the rule that we urge for adoption here and

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

which has been followed by five of the circuits for 21

2

years would swallow the American rule, I think we would

3

see substantial evidence of that in the case law in the

4

federal and state courts using these 303 actions to

5

invite distinctions and further exception to the

6

American rule.

7

I think the courts have properly recognized

8

that it is not an exception to the American rule at all

9

and that it does not offend the American rule; but the

10

American rule simply doesn't come into play because

11

we're talking about attorneys' fees as damages, not as

12

attorneys' fees.

13

The rationale of the American rule which the

14

respondent union argues so heavily should be applied to

15

this context, as Hr. Chief Justice Burger has indicated,

16

the rationale most often stated and stated by this Court

17

in Alyeska and other decisions is that it would chill

18

the accessibility of poor individuals, chill the

19

accessibility to bring otherwise meritorious claims to

20

court, and that's the rationale for the rule.

21

But I would offer that here it was the victim

22

of the activity that needed to have its ability to have

23

accessibility to the courts enhanced and encouraged.

24

And indeed, it was the respondent union against whom

25

these damages are to be assessed and should be assessed

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE.. S.W.. WASHINGTON. D C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

that resorted to conduct extrajudicial and clearly

2

demonstrated its rejection of the legal process.

3

The union in its argument this morning again

4

invites this Court, as it does in its brief, to avoid an

5

analysis of the purposes and goals of the federal labor

6

law.

7

in our briefs, to Hall v. Cole where the Court said that

8

in vindication of a federal — important federal labor

9

law rights this Court must look to the policies and

We would invite this Court's attention, as we did

10

purposes of the Act, and did allow a union member to

11

obtain his attorneys' fees, not in the limited context

12

that we're talking about but all of his attorneys' fees,

13

to vindicate his rights under the Act.

14

QUESTION*

Wasn’t that a common fund?

15

MR. ROBINSON*

16

QUESTION*

That was —

He had succeeded in obtaining an

17

award of damages or a monetary award of some sort for

18

the benefit of the union, and he was entitled to take

his fees out of that award.
MR. ROBINSON*

That's true. Justice

Rehnquist.

That was the ultimate rationale.

Hall v. Cole urged this Court to follow the rational of

The union acknowledges to this Court in

3

response to the question that the board's authority

9

10

fees is questionable, but yet wants and urges this Court

20

incurred as a result of the illegal activity.
