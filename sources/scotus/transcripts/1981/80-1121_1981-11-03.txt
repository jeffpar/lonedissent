ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ,

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. HOROWITZ:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

8 may it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of
9 certiorari to the United States Court of Claims.

It

10 involves two different pay systems for federal employees,
11 the prevailing rate system, or WS system, which essentially
12 covers blue collar workers, and the General Schedule or GS
13 system which covers white collar workers.
14

Each pay system contains different grade levels

15 and different steps within each grade.

The steps are

16 different gradations of pay within the grade.
17

The Respondents here are six employees of the

18 Department of the Navy or their representatives who left WS
19 blue collar jobs to accept white collar jobs covered by the
20 General Schedule.

After an administrative error that had

21 given five of these employees a one-step pay increase, after
22 that error was corrected, their starting salaries in their
23 new GS jobs were correctly established under regulations
24 promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management, issued
25 pursuant to 5 USC 5334(a), according to the so-called

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 highest previous rate rule, which places the employee at the
2 nearest step above his old salary.
3

QUESTION;

4 about one thing.

Mr. Horowitz, I want to be certain

Does the government concede that the

5 transfer here effected a promotion of these employees?
6

MR. HOROWITZ;

7 term of art in some ways.

Well, promotion has been used as a
There was a promotion under the

8 regulations under the Office of Personnel Management,
9 because such promotion is defined in terms of whether the
10 employee receives an increase in pay when his new salary is
11 established, and that in fact occurred here.
12

As to whether they were promotions in sort of the

13 layman’s sense to a position of higher responsibility, that
14 really hasn't been developed that much in the record, but
15 there is no reason for this Court to assume that they were
16 not.
17

QUESTION;

That they were not.

18

MR. HOROWITZ;

But in our view that makes no

19 difference for purposes of the statute.
20

QUESTION;

The Court of Claims did go that far so

21 to describe it, anyway.
22

MR. HOROWITZ;

Yes, although the Court of Claims

23 primarily relied on this regulation, 5 CFR 531.202.
24

Now, the guestion here is whether the 0PM

25 regulations that were invoked in this case are contrary to

4

1 law
2

QUESTIONi

Mr. Horowitz, let me just be sure I

3 understand your answer to Justice Blackmun.

In the Court of

4 Claims, the opinion states that both parties had termed the
5 actions promotions.
6

MR. HOROWITZ;

7

QUESTION;

Right.

Have you changed your position?

You

8 say it is arguable now whether it was a promotion.
9

MR. HOROWITZ;

No, we don't contend that -- they

10 are certainly classified as promotions by the Navy, and that
11 is because of this regulation, which depends on whether they
12 receive a salary increase.

They are certainly promotions

13 within the meaning of the regulation.

And as to whether

14 they are promotions in a more common sense matter, I don't
15 think that has really been determined, but we don’t contest
16 that they are.
17

We have never argued that they are not.

QUESTION;

18 meaning of 5334(A)
19

But are they then promotions within the
and (B)?

MR. HOROWITZ:

Yes, they can be.

5334(a) and (b)

20 also refer to transfers in there, so -21

QUESTION;

Well, if that is the case, and I must

22 concede that for a court of supposedly nine generalists,
23 this is a very difficult case, because of the very technical
24 civil service and 0PM regulations, didn't the Court of
25 Claims in effect declare invalid one of the regulations

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 promulgated by the GPK?
2

MF. HOROWITZ*

That's correct.

There was a

3 regulation promulgated by OPM that restricts the
4 applicability of this Section 5334(b) to promotions within
5 the GS system, from one GS position to another, and the
6 Court of Claims declared that that regulation was
7 inconsistent with the language of the statute, and that
8 regulation was declared invalid to that extent.
9

QUESTION*

So it gave no deference to the

10 regulatory authority.
11

MR. HOROWITZ*

That's correct.

Perhaps I should

12 read Section 5334(b), which is the focus of the dispute
13 here.

"An employee who is promoted or transferred to a

14 position in a higher grade is entitled to basic pay at the
15 lowest rate of the higher grade which exceeds his existing
16 rate of basic pay by not less than two step increases of the
17 grade from which he is promoted or transferred."
18

In other words, when an employee is subject to

19 this section, you look at his old salary, give him what is
20 called a two-step increase in his old salary, and then
21 transfer that into his new grade and pick the salary that is
22 closest to that an d higher.
23

Now, the question here i s simply whether this

24 statutory two-step increase applies when an employee moves
25 from the WS system to a position in the GS system, as

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 occurred here, and as the Court of Claims held, or whether
2 the statute applies only to promotions from one GS grade to
3 another, as the government contends.
4

In our view, this question is unequivocally

5 answered by the language of the statute.

Under 5 USC

6 5102(a)(5), a definitional section, the term "grade" in
7 Section

5334(b) is defined as a class of positions included,

8 and I quote, "within one range of rates of basic pay in the
9 General Schedule", end quote.
10

Section 5334(b) provides that the increase in

11 salary is to be measured as no less than two step increases
12 of the grade from which the employee is promoted or
13 transferred.

Because Respondents were not promoted or

14 transferred from a grade as defined in the statute, that is
15 to say, a grade in the GS system, they do not come within
16 the language of Section 5334(b).
17
18 there?

QUESTION*

Mr. Horowitz, can I stop you right

I guess the key to it is right in what you are

19 saying now.

The definition of grade doesn't purport to be

I

20 exclusive.

It says it includes those in the GS schedule,

21 and you earlier told us, as I understand you, that there are
22 grades in the NS schedule as well.
23 clear that the word

Now, is it perfectly

"grade" could not apply to a grade in

24 the blue collar schedule?
25

MR. HOROWITZ*

Well, I agree that the statute says

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 includes, but I think the o nly r easonable reading of that is
2 that that is the definition
3

QUESTION;

•

Well, have you not also admitted, or

4 maybe I am wrong, that if t here had been a promotion within
5 the WS schedule, you would have been entitled to have the
6 benefit of the statute»
7

MR. HOROWITZ.*

8

QUESTION;

No .

The statute --

The Co urt of Claims said that, but that

9 is wrong?
10

Ri ght.

MR. HOROWITZ;

11 that, but that is wrong.

The Court of Claims said

A statute clearly cannot apply to

12 a promotion within the WS s ystem, because b lue collar
13 workers are completely excl uded from Subcha pter 3, which
14 contains the statute.

This Section 5334(b)

applies only to

15 the GS system.
16

Now, the basis th at these Respond ents have for

17 arguing that it applies to them is that now that they have
18 moved into the GS s ystem, they are technica lly GS workers,
19 and it is their new salary, but any salary in the WS system
20 would not be set pu rsuant to this provision

23 back to your questi on, th er e a re g ra des in the WS system,
24 although as we poin ted ou t in ou r re ply bri ef,

I think,

the

1 context until 1972, 23 years after this statute was enacted.
2

QUESTION*

Is it clear that the "General Schedule”

3 referred to in 5102(a)(5) does not include the WS separate
4 sched ule ?
5

KB. HOROWITZ;

That's correct.

Those employees

6 are specifically included -- excluded, rather, from the
7 General Schedule.

Again, as I said, Justice Stevens, these

8 employees are now in the General Schedule because of their
9 new position .
10

Now, in order to understand the reasoning, I

11 think, behind the restriction of a two step increase to the
12 context of promotions within the GS system, I think it might
13 be helpful to digress into a slightly more detailed
14 discussion of these two pay systems and their differences.
15

The General Schedule is described in Subchapter 3

16 of Chapter 53 in the civil service statute, and as it exists
17 today, it is derived largely from the Classification Act of
18 1949, and it was at that time, in 1949, when Section 5334(b)
19 was first enacted, although it originally provided for only
20 one step increase.
21

The GS system is divided into 18 different grades,

22 most of which are divided -- further subdivided into ten
23 steps.

Now, there is an overlap between steps in the GS
That is, while any higher grade, the same step in

25 any two grades, the higher grade will be a higher salary,

1 for example a Grade

14 Step 1 salary will be higher than a

2 Grade 13 Step 1 salary, at the higher steps of a particular
3 grade, the salary can be higher than a lower step of a
4 higher grade, or to give an example, again, a 13 Step 6
5 employee would be making a higher salary than a 14 Step 1
6 employee .
7

There are two ways in which employees can move to

8 different classifications in the system.
9 can be given step increases.

First of all, they

The statute defines the

10 waiting period for which an employee must wait to get a step
11 increase.

That is between one to three years, depending on

12 the level he is at, but once he satisifes that waiting
13 period, he is given a step increase as long as he has
14 performed satisfactorily in his job.
15

Getting a step increase does not mean any increase

16 in responsibility or level of difficulty.
17

QUESTION:

— for the problems?
I don't think so .

Counsel, can you tell me , please,

23 whether the provisions for grading within the WS system were
24 in effect at the time that the General Schedule statute,
25 Section 5334 was originally adopted?

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1

MR. HOROWITZ:

Well, in 1949, the only reference

2 to the -- in that 1949 Act to the WS system was a
3 one-sentence exclusion exluding blue collar workers from the
4 operation of the statute, and stating that their salaries
5 are to be determined according to prevailing rates in the
6 industry.
7

Wow, that was done administratively by each

8 individual agency.

Each agency ran its own WS system, so to

9 speak, conducted its own wage surveys, and determined what
10 the proper salary for a particular position was.
11 of this was something of a hodge-podge.
12 it,

The result

But as I understand

most of the agencies did have a system that included

13 something called grades.

The number of grades varied from

14 agency to agency, and a particular job would vary.
15

They did not all have steps in the sense that

16 there is now in the statute.
17 within a grade.
18

Some of them had three steps

Some just had grades without steps at all.

The other way that a person can move in the GS

19 system is by getting a promotion to a job that entails more
20 responsibility, and in this case he would move up to a
21 higher grade.

Now,

the operation of Section 5334(b) comes

22 into effect when an employee is promoted from a high step at
23 one grade to the next grade.
24

For example, if an employee were promoted from a

25 Step — a Grade 13 Step 5 position, if he were simply

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

2 he would actually get a decrease in salary.

14 Step 1,

So, under

3 Section 5334(b), what is done is, you give him a two step
4 increase.

That is, he was a 13 Step 5,

5 the dollar figure would be for a

6 figure is then plugged into the GS 14 levels,

and he is

In this example, he would

14, Step 2.
Now, the Wage System, although it parallels the GS

10 system to some degrees, is quite different.

As it exists

11 now, it is set out in Subchapter u of Chapter 53.

These are

12 amendments that were enacted substantially in 1972.

The

13 main difference between the two systems is that the WS
14 system is based on prevailing rates in the industry, and
15 varies widely over geographic areas.
16

An employee performing the same job in Columbus,

17 Georgia, will be making a much lower salary than an employee
18 who is performing the same job in Detroit, Michigan.

GS

19 salaries are uniform nationwide.
20

Now, as I mentioned before, at the time the

21 Classification Act was first enacted, there was no
22 coordinated WS system.

Each agency ran its own system, and

23 the mechanics of each system varied.
24 steps.

Some grades did not.

Some grades had

In the late 1960s, it was

25 decided that the system should be coordinated, and pursuant

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 to a directive by President Johnson, the agencies got
2 together and developed a coordinated Wage System that
3 extended uniformly throughout all the agencies.

Again, this

4 system is not uniform throughout the United States.

There

5 are geographical differences.
6

In

1972,

the coordinated system was enacted into

7 the statute, with certain changes.

One of the changes is

8 that the original coordinated system had only three steps
9 per grade, and now the statute provides for five steps per
10 grade.
11

One oth
other
er difference between the WS system and the

12 GS system is that tthe
waiting periods for step increases in
h
13 the Wage System
ystem aare
re significantly shorter.

Thus, while it

14 would take an employ
employee who starts at a GS Step 1

18 years to

15 become a GSS Step 10, in the Wage System it would take only
16 six years to move f
from
r
the lowest step to the highest step.
17

Now,

I thi
think it is the recent development of this

18 formal WS system and
19 to the GS system tha
20 the Eespon dent's con
21 that could hardly ha

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

To repeat what I said earlier, this contention

2 could not possibly be squared with the express terms of the
3 statute.

Section 5334(b) specifies that the salary increase

4 be computed based on the employee's steps in his old grade,
5 and "grade" is defined -- and this definition is expressly
6 incorporated into Subchapter 3, the GS section -- "grade" is
7 defined as a rate of pay in the General Schedule.

The

8 Respondents do not have an old grade in this sense on which
9 the salary can be based.

They are newcomers to the GS

10 system, and the statute by its terms can only be applied to
11 GS veterans, people who are both promoted from and promoted
12 to a GS position.

The only way around this is to rewrite

13 the statute.
14

Now, it is no accident that the statute has this

15 limitation on the two st ep increase provision.

The purposes

16 of the two step increase are directly relevant to this
17 context of promotions wi thin the GS system.

Because of the

18 overlap between grades, it is a common problem in promotions
19 within the GS system tha t an employee would not receive a
20 salary increase without the two step increase provision,
21

QUESTION;

Whe n you say the overlap between

22 grades, you refer back t o the fact that a GS 13, Step 10,
23 might be receiving more salary than a GS 14, Step 1?
24

MR. HOROWITZ;

Right.

That's correct.

Now, the

25 reason that Congress was concerned about this is that in

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

would be better without the two step increase

for his own salary reasons, to stay in his

xiany of the jobs are simply not

As I said, in this case, we have not contended,

has not really been litigated whether there was an

25 increase in

responsibility here, but as far as Congress's

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 intent in passing the statute, there was no need for them to
2 provide an automatic two-step increase.
3

Similarly, looking at the 1949 statute, there is

4 no reason to believe that Congress intended to cover WS
5 employees.

Back in 1949, Congress was not focusing at all

6 on the WS system.

It merely excluded them from the

7 provisions of the Classification Ret.

Moreover, because the

8 two step increase depends on the steps in the employee's
9 prior grade, it would have made no sense to apply it to
10
11

employees coming from the WS system.
As I said, the WS system at that time was

12 something of a hodge-podge.

Many of the grades did not have

13

steps at all, and if Congress had applied this provision to

14

the WS system, it really would not have known what sort of

15

increases it was guaranteeing to the employees.

16

Even as the system has been refined today, it

17

still makes little sense for this provision to apply to

18

promotions from the WS system.

19

illustration of how Respondent's contention diverges from

I think the best

20 Congressional intent is to notice that the steps, the
21

gradations within the grades in the WS system are larger

22

than the gradations within the GS system.

23

the steps in the WS system at 4 percent increases, so

24

therefore the Respondents are actually asking for a greater

25

benefit here than would be given to persons who are promoted

The statute sets

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 within the GS system, which is what the statute was directly
2 aimed at.
3

Now, the Court of Claims decision rests simply on

4 its placing undue influence on the one word "promotion" in
5 the statute, but there are several difficulties with the
6 Court’s analysis.

First and most obvious, of course, is

7 that it omits to read the rest of the statute.
8

More importantly,

the Court of Claims itself

9 conceded that promotions are also covered by Section
10 5334(a), the general provision that permits 0PM to set the
11 basic rates of pay for employees who move from one job to
12 another.

Therefore, the mere fact, the mere

13 characterization of a personnel action as a promotion cannot
14 in and of itself determine whether it is properly considered
15 under 5334(a) or 5334(b).
16

I would like to turn away from the language of the

17 statute now to discuss the consistent administrative
18 construction here, which we think is also dispositive of the
19 issue.
20

In this case, 0PM and its predecessor, the Civil

21 Service Commission, has consistently adhered to the position
22 that Section 5334(b) applies only to promotions within the
23 GS system.

The regulation was first published in 1950, only

24 one year after the statute was enacted, and it has not been
25 altered since.

Congress has apparently --

MR. HOROWITZ*

Now, the reason that the language

employees in the General Schedule is that in 1949 and for

13 a short

period thereafter, the Classification Act actually

14 set up two schedules.

There was a separate schedule called

16 also applied to employees in that schedule by the terms of

In 1954, Congress decided that there was no need

Schedule positions.

So, today, to talk

24 that would not exactly

have been accurate.

I am not sure if

25 that was clear.

No, when was - - yes, the one that you

11 guoted.
12

MR. HOROWITZ*

I think this exact language perhaps

13 dates back to 1965.

I am not sure if there have been minor

14 chang es since then.

I think it goes back n o earl ier than

15 1965, but the thrust of the regulation has never changed .
16

QUESTION;

May I ask one more gue stion about the

17 regulation in its pre-1965 form?

Did you tell me that at

18 that time the Classification Act included both the General
19 Schedule people and a special kind of craft people?

What

20 were the craft people who were covered?
21

MR . HOROWITZ*

Well, they were -- they are all

22 people who are now covered by t he General Schedule.

The

23 are not these blue collar worke rs who are covered by the
24 system.

They were janitors.

It was called the crafts

25 protection custodial schedule.

So I think custodial

19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 workers, guards in federal buildings, and the craft workers,
2 I think, were mechanics who repaired things in federal
3 buildings, things like that.
4

QUESTION;

And all of that category is now part of

5 the GS schedule, and none of it is in the WS schedule?
6

MR. HOROWITZ;

Right.

In 1954 all those positions

7 were converted to GS positions.
8

I think it is particularly significant that

9 Congress made no effort to change the system in 1972, when
10 it focused on the WS employees and enacted special
11 provisions for WS employees.

In particular, in 1972,

12 Congress gave WS employees some benefits that had earlier
13 been given to GS employees, such as the retained basic pay
14 provision, which is discussed in our reply brief.

Yet it

15 did not enact any provision providing for an automatic
16 increase, both -- either from WS to GS positions or even for
17 promotions within the WS system.
18

Moreover, to the extent that there is any

19 ambiguity in Section 5334(b), this seems to be a classic
20 case of deferring to the agency’s interpretation.

It is a

21 specialized area where the agency has developed a particular
22 expertise.

The regulations are contemporaneous with the

23 enactment of the statute, and are long-standing and
24 consistent.

Indeed, the Classification Act of 1949 was

25 based on bills that were submitted by the agency involved

1 here, the Civil Service Commission, and the legislative
2 history reflects the Commission's view that this section was
3 in accord with its views.
4

It is hard to imagine a more well established

5 interpretation.

It has never seriously been challenged for

6 30 years, and indeed, even in this litigation, the
7 Respondents did not allege that the two step increase
8 applied to them until some time after their petition in the
9 Court of Claims was filed, because if you examine the
10 petition that is reprinted in the appendix, you will see
11 that they at that time asked only for the one step increases
12 that had mistakenly been given to them by the agency.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

19 the Court, Respondents do in fact focus upon the plain
20 language of the statute, and we contend that there is in
21 fact no ambiguity whatsoever, that in point of fact
22 employees promoted to a higher grade are entitled to the pay
23 implementation provisions of 5334(b), and so the Court of
24 Claims has found.
25

We suggest that we can focus upon the fact that

That was the event.

Now,

8 the Wage System has grades and had grades and had grades way
9 back to immediately post-World War Two period, just as the
10 General Schedule had grades and has had grades for an
11 extensive period of time.
12

In like fashion, the Wage System has steps, and we

13 point out in our briefing and the Court below appropriately
14 found that each of these Respondents was in fact promoted
15 from one position to a higher position.

This was conceded

16 below, and the mechanics of going beneath or behind the
17 personnel action of promotion was never raised, nor does the
18 administrative record support any position that it could
19 have been raised, because these were in fact promotions.

QUESTION:

Mr. Heise -Yes, sir.

10 hypothetical question that has troubled me?

As I understand

11 it, under the Wage System you can have different rates in
12 different parts of the country, and supposing in one part of
13 the country there was a very low salary scale and in other
14 parts very high, and the same position in those two parts of
15 the country were both transferred into the GS system.

For

16 one it meant a reduction in salary; for the other it meant
17 an increase.
18

Would they both be promotions?

MR. HEISE:

No, they would not be, because the

19 concept that you are referring to, Your Honor, has to do
20 with not being selected as a result of a competitive program
21 or not being selected because of -22

and another employee is a GS 11, Step 5, and

QUESTION;

Well, Mr. Heise, do you disagree with

11 the statement in the government's reply brief on Page

in

12 the last sentence of the first paragraph where they say,
13 when employees are "promoted" to the GS system from lower
14 paying positions in the wholly separate WS system, there is
15 no comparable inherent increase in responsibility?
16

MR. HEISEi

I disagree emphatically on the terms

17 of the case which is here, and under the normal parlance of
18 defining why the employee would be promoted, because, in
19 point of fact, the positions here, they were promoted to
20 positions of greater responsibility and duty, and this is
21 the parlance of promotion.

If in point of fact they were

22 moving all the ship surveyors as a class or the position of
23 ship surveyor into the General Schedule, a movement, that
24 might be a conversion, but that would not be a promotion,
25 and you must understand or we must understand in examining

2 group and promotion or transfer to a higher grade as an

7 of fact they are different types of actions.

17 5 CFR 531.202(h)(2), and that, and the Court of Claims

Well, most of the definitions talk

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

9

When you move from a

to a GS system grade by a promotion, your

7 duties are more complex,

as they were here.

And this is the

the case, the more complex duties.

Wow, to focus on any particular definition either
the regulations or in the statute which so defines, the

11 answer is,

I cannot per se, however, because most of the

12 regulatory concepts deal with what

4 criteria,

10 in

point of fact,

happens after the

has said you are better qualified.

QUESTION;

And 5 USC 5102(a)(5),

which I take it

the basic statute, simply says that when your

16 responsibility
17 talk

increases, you get more money.

It doesn't

about promotions.

18

HR. HEISE;

Well, but in the legislative intent

19 which we have recited

20 also made reference
21 promotion in

22 a promotion
23 should

in our brief in the Court of Claims,

to back in

1949, Congress said a

pay, and the committee report, should accompany
of duties, and that is the basic concept.

You

get more money.

24

QUESTION;

25

HR. HEISE:

Well, an increase in pay, didn't it?
I think they used promotion, an

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 increase in pay or a promotion in pay, more pay for increase
2 in duties, and that is the concept that is built into this
3 particular statute.
4

Now, if we test the government’s case of

5 limitation, we feel that it is conclusive that the statute
6 itself on its face certainly doesn't limit these promotions
7 to only within the General Schedule.

As we pointed out, the

8 legislative intent was clear that an increase in pay should
9 accompany a promotion in duty.

Under the government's

10 theory in the case, their application of this highest
11 previous rate rule, which is an administrative regulation,
12 you could be promoted under the government's theory and
13 receive no increase in pay whatsoever, because if you
14 annualized, if you would, the Wage System salary and then
15 matched it over under their theory to the General Schedule
16 salary, if they matched exactly, you would get no increase,
17 and in their brief,

they even indicate -- the government

18 even indicates that under their theory a person could
19 receive less salary, and certainly Congress never intended
20 that in any stretch of the imagination, and that is what the
21 Court of Claims relied upon, that an increase, a promotion,
22 having been selected for promotion, it necessarily follows
23 that you should receive more pay.
24

QUESTION;

Do you agree that the Court of Claims

25 struck down a regulation?

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

MR. HEISEi

We do.

The Court found it

2 inconsistent with the statute.

If there is any question

3 about how this movement back and forth has developed, we
4 suggest that the Court can example the Proto case, which we
5 have cited -- I believe it is at Footnote 12 on Page 13 of
6 our brief.

Mr. Proto was one of the Respondents in this

7 case.
8

In 1968, he, as a Wage System employee, was

9 promoted to General Schedule.

Then he was changed back to

10 lower grade pursuant to a reduction in force, and at that
11 time they called it a change to lower grade.

He moved from

12 a higher grade position in the General Schedule back to the
13 lower grade Wage System position, and the courts -- I mean,
14 and the agency, its own personnel officials, so described it.
15

Then, later on, he moved back up again, and then

16 he was demoted back, and finally the action which is before
17 the Court now, part of it 1973, he was promoted again.

So,

18 long before 1972, the agency itself, this very agency was
19 using the grade concept to apply Wage System -- to apply to
20 Wage System employees.
21

Now, the point here is that the discretion isn’t

22 in the paying.
23 official.

The discretion occurs in the selecting

The personnel official and the operating

24 officials who call it a promotion then set up the criteria
25 for the employee to be paid, and this necessarily follows.

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

Now, the point has been made that the

1972

2 legislation impliedly in some way gave rise to an approval
3 of the regulations which the Civil Service Commission had
4 promulgated, and this just isn't so, because if we contrast
5 it with the

1954 legislation, which has been called to the

6 Court's attention,

involving the movement of these crafts,

7 protective, and custodial employees into the General
8 Schedule, Congress at that time specifically stated that
9 they would not be involved or would not be construed, or
10 these actions, I should say, this conversion, Congress said
11 specifically shall not be construed to be transfers or
12 promotions within the meaning of 802, which is the
13 predecessor to 5334(b)
14

of the Classification het.

So, Congress, if they meant that here, in the case

15 of the Wage System employees, could have said the same
16 thing, but because they didn't,

the obvious intent of

17 Congress, we submit, was in point of fact to include them,
18 and so the Court of Claims found.
19

Now,

the point has been made that the Civil

20 Service Commission representative, in making his remarks to
21 the Congress, pointed out that this particular
22 legislation involved the General Schedule,

1949

but we contend

23 that this is not controlling because the Congress in its
24 committee report said nothing of the sort.

In point of

25 fact, if Congress had intended to exclude this schedule of

34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 employees from any of the language of 5334(b), it has had
2 ample opportunity to say so, over a period of time.
3

The 1972 legislation itself dealt with

4 nationalizing, if you would, codifying what had previously
5 been under executive order and previously under
6 administrative rule, a national system of wage board or Wage
7 System employees, so that there would be uniformity in
8 grades, or I should say uniformity in step and uniformity in
9 concept.

Not uniformity in rate, because the rate depends

10 on the particular area.

But that particular 1972

11 legislation did not in any way, shape, or form address
12 itself to the issue which we have before the Court here,
13 namely, promotions, or namely, the transfer to a higher
14 grade.
15

We feel that in examining the 1950 regulation

16 which has been relied upon by the government in its brief,
17 we at Page -- Footnote 20 of Page 23 of our brief did point
18 out how this particular regulation has vacillated back and
19 forth to recite repromotions, to talk about promotions, and
20 talk about a number of things.

Our position, of course, is

21 that there has been an inconsistency in application of this
22 -- of the statute by the agency below, and the inconsistency
23 was highlighted in this very case, because in one instance
24 they applied what they called the highest previous rate
25 rule, and in another instance they applied 5334(b) in

35

1 essence, and Respondent Libretto, who was the Respondent
2 below that gave rise to the case which finally arose in the
3 Court of Claims, because he said to the agency, I should be
4 getting the benefits of 5334(b), he at all times claimed
5 that he was entitled to the two step increase which the
6 statute provides.
7

So, our position in sum is that the Court of

8 Claims was in fact correct in its analysis of the
9 application of the statute, that the Civil Service
10 regulation, the Office of Personnel Management regulation
11 now, is contrary to the intent of Congress, and we submit
12 that the judgment of the Court of Claims should be
13 affirmed .
14

Thank you.

ORAL STATEMENT OF ALAN I. HOROWITZ, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. HOROWITZ:

A couple of points, Mr. Chief

20 Justice.
21

I think a critical point here is that there is

22 just no way to decide what a promotion is under the
23 Respondent's contention.

To get back to Mr. Justice

24 Stevens' question, promotions in the regulations are defined
25 only in terms of salary levels, and comparisons between

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

1 grades in the WS system and grades in the GS system are also
2 only in

terms of salary level.

3

Thus, in Mr. Justice Stevens' hypothetical, where

4 an employee moved from the same job in Georgia or in Alaska,
5 where in one case he was getting a pay increase and in one
6 case he was getting a pay decrease, it is clear under the
7 regulations that one of those would be characterized as
8 promotion and one would be characterized as a demotion, and
9 the relevant regulation here is 5 CFF 536.201.
10

So, the only way, really, to deal with

11 Respondent's contention is to take a common sense view of
12 the word "promotion",

to look at whether the employee has

13 gone to some higher responsibility in his new job, and the
14 difficulty with that is that it leads the Courts down a path
15 of looking at every case, whether there has been a change in
16 responsibility.

In many cases,

the jobs are pretty

17 difficult to compare.
18

I would also like to correct what I think is a

19 misstatement, and that is that the agency here never applied
20 5334(b).
21 increase.

It never gave these employees a two step
It gave them a one step increase under

22 misinterpretation of the regulations, not of the statute,
23 and in fact under the Court of Claims decision, the
24 Respondents here ended up with much higher salary increases
25 than they had even gotten under the original mistake.

One other point as far as this conversion in

1954

2 of the crafts protection schedule, as I pointed out earlier,
3 those employees were within the Classification Act, so if
4 Congress had not specified that this mass conversion was
5 excluded from 5334(b), 5334(b) by its terms would have
6 applied to those employees, but as we have argued, by its
7 terms, it does not apply and never has applied to WS
8 employees, and that can just be seen by looking at the
9 definition of the term "grade" as it existed back then, in
10 1954.
11

A s far as Kr . Justice Stevens ' earlier question to

12 me about the use of the word "in eludes" in the definition of
13 "grade", upo n lookin g at the def inition again, I think the
14 point is that grade includes all the jobs that are
15 classified at that particular grade, and I think the use of
16 the word "includes" makes sense there as being a collection
17 of all the different jobs, but in fact it is clear from the
18 context that it refers only to grades in the General
19 Schedule, there would be no reason for the Court -- for
20 Congress, rather, to have implied the WS system at the same
21 time.
