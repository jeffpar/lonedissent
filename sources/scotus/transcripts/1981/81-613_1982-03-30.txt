CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER.-

2

We will hear arguments

3 first this morning in Sporhase and Moss against
4 Nebraska.

Mr. Dudden, you may proceed

whenever you are

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. DUDDEN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS

7
8

MR. DUDDEN:

Thank you, Your Honor.

9

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the

10 Court:

We bring before you this morning a

11

12 constitutional law question

13 clause.

involving the commerce

Nebraska’s law prohibits the transportation of

14 water into another state unless that state has
15 reciprocal legislation.

Colorado has no reciprocal

16 legislation.
17

In

1971 the Nebraska Department of Water

18 Resources issued a well registration number for the well
19 that is in question today.

This registration filing

20 noted on its face that the

land in Colorado was to be

21 irrigated.

The well was then used by the Appellants'

22 predecessors to irrigate the agricultural land in

23 Nebraska.
24

But later on in 1971,

the Appellants purchased

25 this land from their predecessors and renewed their

1

intentions to irrigate the Colorado land.

2 approval

They obtained

to proceed from the manager of the local water

3 management district.

This approval included the

4 conveyance of water by pipeline from the well located in
5 Nebraska to the Appellants' adjacent land in Colorado.
The well itelf is located only a few feet from

6

7 the Colorado state line.
8

112 of the joint appendix,

If you were to look on page
there is a map that would

9 show you the location of the real estate involved and
10

the proximity of the well to the State of Colorado.

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. DUDDEN;

13 feet deep,

How deep is the well?
The well is approximately 300

Your Honor.

14

QUESTION;

How expensive to put it in?

15

MR. DUDDEN;

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. DUDDEN:

Mr. Justice White, the --

Is that In the record?

18 answer that question.

It is in the record, but I can
He expended approximately $45,000

19 for the installation of the underground pipe and the
20 installation of the pivot sprinkler irrigation
21
22

equipment .
QUESTION;

I suppose if he had put it six feet

23 on the other side of line, he’d have had the same
24 problem, I suppose?
25

MR. DUDDEN:

Yes, he would. Your Honor,

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1 because when you use a pivot sprinkler irrigation system
2 you pipe approximately 1300 feet to the center of the
3 field.
4

QUESTION;

But he would have the same

5 exportation problem.
6

MR. DUDDEN;

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. DUDDEN:

Into Nebraska?
Yes.
Yes, Your Honor. Colorado

has an

9 absolute prohibition from transporting water into
10 Nebraska.

11

QUESTION;

Do you think Colorado'sabsolute

12 prohibition is less vulnerable to commerce clause attack
13 than Nebraska's?
14

MR. DUDDEN;

15

QUESTION;

No,

I do not. Your Honor.

So you don't rely on the exception

16 for reciprocity that Nebraska makes?
17

MR. DUDDEN;

No,

I do not.

18

The land upon which the water --

19

QUESTION;

But don't you rely on the fact that

20 Nebraska -- with a permit he could do it?
21

MR. DUDDEN;

If the Appellant had a permit in

22 Nebraska -23

QUESTION;

Yes,

but the authorities could give

24 him a permit under Nebraska law.
25

MR. DUDDEN;

No,

they could not, because

1

Colorado does not have a reciprocity statute today --

2

QUESTION i

3

MR. DUDDEN:

4

I see.
-- to allow water to be

transported from Colorado into Nebraska.

5 crux of

That's the

the case, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION;

Okay, yes.

7

QUESTION;

Mr. Dudden, may I ask -- this, of

8 course,

is a commerce clause case, isn't it?
MR. DUDDEN;

9

QUESTION;

10

Yes, it is.
I notice that the state argues at

11

pages 22 and 23 of its brief that Congress has enacted

12

any number of statutes -- I think they say 37 of them --

13 which expressly operate to exempt regulation, allocation
14 and

distribution of water from the application of the

15 interstate clause,

leaving it to the individual states.

And I don't see that you’ve addressed that

16
17 argument.

Have you?
MR. DUDDEN;

18

I think we have, Your Honor.

19 haven't in my oral argument.
20 the Mining Act,
21

Act of 1902.

I

However, we are relying on

the Desert Land Act, and the Reclamation

It is our position that none of those acts

22 direct attention to water.

QUESTION;

23
24 section

Well, may I ask, have you any

of your brief which addresses that particular

25 argument?

I don't see a reply brief, for example.

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

MR. DUDDEN;

1

No,

we do not have that in our

2 brief in chief, Your Honor,

and we did not prepare a

3 reply brief, in view of the number of briefs that had
4 been submitted covering the issue.
QUESTION:

5

6 they were right and

Well, of course, if Congress -- if
Congress has done that, that's the

7 end of this case, isn’t it?
MR. DUDDEN;

8

It would be.

But Congress has

9 not done that, Your Honor.
QUESTION;

10
11

But we're going to have to find out

for ourselves, are we?

12

MR.

DUDDEN;

13

QUESTION;

That is correct.
Except that you're going to address

14 it in your oral argument.
15

MR. DUDDEN:

Yes,

I am.

16

The land upon which the water is to be used

17 from the Nebraska well is immediately adjacent to and
18 contiguous with the Nebraska land, as you will note on
19 the map.

Only a small gravel road -- and it’s not a

20 highway — separates these tracts.
21

Based upon the approval by the district, the

22 Appellant invested a large sum of money,

approximately

23 $45,000, to install the underground pipelines and
24 irrigation equipment, and commenced irrigating the
25 140-acre tract located in Colorado.

7

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

In 1976, the Nebraska Department of Water

1

2

Resources issued a letter to the Appellants ordering

3

them to cease transporting water from Nebraska into

4

Colorado.

5

Appellants in the state court to enjoin them from

6

irrigating the Colorado land from the Nebraska well.

Suit was brought by Nebraska against the

At that point in time the Appellants argued

7

8

that the law, the Nebraska law, was unconstitutional and

9

was in violation of the commerce clause.

The Nebraska

10

Supreme Court, however, affirmed the state court's

11

injunction and held the law constitutional, including

12

the mandatory reciprocity requirements which were

13

included in the Nebraska statute.
However, in that opinion Nebraska's Chief

14
15

Justice Krivosha vigorously dissented on the reciprocity

16

issue.

This appeal followed.
Nebraska held that water is not an article of

17
18

interstate commerce, and therefore the court concluded

19

that the commerce clause did not apply to the

20

reciprocity requirement.

21

today is whether water is a subject of commerce clause

22

standards.

23

The question before this Court

We know if this were any other natural

24

resource the Nebraska statute requiring reciprocity

25

would be unconstitutional under the commerce clause.

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

This Court in the Great Atlantic 6 Pacific Tea Company

2

case said that a state cannot discriminate or unduly

3

burden interstate commerce and that a mandatory

4

reciprocity clause or requirement is unconstitutional.
The question/ then, is whether water is

5

6

different from all other resources for commerce clause

7

purposes.

8

should be exempted from commerce clause standards, and

9

they argued this for three reasons;

10

Nebraska argues that water is unique and

First, Nebraska has defined water under its

11

state law as being publicly owned.

12

in Nebraska water is publicly owned and that Nebraska is

13

the public trustee of that water.

14
15
16

QUESTION;

We acknowledge that

When does its character change, if

it does change, from public to private?
HR. DUDDEN:

Your Honor, in Nebraska the

17

constitution declares that water is publicly owned by

18

the state and that the state is the trustee of that

19

water for its -- for persons, cities, municipalities,

20

corporations, and any other entity.

21

22
23

QUESTION;

That's up to a point.

After you've

got it in a water glass, what about that?
HR. DUDDEN;

Ky understanding or my feeling

24

is, Your Honor, that Nebraska believes that water is

25

publicly owned at all points in time, not when it is

9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

converted to use and not when it is converted, for

2 example, to personal property, such as being drawn from
3

a well; that any water in the state, regardless of where

4

it is located, is publicly owned by the state.
QUESTION;

5

Kell, you think that nobody can

6 transfer a water right in Nebraska and get paid for it?

MR. DUDDEN:

7

No, that is not -- we do not have

8 that position. Your Honor.

QUESTION;

9
10

Well, that isn't the Nebraska law,

is it ?

11

MR. DUDDEN;

12

The publicly owned philosophy, Justice White,

13

as I understand it, would be acting as a public trustee

14

for persons who desire to withdraw the water and put it

15

to a beneficial use.

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. DUDDEN:

No.

Go ahead.
And we acknowledge that public

18

trustee ownership.

And as long as a person, any person,

19

desires to withdraw water in Nebraska, they may do so

20 upon applying for permission.
21

The Court in the Hughes versus Oklahoma case,

22 this Court,

held that a declaration of public ownership,

23

such as has been done in Nebraska, is a mere fiction and

24

makes no difference for commerce clause purposes.

25

the Oklahoma case, Oklahoma claimed public ownership of

In

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

natural minerals much in the same way that Nebraska is

2 now attempting

to claim public ownership of water.

Both in Nebraska and Oklahoma, that claimed

3

4 ownership is regulatory in nature and is not proprietary
5 or commercial.

Since Nebraska is acting as a market

6 regulator and not as a market participant,
7 position that

it is our

Nebraska cannot discriminate against

8 interstate commerce.

Because Nebraska feels this way, they have

9

10 presented three arguments.
11

The second argument is that

water is different because Congress by federal act has

12 authorized

the western states to restrict interstate

13 transportation of

water.

While Congress may enact such legislation, it

14

15 is our position that it must do
16

unmistakable language*

17 and

so in clear and

Congress has not acted in clear

unmistakable language with regard to this subject.

18 Nebraska has relied for its basic references in
19 connection with the federal laws on the Mining Act of
20 1866,
21

the Desert Land Act of 1877, and the Reclamation

Act of 1902, alleging that these acts constitute

22 authorizations for

the states to prohibit or restrict

23 the interstate transportation of water.
24

However, none of these acts contain what this

25 Court has said, an affirmative grant of power to the

11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

states to burden interstate commerce.

They have -- none

2 of these acts contain that power.

In the Mining Act Congress opened up mineral

3

4 lands for use and development by citizens and confirmed
5 the vested water rights.
6 opened up desert

In the Desert Land Act they

lands for development by citizens and

7 confirmed vested water rights.
QUESTIONi

8

Well, didn't the case, the Portland

9 Cement case, in the thirties say that the Desert Land
10 Act severed
11

the waters from the land and gave the

control of the waters to the states?
MR. DUDDEN;

12

Your Honor, I believe that that

13 case and the case of California versus the United States
14 basically concluded that in operating under those acts
15 they must recognize the state water laws.

But they did

16 not say that the states had the power to preclude under
17 interstate commerce.

It was directed to a joining of

18 hands on those acts with the then current state laws.
And in the Reclamation Act of

19

20 provided for the sale of public lands,
21

1902, Congress
the proceeds of

which were to he used to fund the creation of irrigation

22 projects.

23

Therefore, while we agree that Congress could

24 authorize the states to prohibit water exports, much as
25 they exempted the insurance industry under the McCarran

12

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

amendment, it is clear that none of the acts cited by

2

Nebraska exempt water from commerce.
Finally, Nebraska argues that water is

3
4

physically unique.

However, a western water law

5

specialist, Professor Corker, would disagree with that

6

theory.
Professor Corker has written that water, from

7

8

whatever source, is not economically different from

9

other resources.

He points out that a beneficial

10

exchange of goods is a motivating force in trade and

11

commerce and concludes that this free market motivation

12

should be equally potent when one of the commodities is

13

water and -QUESTION:

14

Well, isn't that up to the states,

15

though, to a certain extent, to say whether or not a

16

particular natural resource is subject to ordinary

17

commerce within or without the state?

18

they say it is subject to commerce within the state,

19

they can't say it's not subject to commerce without the

20

sta te.

21

Certainly, if

But as I understand your description of the

22

Nebraska water law, it's that no one acquires a real fee

23

ownership in water.

24

subject to the public trust.

25

It's simply the right to use it

MR. DUDDEN:

That is correct.

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

QUESTION:

So really, Nebraska has taken a

2 position contrary to the one you attribute to Mr.

3 Corker, hasn't it?
4

MR.

DUDDEN:

Well, I don’t -- Nebraska has

5 taken the position that they can preclude the
6 transportation of water across state lines by requiring

7 other states to have reciprocal statutes.
8 argue that Nebraska

We don't

should not -- that Nebraska does not

9 have the power to control water.

What we’re arguing is

10

that they do not have the power to control water to the

11

extent that they can restrict commerce.

12

QUESTION:

Well, what if your client decided

13 that they wanted to sell topsoil and wanted to take all
14 the topsoil off of the

140 acres, or whatever it is that

15 you're talking about, and simply ship it to someone else
16 in another state, and the State of Nebraska says, no,
17 topsoil simply isn't a marketable commodity, we’re not
18 going to allow you to ship topsoil anywhere because it’s
19 just too bad for the land?
20
21

MR. DUDDEN:

I think it would depend, Justice

Pehnquist, on how Nebraska worded their law with regard

22 to the preclusion

to transport it across state lines.

23 In this particular instance, they are requiring the
24 neighboring state to have a reciprocity clause in their
25 law in order to allow that water to be transported.

other words

2

QUESTION;

I thought you didn’t rely on that?

3

MR. DUDDEN;

In other words, their tests are

4

reasonable use, waste and private welfare for the State

5

of Nebraska.

6

may not transport water into another state unless that

7

state reciprocates with Nebraska.

8
9

And then they add, and in addition, you

We’re contending that that is one step too
far, and that in-state water users should be afforded

10

the same equal treatment as out-state water users under

11

the commerce clause.

12
13
14

QUESTION;

I thought you didn't rely on the

reciprocity provision.
MR. DUDDEN;

Well, we are -- I’m not sure,

15

Your Honor, how to interpret the word "rely," what you

16

mean by the word "rely."

17

QUESTION;

Well, that that was an important

18

part of your case or, you know, a significant part of

19

your case, that the Nebraska law provided for

20

reciprocity.

21

22

MR. DUDDENj
reciprocity.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. DUDDEN;

25

Nebraska law requires

Yes.
And without relying on that,

without that statute being in or of record in Nebraska,

15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

the Appellant in this instance would be eligible for a

2 permit to use water in Colorado.

QUESTION:

3

Well, do you think your case is

4

stronger than if Nebraska had an absolute prohibition

5

against the interstate transportation of water?
MR. DUDDEN:

6

I think that an absolute

7

prohibition of the interstate transportation of water

8

and the Nebraska statute are identical today.
QUESTION;

9
10

So you would be making the same

a rg uments?

11

MR. DUDDEN;

12

QUESTION:

Yes, I would.
Do you contend that Colorado’s

13

prohibition against shipping out of state, water out of

14

state, is also unconstitutional?

15

MR. DUDDEN:

16

QUESTION:

Yes, I do, Your Honor.
Then I suppose it really doesn’t --

17

if you were right on that -- does Colorado follow the

18

same rule of law that Nebraska does on water rights?
MR. DUDDEN:

19

20

is different in terms of ownership.
QUESTION:

21

22
23
24
25

No, their basic foundational law

Do they treat it just like

Oklahoma ?
MR. DUDDEN:

They do not consider themselves

to be public trustees of the water.
QUESTION:

Is their law substantially the same

16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

as Oklahoma's in that earlier case?

2

MR. DUDDEN;

3

QUESTION;

4

MR. DUDDEN;

Yes.
Or Texas, whichever it was.
Similar, similar — not the Texas

5

law.

No, not the Texas law.

6

English law, which is absolute ownership.

7

talking about the Aldus case, Your Honor --

8

QUESTION;

9

MR. DUDDEN;

10

The Texas law is the old
And if you're

Yes.
-- no, Colorado's law is a

modified law and is a modified American law.

You have

11
12

QUESTION;

In your complaint, you didn't, or

13

did you, expressly attack the constitutionality of the

14

Colorado statute?

15
16
17

MR. DUDDEN;

No, we have not attacked the

Colorado statute.
QUESTION;

If you persuaded the Court that

18

that statute is invalid, then I suppose you would have

19

-- then the reciprocity provision of the Colorado

20

statute would h3ve no longer been a bar.

21

MR. DUDDEN;

22

QUESTION;

But you —

MR. DUDDEN;

It isn *t.
It is not, no.

QUESTION;

Now, tell me again.

Under Nebraska

law, can -- are water rights transferable between

MR. DUDDEN;

13

Yes, they are. Your Honor.
For money?
For money.
And are they — are they -- can

they be separated from the land?
MR. DUDDEN;

14

Yes, I believe they could be.

15

However, in most instances, Your Honor, the transfer of

16

water for money is involved in the price of the land.

Yes, in Nebraska.
In Nebraska.

Now, in that sense

it's an article of commerce.
MR. DUDDEN:

Absolutely, absolutely.
But he cannot -- he could not under

this law, I take it, sell that water right to somebody

That is correct, Your Honor.

Is there a limitation to the particular aquifer

QUESTIONS

Not at the present time, no.
Counsel, the State of Nebraska has

4

also argued that we should look at the interstate

5

compacts that have been approved by Congress --

6

ME. DUDDENs

7

QUESTION;

Yes.
-- as an indicator that Congress

8

believes that states are free to allocate and direct the

9

transfer of water within their boundaries.
ME. DUDDENs

10

Yes, they do, Justice O'Connor.

11

Interstate compacts, however, are for purposes of states

12

agreeing to use water from one state and move it into

13

another.

14

compact, called the Platte Eiver Compact, in this area,

15

where the State of Nebraska and the State of Colorado

16

joined together and agreed to allow water to be

17

withdrawn from the Platte Eiver in Colorado and

18

transported by canal into Nebraska.

19

by Congress.

20

We have just such an impact -- just such a

This was approved

It 's our position that these compacts do not

21

in any case, in any specific instance, represent a

22

specific, clear language by the Congress to remove water

23

from interstate commerce.

24

contracts between the states to help the states

25

transport water back and forth among themselves,

They simply are agreements or

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

400 VIRGINIA AVE., S.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20024 (202) 554-2345

1

actually contrary to our position, because here Nebraska

2 is attempting to keep water from being

transported from

3 Colorado into Nebraska, when the compacts generally are
4 to allow water to go from one state to another by state
5 agreement.

It is our position that the purpose of the

6

7 commerce clause is to encourage a national market for
8 all resources and to encourage maximum economic
9 efficiency in the use of these resources.
10 reciprocity

11

The mandatory

clause in the Nebraska law is hostile to

this area and idea.
Reciprocity is not necessary to remove other

12
13 states’

embargoes, because the commerce clause by itself

14 creates the
15 Chief

necessary reciprocity.

Furthermore, our

Justice has said, in the opinion of the Sporhase

16 case that reciprocity is unnecessary to carry out
17 Nebraska’s conservation goals.
18

The reciprocity of the Nebraska statute has no

19 connection

to the need or availability of water, and it

20 is clear that the remaining part of

Nebraska’s law would

21 be adequate without the reciprocity provisions,

as it

22 already provides for reasonable uses, conservation and
23 concern for
24

public welfare.

QUESTION*

Yes, it is.
But nevertheless, you were given

That is correct. Your Honor.

6 critical

township or critical area at the time that it

7 was approved and drilled.
8

QUESTION;

I see.

9

MR. DUDDENs

And that the withdrawal from that

10

well has always been used in all calculations by the

11

district and by the state in connection with withdrawals

12 of water in

that area.

To allow our client to continue

13 to use this well for the purpose which he is doing
14 would make no difference on
15 the State of

today

the use or public welfare of

Nebraska.

It's our position that we don't need to have

16

17 discrimination against interstate commerce or interstate
18 uses of water and there is no justification for it.
19 What our Appellant asks of

this Court is that the

20 commerce clause is exactly

what the commerce clause

21

provides, and that would be that in-state water users

22 and out of state water users be afforded equal

QUESTION;

If you think water is an article of

21 mean Congress couldn't insist -- remove state barriers

MR. DUDDEN;

As long as their statutes do not

24 interfere with the interstate clause of the United
25 States Constitution, they might be able to do that.

In

which is printed in the appendix, and I'm

in irrigation.

we're talking about used in irrigation?

MR. ANDERSON;

We're not —

This is irrigation.
I didn't suggest that, Your

21

Honor.

We are dealing with irrigation in the case at

22

bar, and the Supreme Court was ruling, our Nebraska

23

Supreme Court, was ruling on that in the case.

24

that as far as irrigation water goes in agriculture, it

25

is not subject to ownership, to sale to market-setting,

and it is not subject to the commerce clause.
We would urge, Your Honor, that you affirm the

Nebraska Supreme Court finding that water is a unique

4

resource, different from the other natural resources of

5

natural gas, et cetera, and would affirm the Nebraska

Supreme Court.

Thank you.

Court*

16

I think it is important to point out that if

17

this mandatory reciprocity requirement were eliminated

18

that there still would remain on the books and records

19

of the Nebraska statutes adequate law to allow the state

20

of Nebraska to evenhandedly control and regulate water.

21

They would do this by determining reasonable uses and

22

setting forth those reasonable uses, so that people

23

could calculate whether or not they were making

24

reasonable use of the water, by conducting

25

administrative hearings and by issuing well permits

specifically restricting the use of water as to the

2

particular purpose requested.
They do not need to have a mandatory

3
4

reciprocal requirement in order to control water in

5

Nebraska.
I would like to point out to the Court that

6
7

there is no case in the state of Nebraska that

8

specifically defines overlying land, and that has been

9

discussed quite a bit this morning.

10

I would also like to mention that it is our

11

opinion that Congress does have the power to regulate

12

concerning water, as has been asked by this Court.

13

the question that's really before the Court today is<

14

What is the law under the commerce clause when Congress

15

has not clearly and unmistakeably legislated on the

16

question ?

17

But

It is our position that, in view of all of the

18

Acts that have been mentioned in counsel's opposing

19

brief by the State of Nebraska, none of those Acts use

20

clear and unmistakeable language --

21

QUESTION:

What you’re saying is, if we're to

22

say that Congress has said the states are free and

23

there's no commerce clause, whatever it may be, Congress

24

gives it up, they have to say so in explicit words?

25

MR. DUDDEN:

That is correct.

And I’m saying
