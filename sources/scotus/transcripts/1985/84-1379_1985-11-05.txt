of the cases that have been argued before this Court

2

where intervenors have argued, for example, on the

3

parental consent cases, have all appeared before this

4

Court and argued and this Court has granted standing.

5

Perhaps it was not a specific issue in those

6

cases, but nonetheless they did appear as intervenors,

7

did appeal, and did appear before this Court in

argument.

because 6-1, it said,

does not specify who must make the

sections of the statuta, namely 2-2, which defines

viability as a medical judgment of the attending

physician based on the particular facts of the case

before him.

In addition, another section, 6-5, requires

that there be absolutely no tradeoff in terms of risk.

18

Any medical risk involved vitiates the import of 6-1.

19

That is to say, a physician need not follow 6-1 if in

20

doing so, that is to say in selecting a method of

21

abortion or using a standard of care to save the viable

child, it would in any way increase the risk to the

PETER CAREY, ESQ.,

MR. CAREY;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

In an attempt to promote the State's theory of

5
6

fetal life, the Illinois statute unconstitutionally

7

overrides the physician's obligation to protect the life

8

and health of a woman needing medical care, and further,

9

requires a physician to deliver a morally charged and

10

medically inaccurate message based upon the State’s

11

theory of life to patients seeking contraceptive

12

advice.
The legal questions raised in this appeal were

13
14

correctly settled by the Seventh Circuit's application

15

of the principles enunciated in Roe, Colautti, and

16

Akron.

fertilization and then requiring the physician to

espouse that theory to his patients seeking

The State accomplishes this by defining "human

human being from fertilization until live birth.

8

"Abortifacient" is defined under Section 210 as any drug

or device which causes fetal death, whether or not the

Choice of abortion technique, as this Court

recognized in Colautti, is a complicated medical

judgmr..t, about which physicians can and do disagree.

Intervenor’s unsupported assertion that certain

techniques were developed to injure fetuses ignores the

fact that these same techniques reduce risks to women

7

whose life and health is threatened in a post-viability

abortion situation.

the threat to the woman, the skills of the physician,

of these techniques makes compliance with 5-1
