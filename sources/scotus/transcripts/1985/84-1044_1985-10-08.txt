ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT L. HARRIS, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

5

MR. HARRIS:

6

9

Mr. Harris, I think you

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case comes from the State of California which
has order Pacific Gas and Electric Company to include in

10

its monthly billing envelope the fund solicitation messages

11

of a third party.

12

13
14

We are required to include the message four times
per year for a two-year period.
For the past 60 years, PG&E has used the billing

15

envelope to communicate its message through the PG&E Progress.

16

The envelope has never been open to the public.

17

The California Supreme Court refused to hear

18

Appellant's petition for writ of review, thus upholding

19

the Commission's decision.

20
21

22

That decision was appealed to this Court, which
noted probable jurisdiction.
The issue presented on appeal is whether or not

23

the State of California can, consistent with the First

24

Amendment to the United States Constitution, compel Pacific

25

Gas and Electric Company, a privately owned, public utility,

1

to include in its monthly billing envelope the fund solicitatic

2

of a third party, in this case, TURN, Toward Utility Rate

3

Normalization.

4

Utility speech is protected by the First Amendment.

5

In Consolidated Edison, this Court decided in 1980 that

6

the State of New York could not regulate the political speech

7

that Consolidated Edison put in the billing envelope unless

8

the state showed a compelling state interest for that

9

regulation.

10
11

The right not to carry the message of others applies,
indeed, to a corporation.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. HARRIS:

What case holds that?
First National Bank of Boston versus

14

Bellotti, decided in 1978.

15

faced with the issue as to whether or not the corporation

16

was entitled to the protection of the First Amendment. As

17

a matter of fact, that was the first time the issue was

18

squarely presenteu to this Court.

19

In that case, this Court was

And, Justice Powell writing for the Court, said

20

that the inherent worth of speech is not determined by identity

21

He said that you look not to the identity of the person

22

who is asserting the right, you look to see if the right

23

that is being asserted is a right that is protected by the

24

First Amendment.

25

QUESTION:

Did that case hold that the kind of

(202) 628-9300

1

Wooley versus Maynard type of First Amendment rights the

2

right not to carry a message you don't agree with applied

3

to corporations?.

4
5

MR. HARRIS:

That case was not faced with that

issue.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. HARRIS:

Do, it didn't hold it?
It did not hold that a person had

8

a right — that a corporation had a right not to carry some­

9

body else's message.

10
11
12

QUESTION:

So, what case of ours do you rely for

that proposition?
MR. HARRIS:

There is no case that specifically

13

holds that in the case of a corporation, however, we do

14

rely heavily upon at least two cases, Miami Herald versus

15

Tornillo and Wooley versus Maynard.

16

In the. Miami Herald case, the Court held that

17

the.State of Florida could not compel the Miami Herald to

18

publish the reply messages of third parties and in that

19

decision Chief Justice Burger, writing for che Court, indicated

20

that although the State of Florida made good arguments in

21

terms of why a wide variety of views are necessary or desired,

22

but the Court says in each instance where there is an enforced

23

right of excess — access — necessarily calls for some

24

mechanism, either consentual or governmental.

25

QUESTION:

Do you think there is a difference

ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

between a newspaper, which is not a regulated enterprise,

2

and a public utility, which is quite strictly regulated,

3

a difference f^r these purposes?

4

MR. HARRIS:

For these purposes, I think that

5

the same principle that applies in Tornillo should apply

6

here.

7

The mere fact of regulation, as this Court

8

indicated in Consolidated Edison, does not preclude a utility

9

from asserting First Amendment rights.

10
11
12

In Tornillo, the difference, of course, is that
Tornillo involved a newspaper.
Here we are involved with a situation where you

13

have a utility's billing envelope.

14

the same; that is, as the Court said in Tornillo, newspapers

15

should not be compelled to publish that which reason tells

16

them should not be published.

17

If
9

20

But, the principle is

Here a utility should not be compelled to carry
a message in th^ billing envelope that reason tells it should
not be carried.
QUESTION:

Yes, but hasn't the Court distinguished

21

between different kinds of media?

22

example, involving the fairness doctrine who was dealing

23

with the broadcast station which is regulated in a sense

24

and yet the broadcasters are required to do certain things.

25

MR. HARRIS:

The Red Lion case, for

1

Lion did not rest upon the basis that the broadcasters had

2

a monopoly.

3

using a scarce resource that was not open to the public.

4

It rested rather upon the basis that they were

Here, the mail is not a scarce resource.

And,

5

as the Court reasoned in Red Lion, and again emphasized

6

in Consolidated Edison, is that a broadcaster can only

7

communicated through those scarce resources.
QUESTION:

8

Mr. Harris, do you concede that the

9

Public Utilities Commission can- require PG&E to carry in

10

its billing envelopes notices of public rate hearings or

11

things of that kind?

12

MR. HARRIS:

13

carried such notices.

14

QUESTION:

Justice O'Connor, we have, indeed,
We are willing to do that.
Well, I am asking if you concede whether

15

the Public Utilities Commission can properl 7, under the

16

First Amendment, require the company to do chat?

17

MR. HARRIS:

18

QUESTION:

19

20

Yes, we do concede that.
And, why is that difffrent in your

view?
MR. HARRIS:

That is different because in the

21

case of a government notice, here an informational notice,

22

informing utility customers that a hearing is going to be

23

on such and such date or that there is a public health or

24

safety matter pending somewhere concerning the utility,

25

it is quite different from compelling PG&E to carry in its

4

QUESTION:

Does this argument suggest, Mr. Harris,

5

that the PUC order that we have before us, you would not

6

object to it if they permitted TURN to insert only factual

7

matter that dealt with the public utility business?

8

MR. HARRIS:

9

We would object to it because we would be forced

10

No, it would not, Justice Brennan.

to carry —

11

QUESTION:

I asked you that question because I

12

thought you answered Justice O'Connor that the PUC could

13

require you to insert matter that dealt with rates.

14

MR. HARRIS:

As I understand Justice O'Connor,

15

it was whether or not we could be compelled to carry a state's

16

notice.

17
18

As I understand your question, it is whether or
not we can be compelled to carry a private person's notice.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HARRIS:

21

That is right.
And, no, we cannot, I don't think,

consistent with the First Amendment unless the state shows

22

a compelling state interest for ordering us to do it.

23

rely on Wooley versus Maynard.

No, it is not the death or die.

(202) 628-9300

1

We also rely on the general principles of the

2

First Amendment and that is compelling someone to speak

3

when there are other ways available.

4

QUESTION:

Are you going so far as to suggest

5

that a corporation's negative First Amendment right, as

6

you perceive, is co-extensive with the individual?
MR. HARRIS:

7

Yes.

I think that this Court intimated

8

that to a certain extent in Harper and Row versus Nation

9

Enterprise by Justice O'Connor where she indicated and cited

10

really that the right to speak also necessarily includes

11

the right not to speak.

12

Chief Judge Poole in terms of how they serve the same

13

ultimate purpose.
Tha purpose that is being served here is the right

14
15

And then she quotes New York's

not to be compelled to carry someone else's message.
QUESTION:

16

It makes no difference whether it is

17

an individual or a corporation?

18

MR. HARRIS:

I don't think it is any different

19

at all whether it is an individual or a corporation.

20

cannot look and say in the one instance this is a corporation,

21

therefore, you carry the message without regard to anything

22

else.

23

involved.

24
25

You

I think you have to look at the nature of a right
Is that right protected by the First Amendment.
Here, the right involved is the right not to carry

the message of someone else.

QUESTION:

Is there any difference with a utility?

2

MR. HARRIS:

I think there is a difference.

I

3

don't think there is any difference whether it is a utility

or any other corporation.

QUESTION:

Did the state order the utility to

MR. HARRIS:

MR. HARRIS:

Yes, indeed, Your Honor.
Well, there is a difference.
Yes, there is a difference if it

is the message of the state.

11

party, then I would disagree.

12

QUESTION:

If it is a message of a third

Why shouldn't it or why doesn't it

13

make a difference, as the Court below held, that the extra

14

space in an envelope doesn't belong to the utility?

15
16

MR. HARRIS:

It is true that the Commission below

held that the extra space does not belong to the individual.

17

QUESTION:

It doesn't belong to the utility.

Yes.

Yes.
It doesn't matter because what we

23

are talking about is the regulation of what goes into the

24

billing envelope.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but the space doesn't

belong to the utility, it belongs to the consumer, it was

2

held below, right?

3

to fill up that space that belongs to the consumer with —

4

periodically with something that we think the consumer would

5

be more interested in.

6

So, the Commission said we are going

MR. HARRIS:

It is true that that is what the

7

Commission held.

8

cannot depend upon a metaphysical definition of space.

9
10

But, we argue that the First Amendment

QUESTION:

How does the First Amendment give the

utility the right to use that space?

11

MR. HARRIS:

12

White, in addition —

13

QUESTION:

14

ride on that space.

15

What we are talking about, Justice

We are talking about who gets a free

MR. HARRIS:

If the question is who gets a free

16

ride, the Commission can certainly deal with that question

17

by assessing an economic value to that extra space.

18

But, here, in older for the consumer group to

19

use that space, they must use an envelope, an envelope that

20

the Commission has not said belongs to the rate payer.

21

And, in using that envelope we are compelled to associate,

22

we are compelled to be the courier of someone else's

23

message and we think that is protected by the First Amendment.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Harris, a moment ago you referred

to the Harper and Row opinion and the suggestion that the
11

(202) 628-9300

1

right to speak and the right not to speak are somewhat

2

similar.

3

equivalent to the right not to speak?

Do you think the right not to be a courier is

4

MR. HARRIS:

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. HARRIS:

7

QUESTION:

8

I think it is very, very close.
It is clearly not the same, is it?
They are not identical, no.
Does any consumer object to having

the consumer space in the envelope used in this manner?

9

MR. HARRIS:

We don't know, Your Honor.

That

10

wasn't part of the record below.

11

many consumers will object, because there are many consumer

12

groups.

13

QUESTION:

But, I would suspect that

Wouldn't you say the Commission would

14

have the power to order — to prevent the utility from

15

putting anything in the envelope except the bill?

16
17
18
19

20
21

MR. HARRIS:

QUESTION:
to the utility.

Well, why?

The space doesn't belong

Why should it get a ride out of it?

MR. HARRIS:

But, the outcome of this case does

not turn upon who owns the extra space.
QUESTION:

23

MR. HARRIS:

25

I think that would

clearly reverse Consolidated Edison.

22

24

I don't think'so.

But, it does on who owns the envelope.
Well, I don't think it necessarily

turns on who owns the envelope either.
QUESTION:

Well, that is the way you are being

MR. HARRIS:

The envelope has not been held to

Whatever is in that envelope is

Of course, PG&E could change that very

8

easily if it wanted to by saying PG&E and then adding TURN

9

to the envelope, I mean, if it disliked the notion that

10
11

it was misleading people.
MR. HARRIS:

Then the association would become

12

even worse because there you have both PG&E and TURN being

13

the sender uf the bill.

14

is to send a bill.

15

The purpose of the billing envelope

Even aside from any other locument included therein,

16

it is the forced association, the forced compulsion to speak

17

when we prefer not to speak that is at issue here.

18

QUESTION:

Don't you thin], there is some difference

19

between the loyal, fiesty citizen c£ New Hampshire who didn't

20

believe in live free or die and, therefore, didn't want

21

to carry it on his license plate, kind of an individual

22

thing that always struck me, though I must say I didn't

23

agree with the result in that case, and the corporation.

24

I don't see quite the same personality element there.

25

MR. HARRIS:

It is not the same personality, of
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

course, but it is the right that is involved, the right

2

not to be the courier of someone else's message that I think

3

is at stake here.
In Wooley, live free or die.

4

Here, we carry

5

whatever the message may be that is given to us from TURN

6

into a billing envelope that we have mailed out for over

7

60 years.

8

with PG&E.

People associate what we mail in the PG&E envelope

QUESTION:

9

Can't you, under the Commission's ruling,

10

put a disclaimer on what you circulate, saying this is not

11

produce by PG&E or something like that?

12

MR. HARRIS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HARRIS:

The opportunity to put a disclaimer —
TURN has to under the order.
Under the order, TURN must put a

15

disclaimer.

But, a disclaimer would not clear the violation.

16

As I indicated, for over 60 years this has been the PG&E

17

envelope.

18

opportunity to disclaim an inaccurate or an inflammatory

19

message will not suffice to undo whatever damage that may

20

have been done by including the message.

The forced association causes the injury.

more about the nature of the damage to the corporation.

QUESTION:

It is kind of an insult.

2

MR. HARRIS:

3

QUESTION:

It is reputation.
Now, what is it?

Does it adversely

4

affect the reputation or it is misleading or how does it

5

hurt the corporation?

6

MR. HARRIS:

It affects us .in this way.

Over

7

the years, we have expended a lot of money building up the

8

image of PG&E, building up our corporate image.

9

extent —

10
11

QUESTION:

To the

Is it part of your image that you don't

like people to oppose rate increases?

12

(Laughter)

13

MR. HARRIS:

No, Your Honor.

We have not even

14

carried the message of those who support rate increases.

15

We have not carried the message o1 anyone other than PG&E,

16

although we have been requested by numerous jurisdictions,

17

including the City and County of San Francisco to carry

18

its messages.

19

But, as you can probably see, once we become involved

20

in that, then we find ourselves irretrievably entangled

21

in a mess.

22

This order requires that the PUC place itself

23

in the position of selecting the speakers.

24

who uses this envelope, whether it is TURN or some other

25

person.

In other words,

They must first come to the Commission, must first
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

indicate to the Commission the subject matter that it intends

2

to talk about.

3

must indicate whethe ror not the viewpoint expressed is

4

one that is in support of PG&E or opposed to PG&E, because,

5

as the decision said, it is the purpose to get a variety

6

of views in addition and opposed to PG&E.

7

Once it indicates that, then the person

I think the government really will become so entangle d,

8

unlike in PruneYard, in picking and choosing speakers, that

9

government will end up being the ultimate arbitrator of

10

what is or what is not said.

11

QUESTION:

Suppose a citizens' committee is

12

organized in favor of public ownership of all utilities.

13

Under this order, could that committee put its material

14

out through the monthly bills?
MR. HARRIS:

15

If the Commission so decrees.

It

16

is up to the Commission.

17

can allow anyone that it pleases to use the envelope.

18

they need do is file a complaint and if the Commission believes

19

that the subject matter is proper or the viewpoint expressed

20

is proper, then the Commission will allow — will compel

21

us to carry that message.

QUESTION:

A Committee for One Million, Proposition 36, a Jarvis/Gann

initiative, applied to the Commission because they wanted

3

to indicate to rate payers that there was a measure on the

ballot that would affect rate payers.

and that is in the Appendix to the Jurisdictional Statement,

said that because it did not directly relate to a Commission

QUESTION:

But, the Commission,

How about solar energy?

I guess you

wouldn't mind carrying that, would you?

10

MR. HARRIS:

We have carried Commission notices

11

concerning solar energy before, but we have not been compelled

12

to carry the messages, for example, of a private corporation

13

in the solar industry who wants to promote his particular

14

device, as TURN is trying to promote its —

16

MR. HARRISr

17
18

That is the one I was talking about.
We have not been compelled to do

that.
QUESTION:

Suppose sone group came in wich material,

19

information, propaganda, whatever you want to call it, about

20

tariffs, uring that tariffs be put on all imports from Japan.

21

Would the Commission have the authority to have that

22

circulated?

23

MR. HARRIS:

Under this order, of course, it would,

24

but I don't think that the Commission would necessarily

25

have the authority to compel us to carry that message as

promulgated.
I think it is important to remember that we do

3

nut take the position that the Commission can never compel

4

And, in the instant case, the Commission, we don't
think has met its burden of proof of showing that there
is a compelling state interest for carrying TURN messages.
The Commission already has California state law

12

which says specifically that intervenor funding can be given

13

to people who intervene in rate cases.

For example, the Commission has awarded more than

15

$160,000 to TURN during the past year, the last two years.

Pending now before the Commission is an application for

17

over $800,000 by some other consumer group.

So, the Commission already has at its disposal

a very clear mechanism for taking care of a problem that

it wants to resolve.

In order to put this case —

QUESTION:

13

Would you raise your voice some, Mr.

14

MR. FOGELMAN:

15

In order to put this case in its proper perspective,

Yes, Your Honor.

16

it is important to step back a moment and look at what the

Doesn't it produce the revenue?

MR. FOGELMAN:

12

and all of their operating expenses are recovered in rates,

13

I believe.

QUESTION:

Well, aren't the operating expenses

shared by the rate payers and the stockholders?
MR. FOGELMAN:

It is my understanding that 100

17

percent of operating expenses would be recovered.

18

costs which are unreasonable or imprudent would be disallowed

19

from the rate base and would be borne by the shareholders.

20
21

22

QUESTION:

Of course,

What are the limits on how this

authority of the Commission can be used?
MR. FOGELMAN:

The Commission is limited by its

23

state-authorized authority under the State Constitution

24

and it is limited by the United States Constitution.

25

Insofar as it does not violate the principles

of either of those authorities, it is essentially free to

2

regulate public utilities in the public interest.

3

With respect to ordering a public utility to carry

4

the messages of a third party, it is difficult to pose the

5

precise limits.

the Commission ultimately will be required to decide in

7

pursuing this program.

There are probably many questions which

MR. FOGELMAN:

1

Because the purpose of this program,

2

the primary purpose, the reason why the state has done what

3

it has done here, is to permit consumer groups to solicit

4

funds to increase their participation in Commission proceedings

5

involving PG&E.
And, insofar as the access furthers that primary

purpose, access would be granted.

8

the Commission could enlarge the scope of the program.

though that — for the order was that the space belongs

11

to the consumer, and, hence, we will act as proxy for the

consumer and send them out something that we think they

might be interested in.

MR. FOGELMAN:

QUESTION:

Why is it res judiccica here?

it was decided in an earlier proceeding that the extra space

in the envelope is rate payer property.

and in this case, the Commission refused to allow that

The first was

The second was a present, current involvement

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

difference to this decision, because I believe that the

2

Public Utilities Commission, under its broad regulatory

3

powers, has an authority on the objective facts of this

case to enter the order that it did, even if the space

5

inside the envelope were deemed utility property.

6

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, let's assume that the bill

takes — There is no spare space in an envelope and the

8

PUC orders the utility to use a larger envelope and to let

TURN put its material in it as long as TURN pays for it.

Well, Mr. Harris, isn't your general

regulatory rationale really foreclosed by the Consolidated

MR. FOGELMAN:

7
8

No, it is not, Your Honor, for

a couple of reasons.
QUESTION:

9

It seems very similar.

MR. FOGELMAN:

10

Well, the big distinction there

11

is that Consolidated Edison involves a restriction on

12

utility speech.
It is very important, I think, for this Court

3
4

to look at the purposes of the First Amendment which underlies

5

the difference between affirmative speech and negative speech

6

rights.

7

Insofar as someone is attempting to speak, and

8

the state says you can't speak, you have a situatior. where

9

the marketplace of ideas, society's interest in obtaining

20

information, wide-open debate, is limited and that is the

21

Consolidated Edison case.

22

QUESTION:

Well, in some cases, the Court has

23

indicated at least that there is a concomitant right not

24

to speak, has it not?

25

MR. FOGELMAN:

Yes, it has, Your Honor.
->0

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

But,

1

the underlying purposes which serve the right not to speak,

the right to refrain from speaking and to refrain from associat

It is, and this is not to be trivialized, it is

QUESTION:

It is the scantity and integrity
It is the interest

And, you take the position that that

10

does not extend to a corporation?

11

MR. FOGELMAN:

I take the position that it does

12

not extend to a corporation which is an artificial entity.

13

Furthermore, that it certainly doesn't extend to a public

14

utility which is a very heavy regulated artificial entity.

15

Furthermore, I don't believe that it is co-extensive

16

with the affirmative counterpart which serves entirely

17

different interests.

18

QUEST}ON:

Does it strike you that the Commission's

19

theory about broader participation or expression of a variety

20

of views is basically a content-based determination?

21

Commission has to look at what it is that TURN is doing

22

and wants to say as the basis for its order that it be allowed

23

to use the envelope.

24
25

MR. FOGELMAN:

The

The order in a broad sense is

content-neutral, because the Commission has disavowed any

intention of looking at the way that TURN solicits funds.

2

However, there is a limited purpose —

3

QUESTION:

It certainly has to look at the nature

4

of what TURN is doing and saying in order to decide that

5

it is going to order that its message be carried.

6

MR. FOGELMAN:

Well, to the extent that TURN'S

7

speech might hypothetically — and, again, this has never

8

occurred — I might say in a similar experience, the UCAN

9

situation, no problem certainly developed over a two-year

10

period, but assuming that TURN were to exceed the purposes

11

of the program and to make — engage in some sort of use

12

of the extra space, which was not a solicitation of funds, '

13

in that situation the Commission would have to look at that.

14

I am not sure precisely what —
QUESTION:

15

At least it is content-based because —

At least it says we prefer to have TURN'S material in this

extra space than the company's.

MR. FOGELMAN:

Isn't that right?

It prefers TURN'S to the company's material.
MR. FOGELMAN:

Could the Federal Communications Commission come down with

5

an order and have it constitutionally enforced providing

6

that no prime minister of any other country or any chief

of state of any other country could be on the television

program unless it was approved by the State Department?

That is quite a difficult hypothetical

It certainly is not this case.

QUESTION:

They are both regulated industries.

12

MR. FOGELMAN:

I am not sure, Your Honor, but

13

it is a heavily regulated medium of communication, that

14

is the airwaves.
QUESTION:

15

Well, a broadcast station, not necessarily

16

a network — a broadcasting station is more regulated than

17

the electric utility in the sense that the Federal

18

Communicaticns Commission can ■* erminate their license and

19

put them of: the air every three years, I think it is.

20
21

MR. FOGELMAN:

24
25

On the other

hand —

22
23

That is true.

QUESTION:

That is pretty heavy regulation, isn't

it?
MR. FOGELMAN:

That is heavy regulation.

Of course,

the state here has granted a monopoly to a public utility
35
ALDERSON REPO*.. iG COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON Z.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

and it is only at the pleasure of the state that the utility
has that monopoly and it is to protect the public that the
state regulates the public utility in the public interest.
QUESTION:

Is an example of the sort of corporate

First Amendment right that would be sustained the Tornillo
case where certainly the Miami Press was a corporation and
its First Amendment right to publish obviously allowed it
not to have to carry the messages of others.
MR. FOGELMAN:

Well, the Tornillo case, in our

view, does not turn on the fact that the Miami HearId was
a corporation.
QUESTION:

No.

The press freedom extends to

private individuals or corporations alike.

And, I take

saying.

Well, no, that is not what we are

In some sense, a pamphlet, a documei.t like Progress,

would be equivalent to a newspaper.
PG&E's position is that the billing envelope,
the medium of delivery of its newspaper, is somehow subject
to inviolable editorial discretion and that is not the case.
QUESTION:

Would Tornillo come out any differently

if the Florida statute had said along with the newspaper
you have to put in a little envelope that you delivery the

2

MR. FOGELMAN:

3

It doesn't have to be in the paper

I think it might well have come

4

out differently, particularly if the supplement were clearly

5

identified as being the views of the speaker, and, further­

6

more, if there were no cost to the newspaper.
One of the critical features of Tornillo on which

7

8

that case turned was the fact that there was a penalty on

9

the affirmative speech of the newspaper.

Because the newspaper

10

spoke about certain subjects, the right-of-reply statute

11

was triggered and space had to be given.
That is not involved here because TURN gets access

12

13

to the billing envelope under this program no matter what

PG&E says.

MR. FOGELMAN:

I think it is fair to say that

the Commission only recently discovered the existence of

the extra space, this income-generating asset.

at that point it had a problem.

Putting my question just in a little

8

different form, do you think the case would be precisely

the same in terms of its constitutional issues if the utility

10

had never made use of the space for a similar purpose?

11
12

MR. FOGELMAN:

I think it would be quite similar,

yes.
QUESTION:

13

Well, could the Commission order that

14

any unused offices in PG6E buildings be turned over to TURN

15

for its office space and that sort of thing?
MR. FOGELMAN:

16

Well, the Commission has an obliga­

17

tion to see that the utility operates in an efficient manner

18

and to the extent that unused offices are not be „ng used,

19

the Commission can make PG&E rent them out presumably. But,

20

that is not this case.

21

If I may address some critical points here, I

22

think there are five critical aspects of this decision that

23

preclude the notion that there is a violation of the First

24

Amendment.

25

First, there is no limitation on the continuing

3

envelope.

4

to which it is not constitutionally entitled.

5

PG&E can still say

It only is possibly losing a subsidy of its speech

Second, each speaker is to determine its own

6

content and TURN'S solicitation messages will not be looked

7

at insofar as they are consistent with the program.

9

Third, TURN'S is required to identify itself as
the source of the message and to indicate that neither PG&E

10

nor the Commission have reviewed the message.

11

effectively means that there will be no confusion and this

12

Court can be sure that if there is confusion the Commission

13

will immediately take steps to rectify that.

14

To that extent, TURN is not free just to s ay

MR. FOGELMAN:

is it may be moved from the subsidized space to the

unsubsidized space.

QUESTION:

MR. FOGELMAN:

I know, but it would cost them money.
And, finally, and this really ties

14

to the program, the giant of access to the ultimate purpose,

the money which TURN receives from its solicitation message

As we indicated earlier, if the California Supreme

QUESTION:

You wouldn't ask us though here to

MR. HARRIS:

MR. HARRIS:

We certainly don't believe it is.

this Court said in Cohen versus California; that it is the

purpose of the First Amendment to remove government from

22

picking and choosing and from deciding who should speak,

23

when they should speak, etc.

24
25

I think it is even more important here, because
here the State of California has at its disposal many other

ways to resolve this problem and it never has to become

If the problem that is bothering California that

4

there is some extra space there where, as it said, it is

5

not recouping the economic value of that space, then let

6

it do what it always does in a rate-making proceeding, assess

7

a value.

8

So, I think that this case clearly comes down

in terms of saying that here is a case where government

really has gotten itself involved in a situation that it
