ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

MS. MC MANUSt

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, this case presents the very delicate
matter of resolving a direct conflict between two very
fundamental values, civil rights and religious
literties.

The question presented is whether the state

13
14

may extend the protections of its civil rights laws to
teachers in religious schools.

15

The state contends the civil rights laws are

16
17
18

properly applied in this setting.

What we are dealing

here with are schools that provide secular education as
well as religious indoctrination.

The schools are

19
20
21

teaching reading, writing, arithmetic, science, history
and geography.
Perhaps the schools are best described in

22

their own

words.

The constitution of Dayton Christian

23
24

Schools provides that the purpose of the institution is
tc provide a program of education in a positive

in compliance with the laws and regulations of the state

The practices —

QUESTION»

Ycur r eference to history as ere of

5

the subjects, do you mean t o suggest to us that
6

religious background has no connection with history,
7

religious belief has nothin g to do with history as it is
8

taught?
9

MS. HC MANUS*

So, certainly we are not

10

suggesting that. Your Honor.

That is part of this

11

country’s histcry, as is — part cf this country’s
12

history is the contribution of people of all sexes and
13

cf all races.

This is part of what is being taught in

*

14

these schools.

Eoth are very important.

15

The practices of these schools,

however,

16

because they are providing secular education, are ret a
17

matter of purely religious concerns.

These schools very

18

much affect a fundamental state interest and are
19

therefore properly subject to state legislation enacted
20

to protect the public order and the general welfare.
21

QUESTION*

Ms. McManus —

22

MS. MC'MANUSi

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

QUESTIONS

— I notice that the Ohio law has a

clause.

Under that prevision, could the Eaytcn

Christian School have obtained prior permission from the
state to hire and retain only those who agreed to held
and observe the particular religious beliefs at issue
here?

available.

9

12

A EFCQ could have been obtained, in

which case we wouldn’t be here.
MS. MC MANUS;

10
11

That provision would —
QUESTION;

8

Yes, that provision would he

we wouldn’t be here.

Is that it?

That doesn’t necessarily mean

They would be able, for example,

to seek a BFOQ that would recognize their right to
discriminate in terms of people -- in terms of hiring

13
14

only persons of their same faith.
A EECC granted on the basis of religion,

15
16
17
18

however, would not necessarily give them an unfettered
right to discriminate as well on the basis cf sex, cr,
as the facts we have in this case, to discriminate ty
taking a retaliatory action against an employee.

19

QUESTION;

20
21

22
23
24

Well,

that is my question, whether

they can get a BFOQ on the basis that they want to hire
and retain only people who agree that if they have young
children they will stay home, or if they have a dispute,
they will take it first to the authorities within the
school.

(202) 628-9300

MS. MC SANOS*

No, Justice O'Conner, I don't

1

believe the BFQQ would be able to extend it that far,
2

because in that situation they wouldn't be seeking an
3

exemption in the narrow sense.

They would be seeking to

4

use the religious exemption in order tc take conduct
5

directly prescribed by state law,
6

QUESTION*

Dees Ohio take the position that it

7

has the right in this particular situation to compel the
8

school to take back on the teaching staff the
9

complaining teacher?
10

MS. MC MANUS*

Justice O'Connor, I think that

11

question is a question we have not yet dealt with.

The

12

situation we have before the Court —
13

QUESTION*

Well, I am asking you as a matter

-

14

of Ohio state law in your view can the Commission
15

require that?
16

MS. MC MANUS*

Yes, the Commission does have

17

the power to order reinstatement.

However, whether or

18

not the Commission would exercise that power in any
19

particular case is a matter of the Commission's
20

discretion.

We simply don't know based upon the record

21

in this case whether that is what the Commission would
22

do.

They do have other remedies available tc them that

23

would affect the purposes of the Act, but that would net
24

include reinstatement, for example, front pay.

QUESTIONS

1

2
3

District Court abstain in this case so that we could
have found out what the Commission would have done?
MS. HC MANUS*

4
5

6
7

Did anyone suggest that the

Yes, Justice Rehnquist, we did

raise the absention argument to the District Court,
particularly on the basis of Younger versus Harris that
they should abstain and let this proceed to hearing.
The District Court in its opinion never addressed the

8
9

absention issue.
QUESTIONS

But it didn’t abstain.

10

MS. MC MANUS*

11

It did not abstain either.

However, what the District Court did, I suppose it comes
12

somewhat close to that, is, it considered the issue to
13
14

be very narrow.

It narrowed the issue only to the

question of whether or not the Commission would be able
15
16
17
18

to proceed to hold a hearing, and expressly reserved
that that was the only issue before it.

However, it

didn’t do that simply cn the basis of abstention.

It

did use the analysis of the constitutional issue.
19

QUESTION*

20

Is it your position that cases of

this Court would support abstention in this case pending
21

22

the conduct of an administrative hearing at the state
level?

23
24

MS. MC MANUSi

Yes, we do believe abstention

would have been a proper remedy for the District Court
25

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

to have followed.

The state courts in Ohio, of course,

1

have the same ability to deal with these constitutional
2

issues.

Had the matter proceeded through the

3
4

administrative hearing, I think we would be in a much
better position, and that we would have a full record.

5

At this point, we

don’t even know if the

6

Commission will find that there was unlawful
7

discrimination, and we can only speculate as to what the
8

Commission might do if they would find it.

This, of

9

course, is a very, very difficult question for the
10

Commission, and

in this area I

think they would proceed

11

in a very sensitive manner.

Any decision they would

12

reach would be reviewed by the state courts.

And I

13

think the advantage of having a full record would have
14

been a very great advantage, dealing with issues of this
15

great importance.
16

There are really two provisions of the Ohio
17

civil rights law that are at issue in this case, and I
18

think it is important to note the distinction.

The

19

first is the statute that makes it unlawful for an
20

employer to discriminate against an employee on the
21

basis of sex.

The second issue that is involved in the

22

case is the Ohio statute that does make it an unlawful
23

employment practice for an employer to retaliate against
24

an employee for having — their statutory rights.
25

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The facts that brought these two issues into
this case I think can be briefly summarized.

Linda

Hoskinson was an elementary school teacher at Dayton
Christian Schools.

She, like every other teacher, was a

born again Christian.
Each year during her employment with the
school she signed a contract in which she affirmed her
belief in the school’s statement of faith.

Also

included in that contract was a place for her to sign
that she did agree with the school's biblical chain of
command.

It is the biblical chain of command that does

interface with the retaliation issue.
The school superintendent explained the
biblical chain of command at the hearing before the
District Court in this way.

He testified in the school

setting the biblical chain of command or the good report
policy means that employees must go only to the school
administrators, and ultimately to the board of directors
for any type of dispute resolution.

They may never take

any concerns or disputes beyond the school's own
authority structure.
QOESTIONa

Ms. McManus, in order for the

Dayton Christian School to qualify under Chic law as a
recognized school for the education of the students for
accreditation purposes, I suppose, the school had to
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

sign some kind of an agreement with the state?
1

MS. MC MANUS*

Yes, the school did have tc

2

submit an application to the state and did receive a
3
4

charter from the state of Ohio.
QUESTIONS

And does the agreement entered into

5

with the state cover in your view an agreement to abide
6

by these procedures of the state with regard to
7

examination of employment discrimination problems?
8

MS. MC MANUS*

The actual procedures for

9

filing a charter I don’t believe specifically cross
10

referenced the civil rights laws, but as a condition for
11

the charter, it would be an agreement with all the
12

regulations enacted by the State Department of
13

Education, and there is a parallel regulation in the
14

State Department of Education’s own rules for regulating
15

chartered schools.
16

I don’t believe, however, there is a direct
17

cross-reference to the civil rights laws.
18

The state is not contending or not questioning
19

that the school’s decision to terminate Mrs. Hoskinson
20

was based upon its sincerely held religious beliefs.
21

The reason the school ultimately fired Mrs.

Hoskinson

22

was because she had gone to see an attorney.

After she

23

had been working at the school for five years, Mrs.
24

Hoskinson became pregnant.
25

10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

When she advised the school administrators of
her pregnancy, they told her they would not renew her
contract for the following year solely for the reason
that her continued teaching would be contrary to the
school’s philosophy concerning the importance of the
mother staying at home with the young children.
Although Mrs. Hoskinson had taught at the
school fcr five years, she had never before heard of
that policy.

After learning that her contract would not

be renewed, Mrs. Hoskinson and her husband consulted an
attorney to find out if that decision was proper.

The

attorney wrote a letter to the school on Mrs.
Hoskinson’s behalf, and as a result of that she was
fired.
The school terminated her contract for what it
stated to be serious philosophical differences.

The

school interpreted her consulting with an attorney in
this matter to be a violation of the school*s biblical
chain of command.

The state is not questioning whether

or not that decision was founded on the school’s
sincerely held religious beliefs, but the state dees
contend that the constitution does not require the state
to accommodate the practice of a religious belief where
to do so would require the state to abdicate its own
compelling interest.
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The point on which both the courts below
1

agreed was that the state did indeed have a compelling
2

interest in

this case.

Both courts found that the state

3

of Ohio does have a compelling interest in eradicating
4

discrimination in employment.

Both courts likewise

5

agreed that the state has a compelling interest in
6

seeking to protect employees who want to question
7

employer practices.
8

QUESTION*

What if this case had arisen in the

9

context of an employment dispute in a church as such
10

instead of a school?
11

MS. MC MANUS*

An employment dispute in a

12

church as the employer, I think it would depend upon
13

perhaps the position we would be talking about, whether 14

the church is employing a gardner or a secretary.

If

15

you are talking about a situation where the church is
16

employing the priest or the spiritual ministers, there,
17

no, the Act would not apply in that instance.
18

QUESTION.:

Is there an express exclusion?

19

MS. MC MANUS*

No, the Ohio statute does not

20

have an express exclusion for religious institutions.
21

QUESTION*

And so why do you say it does not

22

apply in that situation?
23

MS. MC MANUS*

I believe in the situation

24

where you are talking about the church as an employer

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

and an ecclesiastical position, a religious position, in
that situation I think the Constitution would protect
that decision.
QUESTION*

4
5

Constitution, the free exercise clause?
MS. KC MANUS*

6
7

And what provision of the

Honor.

The First Amendment.

Yes, Your

I think under the line of cases, however, it has

never gone beyond that point.

I think the Court has

8
9
10
11
12

made clear that churches do have a right to
self-governments in the area of purely ecclestiastical
matters.

However, that line of cases has never been

extended this far where we are talking about a situation
there there is a very definite secular state interest as

13
14

well.
QUESTIONS

Ms. McManus, supposing that instead

15
16
17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24

of an antidiscrimination statute this were a state wages
and hours statute, which came up under the same
circumstances.

In other words, the school says it is

our policy to pay people only, it is part of our
religion to pay people only ten cents an hour, and that
is a religious belief, no one questions the sincerity.
«

Any different result, in your view?
MS. NC MANUS*

I think you would have to go

through the same balancing analysis to determine —
QUESTION*

You say this is a compelling -- hew

25

13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

do you tell a compelling state interest when you say
1

that?
2

MS. MC MANUSi

In one way, we look at the

3

decisions of this Court.

I think that —

4

QUESTION*

Hew does this Court tell?

5

MS. MC MANUSi

By looking at the importance of

6

that to what the state is attempting to achieve.
7

QUESTION!

How does the Court know how

8

important it is what the state is attempting to
9

achieve?
10

MS. MC MANUSi

Kell, in part it is what the

11

state is saying.

It is also a situation here where you

12

are — the state is acting to protect the personal
13

rights of Mrs. Hoskinson and other teachers.

We have inr

14

support of this a long history —
15

QUESTION*

How is it any different from a

16

wages and hours claim?
17

MS. MC MANUS*

It may not be.

Wages and hours

18

may well be also a compelling state interest.
19

QUESTION*

And it would just depend on whether

20

a particular court said whether or not it was a
21

compelling state interest?
22

MS. MC MANUSi

Well, and on the record that

23

had been developed for it.

Here we have a situation

24

where Congress and the Court has recognized that we have
25

14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

a strong history of trying to eliminate discrimination
against women that parallels —
QUESTION*

3
4

to raise wages and hours, too.
MS. MC MANUS*

5

6
7

We have a strong history of trying

Behnquist.

Yes, there may well be, Justice.

And that, too, may also be a compelling

state interest that would be applicable in the setting
because of the nature cf the setting.

8

In a situation where you do have a compelling

9
10
11
12

state interest, then an exception or an accommodation is
not required unless that state's interest can otherwise
be served.

Another way to state the test is that, as

this Court has stated in United States versus lee,
13
14
15
16
17
18
19

20

whether or not the burden on the practice of the
religios belief is essential to accomplish the
overriding governmental interest.
Here, I believe,

is where the Court of Appeals

most seriously erred in its holding that the state’s
interest could otherwise be accommodated.

The Court of

Appeals believed that granting an exception to Dayton
Christian School would not seriously interfere with the

21

22
23
24

state’s interest.

The sole reason it gave for this

conclusion was that the state would still be able to
regulat the employaant practices of non-religious
institutions and of religious institutions except where

25
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

religious belief is implica-ted.
1

I think, the flaw in the Court’s reasoning is
2

apparent.

The limits it believed it was placing on its

3

decision are simply illusory when you look at the
4

context of this case.

As a very practical matter, the

5

state will have no ability to learn of discriminatory
6

\

practices in the religious schools if an employee cannot
7

safely come and question a discriminatory practice.
8

QUESTION*

But of course you have conceded

9

that within the church employment context that may well
10

be the case, and that the free exercise clause would
11

have the effect of keeping the state out of the
12

picture.
13

MS. MC MANUS;

It may, in the church case

14

where we are talking purely —
15

QUESTION;

That is precisely the allegation

16

being made here, that teaching of young students is such
17

an integral part of conveying the religious values held
18

by this particular faith that it comes closer to the
19

church context, so how do you respond to that?
20

MS. MC MANUS;

I do believe that is the

21

school's argument.

They are attempting to say they are

22

entitled to the same exemption that would have to be
23

given to a church, and I think the fact that makes this
24

an entirely different case is the fact that cannot be

Yes, but isn't that really your

NS. KC NANUS*

He believe the practice cf

seriously interferes.

recognized —

Hell, then you want to just

18

You want to say, you cannot do that.

You are not prepared to do that, are you?
MS. MC MANUSs

No, because I don't think that

19
20

would achieve the state's interest.

The state's

interest here is in protecting the employees.

We have a

21

22

compelling interest in seeing that the employees
themselves receive the benefit of the act.

MS. MC MANUS*

He are questioning it only tc

sexually discriminatory or discriminatory on the basis

Act.

He don’t question their right to send the children

This situation, however, is not a situation

from the Commission whether or not that was unlawful
discrimination, but -QUESTION!

Well, did the — go ahead.

HS. MC MANUS*

I think that the point that is

different in this situation where we are talking, we are
not trying to interfere with the school’s right to have
these beliefs or with the school's right to teach,
19

but

where the processes, whether administrative employment
1

practices take the form of discrimination, we do believe
2

in this setting tha state —
3

QUESTION*

But the school says that is an

4

element of our faith,

in a way, and you say they are

5

entitled to have only people of the faith teaching, and
6

yet one of the elements of their faith is that they will
7

not go outside the biblical command.

It seems to me

8

that you are in a bit of a contradiction there.
9

MS. MC MANUS*

Maybe it should be qualified

10

and I misspoke in this sense, to the extent we are
11

talking about religious beliefs that are inherently
12

sexually discriminatory or retaliatory or would be used
13

in a manner that would be contrary to state law, it is
14

the state’s position that the practice of these beliefs
15

may be limited because of the state’s compelling
16

interest.
17

QUESTION*

So then the church -- a religious

18

school cannot insist that only people of its own faith
19

be employed.
20

MS. MC MANUS*

Not if it also implicates one

21

of the other provisions of the Act.

Yes, that is our

22

position.
23

QUESTION*

Hell, one of the provisions of the

24

Act I suppose is that you don’t discriminate on the

MS. MC MANUS*

That is one of the provisions

2
3
4

of the Act.

However,

in that situation where it is

strictly religious discrimination, the preference to
hire only those of your faith, the state does

5

accommodate.
QUESTIONS

7

Well, I know, but as Justice

Behnguist says, one of the articles of faith is staying
8
9

home with your kids, and another is following the chain
of command, and yet you think they must keep teachers cn

10
11

who refuse to abide by those two tenets.
MS. MC MANUS:

It is the state's position, no,

12

that the Act would apply in that situation.
13

QUESTION:

14

So it is.

They must keep teachers -

on even though they do not share the faith of the
15

church.
16

MS. MC MANUS:

17
18

Yes, and we believe that burden

on the practice of those religious beliefs is a
permissible one under the Constitution.

QUESTION:

20

Tell me, suppose the argument

between this teacher and the school was just a

22

they didn't think that she was performing correctly, or
23

some other reason, and she said, I think you are

MS. MC MANUS*

We have no problem in that

QUESTION*

Why?

4

MS. MC MANUS*

There is no state interest.

That firing is —

She wants to sue the church for breaching its

MS. MC MANUS*

But the state would not come in

10

and act.

I mean, she wouli still have access to the

11

state court,

certainly.

12

QUESTION*

Could she win or not?

13

MS. KC MANUS*

That would be — could she win -

14

but for the basis of —
15

QUESTION*

Well, the church's defense is,

16

look., this is an article of faith.

This is an article

17

of faith.

You have consulted an attorney, contrary to

18

our church doctrine.
19

MS. MC MANUS*

That may go in terms of the

20

tenor of the parties or the binding nature of the
21

contract.

I don't think that would deny the person the

you.

Let me try another hypothetical on

Suppose with this religious sponsored school they

dismissed the teacher because she had an illegitimate
8
9
10

baby.

Do you think that would be a violation of her

civil rights?

MS. MC MANUS*

11
12

Is that discrimination?
If the policy was phrased in

that way, it may well be sexually discriminatory.

If

the school on the other hand had a moral code under
13
14
15
16
17
18

which they would dismiss a person, man or woman, for
what they believed was immoral conduct, then it may net
well be sex discrimination at all.

It's the policy

that's phrased in the sexually discriminatory manner
that is contrary to state law.

He have no disagreement

with the general moral codes that would be evenhandedly
19
20

applied.
QUESTION*

Would you say that a teacher in the

21

22
23
24

public schools could be dismissed on the same ground?
MS. MC MANUSi

Probably not.

I think there

would be a different standard in the public schools.
QUESTION*

So you concede there is a different

25

23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

standard in the religious sponsored church.
1

MS. MC MANUS*

But there there is not the same

2

degree of state action that would bring in the other
3

protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.

We do believe,

4

however, that the protections of the Act are properly

>

5

applied in this setting, and I think we are dealing here
6

with a situation where we have discrimination in the
7

education setting heightens the state’s interest in this
8

matter.
9

This Court in a number of cases has recognized
10

that discrimination particularly in the educational
11

setting does not have constitutional protection.

It was

12

recognized in Norwood versus Harrison, where the Court
13

held the state could not constitutionally aid private
14

schools that practiced race discrimination.

It was held

15

in Bunyan versus McCrary, where the Court held that the
16

right to prohibit the practice of race discrimination in
17

private schools could survive a challenge based upon the
18

parents* First Amendment freedom of association rights.
19

And most recently in Bob Jones University the Court held
20

that the Constitution does not give affirmative
21

protection to discrimination in the educational setting.
22

In this setting, because we are dealing with a
23

situation where it is not purely religious, we don’t
24

question the parents’ rights to have the alternative of

these schools.

The state supports these schools in

their right to flourish.

However, it has always been

recognized as a necessary corollary of that right that
they would be subject to reasonable state regulation,
and the sta,te civil rights laws regulating the

5

6
7

employment decisions we feel is a reasonable state
regulation.

It is also an area, an interest that cannct

otherwise be served.

The state's interest is in

8
9

protecting Hrs. Hosklnson and ether teachers.
There has never been suggested any alternative

10
11

by which the state could achieve these objectives and
not have the Act applied in this instance.

The fact

12

that the exemption that may be carved out is a limited
13
14

exemption has never been a basis for saying that the
state must accommodate.

For example, in United States

15

versus Lee, the Court did not hold that the Amish
16
17
18

employers were entitled to an exemption from the Social
Security law simply because there were only a few Amish
farmers.

The Court held that the Act could be applied

19

20

even though it required conduct directly contrary to
their religious belief, because the state's, the

21

22

government's interest in social security was so
compelling.

We feel in this instance the state's

23
24

interest in the eradication of discrimination and in the
protection of employees who

seek to assert their civil

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BENTLEY BALL, ESQ.,
5

OH BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES
6

MR. BALL;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

7

please the Court, I should like to touch upon
8

jurisdiction just for a moment, because the question of
9

Younger absention has been raised.

The facts of the

10

case were that the state initially did raise a question
11

of abstention, and then it gave up its point.

It

12

consented to federal jurisdiction.

This appears very

13

clearly in this record.
14

QUESTION;

There is federal jurisdiction when

15

a court abstains.
16

MR. BALL;

I beg your pardon. Your Honor.

QUESTION;

I said

17

there remains federal

18

jurisdiction when a court abstains.
19

HR. BALL;

Yes, that's correct, Ycur Honor. I

20

am only saying that what the state did was consent to
21

place itself

under the jurisdiction of the court, and

22

under United States versus — the Hodory case, rather,
23

Ohio versus Hodory, where the state, this Court has
24

held,

where the state voluntarily surrenders to the

jurisdiction of the federal court the principle of
comity doesn’t require federal court jurisdiction —
QUESTIONS
we can find

that?

MR. BALL*
you now.

Is there some place in the record

Yes, there is.

I will give it to

It is in the joint appendix. Justice

Rehnquist, at Page 127.

The pretrial order of the

federal court notes the jurisdiction of this Court is
not disputed.
QUESTION*

Of course, that says nothing tc me

about abstention.
MR. BALL*

All we can say is that this case

has now been five years in the courts, in two federal
courts, up to here, and in all cf these cases the
jurisdiction of tha court has been assumed, and the
state has insisted upon jurisdiction.

In its

jurisdictional statement it told the court that it
believed there was no jurisdictional problem.
QUESTION*

But your typical abstention case,

as I understand it, Mr. Ball, is that the jurisdiction
of the federal court is conceded.

The case stays cn the

docket of the District Court, and the proceedings are
run through the state courts to solve all the state law
questions.

Then the party is entitled to come back, and

adjudicate their federal right in the federal court.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. BALL*

We could not have even begun, we

1

could not have proceeded in the state courts at all
2

because cf the fact that the Ohio Civil Rights Act was
3

absolutely preclusive of permitting us to have raised
4

any religious liberty objection at the very outset.

At

5

the beginning we were closed out by the effect of the
6

statute.

The statute does not allow any religious

7

defenses whatever.
8

QUESTION*

Yes, but as a matter of practice,

9

is it net true that in Ohio the Commission has granted a
10

number of exemptions and has recognized in the process
11

of some of these very sensitive cases that it shouldn’t
12

interevene?

Wouldn't you concede that?

13

MR. BALLt

This is based, I think. Justice

14

O'Connor, what you are saying is based on
15

representations made in the raply brief, which is the
16

first time —

MR. BALLs

Up against a constitutional

21

22

problem, yes.
QUESTIONS

Hell, don't you think the Ohio

23
24

courts might have looked at it that way, too?
MR. BALLs

We couldn't have gotten there.

25
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The

problem there. Justice Rehnquist, is that we couldn't
1

have gotten into court with any record of the religious
2

-- any evidence in the administrative proceedings of our
3

religious problem.

The Mobil versus Rocky River case,

4

which we cited, rules out any consideration of
5

constitutional issues by the Ohio Civil Rights
6

Commission.
7

So, we couldn't place anything in evidence in
8

the administrative proceedings, but when we got to the
9

court level there are further provisions under the Chio
10

Civil Rights Act that are again preclusive, but the only
11

thing the court upon an appeal, the Court of Common
12

Pleas upon an appeal from the Ohio Civil Rights
13

Commission can go on is whether the evidence was
14

probative and substantial, and with that, there being no
15

religious issue possible to be raised, we were closed
16

cut.
17

There is absolutely no record of any lenience
18

or any meets and bounds and clear standards of lenience
19

which the Commission is given by the statute, and the
20

Dayton Christian Schools have not sought some kind of a
21

break under the law.

They don’t want to corrupt

22

bargain.

The Act itself simply says that it is unlawful

23

for any employer to discharge any person on account of
24

that person’s race,

religion, et cetera, et cetera,

25
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

without just cause.
Now, the just cause wording of this statute

2
3
4

does net give any allowance to the raising cf religious
issues because the Ohio Supreme Court in the Plumbers
and Steamfitters Committee case held definitively, as in

5
6
7

other cases, that just cause is never an issue where
discrimination is charged.

So this Dayton Christian

Schools has indeed under the terms of the statute
8
9

committed an act of religious discrimination.
QUESTION*

Well, the counsel or the state who

10
11

is here concedes that in some circumstances the state
would not attempt to apply the statute, and would

12

recognize a free exercise claim.

Unfortunately, the

13
14

case comes to us in a posture of not knowing whether the
state would dc so in this circumstance.

15

MB. BALL*

At the outset, when the charge was

16
17

first brought, it was the position of Dayton Christian
Schools that the Act as applied to this school would

18

absolutely find the necessary application of the Act
19

would result in this school’s conduct being considered
20

unlawf ul.
21

The state at that point, not at the reply
22

brief stage, at the end of this case before the Supreme
23
24

Court, at that point makes no mention of an liberality.
Its very point, and we heard it argued here today, is

25
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

that if you discriminate on account of sex, you can have
1

no religious justification whatever, so therefore it was
2

perfectly futile for Dayton Christian Schools to attempt
3

to proceed through the administrative proceedings.
4

It was clear to us that the Act did find us
5

guilty at the outset since no religious defense could
6

conceivably be raised under the terms of the statute.

There is no

This is a very clear statute that

says these acts of discrimination are unlawful, and that
to discharge a person under these circumstances was
unlawful.

Now, had the Commission at that stage felt

that it had some legal power, which it does not,

to come

to us and say, we would like to consider this business
8
9
10
11
12

of this unlawful discharge, and we might because of
religious reasons relieve you of any burden.

The

state’s attorney general has told this Court this very
hour that this could never be done.

The Commission, I

think, is being spoken for when it said here that
13
14
15

absolutely there cannot be any religious justification
for what the Commission calls sex discrimination.

So I

think we are in a classic case of futility.

still couldn’t use one word, one item cf that evidence

here just a few minutes ago.
5

SB. BALL*

I would certainly agree with you,

6

Mr. Chief Justice.

At any rate, the Court has before it

7

an entirely religious, classically religious
8

non-state-aided religious entity which would not exist
9

except to carry out its religious mission to children.
10

I fully agree with the sense of questions which were
11

asked of opposing counsel moments ago concerning the
12

religious nature of the institution.

Cf course, they

13

are subject to state regulation.

But that no more

14

converts them into a secular institution than any
15

regulation could.
16

They are very much like the schools in Lemon

Christian Schools, if a situation of that kind arose
where a teacher in the school noticed a situation of
child abuse, she would then follow the scriptural chain
of command.

She would go to the person, first of all,

and say, is this really true.

would move

it into the larger faith community to have reported it
there, and conceivably soon.
QUESTION*

And if instead the state law —

MR. BALL*

Then the school would report it.

QUESTION*

— required her not to do that, but

to report it first to the state authority, that could
not be followed in your view?

The state couldn't

require that of her?
MR. BALL*

That's correct.

However, however,

Thank you. Your Honor.

I think there are three questions that have to

First of all, may the state bar Dayton

Christian Schools from observance of its doctrines
regarding mothers, the role of the mother in relation to

5
the infant, and with respect to I Corinthians and
6

Matthew 18, and more broadly, is government free to
7

impose, contrary to the First Amendment, requirements
8

upon a religious school such as this which would forbid
9

it to differentiate sexually and forbid it to choose
10

those who are going to be carrying out its ministry?
11

And finally, we have to examine the question
12

here of the statute in question which precludes the
13

raising of any constitutional defenses under the
14

religion clauses.

The court has said in Serbian that it

15

is of the essence of these religious unions and of
16

religious faith that religious decisions of the body are
17

to be accepted as matters of faith, which may not be
18

conformable to secular notions, may not be conformable
19

to secular notions of fundamental fairness or
20

impermissible objectives.
21

You have a statute here which is very unlike
22

Title 7, wherein it would be possible to have raised
23

religious defenses.

We could go into that at quite seme

24

length, but clearly if we were under a Title 7 type

Does that matter in our balancing of the free

HH. BALLs

I think it doesn’t, first of all,

12

impart secularity to the school.

This is a pervasively

13
14

religious institution, so it is like the schools that
are considered in cases such as Lemon, Catholic Bishop,

15
16
17
18

and so on.

Then as to the commitment —

just wonder whether it matters at all that the state has
given a charter to qualify the school to graduate

19

20

students that meat state requirements.
HE. BALL*

I think not.

Again, this school

21

22

constitutionally speaking is precisely in the slot of
the schools which were considered in Catholic Bishop.

23

I

And they are state regulated schools.

In Pennsylvania,

Kurtzman, and so on.
1

But in addition to that is the fact that
2

certainly the school by signing an agreement under its
3

charter to be conformable to state laws, which it would
4

be anyhow, certainly wasn’t making a commitment to abide
5

by any unconstitutional law which would be imposed upon
6

the school, for example, a law which says that you may
7

not follow your mother doctrine, or follow your doctrine
8

with respect to going to the law, taking a believer to
9

the outside.
10

It certainly is true that great harm will be
11

visited upon the school if it is made to come under the
12

jurisdiction of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission.

It

13

will cause a religious body to have to cease and desist .
14

from observing a traditional, very central doctrine
15

voluntarily embraced by its members.

It makes the

16

religious group an active agent in breach of its own
17

doctrine, even causing it to — the state having power
18

to make it take back someone who is unfaithful to its
19

doctrine, and to pay for that.
20

Not only does it sanction the role of the
21

state as an actor in supporting of dissidence, which is
22

a marked feature of this case, and to take sides in what
23

is a religious controversy, but it would also support
24

the bad example before the parents and the children of

situations, decisions in courts in which it has been
recognized that there may be a right of privacy which
requires that a nursing home for old women, for example,

13
14

would hire only women, and certainly we have as much
involved here from a constitutional point of view, an

15
16
17
18

interest involved here of religious liberty which would
seem equal at least to that right of privacy.
I think the Court is being asked to say that
it will rule as follows.

that if it is sex discrimination, there can be no break,
2

and the second thing that can be done is, the Court to

uphold the position on the merits of the Ohio Civil
Rights Commission and thus say that the teaching and the

practice, the practice of this religious body with

respect to the role of the mother shall be suppressed,

and that likewise shall be suppressed.

How would

you distinguish this from

preliminary before bringing any litigation or an
agreement to have final and binding arbitration,
foregoing all resort to the courts?
MS. MC MANUSi

10
11

Very briefly.

I think that in this area of

the civil rights law would be an impermissible and
unbinding type of agreement if it would constitute a
prospective waiver of the civil rights that the state

13
14

has affirmatively conferred on these people.

A

prior

agreement cannot constitute a valid waiver of statutory
15
16
17
18
19
20
21

22
23
24
25

rights.

I think that also would very much affect the

state’s interest, because here the state’s interest is
dependent upon having people who are willing to come
forward and ask questions and to assert their rights
seriously interfere with the fulfillment of the state’s
interest in this case.
I would like to point out in partial response
to Justice Steven’s question that I think it is true
that the issue we are dealing with here is not limited
just to the civil rights area, particularly with respect
49

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

to the biblical chain of command policy which the school
1

recognizes is prevalent among many religions.

If such

2

poolicies can effectively shroud the institution from
3

the application of any secular law they feel to be
4

onerous or burdensoma, I think there is a real risk that
5

there will be other institutions who will seek to claim
6

similar exemptions regardless of whether or not it is
7

based upon genuinely held religious belief.
8

I think in a situation like this, if the civil
9

rights law which was found by both courts below to be a
10

compelling state interest, and whose findings are
11

supported by this Court’s holding in Roberts versus
12

United States Jaycees, that the civil rights law is not
13

a sufficiently compelling interest to permit the state
14

to protect an employee who merely seeks to ask a
15

question, I think it is very unlikely any law ever will
16

be able to prevail in this instance.
