to customs people to just settle these cases?

what it boils down to, they have settlement authority,

Is that

QUESTION*

Is there a difference between

litigation and remission?
MR. HOROWITZ*

I would say no.

I’m using the

22

term ’’remission” to cover both.

Generally remission, I

23

think, may refer to remission of the entire forfeiture.

So, mitigation is not less than?
I think mitigation can also

MR. hCROWITZ:

13

There's no question that the

14

government could have forfeited the Jagaar, and in fact

15

the Ninth Circuit itself held that the Jaguar was

16

forfeitable.

asking for the entire $24,500 is because Customs had

QUESTION*

Well, this is the predicate --

9

HR. HOROWITZ*

Let me just say, it's not a

10

typical act of generosity on behalf of the Customs

11

S ervice.

12

QUESTION*

Is the predicate for a petition for

13

remission that there’s been a fine or a penalty imposed,

14

or that a forfeiture has occurred?

15
16

HR. HOROWITZ*

Well, the assumption of the

remission petition is that the property was forfeitable.

17

QUESTION*

Isn’t that what 1618 says?

18

HR. HOROWITZ*

19

QUESTION*

20

HR. HOROWITZ*

Yes, 1618 —

You have to -— provides for that.

The

21

claimant doesn’t have to concede forfeitability in

filing this remission petition.

11

QUESTION*

I guess

He can raise the claim

He files a petition for remission,

or whatever you want to call it, and he says, please
remit because my car wasn't forfeitable?
MR. HOROWITZ*

Yes.

But in raising that

12

claim, he is entitled to due process, which I think

13

entitles him to some sort of a judicial hearing.

14

QUESTION*

So, he may raise it?

15

MR. HOROWITZ*

He may raise it, but wher

16

Customs acts on a remission petition it usually is not

17

with a full panoply of due process protections that are

18

associated with a judicial hearing.

19

So, I would say if customs rejects remission

20

petition because it has rejected his claim that the car

21

is not forfeitable, that is not dispositive.

22

still entitled to a judicial hearing.

23

QUESTION*

He is

Are you saying that he is entitled

24

to some sort of a due process protection if he raises

(202) 628 9300

1

or are you saying he is entitled to due process

2

protection if he seeks a judicial determination?

3

HR. HOROWITZ;

What I am saying is that at the

4

time his property is seized he is entitled to a judicial

5

determination of forfeitability at some point, if the

6

government is going to forfeit it.

7

that by filing remission petition, or even if as part of

8

his remission petition he claims that it was not

9

forfeitable at all but he has waived the right —
QUESTION;

10

And I don't believe

Well, anyway. Hr. Horowitz, there

11

is no forfeitability procedure except in the District

12

Court, is there?

Is that right?

MR. HOROWITZ;

13

done administratively.

14

QUESTION;

15

But let's take a larger one, like

this one.

Well, this was $24,500, and —

Well, $24,000 --

MR. HOROWITZ;

Well, today, actually the limit

is $100,000, so this could be administratively —
QUESTION;

Whatever it may be, if there is to

24

be a judicial proceeding, doesn't the government have to

25

initiate it?
1 1
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. HOROWITZ

The Government has to initiate

2

it, although the Claimant —

3

QUESTION*

So, if there is a remission

4

proceeding, it *s denied, then the government has to go

5

in if the government says it’s forfeitable, and go in

6

and initiate a proceeding in some court, doesn't it?
MR. HCROWITZi

7

That's correct.

The Claimant

8

can file an equitable action to get the government to

9

initiate the forfeiture proceeding, but that's right.

10

In order to ultimately forfeit the property the

11

government mtist initiate a judicial proceeding.
QUESTION*

12

And this is in response to due

13

process considerations?

14

HR. HCP.OWITZ*

15

I believe so.

It satisfies due

process.
QUESTION*

16

It's in response to a statute,

17

isn't it, that the government initiates a procedure, is

18

that just kind of a constitutional —
MR. HOROWITZi

19

No,

there's a statrte that does

20

it.

I understood Justice Brennan to be suggesting that

21

if there were no such steps that there might be due

22

process problems, and I would agree with that, that if

23

the government's going to take property that at one time

24

belonged to a private citizen and take it for itself and

25

forfeit it at seme point, he has a right to be heard.

QUESTION*

Does this record show what facts

2

were alleged to lead the Customs Ser/ice to exercise

3

this compassionate aathority?

4

KB. HOROWITZs

As far as I know, there’s

5

nothing in the administrative file that — in the record

6

that reflects why the administrative decision was made.

7

QUESTIONS

Isn’t it pretty clear that this

8

record shows that from the outset, he’s embarked on a

9

scheme to defraud the government?

10

MB. HOROWITZs

11
12

Well, it’s not clear whether he

had an intention to defraud it.
QUESTIONS

Well —

Well, isn’t there a statement from

13

him in writing that he was about to give this to his

girlfriend ?

QUESTION*

18

MR. HOROWITZs

Well, he says that he bought it

I don’t know what that has to

do with why he was bringing it into the country without

20

paying customs duty.

21
22
23

QUESTION*

Well, I thought the question was,

did he make any statement at all, and you said none.
MR. HOROWITZ*

No, he made a statement in his

24

remission petition that he did not intend to violate

25

customs duty.

He had some story about how he had got

lost looking for tha Canadian customs station, and

2

stumbled onto the U.S. customs station and had no idea

3

what was happening.

4

I guess I should say that — finally, in his

5

supplemental petition, that he first made the claim that

6

he hadn’t really been given an opportunity to declare.
QUESTION*

7

Hell, it seems to me if a person

8

makes a return and has a number of purchases and he

9

forgets to list or declare a scarf or some such thing,

10

but a $24,000 Jaguar is a little hard to forget, isn’t

11

it?

12

MR. HOROWITZ*

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, I

13

understand you to be asking a question along the same

14

lines cs Justice Powell, that you don’t understand why

15

the Agfncy would send him a check for $21,000, and I

16

understand why you are asking

17

that.

I will just say that they do have guidelines

18

on these things and this is not completely beyond the

19

normax reach of the guidelines.

5

HR. HOROWITZ;

QUESTION;

7

— or he wouldn't have given them

$24,000 —
MR. HOROWITZ;

8
9

I'm not — I don't --

Well, the guidelines tend to go

to first offense and things like that.

Generally in the

10

case of a first offense they — the penalty is somewhat

11

less than — the duty in this case, I'm not sure exactly

12

what the amount is, but it would have been something

13

less than $1,000, so I think Customs has the view that

14

for somebody to pay 25 times the duty is perhaps a

15

little bit harsh.
QUESTION;

16
17

And what they got was about three

times the normal?
HR. HOROWITZ;

18

About, yes, maybe four or

19

five.

20

should have or not, and they decided the penalty would

21

be 33,600.

22

after he filed an unsuccessful administrative appeal

challenging the institution of the $3,600 penalty.

24
25

Well, so Customs did grant remission whether they

They sent Respondent a check for $20,900

He said, thank you very much.

He deposited

his remission of $21,000, and then he filed this lawsuit

(202) 628-9300

1

in District Court seeking to recover from the government

2

the Ef3,6G0 that he had not been repaid.
Nov, cn the first appeal in this case, the

3
4

Court of Appeals held that he was entitled to recover.

5

The basis for that decision vas that the passage of time

6

of 36 days from the time of his initial remission

7

petition until the time the Customs Service acted on it

8

violated his due process rights, and the Court added

9

that the Constitution ordinarily required such petitions

10

be ruled upon within 24 hours.
That decision

11

was subsequently vacated by this

12

Court and remanded for reconsideration in light of

13

8850.

14

prior decision that the delay here raised serious due

15

process problems, although it retreated somewhat from

16

its 24-hour rule and agreed that each case must be

17

considered on its own facts.

18

On remand the Court of Appeals adhered to its

It is our contention that the Court cf Appeals

19

erred in several respects.

First and foremost, we

20

submit that there is no constitutionally protected

21

property interests at stake in the remission stage, and

22

hence there to which due process rights can attach.

23

Second, even if there is such a right, we

24

submit that the course of events here could not

25

conceivably have violated due process, and third, even
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

if it did violate due process, we would contend that the

2

remedy here, which is returning the $3,600 to him,

3

basically eliminating the forfeiture, is quite

4

inappropriate.
The primary question here, the one cn which I

5

6

will focus, is do the protections of the due process

7

clause which apply to deprivations of life, liberty or

8

property attach to the remission procedure.

9

of putting the question is, does the remission procedure

Another way

10

here — that is, does an adverse decision to the

11

Claimant in the remission proceeding deprive him of any

12

property interest.
We submit that the answer is clearly no.

13

Of

14

course, there is no question that the Respondent does

15

have a property interest in this car at the time it was

16

seized.

17

without a judicial hearing.

18

gives him due process with respect to that property

19

interest.

20

That property interest cannot be taken away

QUESTION*

Well, Mr. Horowitz, it seems as

though you reach exactly the same result if you

10

acknowledge that there is a property interest in the car

11

and it is subject to due process protections, but the

12

forfeiture proceeding itself provides all the process

13

that’s due.

14
15
16

MR. HOROWITZ*

Well, that is our position.

Justice O’Coniior.
Our position is that there is no due process

17

right in the remission proceeding itself.

18

could repeal the remission procedure tomorrow and there

19

would be no question that the forfeiture, general

20

forfeiture procedure would still satisfy due process.

21

Congress

I think maybe the best way to look at this

22

problem is to assume that Customs had set up the

23

remission procedure a little bit differently.

24

explained, the remission proceedings come first the way

25

it is set up now, and that is done to avoid litigation,

As we've

but Customs could just as easily have said that the

2

forfeiture proceeding will be held first, and let's

3

assume that the held a forfeiture hearing the day after

4

Respondent's car was seized and the car was held to be

5

forfeitable, and then Customs said, now that your car

6

has been held forfeitable you can file a remission

7

petition and we’ll decide whether we're going to remit

8

some of the forefeiture.
In that situation there can't be any

9
10

conceivable argument that there's a property interest,

11

or that any due process right would attach to the

12

remission petition.

13

It's been adjudicated to be the government's property in

14

a judicial proceeding.
QUESTION*

15

It is the government's property.

Then the only question is, that's

16

the very point, that that's not what the government

17

does, that they haven't set up something where they have

18

this procedure after the legal determination has been

made .

20

At the time this takes place, he still does

21

have a property interest in either the bond or the car,

22

doesn't he?

23

MR. HOROWITZ*

He has a property interest in

24

the car, but it's not implicated at all in the remission

It is

1

the limbo, if I may. Your Honor, it is conceding that

2

there is no right to a particular determination.

3

the fact that the man whose property is seized with no

4

hearing, that is the basic, fundamental stretching of

5

the Constitution to the limit.

It is

6

The property is gone because a law enforcement

7

officer thinks that there’s grounds for a violation, but

8

there's been no hearing, no probable cause, no

determination.

So, the worse the defense is, makes no

QUESTION:

Well, when the Government has

7

seized, whether it’s diamonds or Jaguar automobiles, is

8

not the — they have seized it and are holding

9

possession of it, does not the individual have a right

10

to bring a Klevin action?
MR. BIFKE:

11

Well, as I indicated in response

12

to a previous question, he is — he may have a right, if

13

he consults a lawyer who looks at 8850 -- of course it

14

wasn’t clear then, that was ten years ago, but he might

15

be able to bring a Klevin action.
But the point, respectfully, Your Honor, is

16
17

that it is the Government’s duty and obligation to bring

18

the forfeiture proceeding.

19

fact, it’s codified that they have to act with

20

reasonable promptness and as a matter of fact, 1603

21

provides that the customs people have to refer with

22

reasonable promptness to the U.S. Attorney, and once the

23

judicial proceeding is instituted there cannot be any

24

administrative consideration of the petition for

25

remission.

And now, as a matter of

So, I submit to Tour Honor that the emphasis,

1

2

or the key point here is the fact that you are dealing

3

with what I call the tipping of the scale or the

4

stretching of the seizure right to the very limit of the

5

Constitution, that it is — I believe Justice Brennan

6

pointed this out to counsel, it is the Government's duty

7

to go forward.
We have already said to the Government, we are

8
9

going to give you the greatest rights you can possibly

10

have.

11

the very end of the spectrum of constitutional — you

12

can take the property because it's a customs law.

13

It's an extraordinary situation here.

are the limits that the Government will employ in going

17

ahead with a forfeiture, and we recognize in 8850 that

there is a property interest to be protected, and I just

have difficulty understanding how there should be an

additional concern about timeliness of the remission.

takes care of this.

There's a statute an the books, and I would

2

think this, Your Honor.

I would say that, because you

3

didn't reach this in 8850, but were there not a

4

remission practice, and I think that there might very

5

well be imposed a constitutional standard of a prompt

6

probable cause hearing.

mean, you have never had to address that point but if

8

you are sitting in a situation where the man's property

is seized without hearing, I don't think that the same

I

10

standards which you laid down in 8850, you would perhaps

11

lay down in the absence of a remission because that was

12

one of the prime factors, or a factor that you discussed

13

in 8850, was that the government had to have time to

14

process the petition for remission.

15

That is one of the factors.

If you did not

16

have a petition for remission, I believe there would be

17

a very serious guestion as to whether or not the

Government wouldn't be required within 24 hours or 36

I say

1

first of all, the Court must establish that there is no

loss of property interest upon seizure, which the

Government concedes.

What is that?

Did the Court of

Appeals have some specific period in mind?
MR. BIRKEs

No, they left it to the — I think

13

that there should be a 30-day rule for this reason, it's

14

kind of — one thing, it wins the case for me which is

15

of course the most important,

16

45 or 60, there ought to be something because we're

17

talking about conduct of the administrative agency, how

18

they're going to act in the future, ahd the lack of

19

certainty has been raised and some questions about

20

whether the Government officials know.

but whet ler it took 30 or

21

So, I think they should be told by this Court

22

-- you should have, that there is a presumption that 30

23

days is enough and then —

24
25

QUESTION;

When did the Court of Appeals think

a presumption arose?

HR. BIRKE;

QUESTION*

3

ME. BIRKEs

They said they left it to —
Five days?
No, they did not say anything

4

specific.

5

Court decides whether the length of delay is

6

prejudicial, they should take into account that vehicles

7

are very, very important in the general case to a

8

person, his mobility, his livelihood.

The Court of Appeals said, when the District

And they sail, when you're dealing with a

9
10

vehicle — this was at the conclusion of the opinion —

11

you have to recognize that a 30-day delay -- I think

12

they were inferring, and I think they should have just

13

decided as a matter of law instead of referring it tc

14

the District Court because I think as counsel does, they

15

practically told the District Court what to dc here and

16

I think

they should have done it.

17

I think that they're saying that this Court

18

should say something like 30 days is sufficient where

19

you have a vehicle which can be in the general sense an

20

extremely important thing, and unless you can justify

21

more.

And that's tha third point which is your own

22

test.

The Government should have to justify if they’re

23

going to take longer than 30 days, especially when they

24

go on the assumption that he's guilty anyway, which is

25

not the assumption that the claimant makes.

And in this case# the reason I think this case

should be resolved without remand is that they never

purported to act with any constitutional standard at

all.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR.HOROWITZ;

16

As I said at the outset, there

is totally taken care of oy the judicial proceeding,

8850 is what applies to that.

21

he could file a Rule 41-E motion.

If there is some probable

nothing to do with that property interest.

There is no

because of a suggestion your opponent made, supposing

MR. HOROWITZ:

there's no prompt disposition requirement in the

remission proceeding, so I don't think the remission

proceeding takes care of it, and the remission

2

unconstitutionally seized.

3

He doesn't have any right to any disposition

4

of the remission proceeding, and when he gets a letter

5

from the Secretary of the Treasury telling him what the

6

outcome of the remission proceeding is, whether it's

7

denial, or an offer of a certain settlement, a certain

8

figure, he's got exactly the same property interest that

9

he had before he filed the remission petition.

But the statute says that the

factor that should be considered.

QUESTION*

2

But could the Department adopt a

3

rule saying, we realize Congress has said that tue

4

willfulness is an element, but we've decided it takes

too much time to consider willfulness.

disregard it and just consider forfeitability?

Would that be permissible?

10

We simply will

He wouldn't

13

Earlier I thought you said that the

really with the due process question here. Justice

Stevens.
There's just no independent right in remission

proceedings to due process.

8

I'd like to talk if I have a minute about this

9

10

rich versus poor thing, because it's not only a rich

11

person like Mr. Von Neumann who could bring this really

12

ridiculous lawsuit, it's the poor people whc have their

13

items seized who really don't have an interest: in the

14

j

Ninth Circuit's decisions here because those are the

15

people who need for Customs to decide these remission

16

petitions and to give them back the property, most of

17

the property they've had seized, and it's just not in

,8

their interest to have people at the Customs Service

19

looking over their shoulder at what is likely to be an

20

invalidation of the forfeiture by the Ninth Circuit

21

sometime down the road and acting on these petitions

22

hastily.

Now,

we don't say in our brief that we'll give

24

these petitions short shrift or that we'll deny them all

25

if we lose this case.

We do say that the due process

clause — the Constitution doesn *t prevent us from doing

2

that and certainly in borderline cases, in cases where

3

the Customs Service doesn't have the opportunity to

4

investigate, they’re going to be put in a position where

5

they act on these things more quickly and less favorably

6

to the claimants if they’re concerned about 36 days

7

being too long for them to hold on to one of these

8

things.

9

So, I do think there is an interest the

10

claimants have in this case, but it’s not the interest

11

that is taken into account by the Ninth Circuit.
