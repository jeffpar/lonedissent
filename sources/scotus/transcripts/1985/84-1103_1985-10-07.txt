ORAL ARGUMENT OF JACK T. LASSITER,

ESC•

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MS. LASSITER:

Mr.

Chief Justice,

and may it

6

please the Court, the issue presented in Hill v.
7
Icckhart is rather a technical and narrow issue, but one
8

I think

is significant in the daily workings of the

9

criminal courts.
10

Petitioner William

Hill entered a guilty

plea

11

in the Pulaski

County Circuit

Court

in

1979 to charges

12

of murder and

theft of

property.

He received

a 35-year

13

sentence

on the first

degree murder conviction and

a

14

concurrent ten-year sentence on the theft of property
15

convicti on .
16

In his habeas

petition which he filed pro se,

17

which appears in tie joint appendix at 8 and

9 he

18

alleged

that he pled with the

inderstanding that he

19

would receive a 35-year sentence and that he would

be

20

parole eligible after serving one-third

of his sentence,

21

less good time.

Oh, 8 and 9.
I'm sorry, Your Honor.

Thank you.
He also indicated that his

lawyer told him that the Court would impose a 35-year

10

sentence.

He alleged that his lawyer told him that he

11

would be out in six years if he stayed out of trouble.

12

He alleged that he was not advised of Act 93

13

which rendered him parole ineligible until serving

14

one-half of his sentence less good time, since he was a

15

second offender.

16
17

QUESTIONS
Does he allege that he had told --t
or told his lawyer all of his factual background so that

18

his lawyer would know that Act 93 was applicable?

MR. LASSITER:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

position is that if he didn't tell counsel, counsel

2

should have inquired about that, that that would be part

3

of the diligence that counsel should demonstrate in

4

defending one in a criminal case, and I

5

also demonstrate that at a hearing.

But the law in Arkansas at the time

was that had he gone to trial he would serve half of any

That's correct.

No claim of erroneous advice from

MR. LASSITER;

That's correct, and we also do

not claim that the Court was under a duty to advise

Petitioner as to potential parole eligibility.

We don't

8

make that claim.
9

We make the claim that his coinsel
10

affirmatively misadvised him; that is, he told him that
11

he would be parole eligible at serving one-third less

good time, that he told him that would be about six
13

years if he stayed out of trouble, that he would not

QUESTION*

Would you mind explaining what the

2

law in Arkansas is on alleging and proving prior

3

convictions to enhance or determine parole eligibility?

4

If I understand it correctly, the State is not required

5

to allege and prove the prior conviction.

6

HR. LASSITER:

7

QUESTION*

That’s correct. Your Honor.

That’s a determination to be made

8

by the parole beard after the conviction and the

9

sentence, is that right?
HR. LASSITER:

10

It is determined by the

11

Arkansas Department of Corrections.

12

received at the Department of Corrections they will

13

check his prior record through the Arkansas Crime

14

Information Center and the FBI, and then if they find a

15

;ricr felony conviction for which he was incarcerated,

16

then they use that in computing his parole eligibility

17

that date.

When the inmate is

eligibility are a collateral and not a direct

Also, the Eighth Circuit looks at the Fourth

1

2

Circuit cases of Strader versus C'Tuel discussed in the

3

brief and finds here that counsel's misadvice, alleged,

4

dees not rise tc the level of gross misinformation as

5

addressed in Strader and O'Tuel.

6

There is one matter here that 1 vculd like tc

7

address initially because the cases cited in the brief,

8

a number of them, distinguish between what we call

9

positive misadvice and

statements by counsel that are

10

called a mere prediction, or present only a hope of

11

leniency.
The State argues that in the situation that

12
13

Mr. Fill found himself in, and with the series of events

14

as alleged by Hr. Hill,

15

counsel's advice here could only be of <

16

nature,

17

of being positive misadvice, and the State argues that

18

that is so because under the Arkansas Pules of Criminal

19

Procedure, the trial judge does not have to accept the

20

recommendation of the State.

that this could cnly — that

If we had a hearing on this matter,

I also

8

think that I could show that this particular judge at

9

that time in 1979 accepted almost all recommendations

10

from the State on negotiated pleas, and it was his

11

practice, if he was not going to accept that

12

recommendation, to allow the defendant to -QUESTIONS

13

Well, under this plea the highest

17

QUESTIONS

Five to 50, or life.

And had the judge given the maximum

18

sentence, then this Mr. Hill would not have had to serve

19

longer than the time he is objecting to here,

20

true?

21

isn't that

A third of 50 would be how much?
And hew is he prejudiced, then, by the fact
V

22

that he got a lesser sentence that he has tc serve half

23

of, which wouldn't be any more than had he received the

24

maximum sentence and served a third of it?

25

MR. LASSITERs

Well, the allegation is that he
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

entered the plea based on advice by counsel that he

2

would receive the 35 years, and he did receive the 35

3

years, and that he relied on that in entering the plea.

4

If he had received a 50-year sentence then the same

5

parole lavs would have been in effect.

6

had to have served one-half less good time and not

7

one-third less good time, as counsel told him he would

8

have to serve.

9

QUESTIONS

He would have

But, now, when the judge asked him

10

whether any promises were made to him to get him to

11

enter the plea agreement, his response was, nc, nothing

12

that didn't appear on the agreement.

13

Are you relying for purposes of this case on a

14

promise that he would get 35 years maximum, or not?

15

Because, that would be i;., conflict with the face of the

16

plea agreement and I hadn't understood that ycu had

17

raised that and were relying on that.

18

I understood that you were relying only on an

19

allegation that the lawyer had told him something about

20

his parole eligibility date, not that he had been

21

promised that he would get a 35-year sentence, maximum.

22

MB. LASSITEB;

Well, T think I have to address

23

the issue of what sentence that the lawyer told him he

24

would get, in order to demonstrate that the lawyer's

25

advice concerning potential parole eligibility was not

That is correct, under the Arkansas Rules of Criminal

QUESTION*

Is it your argument that the

8

Constitution requires that in plea bargaining, in

9

hearing before the trial court, that always there is a

10

right, a constitutional right to know the earliest date

11

at which parole may be pursued?

12

MR. LASSITER;

No, Your Honor.

13

arguing that.

14

the Constitution places a duty on the attorney to advise

15

properly when he does that, and to not overlook in

16

easily accessible published statute that controls parole

17

eligibility.

18

I*m not arguing that.

We are not

I am arguing that

That's what we argued.

QUESTION*

Let me ask one other factu.1

19

question.

You indicated that the basis for the claim

20

that he would not have entered an innocent plea if he

21

had known the true facts, is in your objections rather

22

than in the habeas — that's apparently, though, that's

23

a document that you prepared?

24

MR. LASSITER;

25

QUESTION;

That's not under oath?

That’s correct, Your Honor.

I mean, there's no way you could

to this.

So, is it proper in your view for the

2

record to be made up of, in effect, factual statements

3

in a brief in support of your position?

essentially what it is.

HR. LASSITER:

Again, as I said a moment age,

I think, counsel is under a duty to inquire about prior

9

QUESTION:

And also, let me address --

Just one other observation.

The

10

lawyer who is now deceased, and apparently died just

11

shortly before the habeas corpus petition was filed,

12

apparently if he was a public defender,

13

wouldn'l know about Act 93 but I could understand how he

I'm amazed he

It surprises me

also.
QUESTION:

Mr. Lassiter, couldn't your client

18

have amended his habeas corpus petition if at the tame

19

you were objecting to the Magistrate's report it

subject of whether he would have entered this plea had

Corrections

2

I believe that that was probably just a result

3

of having at that time some of the judges continuing to

4

do that, because prior to the enactment cf .Set 93 if one

5

was under the age of 21 and he would be immediately

6

parole eligible upon being sent to the Arkansas

7

Department of Corrections as a first offender, and

8

judge could make him serve one-third less good time by

9

saying he had to serve a third.

10

I think that was just force of habit.

the

His

11

statement that he was to do one-third would have had no

12

effect whatsoever on the amount of time that he was to

13

serve.

MR. LASSITER:

It*s possible but it would have

Correction would have caught it cnce he arrived there.

if they'd known — I don't know what that conviction

It might have been something that might have made

I just don't know, and if you get a hearing

MR. LASSITER;

I would have to assume that --

again, we would speculate here, but I would have to

assume that the prosecutor was aware of that because

routinely they run an FBI check on people that are

charged with serious grime.

QUESTION;

Well, is it your suggestion the

prosecutor didn't know about Law 93 either?

about it — I find it rather surprising that trained

So, criminal

If you;re going to negotiate a plea they want

I think we could show at a hearing by putting

on attorneys that this kind of advice is extremely

important during the course of representing a client
11

when negotiating a plea.

I think that we could prove

12

that rather easily and

I think we could show that if an

breach of a duty owed a client, and a bre< ch of

QUESTION*

11

MR. CLARK* The simple issue,

I submit to the

12

Court in this case, is whether the Court of Appeals

13

erred in finding that the Petitioner was not

14

ccnstitutiorally entitled to an evidentiary hearing in a

15

collateral httack of his voluntary guilty plea.
I submit to you, the Court of Appeals did not

16
17

make error.

This Court on several occasions has

emphasized

20

bargaining process to work, a guilty plea must be

21

accorded a great measure of finality.

the validity and importance of plea

\

22

23

accuracy of this^guilty plea,

this voluntary guilty

24

plea, is evidenced by the record.

generally speaking, parole eligibility is net a direct

tut rather a collateral consequence of any guilty plea.

2

It is unnecessary to advise the defendant who desires tc

3

plead guilty as to parole eligibility, and

4

the defendant is misadvised does not in itself per se

5

negate that voluntary plea.

6

the fact that

In fact, we have found in the Federal Criminal

7

Pules of Procedure, Rule 11, that the -- we have stated

8

in the comments that not only is the guestion as advise

9

as to when someone might make parole or he parole

10

eligible, but whether, and that is true in Arkansas as

11

there is no requirement to advise as to parole

12

eligibility.
In the case at bar the record clearly

13
14

demonstrates, I submit to this Court, that parole

15

eligibility was not a part of the plea bargain, and that

16

this Petitioner was not wrongfully induced to plead

17

guilty based on some assertion.

18

I would further submit to tnis Court th. t a

19

better rule of law is that even if the defendant was

20

ill-advised or misinformed as to what the precise

21

eligibility is tc be for parole, that fact alone does

22

not away from guilt or the desire to enter a plea of

23

guilty.

There must be some demonstration of prejudice.

In particular, I submit to you today, what

troubles me about this case is that the so-called

10

only that individual's unilateral expectation, an

expectation which rarely, as in this case, if ever can

be tested by any objective standard, and which submits

virtually every guilty plea, and in Arkansas there are

14

some 10,000 entered each year, to attack collaterally at

determines that his expectations, wnatever they may have

State's response to the federal habeas petition, and

which appears to be a transcript of a proceeding before

the district court, or at least the State's version of
13

what happened before the Arkansas trial court.
14

On page 18, the paragraph towards the bottom
15

of the page, after the indented observation where the
16

Court says something, and this apparently is the State's

of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole."

I think it would

have to undermine the voluntariness, as I have

12

determined that voluntariness to be, the informed waiver

QUESTION*

14

What if the defendant's lawyer just

advised him that parole is available and usually, if you

behave yourself, it will be one-third, and it turns out
