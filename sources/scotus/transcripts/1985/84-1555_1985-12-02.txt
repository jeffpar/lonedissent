PROCEEDING?
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGEE;

Mr. Jett, I think you

may proceed whenever you're ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT 3F WAYNE JETT, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS IN NO. 84-1555
MR. JETT;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
This case presents the question whether a
federal statute which creates a new legal obligation
requiring one private party to pay money to another
private party takes property in violation of the taking
clause of the Fifth Amendment.

This statute, known as

ERISA, enacted in 1974, as amended in

1980, requires an

employer who ceases participation in a multiemployer
pension trust to pay money to the pension trust in
amounts computed according to the statute as withdrawal
liability.
The essential undisputed fact in this case
that absent the statute imposing the obligation,

lS

the

employer otherwise would have no obligation to pay money
to the pension trust.

Under the statute, the -obligation

to pay the money as withdrawal liability is triggered
when the employer withdraws or ceases to have an
obligation to contribute to the pension trust.
Now, in practice and in the case before this

Court, this means that the employer has failed to enter

2

into a new collective bargaining agreement requiring a

3

continued contribution into the pension trust.

4

Therefore, in effect, if there is no ability to arrive

5

at a consensual agreement between the union and the

6

employer which includes continued contributions into the

7

pension trust, the withdrawal liability taking of

8

property is triggered.

To get back to your original point, the statutory

in the plan, under the statute as amended the statute

Well, Your Honor, as far as the

trust and the relationship tetween the trust and the

provisions of the trust document.
The trustees are responsible for caretaking

that document and are entitled to assert the

constitutional right of the infirmity cf the statute in

how much have they been asked to pay?

MR. JETTi

It would have been zero, because a

defined contribution plan would not be covered by this

statute.

statute was one in which the employer promised to pay a

fixed or defined contribution.

*74

11

statute, as I would make about the *80 amendment, is

12

that from the date of enactment of that statute there

13

was a- taking of property from the employer based on two

14

events that were not subject to the control of the

15

employer.

The first event was the termination of the

any need for additional funds they would assess the

those events were completely outside of the control of

Sc both cf

We come then to the 1980 circum stance, and we

8

have still a statute, as this Court determined in the

9

B.A. Gray case,

that Congress did not permit an

10

opportunity for

the employer to decide whether he would

11

or would not continue in the pension plan under this new

12

circumstance in which the statute imposes the

13

liability.

14

Under that circum stance, there was never a

15

hiatus period allowing the employer to withdraw from the

16

plan before this new liability came into effect.

17

a matter of fact, as P.A. Gray said, they wanted to make

18

sure ne didn't have that opportunity.

19

And as

So we cannot, have under the statute at any

20

time since the enactment date in

there is a consensual opportunity for the employer to

agree to the taking of his property.

its opinions looks at the taxing cases under Article I,

interprets that power to tax as being consistent with

17

the taking protection in the Fifth Amendment.

MR. FELLNER:

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

please the Court:
We will make two arguments this afternoon:

17

first, that the taking clause simply dees net apply tc

18

the Multiemplcyer Act; and secondly, that even if this

19

statute does implicate the taking clause, that it meets

20

any and all of the tests articulated by this Court in

21

resolving taking clause questions.

22

Now, our threshold position is that the taking

23

clause has never been thought to apply to socioeconomic

24

legislation which simply imposes a liability on one

25

party to compensate another party for the harm or

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

potential harm that he causes.

This Court decided in

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation versus P.A.

Gray in

1984 that the M ultiem pic yer Act — and X quote from the
Court's opinion — "merely requires a withdrawing
employer to-compensate a pension plan for benefits that
have already vested with the employees at the time of
the employer's withdrawal."
Using the words of the Fifth Amendment,
private property is simply not being taken for the
public use without just compensation.

When the Congress

requires withdrawing employers to pay for the
consequences of their own conduct, no taking clause
violation is implicated.
Now, this is precisely the kind of
compensatory statute J. c which the taking clause should
not be applied.

QUESTION;

Well,

I guess the worry here is the

10

fact that the plan may have been one which is sponsored

11

and effectively controlled by the union, not the

12

employer, and the employer may have been induced to join

13

it be representations by the union that their liability

14

would be limited in accordance with the terms of the

plan, and in fact their withdrawal may be automatically

is this vast potential liability.

MR. FELL’EE*

This statute, Your Honor, has a

and insofar as the retroactive

21

effect was concerned, while there was a contract that

22

limited the liability of the employers in this case,

Now, I would submit that the statute at issue
here, precisely as Justice Rehncuist pointed out, is
very much like the social security statute.

It is like

the black lung statute which was at issue in Dsary
Elkhorn.

Would he be able to avoid it that way?

11

MR. FELLNER:

Mr. Chief Justice, let me

suggest that there are numerous ways in which withdrawal

13

liability can be avoided by the seller.

14

there is a simple sale of stock, no withdrawal liability

15

is triggered.

16

employer, and the purchasing employer remains

18

20

circumstances no withdrawal liability is triggered.

For example, if

If there is a sale of assets and certain

And consequently,

in order to judge this

22

statute in terms of its entirety — and that's why

23

rationality should be the touchstone of judging a

24

statute from stem to stern — it seems to me that under

25

those circumstances the Court should take into

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

consideration all of the ameliorative provisions in this

statute before it ran strike it down.

3

Now, assuming arguendo that, as Appellants

4

claim,

5

submit that basic notions of justice, of fairness, have

6

informed this Court's analysis, and under these notions

7

the Multiemployer Act is clearly constitutional.

8

As Justice O'Connor pointed out in her

9

the taking clause does apply in this case, we

colloquy with Mr. Freeman, the predominant question

10

under the taking clause is whether withdrawing employers

11

hae been arbitrarily singled cut to share the costs --

12

and I emphasize, share the costs, because as one court

13

put it, the pain is indeed spread around among

14

participants and among withdrawing employers, as well as

15

those that pay premiums, and remaining employers, those

16

who continue to contribute to the plan.

17

The question is whether withdrawing employers

18

have been singled out to share those costs of

19

maintaining pension plan stability, and I return

Gray case.

May I ask you one question.

22

Justice O'Connor raised the question about the standing

23

of the trustee to litigate on behalf of the employers.

24

What's your view on that, that issue?

25

MR. FELLNER;

Well, we recognize, of course,

that the standing issue is certainly the primary

2

difficulty of the appellants rather than the Appellees

3

in this particular case.

4

that the trustees do have standing in this case.

5

trustees have alleged — we believe their allegations do

6

not rise to the level of constitutional significance,

7

but they have alleged that certain kinds cf harm which

8

they feel are triggered by withdrawal liability endanger

9

or may endanger new employers from joining the plan.

10

However, on balance we feel

They may endanger ultimate pension plan viability.

11

Now, that allegation is contrary to the

12

findings of Congress in this case.

Similarly,

Returning to the taking clause question, let

me remind the Court what it said in PBGC versus Gray,

18

and there the Court concluded that if withdrawal

20

those employers that remain in the plan would have to

21

increase their contributions to cover the liabilities

that withdrawing employers,

24

would have to increase their contributions in order to

cover the liabilities that withdrawing employers leave

Those three factors appear tc infuse this

than when interference arises from a public program

11

QUESTIONS

Well, would you think if the

comes to impasse, there's a strike, he hires

person, not a single one of his prior employees --

8
9

HR. FELLNER*

Let me first of all suggest that

under Section 4218 of the statute any withdrawal that is

10

triggered by a strike does not trigger withdrawal

11

liability.

12

to that particular question.

13

single

It seems tc me that that is the short answer

Congress recognized in this statute that there

14

were extremes of manipulation which could create a

withdrawal liability that the/ did not want to do, and

under 4218 that particular hypothetical does not occur.
