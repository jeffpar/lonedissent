OPAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER, ESQ.

5

CN BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

7

MR. KNEEDLER.:

and may it please the Courts
The guestion presented in this case is whether

8

9

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

respondents have a right to judicial review of matters

10

concerning the amount of benefits under Part E of the

11

Medicare program.

12

of supplementary medical insurance that pays in general

13

30 percent of the reasonable charge of physician services

14

and other services.

15

Part B establishes a voluntary program

Part A of the program,

which establishes the

16

basic hospital insurance program, is not directly

17

involved in this case.

18

here, however, is that under Part A Congress has

19

expressly provided for judicial review of benefit

20

determinations where the amount in controversy exceeds

21

51,003,

22

to provide for judicial review under the Medicaid

23

program,

24
25

The principal relevance of Part A

and this demonstrates that where Congress intends

it expressly does so.
Under Part B,

however, Congress has not

affirmatively authorized judicial review.

ago, ia Unite! States versus Erika,

2

unanimously held that by this omission Congress had

3

deliberately foreclosed judicial review.

4

this Court

The Court there relied on what Congress

5

perceived to be the relatively insubstantial amount of

6

money involved in the typical Part B claim.

7

adhered to this view of reviewability under Part B just

8

two terms ago in Heckler versus Ringer.

The Court

Although Congress has extensively revised the

9
10

Part B program

11

decided, it has not enacted Legislation to overrule that

12

decision.

13

result, however, and is we point out in our reply brief

14

the committee reports on those bills demonstrate

15

Congress's understanding that under existing law judicial

16

review is entirely foreclosed under Part B.

17

in a number of

respects since Erika was

Bills have been introduced to accomplish that

In these circumstances we believe it would be

18

especially prudent foe the Court to adhere

19

in Erika and Ringer and leave to Congress, which is

20

studying the matter, the question of whether exceptions

21

should be carved out to that preclusion.

22

QUESTION*

to its rulings

"r. Kneedler, do you think that

23

constitutional challenges to the application cf the

24

Secretary's guidelines concerning Part B can be

25

challenged in court?

MR. KNEEDLS31

WelL, as we pointed out in our

2

brief, of course we think that issue is not presented

3

here because the particulae -----

6

QUESTION*

Well, they’ve certainly made a

constitutional claim.
MS. KKEEDLEB*

They have made a constitutional

7

claim, but it is our submission,

8

stated in the brief, that it is so insubstantial as not

9

to vest the Court with subject matter jurisdiction under

for the reasons we have

10

the rationale that the Court disposed of the

11

constitutional claim in Ringer itself.

12

We think that's so because the regulation

13

that's being challenged simply authorizes the

14

establishment of separate charge screens, or prevailing

15

charge screens, based on the charging patterns that exist

16

in the community, and where a carrier implements that

17

principle and adopts separate prevailing charge screens

18

that are simply based on the charging patterns in the

19

community, we think that that can in no way be thought to

20

be so utterly lacking in rational justification under

21

Flemming versus Festor as to —

22

QUESriDNj

Wall, it did -- it did appear to me,

23

anyway, that the plaintiffs below made three different

24

hinds of challenges.

utilization and application of the Secretary's rules on

Part B,

and second was a challenge to the Secretary’s

2

regulations themselves, and an allegation that the

3

Secretary's regulations did not meet the statutory

4

reguirements that Congress hid laid down, and third, a

5

constitutional challenge.
Now, do you think that Erika precludes the

6
7

constitutional challenge?

8

think it's insubstantial?
NR.

9

KNEEDLER;

I guess you think not, but you

WelL, yes.

Erika, we think,

10

didn't address it because there was not a constitutional

11

question raised.
QUESTIONS

12

What about an allegation that the

13

regulations of the Secretary singly don’t conform to the

14

statute?

15

HP. KNEEDLER;

On that question, we think tha

16

judicial review is plainly foreclosed.

17

itself involved a challenge to instructions from the

18

Secretary that is, insofar as the carrier is concerned,

19

there is binding regulations, and the Court --

The lanjuage in Erika doesn't lake

21

too clear that that was intended.

24

discuss the carrier's challenge to the intermediary

were not avalid basis for the carrier to deny claims.
QUESTIDNi

Well, why would a challenge to the

6

regulation as net meeting the statutory requirement be a

7

burden to the Court such as review of the typical Part B

8

benefit claim?

9

US. K NE ED LS R s

Well, the typical Part B benefit

10

claim might well often include a challenge to a

11

regulation or instructions or legal principles upon which

12

the carrier relied, and it would not be difficult for a

13

claimant to allege that.

14

there are now over 300 million claims a year filed under

15

the Fart B program and more than 30 million enrollees, so

16

the potential for bringing tnese questions in to court is

17

rather substantial, in our view.

1E

Ani I would point out that

Also, the premise of Erika that Congress has

19

precluded judicial review of matters concerning the

20

amount of benefits extends not simply to the factual

21

determinations but to the legal ones as well,

22

decision on a claim for benefits is really analogous to a

23

court's judgment which includes not simply findings of

24

fact but the application of law to it, and so where

25

Congress has precluded review of a decision concerning

because a

(202) 628-9300

1

the amount of benefits,

2

legal rules that the carrier has applied in arriving at

3

that determination.

4

that necessarily includes the

As «e have pointed out in our brief from the

5

beginning, the regulations governing the carrier hearing

6

program have provided that the carrier's decision on a

7

claim for benefits is final and binding and it is not

8

subject to further review, and that the carrier is to

9

adhere to the Secretary's view of the meaning of the

10

statute and regulations.
Putting these together, we think it's quite

11
12

clear that the preclusion of review of amount of benefits

13

under Part B includes questions of law.or regulations.
One other point I'd

14

like to make in this regard

15

is if the Secretary had never issued the regulation

16

involved in this case,

17

on its own interpretation of the statute, that it's clear

18

that judicial review would be precluded under the

19

rationale of Erika beraaue tnere in Erika as here, there

20

was a statutory challenge to the prevailing fee

21

limitation that the carrier was using.

and the carrier had simply relied

22

In fact, it was a challenge based on the vary

23

same sentence of the Act upon which respondents rely in

24

this case.

25

Secretary has given some interpretive guidance to the

All that has happened here is tilt the

2

but the issuance of a regulation should not in our view

3

provide a vehicle for judicial review.

4

QUESTION*

What if the Secretary promulgated a

5

regulation abolishing carrier review entirely?

6

that be reviewahle, do you suppose -- just said it cost

7

too much money?
MR. KNEEDLER*

8
9
10

Well, I guess at some point the

Secretary’s actions would be so far removed from the
administration of the program and --

11
12

Would

QUESTION;

Do you think, that would be

-

reviewahle?
MR. KNEEDLER;

13

I would hesitate to give a

14

definitive answer, but I would think it might well be

15

because for one thing it doesn't really concern the

16

amount of benefits or --

17

QUESTION*

Well, let’s say he just abolished

18

carrier reviews for certain t inds of injuries, broken

19

legs or something, no carrier review in certain kinds of

20

injuries.

21

Would that be reviewahle?
MR. KNEEDLER*

Well, it may well be, but

22

because the Secretary would not be giving directions on

23

how to adjudicate particular claims --

24
25

QUESTION;

Tie argument wouLI be, he’s not

complying with the statute?

ME. KNEEDLEE*

No,

it would be beyond that.

2

That would be, among other things, collateral to the

substantive determination of the claim and the amount of

the claim.

claims.
MR. KNEEDLSRi

9

I mean, whatever category

It will effect the claim,

but

10

what we have here is something that goes directly to the

11

amount of benefits which is at the core of what Congress

12

has precluded.

13

authorizes review of uder Part A ani hence precludes

14

review of under Part B.

It's what 1395 FF affirmatively

The prevailing fee limitation is an essential

15
16

element in the calculation of the reasonable charge, and

17

claimant cannot separate out that particular issue, legal

18

issue of the prevailing charge.
QUESTIONS

19

Ir. other words, the scope of your

20

position is that whatever is authorized under A is

21

necessarily forbidden under B, but something that's

22

forbidden under both, you could review under B?
MR. KNEEDL5R;

23

Well, that is essentially our

24

position.

The abolishment of the claims u d ju dication

process is not an issue that arises in the adjudication

get into the claims adjudication process that culm inates

HR. K NEEDIER;

He

Well, that's right, but the

8

Court made the point that a court cannot essentially

issue a declaratory judgment under the 1331 jurisdiction

10

to expound on a legal issue arising under the Medicare

11

program.

The legal issues have to be taken to court, if

QUESTION*

Mr. iCneedler, will you clarify for

6

me why the difference, between

7

so significant?

Part A and Part B review is

Part A provides very substantial review.

8

MR. KNEEDIER*

9

QUESTION*

It does.

Judicial review, and my

10

understanding is, Part A provides for reimbursement of

11

hospitals.

12

MR. yNEEDIER *

13

QUESTTONi

14

MR. KNEEDT.ER*

That’s correct.

Why the difference?
Well, it was Congress’s judgment

15

in enacting the Medicare program that Part A was

16

typically going to involve much greater amounts of money

17

in a typical claim.

18

QUESTION.

19

20

Part B would involve greater amounts

of money?
MB. KNEEDLER*

No, Part A.

I’m sorry.

Part B,

21

a claim can consist of nothing more than a claim for a

22

doctor's visit which can be £10 or £15, and Congress was

23

concerned about flooding the courts with these relatively

24

insignificant claims, whereas a hospital visit is likely

25

to give rise to a substantiaL medical bill.

And Congress 313 provide for judicial review,

but significantly it limited it to situations in which

the practical difference, the difference in

It seems to us that this is precisely

10

the sort of minor reimbursement dispute that Congress

11

wanted to keep cut of the courts.

12

As we point

out in our brief, also the bills

13

that are pending before Congress now would make the Part

14

B review provisions parallel to those under Part A 3nd

15

allow for judicial review only where there is that $1,000

16

in controversy.

17

QUESTION#

Do you think it's open for the

18

Secretary to provide by regulation for administrative

19

review of claims like this under Part P?

20

HP. KNEEDLERw

It may well be.

There are

21

existing mechanisms for the Secretary to review, not in

22

every case but the Secretary has a quality review

23

mechanism whereby a sample of

the carrier's cases are

What is the mecnanism in place now

to review a carrier’s development of guidelines or rules

2

to govern how physicians’ services are going to be

3

compensated ?

4

SE. OEEDLER:

There are several.

There is an

5

annual evaluation of the carrier’s performance that is

6

conducted by the — that is conducted by HCFA, the Health

7

Care Financing Ad ministration, which is an assessment of

8

the carrier’s overall performance.

9

This is discussed at some length in our briefs

10

in FicClure four terms ago.

11

discussed in the testimony in the record in this case,

12

was that there was an

13

15

carrier is using the right approach in evaluating that

The other form of oversight is, as I mentioned,

2

rulemaking could be submitted to the Secretary along with

3

relevant supporting data.

4

So, there are mechanisms that can be resorted

5

to, and

along these same lines Congress had last year

6

commissioned a study by the Iffice of Technology

7

Assessment which we also point out in our brief under the

8

Deficit Reduction Act of 1934 , to study the differences

9

in charge levels for physicians' services according not

10

only to specialty differences but the locality and the

11

type of service.

12

So, there's also rather extensive congressional

13

oversight of the way in whin the Part B program is

14

administered.
QUESTION^

15

But the question here is so Jasic.

16

It's an allegation that the statute says if the services

17

provide! by the physicians are identical, that no

18

different level of compensation is permitted, based on

19

specialization, and that's a pretty basic question, isn't

20

it?a
*R. KNEEDLER:

21

slell, what the statute says is

22

that the reasonable charge cannot exceed 75 percant of

23

the customary charges for similar services.

24

seems to us to he a reasonable construction of the

25

phrase,

QUESTION*

Before you do, Mr. Gilchrist, I'm

23

not sure you've completely answered wr. Kneedler's

24

argument that the doctor, if he takes an assignment of a

25

claim and he doesn't like the two tier or three tiers,

whatever it is, is really assing far recovery that

relates solely

4

to the amount of benefit that he can get.

Why isn't solely the amount of benefit involved
here?
M3. GILCHRIST*

5

First of all, there's a serious

6

question here as to whether this could be an amount of

7

benefit case at all, and let me give you some examples.
The board certified

respondents in this case, ar^ asking for a reduction in

10

benefits, in essence, if you accept the government's

11

position about equalizing the amount of payments because

12

they are in the specialist screen.

13

of benefits, the language of the legislative history that

14

pertains to determinations on

15

even within Part A where they grant judicial review of

16

determinations on amount of benefits, has to be tied in

17

together with the grant of authority to the carrier to

18

make ieterminations on amount of benefits.

The context of amount

We could dance all day in terms of what those

know what Congress meant by those words.

Does that help clarify it at all?

1

thank

2

you.

3

part about the petitioner's brief is, they don't cite a

4

single case for the proposition that the last sentence of

5

405-H which states that there is — no action may be

6

taken under 1331 against the Secretary, D.S. Government

7

officer and employee thereof to reco/er on any claims.

8
9

As to 4D5-A in Salfi and Seiner,

Okay,

the interesting

They don't cite a single case where that last
sentence was. taken oat of context with the balance of

10

405-H which is clearly precluding 1331 jurisdiction of

11

findings and decisions of the Secretary after a hearing,

12

and precluding judicial review by any tribunal of

13

findings and decisions of the Secretary after a hearing.

14

I don't wnt to get into a iispute as to

15

whether or not linger h id a sufficient reason for

16

2

think that's about as we can go in the Veiner

decision, and that states it very strongly.

4

Fehnquist in that decision stated that the last sentence

of 405-H cannot change meaning based upon .whether or not

6

a party has followed the mechanism available within

7

405-G, whether they've satisfied prerequisites, I think

8

were the exact words.

9

Justice

But here that's an absolute, irrelevant issue.

10

There are no prerequisites under 4D5-G for the

11

respondents to follow because 405-G simply doesn't apply,

12

and the proper context,

13

states that one may not bring 1331 jurisdiction to review

14

a decision by the Secretary through an•administrative

review.

That's in essence, also, the finding in Salfi.

I think that’s in essence what the government has done

they’ve ignored the balance of that section which is

clearly in the context of no 1331 jurisdiction, where

there have been other cases filed in federal court.

Congress held that a question relating to what the

QUESTION*

Basically, Erika simply involved the

question of whether or not individual claimants could

argue about the amount of benefits?

7

HR. KNEEDLER:

But the basis for their claim

8

was that the approach the carrier took to computing the

9

prevailing cnarge was inconsistent with the statute,

10

inconsistent with the same sentence of the statute upon

11

which the respondents in this case relied, and similarly

of nationwide scope, that could net be appealed to the

was that the Secretary's instructions that barred the
