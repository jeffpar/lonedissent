ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MR. THIEDE;

Mr. Chief

(202) 628-9300

1

by the Michigan Supreme Court where they created what

2

they thought to be an analogous rule to Edwards versus

3

«rizcna.
Simply stated, the Michigan Supreme Court held

4
5

that if a defendant, while at his initial appearance

6

before a magistrate who has no jurisdiction to accept a

7

final plea in the case, whose only job is ministerial,

8

in other words to advise a defendant of the charge

9

against him, set bond if bond is appropriate, and to

10

advise him of his right to counsel and to get the

11

administrative process going if he's indigent, the

12

Michigan Supreme Court said if the defendant asked for

13

appointed counsel at that stage, the police are

14

forevermore precluded from initiating interrogation of

15

that defendant.
Reading the cases of this Court, it seems that

16
17

there are two bases upon which this Court has excluded

18

confessions.

19

a constitutional right such as the Fifth Amendment

20

setting or Henry and Brewer and cases like that where

21

it’s the Sixth Amendment, or in the alternative, where

22

the confession itself is unreliable.

One is, when there is some impingement on

I don’t think either of those factors exist in

23
24

this case.

There is simply no ceason for the rule

25

established by the Michigan Supreme Court.

As Justice

1

White noted in, I believe Selum versus Stooms, the

2

follow-up case cn Edwards, in discussing its

3

retroactivity,

4

with the reliability of a confession.

the Edwards rule has very little to do

It hasn*t a real great deal to do with the

5
6

truth telling process, because there remains at all

7

times, apart from any per se rule, the ability of the

8

defense to challenge the voluntariness, and that of the

9

confession.

So, the per se rule does not change that.

10

It does not preclude the defendant from having an

11

opportunity to challenge the reliability of the

12

statement itself.
Edwards, however, did have the salutory effect

13
14

of giving the defendant some security in that while

15

asking for counsel during po.ice interrogation, the

16

police could no longer return and re-initiate

17

interrogation.

18

There seems to le a logical flow between a req- est for

19

counsel during interrogatio: and the secession of

20

interrogation,

21

re-initiate interrogation until counsel has been

22

provided.

That seems to be a logical result.

and a per se rule that the police cannot

23

I see no logical connection between

25

the Judge advises a defendant, you have a right to have

I think the Michigan Supreme

MR. THIEDE*

15

Exactly.

I think that's

16

necessary.

17

Michigan Supreme Court rule, we get into all kinds of

18

problems that they have obviously not anticipated with a

19

non-indigent defendant.

20

I think it's necessary because under the

Oftentimes we find it necessary to kind of

21

bolster the position of the indigent defendant so he's

22

on equal footing with a non-indigent.

23

this rase, the result is to do the opposite.

24

actually put the non-indigent defendant in a lower

25

position, because what the Michigan Supreme Court

He's got plenty of money.

Can they initiate —

8

NE. THIEDE:

9

And

Yes, I think so, and I think

there's some important reasons for that.

First of all,

10

as a practical matter,

at least in our courts, the

11

police are rarely present for arraignment, for this type

12

of an arraignment, for an initial appearance,

13

should use the terminology.

The Michigan

20

Supreme Court said, well, that's no problem because they

21

can go check the court file and see what has happened.
Well, I submit that there are a million and

22

one problems with the Michigan Supreme Court's thinking

24

on that.

25

and this would really preclude your first example, is

First of all, what the defendant does there,

MR. THIEDE:

No, I think
Did I misunderstand that?
I think we’re ^ot communicating

too well, sir.

5

for an attorney when ha's given his Miranda rights on

6

arrest by the police officers, then we hustle an

7

attorney down right away, or we simply don’t question

him and we will not return, because we can’t return

under Edwards.

11

What happens,

QUESTION:

you mentioned, if he asks

You don’t question him until he

gets a lawyer?

12

MR. THIEDE:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. THIEDE:

Right.

If he asks —

Is that correct?
That’s exactly right.

If he asks

15

during custodial interrogation, like the Edwards type

16

case, if during custodial interrogation the guy asks for

17

an attorney when given his Miranda rights or any time

18

thereaf -.er during custodial interrogation, he will not

19

be questioned agair unless he initiates the contact and

20

we again advise him of his rights and he waives them.

21

QUESTION:

What is this 12-day period?

22

MR. THIEDE:

That is the time under statute

23

that we have to bring a person for a preliminary

24

examination to see if there is probable cause to hold

25

him for trial.

3

QUESTION:

You mean, during those 12 days he's

not examined by the police?
HR. THIEDE:

If he has requested counsel at

4

any time during Miranda — during custodial

5

interrogation, he will not be questioned by police.

6

That’s what happens.

7

So, what we’re saying here, the difference

8

between our rule, what we think the law is, and the

9

Michigan Supreme Court, is that gives us the opportunity

10

once he’s asked for counsel in the — during the

11

judicial process, if that’s what you want to call it,

12

give us the opportunity to go and advise him of his

13

Miranda rights, make sure that when he says,

14

attorney to represent me in the judicial proceedings,"

15

that means also, ”1 want an attorney to represent me

16

during custodial interrogation."

"I want an

17

find if he says that, we don’t question him.

18

That’s the only burden on the defendant in this case,

19

to have to sift through Miranda rights after this

20

arraignment and be able to say, "I want an attorney.”

21

And they say,

22

that’s what they have to do.

I would think —

MR. THIEDE;

20

I think our position would still

21

have to be that it is appropriate only to preclude

22

further interrogation when the defendant asks for

23

counsel in a context which shows that he wants counsel

24

during interrogation, not simply during the judicial

25

process.

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION;

1

I suppose it is not explained to a

2

defendant at arraignment in Michigan that there is this

3

difference, as you see it?

4

MR. THIEDE*

Nc, it*s not.

But in contrast tc

5

many of the federal courts, I know of no circumstances

6

in Michigan where Miranda rights are given during this

7

arraignment, and that's what distinguishes many of the

8

federal cases as well.
Many of the federal cases, the magistrate not

9
10

only advises him of his right to counsel during the

11

judicial process, hut also reads the Miranda rights to

12

him.

13

QUESTION;

Do you think the defendant would

14

perhaps — if unsophisticated, at least, understand that

15

the attorney that was requested at arraignment would be

16

an attorney that would be available to assist during

17

questioning or a lineup or something of that —

18

MR. THIEDE;

Sure, no question about that, no

19

question about that.

And, that's why we’re not saying

20

that the police can now come in and get a confession out

21

of the man.

22

and advise him of his Miranda rights, and then he has an

23

opportunity to clarify that.

All we're saying is, the police can go in

24

The whole purpose, as I see it —

25

QUESTION;

And they can get a confession?
1 5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I

1

mean, I*m confused
MR. THIEDE;

2

Well, they can get a confession

3

if he waives counsel for that purpose, but we'll have tc

4

get a subsequent specific waiver of the right to counsel

5

during interrogation before we can get a confession from

6

him.

7

So, we really aren't playing games.

The

8

defense has continuously tried to put on us that we are

9

playing games between the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.

10

I'm not.

11

the subjective intention of the defendant can be made

12

objective by the advice of specific rights that talk

13

about, when do you want an attorney.

14

What I'm trying to do is provide a basis where

The judge at this initial appearance, says,

15

"Do you want an attorney during judicial proceedings?"

16

The defendant says, "Yes."

17

Estelle, as in cur case of Bladel --

20

QUESTIONS

As we noted in Nash versus

What is the language used at

arraignment, vhen the defendant is asked —
MR. THIEDEs

Okay.

At arraignment in district

21

court, there is -- it is set up by statute as well as by

22

rule, and the judge says, you have a right to an

23

attorney at the preliminary -- well, first he says, you

24

Yes, sir.
Supposing a particular judge or

magistrate, I forget the exact title, at that particular
hearing went ahead and said, by the way, I might as well
also explain to you what the Miranda warnings are, and
he reads him the Miranda warning and then gets all
through and says, now, do you want to fill cut the form.
The fellow says, yes, I want a lawyer, but
it’s kind of ambiguous.
MR. THIEDE*
especially ambiguous,

What would your position be?
Well, I think where it's

I think the police ought to have

the opportunity to clarify.

substance of the Miranda warning?

QUESTION*

May I just ask. one other question.

3

At the point in — that the Michigan Supreme Court

4

considers significant in this case, the hearing,

5

whatever you properly call it, in your view had the

6

Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached?

7

MR. THIEDE*

I would say that, assuming that

8

the Iowa procedures are similar to Michigan, then I

9

would have to say under Brewer versus Williams they had,

10

because we're in essentially the same position as we

11

were in Brewer.

12

I don't know especially about Iowa law and I

13

don't know if that's that significant.

14

though -- and here's where we get into another problem,

15

I think, with Sixth Amendment rights, and if we get in :o

16

the question of waiver, what content is necessary for

17

defendant to make a knowing waiver, is if we're going to

18

talk about when the trenches are dug and vhen the lines

19

are aligned, we're going to have to say it either begins

20

at the issuance of a warrant or at the preliminary

21

examination.

22

If we say,

Because, this little event that we have here,

23

this little meeting in the courtroom, does nothing to

24

change the position of the parties.

25

more committed to go after each other or less committed

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

to go after each other.

The judge is merely taking care

2

of some administrative functions.

3

So, I think y-'u're going to have to either go

4

to the issuance of the warrant when the State has said,

5

we at least have probable cause and we’re at least going

6

to arrest the guy and at least go to preliminary

7

hearing, or you're going to have to go all the way to

8

preliminary hearing as you have in Coleman versus

9

Alabama.

10

QUESTION*

The thing that puzzles me about

11

your position is, if you agree that he Sixth Amendment

12

right is attached, normally we're a little more strict

13

after the Sixth Amendment right attaches than under the

14

Fifth Amendment right under Miranda.

15

You are in effect saying that there should be

there would be in the Miranda context?

rule was analogous to Edwards, and I think this is

2

completely wrong.

3

The analogy to Edwards in the Sixth

4

setting of these particular requests for counsel would

5

be to show up at preliminary examination without having

6

appointed counsel ani start to have a prelira, because

7

he's asked for counsel during the judicial process and

8

now you return to the judicial process without counsel,

9

the same as in Edwards you ask for counsel during

Amendment

10

interrogation, you return to interrogation without

11

counsel.
That's the real analogy.

12

That's where logic

13

would take you if you were trying to make a logical and

14

analogical analysis of this case.
QUESTIONS

15

Mr. Tniede, would you be making the

18

where after the arraignment, if counsel is requester and

We’ve got a validly waived Miranda warning and they're

What’s the

Well, I don’t think, there needs

I don’t

7

think that counsel, in Justice Eehnguist’s words, at one

8

point, is a guru that the defendant always has to go

through.
We’re trying — we’re creating this creature

of a counsel who is always going to come in front of

13

especially under this Court’s analysis in Faretta and

14

that, but it’s the defendant’s right, not the attorney's

right.

16

Again, what we’re saying in response to this,

17

the only burden we’re placing on the defendant, the

highest burden he eve- has is to, after this initial

In 1938, in Johnson versus Zerbst, this Court

announced a general rule of waiver for the right to

counsel.

think I would like to just mention.

There are two aspects of that rule which I

voluntary, knowing and intelligent.

Intelligent means

Second, and this may be the key in this

presumption against waiver.

11

today is that the burden should be on the defendant to

say that he didn't mean — he didn’t really mean when he

requested counsel at the arraignment that he wanted it

What the State is arguing

subsequent to 1938, the Johnson versus Zerbst opinion,

has said, courts indulge every reasonable fresumption

against waiver.

well-founded presumptions which, I think, are applicable

8

The Court has said that

presumptions that are important to consider and which --

5

in viewing these presumptions will make it clear that

6

the Edwards rule is one that is appropriate.
The first presumption is that a layman is

7

8

unlikey to understand the value of counsel.

I think

9

that is abundantly clear from reading many of the

10

decisions of this Court, particularly starting with

11

Powell versus Alabama in 1932 where the Court said, even

12

the intelligent and educated layman requires the guiding

circumstances of this case, like the State today, have

2

made an upside-down application of the rule of Johnson

3

versus Zerbst.

4

That is, they have said, in essence, that the

5

burden is on the individual to show that he wants

counsel, whereas courts must indulge every reasonable

presumption against the waiver.

9

If you look at what happened in the case of

of the value of counsel or of the dangers of talking

OEAL ARGUMENT CF RONALD J. BRETZ, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT RUDY BLADE!
MR. BRETZi

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Courts
I join in counsel for Respondent Jackson's
arguments concerning the higher standard of waiver for
the Sixth Amendment.

I would like to spend my limited

time before the Court discussing the specific hclding of
the Michigan Supreme Court and the application of the
Edwards rule.
The court's holding , and our position in this
case is that the interrogation of the respondents
following their unequivocal request for counsel at
arraignment violated thri Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment
rights.
42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The court’s holding was based on one

2

elementary premise, and that is that the Sixth Amendment

3

right to counsel is a broad,

4

counsel that is provided for specifically in the

5

Constitution, and as a result it differs significantly

6

from the Miranda right to counsel which is referred to

7

as the Fifth Amendment right to counsel.
The Sixth Amendment provides the right to

8
9

lundamental right to

counsel at all stages of the proceedings including, in

10

this case, the post-arraignment interrogations.

I think

11

under this Court’s decision in Brewer it is very clear

12

that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applied during

13

that interrogation.
The Fifth Amendment right was designed only to

14
15

protect the cefendant’s rights to remain silent and as

16

has been stated before this Court, it routinely applies

17

in the pre-arraignment cutodial interrogation.
The premise of the S'xth Amendment right is a

18
19

broader and more fundamental right than the judicially

20

created Fifth Amendment right, I believe is self

21

evident, and is amply supported by this Court’s

22

decisions.

23

that the Sixth

24

least as scrupulously honored as the Fifth Amendment

25

right.

It follows,

I believe, from that premise

Amendment right to counsel must be at

MR. BRETZ*

11

Absolutely — well, my initial

argument is that they shouldn’t even have been in there

14

application of the Edwards rule, the police officers.

15

They should have left him alone pursuant to the rigid

Assuming that they were not aware

21

of that, I believe that at the point that my client

advised the police that, "I’ve already asked for an

23

24

said, "I haven’t seen him yet.

11

At a minimum, I would ask this Court to apply

the rigid bright line rule of Edwards versus Arizona to

13

this case and to any case where the defendant has

14

invoked his right to counsel whether that request is

15

J'hat is the distinction that petitioner has

17

raised before this Court today.

20

MR. BRETZ*

Exactly, and in this case the

11

facts are — that is the Bladel case — the facts are

12

that the interrogating officers’ superior, that is, the

13

chief investigator on the case, was in fact present at

arraignment, so there*s no great burden of having to

15

read ambiguous court files, they just call the boss and

he could have told him.

But again, I would remind the Court that under

If the Court does not
