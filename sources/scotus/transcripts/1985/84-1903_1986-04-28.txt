CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The Court will hear

arguments first this morning in Puerto Rico Associates

against Tourism Company of Puerto Rico.
Ms. Soto, you may proceed whenever you are

ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MS. MARIA MILAGROS SOTO, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANT
MS. SOTO:

9
10
11

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:
This case presents a substantial question

12

whether a statute of Puerto Rico violates the First,

13

Fifth ana Fourteenth Amendments of the United States

14

Constitution because it completely bans a franchise

15

holder, a casino franchise holder, from advertising or

16

otherwise offering its casino facilities to the public

17

of Puerto Rico.

18

without abanaoning our Fifth ana Fourteenth

19

Amendment attacks on Section 8 of the Games of Chance

20

Act of Puerto Rico, we have chosen to limit our argument

21

to the First Amendment protection extended to truthful

22

information about legal activities, and rely on our

23

briefs for the remaining valid grounds, although in our

24

minds, after living through the over-extensive

25

obligation that Puerto Rico has given to the statute, we
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

cannot characterize this ban as strictly commercial

2

speech.

3

abridges, has abridged in the past, as the record shows,

4

fully protected speech and public debate speech.

The over-breadth and vagueness of the ban

Neither can we accept as valid the

5

6

classification, subclassification, of a casino speech

7

ban versus the public forum availability open to other

8

gaining activities in Puerto Rico, nor the resident

9

versus nonresident classification that the judgment

10

below added to the original controversy.
However, argument on the First Amendment

11
12

content based classification of the Act should persuade

13

the Court to hold that casino advertising is protected

14

by the United States Constitution, and that all truthful

15

information about this legal activity cannot be blocked

16

by Puerto Rico in an effort to keep its people

17

uninformed as an extensive means of controlling through

18

speech the activity of gambling.
The best example of the dangers inherent in

19

20

over-broad prohibitions of speech, containing no

21

guidelines of enforcement for the government, are given

22

by the facts of this case.

23

reads:

24

advertise or otherwise offer its facilities in any

25

manner whatsoever to the public in Puerto Rico."

Section 8 of the statute

Puerto Rico.

Neither did it clarity whether in Puerto

QUESTION:

6

Ms. Soto, didn't the Superior Court

7

Judge substantially restrict the literal language of the

8

statute when he interpreted it?
MS. SOTO:

9

Yes, it did, Your Honor, but it dia

10

not cure the unconstitutionality of the statute as we

11

would argue.
QUESTION:

12

Well, what's left of the statute

13

now?

14

the media within Puerto Rico itself?

15

Is it just the prohibition against advertising in

MS. SOTO:

The statute as construed still

16

prohibits completely all information if it's addressed

17

to the residents of Puerto Rico.

18

still a complete ban of truthful information about a

19

legal business to the residents of Puerto Rico, and thus

20

unconstitutional, in our view, as construed.

21

22

QUESTION:

And therefore, it is

Well, is it media advertising that

it now covers, as the court below has construed it?

23

MS. SOTO:

Well, Your Honor —

24

QUESTION:

What if a matchbook with the name

25

of the casino came into the hands of a resident of

1

Puerto Rico.

Is that somehow prohibited now?

2

your understanding?

3

MS. SOTO:

Is that

According to what the Judge

4

decided, if it was aimed at the tourists it woula not be

5

prohibited.

6

what the intent is would have to be based on content.

The problem is that the determination as to

Each time that an advertisement or information

7
8

about a casino is -- comes across, and for instance, we

9

brought to this Court's attention a case whereby even

10

under the Court's construction now, as recently as after

11

this Court had granted jurisdiction to hear this case, a

12

supplement was published with information about the

13

casino activities upon the opening of the secona hotel,

14

the El San Juan Hotel, that merely covered the

15

facilities that were open to the public.
One page out of 52 that cover all the other

16
17

facilities of the hotel was conceded by the government

18

as casino advertising, and something that they had not

19

done before.

20

said that the case was being turned over for

21

investigation for criminal prosecution.

22

^

They did not fine us this time, but they

Now, this statute is a criminal statute and

23

this was a supplement by -- an article by the newspaper

24

was not an ad placed, as the Judge directed, and still

25

it's being considered as advertising to Puerto Rico.

(202) 628-9300

So

1

an example that we still have the same problem.

2

QUESTION:

Isn't your First Amendment argument

3

the same, though, whether the statute distinguishes

4

between ads aimed at tourists and ads aimed at Puerto

5

Ricans?

6

all ads about the casinos.

11

MS. SOTO:

That's what it does.

We understand

As the Court rewrote it, which we

that —

10

I mean, if the -- suppose the statute forbade

12

understand is what the Court did, and it is

13

impermissible in our view.

14

classification then that I think is also impermissible,

15

of residents versus nonresidents, yes.

16

QUESTION:

It would establish a

While I have you interrupted, your

17

general submission is that the First Amendment requires

18

-- or forbids stopping any aos about any legal business?

19

MS. SOTO:

If it's an absolute ban and it

20

leaves no channels open of communications to the

21

residents of Puerto Rico in this case, and the activity

22

is legal, we understand that unless there is a

23

substantial interest by the government, which has not

24

been proven in this case, it is unconstitutional, yes.

25

QUESTION:

Well, what if -- would you say it
7
AIDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

would be unconstitutional for Puerto Rico to say, "Well,

2

if you want to advertise casinos, be sure at the bottom

3

say, this may be dangerous to your pocketbook"?
MS. SOTO:

4

We have no quarrel whatsoever,

5

Justice White, on having more speech on it if we have

6

to, rather than silencing and keeping the people

7

uninformea altogether as a means.
QUESTION:

8
9
10

unconstitutional if Congress forbade all advertising of
cigarettes?
MS. SOTO:

11
12

Under your argument would it be

In the case of cigarettes, I find a

substantial distinction in that cigarettes —

13

QUESTION:

It's not illegal to smoke.

14

MS. SOTO:

It is not illegal to smoke.

15

It's not illegal to manufacture

cigarettes.

17
18
19

MS. SOTO:

That is correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Why woula a -- why, under your

However --

20

argument, would a complete ban on cigarette advertising

21

be bad or good?

22
23

MS. SOTO:

I haven't said that it's good.

I

think it probably would pass constitutional muster if --

24

QUESTION:

Why?

Why?

25

MS. SOTO:

link whatsoever that it causes a deleterious effect in

It may cause, if some people gamble

QUESTION:

6

In the case of

Don't you think that Puerto Rico

7

coula prohibit gambling altogether and make it illegal

8

because Puerto Rico coula aetermine that it's baa for

9

the citizens?
MS. SOTO:

10

Yes, I do, Your Honor, Justice

11

O'Connor.

I think they can prohibit it together.

But

12

having legalized it, and having other means available

13

alreaay in the Act that are affected, I don't think they

14

can --

15

QUESTION:

Well —

16

MS. SOTO:

Through speech, control it.

17

QUESTION:

Well, suppose you have a state like

18

Alaska that has legalized the use of marijuana, personal

19

use of marijuana.

21

MS. SOTO:

Do you think Alaska can prohibit all

I think once having legalizea it --

22

I am not familiar with the case of the marijuana statute

23

in Alaska, but once having legalized it, I think it can

be restricted through a means and manners restriction.

25

I think it can be adaed more speech as to what effects

-- so as to keep the people educated, how they should

not be using it.

3

to prohibit it altogether either, no.

But I don't think they should be able

QUESTION:

4

So, it would be unconstitutional

5

then to forbid aos about cigarettes, smoking, as long as

6

smoking is legal?
MS. SOTO:

7

As long as smoking is legal.

8

my position is, since it is inherently dangerous to

9

health, it might be possible to ban it.

What about marijuana?

That would be the same thing with

And, that is our proposition.

We can make that

But, it's not the same thing with gambling.
Gambling has not been

It is simply a leisure entertainment activity

18

for most of the people.

It's social, fun, thing to do,

19

and to some people it may be, if it's excessive, cause

some harm but that is not the general proposition here.

21

And if we extend now -- I mean, so many other

things could be harmful.

interest, ban on speech is not the narrowest means to

2

obtain that end.

3

QUESTION:

May I ask this question,

4

publications in the United States magazines and

5

newspapers ao circulate in Puerto Rico, don't they?

6

MS. SOTO:

Yes, they do.

7

QUESTION:

New York Times, Time, Newsweek and

9

MS. SOTO:

Yes.

10

QUESTION:

Does the statute ban -- would the

statute ban your casino from advertising in those

publications?
MS. SOTO:

13

The statute did ban all kinas of

16

through into Puerto Rico — as construed by the judicial

branch.

Under the construction of the

Superior Court, your client could run items in

publications in the United States if it's circulated in

Puerto Rico?

MS. SOTO:

Yes, under the construction of the

Court, yes.
QUESTION:

In other woras, if the ban is

limited to local media?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MS. SOTO:

Correct, under the construction.

2

Now, the facts of this case are clearly -- I'm

3

familiar with it, but to go briefly through them,

4

Posadas was fined for the first time when a supplement

5

was published in the San Juan Star, an article about

6

annexing the Laguna Viing to its already facilities, and

7

there was an ad placed by our union, our casino union,

8

that contained no message about promoting the casino,

9

but that included the word "casino" as its trade name

10
11

and a little drawing about a roulette in the background.
Tourism understood that was casino

12

advertising, and it warned -- Tourism warned Posadas

13

that it was violating the law.

14

reply from Posadas, a fine was imposed on the company.

15

Because it did not get a

This interpretation was immediately challenged

16

by Posadas, but while a ruling was pending the gaming

17

director wrote a letter to the president, then, that was

18

stationed in Missouri, informing about the violations in

19

the operations in Puerto Rico.

20

to answer , but used stationery that had the word

21

"casino" on it, and since the government understood that

22

the word "casino" on letterhead is also advertising, a

23

second fine was imposed on Posadas.

24
25

The president was quick

The third fine was imposed after the ruling
came out and the ruling was upholding an absolute ban on
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

speech, ana because one of the guests that was staying

2

in the hotel had a brochure that was left in his room

3

and was handing it at the lobby, which was a public

4

facility, to the government inspector, and they thought

5

that was casino advertising also, and there was a third

6

fine that was imposed on Posadas.

7

And the fourth fine really was a public debate

8

issue where the president was holding a press conference

9

and photographic session to protest legislation that

10

proposed to ban the slot machines from Puerto Rico.
QUESTION:

11

Ms. Soto, were all four of these

12

instances after the Superior Court Judge issued his

13

ruling?

14
15
16

MS. SOTO:

Yes, Your Honor, they were all

QUESTION:

And are they all, in the views of

there.

17

your opponent, so far as you know, consistent with the

18

Superior Court's Judge's ruling?

19

MS. SOTO:

Yes.

As a result of these four

20

fines, Posadas' reputation was taintea to the extreme

21

that our system operation in Atlantic City was

22

recommended denial of a casino license because the new

23

Gaming Enforcement Division of our jurisdiction

24

understooa that Posadas was an unsuitable operator.

25

At that point, declaratory judgment was
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

sought, at that initial stage, on Paragraph 9 of the

2

complaint, that three challenges to the First,

3

Fourteenth Amendment, and due process were brought up at

4

that initial level.
In the case of the due process we did not

5

6

specify whether it was the Fifth or the Fourteenth

7

Amendment because as we understand it, this Court has

8

now decided which of the two due processes are

9

applicable to Puerto Rico, as declined in the

10

Calero-Toledo case.

11

QUESTION:

Ms. Soto, I thought the fines were

12

imposed before the Superior Court made its final

13

interpretation of the statute?

14

MS. SOTO:

That is correct.

15

QUESTION:

You just told Justice Rehnquist it

MS. SOTO:

Oh, I'm sorry.

16

was after.

17
18

you, then.

19

thought he said --

20

Before that --

No, no.

QUESTION:

I misunaerstood

The fines were imposed before.

It was my understanding that the

21

determination of the Superior Court when it in effect

22

rewrote the statute, if that's what it did, that the

23

Judge did that after all these fines he did impose?

24
25

MS. SOTO:

Yes.

These four fines, and the

fact that we were almost denied a hotel license, was

I

1

before the final
QUESTION:

2

Well, then, why shouldn't we

3

proceed with the argument over what's left of the

4

statute, rather than what happened before?
MS. SOTO:

5

These were the facts that brought

6

the case up.

7

basic proposition, we think that by the Court rewriting

8

the statute it has invaded legislative functions, and

9

our main recommendation is that this statute --

We continued then -- we have to -- as a

10

QUESTION:

Well, didn't --

11

MS. SOTO:

-- as it was is the one that should

12

be construed by this Court.
QUESTION:

13

But, aren't we bound by the

14

interpretation of the statute by the courts in Puerto

15

Rico?
MS. SOTO:

16

I don't think that has been

17

decided, Justice O'Connor.

18

to extend to Puerto Rico the protections as if it were a

19

state, which I think it's undecided up to this point -QUESTION:

20

I think if this Court agrees

If the action came from a state,

21

would we not consider as binding the interpretation of

22

the statute by the court below?
MS. SOTO:

23
24
25

local law.

I think you would in matters of

However, even -QUESTION:

Would the state cross-appeal, or

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

make a cross-tiling here about the court's

2

interpretation?

3

MS. SOTO:

No.

4

QUESTION:

No, so don't we" -- shouldn't we

5

just follow the ruling of the court below as a matter of

6

local law?
MS. SOTO:

7

I don't think so, Your Honor,

8

because the state deference will not preclude the Court

9

-- this Court's role as the final arbiter of the Federal

10

Constitution, when it means the invalidation of a

11

statute.
QUESTION:

12

But all Justice O'Connor is asking

13

about is the matter of how the statute is intended to

14

read.

MS. SOTO:

15
16

We have to take the word of the Superior Court.
Not if it clashes with the

Constitution of the United States.
QUESTION:

17

No, no, but as to how broadly the

18

statute sweeps.

There, we would defer to the Superior

19

Court, would we not?
MS. SOTO:

20

If this Court decides to defer,

21

yes.

I just bring the proposition because I don't think

22

that has been decided yet, so the proposition was that

23

in one case you would go and interpret it directly,

24

yourselves, you do give it state -- status, as is, it's

25

still unconstitutional..

point.

prohibits the use of the word "casino"?

Is it correct that even after the judge rewrote

is still prohibited.

One of the incidents was being

11

fined, as I understand it, for this press conference

12

with the black ribbon across the slot machines and so

13

forth, and the wora "casino" appeared in the story.

14

Would that fine have been imposed under the statute as

15

reconstrued, or --

I think so, because that's

17

precisely why I brought the example of a recent case

that happened just this December.

20

and even after this Court had grantea jurisdiction, or

21

construed jurisdiction at least until the merits -- they

22

are still construing the statute that if it's aaaressea

23

to the public of Puerto Rico it's prohibited, and here

24

we are talking about a supplement that was in English.

25

That was after the

fifth of the tourists that come to Puerto Rico staying

in hotels, and of those that stay in hotels only 60 to

70 percent stay in hotels with casinos.
So, our market out there in Puerto Rico, of

to juggle, how to get to the tourists without getting to

On the jurisdictional question which this

Court would have me address, a facial attack on Section

8 was properly raised at every level of the proceeding,

15

initially in the complaint, Paragraph 9 as stated, and

16

throughout in the Notice of Appeal, Motion for

17

Rehearing, and the Court acknowledged that in his own

18

opinion when he said that the First, Fifth and

19

Fourteenth Amendments were applicable to the question at

bar.

21

Ana, there are no independent state grounds

22

for dismissal, expressed, at least on the merits -- on

23

the face of the judgment below, but rather that the

24

Court dismissed the case for lack of a substantial

25

question, which is a decision on the merits and

to this Court.
Due to the time limitations we will rest on

our briefs, on the rest of the jurisdictional questions,

unless there is some concern of this Court, and we will

move on to the substantiality of the question, which we

7

think is very substantial as it abriages, first,

8

commercial speech rights, it establishes a

9

subclassification of casinos versus other legalized

10

gaming.

11

The classification is more suspect because it

12

is a content based classification on speech, and it has

13

raised now that the opinion below has come out of a

14

secona classification of residents versus non-resiaents,

15

in addition of intruding into core speech rights because

16

of its overbreaath and vagueness, violated due process

guarantees.
The judgment below did not put to rest the

18
19

issues.

20

the ban itself and whether the government has met the

21

burden that at least the Central Hudson test has imposed

when abridgement of first commercial speech rights are

involved.

Whether the government has had a substantial

interest is kind of vague, because the government has

adavnced five substantial interests up to this point,

two in the original complaint which was that the

7

tourists would be protected from the patronizing of the

residents of the casino, which we fail to see how that

could be, and also that the Puerto Rico residents would

not promote tourism and do not contribute revenues to

1

The main issue here is the validity of a

2

statute that restricts the advertising of casino

3

gambling in Puerto Rico, and the first question that we

4

must address is the scope of the restriction.

5

appellant is attacking here before this Court the

6

statute, the 23-word statute, not the statute as it was

7

interpreted by the Superior Court.

Now,

8

And, of course, that is the wrong approach

9

because what the statute means must be determined by

10

what the Superior Court decided that it means, and that

11

interpretation is binding upon this Court as it has been

12

decided by many, many precedents applicable to states,

13

which are perfectly applicable to the Puerto Rico

That is the question, precise

20

question, that must be addressed in the first instance.

21

And what is left may be described as follows:

addressed to residents of Puerto Rico would be allowed

24

in general, when published in the local media.

residents if residents are clients of the hotel, not

QUESTION:

Even though 99 percent of the

Now, the advertisement -- the prohibition of

local residents, the prohibition to visit or to gamble

2

interpretation?
MR SALDANA:

3

It does not concern Posaaas at

all.

another company, which is related to Posadas.
QUESTION:

All right, and for what activity is

it?
MR SALDANA:

8
9

Posadas --

The advertising appeared in a

newspaper when the New San Juan Hotel was opened, and

10

the New San Juan Hotel has a casino and they published a

11

35-page supplement in a newspaper about the wonderful

12

new casino and all of its facilities, and one of the

13

pages was an advertisement describing in detail the

14

gaming facilities, how many tables, gaming tables they

15

were, what the roulettes were, what the card games

16

available there were, and that it was the best casino in

17

all the world.

18

And then, they published a picture --

19

QUESTION:

And would it have been all right if

20

they had added in it that local residents shouldn't read

21

it?

Then it would have been all right, in your view?
MR SALDANA:

22

In my view, if that advertisement

23

had been addressed to tourists exclusively, there would

24

be no prohibition.

25

limited.

But the point is that it was not so

The advertisement was addressed to everybody.
28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Now, the Court in its interpretation not only

2

permitted advertising to residents if they are within

3

the hotel premises, but permitted advertising to

4

residents by all sorts of souvenirs, match boxes, and

5

other such devices, publicity devices, that freely

6

circulate between residents or among residents.

7

The Court also permitted advertisements in

8

local magazines which are for -- mainly for distribution

9

to tourists, but if -- the Court said they reach the

10
11

hands of residents, that doesn't make them legal.
Then it excluded completely all advertising

12

outside the jurisdiction of Puerto Rico.

13

referring now to the question that was put by Mr.

14

Justice Powell a while ago, advertising that is

15

published in the New York Times which circulates in

16

Puerto Rico every day, we buy it every day and we read

17

it and a lot of persons read it.

That is --

Not only in that -- that was just an example,

19

but in any magazine like Time Magazine or Newsweek or

20

any other magazine in the United States.

21

QUESTION:

I suppose that would be rather

22

expensive advertising for one community to have to

23

advertise in a national publication in order to

24

distribute locally, wouldn't it?

25

MR SALDANA:

lack of a substantial constitutional question is

is like an affirmance by this Court of a judgment when

way.

QUESTION:

The reasoning?

19

MR SALDANA:

Yes.

The problem, Your Honor,

20

with the jurisdictional matter here, which I should

perhaps have addressed first, is that this is an appeal

22

that comes from the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico and the

But, the specific challenge to the validity of

18

the statute, to the authority to enact the statute, was

19

never made before the Superior Court and was never made

20

before the Supreme Court either.

21

Now, the Supreme Court appeal, we have argued,

22

was also untimely because it was filed too late, and the

reply brief that appellant has filed is very

24

significant, in my judgment.

the appellee's briel.
It merely states, as a naked statement, that

2
3

the appellees' claim was properly presented, and then it

4

goes on to beg the indulgence of this Court, that the

5

appellant was pressed for time, that the appellant

6

decided at the very last moment to file an appeal before

7

the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, and that that was why

8

it didn't make things -- it didn't do properly the

9

appeal.
It didn't raise the constitutional issues as

10
11

it should have done.

But unfortunately for the

appellant, as we all know, jurisdictional requirements

cannot be dispensed with and cannot be waived.

things, but if he didn't do it then there is no

Now, the -- going to the merits, I would like

17
18

to state in simple terms our position.

The main

19

position of the appellees in this case is that First

20

Amendment protection should not be extended under the

21

commercial free speech doctrine to advertising of casino

22

gambling.

23

Ano the reasons in support of that position

24

are in brief, that gambling and casino gambling is an

25

activity that is harmful to the community, that it is a
36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

vice-strewn activity, ana that Puerto Rico should have

2

the power to legalize casino gambling if it believes

3

that, for example, it is unwise or impractical to

4

prohibit it altogether because people will gamble

5

anyway, or because it expects to derive some economic

6

benefit from the legalization of casino gambling, but

7

that there should be no requirement that then Puerto

8

Rico should allow casinos, to promote and to actively

9

advertise and market their services ana their products

10
11

so as to create new gamblers.
And the same would apply, I would suppose, to

12

the marijuana case that was put by Justice O'Connor,

13

because a state is allowed to legalize marijuana but it

14

is prohibited from telling people, "Don't advertise

15

marijuana," then new persons who consume marijuana will

16

be encouraged to do it.

17

I mean, it's not -- the state will not be able

18

to limit the legalization to what the existing demand

19

for marijuana or gambling or casino gambling is at the

20

time that it is legalized.

21

In our case, the situation is very, very

22

difficult because there's no doubt that casino gambling

23

is a very dangerous activity, that it attracts and has

24

attracted, in Nevada and Atlantic City, it has attracted

25

the crime gamblers.

It has attracted organized crime,

and provoked a host ot other problems concerning law and

2

order including among others the corruption of

3

government officials, as the Abscam investigation showed

4

in Atlantic City where the senior Senator, federal

5

Senator was involved in taking bribes.
QUESTION:

6

Mr. Saldana, may I ask you another

7

question about the procedure in this case.

The judgment

8

of the trial court ends with the statement, "These

9

guidelines may be amended in the future by the enforcing

10

agency pursuant to the dictates of the changing needs

11

and in accordance with the law and what is resolved

12

herein."
And, I would just like to get your views on,

13
14

how firmly can we rely on what the trial judge has done

15

here as a definite rule for the future, if he says --

16

winds up by saying the enforcing agency can change the

17

rules?

18

MR SALDANA:

Well, I interpret that, Your

19

Honor, to mean that the enforcing agency can change —

20

can adopt new rules as to things that are not decided in

21

the opinion, but the Court was not telling the enforcing

22

agency, "You can change my judgment," because they it

23

would be a nullity.

24

QUESTION:

25

But he says, "These guide

regulations may be amended in the future."

MR SALDANA:

1

Well, yes, I interpret that, that

2

they may be amended to include new things, to make new

3

provisions, but that the judgment it renders, the

4

declaratory judgment, is ot course valid and binding

5

between appellant and the tourism company.

6

QUESTION:

I see.

7

MR SALDANA:

Now, we -- going back to the

8

merits, the issue here is simple in a sense.

If Puerto

9

Rico cannot prohibit the marketing and advertising of

10

casino gambling, then it is faced with a tremendous

11

problem because the experience in Nevada and Atlantic

12

City shows that when you open up the floodgates of

13

advertising and promotion, the casinos, the gambling

14

casinos take over.
They take over as in Nevada where the

15
16

principal industry is casino gambling.

17

because they exercise such a tremendous influence.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR SALDANA:

Why not get rid of casino gambling?

believe that Puerto Rico would find it preferable to ban

completely casino gambling rather than let them

So that, if this Court decides that we cannot

1

points made by brother counsel, one on the

2

jurisdictional question.

3

the challenge that the question was not raisea properly

4

and that it was a last-minute thought to bring a facial

5

attack.

It's completely meritorious,

It was brought properly.

6

There are specific

7

references in your record that it was brought in the

8

Complaint, in the Notice of Appeal, in the Motion of

9

Rehearing, plus in the Declaratory Judgment.
It particularly reads: "The juagment itself

10
11

will hereby declare that Section 8 of the law is not

12

conlusive [inauaible] from its face, and is sustained.

13

There was a facial attack right from the very beginning

14

and right on, and the constitutional -- by number,

15

First, Fifth and Fourteenth, recognized by the trial

16

court as being properly raised, with regards to the

17

merits.

18

What is left of the judgment below opinion is

19

unconstitutional, because as Justice Stevens very well

20

brought out, and I have it on my notes, before I

21

couldn't cover it, this opinion is subject to change.

22

Ana not only is it subject to change, it was going to be

23

changed this year.

24
25

This very year it was going to be changea by
the Tourism Company to include only the paragraph A

which is the proscription that Posadas or any other

2

gambling casino would advertise to the public in Puerto

3

Rico, without including all the other exceptions the

4

Board haa made, and it can be done at any minute because

5

the Court contemplatea the possibility, that if if was

6

regulated, as it was -- certain regulatory functions,

7

they could not take them all together from the Agency

8

and the Agency could change these regulations any time

9

it saw fit.

10

So, therefore, all channels of communications

11

to the residents are still closed, they are foreclosed,

12

an the section in the paragraph -- in the article that

13

was published, which by the way it is the same company

14

that manages both hotels, Posadas Hotels and the El San

15

Juan Hotel, proves that the content of this article is

16

not enticing the people to come and gamble in the

17

casino, and it is not paid publicity, which is what the

18

Judge held.
It is an article covering all sorts of things

19

20

including job opportunities, and the people that we want

21

to employ and where do we recruit them.
