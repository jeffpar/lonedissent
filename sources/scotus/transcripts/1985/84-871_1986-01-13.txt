2

Then in 1983 the Commission took a new

3

position.

4

that the Act as originally written not only allowed but

5

required preemption, and tnat even if its new reading of

6

the Act was inaccurate, it still could preempt because a

failure to do so would frustrate the implementation of

So it told the states to base local rates on

11

its perception of the correct way to depreciate and to

12

account for the costs in plant which are assigned to the

13

states under the long accepted separations principle.

14

depreciation. Your Honor.
Now, having developed this percentage,

you then

1

simply apply that to tha capital assat and derive

2

specific dollar and cent depreciation charges to recover

3

each year.

4

The fundamental flaw with the FCC’s position

5

that it is able to preempt and able to set local

6

depreciation charges is that each of these three

7

functions, each tool involved in this task has been

8

denial the FCC by Congress.

9

First, let’s look

at valuation.

Section 213 of

10

the Communications Act empowers the FCC to value plant,

11

but Section 213(h) expressly and aneguivocally provides

12

that the states retain the power to value the plant which

13

is under their jurisdiction.

14

So, certainly if the FCC cannot dictate to the

15

states tie value of the plant which is subject, to

16

intrastate regulation, than

17

specific depreciation accruals which are designed to

18

reimburse companies for the value of that plant.

19

they can’t dictate the

In other words, the FCC order assumes unto

20

itself a power expressly denied it by Section 213(h).

21

Let’s look at the other two functions, classification of

22

the property and the development of these specific

23

depreciation percentages to apply to the property’s

24

value.

25

Well, the government, the FCC argues that

Section 220(b) of the Act, and that is the general

2

depreciation and accounting section, gives them the

3

authority not only to set up classifications and these

4

specific depreciation percentages for the plant under

5

their jurisdiction,

6

to set up classifications and percentages for the plant

7

and the assets uniar the state's jurisdiction and

8

authority.

9

that they never took from 1 934 to 1 983, and that the

11

but it also gives them the authority

That is the new reading.

That is the reading

Fourt Circuit was not willing to embrace.
But they argue that Section 220(b) expressly

12

authorizes them to take over these two functions, but

13

when one reads Section 220 in its full context, with

14

particular reference to Section 220(j), one sees that

15

Congress did not give them the authority to classify

16

plant or to develop depreciation percentages with respect

17

to the plant in the state's jurisdiction.

18

Now, of course, this is —

called for a study to look, into the reasonableness of

was dual regulation with the states regulating these

Now, when you ha/e got a telephone pole out

10

there that has wires on it that are used both for

intrastate and interstate, do you say that that section

12

means that you allocate a part of that pole to intrastate

service ?

14

HR. MALONE:

Yes,

Your Honor, but I think

Congress has always recognized. Your Honor,

QUESTION;

to take

Did tne Commission then allow the

11

states or did it follow the states" methods when it came

12

to depreciating for interstate communications service?

13

SR. MALONE;

Kell, for interstate

14

communications services, the Commission eventually grew

15

into a position where it was'able to develop its cwn

16

depreciation charges with respect to the costs that were

17

separated to it.

18

Let's assume we have a telephone pole t.iat

19

costs 5100, and we assume that 75 percent of that pole's

20

usage is devoted to intrastate services and 25 percent is

21

devoted to interstate.

22

states responsibility for dealing with the $75 on that

23

pole, and the FCC is responsible for dealing with the

other $25.

What we do is, we assign the

to that provision is, do these terms,

But how does the FCC — how does it answer

12

these claims?

13

Well, the Fourth Circuit did not give a great deal of

14

attention to the law because it went on to Section 151

15

and the implied preemption theory.

16

How did the Fourth Circuit answer them?

But on appeal, the respondents have argued

that

19

and therefore rfooli refer to Section 220, and although

20

Section 152 uses the very same terms as appear in Section

21

220, they argue that it has no relevance to depreciation

22

accounting.

23

although by its express design it refers

They claim that the terms charges,

fact that that statute uses very different language than

2

Congress had intended to just refer to rites for

It says that the FCC cannot assert jurisdiction

over charges, classifications, and practices for or in

Their position also in claiming that it has no

reference to 220 and simply refers to rate structure

11

attributes extreme redundancy to Congress by assuming

12

that Congress used six terms to mean one.

13

£ith respect to Section 220(g), and that is the

14

provision again which calls for a study by the FCC to

15

look into the reasonableness of harmonizing state and

16

federal powers over depreciation, they argued that that

17

provision was nothing more than a paraphrase of the

I8

Senate pro-preemption 220(j).

19

But again,

that statute belies their position,

20

because it calls for the harmonization of state and

2

the Fourth Circuit was still willing to preempt,

3

did so by reasoning that even though this increase or

local rates, that is still justified because it is going

to further general responsibilities found in Section

But that sort of reasoning, as the low«>r court
dissent indicated, really allows an agency to overreach

with its general purpose language.

11

to hold general purpose language such as 151, which

12

really has no legislative history to it, and simply tells

13

the FCC, go and regulate interstate matters, to hold that

14

language up to the light and to manipulate it until it is

15

able to derive a stream of unstated purposes which are

really pceissigned to conflict with the state law to be

points out that that rate increase, which the Department
of Defense indicated below would not be justified and
wouldn't really serve any purpose, would have the effect
of causing business customers to try to get off the
network, and that would lead to investment which was out
there — it wouldn't be serving anybody — called
stranded investment, which would force other rates
upward.

You would have a spiraling effect,

self-perpetuating, which would then force other people
off the system, all based upon the FCC's application of a
broad brush to a set of circumstances really requiring a
fine stroke.
We may have competition out there.

with that in the development of depreciation charges, but

that you do in Houston, and it is the regulators in those

are best able to evaluate this competition and

determine its effect on depreciation lives.

increased rates, and

that would be deleterious to the

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PARTIES
MR. FRIED*

Thank

you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

7

may it please the Court, I should first begin by making a

penny a day per customer, and there is no reason to

suppos e that Maryland is unusual in this respect.

I wool d like to just set tne predicate for it, and then

Well, perhaps my brother, Mr.

Boudin, can assist on some of these matters, but I do

want to call the Court’s attention to the findings of the

Court of Appeals in the Maryland case, because there

11

there is a specific finding which brings the matter down

12

to the effect on consumers.

13

Now, we are talking about the physical

14

integrity and the modernity and the financial soundness

15

of the very channels of interstate communication, and

16

what depreciation is about is paying for physical

very important.

mandate to make available to all the people of the United

But here, unlike sone other cases the court has
had to consider, there is no setting of the state’s
regulatory agenda, no mandating of state procedures, as

one Justice has put it, no kidnapping of the state

procedures at all, just the familiar instance of federal

what about all the other elements, such as rate of

Could you take over those as well?
»R. FFIEDt

MR. FRIED*

I think that what happened —
And why not?
What happened was, in the first --

4

the first depreciation order, the one which -- where the

5

Commission has departed from that, they assume that the

6

states would go along, and there had been this kind of

7

collaboration.

What happen ed, and this is set out in Footnote
14 of Paragraph 37 of the FCC's order, to their surprise,

10

for the first time 14 states refused to follow them on

11

one element of the depreciation order, and nine on

12

another.

13

14

existed until this time.

15

So, for the first time, the FCC was faced with
a confrontation which had not

question, because I think it is an important one, there

17

is a big difference between depreciation cn one hand and

18

these rate design juestions on the other.

19

QUESTION!

Yes, I would suppose that one could

20

argue that rate of return is somethin? of national

21

interest, and on a nationwide basis the federal agents

22

would he best able to value what tne money market was for

23

the whole country, and therefore be thoroughly justified

24

in saying the rate of return ought to be 12 percent

25

rather than 5 percent.

is depreciation is a fact in the world.

11

It is not really

When you decide whether you are going tc have

It is nevertheless the clearest around for

why I

That statutory language, Section 220(b),

was

taken virtually verbatim from Section 220(5) of the

Interstate Commerce Act enacted in 1920.

It listened to a lot of testimony cn it,
including explanations that it would be a deviation from
the existing law, and the sponsors of that amendment, the
Rouse report. Congressman Rayburn, said that it would be
a change in the axistin larf if that reservation were
adopted, and Congress refused to adopt it.
The Pacific Gas and Electric case was mentioned
earlier.

Justice «Jhite at Page 22'J of that case pointed

out that it is an improper construction of a federal
statute to read it as embodying a statement which
Congress considered and specifically refused to enact,
and that is exactly what the states are requesting here.
They are asking you to read Section 220 as if Congress
passed a provision about which it considered specifically
and refused to enact it.

T think

We
the

1

history is very clear.

2

Justices Rehnquist and Stevens asked, is it not

3

true that accountants have differed over depreciation and

4

accounting.

5

FCC, and the FCC admits that at Page 23 of the joint

6

appendix, where it says there is no right or wrong to

7

depreciation, and the suggestion by the telephone

8

industry here today that unless there is one regulator

9

setting depreciation charges, we won't have accurate

The answer is clearly yes, and so has the

10

depreciation xs belied not only by the FCC's statement at

11

Page 23 of the joint appendix, which it made before

12

attempting to preempt, but also the fact that there are a

13

number of telephone companies who are not here today.

14

Part of the Bell System, Pacific Telephone and

15

Telegraph, they are not supporting this preemption case,

16

because in those states the FCC is setting rates faster -■

QUESTIONS

Didn't Mr. Boudin say to us that all

18

of the telephone companies were in suppert of this

position?

They absolutely are not in support

QUESTION*

9

It is not accurate

it is money.
Then when you refer to the telephone

industry, it isn't the entire industry.

10

MB. MALONE*

Hell, as far as Hr. Boudin is not

11

representing the telephone iniustry, that is correct.

12

is representing the telephone companies which have

13

supported the FCC.

QUESTION;

Well, are there any who have not

appeared here --

HR. HALONE:

Oh, yes.

Affirmatively supporting your

HR. HALONE;

Any telephone companies supporting

would go quite that far.

No, there are not, Tour

That wouli be heresy.

I ion't think that they

MR. MfiLOtfEj

Your Honor, with respect to

3

valuation, there is no question that the cannot tell the

4

statas how to accrue specific depreciation charges

5

without telling them the valuation of the assets that are

6

at issue.

7

would ba a very difficult rase to take over valuation,

8

but yet that is precisely what they are trying to do, and

9

I would refer you to Page 35 of the FCC’s brief.

They seem to concede indirectly that that

10

2UESri3M;

Why would it be such a difficult

11

case?

12

specifically says the Commission may prescribe forms of

13

any and all accounts.

14

literally

Why would it be sun a difficult case?

220(a)

Why can’t they just do that

>

MR. MRLQKE*

15

Because 213(h),

the valuation

16

statute, says that the states have th.e right to set

17

valuation.

18

Your Honor, witn respect to the final point,

19

which is whether there are in fact two hands on the

20

wheel, and whether our position is the same as that which

21

has bean rejected oy the lower courts with respect to

22

Section 152(b) in the past,

23

position.

24

touching those opinions at all, because we are dealing

25

here with joint costs which have been separated and are

it is clearly not the same

You can uphold this in this case without
