PROCEEDINGS

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The Court will hear arguments

3

first this morning in Three Affiliated Tribes against Wold

4

Engineering Company.

5

Mr. Cross, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RAYMOND CROSS, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. CROSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

10

This matter is before this Court for the second time

11

on a Writ of Certiorari

12

Dakota.

13

to the Supreme Court of North

This case squarely presents the issue left undecided

14

by this Court in its previous decision in this matter.

15

issue is whether a state may enact a statute barring tribal

16

Indians but not non-Indians, from state court for hearing damage

17

actions against non-Indian defendants in state court.

18

That

Respondent, Wold Engineering, urges this Court to

19

uphold the state statute that bars all tribal Indians residing

20

on the four Reservations in North Dakota from access to state

21

court for the enforcement of their damages actions against

22

non-Indians.

23

This Court previously held in this matter that such

24

a state statute is not required nor authorized by federal law,

25

particularly Public Law 280, as a measure to protect the tribal

1

Indians in the area of their rights.

2

The facts of this case are simple.

This case

3

involves a breach of contract and negligence action for

4

damages brought by the Three Affiliated Tribes against Wold

5

Engineering, a non-Indian firm in North Dakota.

6

This action arose on the Fort Berthold Indian

7

Reservation.

8

with Wold Engineering to design and build a water supply system

9

known as the Four Bears Water Supply System on the Fort Berthold

In 1974, the Three Affiliated Tribes contracted

10

Reservation.

11

pleted, the Tribes discovered that the project failed to supply

12

a safe and continuous water supply to the portion of the

13

Reservation people it was intended to serve.

14

However, in 1977, after the project was com­

Despite efforts at correction by Wold Engineering,

15

the project never functioned properly and in 1980 the Three

16

Affiliated Tribes commenced this action in the State District

17

Court for the Northwest Judicial District of North Dakota.

18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

The trial court, upon Wold's motion, dismissed the
Tribes'

complaint, holding that actions arising on the

Indian reservations in North Dakota brought by tribal members
cannot be enforced against non-Indian defendants.
In 1982, the North Dakota Supreme Court affirmed
the trial court's judgment and held that actions arising on
the reservations and brought by tribal Indians against
non-Indians cannot be heard in state court because of a state

disclaimer known as the Indian Civil Jurisdiction Act of 1963,

2

as well as the influence of Public Law 280 ousted the state

3

court from subject matter jurisdiction.

4

This Court granted the Tribe the first petition for

5

Certiorari and after hearing reversed — pardon me, vacated

6

the judgment of the North Dakota Supreme Court, holding that

7

Public Law 280 neither authorized nor required such a

8

jurisdictional bar to tribal Indians' access to state court.

9

Further, the Supreme Court, this Court, remanded

10

the case for further proceedings in light of the Supreme Court's

11

holding that this matter should be scrutinzed by the court

12

below for possible constitutional infirmities and further that

13

Chapter 27-19 was not authorized by Public Law 280 or any other

14

federal law as a jurisdictional disclaimer of subject matter

15

jurisdiction in this category of actions.

16

The court below on remand held that the matter of

17

state law alone, that Indians, tribal Indians, residing on

18

the reservation were barred from maintaining these actions.

19

The reason for this barrier arises from the state jurisdictional

20

statute, known as the Indian Civil Jurisdiction Statute of

21

1963, and that this state law alone barred the tribal Indians

22

access to state court in these cases.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. CROSS:

25

Unless —
Unless, Justice, the consent to the full

extension — that is unless the tribal Indians either

1

collectively as a tribal group or individually consent to the

2

full extension of state civil jurisdiction over the pertinent

3

property.

4

The only exception to this extension would be that

5

the state court's power to levy and execute on tribal property

6

may be exempted by state or federal law.

7

8
9

QUESTION:

And, the waiver

the condition is not

only for this case, but for all cases?
MR. CROSS:

That is right.

The waiver would have

10

the jurisdictional effect of conferring general judicial jurisdicti

11

on the court for all cases.

12

consenting Indian was a tribal government or whether the Indian

13

was an individual seeking to pursue a damage action in state

14

court, Justice.

15

QUESTION:

That would be true whether the

Would you have the same objection if the

16

state conditioned its consent to use its courts just to the

17

waiver of any objection to proceedings in connection with that

18

particular case; for example, a counterclaim and making the

19

tribe subject to discovery orders and contempt sanctions and

20

so forth, in connection with the particular case?

21

MR. CROSS:

Justice O'Connor, as we conceded in this

22

Court in the previous hearing in this matter, the Three Affiliated

23

Tribes would be subject to the counterclaim of the Respondent,

24

Wold Engineering, up to the extent of jurisdictional

25

QUESTION:

I thought you said as a setoff, but not —

MR. CROSS:

2

QUESTION:

3

-- as a counterclaim that would result in

additional liability.

4

MR. CROSS:

5

QUESTION:

6

As a setoff.

That is right, Your Honor.
How about the discovery procedures and

so forth?

7

MR. CROSS:

The Three Affiliated Tribes believe it

8

would be proper in the interest of justice that they would

9

be subject to discovery proceedings and to proceedings that

10

would insure a fair trial to the non-Indian defendants.

11

QUESTION:

Well, could the state adopt a statute

12

just requiring consent by the tribe to jurisdiction for all

13

purposes in connection with that particular suit?

14

be valid?

15

MR. CROSS:

Would that

I think, Your Honor, if the statute had

16

the purpose of insuring that a fair trial would be provided

17

to the non-Indian defendant and that if the plaintiff, the

18

tribe, would not conform to such requirements, then, I think,

19

yes, the state court would be entitled to institute that suit

20

in the interest of justice.

21

QUESTION:

Mr. Cross, in this case, are there any

22

individual Indians who are plaintiffs or is it just the Three

23

Affiliated Tribes?

24

MR. CROSS:

25

QUESTION:
•

Just the Three Affiliated Tribes.
Then these tribes themselves have refused

n,r!p»c,^A

7

mr:3A'r»iri\'r

■

\f

nir

1

to consent to state court jurisdiction?
MR. CROSS:

2

The consent issue did not finally become

3

crystallized until the final decision by the North Dakota Supreme

4

Court.

5

under state law prior to the decision in Wold II, that the

6

consent did not bar tribal Indians, including tribal governments,

7

from suing non-Indians in state court.

8

Supreme Court took a second look at the jurisdictional effect

9

of the state statute that they held that the intent was to

In other words, the presumption had been, and it appeared

It was after the State

10

completely bar tribal Indians, including suits against non-Indian;

11

for the enforcement of damages.

12

QUESTION:

But, at any rate, it is clear that if

13

Wold Engineering had wanted to sue the Three Affiliated Tribes

14

in the state court, it could not have done that?

15

MR. CROSS:

16

QUESTION:

That is correct.
Suppose in this case the tribes comes

17

into sue for breach of contract, for failure to perform, and

18

Wold says we didn't fail anything, we performed and now we

19

are counterclaiming for the amount you promised us for building

20

this structure or whatever it was.

21

for Wold that they didn't breach the contract and that the

22

tribe owes them something.

23

consent to the counterclaim would permit that judgment to be

24

entered against them?

25

MR. CROSS:

Suppose the court finds

4
5

So, your answer is, yes, that judgment

MR. CROSS:

The counterclaim can be heard up to the

extent of a recoupment or equitable setoff.

QUESTION:

Well, there isn't any equitable setoff.

Wold just wins the case supposedly.

8

9

At least that is your view of tribal

immunity.

14
15

Wold doesn't

immunity as it now stands, Justice.

12

13

No breach.

MR. CROSS:

Yes, that is our view of the doctrine

as explained by this Court.

16

QUESTION:

And, you would say that even if that is

17

the case, the state could not dismiss the action in the first

18

place?

19

You would say the state would not be permitted to say

to the tribe, now, look, if you want to file this complaint

20

and have us entertain it, you must waive your immunity with

21

respect to the counterclaim.

22
23
24
25

MR. CROSS:

If a state statute was drafted that

narrowly and it had that purpose and intent to make sure that
the tribal governments were subject to counterclaims, then
that would present a different issue.
9

Here the court below —

QUESTION:

1

2

Well, it may present a different issue, but

how would you resolve it?

3

MR. CROSS:

I believe that that requirement, requiring

4

the tribes to waive their tribal sovereign immunity is the

5

bases for maintaining a damage of action should not be allowed

6

under the present doctrine of tribal sovereignity.

7

8

QUESTION:

So, in your view, the state could not

dismiss the action for failure to waive the counterclaim?

9

MR. CROSS:

That is correct.

10

The statute that we have here —

11

QUESTION:

Suppose a state has a provision that any

12

non-resident must post a bond before filing an action.

13

that apply to your case if they had such a statute?

14

MR. CROSS:

Would

If that statute was applied to non­

15

residents and required such a posting to make sure that the

16

case could be conducted fairly, then I think they may be able

17

to do that, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CROSS:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. CROSS:

They could do that?
Yes.
You would have no objection.
The statute at issue here bars all tribal

22

Indians,

23

court.

24

for insurance of fairness to the non-Indian defendant, such

25

as the doctrine of forum non conveniens, the tribe would have

not just tribal governments, from access to state
If there were provisions of that statute which provided

x

1

no objection to administration, court administration of justice,

2

that made sure that the adjudication of the non-Indians' claim

3

as against tribal Indians and individuals was fair.

4

However, when a state statute completely bars all

5

of the tribal Indians, regardless of the merits of the claim,

6

regardless of whether issues of sovereign immunity are

7

directly presented by the case or not, then such a state

8

statute, I believe, is overbroad and the reason why it is over­

9

broad is because it interferes with basic rights of due process,

10

it interferes with equal protection of the laws.

11

Tribal Indians were recognized in 1957, under the

12

state decision known as Vermillion v. Spotted Elk, to have

13

the right of access under the open courts provision of the

14

state Constitution and under state judicial precedent to sue

15

for the enforcement of damages action in state court.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Cross, you used the term "overly broad."

17

That is something we ordinarily use in the First Amendment

18

context.

19

here than in the particular application of the state statute

20

of the facts of this case where you are not dealing with any

21

individual Indians who are trying to sue, you are dealing with

22

a tribe which is trying to sue and the tribe itself has withheld

23

its consent?

24
25

Is there any reason for this Court to go any further

MR. CROSS:

The reason, Justice Rehnquist, that I

think this Court should go further and examine the case of
11

1

individual Indians is because if this statute is allowed to

2

stand as construed, will bar in the future until the statute

3

is either amended or rescinded all tribal Indians from access

4

to state court.

5

QUESTION:

We have adopted that approach in the First

6

Amendment, that overbreadth approach that you say, that if

7

a state court adopts a very broad construction of a statute,

8

that interferes with First Amendment rights, a person who could

9

have gotten it under a narrow construction could still challenge

10

it.

11

Amendment in that area and certainly this is just a straight

12

Indian law case.

But, I don't believe we have gone outside of the First

13

MR. CROSS:

I believe that this is an equal protection

14

and due process case as well in that the rights of the tribal

15

people

16

now been taken away from them, not just tribal governments,

17

not just a reasonable constraint on the exercise of —

had to maintain damages actions in state court have

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. CROSS:

But, your clients aren't individual Indians.
I think it is even more compelling in

20

this case, Justice, because the Indian tribe acts on behalf

21

of its tribal people.

22

If the access to state court for the reasonable

23

enforcement of their damages claim is completely taken away,

24

it is not just the tribe per se that is going to suffer, but

25

the individuals as well.
12

1

QUESTION:

Do you think your case is stronger if

2

you can bring in the rights of individual Indians as opposed

3

to just the right of your own client?

4

MR. CROSS:

I think the case is stronger in the sense

5

that the construction of the state statute bars all tribal

6

plaintiffs and if the statute stands it will continue to bar

7

the plaintiffs in the future.

8
9

The reason why I think that the tribal government
should be able to assert those rights and to bring that focus

10

to the scope of the statute is because the tribal government

11

is a representative of the Indian people and many times has

12

the only wherewithall to challenge statutes such as these that

13

are unfair.

14

QUESTION:

Would you explain how the tribe and

15

non-Indian citizens are similarly situated for purposes of

16

an equal protection analysis?

17

It just seems to me they are

not the same because the tribe is not subject to the jurisdiction

18

at all of the state courts under your view, not even subject

19

to the counterclaim in this case.

20

situated for purposes of equal protection?

21

MR. CROSS:

So, how are they similarly

The tribe and Indian individuals, when

22

they filed in state court, are subject to the procedural

23

restriction, and, as I mentioned before, the reasonable

24

procedural restriction that insures a fair trial.

25

Just as the United States, when it sues in state
13
a

1

court, if they fail to comply with the restrictions that apply

2

to everyone bringing the suit and the maintaining of the suit,

3

that the case can be dismissed for those reasons.

4

The questions as I understand them today center on

5

whether or not a state court or a state could pass a statute

6

allowing the enforcement of affirmative relief against --

7

p

QUESTION:

Well, if two non-Indian parties, plaintiff

8

and defendant, were suing in the state court of North Dakota,

9

the plaintiff in the case would be subject to a suit for a

10

counterclaim in that suit by the defendant and you have told

11

us this morning again that in your view the tribe would not

12

be subject to a counterclaim --

13

MR. CROSS:

14

QUESTION:

The tribe -— and as a result they are not similarly

15

situated for purposes of equal protection analysis is how it

16

appears to me anyway.

17

MR. CROSS:

The tribe as a governmental entity is

18

similarly situation, I believe, in the sense that they are

19

willing to go into state court and be bound by all the reason­

20

able procedural restrictions, just as the United States when

21

22
23
24
25

they sue in state court will be bound.
The only difference between the tribe and the
non-Indian plaintiff that wished to sue is that the tribe,
along with all of the tribal Indians, are barred from that
court, so that we don't reach the further question of what
a

14

oiron.ai’!\ir

tavoa

vv

\r

1

sort of constraints could be placed on the tribe's appearance.

2

So, it seems to me --

3
4

QUESTION:

Well, but we do have in this case a

defendant wanting to make a counterclaim, don't we?

5

MR. CROSS:

Yes.

And, if they can maintain that

6

counterclaim, that counterclaim can be heard to the extent

7

of a recoupment or equitable —

8
9

QUESTION:

available if the defendant were not an Indian tribe.

10

MR. CROSS:

11

QUESTION:

12
13

But, not to the extent that would be

That is correct.
So, how could they be similarly situated

then?
MR. CROSS:

For purposes of equal protection, I think

14

there may be difficulties in comparing Indian tribes to

15

non-Indian plaintiffs, however, the other facet of the due

16

process claim requires the court be open on a reasonable basis.

17

The tribes are willing to go into state court and

18

be bound by all of the procedural restrictions, be bound by

19

res judicata, be bound by all of those elements that make for

20

a fair trial.

21

22
23
24
25

The only difference being is that an Indian tribe
is not a non-Indian plaintiff.

It cannot be sued except with

its consent, except to the extent for

equitable setoff or

recoupment.
QUESTION:
ai

Mr. Cross, since the case was here before,
15

m- 5<;n\ oranoT'vn rnw34^\r nr

1

has the tribe now altered its laws so that a suit would be

2

possible in tribal court today against Wold Engineering?
MR. CROSS:

3

The tribe has altered its laws and a

4

suit would be possible in the sense that the tribal code now

5

recognizes jurisdiction over non-Indians.

6

government could proceed against Wold Engineering or a party

7

like Wold Engineering in tribal court.
The problem is that the State of North Dakota in

8
9

So that the tribal

a case entitled Lowe v. Cloud does not recognize the enforce­

10

ability of tribal court judgments from state courts.

11

sequently, a situation where a non-Indian defendant is a

12

non-resident of the reservation, has no assets on the

13

reservation, there would be serious question about the efficacy

14

of such a proceeding.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

Con­

Could the tribe have sued Wold in federal

court?
MR. CROSS:

No, Your Honor.

There was a case some­

18

what similar to this called Chance v. White Lightening and

19

that involved an effort to sue, first, in federal district

20

court, in light of this decision, in light of the Wold I decision

21

in state court.

22

There, the facts involved simply a tort action, as

23

I recall, and the federal district courts, being courts of

24

limited jurisdiction, held that there was no subject-matter

25

jurisdiction.

QUESTION:

I thought there was a special section

2

of 28 that said what an Indian tribe is is a plaintiff that

3

can sue.

4

Am I wrong in that?
MR. CROSS:

Your Honor, there is a special section

5

that allows Indian tribes to sue, however, that does not address

6

the issue of subject-matter juridiction.

7

to the federal question and to other limitations on federal

8

court jurisdiction.

9

There are still subject

Consequently, if a tribe attempted to bring

10

the appropriate federal court, that they would still be subject

11

to the limitation that this question must be cognizable under

12

the judicial power the federal courts have.

13

And, as I understand it, a mere contract action,

14

a mere breach of contract action, a negligence action, would

15

not present federal questions.

16

the-mill contract action that should be appropriately heard

It would be simply a run-of-

in state court.
QUESTION:

Well, what if it was a — Federal courts

hear state law questions all the time in diversity cases.
MR. CROSS:
QUESTION:

There is no diversity here, Your Honor.
Well, there may not be, but there is a

statute that says Indians can come into court.

Why isn't that —

It may be the governing law would be state law, but why can't
the Indians come into federal court?

However, the subject —

QUESTION:

They didn't need that statute to come

into federal court on a federal question.

12

MR. CROSS:

I think in a sense that the federal

13

statute opening the federal courts to the Indian tribes

14

simply confirms existing law.

15

in cases before that statute was enacted that Indian tribes

16

have the capacity to maintain a legal action in their own

right.

20

QUESTION:

This Court has previously held

So, you say then the statute just wasn't

needed at all.
MR. CROSS:

I think the statute within the limits

2

This statute, as we have said before, excludes all

3

tribal Indians on the four reservations in North Dakota from

4

access to state court.

5

a decision entitled Vermillion v. Spotted Elk, had held that

6

Indian tribes or at least Indian individuals were entitled

7

to enforce their rights in state court.

Now, the state court previously, in

However, in 1963, the state enacted the Indian Civil
Jurisdiction Act.

That statute has been construed by the state

10

court below of barring tribal Indians from access until they

11

consent to the extension of the state civil jurisdiction over

12

their person and property on the reservation.

13

Now, this consent goes far beyond the issue at hand

It would subject the tribe and

It would also confer on the state the authority to

21

legislate in a variety of subject-matter areas in contract,

22

in divorce, in guardianships, in other areas not limited to

23

those subject-matter categories that are now presently

24

reserved to tribal regulation.

So that the design and purpose of the statute, as

construed by the court below, is to completely bar tribal Indians

2

from maintaining these actions unless they consent to the

3

extension of state civil jurisdiction for virtually all purposes,

4

the only exception being that the state may not use their

enforcement powers to levy or execute on tribal Indian

7

We believe — The tribes believe and have argued

8

in their brief that such restrictions on the civil rights of

9

tribal Indians, the restriction on due process rights of tribal

10

Indians, requires a special justification.

11

justification because the matter peaves two issues of Indian

12

ancestory and Indian identity.

It requires special

Court, in its prior decision in this matter, said that the

state statute was not required by federal law to protect the

16

rights of tribal Indians in the sense of the pre-emption

doctrine; that this statute did not require a governing federal

18

law under Public Law 280.

19

Consequently, the state statute bars a — bears a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY H. LEE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. LEE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the

Court:

5

The North Dakota legislative plan, Chapter 27-19

6

of the North Dakota Century Code, a 1963 jurisdictional act,

7

which Mr. Cross refers to, and the North Dakota Supreme Court's

8

decision in this case, and Wold Engineering, all seek precisely

9

the same thing and that is equal justice for everyone under

10
11
12
13

the law.
The current situation in North Dakota guarantees
to everyone that equal access.
Three Tribes and Mr. Cross argues here today that

14

somehow Indian litigants or tribal litigants is being denied

15

access to a court in situations where others have that access

16

and that is simply not so.

17

In the case of an Indian — In all cases, where the

18

facts are the same, the access of the litigants is the same.

19

If you have a situation of an Indian litigant against a

20

non-Indian litigant or a non-Indian litigant against an Indian

21

litigant for an off-reservation occurrence, all litigants in

22

the State of North Dakota have equal access to the state courts

23
24
25

of North Dakota.

They all have the same rights, remedies and

procedures.
In the situation of an Indian litigant against a
21

1

non-Indian litigant or a non-Indian litigant against an Indian

2

litigant, the facts that we have in this case, the state court

3

of North Dakota would impose the same jurisdictional restraints

4

and requirements on all litigants and would deny access in

5

those cases to all litigants.

6

and privileges would be available to all under North Dakota

7

law.

8
9

10

Again, the same rights, procedures ,

So, as it now stands, the North Dakota jurisdictional
plan guarantees for everyone equal justice under the law.

citizen off the reservation and both of them are lemons.

Wouldn't somebody at least say oophs,

MR. LEE:

Well, I would hope that somebody would

recognize the problem and that is a problem that has been in

6

existence in the State of North Dakota for well over 20 years

7

and everyone has known that that problem has existed, yet,

8

in that period of time, not one effort has been made to resolve

9

the problem except this case here today.

10

What Three Tribes here seeks today plain and simple

11

is unequal access to the courts of North Dakota.

12

to be able to use the courts as plaintiffs without ever having

13

to run the risk of appearing in those same courts as a

14

defendant and that is an unequal access.

15

They wish

Furthermore, the access that they seek, at least

16

in the state court in the arguments before the North Dakota

17

Supreme Court was an access which would allow them all

18

procedural protections and all procedural rights and remedies

19

and the non-Indian litigant would have none of those same

20

protections and same privileges accorded to him.
j

21

This is the first time today that Mr. Cross or the

22

attorney arguing for the Indian litigant has admitted the

23

possibility that North Dakota rules of court procedure might

24

be applicable on the reservation.

25

In the state court below, that position — a contrary
23

1

position was taken and that being that North Dakota rules of

2

court procedure would not apply against the Indian litigant.

The North Dakota decision does not deny equal

protection.

MR. LEE:

6

How do you go about collecting

At the present time, I don't believe that

7

there is a mechanism for collecting it.

8

Supreme Court in its decision stated that if the Indian people

9

were to somehow consent to state court jurisdiction, that to

10

the extent that it is allowed under federal or state policy,

11

the North Dakota court would have to -- the North Dakota

12

decision could be enforced on the reservation.

13

has not yet been fully explored.

The North Dakota

That mechanism

At the current time, I don't believe that there is

14
15

a mechanism for enforcing a judgment received against the Indian

16

tribe outside of perhaps their own courts recognizing under

17

some principle of comity the decision of the North Dakota

18

court.

19

And, I am saying that the concomitant relationship

20

would have to exist between the state courts and the people

21

on the Indian reservation.

22

is going to refuse to entertain jurisdiction on the

23

reservation, and principles of comity would require it to

24

recognize those decisions which come from the reservation

25

and give them force and effect off the reservation.

If the state court of North Dakota

28

1

The jurisdictional void has to be filled somehow.
Mr. Cross is here today arguing that the North Dakota

2
3

decision denied equal protection of the laws.

Even if the

4

Court is to somehow believe that a classification is here being

5

made, I would submit that the North Dakota jurisdictional

6

plan could still survive.
The goal of equal protection is to end a caste-based

7

8

society where classification based upon race or other

9

immutable characteristics are perpetrated and continued.
It also involves, I believe, a bit of overreaching,

10
11

a substantial amount of overreaching, by the group with the

12

political power to control and to keep in a subservient position

13

that group without political power.

14

When those facts jell and the pot is churned, then

15

you have a situation where overreaching occurs and equal

16

protection is denied to certain people.

17

The North Dakota law does not create a caste-based

18

society.

19

everyone similarly situated.

20

As it currently stands, everyone is treated the same,

Three Tribes' position in this case will, however,

21

create a caste-based society.

22

Indian litigants will be allowed to use the state forum in

23

North Dakota without ever having to appear as defendants.

24

They will also have all rules of procedure available to them,

25

while the non-Indian

It will have a situation where

litigant will have none.
29

This is a

1

caste-based society and this would be greatly unfair and would

2

violate the due process of the laws.

3
4

Secondly, the North Dakota jurisdictional plan draws
no distinction based upon race or other immutable
»

5

6

characteristics.
The disability of the Indian litigant in this case

7

comes from his tribal status and being located on the

8

reservation and those are political concerns and political

9

considerations, not necessarily racial.

10

Furthermore, if they are racial, they are not

11

immutable, because they can be removed.

12

protection case is a situation where no matter what one does

13

to try and better himself, to try to improve himself, to try

14

to change his position, he cannot do it, because the

15

legislation refuses to allow him that chance.

16

The classic equal

The North Dakota law gives the Indian people a

17

chance to remove the impediment to the state court in this

18

case and all they have to do to receive that protection is

19

simply agree to follow and obey the reasonable rules of court

20

set out in North Dakota and to obey and agree to follow the

21

22
23
24
25

reasonable rules of substantive law which have been laid out
in the State of North Dakota.
So, there is no immutable characteristic which cannot
be removed.
If that is the case, it would seem to me that the
30

1

proper standard for review on this case would be the rational

2

basis standard and if you apply the rational basis test to

3

this case, you can see that the North Dakota Supreme Court

4

enacted its legislation pursuant to authority granted by Con­

5

gress in Public Law 280.

6

Further, the people of the State of North Dakota,

7

at the time they enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act in —

8

The Indian Civil Jurisdiction Act in 1963 could have unilaterally

9

imposed all jurisdiction on the Indian people without listening

10

to them, without paying them any attention whatsoever.

11

Instead of doing that, they held legislative hearings around

12

the state and the Indian people came to those legislative

13

hearings and told the State of North Dakota stay out, we want

14

all or nothing at all jurisdiction until we ask for it.

15

And, that, I think, also destroys traditional equal protection

16

problem here in that we do not have the overreaching by the

17

group with political power.

18

In fact, we have a situation where the group that

19

had the ultimate political power was leaning backwards to try

20

and give the Indian people some self-determination and a voice

21

in their own destiny.

22

A compact or compromise was reached, if you will,

23

between the people of the State of North Dakota and the Indians

24

residing on their reservations in the State of North Dakota.

25

This subject-matter jurisdictional plan, this compact and
31

1

compromise existing between the Indian people and between the

2

State of North Dakota is now over 20 years old.

3

The Indian people in the State of North Dakota asked

4

for this jurisdictional plan and in that period of time, since

5

this jurisdictional plan was enacted, the North Dakota Supreme

6

Court has had a number of occasions to rule on the issues that

7

are before this Court today and in 1963, only about two or

8

three months after the jurisdictional plan went into effect,

9

the first case came down and in that first case the North Dakota

10

Supreme Court held that the North Dakota courts would have

11

no subject-matter jurisdiction on the Indian reservation in

12

matters involving Indian litigant.

13
14

So, for 20 years this jurisdictional setting has
been known to the Indian people.

They knew or should have

15

known that for 20 years that there would be this problem that

16

would present itself some day, yet in that 20-year period of

17

time, not once did the Indian people come to the North Dakota

18

legislature and try to rework or renegotiate a jurisdictional

19

plan that would be workable and agreeable to everyone.

20

once in that 20-year period of time did the Indian people set

21

up an election or try to poll the tribal election to see if

22

they would want to take this jurisdictional plan and not once

23

in that 20-year period of time, not until this case apparently,

24

did the Indian people act to create their own forum which would,

25

in the future, be able to control these sorts of situations.
32

Not

1

So, now, 20 years after it has been known to them,

2

they try to come through the backdoor of the courthouse, while

3

at the same time denying all other litigants access to the

4

front door of the courthouse.

5

The solution to this case exists in the North Dakota

6

law and it is a political solution that should be worked out

7

through political compromise between the Indian people and

8

the State of North Dakota.

9

Congress envisioned in Public Law 280.

That was the situation that
It is the situation

10

that Congress envisioned and still exists by the Indian Civil

11

Rights Act of 1968.

12

The jurisdictional plan that should go into effect

13

should result not in some forced, crammed-down jurisdiction

14

by the Indian people in the State of North Dakota, but through

15

a negotiated political process.

16

and act reasonably on a situation like this, reasonable results

17

could be obtained; a reasonable plan for either enforcing the

18

Indian forum could be reached or a reasonable plan for bringing

19

about the orderly assumption of state court jurisdiction on

20

the Indian reservations could be obtained.

21

no denial of equal protection in this case and should the Indian

22

plan — should Three Tribes jurisdictional plan be adopted,

23

in fact, we will have unequal protection and it will be the

24

unequal protection of having the class of super plaintiffs

holding down the class of hapless defendants and that will

the fundamental rights guaranteed to people under the

Constitution and that is a -- one of those rights is a guarantee

of access to a forum.

Well, Mr. Lee, it is certainly

12

understandable, I suppose, why the Indian tribes wouldn't want

to submit themselves to jurisdiction of state courts for all

purposes, isn't it, because they might well not want to have

15

If the fears are that the people of the

20

State of North Dakota are going to ignore the wishes of the

Indian people, that would be a factual problem that would develo

on a case-by-case basis, but the law, as it is written, would

23

solve that problem.

24

The law, as it is currently written in North Dakota,
Chapter 27-19, follows the framework set out by the language
34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

in Public Law 280 and it states that the law as between private

2

persons shall apply.
Therefore, those matters which are intrinsically

membership in the tribe, distribution of tribal benefits, those

will remain always tribal and the state court of North Dakota

10

How about matters of adoption or child

custody or marital dissolution, inheritance, things of that
kind?
MR. LEE:

11

I believe inheritance is specifically carved

12

out, but in those other areas which could be included, the

13

North Dakota law also includes a provision which answers that

14

question, Justice O'Connor, and it states that the tribal

15

customs and tribal traditions of the Indian people should first

16

be examined by the North Dakota courts and where possible that

17

those customs and traditions should be given credence, should

18

be given effect.

19

and in that particular section the North Dakota court is directed

20

to, if a conflict situation arises, resolve that conflict in

21

the favor of the Indian people.

I believe it is specifically Provision 27-19-11

They had

enough political clout in 1963 to be able to come in and

derail the North Dakota jurisdictional plan.

Given that situation, they have now had 20 years

MR. LEE:

The people of the State of North Dakota

10

recognize that its own state has sovereign immunity to the

11

extent that it hasn't been waived and the State of North Dakota

12

has not waived its sovereign immunity except in contract actions.

13

So, it is not a foreign situation for the people

14

of the State of North Dakota to be faced with a sovereign with

16

is a sovereign, we would have to concede that they do have

17

this immunity to pursue.

QUESTION:

19

imposes, as I understand it, is that they must waive their

sovereign immunity.

Can the tribe itself do that, give a

consent for the purpose of a short period of time and then

withdraw the complaint?

16

MR. LEE:

Yes, they can, sir.

The North Dakota

and I think the tribe acting as a corporate entity might be

considered like a person in that regard, if they consent, they

can withdraw that consent later on down the road if they become

dissatisfied with North Dakota jurisdictional plans and

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

MR* CROSS:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, to point out

10

that the tribal courts are open to non-Indian plaintiffs and

11

many non-Indian plaintiffs for debt collection and other purposes

12

take advantage of the tribal courts to maintain actions pre­

14

However, by contrast, the state courts are not open

15

to tribal Indians or tribal governments unless they consent

16

to the extension or virtually complete state civil jurisdiction

17

over the person or property.

18

The tribes believe that that infringes on their due

process and equal protection rights and as well it would

20

interfere with operation of fundamentally important federal

21

policies governing the Indian affairs area.

22

First of all, it would interfere with the doctrine
