add to you, however, that from the very beginning the

add to you that in seeking the imprimatur of the

District Court, its attendant jurisdictional powers, its

contempt powers, and everything else, the City of

20

Cleveland, certainly with a keen interest in not having

21

any back pay awards, chose to settle the alleged

22

discriminatory wrongs in the past on the backs of the

23

innocent non-minority firefighters.

We felt thit was wrong.

We feel that is wrong

That was done by

Would an individual member of the

union have had the veto power under your theory?
MR. SUMMERS;

Sir, not really veto power.

10

First of all, I believe under case law, the Vukovich

11

case out of our circuit, that once this became a matter

12

within the District Court, once this became a court

13

order under Title 7, that collateral attack was

14

precluded by anyone, and therefore a — in comparing it,

15

if you will, to Weber in the private sectoi,

16

challenge by Brian Weber was not precluded because that

17

affirmative action plan entered into between that union

18

and that employer did not preclude collateral attack,

19

and Brian Weber in fact did make his collateral attack,

20

but here, where you have it as a court order, certainly

21

collateral attack was prevented.

22

QUESTION;

that

Would you answer my question.

23

Could an individual member of the union have done what

24

you wanted the union to be able to do?

MR. SUMMERS;

Yes, he would have been able to

Would you explain how the union is

bound by the consent decree since it didn’t consent?
MR. SUHMER3*

It is bound by the consent

12

— for example, there was a collective bargaining

13

agreement in this that is recited, and I have lodged

14

that jast recently with

15

this Court.

The collective bargaining agreement said that

16

the city was bound to follow all of the specific rules

and regulations of the Civil Service Commission which

19

of Cleveland and the constitution of the State of Ohio.

17

explanation provided, "The relief available is a court

QUESTIONS

MR. SUMMERS;

Mr. Justice Blackmun, that is a

10

very difficult question, but I think

11

that Senator Humphrey stood for were strong enough that

12

if he felt the necessity for quota relief in 1985, he

13

would do everything within his power on the floor of

14

Congress to see that those words were in fact added to

this title, and in explaining on so many occasions

before that very same Congress that Congress was not

18

nor to

19

it very clear what the intent of that bill was at that

20

time, and in knowing his job the way he knew it, if it

21

were necessary to change it, he would see that the

possibility would have every opportunity to come about,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM BRADFORD REYNOLDS, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

9

IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. REYNOLDS*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

11

please the Court, as Mr. Summers stated, the question

12

that is raised by this case is purely one of statutory

13

construction, whether a judicial order entered with the

14

consent of the employer is subject to the remedial

15

limitations imposed by Section 706(g) of Title 7.

16

Section 705(g) prescribes all remedial orders,

17

all remedial court orders that grant preferential

18

treatment to nonvirtims of discrimination.

19

victim-specific limitation on a court’s Title 7 remedial

20

power is in no way relaxed where the employer consents

21

to the entry of the decree.

22

the legislative history of Section 706(g) lends itself

23

to a selective reading of th? p.nrase, "no order of the

24

court,” and it is simply not the case that the explicit

25

statutory constraint on a court’s authority to order

So that as to what happened with

Mr. Reynolds, can I ask you another

It refers to no relief for a particular individual, and

then it defines the kind of individual for which the

18

relief shall not be given as "if such individual” -- the

19

"such" refers back — "was refused admission," and so

forth, "for any reason other than discrimination on

account of race."

some other reason within the meaning of that section? A

When

Congress — Vanguards here assert two points and I will

address both.

When Congress enacted Title 7, it gave
24

(202) 628-9300

1

the federal courts broad authority to remedy

2

discrimination, including the authority to use

3

race-conscious remedies in appropriate circumstances,

4

and second, this Court should treat a consent decree,

5

which includes race-conscious affirmative action as

6

voluntary action in accordance with Weber not as

7

court-imposed relief, and it does not make a difference

8

that the petitioner did not consent.

9

Now, before turning to the merits of my

10

argument, I would like to address a couple of factual

11

points that came up during the preceding 3D minutes.

12

First, there is simply no dispute on the

13

record that for years the City of Cleveland has

14

discriminated against minorities and that a remedy was

15

appropriate.

16

is unreasonable.

17

18

decree that requires the pronotlon of unqualified

19

individuals.

20

As a

There is r.o argument also that this remedy

matter of fact, passing a promotional

examination is a prerequisite to minority and

non-minority promotion alike.

point out that there is nothing on the record to show

24

that this particular remedy, this particnlar affirmative

25

action plan actually denies any non-minorities any

promotions

2

One thing is clear from the record.

That is,

3

the city created substantially more promotions, and this

4

is conceded by the petitioner.

5

substantially more promotions to accommodate the

6

interests of both minorities ani non-minorities alike,

7

and there is no indication that any particular

8

non-minority was denied a promotion in favor of a

9

minority.

10

QUESTION*

The city created

But ordinarily if the city created

11

more promotions, as you refer to them,

MR. STEGEs

13

promotions.
