Mr. Evans, you may

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. EVANS, ESQ.
CM BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

5

MR. EVANS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

6

please the Court, in 1981 the Indiana legislature passed
7

a Reapportionment Act following the 1980 census, and
8

this Act was modified and amended in certain minor
9

respects in 1982.
10

The defendants, the Democrats in this case,
11

did not apparently, according to the record, pursue
12

their legislative remedies any further and

there's no

13

evidence that in 1983,

the 19 83 General Session of the

14

Indiana General Assembly, that they introduced any bill
15

in the legislature to try to change the Feappcrtionment
16

Act in any way.

So, instead of pursuing a legislative

17

remedy before the Indiana voters, they chose to attempt
18

a judicial remedy in the federal court and filed their
19

lawsuit in federal court in 1982.
20

This case is before the Court, and it is what
21

appears to me to be a high visibility case, and a lot of
22

articles in the newspaper about this case.

I think the

23

reason for that is because of

the strange alignment of

24

parties on both sides of this appeal.
25

1

But, I don’t believe that the issues in this

2

case are all that novel, and I believe that this Court

3

in past opinions has in fact considered many of the

4

issues that are before the Court today.
So, I will start my argument with a discussion

5

6

cf the Whitcomb v. Chavis case decided by this Court in

7

1971, which I feel deals with many of the issues that

8

the Court has in our briefs this morning.

9

Whitcomb v.

Chavis was a case that came from Indiana, involved the
same state, involved the same county, ffarion County, and

10

involved

the same city,

cf Indianapolis, and even

11

involved on the three-judge panel a District Court Judge
12

on that panel in 1969,

who is also on the panel of this

13

appeal today.
14

In ' hitcomb v. Chavis, this Court first of all
15

carefully con iidered the question of racial
16

discrimination in the electoral rules and laws in
17

Indiana involving particularly multi-member districts in
18

1969.

And what this Court says is a matter of racial

19

discrimination, they said there is no evidence that the
20

multi-member districts which had existed in Indiana for
21

many, many years were created, desianed cr maintained
V

tc

22

further racial discrimination .
23

In making that statement, in the opinion by
24

Justice White, he mentioned the Sims v. Baggett case as
25

4

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, U.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

an example of what he meant.

That was a District Court

case where the blacks were gaining political power under
2

a single-member district system, and all of a sudden,
3

for rhe sole reason of defeating black voting strength
4

in that case, the issue the Court found, they went to a
5

multi-member district system.
6

And obviously, the Court said

in Whitcomb v.

7

Chavis, that is a discriminatory use of multi-member
8

districts, and the Court struck it down in Sims v.
9

Baggett.

But in the Whitcomb v. Chavis case, this Court

10

said it found no evidence in Indiana of racial
11

discrimination at all.

The Court commented on tha fact

12

that there had been multi-member districts for many
13

years, and there had been a mix in the House of
14

Representatives of multi-member and single-member
15

districts, again for many, many years.
16

So, the Court considered this racial question
17

first of all, which obviously is of great concern to
18

this Court, to protect the rights of the minority o ;
19

black citizens of Indiana.

Then it went on and it

20

looked at the kind of people that were raising a
21

question, tha plaintiffs in that case who were ghetto
22

peer in the center of Indianapolis.
23

And, this Court in Whitcomb v. Chavis said
24

that these voters were overwhelmingly Democrat voters.

Sc the Court, then, was dealing with a racial question

2

put aside with a question of outvoted Democrats in

3

center of Indianapolis and what their constitutional

4

rights were.

the

Mr. Evans, did the court telov

consider the effect of this plan under Section 2 of the

7

Voting Rights Act as amended7
MR. EVANSs

8

9

Justice O'Connor,

in this case the

lower court did, and this makes this case so different

10

front other cases because in this case the lower court

11

said, there has been no violation by this

12

Reapportionment Act in Indiana of Section 2 of the

13

Voting Rights Act.

14

right of black citizens under the fourteenth or

15

fifteenth amendment.

There has been no violation of the

There is absolutely nothing in this record

16
17

that would justify any relief on the part of black

18

voters, and there was some plaintiffs where the NAACF

19

filed an action, a companion, action and

20

their claim and they have not cross-appealed at all.

the Court denied

So, it is fair to say, in Whitcomb v. Chavis

21

22

there was no racial discrimination in Indiana, from the

23

record, nor is there any in this case before the Court

24

today.

25

So, we have to put race to one side.
And then in Whitcomb v. Chavis, decision by
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Justice White, he said, what cons ituticnal rights do

2

outvoted Democrats have as a political group in the

3

center of Indianapolis,

4

the question, are they able to participate in the

5

political process.

6

and he very carefully looked to

Did these ghetto poor citizens have a right tc

10

Did they have a right to participate in the
Sere they

Were they an effective force?
And, the Court said, yes,

they were and

11

perhaps anticipating the Court's decision later in

12

v. Segester, the Court found that not to be true with

13

blacks around Dallas, Texas.

14

all political processes had been met in

15

Chavis case and therefore these outvoted Democrats have

16

no constitutional right to a remedy.

17

White

But here the Court said
the Whitcomb v.

And the Court said, in Whitcomb v. Chavis

18

again, this is true whether we're de.linc with

multi-member districts or single-member districts.

That was the political system set forth by the

6

Indiana legislature and the Court found no

7

constitutional wrong with that.

8

and finally said, perhaps the idea of cancelling the

9

vote is a euphemism for political defeat at the polls,

So, the Court went on

10

so in the Whitcomb v.

11

considering a claim of a political group, namely the

12

outvoted Democrats in the city of Indianapolis.

Now, in dissent -- the opinion was written by

14

Justice White and joined by the Chief Justice and

15

Justice Blackmun, but in dissent Justice Brennan and

16

Justice Marshall did not araue with that point.

17

said that an ideological, political interest group does

18

not get the same constitutional protections as is true

19

of black citizens, because they mention the fifteenth

20

amendment and they mention the Civil War amendments

21

which were designed to help black citizens in their

22

constitutional rights.

So, we have — these Justices, I feel, in

Whitcomb v. Chavis have taken a strong stand that what

QUESTION*

Well, I thought one of ycur major

3

points was that we shouldn’t review this case at all, on

4

the merits; we should say it is not justiciable.

5

NR. EVA NSi

6

QUESTION*

That is true. Your Honor.
It does not sound tc me like if you

7

are citing the multi-member district case, and I suppose

8

you are going to talk about Gaffney —

9

MR. EVANS;

10

11

We had thought of Gaffney, yes.

QUESTION:

Well, are you still pressing us to

say that this issue is not justiciable?

12

MR.

1?

QUESTION*

14

MR. EVANS*

EVANS;

I am, Your Honor, but we are here.
It doesn’t sound much like —
We are here today, so the Court

15

must be interested in

the question.

But I do believe

16

that the issue is not justiciable, and in the briefs we

17

went into that at great length and the Ccurt,

18

is familiar with the 'egal arguments.

I assume,

I am trying to say it is a practical matter.

19

QUESTION*

So, you are making an argument,

20

assuming it is justiciable, you do not think there was
21

an unconstitutional gerrymander here?
22

MR. EVANS*

Yes, Your Ponor, that is my

23

position.

I do not believe it was justiciable at all.

24

I believe, if the Court were to think about it, who in

this roos could say how many Republicans and hew many

2

Democrats should serve in the Indiana General Assembly?
Those kind of judgments are inherently

3
4

political and it would be almost impossible for a court

5

tc come up with an acceptable standard.
QUESTION*

6

But if you say it*s not

7

justiciable, that means that even the most extreme

8

example of gerrymandering would not be subject to any

9

judicial review?
MR. EVANS;

10

Your Honor, I believe particularly

11

where we're dealing with two major parties, I believe

12

that is true.

13

Province case where this Court showed special concern

14

fer discrete and isolated minorities, the Ccurt has some

15

duty and as Justice Marshall said in his dissent in the

16

Mobile v. Bolden case, you take a group that has been

17

discriminated against for a long time, decades and

18

decades, and cannot because of that past discrimination

19

and the effect cf the Civil Sights Amendment, can't have

20

their views presented through the political process,

21

that might give rise to a need for some sort of judicial

22

relief.

I believe that ever since the Carrollton

political parties, I would say under no conditions —

3

MR. EYANS*

distinction in Whitcomb v. Chavis, Your Honor, and I was

in my argument making that distinction.

But racial gerrymandering is

justiciable?
MR. EVANS*
QUESTION?

And has been, yes, sir.
What about Gaffney?

That was not a

17

racial gerrymander.

That was a partisan gerrymander.

18

MR. EVANS*

That is right.

19

QUESTION*

And we reviewed it.

20

MR. EVANS:

Yes, and in the Gaffney case the

21

Court did review and approved the reappcrticnwent plans
22

in the Gaffney case.

And that case is interesting,

23

speaking of the question of seat vote ratios which were
24

so important to the lower court here, it said in Indiana

that 51.9 percent of the votes were for the Democrats in

2

the House of Representatives and they only got 43 seats

3

in the 1982 election.

That was one of the main, perhaps the single

5

most important point in the minds of the twc-to-one

6

majority in our case.

greater than even that differential, and the Court

hr. Evans, may I ask you this

15

question.

Putting the racial issue aside, is it your

16

position, if the one-man, one-vote rule is

17

satisfactorily met, that that's the end cf the case and

nothing else is to be considered oy us?

10

case by someone who is not a discrete and insular

entirely, if you were using the computer, without

in some of your arguments.

15

Indiana to try to get some relief, we had a situation,

Apart from that, what other things?

MR. EVANS;

The Legislature then followed the

tests under the state law which were emphasized by this
14

Court in Marcher.

For example, they avoided contests

15

between incumbents; they preserved the cere of previous
16

districts, were two state guidelines that were followed.
17

I think before the Court can make a

judgment

on — that you might be interested, you must recognize

that no other alternative plan was ever presented in the

thing»

3

Republicans were piggish.

4

elected in the Reagan landslide of 1980 that they only

5

had so many votes to go around, so meeting all these

6

guidelines, there were so many marginal districts that

7

as a matter of fact the Democrats could win in a good

8

Democrat year.

They had so many Republicans

We know based upon their own exhibits, their

9
10

We know the Democrat leader himself said that

own statistics, there were 67 seats in the Rouse in the
1982 election that were either safe Democrat seats or

11

competitive seats within a 45

to 55 percent range,

67

12

out of 100 seats in the Indiana Rouse.

That is the

13

result of the reapporticnment .
14

How,

if we have candidates that can't move

15

;ith that kind of a chance, I

think that's not a problem

16

this Court need address.

As I say, there are some

17

Justices who would perhaps look at this question, on the
18

question of rationality.

Is it rational?

Was the plan

19

entirely motivated by a desire to severely damage the
20

other pa rty?
21

That question has been raised by some of the
22

Justices, and I would like to say a word or two about
23

that.

Amplifying on what I said to Justice Powell, we

24

have a situation where the Indiana Legislature,
25

1 8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

consistently throughout the state, without question, all

2

over the state followed these guidelines.

3

Now, In the Karcher case we have just the

4

opposite.

5

offered of not diluting the black voting strength.

6

the district court said, that is not true because in the

7

Fourth District in Karcher where I think there was a 17

8

percent black majority vote, the Court said -- they just

9

ignored that.

In the Karcher case there was a justification

They did not adjust that.

Put

They did not

10

take any effect to protect the black voting strength in

11

the Fourth District.

12

Just the opposite here.

The Court found in

13

Indiana that the General Assembly did in fact protect

14

the black vote, so we have a fact.

It is rational, and

15

no one has to re-invant the wheel.

The legislature has

16

districts that are multi-member.

17

to single-member districts.

18

They didn't have to go

They had a right to take what

they had before

19

them in the background of the Whitcomb v. Chavis case.

20

They knew multi-member districts were proper.

21

used multi-member districts in the new plan and they

22

went ahaad with what they had, took care of the blacks,

23

took care of the one-man, one-vote.

So,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE R. BOEHM, ESQ.

10

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

11

NR. BOEHM*

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

12

the Court, I should like to begin by correcting what we

13

believe to be a few factual misapprehensions that the

14

Court may have gained in the course of the presentation

15

this morning.

16

There were indeed alternative maps presented

17

to the General Assembly, both in the session during

18

which these laws were enacted and in subs*_guent

19

sessions.

20

learn that they never saw the light of day.

21

However, the Court will not be startled tc

An example appears as Exhibit 48 in the

22

record.

23

underlines is that there is no remedy within the

24

legislature for the wrong of which we are complaining,

25

and that it is and was a useless act to present to the

I simply want to point out that what this

3

fox a correction of the chicken coop guardian situation.
The competitive districts to which Mr. Evans
referred are by his measure competitive in the sense
that if an additional 15 or so percent of the statewide

4

candidates on the Democratic ticket had run an
5
additional ten percent ahead of the top of the
6

Democratic ticket, it would have been possible to gain
7
control of the state legislature.
8

That's what the cottom line of that
9
“competitive" as he uses it is.
10

QUESTION:

How does that com?

to be?

Is that

11

done by computers?
12

ME. BOEHM:

Mr. Evans’ statistics are done

13
manually, Your Honor.

What he did is, took the top of

14
the Democratic statewide ticket and created a chart that
15
was not an exhibit in the case, was not introduced

in

16
evidence, and is a summary, thouoh, of data that is in
17
the record .
18
It is, we submit, a

manipulation cf the data

19
but even on that manipulated data it demonstrates that
20

the high-water mark for the Democrats doesn’t do the job
21

on this map, and that even if

the Democrats have a

22

substantial majority of

the votes they cannot gain a

23
majority of the seats under foreseeable election returns.
24
Finally, on the comment about multi-member

22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

districts, it is correct in one sense that Indiana has

2

historically had multi-member districts.

3

the Constitution of 1851 forward through the districts

4

involved

5

Court dealt, these multi-member districts were counties.

6
7

However,

from

in Whitcomb against Chavis with which this

The legislature was apportioned among the
counties, which is the basic unit of government in
Indiana, and by 1971 fifteen, for example, were

8

apportioned to Marion County which is the City of
9

Indianapolis.
10

That scheme is not what is involved here.
11

Those were multi-member districts, but there was no
12

showing and there was no contention, and it was not true
13

that those multi-member districts were dene for
14

invidious discriminatory purposes.

They simply were an

15

effort tc allocate representation among the counties and
16

they respected the historical practice of attempting tc
17

give courties representation within the state
8

government, a perfectly legitimate objective cf state
19

geve rnmen t.
20

The multi-member districts that we are
21

attacking here today bear no relationship tc anything
22

other than the objective of maximizing the preservation
23

of the transient majority's control of the state
24

legislature.

They are fundamentally, qualitatively

But you would be no happier,

3

however, if it were zero percent deviation and still

4

came out with this sort of gerrymander?

5

MR. BCFHM;

6

QUESTION;

That is correct.
Under your theory, it seems to me

7

that almost any time a reapportionment or redistricting

QUESTIONS

1

That ends up with the Democrats not

getting what, arguably,

what they desire, what they are

2

entitled to vote-wise.
3

MR. BOEHMs

We do not claim that we are

4

entitled to any specific number of seats in the General
5

Assembly.

He do claim that we are entitled to be free

6

from a statute that arbitrarily, that is to say without
7

justification in any proper governmental purpose, harms
8

us.

That is a fundamental equal protection doctrine,

9

any classification of citizens.
10

QUESTION;

Nell, what justification could

11

there be to give the Democrats fewer seats than they are
12

entitled to in terms of their voting population?
13

MR. BOEHM;

Several

things could do it, and

14

they have been iterated in the opinions cf this Court.

Adherance to county lines, recognitio i —
16

QUESTION;

Well, were they articulated by the

17

Court of Appeals or not?
18

MR. BOEHM;

They were, by the District Court,

19

Your Honor.

Yes, and the District Court, uniformly found

20

that none of these proper justifications was present in
21

this case including specifically a finding that the
22

claim that these maps were somehow designed to preserve
23

the integrity of the black vote, was fanciful.
24

There is simply no showing in this record that
25

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

this map was required by any desire to prevent a

2

degradation of the black vote, and the district court

3

specifically rejected that contention.

4

QUESTION:

Shat if we were to upheld your

5

claim in this case and say there has to be some kind of

6

neutral objective, and sc it goes back tc the Indiana

7

Legislature, and this time they say, the Papublican

8

majority says, we can still get the Democrats and that

9

is what we intend to do, but we will kind of preserve

10

county lines in most of them.

11

Now, would that eliminate your claim, or would

12

you still have the claim even though there was some

13

neutral factor they could point to, if their intern: was

14

simply to get as much for the Republicans as they could,

15

and that preserving county lines was just a kind of a

16

gimmick?

17

MR. BOEHM:

Preserving county lines is one

18

restriction, Your Honor, just like population equality

19

is a restriction, just like the requirement that if

20

they're going tc have different sized districts, in

21

other words some multi,

23

governmental reason which there was in Hhitcomb against

24

(202) 628-9300

1

Now, the effect of that scheme, of course, was

2

not to discriminate against one party or another,

3

because whichever party then carried Harion County

4

carried all 15 seats and had reasonable access to the

5

control of the Legislature.

6

Here they took the very same body politic,

7

Harion County which previously had 15 seats under the

8

*70 census, discovered that it had only 14 — and. by the

9

way, coincidentally, a perfect 14 — it could have been

10

carved up into 14 single member districts perfectly.

11

But, in order to preserve its 15 seats in the

12

Legislature they took Marion County, patched on areas

13

from three continouous counties, to create five

14

three-member districts out of an area that is

15

essentially 47-53 Republican.

16

Now, having done that, they took the hole of

17

that doughnut and gave it three seats.

The hole in that

18

doughnut is approxima:ely 90 percent Democratic.

19

rest of the Democratic vote is by and large on the

20

periphery of the hole, and it was carved up into four

21

separate parts, each of which was then subjected to

22

additional votes from suburban and exurban areas.

23

Pesult, twelve tc three cut of an area that is 57 to

out into the surrounding areas, took farmland and

split the city of Ft. Wayne right duwn the middle,

The first is —

It may be, but in theory do you

think you have to prove intent first?
MR. BCEHKs

I think you can- talk about it as

14

intent if you wish.

15

should be proved by objective criteria.

what the consequences of his acts are.

Now, in this case we have the remarkable gift

of a confession.

Now, that is pretty good evidence that they did it.

is non-justiciable, I guess we do not have to address

HR. BOEHM;

Assuming that is true, Mr. Chief

Justice, for our purposes the point is that a difference

of both players.

representatives and the U.S. Senators, could run well

Here we have something that does not occur at

justiciability of this case is evident from Baker and

Carr itself, that this case is capable of being analyzed

in traditional equal protection terms.

tell the person who wrote the opinion what it means.

4

6

Implicitly.

I have not recently. Your Honor.
My question was, was justiciability

put at issue?
MR. BCEHMs

10

I do not know the answer to that.

11

It certainly was at least implicitly put at issue in the

12

fact that the Court dealt with the question and resolved

13

it.

14

QUESTIONi

15

MR. BGEKM;

That is not always the case.
In any event, Baker and Carr, we

16

submit, does deal with the question at length and says

17

what is and is not justiciable, and it holds that a

18

matter is justiciable unless it falls *.nto the area

19

reserved to another co-equal branch of the federal

20

government, which this plainly does not.

21

You are simply adjudicating the validity of a
V

22

statute of a state, the sort of thing this Court does

23

all the time, and it is analyzable in very traditional

24

equal protection terms.

25

of citizens?

Is the statute a classification

The answer is plainly yes.

It puts people

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

in different parts of the state in different categories.

2

It is aimed at a category of citizens, in this

3

case those aligned with the Democratic Party, and it

4

does in fact very severely harm them.

That is what the

Equal Protection Clause says cannot be dene.
5

QUESTION;

But it is certainly different from

6

the holding in Baker against Carr in that each of these
7

people's vote is going tc be counted the same way in the
8

ballot box?
9

MB. BOEHM;

Nell, that’s correct, and I think

10

you need

to realize, you need

to focus on the impact of

11

the plan as a whole here.

Does the plan as a whole

12

disadvantage one group or another?
13

Any individual, of course, gets his or her
14

vote counted and that happens in a map that is

population erratic or a map that has districts like we

The result is identical.

2

gerrymander, as it has come to be called, is a

3

well-known phenomenon and anybody with the time and the

computer technology in 1980 can draw a map, and a good

example is presented in the briefs submitted by the

Republican National Committee in which they took the

very same election results for Marion County,

that produced 12 to 3 Republican and drew a map that

shows 11 to 4 Democrat within a Republican unit.

the doctrine of Baker against Carr beyond where it is

MR. BOEHMj

13

On the question of justiciability,

14

Baker and Carr, we submit, does not require any

15

pushing.

16

that leads inevitably to the conclusion that this is

justiciable.

It already gives you the doctrinal framework

that racial or political groups, if the subject is

invidious discrimination, may present constitutional

claims.

MR. EVANS*

Well, it depends on where you

5

start.

As a matter of redistricting process. Justice

6

Stevens, if you start in Marion County that’s probably
7

true.
8

9
10

But in this case the legislators started in a

different part of the state and as they got down to
Marion County with the changes back and forth, it just
doesn't fit in that neat a package.

11

Also, in a sense it’s helpful to the Democrats

12

because it gives Marion County, the urban area, 15 seats

13

where they might otherwise only have had 14.

14

that's a matter within the discretion of the

15

legislature. Your Honor.

16

QUESTION*

I think

I don't think that —

If you get over the hurdle of

17

justiciability, if your opponent does, would you agree

18

that :here must be a rational basis for the plan?

21

MR. EVANS*

I would

say so. Your Honor, and I

think, following the guidelines cf this Court as were
done would justify it, yes.
QUESTION*

If you say there must be a rational

22

basis, would you say that the desire to maximize the

political strength of the majority party is a rational

There is no such plan.

tc you,

what would be wrong with that suggestion, if

2

your view of the law is correct?
HR. EVANS;

3

Because the plan should be made by

4

the representatives — the citizens through their

5

representatives.

6

Your Honor.

That hasn’t been done in this case.

The fact that a computer was used certainly

7
8

can’t be of concern to the Court because the Democrats

9

had every opportunity tc develop another plan with the

10

same criteria with less impact in their party if they

11

cared to do so, and this was done in accordance with all

12

the procedures and processes of the Indiana General

13

Assembly.

right to have it done outside of the normal electoral

process.

QUESTION;

Hell, didn’t the District Court

find that the only reason for this plan was to minimize

the Democratic representation?

No,.Your Honor.

more weight to community of interest and meets the
