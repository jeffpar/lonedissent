ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD GLEN POLLY, ESQ.

ON EEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. POLLY:

Mr. Polly?

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The issue in this matter is whether exceptional

8

circumstances exist to justify the stay, referring to the current

9

state action in this pure diversity action.

10

In the San Carlos Apache case, the dismissal was

11

upheld because the state's suits were adequate to quantify

12

the rights, water rights of the Indians.

13

Number two, they were carrying amendment policies

14

irrelevant; number three, the state expertise and administra­

15

tive machinery is adequate and set up.

The infancy of the federal suits, particularly the
judicial bias against piecemeal litigation an 3 convenience
to the parties involving duplication of issues and effort.
The reasoning mentioned there to some great extent was that
the concurrent federal proceedings as duplicative and wasteful,
generating additional litigation through inconsistent disposition
of property.
And, number two, the concurrent proceedings creates
a serious potential for spawning an

unseemly and destructive

waste to see which forum can resolve the-; same issues first

In the Moses Cone Hospital case, the stay reversal
was affirmed because the piecemeal litigation was not avoided
as to the architect in the state court.

The priority measured

by progress in the suits was not in favor of stay.

The federal

law was the rule of decision on the merits and the state court
action was inadequate to protect the rights.
The Court —
QUESTION:
court action now.

Mr. Polly, what has happened to the state
It proceeded as I understood.

MR. POLLY:

The state court action is set for trial

November 4.
QUESTION:
MR. POLLY:

I see.
The court was guided in the Moses Cone

case by the federal policy and law to not delay arbitration
under the Federal Arbitration Act.
The court noted specifically that vexatious or
reactive nature of suits may influence the decision as to whether
to defer to the concurrent state action.
This occurred not only in the Moses Cone case in
the Court of Appeals, but also in the Calvert case and was
mentioned by this Court as having considerable merit.
In the Colorado River case, the dismissax was upheld
because the McCarran Amendment federal policy to avoid piecemeal

litigation of water rights in a river system.

2

Number two, the absence of proceedings beyond the

3

complaint; number three, particularly the extensive involvement

4

of state water rights involving numerous defendants and the

5

distance between state court and Denver and the Division Seven

6

location of the size of the water right; and number five, the

7

existing participation of U.S. in other similar state proceed­

8

ings.

9

for justifying the stay derives.

10

There, the particular language relating to the basis

The court said the issue must be decided on the basis

11

of wise judicial administration, giving regard to conservation

12

of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litiga­

13

tion.

14

The court noted the 'irtual unflagging obligation

15

to exercise jurisdiction.

16

of wise judicial administration are more limited and exceptional

17

and the court indicated that there must be a weighing of factors

18

with only the clearest of justifications.

19

described as consider the obligation to exercise as opposed

20

to factors counseling against exercise.

21

The court also noted that the reasons

The scales were

The factors in this case are, number one, the priority

22

of assuming jurisdiction of property, the question of in rem

23

application.

?A
25

This question has never been specifically an issue.
Roberts & Schaefer says the state action is in personam and
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

I simply point out that that was deliberately so by Roberts

2

& Schaefer.

3

QUESTION:

What do you think the federal court should

4

have done if Roberts had to come to federal court first?

5

started the suit, started the litigation, and Lake Coal counter­

6

claimed in the federal court and then Lake Coal went to the

7

state court and started this suit?

8
9
10

MR. POLLY:

Justice White, I believe that the cases

indicate that it would not matter if the same circumstances
exist.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. POLLY:

13

QUESTION:

After the suit starts in the federal court?
Right.
Lake Coal starts a case of its own in

14

a state court and then moves to federal court to dismiss.

15

Should the federal court grant that?

16
17
18
19

20
21

It

MR. POLLY:

The existence of the state action —

It is assumed that Lake would file the state action as well
after the federal action.
So, the order in which the two were filed does not
determine —
QUESTION,':

So, in my example you would be arguing

22

for the same result, mainly the federal court should dismiss

23

the action.

24

MR. POLLY:

25

QUESTION:

So long as — Yes, Mr. Justice White.
All right
6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. POLLY:

So long as the piecemeal litigation

2

situation exists in the state court where the subcontractors

3

are parties and they are not parties in the federal court

4

action.

5

I pointed out that the in rem question —

6

QUESTION:

Well, what if there weren't subcontractors

7

who were parties to the state action and the federal court

8

is filed first?

9

MR. POLLY:

I think in that event we do not have

10

piecemeal litigation questions and in all likelihood the state

11

action — the federal action would stand.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. POLLY:

14

QUESTION:

Even though only state issues were involved?
Yes.
So, in this case, except for the other

15

parties that were in the state suit, if they hadn't been made

16

parties in the state suit, but the federal court case was started

17

later, you would think the federal court case could go ahead,

18

is that right?

19

20
21

MR. POLLY:

Well, I think there is argument under

the cases for the position that the federal court under the
test, because state law applies in all the other factors

22

indicate in favor of stay.

23

in that manner in the discretion of the court.

24
25

QUESTION:

I think that it could be decided
But —

Do you think the removal power is a factor

to be considered whether or not an action in a state court
7
ALDFRSON REPORTING COMPANY INC.

1

could be removed to the federal court?
MR. POLLY:

2

I think yes.

I think one of the cases

3

indicated that lower court cases -- In fact, where removal

4

was possible it was more indicated that the federal action

5

should be stayed, because there, instead of filing a separate

6

suit, removal could have been achieved.
QUESTION:

7

Where the subcontractors are parties in

8

a state court action in this case no removal is possible under

9

the federal removal statute, is that right?

10

MR. POLLY:

That is correct, Justice O'Connor.

11

The point is the R&S attempted removal and the federal

12

court remanded the case to the state court and then six months

13

after the state court action was stopped the second federal

14

court action was filed by Roberts & Schaefer.
There is indication here of defensive tactical

15
16

maneuvers on the part of Roberts & Schaefer.

17

the removal, then when the :emoval fails, attempt a second

18

action.

19

Occupy Lake with

I started to point out before the questions were

20

asked that with respect to in rem Roberts & Schaefer deliberately

21

did not file its lien in its counterclaim in the state court

22

and did not amend that counterclaim until after the district

23

judge had ruled.

y\
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Polly, I take it from one of your

answers to one of Justice White's questions — tell me if I
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

am wrong in saying I take it that you would agree that there

2

is a fair amount of discretion in the district court.

3

he might decide to stay the federal action, he might not decide

4

to stay the federal action and conceivably he could be affirmed

5

by the court of appeals, whichever thing he did.

6

MR. POLLY:

7

Yes, I think that is the case.

I think that is the case, Justice Rehnquist

8

The indication —

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, if the district court had refused

to dismiss the case — He dismissed, didn't he?

11

MR. POLLY:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. POLLY:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. POLLY:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. POLLY:

18

That

Yes, he stayed.
Yes, he stayed.

He didn't dismiss.

No.
He stayed.
He stayed.
What if he had refused to stay?
I think that would have been subject

to appeal as well.

19

QUESTION:

Well, I know, but I thought you — You

20

mean, he would not have had the discretion to entertain the

21

suit.

22

MR. POLLY:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. POLLY:

25

No.
He would have had to stay.
In my opinion, yes. he had to stay,

because of the circumstances of the piecemeal litigation in
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

3
4

6

the state court.
QUESTION:

So, his discretion would not have extended

so far as to — as not to stay in this case.
MR. POLLY:

No, no.

I mean, that is very clear under

these cases.
The question, as I understood from Justice Rehnquist,

7

was setting aside the piecemeal litigation question did the

8

federal court have discretion without piecemeal litigation.

9

That is the question I thought was being asked.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. POLLY:

Right.
Now, when you say what indication is

12

there of vexation and react to tactical defense of maneuvers,

13

it is quite obvious that when the in rem part of this case

14

/as deliberately avoided, although that question never was

15

specifically in point in this case, because the counterclaim

16

in the state court did not incorporate the lien that was

17

incorporated in the federal action.

18

as the district judge made his decision, the counterclaim was

19

amended by Roberts & Schaefer to include the lien.

20

made the decision in July and immediately after he made the

21

decision in July the amended counterclaim was filed.

22

think my opposition will deny that.

23
24
25

But, certainly as soon

The judge

I don't

But, nevertheless, that is not the basis for the
district judge's decision.
The second issue is whether there was any inconvenience
10

1

of the federal forum and we don't indicate any inconvenience

2

in this case.

3

a similar mountain county.

4

McCoy feud that Mr. Combs speaks about in his brief occurred.

5

7

The federal forum is in the adjoining county,

QUESTION:

In fact, where the Hatfield and

Where is the site of the nearest federal

courthouse?
MR. POLLY:

Pikeville, Pikeville, Kentucky.

Pike

8

County which is just adjacent and in as deep of the mountains

9

as Letcher County is.

10

What Roberts & Schaefer expected to achieve in its

11

claim of — late claim of saying, well, we have the basis here

12

of imagined prejudice in the local court.

13

federal court would be the same with respect to the jury.

14

QUESTION:

The trial in the

I talked to one of your colie igues in

15

Kentucky who had argued Thermtron here and asked him, after

16

Thermtron was decided, why he was interested in getting into

17

a federal court rather than the Kentucky state coi.rt and he

18

said in a federal court you can draw your jurors from a large

19

part of the state, whereas if you are a state court, it is

20

just the particular county you are in.

21

MR. POLLY:

Well, yes, particular county in state

22

court but in a large part of the same locale in federal court,

23

in other words, come from other counties.

24
25

As T understood it, Roberts & Schaefer's comments
about the Hatfield and McCoy feud was almost as if he is going
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

to get a different make up in his jury down at federal court

2

and that is not true.

3

The third question is the priority of the progress

4

of the suits and, of course, that is not at issue in this case

5

at the time the decision was made by the district court, but

6

we do know now that the progress of the state suit is relevant

7

in terms of practical application in this case.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. POLLY:

10

When is that suit set for trial?
November 4th of this year.

The primary — As I have indicated, the primary basis

11

for upholding the stay in this case is the avoidance of

12

piecemeal litigation.

13

in the state action and not the federal action.

14

issues that require the same proof as would be in the federal

15

action.

16

question with respect to the subcontractors and the same proof

17

would have to be introduced again by the same parties and cause

18

obviously piecemeal litigation.

19

Clearly the subcontractors are defendants
There are

The federal action would in no wise dispose of that

QUESTION:

Mr. Polly, suppose you proceed with the

20

state litigation next month and it goes to judgment.

21

this case become moot?

22

MR. POLLY:

Does

Justice Blackmun, in my opinion it does.

23

The state action would be res judicata so long as — if this

24

case were affirmed, if the Roberts u Schaefer attorney could

25

not obtain quick action by the district judge and attempt to
12
AI DFR^ON RFPORTINft COMPANY INC

1

get an adjudication there on a summary judgment motion, if

2

summary judgment was rendered before November 4, then the state

3

action would be moot.
QUESTION:

4

But, certainly there is an appeal from

5

the Circuit Court of Letcher County within the Kentucky judicial

6

system.

,
MR. POLLY:

7

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes, in the sense of res

8

judicata assuming that the state court action is upheld in

9

the appeal.

I mean, we were discussing this.

As I understood

10

it, Justice Rehnquist, that the state court action is decided.

11

To me, that mean final — If it is finally decided, it is res

12

judicata.

13

Of course, if the trial verdict was appealed and

14

reversed, then I think certainly there is no question but the

15

decision of this Court is very relevant and in no wise moot.

16

QUESTION:

Which would be res judicata, if the Kentucky

17

trial proceedings ended first, but the federal court went ahead —

18

say they vacated the stay or something — and the federal that

19

upheld the process ran its course first.

20

case be res judicata?

21

appellate process works, but assume it is slower than the federal.

22

MR. POLLY:

Would the federal

I don't know how fast your Kentucky

Right.

In my opinion, Justice Stevens,

23

once a verdict is rendered in the state court, that judgment

24

becomes res judicata with respect to the federal proceedings

25

and would change the federal proceedings.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. POLLY:

3

Even though it is on appeal?
The federal proceedings would not even

be subject to appeal at that —

4

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

Even if the state court judg­

5

ment is not final in the sense that there is review pending

6

in the appellate court of Kentucky.

7

MR. POLLY:

I think, yes.

The res judicata effect

8

of the state court judgment coming first would affect the federal

9

proceedings in terms of a stay at that point based on the decision

there.
The Court of Appeals in this case held that piecemeal
litigation is not involved because Lake has shown n^ arguably
valid claim against the non-signatory subcontractors.
I point out to you that that is not the issue.

That

issue was never argued in any of the briefs, was never presented,
no cases were cited by either side, and the Court of Appeals
simply got the wrong issue.

The point is that the case exists

in state court against the subcontractors in the first place.
It is not a question of whether you have an arguably
valid claim against the subcontractors, but whether or not
that claim exists in state court.
And, in the second place, in our petition for recon­
sideration, we pointed out to the Court that certainly under
state law we have an arguably valid claim against the
subcontractors based on third-party beneficiary law and the
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

alternative cause of action in the state court of negligence

2

of the subcontractors.
My point was how — when the judge asked me the question

3
4

about the arguably valid claim, my statement was how can you

5

imagine that a subcontractor can come in and make a mess of

6

a wash plant, construct it defectively, and not have liability

7

to the people that own the wash plant and is having the work

8

done.

9

the point.

And, that is the cause of action.

But, that is not

10

That question was raised on the removal action and

11

was turned down by the district judge, exhaustively briefed.

12

The point in the removal action was an issue but not on the

13

issue of whether or not there were exceptional circumstances

14

to justify the stay.

15

The Court of Appeals further says that piecemeal

16

litigation will not be avoided because R&S could file separate

17

actions against the subcontractors.

18

can file third-party complaint in federal action against the

19

subcontractors.

20

And, R&S adds that Lake

I point out to you that these are imaginary cases

21

as opposed to the reality of the present circumstances.

22

is not in this case which cases may be filed, but rather what

23

cases have been filed.

24
25

It

And, on the basis of the cases that exist, this Court
should make a decision with respect to piecemeal litigation
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

whether it satisfactorily justifies the stay in view of all

2

the other circumstances.
QUESTION:

3
4

in the Court of Appeals/

5

MR. POLLY:

6

QUESTION:

7

Well, you lost on the piecemeal factor

That is correct.
They said they didn't think there would

be piecemeal litigation.

8

MR. POLLY:

9

QUESTION:

10

MR. POLLY:

No.
Do we have to second guess that?
No, Justice White.

I don't think that

11

is what the Court of Appeals said.

12

number one, that piecemeal litigation is not involved because

13

Lake does not have an arguably valid claim in state court against

14

the subcontractors.

15

if the arguably valid claim is not relevant, then piecemeal

16

litigation — that is the basis for the Court of Appeals.

17

They didn't say piecemeal litigation didn't occur under the

18

present circumstances if we have an arguably valid claim.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. POLLY:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. POLLY:

23

issue.

24

and, number two --

25

The Court of Appeals said,

If we have an arguably valid claim or

Well, I know, but they said you didn't.
Have an arguably valid claim?
Yes.

Do we have to second guess that?

No.

My point is that that is not the

The issue is that we do have a case in state court;

QUESTION:

I know.

The issue is — One of the factors

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

you consider is whether piecemeal litigation will be created.

2

MR. POLLY:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. POLLY:

And, the Court of Appeals concluded that,

The Court of Appeals concluded that we

did not have an arguably valid case.

7

8

And, we have a case —

no, it would not.

5

6

Exactly.

QUESTION:

And, therefore, there is no piecemeal

litigation.

9

MR. POLLY:

Exactly.

And, my statement to you is

10

that that ruling by the Court of Appeals was not the issue.

11

The issue is whether or not the case exists, not whether we

12

have an arguably valid claim.

13

QUESTION:

^he case does exist.

I don't — If the Court of

Appeals had

14

thought piecemeal litigation would occur, they might havd stayed

15

the case.

16

MR. POLLY:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. POLLY:

Yes.
But, they didn't.
They didn't.

But, the reasoning chey

19

gave as to saying that piecemeal litigation did not occur were

20

not at issue.

21

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Polly, can a plaintiff in a

22

state court action just name anyone who is a resident of the

23

state, however fraudulently and thereby defeat the right of

24

someone to remove to federal court?

25

MR. POLLY:

No, Justice O'Connor.

That is not the

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

point.

2

the first place and it is not —

3

The point is that we have the case in state court in

QUESTION:

Why can't the district court look at

4

whether there is a fraudulent joinder of someone in the state

5

court action?

6

MR. POLLY:

I pointed out, Justice O'Connor, that

7

the district judge did do that on removal.

But, the question

8

was not raised in the issue of stay.

9

sidetracked to that issue when it was not even in the case

And, the Court of Appeals

10

and there was no briefing on it.

11

and say you don't have a valid cause of action —

12

QUESTION:

To just come out of the blue

Are you saying that the Court of Appeals

13

took a contrary view to the district court when the district

14

court remanded or what were the arguments made at the district

15

court as to the grounds

16

fraudulent joinder point argued there?

17

MR. POLLY:

for removal and remanding?

Was the

Yes, the fraudulent joinder, that we

18

had no valid cause of action.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. POLLY:

The district court remanded.
Absolutely.

Said that we did have an

21

arguably valid claim and that that was for decision by the

22

state court.

23
24
25

And, my point has been that that is not an issue
in the Court of Appeals on the stay.
The rule of decision on the merits, federal law as
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

opposed to state law, obviously state law is strictly involved.

2

And, the adequacy of the state action to protect the rights,

3

there is no specific indication of prejudice here.

4

the state action under all the cases is adequate to protect

5

the rights and that matter was not at issue.

Certainly

The district court's findings for the stay were that

6
7

in fairness to the parties and to avoid multiplicity of judicial

8

time and effort and piecemeal litigation the stay was entered.

9

The district court also found that there was no good

10

cause shown to litigate in both courts, simply saying, as in

11

ail these cases, that there were no countervailing reasons

12

to outweigh proceeding, adjudicating, as opposed to the stay.

In other words, that there were no countervailing reasons such

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CLEON KILMER COMBS, ESQ.

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

Very well.

MR. COMBS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
At the outset, I would like to make it clear that
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Roberts & Schaefer initially perceived its right to a federal

2

forum when this action was first initiated in the state court.

3

We have pursued that view diligently right up to this Court.

4

We sought to remove for the very reason Mr. Polly

5

mentioned.

6

and weigh

7

followed this Court's admonition in Colorado River.

8

H. Cone instituted a separate federal action to exercise our

9

right to a federal forum which we conceived was granted to

We certainly did not want to leave any stone unturned
that

right and we did not.

10

us by the Congress.

11

QUESTION:

Upon remand we immediately
Moses

Mr. Combs, aren't the concerns that are

12

reflected by diversity jurisdiction satisfied fully by the

13

option of removing a case that has been filed in a state court

14

to a federal co irt under the removal power of the statute,

15

and if it turns out that removal is not possible because of

16

the absence of diversity, complete diversity in the state case,

17

do you think Congress Still intended that the defendant who

18

can't remove should be able to exercise diversity jurisdiction

19

in the federal court?

20

MR. COMBS:

I certainly do, Your Honor, and I think

21

this Court has so held in a number of cases.

22

that the factual situation is true, but —

23
24
25

QUESTION:

I don't know

I am not sure that this Court has ruled

on that actually.
MR. COMBS:

I don't know of any instance where that
20

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

particular factual situation has existed, but the rule of con­

2

current jurisdiction, the pending of parallel suits in state

3

and federal court, has been in existence for further back than

4

I would like to concede.

5

QUESTION:

But, shouldn't we look at what Congress

6

has addressed in the framework of the removal power and the

7

diversity jurisdiction statute, look at them together, because

8

Congress has spoken to both issues and don't they relate to

9

each other?

10

MR. COMBS:

I don't think so, Your Honor, because,

11

as we pointed out a moment ago, lawyers are a rather ingenious

12

group and many procedural situations can be developed to defeat

13

diversity jurisdiction as was true in this case.

14

And, the mere defeat o : removal jurisdiction does

15

not mean that the Congress did not intend for that participant,

16

that party, that citizens of another state, not to have a right

17

to a federal forum.

18

QUESTION:

Well, what if removal had been possible

19

under the circumstances of the case?

20

had been named, but instead of removing the action to the nearest

21

federal court in Kentucky, you had instead instituted a new

22

diversity action in the federal court in Illinois to be closer

23

to your corporate headquarters.

24

in your view?

25

MR. COMBS:

Suppose no subcontractors

Would that have been all right

There we have the Microsoft uase I believe
21

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

it is and certainly -- I think the action in Illinois would

2

be permissible as concurrent federal jurisdiction, but we have

3

a tool to deal with that and that is the right to transfer

4

that case to the most convenient forum which I think it would

5

be its return to Pikeville.

6

I would see no reason to dismiss or even stay that

7

case, but just simply transfer it to Pikeville.

8

would be my thinking on it, Your Honor.

9

At least that

Now, the problem that I am having, the initial problem,

10

and it is a problem that bothers the Court of Appeals, was

11

the shifting of the burden.

12

Roberts & Schaefer the burden of showing good cause for exercising

13

a right to a federal forum granted by the Congress.

14

The district court imposed upon

And, in our view, a right to a federal forum granted

15

by the Congress, federal jurisdiction, is not subject to any

16

presumption which must be overcome.

17
18
19

The Court of Appeals so held ana we suggest that
that is the proper rule.
QUESTION:

Mr. Combs, can I ask you a question that

20

related to what Justice O'Connor was asking you?

21

as I understand, and you persuaded the Court of Appeals, that

22

there was no arguably valid claim involving the subcontractors.

23

MR. COMBS:

24

QUESTION:

25

You contend,

Yes, we do, Your Honor.
Now, if you had been successful in per­

suading the district court of that effect at the time of your
22

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2
3
4

effort to remove, would you not have been successful in removing?
MR. COMBS:

We think so, Your Honor.

That is why

we asserted it.
QUESTION:

Then, does it not appear that the effect

5

of what you have done is to get appellate review of the district

6

court's — as you would say — erroneous decision on removal?

7

MR. COMBS:

I suggest not, Your Honor, because if

8

there is parallel federal jurisdiction, concurrent jurisdiction —

9

This case is a case which was instituted in the federal court

10

under a statute granting us a federal forum and the appeal

11

is from that corner and not from the other.

12

QUESTION:

But, is it not true that — not probable

13

at least that if the Court of Appeals had agreed with the district

14

court's remand Drder and thought that these parties were

15

genuine — there was a genuine separate lawsuit against the

16

two subcontractors it would have decided the appeal differently?

17

It seems to me the whole question of where you litigate turns

18

on the bona fxdes of the claims against the subcontractors.

19

MR. COMBS:

I don't really think it does, Your Honor,

20

because certainly the question of the subcontractors is —

21

The main thrust of this case and this claim really is this

22

contract —

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. COMBS:

25

Right.
— between these two parties that we

have before us here today.

And, the question is Roberts &
23

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY INC

1

Schaefer's right to a federal forum by virtue of diversity

2

to determine that controversy.
And, I don't think that — What you are referring

3
4

to, I take it, is whether that is sufficient exceptional circum­

5

stances.

6

I submit that it is not.
QUESTION:

Well, what is troubling me — It seems

7

to me that Congress is giving us conflicting signals.

On one

8

hand, they say you have got a right to a federal forum in a

9

diversity case, on the other hand, they say if you try to remove

10

and you fail you don't get any appeal from an order denying

11

removal or remanding the case.

12

MR. COMBS:

That would be the effect.

Actually,

13

if that were held, then we would be denied on both ends of

14

the spectrum.

15

have been ridiculous for me to attempt to remove.

16

have just gone ahead and immediately filed.

17

We would be denied relief both ways and it would

QUESTION:

I should

Well, it wouldn't have been ridiculous,

18

but it would, in effect, say that a decision on a question

19

like this is lodged in the district court and not normally

20

going to be reviewable and if you happen to lose maybe a different

21

district judge would have decided it otherwise.

22

I think there is a close question on your removal.

23

perfectly clear he was right in denying you removal.

24
25

MR. COMBS:

In other words,
It it not

I think that is true, Your Honor, and

I would like to point out that the heavy burden was on Lake

If they wanted a stay, a heavy burden was to

And, the record is virtually silent

As a matter of fact, it is silent.

That burden was

And, the Court of Appeals recognized that and spoke

7

to it and held expressly that it was not met.

8

the Court of Appeals put that to rest at that point.

9

There is no claim of abstention here.

And, we think

We don't have

10

any Berford claim, we don't have any Younger claim.

11

have an exceptional circumstances claim.

12

addressed, but actually what was addressed is merely left,

13

and as we know, the point where a federal court draws the line

14

and refuses to act in a race case is where the race — the

15

property is in the actual possession of a state court and is

16

being administered by the state court.

17

circumstances, a federal court should and will abstain.

18

QUESTION:

The in personam was

Certainly, under those

What if the stcy in the federal court

19

had not been granted?

20

the two suits should go on simultaneously.

MR. COMBS:

QUESTION:

We do

I take it your position would be that

Yes, Your Honor.
Litigating the same issue in each court

23

and whoever -- whichever arrived at judgment first would then

24

conclude the other.

25

MR. COMBS:

You would have the proverbial race to

1

the judgment.

We had a race to the courthouse and I lost.

2

I guess we would have a race to the judgment.

3

QUESTION:

4

way to run a judicial system?
MR. COMBS:

5

6

Well, does that seem to you like a sensible

No, Your Honor, but we do have a federal

system and —
QUESTION:

7

If you say no, it is not a sensible way

8

to run a judicial system, then there must be something wrong

9

with the doctrines you are — and say that is what should have

10
11
12
13

happened.
MR. COMBS:

I think the compelling issue is whether

a litigant is entitled to a federal forum.
QUESTION:

You say he is entitled to a federal forum

14

come hell or high water regardless of totally duplicative

15

litigation in the state court.

16

MR. COMBS:

I suggest, Your Honor, that is a political

17

argument as most of these things are and really addresses itself

18

to the Congress.

19

QUESTION:

And, you think Congress would have been

20

deeply pleased with this spectacle of litigation, identical

21

litigation, running its course both in the Kentucky state court

22

and in the federal district court.

23

MR. COMBS:

I would hope the Congress would not be

24

pleased, Your Honor, but then my remedy — the only remedy

25

I know is to write my congressman because the jurisdiction
26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

of the federal courts is vested exclusively in the Congress.

2

I would like to speak to that later.

3

QUESTION:

Don't you think the congressman might

4

respond and tell you we have spoken and we have written the

5

removal statute and it is linked to the diversity statute and

6

we have denied the right of appeal from an order under the

7

removal power and that is it, we have spoken?

8

have to implement these statutes together and make them work.

9

MR. COMBS:

Now, you courts

Your Honor, I don't read the diversity —

10

The original diversity statute and the removal of diversity

11

statute as being — You can choose one or the other —

12

QUESTION:

Well, read them together.

I mean, is

13

there anything wrong with that and with the argument that,

14

indeed, Congress has a right to speak and it did speak.

15

MR. COMBS:

I am sorry, Your Honor, I am having trouble

16

following your last question.

17

QUESTION:

18
19

question.

Well, it was more a comment than a

Thank you.
MR. COMBS:

I am suggesting that the Congress has

20

said you may remove if it is removable.

21

you have diversity jurisdiction otherwise, you may institute

22

a separate parallel proceeding.

23

If it is not, and

That is what we have done.

And, we suggest that once the Congress determines

24

that jurisdiction dees exist, that there is the often spoken,

25

unflagging obligation to proceed and we think that is what
27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

2

should have happened in this case.
Now, I would like to address for a moment, if I may,

3

the exceptional circumstances situation.

4

by exceptional circumstances because they are in the eye of

5

the beholder.

6

and it becomes entangled and enmeshed with discretion.

7

And, I recognize for a lawyer to address a court and suggest

8
9

It all depends on whose circumstances they are

that there is no discretion is hazardous at best.
But, I suggest that constitutionally there is no

10

discretion with regard to jurisdiction.

11

part of jurisdiction.

12

And, I am troubled

Discretion is an innate

Jurisdiction, in my view, is a mandate to a court

13

to act and adjudicate an adjudicable controversy.

14

what we have here.

15

QUESTION:

That is

Mr. Combs, you said you thought constitu­

16

tionally there could be no discretion.

17

could not have said when it passed the statutes for the purpose

18

of conferring jurisdiction on the district court that t.ie district

19

court should have jurisdiction to stay the case where there

20

would be dupldcative litigation?

21

MR. COMBS:

Do you mean that Congress

I think they could very well have done

22

so, Your Honor, and maybe that is the answer.

23

that is a political decision.

24

QUESTION:

25

But, there again,

But, at any rate, it is not any constitutional

doctrine that you -- Congress couldn't have achieved this -28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. COMBS:

No.

What I am saying is that there is

2

presently a constitutional prohibition against exercising a

3

discretion.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. COMBS:

Where do we find that in the Constitution?
You find it in the area where matters

6

of jurisdiction are withheld and granted to the Congress.

7

And, when the Congress determines jurisdiction, the Congress

8

determines whether jurisdiction shall exist in this case, whether

9

jurisdiction shall not exist in the next case, whether it shall

10

exist with discretion to stay in the third case.

11
12

In other words, the entire spectrum of jurisdiction
power rests with the Congress and not with any court.

13

QUESTION:

So,- in your view, cases from this Court

14

like the Younger or Pullman abstention cases are all erroneously

15

decided?

16

MR. COMBS:

17

QUESTION:

18
19

No, Your Honor, but —
And the Colorado River factors c ise as

well.
MR. COMBS:

Addressing that specifically, I view —

20

Of course, Younger, Berford and the other abstention cases

21

are bottomed on the concept of the separation of the federal

22

government and state government and the operation of the state

23

government, the non-interference, the non-intrusion of the

24

federal government into the vital affairs of the state.

25

I agree with those cases.
29

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And,

1

Now, when I start having a little trouble is with

2

Colorado River and Arizona, because in Colorado River and in

3

Arizona the Court used the exceptional circumstances test.

4

In my mind, exceptional circumstances is almost tantamount

5

to discretion.

6

pointedly says that it is the narrowest of discretion.

7

It may be discretion, although the Court very

And, again, I am back to the constitutional problem,

8

the jurisdictional problem, of discretion.

9

Declaratory Judgment Act, the Brillhart case, the Congress

10

granted the discretion and the court exercised it and this

11

Court upheld it.

12

Certainly in the

So, I would suggest that Colorado River and Arizona

13

maybe are closer akin, or what we in Kentucky call kissing

14

cousins, of Berford and some of the civil counterparts of

15

Younger where the state has a vital interest, because having

16

practiced for a short time in Arizona, I know what water rights

17

mean.

18

And, as this Court pointed out in Arizona, that is

19

a very — I forget the terminology, but it is unique.

20

here, Colorado and Arizona were attempting to establish through

21

the state court system a pattern of water rights which this

22

Court held provided exceptional circumstances.

23

that maybe more appropriate it should have been intrusion into

24

areas that should be reserved for the states.

25

And,

I would suggest

And, I would suggest that if — I don't think it
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

is a discretion, but I think the federal courts, when they

2

come into an area of that sort, they should look into it and

3

make a determination, a finding of fact, if you please, not

4

a discretion, but a finding of fact as to whether there will

5

be an intrusion into the vital functions of the state which

6

might well be contrary to the comity between the federal

7

government and the states.

8
9

Now, the state law issue, I think, should be put
to rest and I think can be put to rest very quickly.

That

10

is what Erie is all about.

11

is all about.

12

based on state law, we w^uld repeal the diversity statute and

13

we all know that is an area reserved for the Congress.

14

That is what the diversity statute

If we were to stay every case because it is

Conservation of judicial time:

That is extremely

15

interesting to me because ten years ago this very month I was

16

standing here in the same spot defending Judge Hermensdorfer

17

and Judge Hermensdorfer didn't have time and he vas serious

18

and he meant it.

19

But, this Court wisely determined that the Congress

20

had spoken, that the conferring of jurisdictions in diversity

21

of removal cases was a mandate of the Congress which he should

22

have heeded and ordered him to heed it.

23

Certainly, these things are sometimes wasteful, waste

24

of time, waste of money.

25

but again that addresses itself to the Congress and not to

Maybe there should be better ways,

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

us.

2

Another thing that bothers me is — Of course, the

3

Microsoftware case I mentioned a moment ago, I misnamed it.

4

Another matter I would like to cover briefly is diversity

5

jurisdiction and its relationship to federal questions, civil

6

rights, whatever.

7

I mention in my brief and I would like to emphasize

8

now that I know of no jurisdictional pecking order, I know

9

of no jurisdictional statute that says diversity shall be tried

10

first, second, or third, whether it should be number one or

11

number ten on the list of one to ten.

12

And, I think in the absence of a congressional expres­

13

sion, we must treat each jurisdictional — each conferring

14

in jurisdiction as a congressional mandate of at least equal

15

equality.

16

The jurisdiction that I advocate today happens to

17

be ^a senior citizen,

18

certainly the mere factor that it may have here and may not

19

even be in great favor in a lot of places, doesn't mean that

20

it is to be condemned or moved to the back of the bus.

21

the most senior of all,

Certainly, as a senior citizens,

C suppose, but

it is entitled to

22

as much consideration and is entitled to go forward with at

23

least the same deliberate speed to adjudication as any other

24

jurisdiction unless the Congress mandates otherwise as it has

25

in a few instances.
32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

It distresses me to see judgments made by the

2

individual districts or even the circuits as to which should

3

take precedence, which should be first, which should be second,

4

which should ninth, which should be tenth.

5

a political decision for the Congress and not for the courts.

6

I would suggest that all jurisdictional mandates move forward

7

equally unless and until the Congress dictates otherwise.

8
9
10

I notice the Colorado District in Local Rule 200
says that diversity actions will be given the lowest priority
and will be heard and tried when, as, and if time permits.

11

12

I think that is

Again, I suggest that is a judgment for the Congress
and not for the courts.

13

I am suggesting that the Sixth Circuit has decided

14

the case correctly, has decided that the congressional mandate

15

of the Congress should be enforced and has properly reversed

16

the district court with directions to exercise jurisdiction.

If the Court has nothing further, may I be excus>3d?

piecemeal litigation.

2

Let me point out to this Court that the district

3

judge in this case found that piecemeal litigation exists.

4

Not only did the Court of Appeals find that it did not exist

5

but the district judge found that it did exist specifically

6

in his stay order.

7

The question is not whether the Court of Appeals

8

made that finding and could make that finding.

9

is whether or not the Court of Appeals was correct.

10

The question

The issue is whether or not the district judge abused

11

his discretion in finding that piecemeal litigation occurred.

12

And, yes, this Court must determine whether or not the Court

13

of Appeals was correct in ruling that the district judge abused

14

his discretion in finding that piecemeal litigation exists.
