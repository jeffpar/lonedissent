For the other groups of risky people

The events giving rise to this case that

12

ultimately implicated

13

began in 1971, when the Appellee voluntarily entered a

14

psychiatric hospital.

15

involuntarily committed, after suffering what was

16

described as an acute mental breakdown, a condition that

17

was diagnosed as an acute schizophrenic episode with

paranoid features.

Shortly thereafter, he was

He ultimately was released from the hospital,

after a stay of a little more than three weeks.

22

advised to continue outpatient therapy.

In

At the

1982, Appellee tried to buy a gun from a

24

federally licensed firearms dealer.

The dealer refused

25

to complete the sale after Appellee acknowledged on a

1

standard Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms form

2

that he had once been committed to a mental

3

institution.

4

When Appellee then sought relief from BATF, he

5

was informed that his prior commitment subjected him to

6

a permanent federal firearms disqualificaticn that could

7

not be waived by the agency .

8

bringing this suit in district court, claiming that the

9

firearm disqualification as created by the gun control

The Appellee responded by

10

statutes violated his Fiftn Amendment rights to equal

11

protection and due process.
The district court agreed with the Appellee on

12
13

both grounds.

The court concluded, in a lengthy dictum,

14

that former mental patients are a quasi-suspect class

15

for equal protection analysis.

16

hold that Title IV is entirely irrational because it

17

makes relief available to some felons, but not to people

18

with a history of mental illness.

The court went on to

The court also went on in an alternative

19

20

holding to conclude that Title IV makes use of an

21

unconstitutional irrebuttable presumption because it

22

does not make provision for people who have been

23

committed in the past to prove that they are no longer

24

dangerous.

25

As a result of these conclusions,

the court

5

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

invalidatad all of the provisions of Title IV that

2

create firearms disqualifications on the basis of mental

3

disorder, a conclusion that apparently permits current

4

as well as past psychiatric patients to obtain

5

firearms.

6

.
This Court has addressed these firearms

disqualifications on a number of occasions, and each
.time it has emphasized that Congress legislated as
broadly as possible because it believed that only

10

sweeping disqualification would be effective in keeping

11

guns away from dangerous people.

12

The district court ignored that Congressional

13

understanding in holding essentially that Title IV is

14

unconstitutional because it is insufficiently precise.

15

Whether this holding was correct requires the

16

consideration of two questions.

17

The first is whether Congress acted

18

irrationally as an initial matter in listing people with

19

a history of mental illness among the presumptively

20

dangerous categories of people who are affected by the

21

firearms disqualification.

22

Assuming that Congress acted properly in doing

23

that, the second question is whether it was nonetheless

24

under some kind of constitutional obligation to create

25

an exception to this prophylactic rule for people who
6

(202) 628-9300

1

claim that they can establish that

2

dangerous.

3

they are no longer

In cur view, the answer to both of these

4

questions is plainly no.

5

Is not really disputed here, that Congress acted

6

rationally in prohibiting people with a history of

7

commitment from acquiring firearms.

8

Court’s decisions in O’Connor versus Donaldson and

9

Addington versus Texas, a history of commitment has

As to the first question, it

At least since this

10

involved a commitment decision based on clear and

11

convincing evidence that the committee posed a danger cf

12

some sort to himself or others.
Even Appellee’s commitment here in 1971, which

13
14

predated

15

his attending physician and by the staff of the medical

16

institution that he posed a potential danger to himself,

17

to others, or to property, as well, apparently, as a

18

judicial finding that he was a threat to himself or to

19

society.

those decisions, required a conclusion both by

QUESTION;

20

Well, isn’t the core issue here

21

whether the statute is infirm because it didn’t provide

22

any kind of alternative for persons previously adjudged

23

mentally deficient?

24
25

MR. ROTHFELDs
Honor.

I think that’s correct. Your

The district court itself acknowledged that

(202) 628-9300

1

Congress acted rationally in using the history of mental

2

illness as a trigger for Title IV's prophylactic rules,

3

and it, as you suggested, went off entirely cn the

proposition that no

provision had been added to

The Appellee has suggested in his brief that

6
7

it may have been irrational as an initial matter for

8

Congress to have listed people in this category as a

9

presumptive matter in Title IV.

And I'm suggesting now

10

I think that that is easily disposed of and in fact, as

11

we suggest, was not taken seriously by the district

12

court.

13

Certainly it is true that, in light of the

14

meaning of the commitment decision. Congress acts

15

rationally in prohbiting people who have been committed

16

or who are currently under an order of commitment from

17

getting guns.

18

cure of mental Illness and the fallibility and

19

uncertainty of psychiatric diagnosis and treatment,

20

which this Court has repeatedly recognized, Congress

21

could act justifiably in concluding that someone whose

22

mental disorder rose to a level requiring commitment

23

should, at least as a presumptive matter as we suggest,

24

not be entitled to acquire firearms.

25

Ani given the relatively low rates of

1

district court more troubling, question is this case,

2

whether, having created and permissibly created this

3

broad prophylactic rule. Congress was constitutionally

4

obligated to carve out exceptions for people who believe

5

that the rule is unfair as applied to them.

6

falls into that category.

Appellee

And that is what the district court

7

8

concluded.

It felt that there was such a constitutional

9

obligation on Congress.

Now, in reaching that

10

conclusion the court focused on 18 U.S.C. Section

11

925(c), which is the provision that makes relief for the

12

permanent firearms disqualification available to the

13

less dangerous group of felons.

14

The court decided that it was entirely

15

irrational for Congress to make relief available to any

16

subcategory of felons while withholding it from people

17

that had a history of mental illness.

18

QUESTION*

Suppose the process by which he had

19

been declared mentally disturbed had been modified and

20

repudiated.

21

this statute?

22

Would he be able to get a license under

NR. ROTHFELDs,

Well,

I think not, Your Honor.

23

In fact, the commitment procedure in New Jersey has

24

changed since the time of Appellee’s commitment,

25

this Court has recognized additional constitutional
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

and

1

requirements since then.
But I think Congress couli justifiably rely on

2
3

the type of ccmraitment procedure that, for example, was

4

applied to the Appellee here in determining that it gave

5

some presumption of dangerousness to the person who was

6

committed.

7

commitment proceeding involved a finding by a judicial

8

officer that the person who .had been committed posed a

9

danger to himself and

It necessarily involved — even a flawed

to others, and that is the type of

10

factor that Congress certainly is entitled to take into

11

account in deciding who should have access to firearms.

12

The district court's focus here was not really

13

on the nature of the commitment decision or the

14

procedures that were used by Hew Jersey, but on the fact

15

that the federal statute provides relief to one subgroup

16

of people affected by the disqualification and not to

17

others, not to people with a history of mental illness.

18

And the court decided

19

a stereotypical ani inaccurate notion that mental

20

illness is always incurable in every case.

21

that that must have been based on

But this sort of analysis by the district

22

court simply ignored the actual Congressional intent in

23

creating the firearms disqualifications, as well as the

24

unique factual characteristics of the mentally ill that

25

set them apart from the other groups of presumptively
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

dangerous people listed in Titles IV and VII.
The court failed to recognize that this

2
3

Section 925(c), the relief provision, is a very narrow

4

provision.

5

dangerous felons who had used weapons during the

6

commission of their crime.

It withholds relief entirely from more

It also makes relief completely unavailable to

7
8

all of the other specially risky categories affected by

9

the gun control, not only committees and former

10

committees such as the Appellee here, but people who

11

have been dishonorably discharged from the armed

12

services, people who have renounced their American

13

citizenship.

14

The Congress obviously recognized that

15

everyone in each of

these categories would not misuse a

16

firearm were he able to obtain one, but -QUESTION*

17

Mr. Eothfeld, is legislation

18

pending presently in Congress to change this scheme

19

somewhat?

20

MR. ROTHFELDi

There are now three bills

21

pending in Congress, Justice O'Connor, one of which has

22

passed the Senate ani

23

reported out by the House Judiciary Committee, which

24

would modify Section 925(c).

25

QUESTION*

another one of which has been

With respect to former mental
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

patients?
MR. ROTHFELD*

2

Yes, it would make relief

3

available, not only to former mental patients, but to

4

all of the people subject to firearms disqualification.

5

And the Congress has not as yet taken final action on

6

that, and the bills differ as to their retroactive

7

effect as well.

8

are further developments legislatively.

But we will inform the Court if there

In fact, the point that you bring up, that

9

10

Section 925(c) is being considered now by Congress,

11

suggests one of the flaws in what the district court

12

did.

13

narrow response to a very specific problem faced by

14

corporate firearms manufacturers, who would be forced

15

out of business altogether if they had been convicted of

16

a felony, even one unrelated to their firearms

17

operations.

18

Congress — 925(c) was originally enacted as a

After several years of experience with that

19

narrow provision, Congress expanded it to benefit a

20

larger, but still very small, subcategory of felons.

21

And that is the sort of legislation, one step at a time,

22

that this Court has repeatedly upheld against equal

23

protection challenges.

24
25

The fact that Congress stopped, at least at
this point, after fixing a defect that it saw in the
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

felony disqualification doesn't render the rest of

2

Titles IV and VII unconstitutional, any more than

3

Congress* failure to list every imaginable group of

4

presumptively dangerous people in Titles IV and VII when

5

it initially passed them renders invalid the very

6

reasonable restrictions that it did create.

7

And again, the fact that Congress is currently

8

considering additional modifications to 925(c) that

9

would provide the Appellee with all of the relief that

10

he is currently seeking in court confirms that this scrt

11

of line-drawing is a quintassantially legislative

12

process, that the district court should not have

13

involved itself in.

14

QUESTION!

But the statute is a permanent bar

15

to the acquisition of guns by anybody who's been

16

hospitalized for mental illness?

17

HR. RGTHFELDi

That's correct, at the moment

18

anyone who's been involuntarily committed, that's

19

correct.

20
21

22

QUESTIONS

And the district court I take it

Invalidated that entire disqualification?
HR. ROTHFELDs

The district court’s — the

23

relief that was provided by the district court is a

24

little bit ambiguous.

25

didn’t have the authority to simply order BATF to create

The court concluded that it

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

some sort of administrative mechanism that would allow

2

someone such as Appellee to prove he is no longer

3

dangerous.

4

The court decided it simply had tc invalidate

5

the provisions that regulate -- in fact create the

6

disqualifications on the basis of mental disorder, and

7

it therefore in terms struck down all of the provisions

8

in the district court's order that prevent the Appellee

9

from purchasing firearms.

10
11
12

QUESTIONS

Do you think some narrower relief

could have been provided?
MR. ROTHFELDs

We suggest in oar brief,

13

Justice White, that of course the Court doesn't have tc

14

reach the guestion unless it concludes that there was a

15

constitutional violation.

16

that the relief that was granted was grossly out of

17

proportion to the constitutional violation that the

18

court found.

But if it does, cur view is

19

As a mattec of equal protection, I think this

20

Court's cases show clearly that the proper remedy would

21

have been either to extend the relief provision to

22

people in Appellee's category or to foreclose relief

23

altogether for all people who are subject tc firearms

24

disqualification.

25

And even as a matter of due process — the
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

court also found a due process violation — it clearly

2

would have been the Congressional intent that the

3

presumptions, the disqualifications, created by Title IV

4

not invalidate it altogether.

5

of situation that the remedy chosen by the district

6

court was inappropriate.

And I think in that sort

The court should have —

10

12

MR. ROTHFELD*

Well, there is currently such a

13

provision in Section 925(c)

14

dangerous category of felons.

15

the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that

16

they would be capable of handling a gun in a manner not

17

dangerous to the public and that it would otherwise be

in the public interest to waive the firearm

disqualification.

MR. ROTHFELDi

7

That was the court’s stated

reasoning.

The court recognized that what it was doing

9

was completely inconsistent with the Congressional

10

intent and the basic permissible statutory scheme.

11

since in our view the court was clearly wrong in

judgment about its power, if the Court, if this Court

ever reaches the question,

17

analysis which we hope convinces this Court not to reach

18

the remedy question, the court, even apart from the

19

legislative background, the evolution of Section 925(c),

20

ignored the significant reasons for withholding

While

10

mental disorder requires an exercise of fallible

11

psychiatric diagnosis and notoriously unreliable

12

psychiatric predictions about an individual's long-term

13

future dangercusness.

14

And this problem is compounded by the fact» as

15

this case illustrates, that cures often Involve

16

continuation of drug or other types of therapy which are

17

voluntary.

18

prudently conclude, as it did, that the state of

19

psychiatry simply does not permit prediction with

20

anything near certainty that a person who has been

21

committed in the past will not again prove dangerous to

22

himself or others in the future.

23

Given these factors. Congress could

illness appear to be disproportionately high, and it is

2

generally acknowledged that the arrest rates of people

3

who have been committed and released from mental

4

institutions are significantly higher than those of the

5

general population.

6

While the briefs explain that there is

7

currently a controversy raging in the psychiatric

8

community about the causes of these phenomenon, the very

9

existence of these differential rates and the conclusion

10

of some researchers that mental illness correlates

11

directly with a propensity for greater violence gives

12

Congress all the support it needed to support its

13

judgment that people with a history of mental illness

14

are a presumptively risky group.

15

In this situation, where the category of

16

people affected by the classifications presents an

17

ideatifiably risk to the public, where the success of

18

the Congressional purpose requires the use of broad

19

prophylactic relief, where any single mistake would have

20

catastrophic consequences for the public. Congress was

21

entitled to act with all the caution it deemed necessary

22

in lifting firearms lisgualifications.

That’s true.

MR. ROTHFELDs

I believe that’s correct.

I

13

think the type of prophylactic rule that Congress

14

created here, similar to the felony provisions the Court

15

interpreted in New Banner most recently. Congress was

16

looking for something that was easily applied and that

17

would be probative.

18

And I think it concluded reasonably that

19

anyone whose mental disorder was serious enough to

20

affect his ability to use firearms would likely have

21

been committed in the past, or that that would at least

22

be a valid indicator.

Well, it's certainly true that

the disqualifications in Titles IV and VII don't reach

everyone in society who’s dangerous and shouldn’t be

13

able to obtain a gun.

14

think, prophylactic rules that focused on the most

15

dangerous groups whe were easily identifiable, that

16

included felons and the others that I've mentioned, and

17

that includes people who have been actually adjudicated

18

incompetent or requiring commitment.

19

But Congress was creating, I

I think the fact that Congress could have gene

of a psychiatrist involving a much more subjective and

unreliable opinion about long-term future

dangerousness.

17

That's the sort of thing Congress wanted to

avoid by focusing with pacticalarity on whether or not

suggesting that predictions about long-term

unreasonable, and decided to do it gradually, and said

that for the first year people whose names begin with A

I submit further that the failure to grant
that review proceiare by Congress to those who were
committed is due to Congress* reliance upon the
stereotype of mental illness, and that is clearly

Over the past number of years, there have been recent

several years, generally attempting to eliminate

against the mentally ill.
