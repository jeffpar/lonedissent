ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD J. ALIEN, ESQ.,

7

OK BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. ALLENt

8
9

please the Court, Mr.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
Heath was indicted in Georgia for

10

the murder of his wife after joint investigation between

11

Alabama and Georgia officials for capital murder.
The same day that he was indicted, a notice cf

12

13

aggravating circumstance was filed by the state, which

14

is the method by which Georgia indicates its intent to

15

seek the death penalty.
Some time later, he pleaded guilty to that

16
17

murder, and we now reach a factual nuarce that will take

18

me a minute or so to explore of some significance.

19

the state's brief they assert in Page > 10, 31, and 32

20

that the defendant pled guilty to life imprisonment.

21

That is not supported by the record, and if it is

22

supported by the record, it causes the state a bit of a

23

dilamm a .

24
25

The record shows that he pled guilty to
murder, and then it is uncontradicted that he went

In

through what is called the unified appeals procedure,

2

which is the method by which Georgia -- these are

3

hearings by which they decide if the death penalty is tc

4

be imposed, and subsequently a life sentence was

5

impose d .

6

I think the reason the state asserts that he

7

pled guilty tc the life sentence is they indicate or at

8

least argue that he was never in jeopardy for his life,

9

whereas in fact the record supports that he was, but

10

mere importantly, suppose the government is right.

11

Suppose the state of Alabama is correct that he did

12

plead guilty to life imprisonment.

13

Under those circumstances,

the dilemma that

14

the state faces is either that they are essentially

15

conceding that their agents denied a trial, that there

16

was a plea agreement, committed perjury, or if it was

17

somebody other than these agents who entered into the

18

pl^a agreement, serious questions of immunity are

19

raised, because obviously if there was an agreement in

20

Georgia, it would contain, at least implicitly,

21

statements about immunity, and if that is the case, one

22

of the issues that this Court would face should it apply

23

the dual sovereignty doctrine to successive state

24,

prosecutions is how to work, out those kinds of questions

25

of immunity.

QUESTION*

What would you say, Hr. Allen,

if

the record showed that there was a kidnapping and rape

in one state, either Georgia or Alabama,

5

would your view be the same?

MR. ALLENs

I think it is quite clear.

Your

13

Honor, for reasons I am going to develop in detail,

14

we have to respect territoriality in the criminal

15

justice process, and that under those circumstances, the

15

murder occurred in the one state, the kidnapping and

11

rape occurred in another.

13

that

the

Now, if one of thos ? acts is not an element of

U

the defense, and is relevant somehow to the sentencing

23

process, then it strikes me that the territoriality

2I

principle would not restrict the state from considering

21

that element in its decision to reach a conclusion of

23

capital punishment.

21
25

The interesting fact in this case is that the
sentencing criteria in this case is the kidnapping.

QUESTION;

17

MR. ALLEN;

In Georgia?
That’s right.

New, I would like

18

tc address my remarks to three issues.

19

the concerns of the double jeopardy clause are more

20

acute here than in any other situation where this Court

21

has dealt with the dual sovereignty doctrine, the

22

concerns of the individual.

23

First of all,

Commensurately, the concerns of the state are

Would you be here?

MR. ALLENi

6

Hr. Allen, let me interrupt you

No, sir.

And further, as I was

7

saying, would call into question — a decision in favor

8

of Alabama would call into question precedents of this

9

Court.

10

The third point that I will make today is that

11

by contrast a decision for Mr. Heath would essentially

12

cast doubt on no precedents of this Court and maintain

13

the status quo in the administration of criminal justice

14

in the United States.

15

The reason the defendant's interests are more

16

acute here than in other circumstances where this Court

17

has dealt with the dual sovereignty exception is, first

18

of all, here we have what is probably the pristine

19

problem of the double jeopardy clause, apparently

20

repeated efforts to deprive a person cf his life.

21

In most instances where the dual sovereignty

22

exception has been applied, that is not the case, and of

23

course that raises an increased risk of an erroneous

24

death sentence that has not been dealt with before by

25

this Court, but more importantly than that,

a second

20 F ST., N.V'., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-930u

1

reason why the defendant’s interests are more acute here

2

is that the state purports to ask you to extend the dual

3

sovereignty exception to successive state prosecutions.

4

But that is not what they are asking you to

5

do.

multiple sovereignty exception.

7

argument, the fact that there are only two states

8

involved in this case is a complete fortuity.

9

What they are asking you to do is in fact create a
Under the state’s

If states are allowed to be freed from

the

10

constraints of double jeopardy clause when a sister

11

state has taken cognizance of that exact same act, the

12

result could be that an individual could be tried for

13

the same offense across a multitude of states.

14

A perfect example is, if a person is

15

kidnapped, to pick up some of the examples already used

16

today and carry it across three different jurisdictions,

17

each of those jurisdictions would have jurisdiction over

18

the kidnapping, and presumably if there is a murder that

19

follows, to try that individual for the capital offense

20

of the murder.

21

So, we are talking here not about a dual

sovereignty exception.

And as this Court held — or discussed, did

MR. ALLEN;

free to think, that all due process issues are properly

before you, but something tells me I shouldn't view it

that way.

explain to me your opponent's argument as to how Alabama •

gets sovereignty?

that says that a crime that commences in Alabama they

have jurisdiction of, even if it is consummated outside

21

the state.

22

commenced with the kidnapping, which occurred, if it

23

occurred at all, in Alabama, and therefore they say this

24

is a single crime, murder during a kidnapping, and they

25

have jurisdiction over it.

They say that this crime of the murder

QUESTION:

I don’t assert.

I was simply

asking you a question.
MR. ALLEN:

And the answer is that those cases

4

are old cases, but the reason they are old cases is

5

because the principal of territoriality that they

6

constructed, or I shouldn’t say constructed, simply

7

recognized, has never been cast into doubt.

3

A perfect example of this is, after diligent

9

search I and I presume my friend from Alabama have not

10

been able to find a single case other than this case of

11

an extraterritorial assertion of jurisdiction over a

12

murder that occurred outside the state.

13

QUESTION:

Well, why should — as a matter of

14

principle, why should it be any different in a criminal

15

case than in a civil case, if you are talking about

16

“jurisdiction" apart from double jeopardy

17

considerations?

18

MR. ALLEN:

If there is a reason, the reason

19

is, is that one has always interpreted the criminal

20

process, the statutes constructing the criminal process

21

in a narrow way.

22

you allow an analogy to civil jurisdiction, what you

be a dramatic change in the administration of criminal

justice to hold that criminal justice jurisdiction,

8

jurisdiction over criminal acts is somehow analogous to

these cases indicates how dramatic a change

be .

I believe, and it was not.

And by hypothesis they were dealing

with an act that took place in a territory ever which

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM DUNCAN LITTLE, III, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
HR. LITTLE:

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice,

8

and may it please the Court, despite petitioner's

9

argument, this is a straightforward case.

There is only

10

one issue here, and that is whether where one act

11

violates the law of two different governments or two

12

different sovereign governments, there are two different

13

offenses, or whether double jeopardy -- excuse me,

14

whether the dual sovereignty doctrine applies to an act

15

which violates the law of two different states.

16

As petitioner conceded, the issue of

17

jurisdiction was not raised in the courts below.

18

not addressed’ by the Alabama courts at all.

19

raised in the petition for certiorari.

20

22

existence of jurisdiction.

23

It was

This Court

Now, this Court's dual sovereignty doctrine as

24

it has been established is very clear and very logical.

25

Where one act violates the law of two different

sovereign governments, there are two different offenses

2

for purposes cf the double jeopardy clause.

3

governmnts are sovereign in relation tc one another

4

where each derives its authority to prosecute from a

5

different source.

6

Two

This Court in United States versus Lanza and

7

in Abbate versus United States has held that states

8

derive their authority to prosecute from their own

9

const!tutions.

Now, here we have Alabama and Georgia,

10

two states each deriving their authority to prosecute

11

from their own constitutions.

12

under the dual sovereignty doctrine, and therefore there

13

is no double jeopardy violation.

14

These are sovereigns

Furthermore, this is not only clear, it makes

15

sense.

16

focus has been on the legal distinction between the

17

statutes, whether these statutes are legally different.

18

For instance, under Blcckburger, the question there is

19

whether each statute includes an element cf proof which

20

is not included in the other statute.

21

In this Court's other double jeopardy cases,

the

Now, here we have two laws which are legally

22

distinct in the most basic sense.

23

passed by the Alabama legislature pursuant to the

24

Alabama constitution.

25

by the Georgia legislature.

The other is a Georgia law passed

different offenses for purposes of the double jeopardy

2

clause .

3

Now, the petitioner wuuld have the Court

4

discard all the clear language of these cases and

5

instead decide this case based on other factors.

6

would like to discuss these individually.

7

I

First is the idea of comparison of interest.

8

Petitioner says that two prosecutions should only be

9

allowed where the two governments are pursuing different

10

interests, and where one government's interests are not

11

served by another government.

12

for a number cf reasons.

13

This should be rejected

First, it is totally contrary to what the

14

court has already said in this area.

15

the dual sover ;ignty cases is on sovereignty, and the

16

focal question is, are the governments sovereign in

17

relation to one another.

18

that the peti-i ioner sites no cas^s which interpret this

19

Court's cases as involving any kind of comparison of

20

interest test.

21

The focus in all

11 is very telling, I think,

Furthermore, in Abbate, Abbate versus United

22

States, this Court was presented with a similar interest

23

argument, and it rejected that argument.

24

petitioner's argument is in essence that the Court

25

simply didn't mean what it was saying in these cases.

I think the

Furthermore, if the Court -- if the idea of

2

interest and a comparison of interest had been the real

3

reason for deciding these cases. United States versus

4

Lanza would have been decided differently.

5

petitioner -- excuse me, the defendant was prosecuted in

possessing liquor.

8

indicted in Federal court for manufacturing, possessing,

9

and transporting exactly the same ligucr.

10

He pled guilty.

There, the

He was then

Sc therefore

the interests in this case were identical .

11

The second reason for rejecting this

12

comparison of interest test is a related cne.

13

this comparison of interest is contrary to the settled

14

law

15

area of prosecution by two different states without

16

casting serious doubts on its holdings in other areas.

17

Because

in this area, the Court could not adopt it in the

The third reason for rejecting this comparison

18

of interest test is a more practical one- If this te st

19

were adopted, the Court would be discarding a very < lear

20

and a very sound doctrine in favor of cne that has to be

fleshed out on a case by case basis.

Mow, if you want to simply boil

the case down to a matter of interest, and if you can

assume that the punishment or the proceedings in another

state can satisfy Alabama's interest under its law, then

Alabama does have an unsatisfied interest in this
