prejudicial to who?

The state had their

opportunity to present their evidence to convince that

Court that pecuniary gain did apply just as whoever the

trial lawyer was in state v. Park, which convinced that

court, and it came up in the Arizona Supreme Court did

10

find that pecuniary gain is not limited to the hired

11

gun.
QUESTIONS

12

But I am still not entirely clear

13

not entirely clear on your submission.

14

is that if there is insufficient evidence to support the

11

the Arizona Supreme Court in relying upon their decision

12

in Poland II and saying we do not agree, they refer to a

13

case called Knapp v. Carwell,

14

Knapp v. Carwell results from an earlier case which was

15

called State v. Watson, where the constitutionality cf

16

the Arizona death penalty that was involved here was

17

first brought to the attention of the Arizona Supreme

18

Court, and by judicial interpretation they found that

19

the statute wasn’t unconstitutional.

20

in regard to Lockett v.

21

and one thing they find is that double jeopardy doesn’t

22

apply in the Watson case, because its resentencing is

which is an unusual case.

This was an answer

decision to the Ninth Circuit, compare Arizona's

5

procedure to Missouri, and they find a hig distinction

6

at that point, because it involved a judge in Eullingtcn

-- I mean, excuse me — yes, the judge in Bullington and

8

vice versa.

9

in Arizona the judge does it.

They in that time, in makirg their

In Bullington the jury determines it, but
That was the distinction.

And in addition, they found that the

10
11

sentencing procedure is ameliorative, that these people

12

haven't started serving their death sentence, so double

13

jeopardy does net apply, and further, one case out of

14

that whole group presents an issue somewhat compatible

15

with the issue here, and that was Mr. Valencia.

QUESTIONS

General Grant, may I ask you if

there had not been a setting aside of the conviction and

5

the appeal was only on the death penalty, and they had

then done exactly what they did, under your view, as a

7

matter of Arizona law, I am curious, would the Arizona

8

Supreme Court have had the authority to affirm the death

penalty changing the rationale by saying that he made an

error of law on the pecuniary circumstance, aggravating

11

circumstance, even though the ether one was net

12

13

MR. GRANT*

My opinion is that the Arizona

14

Supreme Court does have

that power.

15

that power, however, the Arizona Supreme Court in other

16

cases has tended to exercise it carefully, and in that
