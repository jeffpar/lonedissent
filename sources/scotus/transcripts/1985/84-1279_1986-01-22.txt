6

The parties have taken the position that the

harmless error should be a determination at some point,

or at least outcome determinative prejudice should be a

without consideration of prejudice.

Fairbanks, that we have to approach the analysis some

there is a violation in t ha first place or whether you

MR. FAIRBANKS!

four Honor, this Court has

3

recognized that cross examination restriction cases raise

4

confrontation clause problems because restrictions on

5

cross examination emasculate the right.

6

QUESTION;

Mr. Fairbanks, throughout your brief

7

you have cited Chapman against California, and did not

8

the Court hold in that case that it doesn *t make any

9

difference whether it is a constitutional violation or

10

some other violation that the harmless error rule applies

11

to both categories?

12

MR. FAIRBANKS;

Your Honor, Chapman stands for

13

the proposition that at least for federal constitutional

14

violations there is not an automatic reversal rule

15

mandated in all cases, and that therefore some

16

consideration --

17

QUESTION;

Undoubtedly courts would look more

18

— give a much closer scrutiny to a constitutional

19

violation, wouldn't you think, than they would to some

20

other statutory or regulation —

21

22
23

MR. FAIRBANKS;

That is true, Your Honor, and

we are content —
QUESTION;

And therefore Justice O'Connor's

24

question, is it a constitutional violation or not?

25

really makes a difference as to whether you concede there

8

ought to start looking at it.

Justice White, I think our

position is that in the analysis the ravers al is not

What does the Supreme Court of

Delaware -- who do they represent?

MR. FAIRBANKS*

Your Honor,

the Supreme Court

18

of Delawire is the highest judicial body in the state.

19

It determines the law of the State of Delaware, and

20

reviews convictions and reverses when it determines that

either federal constitutional or state constitutional law

22

is violated.

I don't believe that that's the

The crux of this

It places the line on the basis of quality of

17

outcome would have changed had cross examination gone

19

We ask this Court simpJy to push the line differently, to

concerns so that tne determination of the importance of

concede — or what is your position on whether there can

12

In other words, do you think prejudice to the

accused is an alenent of the violation of the

confrontation clausa, or only an element of the harmless

error inquiry?

16

MR. FAIRBANKS*

Your Honor, tha guts of the

17

Delaware Supreme Court decision is that effective cross

18

examination was not permitted.

19

this case doesn’t mandate the determination, that at some

20

point, this right should ba looked at in concert with all

21

the other Sixth Amendment rights, effective assistance of

counsel, speedy trial, compulsory process.

We suggest that although

HR. FAIRBANKS*

QUESTION!

That is true.

So I am asking you, is there a

prejudiced component in the confrontation violation in

your view?
HR. FAIRBANKS*

Ne concede that if there is a

is that it does become a component, but this case need

If the outcome

trying to figure oat what you are saying, what issue that

conceded, it is directed to the harmless error inquiry.

I just don't know what your position is.

13

HR. FAIRBANKS*

This Court in Davis versus

14

Alaska reversed, and this is the basis upon which the

15

Delaware Supreme Court based its ruling, its

16

interpretation of Davis versus Alaska.

17

interpretation of Davis versus Alaska is excessively

18

literal, and it doesn't look to what this Court-

19

did in Davis versus Alaska.

20

We think that its

actually

Davis versis Alaska in our view ioes not compel

21

a per se rule because Davis versus Alaska considered two

22

things, one,

23

have been successful, and two, it determined that Green

was a crucial, in effect, the key witness for the

25

prosecution in that case.

whether the cross examination of Green could

3

analysis not because the Constitution forbad it,

4

simply it reflects tie common sense approach that if a

5

witness is key, if the state's case wouldn't be the same,

6

they couldn't even prove the case without Green's

7

testimony, a harmless error analysis is impossible.

but

So that, yes, if Davis versus — Davis versus

It did not consider a harmless error

Alaska, we think, can be read to pushing the analysis

10

into outcome determinative prejudice into the violation

However, for this case, we don't care where the

MR. FAIRBANKS:

Is it Delaware

The Delaware Supreme Court

10

determined that it was federal constitutional law, and we

11

think that is the error, that the Federal Constitution

12

does not mandate reversal without consideration of

wherever you play it.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL J. LARKIN, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES
AS AMICUS CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER
MR. LARKIN;

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it

please the Court, the question before the Court in this
\

14

case is essentially one of classification.

15

Court's questions have made clear, the question here

16

turns on prejudice, and ahether prejudice is an element

17

of the claim that a defendant must make in order to

18

establish a confrontation clause violation or whether it

19

is part of the harmless error analysis.

20

As the

Now, in our brief we haven't focused on that

21

precise question, because the question presented in the

22

petition didn't seam to do that and because the

23

allocation of the burden of proof in this case should not

24

be outcome determinative.

25

In Hastings the Court made clear that most

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 200C1

(202) 628-9300

1

constitutional errors can be harmless/ but Hastings like

2

Chapman, sail that there are certain categories of errors

3

that are not susceptible to that type of analysis.

4

first and most elementary category are those errors that

5

for one reason or another effectively deprive the

6

defendant of what has come to be known as a trial.

7

The

That follows directly from the due process

8

principle that a defendant cannot be punished at all by

9

the state or by the government until he has received a

10

trial that accords with basic fundamental fairness.
In a case where the defendant may have denied

11
12

all opportunity to cross examine any of the government's

13

witnesses, which was essentially what you had in

process, which is to enhance the accuracy of the

outcome.

be forced just

to say that — I would take tne same position we took in

to decile that question in this case because it wasn't

outcome determinative.

3

Sow, once the category of error is put to one

4

side,

5

deprived of a trial altogether, the question becomes

6

whether or not the type of error is one in which the

7

court will virtually presume in every case that the

8

defendant was prejudiced.

9

that is, the category where the defendant has been

Mr. Larkin, may I just take the

11

there must be an opportunity to show bias, one form of

MR. LARKIN:

So even though we agree that the

trial judge should not have cat off the inquiry in this

manner, since in this type of case there was no prejudice

to the defendant, there is no reason to foreclose that

11

type of inquiry based on the characterization that the

12

Delaware Supreme Court made.

13

What the Delaware Supreme Court essentially did

14

was say that since there was a strong case for showing

15

bias, and since there was a complete denial of anj

16

opportunity to do that, there is no reason to go further

17

and decide whether the case should be decided

differently, whether the outcome was affected.

2

QUESTIONi

3

HR. LARKIN*

Right.
But here the Delaware Supreme

4

Court believed that -- it had to presume that the

5

defendant was prejudiced in essence, and it relied on

6

Davis, and we don't think Davis can be real that way.

7

Davis painstakingly pointed out the fact that the

8

defendant there had been prejudiced in a variety of

9

different ways, in fact, pointed out that the witness may

10
11

have even lied on the stand.
There is iLso no reason to adopt the rule that

12

the Delaware Supreme Court did.

13

or not there is a complete denial of cross examination

14

and the question of whether or not the witness is crucial

are all elements in deciding whether or not the outcome

of the case -was affected.

No, perjury is important,

but even

1

under the Court’s decisions dealing with the introduction

2

of perjured testimony, that fact alone is insufficient to

3

call for reversal.

4

QUESTION*

My final question is, do you see any

5

unfairness in letting one side question the witness and

6

denying the other side the exact same privilege?

7

MR. LARKIN*

Oh, it is unfair, but the question

8

is not simply whether it is fair to allow the procedure

9

to go in this fashion.

10

QUESTION*

It is not too unfair.

11

MR. LARKIN*

If the effect of the trial has not

12

been changed in any substantial manner, there is no

13

reason to set the judgment aside.

14

defendant has been prejudiced by a restriction on cross

15

examination turns on a host of factors, the importance of

16

this witness to the case, the claim of bias and its

17

strength, the nature of the defense that the defendant

18

has raised, and a variety of aatt irs that will vary from

19

case to case.

QUESTIONI

I would Like to

understand exactly what your position is with respect to

6

whether or not in this case, at least, the Delaware

7

Supreme Court applied a per se rule.

8

9

I read from Page A7 of the opinion of the
Delaware Supreme Court, the first full paragraph;

"We

10

hold that under the circumstances of this case, where the

11

defendant was subjected to a blanket prohibition against

12

exploring potential bias through cross examination, the

13

trial court committed a per se error."

14

Is it your position that the error in this case

15

was a per se error, not subject at all to examination

16

with respect to whether prejudice was caused?

Yes.

QUESTION:

Are you saying that just to the law

of Delaware, or is that the federal constitutional rule?
HR. WILLIAMS*

Well, we have argued that in the

22

alternative.

We have initially asserted that this was

23

decided, this case was decided on the basis of state law,

24

that Delaware had a particular parochial problem.

25

is, this problem keeps occurring, occurring, and

In

fact. Van Arsdall also cites to Davis versus Alaska, but
the important thing, I think, about that, and the way it
should be interpreted as to the federal guestion issue
here is that Delaware says in the Van Arsdall opinion
that its decision, its rule is consistent, not identical,
but consistent with Davis.
In fact, the Delaware rule seems to have
