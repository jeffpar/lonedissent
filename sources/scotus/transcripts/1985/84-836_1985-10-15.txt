ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Mr. Prahl, I think you may

MR. PRAHL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
On June 27, 1962, the Kings County Grand Jury returned
a true bill indicting Respondent Booker T. Hillery on a charge

10

of first degree murder.

11

murdering a 15-year old girl on March 21, 1962.

12

Respondent Hillery was charged with

Jury selection for the guilt phase of Respondent's

13

trial began on October 23, 1962.

14

of first degree murder and in another phase of tie trial the

15

same jury voted unanimously to impose the death penalty.

16

Respondent was found guilty -

The guilt phase of Respondent's initial trial was

17

affirmed while the penalty trial was reversed b} the California

18

Supreme Court.

19

20

QUESTION:

Did I understand you to say this crime

occurred in 1962?

21

MR. PRAHL:

22

The crime occurred in March.

Yes, Your Honor.
The indictment was

23

returned in June.

trials after his first penalty trial was reversed.

Mr. Hillery received two subsequent penalty

Mr. Hillery deserved nothing less than death for the brutal

4

murder of Marlene Miller.

5

In both cases, the juries voted unanimously to again
In all, 36 jurors have decided that

Twenty-one years after the initial jury verdict,

6

Respondent's conviction was reversed by the United States

7

District Court for the Eastern District of California.

8
9

Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court
found that there had been purposeful discrimination against

10

black persons in selecting the grand jury between 1956 and

11

1962.

12

QUESTION:

Mr. Prahl, did the state plead as a defense

13

to the federal habeas action that it was prejudiced in present­

14

ing its defense of the action by the passage of time?

15

MR. PRAHL:

No, Your Honor.

In the original return

16

we did not plead delay as a defense.

17

of a motion when it became clear that we were going beyond

18

the original trial court record.

19

20

QUESTION:

MR. PRAHL:

25

Yes, Your Honor.

The District Court

denied our motion to dismiss in a published opinion.

23
24

And, the District Court ruled on that

defense?

21

22

It was raised by way

QUESTION:

And, you have not presented that issue

here?
Mr. PRAHL:

No, Your Honor.

We feel that that is

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

one of the issues that becomes involved in the question of

2

harmless error.

3

this Court is a question of whether purposeful discrimination

4

in the selection of a grand jury can be considered harmless

5

error.

6

In other words, as you -- The issue before

And, one of the factors that we think the Court can

7

look to in making that decision is the passage of time, the

8

changes in circumstances that have occurred.

9

Here, again, there was 21 years from the time of

10

the initial jury verdict until the time when the District Court

11

finally issued its opinion.

12

Again, the Ninth Circuit --

13

QUESTION:

14
15
16
17

How many years does it take to become

harmless?
MR. PRAHL:

Your Honor, I don't think the passage

of time alone is the sole criterion.
QUESTION:

You were asl ed why did you drop the time

18

point and you said you dropped it because of the harmless error.

19

Now, I want to know why does time become a harmless error and

20

my particular question is how many years do you have to have

21

before you get harmless error?

22

MR. PRAHL:

Your Honor, in this particular case,

23

the passage of time has indicated that there is no continuing

?4

history of discrimination in the county.

25

after Mr. Hillery was indicted, a black person appe^ed on

In fact, the year

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

the county grand jury.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. PRAHL:

Would that have helped him?
Well, Your Honor, we don't think that

4

it is necessarily the case in this type of situation; that

5

the remedy provides specific relief to the Defendant.

6

these kinds of cases are looking for is an overall deterrence

7

effect on the criminal justice administration system and we

8

believe that where, for example, the record indicates that

9

there is no continuing history of discrimination, and, in fact,

10

in this particular record, Your Honor, I think it is important

11

to note that when the trial judge made his remarks, he indicated

12

that efforts had begun even before this particular challenge

13

had been made to locate black persons who could serve on the

14

county grand jury.

15

What

So, the District Court's finding that this particular

16

motion precipitated a change may not be entirely supported

17

by the record.

18

at the time of the evidentiary hearing in the federal court,

19

the trial judge, Judge Wingrove, indicated on the record at

20

the time of Mr. Hillery's motion to quash, that he was making

21

efforts to try to find black people that could serve on the

22

county grand jury before the motion was brought.

In fact here the trial judge, who was dead

23

So, we think —

MR. PRAHL:

2

QUESTION:

MR. PRAHL:

4

1962, that is correct, Your Honor.
They were looking for "black" jurors?
The trial judge indicate, Your Honor,

that he was looking for —

QUESTION:

6

MR. PRAHL:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. PRAHL:

9

QUESTION:

Did he use the word "black?"
Pardon me, Your Honor.
Did he use the word "black?"
I don't believe he did, Your Honor.
Because nobody else did back in the 60's.

10

MR. PRAHL:

11

What the trial judge indicated was that he was looking

No, Your Honor.

12

for a representative cross section of the community to serve

13

on the Kings County Grand Jury.

14

He was especially concerned about the ability of

15

the jurors to serve in California's grand jury system which

16

plays a watch-dog role over county government.

17

the operations of the fiscal aspects of county government.

18

In other words, it is not something that would come easily

19

to every citizen

20

They oversee

in the community.

But, if you look at the record as a whole, especially

21

the transcript of the trial judge's remarks, it becomes very

22

clear that the trial judge considered black people to be

23

qualified and capable of serving.

24
25

So, I think those factors, the factor of the continued
history or the history

the county is one thing the Court

can look to in determining whether or not this form of con­

2

stitutional error requires reversal.

Harmless error has been held —

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Attorney General, before you move

5

away from the question of delay, is there any evidence in the

record as to whether or not California can retry the Respondent

MR. PRAHL:

Your Honor, we tried to argue harmless

QUESTION:

Within a certain period.

QUESTION:

So, the question I ask you is is there

16

any evidence in the record as to whether or not the State of

17

California, after quarter of a century, can retry this

18

particular Respondent?

19

judge is dead.

20

MR. PRAHL:

The witnesses are all dead, the trial

We did not introduce any of that evidence,

21

Your Honor.

22

why is because we — that would have been one of the factors

23

that we would have desired to present evidence to the District

words, harmless error in this particular kind of case —

There is no evidence in the record.

The reason

In other

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

One of the rationales for deciding that harmless error should

2

not be applied has been this notion that somehow you can retry

3

a defendant.

that in Morris v. Slappy, in —

MR. PRAHL:

We would be forced in that

One of the problems I would like the Court to take

9
10

into account in terms of the harmless error rule is a passage

11

from the case of Morris v. Slappy where the Court recognized

12

for cne of the first instances the right of the victims in

13

these particular matters.
Now, this is a murd ;r case, but the Court should

be sensitive to the concerns of the parents here.

of this particular young girl have had to endure three separate

17

trials and they have been able to put this horrendous experience

behind them.

19

take this family through this agony once again, where time

20

has had the opportunity to heal this wound, we feel that that

is something the Court should take into account in its

harmless error calculation.

QUESTION:

How really does that bear on harmless

error?

2

MR. PRAHL:

3

QUESTION:

4

Well, Your Honor, we think —
It seems to rre your are sweeping every­

thing under the rug of harmless error.

5

MR. PRAHL:

No, Your Honor.

The Court is the one —

6

Again, in Morris v. Slappy that brought this — It is part

7

of the question of a retrial.

8

the public's confidence in a jury verdict and in the finality

9

of that jury verdict.

10

11

QUESTION:

It is part of the question of

That is hardly harmless error.

It might

be something else.

12

MR. PRAHL:

I think that is part, Your Honor, of the

13

rationale behind the extension of harmless error to even

14

constitutional errors.

15

in the finality of a jury verdict and the finality in the integrity

16

of the jury process —

17

QUESTION:

In other words, the public's confidence

With the passage of time, at what point
I

18

does error become harmless?

19

20
21

MR. PRAHL:
on time.

I don't think error depends necessarily

Time is a factor.

It is not the crucial factor.

In this particular case, Your Honor, I think there

22

are other factors that are much more telling on the necessity

23

for imposing the harmless error standard.

24
25

First of all, in this case, black people were serving
on trial juries on a regular basis.

The record is replete

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

with that.

2

Honor, by Mr. Hillery's trial counsel, the attorney that

3

represented him at trial, the attorney who made the motion

4

to quash, that had this case been brought to a preliminary

5

hearing, there is absolutely no doubt in his mind that Mr.

6

Hillery would have been bound over for trial.

7

There is an acknowledgement in this case, Your

That fact, the fact that there is nothing to remedy —

8

The purpose of the grand jury as noted in the dissent in Rose

9

and in Justice Jackson's dissent in Cassell, the purpose of

10

the grand jury is to provide probable cause to determine whether

11

a trial is to be conducted.

12

And, here, even Mr. Hillery's trial attorney has

13

acknowledge that there is overwhelming evidence to support

14

probable cause .

15

In fact, the California Supreme Court in commenting

16

on the evidence in this particular case, the evidence of guilt,

17

characterized this case as being overwhelming.

18

The fact that Mr. Hillery received a full and fair

19

trial in front of a jury, the fact that he received three trials —

20

I grant the Court that the second two trials were penalty trials,

21

but a jury deciding whether to impose the death penalty must

22

first obviously be convinced of the Defendant's guilt before

23

they would consider imposing such a harsh penalty.

24
25

You have three separate trials.

All of those

unanimous findings beyond a reasonable doubt.
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

Again, the point we made before that jury discrimi­
nation was being looked to already by the superior court judge.

3

There really is no basis for imposing the kind of

4

relief or deterrence that is addressed in many of the cases,

5

because here the mechanism of change was already in place and

6

there is nothing in the record before this Court which suggests

7

that there is a continuing pattern or a continuing history

8

of discrimination.

9

We think that in these kinds of cases application

10

of the harmless error rule would continue to serve the signifi­

11

cant deterrent interest which the Court has espoused on many

12

occasions.

13

Petitioner would be required to make a prima facie case of

14

discrimination.

15

case has been made to rebut it, then the trial court would

16

make its finding.

17

In other words, the process would remain the same.

The state would have the opportunity if that

There would still be a finding of whether or not

18

there has been purposeful discrimination.

19

and of itself is a significant undertaking for the judiciary.

20

In other words, that finding provides the integrity that is

21

needed in these kinds of cases and insures the operation of

22

the criminal justice system.

23

QUESTION:

That finding in

I have a little trouble following that

24

argument.

25

of the trial shows that there was plenty of probable cause,

As I understand, your main point is that the proof

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

and, therefore, the indictment — the fact that there might

2

have been discrimination in picking the grand jury is really

3

harmless as to this Defendant.

4

Why — If you follow that reasoning, why would one

5

ever want to litigate the issue?

6

raise the question, just for future people to have a declaration

7

on the record of some kind?

8
9

MR. PRAHL:

Why would the Defendant ever

I just don't know.

Well, Your Honor, to clarify the point,

our position is not that the proof of the trial shows there

10

is probable cause.

11

Mr. Hillery's original trial attorney, Mr. Goodwin, Hugh Goodwin,

12

testified at the federal evidentiary hearing -- He was asked

13

was there any doubt in your mind if the motion to quash had

14

been successful and Mr. Hillery had been brought before a

15

preliminary hearing whether he would have been bound over for

16

trial and Mr. Goodwin acknowledged that there was no question

17

that the evidence before the grand jury was sufficient to

18

indict.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

Our point in this particular case is that

Wouldn't that always be true if you later

have a trial and find them guilty beyond a reasonable doubt?
MR. PRAHL:

That is certainly true, Your Honor.

22

Well, it may or may not be true.

23

witnesses that have testified at a — a crucial witness may

24

become unavailable and the state's case may be less convincing,

25

as it were, than ?t a preliminary hearing.

Witnesses may become unavailable

I grant you that

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

that is a rare occurrence, but that is possible.
The important point in this case was that not only

3

was the evidence at the indictment sufficient to show probable

4

cause, but also the evidence at three separate trials

5

established Respondent's guilt beyond any question.

6

the California Supreme Court noted — The California Supreme

7

Court characterized the evidence as overwhelming.

8
9

QUESTION:

But, all of these cases are cases in which

a defendant has been convicted and there has been proof beyond

10

a reasonable doubt.

11

it three times instead of once makes much difference.

12

And, as

MR. PRAHL:

I don't know that the fact they proved

Well, the question, Your Honor, as to

13

why would a defendant bother to do this?

14

that all cases be judged harmless errcr, but the Court established

15

an across-the-board rule.

We are not arguing

16

What we are arguing is that harmless error be an

17

option, be something that the trial court has available to

18

it to consider under certain well defined circumstances and,

19

if harmless error is shown to be true, then there would be

20

no basis for quashing the indictment.

21

However, if the Defendant can point to actual prejudice,

22

for example, if there is a continuing history of discrimination,

23

if you combine discrimination in the selection of a grand jury

24

with the discrimination of trial juries, so that there is a

25

fundamental unfairness in the trial process, it may be that
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2
3

it would be inappropriate to apply the harmless error rule.
QUESTION:

Wouldn't we have to overrule Rose against

Mitchell to agree with you?

4

MR. PRAHL:

I don't agree with that, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION:

Well, you certainly seem to claim that

6

it has been eroded.

7

MR. PRAHL:

Well, Rose — No one is quite sure exactly

8

what Rose — what the holding of the Rose case is given the

9

line-up, if you will, of the justices in that case.

10

But, if

the Court —

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. PRAHL:

What do you mean by that?
Well, with the justices votiny for

13

different parts of the opinion, it is not — At least one circuit

14

judge has analyzed the case as saying that there is no clear

15

majority behind the rule that harmless error does not apply.

16

But, the point we wish to make, Your Honor —

17

QUESTION:

You don't think Rose against Mitchell

18

really leads on the question of whether harmless error applies

19

to discrimination in the grand juries?

20

MR. PRAHL:

I am not sure that there is a majority

21

of the Court that supports.

22

But, I don't think that is crucial to the outcome of this case,

23

because I don't think Rose necessarily involves the same facts

24

and if the Court is of the opinion thab Rcsc is precedent in

25

this situation, we are asking the Court to overturn that.

We have briefed that question.

f

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

We are asking the Court here to carve out an exception for

2

those situations where — that would allow the trial court

3

to make a harmless error determination.

4

Again, in this particular case, we would like to

5

point out that there is no claim of actual prejudice resulting

6

from the grand jury indictment.

7

The sole claim in this case, and it is a significant

8

one — I don't mean to diminish the claim — but the sole claim

9

here is that there was purposeful exclusion of blacks from

10
11

1956 to 1962.
Our point here is that absent a showing of some

12

prejudice in a grand jury process where black people regularly

13

served on the trial juries, harmless error would be appropriate.

14

Harmless error, as I have tried to point out, serves

15

several important functions.

16

that the essential purpose of the criminal law is to decide

17

factual questions reg irding the Defendant's guilt and not

18

technical questions regarding the composition of a pre-trial

19

hearing body.

20

It gives effect to the principle

Again, in this particular case, where you have three

21

separate juries voting unanimously regarding the Respondent's

22

guilt, you are seriously eroding the public's respect for the

23

criminal justice process.

24

difficulty understanding why what would amount to close to

25

23 years now, lc.ter we are reversing a c^'minal conviction

The public does not and has

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that is supported by overwhelming evidence where the trial

2

was fair, where black people participated in the trial juries,

3

simply because blacks were excluded from the grand jury process.

4

In the absence of anything that would indicate that

5

Mr. Hillery did not receive a full and fair trial, the law,

6

as we see it, should permit the trial judge to engage in a

7

harmless error analysis.

8
9

Finally, again, we would like to point to significant
changes in the area of deterrence which we feel are now in

10

place that were not necessarily in place when this Court consider

11

such cases as Cassell v. Texas and Reece and some of the other

12

grand jury cases.

13

In the current situation, there is a great deal more _

14

public attention focused on such types of claims.

15

for example, would surely bring a claim like this in a

16

judicial finding of discrimination to the public's attention.

17

The media,

There are civil and criminal sanctions for

18

discrimination.

19

that are concerned and are ready to perform a deterrent function.

20

All of these suggest that deterrence by the courts by way of

21

reversing a criminal conviction are no longer necessary or

22

essential; that the courts can rely on some of these other

23

deterrent mechanisms that are now in place and are now willing

24

to function in order to prevent a reoccurrence of any form

25

of discrimination.

There are also public and private agencies

The second issue that is before the Court is the

2

question of whether or not there was a significant change in

3

the evidentiary basis of Mr. Hillery's claim when it finally

4

reached the federal court.

5

We have included in the Joint Appendix the elaborate

6

computer model that was set up to process information and spit

7

out a result that told the District Court supposedly the level

8

of discrimination that was occurring and the possibility that

9

this could have occurred by chance.

10

Here, there was actual testimony offered from citizens

11

of Kings County that was never offered in the trial court.

The trial court's remarks contained in the transcript are

13

indicative^that the trial court felt that Mr. Goodwin had simply

Twenty years later all of these failings, these short­

19

comings, were remedied and were placed before the Federal District

Court.

21

The Ninth Circuit, in a split decision, did affirm

22

the District Court's order, but the dissenting judge there

23

did find that there had been a significant change in the

24

character of that particular claim.

this case represents to me, the Wright flyer on the one hand

particular case involved.

wholly been transformed in the words of Daniels v. Nelson or

MR. PRAHL:

2

No, I don't believe it is.

The issue

3

has never been raised in California.

4

issue, as it was presented to the District Court, should have

5

first been brought to California so California would have had

6

a chance.

7

But, we do feel the

California reviewed it under the same meager record

8

that was presented to the trial court and there is nothing

9

at all to indicate that the California court had all this

10

bundle of new evidence —

that was made?

MR. PRAHL:

19

You had a chance to meet any submission

Yes, Your Honor, we did.
Right.
We chose to defend the matter based on

the state record, because we felt that was what was proper.

QUESTION:

Mr. Prahl, if it were sent back as

21

unexhausted to the state court, would the state court enter­

22

tain a rehearing on that, do you know?

MR. PRAHL:

QUESTION:

25

On the new evidence, Your Honor?
Yes, and in California law would that

be open?
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. PRAHL:

1

Yes.

Under California's habeas corpus

2

law, Petitioner would be allowed to make a case for pre§enting.

3

He would have a problem though, Your Honor, as to showihg why

4

he had not presented that evidence in the first instance; in

5

other words, whether the computer model is such that it would

6

have been unavailable.
But, the testimony, for example, of the citizens

7

8

of the county, the black citizens who testified as to their

9

recollection of the grand jury process, if they were available

10

and 'they simply chose not to present them in the state forum

11

the first time, there would be some doubt as to whether they

12

could present them a second time.
And, that is one of the problems again with the federal

13
14

judge's notion of the plenary power of a federal evidentiary

15

hearing.

MR. TEDMON:

2

the Court:
Hillery filed his first petition in Federal Court

3

in 1978, filed in the Northern District of California, the

4

wrong forum.

5

to the Eastern District of California where Chief Judge Thomas

6

J. MacBride was assigned the case.

7

It was a per se petition and it was transferred

Judge MacBride, in reviewing Hillery's petition,

8

decided that Hillery had set forth a prima facie case of

9

discrimination in the selection of the grand jury which had

10
11

handed down the indictment against him in 1962.
He formed that opinion fundamentally based on Hillery's

12

allegations that in the history of Kings County, California,

13

which was formed in 1893, until 1962, there had never been

14

a black per ;on on a grand jury in that county.

15

QUESTION:

Would you be here if there had been, maybe

16

not in this’ grand jury, but in a previous one?

17

have solved the problem as far as your client is concerned

18

if at some time in the history of the court there had been

19

a black member of the grand jury?

20

MR. TEDMON:

Would that

I think if there had been some evidence

21

that in the history of the county there had been a black or

22

blacks on the grand jury, I think Hillery would not have a

23

position here today.

24
25

I think that would be part of his problem.

There are many ways you can look at the problem,
because if you got down to th^ individual grand jury that
23
a

nirpc;oiM Qic-ionwiniivir; miM'SANiv iMir

1

indicted him and he could show some clear discrimination there,

2

he might have an argument.
But, the argument basically, as Judge MacBridge saw

3
4

it, was that in the history of the county there had never been

5

a black on a grand jury and that, in his mind, lead him to

6

say — As far as he was concerned, that was evidence which

7

established a prima facie case of discrimination.

8
9

Now, when he took senior status, the case was assigned
to Judge

Karlton

who had just been appointed chief judge

10

of the district.

11

a problem, because he had the California Supreme Court's decision

12

that Hillery had not established a case of discrimination in

13

the grand jury that indicted him.

14

When Judge

Karlton took the case he had

He had Chief Judge MacBride' s opinion th.it a prima

15

facie case had been established.

16

pelled to apply the presumption of correctness doctrine

17

to the California factfinding, although he didn't have to do

18

it to the legal conclusion, but at the same token, he had Judge

19

MacBride's law of the case before him.

20

to do with these two conflicting opinions.

3

What Judge Karlton did was examine Judge MacBride's

order, because the state had already responded.

5

had indicated Hillery had exhausted his state remedy.

6

argued that the rich had not lied because a full and fair hearing

7

had been held in the state court.

8

that perhaps Judge MacBride's opinion was a little premature

9

for the reason that the mere exclusion of blacks from a grand

jury did not necessarily mean discrimination.

11

there should be some other data in support of that which would

12

tell him whether or not there had been some discrimination

13

in the grand jury process in Kings County, California.

n

He believed

Furthermore, the state record had not been lodged

15

with the District Court until after the court had issued its

16

order.

17

18

So, in that regard, he determined to set aside that

portion of the order which said it was a prima facie case.
He was concerned that perhaps Hillery had not had

19

a full and fair hearing in state court, because when he examined

20

the Supreme Court's decision, it basically relied on what Judge

21

Wingrove had said in terms of the fact that he did not

discriminate.

MR. TEDMON:

Your Honor, in the record of the hearing

at the motion to quash — It is a difficult record.

19

was a lot of what appeared to me frankly to be hostile dialogue

20

between Judge Wingrove and Hugh Goodwin.

MR. TEDMON:

Yes, he would have to make that allegation.

QUESTION:

13

And, if a defendant then does not present

14

evidence at the state court level that is crucial and sub­

15

stantial, can the defendant then simply wait until going tc

16

federal court later and present that evidence in your view?

17

Is there never a proper application of inexcusable neglect,

for instance, that would preclude the defendant from later

presenting that for a second crack at it at the federal habeas

level?

MR. TEDMON:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY INC.

QUESTION:

And, I think the rule does extend — Courts

2

have said on occasion that even though the claim is the same,

3

if the evidence adduced in support of it is totally different,

4

then the claim may be unexhausted.

5

MR. TEDMON:

Yes, that is the way the courts rule.

6

In this particular case, the claim remains the same.

7

think anybody argues that point.

8
9

I don't

The claim remains the same.

The only thing that happened in the District Court
which was different from the Superior Court was that there

10

was an analysis done of the data that was really before both

11

of the courts.

12

in Kings County, it wasn't done by the prosecutor in Kings

13

County, it wasn't done by Mr. Goodwin in Kings County.

14

Now, that analysis was not done by the court

It just appeared to Judge Karlton that what he should

15

do is apply some sort of analytical tool to the data to give

16

him a little more information in terms of analyzing the data.

17

QUESTION:

So, if he had been a computer expert himself

18

and in the course of deciding the case had gone back to his

19

office and run his own analysis of the facts that were before

20

him in the record, that would really be no different than what

21

happened here?

22

MR. TEDMON:

Yes.

As a matter of fact, Judge Karlton

23

did something similar to that.

24

reflects that he did a card analysis with an eight of diamonus

3

weak case for Mr. Hillery, a standard deviation of 3.03.

4

However, relating to the total lack of blacks on the grand

5

jury and the computerized analysis, he determined that those

6

things fit togethers.

7

and he also sat down on his own and did a standard

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tedmon, I thought there was

8

also some rather significant additional witness testimony over

9

and above the probability analysis.

10

Yes.

Isn't that so?

There were three witnesses who

and Rev. Folsom.

14

1

Now, that testimony was essentially all before the

2

Superior Court, because the Sheriff of Kings County testifying

that they had never known a black to on a grand jury in the

5

history of Kings County, which is what the elderly black people

testified to.

community.

8
9

They testified that there were blacks in the

Now, with respect to whether there were eligible
blacks or not, none of the witnesses testified to that in the

10

Superior Court hearing.

11

He indicated, yes, I had considered Lloyd Welcher.

12

Bessie Welcher's husband and Bessie gave a deposition in this

13

case.

14

but then I decided it would interfere with his employment,

15

so I chose not to place him on the grand jury, which must

16

indicate that the court in Kings County was aware that there

17

were eligible blacks, and if there is one eligible black, reason

18

and common sense would suggest there is more than one.

19

But, Judge Wingrove discussed it.
That is

Yes, I did talk to Lloyd Welcher and I considered him,

So, I don't think the testimony of the elderly black

20

people really altered anything that was before the California

21

Superior Court.

22

In any event, Judge Karlton, in analyzing all of the

23

data that was presented, arrived at the conclusion that Hillery

24

had established a prima facie case of discrimination and that

25

that pri^a facie case was unrefuted by the state.

1

Now, during the hearing itself the testimony from

2

the actuary was taken and he explained his analysis and an

3

interesting part of the problem that comes out of that hearing

4

is that Judge Karlton asked the computer expert would you

5

please do a probability calculation only for the years 1956

6

to 1962, the years during which Judge Wingrove was the only

7

sitting judge in Kings County, California.

8

people who would be candidates for the grand jury.

After the

9

review, he hand-picked the grand jurors themselves.

So, he

He selected the

10

was Kings County, California, as far as the grand jury was

11

concerned.

12

He was the policy-making agent.
What he did with his pocket calculator was sat down and

13

said, yes, I can do this calculation.

14

in that calculation he said chere would only be a probability

15

of two chances out of a thousand in that seven-year period

16

you could have had all non-black grand juries.

17

He worked it out and

Now, in Judge Kar iton's opinion, he restricted his

18

thinking to those seven years and I think that is very critical

19

to the analysis of whether he really went that far out of the

20

state court record.

25

You can't stop a trial judge

I don't know how you would do that.

As I view the state's position, what they are saying
is that Judge Karlton would not sit there and listen to the
33

testimony.

What he would do was sit there and say, am I going

8

year period and I think that is very appropriate and very com­

9

pelling in terms of how he handled the case.

10

What he did was restrict his thinking to that seven-

He further, in analyzing the rules that apply to

11

2254 motion, made some conclusions which are all in the record

12

to the effect that if summary dismissal was not — If he couldn't

13

do that at the outset, then the hearing would be mandated,

14

but there was this intermediate stage when he could expand

15

the record, which is what he did.

16

He then after that determined that even if something

17

began to come out during the hearing which would significantly

18

alter the posture of the case, he should still have the right

19

to continue on, complete the hearing in judicial economy terms,

20

finalize the case, finish the thing out.

21

So, what he did in any event was make his decision

22

that a prima facie case had been established and it was rebutted

23

in the record.

24
25

He issued his order that the writ should issue.

This went up on appeal in tne Ninth Circuit, upheld

It may be

this systematic exclusion of blacks from that grand jury process,

which is now the case, that we should determine there was what

That is the issue.

Your Honor, an error

of this magnitude, wherein an entire grand jury proceeding

Do you think Rose against Mitchell stands for that?
MR. TEDMON:

I don't think it says that.

it suggests it very strongly, because Rose versus Mitchell

I would think that is a very fundamental

So, the rationale that you rely on is

the integrity of the judicial process has never been uniformly

applied by this Court.

12

MR. TEDMON:

I missed that again.

I will ask you one other question while

you are thinking.

Who is concerned with the integrity of the

judicial process?

Lawyers, of course, are, and judges, of

22

course, are.

Do you the think the public is?

23

MR. TEDMON:

24

QUESTION:

25

I think so.
What do you think the public will think

of the courts in this case after 23 years, in view of the
42

fact this man has been unquestionably found guilty of a brutal

murder, and you are here arguing today that because of integrity

of the judicial process we should let him off?

MR. TEDMON:

I don't know that he would be let off.
That is your argument.

But, you would

The public, of course, is interested in

MR. TEDMON:

MR. TEDMON:

No.
Why should the harmless error not apply?
Because you would have a right for which

23

there would be no remedy if the harmless error rule applied.

24

It would not be, as I view it — There wouldn't be much of

a constitutional right if no remedy could attach for the
