In April 1978, the Southwestern P ewer

interested parties about the proposed rate increase and

After considering the public comments, the

SWPA reduced the rate increase to 33 percent and

submitted it to the Assistant Secretary of Energy for

his approval.

public comments and observed that this was the first

rate increase in the SWPA’s general rates in over 20

11

years.

12

The Assistant Secretary reviewed the

the applicable statutory standard because it would

generate revenues that would egual but not exceed the

SWPA's costs of generating the power.

So it is

10

especially peculiar that in this context, where the

11

rates already have been evaluated, even before they go

12

into effect on an interim basis, the courts below found

13

that the Secretary doesn’t have this interim

rate-setting authority.

17

MR. PINCUSi

Yes, Your Honor# and that long

18

delay is the problem that the Secretary faces

19

to recoup the cost of electricity for that what

20

Respondents — the result that for which Respondents

21

contend would have deprived the government of the

22

incremental revenue for that entire 33 month period and

23

essentially given them a windfall of paying rates that

24

had already been determined to be below cost for that

entire period of time.

QUESTION;

9

MR. PINCUS;

To what?
— since these early days.
How much have they cut it back?
I don't have the specific amount

10

of time, but I gather that it no longer takes

11

approximately three years to place rates into effect,

12

but the delay still cm be substantial, and there's no

13

reason why interim rates can* t be placed in effect since

14

Respondents essentially suffer no harm because if the

15

rate is subsequently found to be too high, they are

16

entitled to a refund.

reason for the Secretary to be deprived of that

authority here.

Since interim rates are such a

Hell, that's true, Your Honor,

8

but what the additional review does is impose safeguards

for taxpayers* rights to revenues that recoup costs land

10

also safeguards respondents' rights by giving them an

11

additional review to ensure that rates aren't too high.

12

So we don't — there's no prejudice to anyone here.

QUESTIONS

And here the FERC raised the rates,

didn't it?

15

MR. PINCUSi

The FERC

it first thought that

16

the Assistant Secretary was wrong and

17

were too low, and it subsequently was convinced, upon

18

getting some more information, that the rates were

19

appropriate.

QUESTIONS

The — do you contend that the

8

language of the contract goes no further than the

language of the statute itself?

10

Exactly, Your Honor.

We think

11

that the contract provisions simply say that the

12

Secretary may exercise

13

ratemaking authority.

14

QUESTIONS

the full extent of his statutory

Because the language is a bit

15

different.

The statute says the rate schedules to

16

become effective upon confirmation and approval by the

17

Federal Power Commission.
Now, do you interpret the statute after the

18
19

new creation of the Department of Energy as substituting

20

the Secretary of Energy for the Federal Power

21

Commission, or do you conceive that FEBC stands in the

22

shoes of the Federal Power Commission under that

language?

The Act specifically designates certain

10

provides that all the rest of the Federal Power

11

Commission's authority shall be transferred to the

12

Secretary, and since this authority under Section 5 of

13

the Flood Control Act is not specifically set forth in

14

the Department of Energy Organization Act as one of

15

those bits of authority that is transferred to the FERC,

16

it clearly is transferred to the Secretary of Energy by

17

that statute, and that is set out in our brief and also

18

in the Fifth Circuit's opinion in tne Tex-La case, and

19

we think the Court of Claims simply made a mistake in

20

reading the statute to transfer that authority to the

FERC.

(202) 628-9300

1

the Secretary has the statutory authority to impose

2

interim rates.

3

The second ground r-xied upon by the Court of

4

Claims is its view that Congress did not transfer the

5

Federal Power Commission's authority to the FERC.

6

However, as the Fifth Circuit pointed out and as we

7

demonstrate in our briefs, it's quite clear that the

8

Department of Energy Organization Act expressly

9

transfers that authority to the Secretary of Energy, and

10

that the FERC's involvement in this process is solely by

11

virtue of the fact that the Secretary determined that

12

review by the FERC was appropriate in his delegation

13

order.

14

So the only issue really in this case is

15

whether the Secretary has the authority to place cates

16

into effect on an interim basis, and we think that that

17

authority is supported on twg

18

of all, on 1 he basis of Secticj 5 of the Flood Control

19

Act which broadly empowered the Secretary of the

20

Interior to sell electricity at the lowest possible

21

rates to consumers, consistent with sound business

22

principles, and in using such a general term to describe

23

the scope of the Secretary's authority, Congress plainly

24

intended to give the Secretarv substantial leeway in

25

selecting the manner in which to administer this-

program

2

Basically Congress — this is a proprietary

3

program selling Federal property, and Congress has

4

directed the Secretary to dispose of it in whatever

5

manner he thought appropriate consistent with the way a

6

business would dispose of a similar asset.

7

Respondents have presented no reason that interim rate

8

increases should be excluded from this broad grant of

9

authority.

And

And in fact, interim rate increases are a

10

typical conventional ratemaking procedure, and rate

11

regulation schemes governing private utilities typically

12

provide that rates may be placed into effect on an

13

interim basis pending the final regulatory

14

determination.

15

And the reason for that rule is very simple.

16

The judgment has been made that the regulated

should not be required to bear the burden of

a refund if the lower rate is adopted by the FEPC.

think it would be anomalous to construe Section 5 in a

manner that deprived the Federal Government of this

QUESTIONS

We

Hr. Pincus, what evidence is there

7

that under the old scheme, before there was a Department

8

of Energy, that the Federal Power Authority interpreted

9

the Act as giving it the power to set interim rates?

10

MR. PINCUS;

Your Honor, there are three

11

examples, three cases in which the Federal Power

12

Commission did set rates into effect on an interim

13

basis, one example under this statute, one example under

14

the vary similar language of the statutes governing the

15

Bonneville power projects.

16

interpretations of the statute by the administrative

17

entity that administered it are entitled to deference

18

and show that the position for which we contend is the

19

appropriate interpretation of the statute.

I think that those

20

And Respondents make much of the fact that

21

those are the only examples, but this Court has held

22

several time that tha mere fact that an agency has not

23

exercised its power does not mean that the power doesn't

24

exist, and we think that is 311 that is true of the

25

situation cited by Respondents here.

I would also like to briefly address our

second argument, that independent of Section 5 of

DEAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES F. WHEATLEY, JF., ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS
MR. WHEATLEY*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Courts
In view of the argument that the government

1E

has made, we think there are three main issues that are

16

before this Court relating to the question of

17

not the Department of Energy could impose an interim

1 i

rate structure on the rates.

i9

whether or not the contacts the government entered with

20

these three cities, by their terms, do not allow an

21

interim rate but require the final rate, approved by the

22

Federgl Energy Regulatory Commission.

HR. WHEATLEY;

provisions have independent significance apart from the

2

statute, or does the contract permit what the statute

3

permits?

4

MR. WHEATLEY;

Justice O'Connor, I believe

5

that the contracts have independent validity because

6

when you real the language of

7

more explicit and more definitive than in fact the

8

language of the statate.

10

QUESTION;

those contracts, they are

Well, as I read the contract,

it

would even allow a retroactive increase.

11

MR. WHEATLEY;

12

QUESTION;

Well, the language of the --

So the language of the contract, if

13

that's what you are relying on, may be more generous

14

than the government even urges.

15

MR. WHEATLEY;

Well, I don't see how the

16

language of the contract could reach a retroactive

17

result because it says the new rates shall thereupon

18

become effective in accordance with and on the

19

effective —

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. WHEATLEY;

22
23

On the effective date specified.
— date specified in the

order.
Now,

it says "thereupon."

In other words, the

24

FERC and its predessor, the Federal Power Commission,

25

would have to confirm and approve the increase, and they

(202) 628-9300

I

1

cannot approve the increase and confirm it until they dc

2

that in a final order.

3

How,

the words "approve" have bean interpreted

4

a number of times by the Federal Power Commission itself

5

in a number of cases,

6

Power Commission has said that the word "approved,"

7

where contract language requires approval' by the FPC,

8

that refers to the final approval process, so that you

9

need — the Commission would have to be making its final

10
11

and in those cases the Federal

approval.
A case directly in point on that is New York

12

State Electric £ Gas v.

13

The FPC -- neither the FPC nor the FERC nor anyone

14

involved in these rates since they have been in effect

15

have ever sought to put them into effect on a

16

retroactive basis, and I think it comes from the

17

language in the contract and also from the language of

18

tile Flood Control Act which says that the rate increases

19

cannot be put into effect until a confirmation and

20

approval, which by the legislative history of the

21

statute means final approval.

22

FERC at 712 F.2d 762 or 768.

So the Commission could not after final

23

approval attempt to oarkdate the contract.

That issue

24

Kasn’t come up, but the language certainly is clear

25

regardless of the question of retroactivity, that the

3

QUESTION;

Bat you take the position that in

4

any event, it wouldn't be allowed under the statute

5

either, is that right?

6

MR. WHEATLEY*

We say that, first, if you read

7

the contracts, the plain language of the contracts and

8

the consistent practice under those contracts, and up to

9

this case as well as the interpretation of the words in

10

the contract by other courts ani by the Federal Power

Commission, those kinds of words in the whole group of

12

Sierra-Mobile cases, if

But what if all you had was the

Could it

If you put — no, clearly not.

18

If you put aside the clear language of

19

which go beyond the language of the statutory in being

20

explicit that you need a final order and that interim

21

rates are not permitted, you still have the language of

1

until this case, that Act was consistently construed as

2

requiring the final approval by the Federal Fower

3

Commission, and even as we read — every court that

considered this, it was three district courts and the

5

Court of Claims, the Federal Circuit Court and the Fifth

6

Circuit, all six of those courts, to our opinion, in

your question is whether, whether you needed a final

Of course, an interim rate isn't so

think a question of what — it could be important in an

inflationary period, yes, but on the other hand, the

affect the argument based on the language of the

Well, it could be that is so,

buc certainly .»hen the Power Act and the Gas Act were

19

enacted in 1915, Congress put in express interim rate

20

authority, and it seems strange that in 1944,

a few years after that, they didn't put the same

authority in there if they thought it was important and

because the Department of Energy Act, when it was

think there's one bottom line that comes out.
