OPAL ARGUMENT OF REX E. LEE, ESQ.,
DM 3EHALF 0? THE PETITIONER
MR. LEE*

Thank you,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

10

it please the Court,

11

that requires a simple solution.

12

case is here is that the Court of Appeals committed an

13

error which not even the respondents defend, and all that

14

this Court need do and all that it should do is to

15

reverse that error and remind the case so that the lower

16

courts can perform the task that is properly theirs.

17

There is one question presented.

in our view this is a simple case
The only reason the

It concerns

18

the correctness of the Seventh Circuit's holding that

19

there is an exception to the foundational principal that

20

before requiring arbitration of a collective bargaining

21

agreement, the Court must first determine whether the

22

partias agcaad to arbitrata that issue.

23

In the Court of Appeals* view, the exception

24

exists where the judge in order to decide whether there

25

has been a promise to arbitrate, would have to consider

1

any provision of the contract other than the arbitration

2

clausa.

3

The issue arose here because the petitioner

4

laid off 79 installers at its Chicago based location.

5

Tha union claims tut Article 20 of the collective

6

bargaining agreement makes these layoffs arbitrary.

7

company's answer is that Article 20 does not change

8

Article 9's exclusion of all layoff decisions from issues

9

that are to be arbitrated, and the company places

The

10

particular emphasis on a prior judicial interpretation of

11

this contract and other bargaining history.

12

Now, unier those circumstances, were the

13

parties in disagreement over whether there had been a

14

promise to arbitrate?

15

done and what both parties and all three amici agreed

16

that the lower courts should have done was to give the

17

parties their judgment on that issue.

18

arbitrability, arbitrability is for the courts, and these

19

courts should have decided it.

20

What the lower courts should have

Had they done so,

The issue is

then no matter which way they

21

decided it, this would have been in respondent's words a

22

thoroughly uneventful case involving nothing more than

23

the interpretation of one labor contract and eminently

24

unworthy of review by this Court.

25

happened.

But that is not what

(202) 628-9300

1

Both the District Court sad also the Court of

2

Appeals would have sent the case directly to the

3

arbitrator without performing their threshold duty of

4

deciding whether the party ever intended this issue to be

5

arbitrated.

6

sidestepping of what it conceded was its normal duty, was

7

required because of the interaction of two features of

8

this case.

9

The Seventh Circuit’s view,

this

First, the parties have not clearly excluded

10

the arbitrability issue from arbitration, and second, in

11

order to determine i:bitraoility,

12

consider not just the arbitration clause. Article VIII,

13

but also two what the Court called substantive clauses.

14

Articles IX and XX.

15

the Court would have to

That decision is hopelessly inconsistent with

16

this Court's holdings and opinions and also with the

17

policy of encouraging arbitrat ion.

18

19

two-part test .

20

The first is that

I would like to

and this is a quote,

What we want out of this case is a

that a judge can decide whether the parties have

quite different purposes, and they ask quite different

questions, and this brings me to what T submit is really

the key to this Court’s solution of this case.

questions.

And

the key

What no one at t.nis bar is urging is that this

15

Court should simply agree with the Seventh Circuit that

16

the arbitrator should decide arbitrability.

respondents do, however, suggest two possible bases for

Let me deal

They suggest first that the Court of Appeals

21

really made findings which would support a holding of

arbitrability, and in the alternative they suggest that

"arbitrability" in other tnan its asual sense, and that

Those contentions simply miss the point
entirely.

Whether the wori

"arbitrability" has one

meaning or two or four is quite irrelevant.

The

5

controlling fact is that we conteni that the parties have

6

agreed that disputes over layoffs are not to be decided

by an arbitrator, and this one is no different, and that
is what the parties have contracted.

squarely support us.

If there are two views of what the

Appeals adopted the wrong rationale, that your opponent

is right on the issue of arbitrability?

Well, they of course point out first

23

of all that what the Seventh Circuit did was a dangerous

position.

and they urge that we ought no longer to use the word

2

"arbitrability" in rannarti. on with -- meaning the

3

jurisdiction of the arbitra tors which is to be decided by

4

the courts.

5

Sy response to tn at is twofold.

6

I think it is unnecessary, quite unnecessary to the

7

decision in this case, baca use regardless of whether that

8

phrase has one meaning or t hree or for, the fact of the

9

matter is, we have never ha d a judicial decision on

The first is,

10

whether these parties intei led this dispute to be

11

arbitrated or not.

12

And finally, I tn ink it would be a bad idea and

13

the reason it would be a bi d idea is that over the years

14

the word "arbitrability" ha s become a word of art.

15

look through this Court’s i ecisions, every one of them
