PROCEEDINGS
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Mr. Hansen, I think you

may proceed whenever you are ready.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF WALTER D. HANSEN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
MR. HANSEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:,
In the spring of 1983, Florida enacted and began
collecting an unapportioned fuel tax on aviation fuel

10

uplifted in Florida by Wardair, a Canadian airline, and

11

by other foreign airlines, such fuel to be used exclusively

12

in international commerce.

13

Wardair challenged the validity of that tax in

14

a Florida circuit court on the grounds that it was

15

unconstitutional and that it violated the terms of the

16

Nonscheduled Air Services Agreement between the United

17

States and Canada, an agreement which regulates the

18

foreign air transport services which Wardair can provide

19

in and out of the United States.

20

The circuit court held that the tax was

21

constitutional, but that it did violate the terms of the

22

bilateral agreement and issued an appropriate injunction.

23

On appeal, the case was certified to the Florida

24

Supreme Court and that court again held the tax to be

25

constitutional, but that it did not violate the terms of
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the bilateral agreement because there was no exemption

2

from the payment of a state fuel tax.

3

That decision is at total odds with Japan Line

4

against the County of Los Angeles in which this Court held

5

that the California tax on cargo containers used exclusively

6

in international commerce and owned by foreign nationals

7

was unconstitutional even though there was no specific

8

federal prohibition against the tax.

9

The question in this case is identical to the

10

question in the Japan Line decision, whether a state has

11

the power to tax an instrument of foreign commerce owned

12

by foreign nationals and used exclusively in international

13

commerce.

14

The Japan Line case is a pure one involving,

15

as it does, solely the power over foreign commerce, an

16

exclusive preserve of the federal government, with no parts

17

shared with the individual states.

18

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Hansen, in Japan Line I

19

think the Court at least expressed considerable concern,

20

reliance upon the asymmetry that would exist, and here,

21

I guess, Canada imposes a tax on fuel under the same

22

circumstances that Florida does.

23

MR. HANSEN:

Yes, you are quite right, Justice

24

O'Connor.

25

enter into this case as an issue.

But, it is my belief that that fact does not
What it does do is

2

QUESTION:

But, certainly — It certainly cuts

3

back on the reliance you can place on Japan Lines in my

4

view.

5

MR. HANSEN:

Well, no, I respectfully disagree.

6

What it does show, Justice O'Connor, is that if there is

7

a method to remedy the problem that the United States may

8

have with Canada as to this reciprocity, the federal

9

government has to have the exclusive power to devise the

10
11

remedy to suit the national interest.

It cannot be worried

about what the individual states may do with that circum­

12

stance.

13

has to have the power to attempt to remedy and it is doing

14

that right now.

16

QUESTION:

MR. HANSEN:

18

QUESTION:

MR. HANSEN:

24
25

Yes.

The tax is a tax --

It is not imposed by dominion plenum,

It is imposed by the provinces,

just like Florida is imposing a tax here.

22
23

Well, isn't the Canadian counterpart

it is imposed by a couple of provinces.

20
21

The federal government

provincial rather than national?

17

19

It has to have the power.

I might suggest, however, that insofar as that
problem is concerned, there are several things to
consider.
One, to my knowledge, there has not been a U.S.

air carrier which has challenged that tax in Canada.
Two, there is presently a diplomatic initiative
in an attempt to seek a remedy to that problem.
And, three, one of the United States air carriers

5

that performs service to Canada has joined with other

6

carriers in an amici brief supporting Wardair's case today.

7

In the Containers Corp. of America against the

8

Franchise Tax Board, this Court commented on the Japan

9

Line case, saying that it was consistent with international

10

practice and expressed federal policy.

11

pure case involving the power of the federal government

12

over foreign commerce.

13

And, this case is as pure.

That case is a

It is Wardair's

14

contention that the Japan Line decision should be

15

considered here.

16

QUESTION:

Mr. Hansen, just to clear up one point

17

for me to be sure I am right on it, you do not contend,

18

as I understand your position, that there is a violation

19

of any specific treaty between the United States and your

20

executive agreement?

21

MR. HANSEN:

22

QUESTION:

23

Canada, either one.

24
25

MR. HANSEN:
Canada is concerned.

By the Florida tax?
Yes, or by the provincial tax in

Well, I can't answer insofar as
I do know that the provision in

(202) 628-9300

1

the Nonscheduled Air Services Agreement shows that the

2

countries are to provide these tax exemptions to the best

3

possible way that the national law will provide.

4
5

6

Now, whether or not Canada can do anything about
this problem, I don't really know.
QUESTION:

Well, just more narrowly, as I read

7

your brief, you did not contend that the Florida tax

8

violated that convention.

9

MR. HANSEN:

Well, I did insofar as it violated

10

the — what those tax exemptions demonstrate and they

11

demonstrate just what this Court concluded was demonstrated

12

by the Customs Convention on Containers in Japan Line.

13

It demonstrated a desirability for a uniform —

14

QUESTION:

But, that all is support for your

15

basic argument that Japan Line controls as a matter of

16

constitutional law.

17

MR. HANSEN:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
But, as I understand, you do not

19

independently argue that the convention itself provides

20

a federal reason for holding a state tax unconstitutional.

21

Maybe you did.

22

I missed it.

MR. HANSEN:

There is no specific exemption from

23

a state tax in the Chicago Convention or the Nonscheduled

24

Air Services Agreement.

25

In Japan Line there were three elements which
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

were essential to the Court's decision.

And,

Now, an instrument of foreign commerce is no

10
11

term of art.

Means of commerce is another way of

12

expressing it as shown by this Court in Helson against

13

Kentucky where it found that fuel used to propel a

14

transport vehicle was an instrument of commerce.
In Japan Line, the Court found that the cargo

15
16

containers were instrument of foreign commerce as a matter

17

of law based on the tax exemption provisions contained

18

in Customs Convention on Containers.

19

for cargo containers used exclusively in international

20

commerce the convention provided an exemption from

21

national import duties and national import taxes and that

22

is all.

23

Court held the California tax to be unconstitutional.

24
25

In that convention

It did not exempt from any state taxes, yet this

(202) 628-9300

1

exemptions almost exactly the same as those contained in

2

the Customs Convention on Containers plus other state

3

exemptions for aviation fuel uplifted — I am sorry, used

4

exclusively in international commerce and cover fuel which

5

is uplifted in the territory of one country by the carrier

6

of another, thus Wardair's aviation fuel uplifts in Florida

7

are covered.

8
9

Now, the Court in Japan Line showed that it was
not important whether the exemption granted an exemption

10

from state taxes.

11

what the tax exemption demonstrates.

12

reasoned that the tax exemption provision evidenced a

13

desirability for a uniform federal regulation of containers

14

used exclusively in international commerce and reflected

15

a federal policy to remove all impediments as to their

16

use as instruments of foreign commerce.

17

What it did show is what it demonstrates,
And, the Court

It was on that basis that the Court held that

18

since the California tax frustrated the attainment of that

19

federal regulatory uniformity, it was inconsistent with

20

the power of Congress over foreign commerce and, therefore,

21

unconstitutional.

22
23

That same reasoning and that same ultimate
conclusion is as applicable in this case.

24

Florida's tax on Wardair's fuel was uncon­

25

stitutional because it was a serious infringement on
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the power of Congress over foreign commerce.
There is another element here that is not

2
3

contained in the Japan Line case that bolsters the case

4

against the Florida fuel tax.
Congress has expressed a clear mandate through

5

6

the Federal Aviation Act requiring the uniform federal

7

regulation of foreign air transportation.

8

Congress deregulated domestic air transportation almost

9

eight years ago, the federal government still regulates

Even though

10

on a highly structured basis through the Federal Aviation

11

Act all foreign air transportation and the reason is clear.

12

United States air carrier participation in foreign air

13

transportation is totally dependent upon the ability of

14

the federal government to operate effectively in regulating

15

foreign air transportation with foreign governments and

16

reaching adequate international regulatory agreements or

17

understandings based on reciprocity and comity.

18

The uniform federal regulation of foreign air

19

transportation by the federal government is absolutely

20

essential if that national interest purpose is to be

21

met.

22

By Section 1102 of the Federal Aviation Act,

23

Congress enacted a set of goals to be met through the

24

International RegulatoryAgreement signed by the United

25

States.

Those goals include the reduction of
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

discrimination and the increased competition opportunities
by the United States air carriers in foreign air trans­
portation.
Any unilateral state action which may disrupt
the regulatory balance as to foreign air transportation
reached by the International Regulatory Agreements signed
by the United States would either impair or thwart the
achievement of those statutory goals set by Congress and
thereby infringe on Congress' power over foreign commerce.
There is one other aspect to this case.

If there

is proliferation of any such interferences by states such
as Florida's tax on Wardair's fuel, in the words of this
Court in Japan Line, would make speaking with one voice
impossible, yet if the Florida Supreme Court is not
reversed here, such a proliferation will take place.
The amici brief supporting Florida in this case makes that
fact known very clearly.
Now, this case concerns solely the power of the
federal government to regulate foreign air transportation
in concert with its foreign government partners and to
devise such remedies as the national interests warrant
when there are disagreements with those partners.
This power over foreign commerce -QUESTION:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ALBERT G. LAUBER, JR., ESQ.

1

IN SUPPORT OF APPELLANT

2

MR. LAUBER:

3
4
5

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Let me begin by saying a word about the Canadian

6

problem we have in the case.

It is somewhat ironic that

7

this case involves a carrier from the only nation in the

8

world that to our knowledge lets its political subdivisions

9

impose taxes on aviation fuel use by foreign carriers.

10

Two Canadian Provinces, Quebec and Alberta,

11

exempt foreign carriers from the tax, but the balance

12

do impose a tax.

13

I should note that the State Department has not

14

yet determined finally whether these Canadian provincial

15

taxes do breach reciprocity.

16

do, but that question is often a rather ambiguous one.

17

QUESTION:

We think that they probably

Is there some argument — some plausibl

18

argument to be made, Mr. Lauber, do you think, that

19

although the Florida tax does breach reciprocity the

20

Canadian provincial tax don't?

21

MR. LAUBER:

Well, I can imagine arguments

22

Canada might try to make to defend the tax.

23

try and defend the tax in some kind of price equalization

24

measure to bring up the eastern seaboard prices to the

25

level comparable to western.

They might

it.

We think they probably could not do that successfully.

2

We think here it is quite clear that these

3

taxes do breach reciprocity.

4

might be very unclear.

5

QUESTION:

But, in other cases, it

It is very often —

You mean just something out of the

6

air.

7

some treaty or some executive agreement?

Reciprocity would be some principle or do you mean

8
9

MR. LAUBER:

By that we mean the international

consensus that aviation fuel used by foreign carriers in

10

foreign commerce should be exempt from all taxes except

11

those imposed by the home country of the airline and

12

that —

13
14

QUESTION:

Where do you find that consensus

reflected, in some document or —

15

MR. LAUBER:

Well, the Chicago Convention by

16

its terms says that foreign carriers are to be exempt from

17

tax on aviation fuel they bring into a country, exempt

18

both from national taxes and local taxes.

ratified by the Senate.

If the tready pre-empted the tax, you wouldn't be here.

2

However, the International Civil Aviation

3

Organization which is an arm of the Convention has

4

adopted resolutions which have extended the exemption from

local and national taxes to include that only fuel brought

into a country, but fuel, equipment, and supplies taken

on board within the country.

QUESTION:

9

MR. LAUBER:

Whose resolution is that?
That is International Civil Aviation

10

Organization.

11

it expresses the strong commitment of all parties to the

Convention to this policy of reciprocal tax exemption

13

for aviation fuel.

That resolution has no force of law, but

But, in our view, the key thing is it is not
the particular taxing practices of different foreign
countries or their provinces that determine the outcome
here.

It is the federal policy of reciprocal exemptions.

this situation resolved and Florida's action has impeded
our ability to do that because we can't really promise

MR. LAUBER:

a very strong federal and international commitment to

22

avoiding the kinds of taxes involved here.

We depend on them the way the

shipping company in Japan Line depended on the Container

7

strong federal and worldwide commitment to a tax exemption

8

for Chicago Container.

9

That multilateral compact did not pre-empt

So, we think just as the Container Convention

10

was evidentiary of the correct result while not despositive

11

in Japan Line, the same is true here of the Chicago

12

Convention

in the various bilateral agreements.
QUESTION:

13

Would the agreements now in existence

14

between this country and other countries, would they

15

forbid the United States from imposing a tax on aviation

17

19

MR. LAUBER:

Clearly.

The agreements all bar

national taxes.
QUESTION:

Well, wouldn't you think that if they

20

wanted to go farther, they should have gone farther?

21

These agreements directed themselves to taxation and they

22

didn't touch local taxes.

23

MR. LAUBER:

But, the same is true in Japan Line,

only to that degree and the Court nevertheless held that

despite the lack of expressed pre-emption there is still

a violation of the Commerce Clause.

They addressed taxes

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Lauber, does Section 1513(b)

14

of Title 49 which says states can levy sales taxes have

15

any application here?

16

MR. LAUBER:

I think not, Justice O'Connor.

17

Were it not for — That section makes it clear that a sales

18

tax per se can be levied on airlines which means the

19

domestic airlines can be required to be paid the tax,

20

but whether the tax can be applied constitutionally to

21

one group of airlines, namely the foreign airlines, is

22

a constitutional question which Congress didn't address

23

in that statute.

24
25

QUESTION:

Yes.

The statute does not

differentiate between foreign and domestic flights.

MR. LAUBER:

That is correct.

had a rather narrow purpose.

But, that statute

It was enacted as part of

an overruling of this Court's decision which allowed a
head tax to be imposed, a per-passenger head tax by
states, and Congress declared in Section A of that
provision that head taxes could not be imposed, thereby
overruling the Court's decision.

But then to reassure

the states it enacted B which said that other taxes of
general application were not pre-empted.
But, we don't think Congress had in mind any­
thing like what we have here which is a tax imposed on
foreign airlines, fuel use in foreign commerce.
Let me say one thing about Justice Stevens'
question about the containers in Japan Line.

Our view

would be that if the containers — if the Japanese
company there bought containers in California to replace
containers on their container ships and used them solely
in foreign commerce, they would have an exemption from
sales tax.

They would not be exempt from equipment they

bought in the state to be used in California.
QUESTION:

What, about the emphasis in the Japan

case of the risk of mulitple taxation?

Do you have that

risk here?
MR. LAUBER:

We think there is no risk of that

here.
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

At least on that ground it is

different from Japan Line?
MR. LAUBER:

It is different, but the Court in

Japan Line quite clearly said that if the state tax either
creates a risk of multiple taxation or prevents federal
uniformity from being achieved, it would be invalid.
And, in fact, I think in Container Corporation
where the Court did find multiple taxation, they neverthe­
less upheld the California unitary income tax on a U.S.
company.

We think that shows that the multiple taxation

is not really the key to Japan Line because that aspect
was present in Container Corporation.

I think what Con­

tainer shows is that the key to Japan Line is really the
second part of the test which we do have here.
Thank you.

Mr. Mellichamp?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH C. MELLICHAMP, III, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE
MR. MELLICHAMP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question presented in this case is whether
the excise tax, which is a sales tax, imposed by Florida
upon the privilege of engaging in the business of selling
tangible personal property, which in this case includes
aviation fuel, unconstitutionally impairs the power of

1

the federal government to regulate foreign commerce.

2

The case is a narrow constitutional challenge

3

to the exercise of this fundamental state power, the power

4

to tax, the power to tax purchases of goods in the state.

5

The challenge by the Appellant rests on two

6

grounds and those two grounds are set forth in the Japan

7

Line case of this Court.

8

when you are looking to taxes that affected foreign

9

commerce there were two additional tests beyond that in

10

the Complete Auto case.

11

case.

12

In that case this Court said

There were four of them in that

In this case, the tax unquestionably passes the

13

four-prong test in Complete Auto.

14

in Japan Line.

15

We are left with two

The first in Japan Line was the risk of multiple

16

taxation.

17

such risks of multiple taxation in this case unlike in

18

Japan Line where there was an ad valorem tax on a

19

container and that container could be taxed somewhere else,

20

and in that case in Japan — In fact, was taxed in Japan.

21

The parties in this case concede there are no

In this case, we have an excise tax or sales

22

tax upon the privilege of doing business in the State of

23

Florida.

24
25

That incident can only be taxed once.
The second ground in Japan Line and the ground

that the Appellant relies on is that it prevents the

2

the Appellant's position that there are two grounds for

3

finding a violation of this test.

4

And, it is

The first ground was that the tax, the sales

5

tax involved in this case was pre-empted by federal

6

legislation and the international agreements or the

7

executive agreements involved in this case.

8

ground was that the state excise tax impermissibly

9

intrudes upon the federal government's power over foreign

10
11

And, the second

affairs.
On the first issue of pre-emption, they claim

12

that under the Federal Aviation Act that the Congress has

13

pre-empted this entire area.

14

that there is nothing contained in any of the provisions

15

they cite that pre-empts the state from imposing an

16

otherwise valid sales tax, in fact, such as before the

17

Court today.

18

I would submit to the Court

And, in fact, Section 1513(b) evidences Congress'

19

intend to preserve that souce of income to the State of

20

Florida, in other words, sales tax.

21

as this Court found in the Aloha case, Congress preserved

22

that right or reserved that right to the states, whereas

23

in subsection (a) of that section it prohibited or pre­

24

empted certain state taxes.

25

And, that section,

So, now we are down to the international

government has spoken 'in these agreements?

5

that in those agreements what the federal government has

done is reserve its sovereign right to allow the states

7

to tax as they please as long as the tax is not dis­

8

criminatory in this area of sales tax.

9

The question when you look at the international

The agreement itself speaks only to national'

excise taxes.

11

national and local taxes on fuel brought into the country.

12

The Convention of 1944 speaks only of

The resolution that was mentioned by the

13

Appellant that was done in 1966, while it speaks to state

14

taxes or taxes on a local level, this resolution, I

15

submit, has never been incorporated into this agreement

16

or any other of the agreements.

17

In fact, the United States has reserved its

18

sovereign power in this area in these agreements.

19

of the other agreements mentioned by the various amicus

20

in this case, some of the newer agreements after 1978,

21

use the term "best efforts" and this begs the question, if

22

Some

the United States in these agreements, other agreements

23

involved in this case, are saying they will use their best

24

efforts, it is an admission that the agreements don't cover

25

this area.

It is an admission that the federal government

2

the states to tax as they please as long as it is not dis­

So, the federal policy is not there.

13

the State of Florida to do.

14

QUESTION:

In this case, Canada, under this

But, Florida, counsel, reserves the

15

right to tax other foreign airplanes besides Canadian

16

17

MR. MELLICHAMP:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Rehnquist.

So, that may be a good defense to

19

this case, but how about Florida's assertion of a power

20

to tax, say, you know, a plane flying from Miami to London,

21

a British plane, or a Belgium plane flying from Brussels

22

to Miami?

23

MR. MELLICHAMP:

None of the agreements that

24

are before this Court, Justice Rehnquist, affect or

25

discuss or pre-empt or prohibit state excise taxes or

The Solicitor General in his brief points this

out.

4

the sovereign right of the United States to allow the

5

states to tax as they please as long as it doesn't dis­

7

None of them talk about it.

QUESTION:

All of them reserve

Well, do think then the fact that

8

the Canadian provinces that are imposing a tax here —

9

Is it kind of a make weight argument for your side or is

10

it a pretty important argument or does it really not amount

11

to very much?

12

MR. MELLICHAMP:

When you are looking to see

13

what these agreements cover and how the people that

14

negotiated them, the nations that negotiated them, felt

15

were covered, what were covered in these agreements, it

16

has considerable weight, because in this case, the other

17

nation in this case considers the agreements not to pro­

18

hibit such taxation by their subnational units of

19

government and in that respect it has some weight.

20

The other source of federal policy only exists

21

in the brief of the Solictor General and only at the

22

request of this Court was that brief submitted.

23

Florida submits to this Court that the agree­

24

ments, the Convention evidences the federal policy

25

was not evident

that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

in the Container case.

In that case, this Court found that

2

on numerous occasions treaties were entered into by the

3

United States, but specifically would not address the

4

taxation of income by states.

5

I submit in this case the same is evident for

6

this Court, that in numerous, in all occasions in these

7

executive agreements entered into by the federal government,

8

none of them prohibit the states from imposing sales tax.

9

All of them reserve the United States sovereign power to

10
11

allow the states to do this just as in the Container case.
I would submit that Florida's tax has not been

12

pre-empted, that Florida's tax does not impair the ability

13

of the federal government to speak with one voice and,

14

as such, the tax is not unconstitutional.
