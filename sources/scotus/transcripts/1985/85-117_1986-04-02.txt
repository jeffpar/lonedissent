ORAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN ROSSEN, ESQ.
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS

5

MR. ROSSEN:

6
7

Thank you, Mr. Chief, Justice,

and may it please the Court:
Appellants are non-striking General Motors employees

8
9

Mr. Rossen, I think you

who were laid off due to strikes elsewhere.

It is agreed

10

that the only basis for the labor dispute disqualification

11

in this case was because they pay emergency dues.

12

The issue is may a state deny unemployment com­

13

pensation to these Appellants solely because they paid

14

emergency or increased dues lawfully required as a condition

15

of remaining union members where the dues were for the

16

union strike fund from which strikers later receive strike

17

benefits.

18

Appellant's union had a convention in October

19

and voted to require as a condition of membership emergency

20

dues of all UAW members in the United States and Canada.

21

And, it is agreed and stipulated that these Appellants

22

paid $20 to $40 each for the months of October and November,

23

1967 to their own local unions which then sent the increase

24

or emergency dues to the international union's strike

25

fund.
3

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Appellants continued working at their own plants.

1

2

Their local union settled their contract which Appellants

3

ratified.

4

That year there was no national strike at General

5

Motors Corporation.

Instead, the General Motors agreement

6

was settled in December and ratified by the union members.

7

In late January, three General Motors foundry

8

locals went on strike over local issues and after those

9

11 to 12-day strikes ended, they received no more than

10
11

$18 from the international union's strike fund.
Those foundry strikes caused part shortages

12

and resulted in layoffs at Appellant's plant.

13

were comparatively few members at each plant who were

14

selected because they had low seniority and they were

15

laid off from those plants by General Motors and they

16

applied for unemployment compensation for that February,

17

three months after they paid those dues.

18

eligible under state law in the sense that they had worked

19

long enough to earn their compensation, they had enough

20

credit weeks, they were available for work, they were

21

seeking work, they wanted to continue working, and they

22

were involuntarily unemployed.

23

Appellants

They were found

The labor dispute disqualification was asserted

24

as a reason for denying them compensation and under all

25

aspects or all parts of the Michigan Labor Dispute statute,
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

they were not disqualified except one.

2

that is they were held by all agencies and courts to not

3

be in the same locations as the strikers, they were not

4

participating in any foundry strikes, they were not

5

interested in them in the sense that they could not benefit

6

from them nor could they influence those negotiations

7

or strikes.
They were disqualified because they had financed

8
9

What we mean by

the labor dispute as held by the Michigan court because

10

they had paid those increased or emergency dues the previous

11

October.

12

If possible, we would like to get into our argument

13

a little bit and then try to respond to some of the points

14

made by General Motors.

15

It is pretty well agreed that Appellants would

16

not have been disqualified from their unemployment compensa­

17

tion but for the facts that they chose to remain union

18

members and paid these increased or emergency dues.

19

The Michigan Supreme Court correctly held that

20

this conflicts with their Section 7 right to assist their

21

union and it also conflicts with their right to join and

22

remain union members if they choose to do so.

23

Under this Court's ordinary preemption rules,

24

state action which conflicts with such Section 7 rights

25

would be preempted, wouldn't stand, unless Congress affirma5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

tively intended to allow such a conflict.
QUESTION:

2
3

Mr. Rossen, did any workers refuse

to pay the increased dues?

4

MR. ROSSEN:

It is stipulated, Justice O'Connor,

5

at page 173 of the record that all claimants paid these

6

dues, these emergency dues in accordance with the UAW

7

Constitution.

8

refused to pay the dues.

Thus, there is no evidence that anyone

QUESTION:

9

What would the union do with a member

10

who refused to pay the increased dues for the purposes

11

of financing the strike?
MR. ROSSEN:

12

There is no evidence that the union

13

took any action against any of the members in terms of

14

trying to get someone's job or anything else under Section

15

8(a)(3).

16

required dues under the union constitution and, in fact,

17

it is stipulated and found that they were paid under the

18

union constitution and, thus, they were required to be

19

union members.

20

It is our position that the dues were lawfully

So, failure to pay those dues based on those

21

stipulations would jeopardize a person's union membership

22

if he refused or she refused to pay those dues.

23

QUESTION:

Do you concede that the state can

24

disqualify non-strikers who finance a strike by means

25

of payments other than in the form of union dues?
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. ROSSEN:

1

Below and in this Court we have

2

not ask that the Michigan financing disqualificational

3

provision be striken.

QUESTION:

5

MR. ROSSEN:

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. ROSSEN:

8

QUESTION:

9

On its face.
Pardon?
On its face you mean.
On its face, that is right.
So you concede then that it can apply

if it is payment other than union dues?

10

MR. ROSSEN:

We concede that it can apply and

11

be used as a disqualification when it is not based on

12

the exercise of someone's Section 7 rights.
QUESTION:

13

I don't think that answers the question.

14

That really doesn't answer the question, because, in effect,

15

it would be an exercise of a Section 7 right to finance

16

a strike, wouldn't it?

17

MR. ROSSEN:

Well, it may or may not, Justice

18

Stevens.

19

20

might send money if there is an existing strike and that
*
individual could do it alone, that individual may or may

21

not be a union member, and that might be used as a basis

22

for disqualifying someone from financing and it would

23

not involve the exercise of Section 7 rights.

24
25

For example, there are situations where an individua

QUESTION:

What if you did not — I am still

not sure of your answer to Justice O'Connor's question
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

is why I am following up.
What if they had just sent out a special assessment

3

for the purpose of financing the strike and then as a

4

byproduct of that strike these people were laid off

5

temporarily.

6
7

What your position be?

MR. ROSSEN:

Well, our position first of all

is that is not what happened here.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. ROSSEN:

10

misunderstanding on that score.

11

that and all the money was going to the strikers —

12

13
14

It is a different case, I understand.

QUESTION:

But, I didn't want to leave any
But, if the union did

Well, it goes into a large fund and

the fund in turn is used to support the —
MR. ROSSEN:

I was going to say if the money

15

was going to the strikers and the union is a mere collection

16

agent, I am not sure if it makes a difference if it is

17

labelled dues or not and I am not sure that* would really

18

involve assisting the union, even though the union is

19

a collection agent, any more than if the union collects

20

money for the United Fund and sends it to someone.

21

But, if the money goes into a large pot, then

22

I think — into the union's strike fund, even though unlike

23

this case there is an existing strike at the time, then

24

I think the case would be very much like General Motors

25

versus Bowling which was decided by the Illinois Supreme
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Court and the Illinois Supreme Court there said that because

2

the union was really deciding how this money was going

3

to be paid, the union would decide when to pay it and

4

how much and to whom, and it was not these dues — and

5

there they were people in the same plant paying dues,

6

increased dues, double dues, the Illinois Supreme Court

7

said it would not interpret financing under its statute

8

to apply to those payments because they were dues and

9

the union really was deciding how it ought to pay them.

10

Now, that is different from a situation where

11

the payer knows that 100 percent of the money paid is

12

going to — even if it goes into a pot — is going to

13

be sent to people on the existing strike.

14

But, we think the Bowling situation, the example

15

that I gave there, it is our position that that would

16

be preempted even though it would leave our case as a

17

much stronger case for preemption, we believe that there

18

also would be preemption in that case and that Congress

19

did not intend in the National Labor Relations Act or

20

the Social Security Act to disqualify anyone for financing,

21

let alone for paying dues.

22

Did that get closer?

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. ROSSEN:

25

Close.
In terms of the legislative history,

the National Labor Relations Act does not provide any
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

guidance as to congressional intent in this case.

And,

2

in 1935 when the Social Security Act was passed, there

3

was no financing provision in any state labor dispute

4

statute.
So, for that reason you cannot say, unlike in

5

6

New York Telephone, for example, where there was an existing

7

statute that Congress perhaps was aware of, you cannot

8

say that Congress was aware of any financing provision

9

in 1935.

10

Now, the State of Michigan relies on 1936 action

11

by the Social Security Board.

12

Act was passed where the Social Security Board recommended

13

changing the disqualification of everyone in a struck

14

establishment to only apply to situations where people

15

participate, finance, or are directly interested in those

16

excused within that establishment.

17

After the Social Security

But, in 1940, the Social Security Board, aware

18

of a few applications by state agencies, not courts,

19

recommended eliminating any financing provisions in these

20

statutes because, as the Social Security Board said, it

21

might be used to disqualify people for solely for payment

22

of dues.

23

Now, in 1943, Congress indicated its awareness

24

of this Social Security Board action because it changed

25

a District of Columbia statute to do as suggested in 1936
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

by adding participating and directly interest, but it

2

specifically omitted the financing provision.

3

And, since 1935, no state court until this Michigan

4

court has ever disqualified anyone under a financing pro­

5

vision for solely paying union dues.

6

Now, what we mean by that when we saying "for

7

solely paying union dues," we mean in other cases where

8

dues may have been involved, the people were also in the

9

same establishment as the strikers, they were also held

10

to be interested in the strike financially, and they were

11

also held to be participating, so there is no pure dues

12

holding in unemployment insurance history in the United States

13

by a court until this one, and there —

14

This gets to be a little bit back to Justice

15

Stevens' question.

16

flukey about this Michigan decision.

17

came out of English law and they were aimed at situations

18

where people in a factory were striking and other people,

19

knowing of those strikes, sent money to those strikers

20

when then caused their own layoffs.

21

There is something else that is also
The financing provisions

In every other financing decision in the United

22

States, including agencies, whether or not they involve

23

dues, they all involve the same situation of an existing

24

strike that people were sending money to.

25

We mention this because it emphasizes the unusual
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

quality and nature of the Michigan decision which makes

2

it, in our opinion, just as unusual as what Florida did

3

in Nash where Florida was the only state to interpret

4

its labor dispute disqualification in a bizarre way and

5

yet this Court, despite the fact that that was unusual,

6

did not allow Florida to punish that worker because she

7

exercised statutory rights.
General Motors relies on this Court's decision

8
9

in New York Telephone and says that because Congress,

10

as indicated in New York Telephone, was apparently aware

11

of a state statute which paid benefits to strikers after

12

disqualification and also disqualified strikers.

13

Therefore, it should be assumed that Congress

14

also intended to permit disqualifying anyone else who

15

exercises other Section 7 rights wherever there is a strike.

16

But, as Your Honors know, New York Telephone

17

rested on awareness by Congress of a specific statute

18

which did that, and as we have shown, there was no statute

19

in existence in 1935 that did what happened to these people.

20

And, the fact that Congress was aware that a

21

state may impede the right to strike does not mean that

22

Congress intended or should be implied to permit a state

23

to impede all other Section 7 rights or rather all other

24

NLRA rights, and certainly Nash is an example of that

25

holding.
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And, General Motors concedes in its brief that

2

the state could not disqualify persons because they are

3

union members.

4
5

So, there are situations where a state's labor
dispute disqualification has been limited.

6

And, striking for NLRA purposes and for unemploy­

7

ment insurance purposes is different than other Section

8

7 rights, particularly the rights of free association.

9

Strikers leave work and things can happen to

10

them under the NLRA that economically disadvantage them.

11

General Motors could have replaced the foundry strikers

12

if it had wished, permanent replace them, but General

13

Motors could not have punished these Appellants because

14

they chose to pay these dues even if there was a foundry

15

strike in existence at the time and even if some of those

16

dues reached those foundry strikers.

17

not have laid them off because they paid these dues, and

18

yet General Motors is asking this Court, as it did in

19

Michigan, to punish these claimants because they paid

20

these dues.

21

QUESTION:

I suppose, that they would otherwise have been qualified

for.

MR. ROSSEN:

Yes.

other respect but for the fact that they were held disqualifie

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

for paying these emergency dues, so they had met all the

2

other eligibility requirements.

3
4
5

QUESTION:

And you say that burdens their Section

7 rights?
MR. ROSSEN:

We do and Michigan did too.

The

6

Michigan Supreme Court agreed with that much and held

7

that there was a conflict.

8
9

And, this gets us close, I think, to what this
Court did yesterday in Golden State.

We are not asking

10

Michigan to pay benefits to these Appellants because they

11

paid their union dues.

12

benefits to these Appellants because they were laid off

13

and forced out of work.

14

We are asking Michigan to pay

And, yet, General Motors is asking Michigan

15

to deny benefits to these Appellants because they paid

16

those dues.

17

the state to condition denial just on their paying dues

18

which they were required to pay to remain members.

19

General Motors is conditioning — asking

And, this Court, every Justice of this Court

20

in recent cases, have expressed concerned for protection

21

Section 7 rights, particularly rights of employee self-

organization which we believe would include the right

23

to remain union members and to pay these dues.

24
25

unfettered, it seems to me that you should leave the right

MR. ROSSEN:

That is right.

And, they can replace

State statutes regularly disqualify strikers from unemploy­

Isn't that burdening Section 7 rights?
Yes, it does burden Section 7 rights

to deny benefits to strikers.

QUESTION:

21

MR. ROSSEN:

The state may do it because as

to permit them to do it.

-QUESTION:

Yes.

MR. ROSSEN:

And, strikers have not been treated

the same or synonymously with dues payers —
QUESTION:

But, the strikers' claims when they

5

are strikers — the claim still is that their Section

6

7 rights are being burdened by a refusal to pay unemployment

7

benefits, just like the claim is here that these people

8

who finance strikes are exercising their Section 7 rights.

9

MR. ROSSEN:

And but for Congress' awareness,

10

as indicated in New York Telephone, that might be considered

11

improper too.

12

But, strikers, even if there were no labor dispute

13

disqualification, Justice White, strikers are different

14

because they voluntarily leave their jobs and Congress

15

was probably aware that — in 1935 — people who leave

16

their jobs voluntarily generally don't get unemployment

17

compensation.

18

Even if you had no labor dispute statute --

19

I mean it is the traditional unemployment insurance concept,

20

as old as any unemployment insurance statute in history

21

that people who leave work are disqualified from unemployment

22

compensation.

QUESTION:

24

MR. ROSSEN:

25

How did these people lose their jobs?

at their plants who were laid off by General Motors when

they were on strike.

another reason.
MR. ROSSEN:

6

They were out of their jobs for

Yes, that is right.

They were

7

out of their jobs — They were involuntarily out of work,

8

laid off by General Motors because General Motors didn't

have enough parts because of those foundry strikes and

10

General Motors chose to lay off these Appellants, com­

11

paratively few Appellants at each plant which was a humane

12

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES

MR. NASH:

9

Mr. Nash, you may proceed

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I would like to briefly run over the facts again

10

quickly in this case to put them in perspective from General

11

Motors' point of view.

12

Here a special strike fund assessment or special

13

dues was made of UAW members, payments to be made in October

14

and were made in October and November of 1967, increasing

15

The benefits in this fund are paid not only

In January and February of 1968, what was

foundaries went out on strike and as a result of a lack

of employees, including all the Plaintiffs in this case,

were laid off at other GM plants because of the strike

They were denied — In this case, the Plaintiffs

14

were denied unemployment compensation benefits in the

State of Michigan because they had financed a strike which

16

had resulted in their unemployment.

ment those these special dues payments were, as found

by the Michigan Supreme Court, or did, as found by the

Mr. Nash, could the state treat the

MR. NASH:

That is not the case we have here.

1

QUESTION:

I know that.

2

MR. NASH:

That is a tougher case, but I think

3

analytically and at least arguably, yes, they could.

4

And, indeed, I think there are 37 states whose statutes

5

do, in fact, treat the payment of regular union dues as

6

a disqualification for unemployment compensation benefits.

7

There are a number of reasons for that, I think,

8

and the reasons for that primarily, however, I believe,

9

come from this Court's analysis of the unemployment compen­

10

sation system and the National Labor Relations Act and

11

New York Telephone.

12

This Court, at least as I read the decision

13

of all of the Justices in New York Telephone, determined

14

that Congress, when it enacted the National Labor Relations

15

Act, intended to leave the parties in a neutral position,

16

management and labor, each to bear the full economic

17

consequences of a strike.

and would lose money.

QUESTION:

Employees wouldn't be paid

Each side would bear the full

Well, in your view, I take it any

22

local strike supported by a national union strike fund

23

that leads to some lay offs of non-strikers will justify

24

denying the benefits to the non-strikers.

25

MR. NASH:

Whether it justifies it or not, in

3

Court is does the Constitution, does the National Labor

4

Relations Act and the Social Security Act allow the states

5

to so act.
QUESTION:

6
7

Well, maybe the question is whether

Congress authorized that result.
MR. NASH:

8
9

The question before this

Yes.

I believe the answer to that

question is yes, that Congress authorized that, not only

10

in terms of the National Labor Relations Act and the balance

11

of power struck, but more particularly —
QUESTION:

12

What is the evidence that leads you

13

to think that Congress intended to go so far as the

14

circumstances I have described with regular dues?
MR. NASH:

15

As I say, that is a tougher case

16

than ours.

17

what this Court found that Congress intended when it passed

18

the National Labor Relations Act was that each party bore

19

the economic consequences of that and that a state interfers

20

with and is preempted in its actions by the National Labor

21

Relations Act if it, in fact, shifts that economic burden

22

or changes that economic burden in either one of two ways.

23

Either it requires the employer to pay more, it costs

24

the employer more to take a strike, or if what the state

25

is doing cushions the impact of that strike upon employees.

But, as I see it, what Congress intended and

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

In New York Telephone, this Court, as I read

2

the decisions, said that absent the Social Security Act,

3

payment of benefits to strikers, unemployment benefits,

4

would be preempted by the National Labor Relations Act

5

because it does both those things.

6

Employers contribute to an unemployment compensa­

7

tion fund.

8

not only cushions the impact of that strike on those strikers,

9

but also costs the employer an awful lot more to take

10
11

If that money is paid to the strikers, it

that strike.
The same is true in this particular case.

If

12

an employer is required to pay benefits — employer to

13

the state unemployment compensation fund — is required

14

to pay benefits to those laid off as a natural consequence

15

of a strike, laid off in another plant, it costs the employer

16

more to take that strike because it has to pay benefits

17

to everybody that is laid off as a result of that strike.

18

And, particularly in this case, where the strike

19

fund pays benefits not only to strikers, but also to those

20

laid off as the result of a strike, unless those latter

21

people receive unemployment compensation benefits — If

22

the State of Michigan paid unemployment compensation benefits

23

to employees in this case who financed the strike, the

24

employer would have to pay for all of that.

25

And, in addition, the strike fund would not
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

diluted by that, thus giving additional economic power

2

to all the people on strike because their strike is going

3

to be bigger, bigger benefits could be paid over a longer

4

period of time.
So that the payment of benefits in this case

5

6

has the same effect of conflicting with policies of the

7

National Labor Relations Act as did the payment of strike

8

benefits or benefits to strikers in the New York Telephone

9

case.

10

The Court held in this case, however, that that

11

conflict with the National Labor Relations Act is allowed

12

and was intended to be allowed by Congress because Congress

13

passed the Social Security Act which granted to the states

14

broad powers to structure their social security systems

15

the way they wanted to structure them.

QUESTION:

Were the strikes here at the foundry

plants over purely local issues?
MR. NASH:

I don't know that, but I am assuming

that they were, yes.
QUESTION:

Because the national issue had already

been resolved.
MR. NASH:

That is correct, although that is

23

not necessarily true in local strikes and it was not true

24

in later — Or at least from GM's perspective it was not

25

true in later strikes at local plants.

QUESTION:

1

So, the non-striking workers we are

2

concerned about really didn't have any interest in those

3

local issues, I take it.

4

MR. NASH:

That is correct in this sense.

Well,

5

they had an interest in the strike to the extent that

6

any time their brethern are able to mount a strike they

7

have more solidarity and they are able to improve benefits

8

for them.

9

They did not have a direct interest in the strike.

10

Indeed, had they had a direct interest, we wouldn't be

11

here on this issue today because the Michigan statute

12

says that employees are disqualified from unemployment

13

compensation benefits if they are laid off as a result

14

of a strike in which they have a direct interest.

15

presumably they would have been denied benefits on that

16

basis rather than on the basis of having financed the

17

strike.

18

So,

But, the impact on the economic — The economic

19

impact is the same.

20

against the employer and in favor of the employees exactly

21

the same as it was in New York Telephone.

22

The balance in this case is tipped

To reiterate, this Court, however, found that

23

even though that conflicted in New York Telephone with

24

the National Labor Relations Act the state was allowed

25

to engage in that kind of conflict because Congress had
24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

passed the Social Security Act giving the states broad

2

power to structure their own unemployment compensation

3

system the way they wanted to.

4

And, as a consequence of that, even though those

5

payments in that case interferred with the strong policy

6

of the National Labor Relations Act for a state to remain

7

neutral, it was okay for the states to do it because Congress

8

had given the states the right to make those calls and

9

structure their own system.

10

That is the way we come at this case looking

11

at New York Telephone.

12

at it differently.

13

interferred with a Section 7 right of employees to finance

14

a strike, that is a Section 7 right, and as a consequence

15

you have got basically a Garmon preemption case that a

16

state can't act in such a way as to interfer with a Section

17

7 right.

18

The Plaintiffs in this case come

They say that here the employer has

First of all, we don't see that the inteference

19

with a Section 7 right is equivocal at all.

20

New York Telephone, as Mr. Justice White pointed out before

21

the break, in New York Telephone the state had it denied

22

unemployment compensation benefits, as every member of

23

this Court said they could have, would have interferred

24

with the Section 7 right to strike.

25

is to important that Congress went to all the trouble

Indeed, that right

Indeed, in

to pass Section 13 of the National Labor Relations Act

2

to restate once again that that was a protected right,

3

something it has not done with the financing of a strike.

4
5
6

So, the fact that it interfers with a Section
7 right should not make a difference.
And, in this particular case, the Section 7

7

allegedly interfered with the right to finance a strike

8

or finance a union — paying unemployment benefits to

9

those people has the same economic impact, i.e., the shifting

10

of the balance under the National Labor Relations Act

11

and the state ought to be able to do it.

12

QUESTION:

When members strike and a state denies

13

unemployment compensation, there is the same burden, I

14

suppose, on Section 7 rights.

15

MR. NASH:

That is correct.

16

QUESTION:

But, the reason it isn't an unfair

17

labor practice or the reason it isn't preempted is because

18

of the neutrality argument, I suppose.

a union.
MR. NASH:

10

What

That is correct, but that is all

part and parcel of the union bearing the natural economic
consequences of the strike.
In fact, when the employees go out on strike,

11
12

and in this case it is a very carefully drawn issue, here

13

employees of General Motors went out on strike and the

14

State Supreme Court found that, in fact, the employees

15

who were laid off and denied benefits here significantly

16

contributed to their unemployment because they contributed

17

to a strike fund which supported those people who went

18

out on strike.
That also comes close to what — or is consistent

19

20

with what the Social Security Act intended when it said

21

to the states, pass your own unemployment compensation

systems.

QUESTION:

There is no question about that?

2

MR. NASH:

No question.

They were laid off

3

because the foundries were struck by their fellow UAW

4

members in a. strike which they helped to finance by paying

5

these special dues to a strike fund and they were laid

6

off because the parts coming out of the foundries weren't

7

coming any more because of the strike and there wasn't

8

enough work for them in their plants.

9

QUESTION:

Well, I suppose if the foundry workers

10

had struck and then the employer locked everybody out,

11

what about the people who didn't strike but who were locked

12

out, but who had been contributing to the union?

13

MR. NASH:

The State of Michigan, under its

14

unemployment compensation statute, says that if an employer

locks out employees that does not disqualify them from

So, in this case, they would have been paid

MR. NASH:

That is correct.

But, a lock-out,

I think, really is normally defined by courts, labor board,

MR. NASH:

1

Well, it may be semantics in this

Court.

3

The State of Michigan determined that employees shall,

in fact, be paid unemployment compensation benefits unless

5

they contribute in some way to their own unemployment.

6

If they quit, they are fired for cause, a whole bunch

7

of ways in which a person contributes to his or her own

8

unemployment and, thus, is denied benefits. Had they gone

out on strike, they would have contributed obviously to

11

It was not semantics in the State of Michigan.

their own unemployment.
Financing a strike which resulted in their lay

12

off in view of the State of Michigan, and I think correctly

13

so in the interpretation of its statute, constitutes a

14

contribution by the employee to his own unemployment and

15

results in a denial of unemployment benefits.

16

These people then are eligible to receive benefits

17

under the UAW strike fund and really what we are talking

18

about here is shifting the funding of the UAW strike fund

19

at least indirectly from the UAW and its members to the

20

employer, General Motors in this case.

Would it have been an unfair labor

22

practice for the employer to fire these people for having

paid the special dues?

That is a Section

2

I think in that circumstance they were fired

illegally and, therefore, they probably would get the

unemployment benefits and they certainly would be eligible

for back pay in a National Labor Relations Board proceeding

6

if they then made an offer to return to work.

7

This case, however, is — and I would like to

8

stress at this point — not a question — doesn't present

9

the question which I think Jordan was really talking about

10

earlier of whether the State of Michigan correctly inter­

preted its statute, whether it went off on some whimsy,

whether or not the way the State of Michigan interpreted

in this case is is the State of Michigan free under the

it made?

Does that conflict with an act of Congress and

we submit it does not conflict, indeed, it is consistent
with the National Labor Relations Act.

It certainly is

consistent with what the Social Security Act, in fact,
allows the states to do and under those circumstances
there is no basis for saying that this act is preempted
by the National Labor Relations Act.

There is a strong national labor policy reiterated

One way to view this case is that it presents

the question whether a state is permitted to honor that

federal policy and deny unemployment compensation to employees

22

who the state found had paid extraordinary emergency dues

23

that foreseeably went to support a strike that foreseeably

24

caused their own unemployment or whether, as Appellant

suggests, the state is required to pay benefits because

3

The government, including the National Labor

involved the question whether the state could pay benefits.

14

This case involves what I think every member of the New

15

York Telephone court would have thought was the easier

16

question, whether the state can deny benefits.

17

19

QUESTION:

First, New York Telephone

Well, the payment of benefits didn't

involve the interference with any protected rights I gather.
MR. COHEN:

The payment did not.

The denial

20

of benefits, Justice White, would have burdened the exercise

21

of a Section 7 right to strike and yet I think it was

22

an assumption and Appellants have conceded here today

23

that the state was at least at liberty to deny benefits

24

in that situation.

25

QUESTION:

Yes, yes.

But, nevertheless, the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

argument against paying them was that the state shouldn't

2

upset this balance.

3

That is the argument.

MR. COHEN:

Yes.

We think that the same argument

4

is applicable here to the payment of benefits to people

5

who were found by the state to have been as closely allied

6

to the actual strikers as these Appellants were.

7

We think, indeed, that either the legislative

8

history nor the logic of New York Telephone suggests any

9

distinction.

10

I want, first of all, to stress that Appellants

11

are just wrong when they imply that the legislative history

12

of the Wagner Act and the Social Security Act in 1935

13

distinguishes in some way between actual strikers and

14

people who finance a strike that leads to their own

15

unemployment.

16

There is no such distinction.

There were, as the Court noted in New York Telephone,

17

five state unemployment compensation statutes that predated

qualified, or in the case of New York, delayed payments

and innocent bystandards.

a similarly broad disqualification and when Congress acting

2

as the District of Columbia legislature adopted an unemploy­

Nor was there any distinction between strikers

in the strike that caused their unemployment.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Cohen, do you think it makes

12

any difference whether the non-striking workers have a

13

direct interest in the issues of local strikes?

14

MR. COHEN:

I think that Michigan was entitled

15

to decide, as its legislature and its courts have, that

16

non-striking workers who pay extraordinary dues that can

17

be expected to finance other people's local strikers under

18

circumstances where it is foreseeable that that will cause

19

lay offs in their own plants, Michigan is entitled to

20

disqualify those people.

21

22
23

That is the basis.

QUESTION:

So, you would employ a foreseeability

Well, I think the State of Michigan

statement?

24

employed a foreseeability standard.

25

permitted them to do that.

I think that Congress

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

And, did Congress care whether it

was foreseeable?
MR. COHEN:

Well, I think that Congress should

be assumed to have cared about the policy of non-state
intervention in a labor dispute that is going on.
And, I think what Michigan did here was to find
that these employees were sufficiently directly involved
with the labor dispute that was going on, that payment
of benefits to them could constitute intervention which
they were entitled not to do.
QUESTION:

Do you think that payment of regular

dues could be financing in Congress' view?
MR. COHEN:

I want to agree with Mr. Nash that

that is not this case, disagree with him to the extent
of saying I think probably not.

I think that the rationale

that the — The purpose of Congress in the two statutes
was to permit the states to decide what they wished to
do in this specific — on the specific question of providing
assistance in the context of a labor dispute does not
extend to a disqualification because of the payment of
regular dues.
QUESTION:

It is an illusive distinction somewhat

though, isn't it?
MR. COHEN:
a grey area.

Well, I think as usual there is

I think Michigan worked for 20 years to

2

is a distinction between a decision not to finance people

3

who are directly involved in a particular labor dispute

4

to the extent that these were — and a decision to deny

5

benefits to people who are union members or have paid

6

regular dues because it happened that some of those dues

found their way into the hands of strikers.

8

was careful not to do that.

I think there

I wanted to say a word about the question of

10

whether this action was voluntary.

11

that among other things this Court’s decision in the Hodory

12

case and all of the legislative history that I have recited

13

that voluntariness is not a requirement of the federal

14

statute; that is a state is not required to find that

15

a worker is voluntarily unemployed before it may disqualify

16

him.

17

I think it is clear

I also think that voluntariness is an illusive

18

notion in the context of what are inherently collective

19

activities in which individuals may feel subject to varying

20

pressures.

21

For example, the decision by an individual not

22

to participate in a strike could well be a violation of

23

union rules subjecting him to some sort of discipline,

24

but would — But, it is nevertheless clear, I think, that

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JORDAN ROSSEN, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS — REBUTTAL

9

MR. ROSSEN:

Mr. Cohen may not think it is

10

important if it is voluntary, but Justice Ryan in his

11

opinion for the three justices of the Michigan Court said

12

that it was necessary to find voluntariness before you

13

disqualify people for financing.

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Was that a construction of the Michigan

law or a description of what Congress had permitted?
MR. ROSSEN:

It was a construction of the Michigan

17

law, not what Congress meant, and the reason I am making

18

the point, Justice Rehnquist, is that in order to find

19

voluntariness of these Appellants, Justice Ryan said they

20

will be presumed to have done this voluntarily if they

21

paid these dues in accordance with the union's rules and

22

constitution.

23

So, I think the whole thing is tied up and it

24

is not so much a question of whether the dues are regular

25

or irregular, it is the question — We say it is whether
40

QUESTION:

21

is in that situation you disqualify union members and

And, we don't

That does not involve Section

The question — Both counsel — The United States

5

didn't do it in its brief, but both counsel use what we

6

call a countervailing machinist's argument and say that

7

GM is hampered economically somehow if you pay these non­

8

strikers, and that therefore you should let Michigan impede

9

their expressed Section 7 rights.

10

The economic effect on GM's ability to conduct

11

the foundry strikes does not justify impeding these Section

12

7 rights.

13

When Congress provides for a Section 7 protected

14

right, by definition Congress also tolerates some implicit

15

economic effect on the employer or someone else.

16

you can't say this amounts to the type of congressional

17

intent that this Court found in New York Telephone where

18

there was an expressed awareness of these things.

19

So,

In effect, if you look at congressional intent,

20

in 1935, the state statutes that were then in existence

21

paid unemployment compensation to non-strikers at other

22

locations who were laid off during strikes.

23

So, if there is any economic imbalance here,

24

Congress was probably aware of it.

25

unemployment compensation is paid to people who are laid

And, when they say, in response to Justice

2
3

Marshall's question, that somehow these claimants con­

4

tributed to their unemployment, it is a little far-fetched,

5

we think, to say that when they paid $40 in October 1967

6

this caused a shortage of castings at the foundries in

7

January 1968.

8

there is no finding below to support that unusual theory.

I mean, I don't think anyone — Certainly

b

Nor is there a finding below to support GM's

9
10

arguments that these Claimants were allied with the foundry

11

workers.

12

that don't exist here and, as Justice O'Connor, I believe --

13

Her questions indicate some concern about this.

14

Appellants had been in league with the foundry workers,

15

closely allied with them or had there been a national

16

contract that was open that could have possibly benefited

17

them, they would have been disqualified under other

18

Michigan statute sections anyway.

concerns.
