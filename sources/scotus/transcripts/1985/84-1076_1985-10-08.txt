ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

Mr. Grower, I think you

MR. GROWER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation, which
I will call Transeo, is an interstate pipe line company

10

regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. It

11

purchases gas in the States of Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas

12

and off-shore.

13

stretching from Alabama to New York.

14

It transports that gas for resale in markets

For many years prior to the spring of 1982,-this

15

irterstate company, along with many other interstate purchasers,

16

were purchasing gas at a period of time when there was a

17

severe shortage.

18

t.iat their contract producers could deliver to them.

19

contracts provided that they could do so.

20

did not obligate them to take all of that gas, it only obligate:

21

them to take a certain minimum.

22

They were able to take all of the gas
Their

The contracts

These long-term contracts were part of the

23

regulatory scheme.

24

obligations and take or pay obligations if those minimum

25

takes were not made.

These contracts provided for minimum-take

1

However, in the spring, particularly May of 1982,

2

it became apparent to the gas industry as a whole

3

particularly that there was becoming a surplus of deliver-

4

ability of gas.

5

of reasons that I will not take my time here, the drop in

6

the price of oil, surplus oil, for many reasons.

7

was an unprecedented, an unforeseeable loss in the markets

8

for natural gas.

9

state pipe line companies, and Transeo in this case, could

That created a problem whereby the inter­

QUESTION:

In other words, they couldn't sell

it.
MR. GROWER:

That is exactly right, Your Honor.

They could not sell it.
QUESTION:

They could buy it.

They could buy

it if they had the money.
MR. GROWER:

The pipe line is not the market.

19

The pipe line is the conduit to the market and if the market

20

can't take it, they can't buy it.

It is that simple.

21

Now, when they were unable to buy all of their

22

contracted gas, they had to cease buying gas from owners

23

that they had no obligation to purchase the gas from.

24

these owners in East Morgantown and Greens Creek field areas

25

of Mississippi, Coastal and others, had chosen not to commit

term contracts in this field were made with Getty, Harkins,

3

Florida Gas, and others by Transeo, of course, there was

In 1978,

'79 and '80, when the long­

a shortage and these particular producers chose not to
commit their gas to contract.

6

All indications were that for the foreseeable

7

future prices were going to continue increasing, oil prices

8

were going up, the market was going to expand, everything

9

look rosy.

10

iX

thought.

There was no need to commit their gas they
I assume they thought that.

They didn't.

11

So, in essence, when the axe dropped and they

12

were no longer able to sell their gas to Transeo at the

13

high prices being received by the contract producers under

14

those 1979 and '80 contracts, they sought relief from the

15

Mississippi Oil & Gas Board pursuant to Rule 48 of the Board

16

which required the ratable taking of gas from the State

17

of Mississippi.

18

that rule.

19

contract gas and to take it without discrimination.

It was a state-wide rule.

The Board enforced

The Board required Transeo to take the non­

20

The impact, the consequence of that order was

21

to displace contract purchasers, because, as we said in

22

the beginning, the market is limited, they cannot take any

23

more than the market could take, so if they are required

24

to take non-contract gas, they have got to cut back on taking

25

some contract gas, the effect of the order.

QUESTION:

What is the effect of that state order,

2

because I am not sure I understand it.

3

to take more gas or simply to spread the payments around

4

for the gas that it did take?

5

MR. GROWER:

Did it require Transeo

The effect of the order, Justice

6

O'Connor, was to increase — take or pay payment for one

7

thing.

8

a certain minimum take.

9

I will explain that.

QUESTION:

In that the contracts required

it would help me understand your response.

12

the payments out to a broader group of people for the gas

it did take?

Did the state

MR. GROWER:

15

require the taking of more gas.

16

effect.

17

is complicated and difficult for me to explain.

18

it is not difficult for '/ou to understand, out these contracts

19

require take or pay which in. essence the cost of making

20

take or pay payments are a flow through to the consumer.

21

It increases the cost.

But, that take or pay may be recouped

22

in a five-year period.

And, if that gas can be recouped,

23

it is only recouped out of the excess above the minimum

24

take.

25

Th; effect of it was to ultimately

So, we are either going to pay for the gas twice

(202) 628-9300

1

if we can't recoup it or when we are catching up and pro­

2

ducing above the minimum we are going to have to produce

3

more gas from that contract while at the same time producing

4

the non-contract gas that the state requires us to take.

5

QUESTION:

Well, right now, I suppose, the court

6

below remanded for a determination of what price ultimately

7

would have to be paid for these other pool owners, so we

8

don't even know what it would cost ultimately, I gather.

9

MR. GROWER:

Your Honor, we know what it would

10

cost from this standpoint.

11

the high-cost contracts — Those contracts at this time

12

were $7.90.

13

take at $7.90, that increased cost increases substantially.

The take or pay payments under

So, when you have to pay for gas you can't

QUESTION:

Well, maybe I misunderstand the order,

15

but I thought that to the extent that the state interfered

16

with your arrangement, it was on behalf of the other owners

17

of the common pool and that the amount to be paid then

18

was not the amount to be paid Getty under the contract —

19

MR. GROWER:

20

QUESTION:

That is right, Your Honor.
— but some reasonable rate based on

21

present or then current market.

22

MR. GROWER:

That is right, Your Honor.

But,

23

Transeo did not want to take this gas at all.

24

could not take this gas without increasing its obligations

25

under its contract.

That is the main problem.

QUESTION:

2

MR. GROWER:

Mr. Grower, what is a take or pay?
Take or pay obligation is — For

3

instance, in these contracts that were made after the NGPA

4

when there was a severe shortage in the pipe lines needed

5

gas supply, under their contract made in that context, they

6

were required to purchase from 85 to 90 percent of the

7

deliverability of those wells and if they did not purchase

8

85 or 90 percent, whichever the figure was in the contract,

9

they would then have to pay — in a particular year, they

10

would then have to pay for the gas not taken in addition

11

to the gas taken.

12

Now, that take or pay gas, it is paid for, then

13

may be recouped within the next five years, but it can only

14

be recouped out of the 10 or 15 percent excess above the

15

85 or 90 percent that is available to recoupment, because

16

you still have the minimum requirement to take 85 or 90

17

percent.

18
19

QUESTION:

So, it can be recouped only by taking

more than 85 percent?
1.

20

MR. GROWER:

Only by taking more than 85 percent.

21

Now, the problem now is that under today's market conditions,

22

where the market cannot take that gas, they are incurring

23

additional take or pay problems that are so severe that

24

there is no way that they can catch up out of that 10 or

25

15 percent.

Well, what are today's market conditions

compared to what they were when this problem arose?

3

MR. GROWER:

Well, it has gotten worse, it has

6

In this case, we are talking about $50 million to $70 million

incurred at that time, a short period of time.

QUESTION:

Well, it is a drop in demard for the

gas?
MR. GROWER:

That is correct.

A serious drop

in demand, I might say.
The propblem is exacerbated by the fact that the

23

more the market drops under the regulatory scheme and the

24

take or pay obligation is incurred and if those costs are

added, you are increasing the cost, you are losing more

Mr. Grower, you may resume

SESSION

The order in this case by the State Oil and Gas
Board of Mississippi requiring the purchase of non-contract

10

gas at any cost directly impacts on the cost of service

11

of the pipe line.

12

Also, the order which requires additional take

13

or pay increases the cost of the gas to the consumer which

14

is a direct impact on the cost of service also.

15

These matters have been condemned by this Court,

16

particularly in Northern Natural versus the State Corporation

QUESTION:

2
3

Well, the Supreme Court of Mississippi

thought it was different though.

4

MR. GROWER:

The difference, Your Honor, today

5

is and the issue raised today is whether or not the Natural

6

Gas Policy Act has changed the jurisdiction so that the

7

state may now enter this field and regulate the interstate

8

pipe line.
QUESTION:

9

Northern Natural said that that regulation

10

was bad because what?

It pre-empted the —
All right.

That is the bottom line,

isn't it?
MR. GROWER:

Right.

The pervasive and comprehensive

18

regulation under the Natural Gas Act and the Natural Gas

19

Policy Act today simply sweeps the field clean.

20

no room left for state regulations.

21

Act didn't change that.

QUESTION:

There is

The Natural Gas Policy

Well, didn't the Natural Gas Policy

Act deregulate for this type of gas that is involved here?

Justice O'Connor, it deregulated —

1

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission take that would conflict

2

with the state's order here?

3

MR. GROWER:

Well, in the first place, it conflicts

4

with — the state order here conflicts with the jurisdiction

5

of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to regulate

6

the cost structures of the pipe line company which —

7
8
9

QUESTION:

Well, this particular gas was taken

out of their regulatory jurisdiction, wasn't it?
MR. GROWER:

The price of the gas at the well

10

head was deregulated, but my point, Your Honor, is that

11

any price that the company is required to purchase this

12

gas affects its cost structures which has been held by this

3

Court on several occasions, and recently in Maryland versus

4

Louisiana and Exxon versus Eagerton, that that regulation

5

of the cost structu :es of the interstate pipe line is the

6

exclusive domain of the FERC.

7

QUESTION:

But, if you are right about that, I

8

would assume that the state's order, even just as applied

9

to intrastate gas purchases, would have the same kind of

20
21

effect and subject the state to the same argument.
MR. GROWER:

Well, intrastate gas is not sold

22

in interstate commerce.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. GROWER:

Well, the NGPA has given the states

2

the right to establish lesser prices for intrastate gas

3

than the maximum price allowed by the NGA.

4

only jurisdiction that has been given and yery well state

5

regulations of intrastate that would conflict with that

6

might be pre-empted.

7

if the Court please, and I have not looked at that point.

8
9

That is the

Of course, that is not the issue here,

QUESTION:

May I ask one question, Mr. Grower.

You have talked a great deal about the take or pay contract.

10

Had your client not entered in any take or pay contract,

11

but had foreseen the economic situation that later developed,

12

would you still contend that the Missouri rule was

13

unconstitutional?

14

MR. GROWER:

The —

15

MR. GROWER:

Mississippi rule, I am sorry.

16
17

Mississippi rule.
MR. GROWER:

Your Honor, yes, because, as I say.

18

the regulation which requires the company to purchase noi>-

19

contract gas at any cost impacts directly on the cost of

20

service of this pipe line.

cost of service that flows through subject to the FERC

22

regulations.

QUESTION:

The price of the gas is a direct

So that then the discussion of the

24

take or pay contract is not really critical to your

25

constitutional argument?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. GROWER:

It is not critical, but it is the

2

point that was the focus in the Northern Natural case, because

3

in the Northern Natural case take or pay was indicated to

4

be one of the problems of conflict that could occur where

5

it increased the price to the consumer and affected the

6

cost of service.

I would like to take some additional time for
rebuttal, if the Court please.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEROME M. FEIT, ESQ.

12

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

13
14

MR. FEIT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

15

This case very squarely raises the pre-emption

16

question as the continuing vitality of Northern Natural.

17

The facts, as Mr. Grower stated, are essentially the same

18

statutory scheme, eitner comply with the state ratable take

19

order and take more gas than it was able to need for its

20

customers or take less gas under its take or pay provisions

21

and incur costs with the ultimate result being, as Northern

22

Natural said, that that could seriously impair the Federal

23

Commission's authority to regulate the intricate relationship

24

between the purchasers' cost structures and eventual cost

25

to wholesale customers.
15
AlDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The question, and the state courts quite clearly

2

recognized, that the decision would go in favor of Transeo

3

in that case if Northern Natural was still good law.

4

divergence, the difference was that Northern Natural, the

5

courts found, was not good law by virtue of their reading

6

of the Natural Gas Policy Act and the Natural Gas Act.

7

Th4

Our reading, on the contrary, is totally to the

8

opposite.

9

Act and the Natural Gas Act that the Northern Natural case

10
11

We believe that both under the Natural Gas Policy

has continuing validity.
Let me turn to the Natural Gas Policy Act.

There

12

are two kinds of things under that statute which I think .

13

indicate the continuing nature of non-state intervention

14

and effective federal control.

15

As you know, this was -- The Act was to set up

16

a nation-wide market in gas because of the problems that

17

had arisen.

18

Policy Act in Title I was statutorily fix che prices,

19

statutorily fix — detail the prices for gas.

20

had any authority under that to fix those prices.

21

And, what Congress did under the Natural Gas

FERC no longer

But, in addition to that kind of scheme — In

22

addition to that, FERC did have specific authority under

23

Title VI of the Natural Gas Policy Act to prohibit the pass

24

through of such gas costs which is found to be the product

25

of fraud, abuse, or similar grounds.
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

So, what you had was just the opposite of a

2

commission of state intervention.

3

under Title I which FERC could not interfere with as you

4

pointed out in the Mid-Louisiana opinion.

5

hand, you had FERC's control to assure that gas costs —

6

that pricing practices of pipe lines are not fraud, abusive,

7

or invalid on similar grounds from passing through.

8

is the Natural —

that states can affect the producers; that is the statute

than it wants, because it affects — It is not only

of FERC is rot that one state provision fails, the concern

MR. FEIT:

Is that what I —

I think if there were no take or pay

it needed for its customers or it was required to take,

concern is the downstream customer.

Before coining to my submission, I would like to

address the question that Your Honor raised about take or

pay payments.

4

payments for gas.

5

the period of a 20-year contract that there will be significant

6

periods of time during which a purchaser will not need

7

all of the gas that the producer can deliver, but at the

8

same time the producer needs some sort of cash flow.

Take or pay payments are refundable pre­
A fundamental assumption is that during

So, if and where and the parties agree, they agree

10

to include a take or pay provision which provides that if

11

you get to the end of a contract year and the pipe line

12

has not taken all of the minimum quantity that it agreed

13

to, it will pre-pay for the balance and it will recover

14

it either in kind or in cash under cash balance.

15

the time the take or pay obligation is called for, they

16

cannot make up the gas, if they are being called to pre-pay

17

for, then they have a contractual defense.

If, at

Now, as interesting as all that is, it has nothing

1b

to do with what the state has required in this case.

20

the exaggerations that have been made about what the State

21

of Mississippi has required and look at pages 14 and 15

22

of our brief and how our Mississippi Supreme Court has

23

construed this requirement.

24
25

The requirement is not that a pipe line has to
take the first MCF of gas.

It is that the pipe line when

and if — this is on 14 and 15 of our brief — when and

2

if a pipe line decides to take gas from a pool, then whatever

3

quantity it wants to take, it must offer to take those

4

quantities ratably as among the different wells in the pool

5

so they are not taking 100 percent out of one well and 10

6

percent out of another one, which is virtually the example

7

we had in this case, and they must offer to pay a market

8

price unless the parties agree otherwise.

9

free to agree to two cents, two dollars, or twenty dollars.

10

The parties are

But, in the absence of that agreement, if somebody

11

wants their gas taken so that no drainage occurs, the state

12

is not going to allow drainage to occur simply because somebody

13

is being obstinate about the price that ought to be paid.

14

They called for a market-responsive orice.

15

And, as we point out in ouc brief, Transeo has

16

been complying with this by offering a market-out clause

18

Now, let me get to the is>ue which is pre-emption.

19

We submit that Under Section 601(a) of the NGPA Congress

20

clearly eliminated FERC's Section 1(b) jurisdiction over

21

wholesales of deregulated natural gas in interstate commerce.

22

Consequently, the states are once again free to

23

attach a reasonable ratable take requirement to any

24

purchaser's takes of deregulated gas.

FERC — it is briefed on page 15 —

concedes that point.

It is a question of implied pre­

Is there some place else where they

MR. TAYLOR:

Yes, sir.

If you go to the last

four pages of the Supreme Court's opinion — I am referring

9

to the Southern citation — if you go to those last four

10

pages in which they are construing the purpose and objective

11

and power of the Oil and Gas Board under Rule 48, it is

12

designed to prevent drainage and to insure fairness of

correlative rights because it is fundamentally unfair for

MR. TAYLOR:

They are part and parcel of the same

MR. TAYLOR:

Waste would seem

But, if you don't —
Do you disagree with that?
I don't disagree with that but you

have got to read the tail end of the opinion in which —

16

First, they consider the constitutional questions, then they

17

move to the legitimate state interest in connection with

18

the commerce clause and there is no way to separate — Waste

is defined under Mississippi law as the non-ratable or dis-

20

In other words, the purpose of the Conservation

That is only drainage as among owners,

not drainage which would result in waste.

non-ratable disproportinate takes of gas.

In 1938, Congress wrote into law this Court's

decision in the Attleboro line of cases which was that

3

because of the commerce clause the states can't regulate

4

these wholesales.
Congress came along and passed the Natural Gas

5

Act, saying because the states can't do it because of the

7

commerce clause, we are going to allow the Federal Power

8

Commission to do it.

9

Ironically, after the Natural Gas Act was passed

10

in 1938, this Court went off and abandoned that line of

11

cases.

12

the Arkansas Electric Cooperative case makes it very clear

13

that the Attleboro test has for all practical purposes been

14

abandoned, the Pike test has been applied.

had been loosened.

at Pike, that is the same test that the Court has applied

that since the NGPA eliminated Section 1(b) jurisdiction

If you apply the commerce clause test to Pike,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ED DAVIS NOBLE, JR., ESQ.

13
14

Mr. Noble?

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEE

10
11

They

MR. NOBLE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
My purpose is to explain what the legitimate state
interest of the State of Mississippi is with its Rule 48.
We believe th it it encourages the development

15

of its natural gas by protecting the correlative interest

16

of each owner, operator, and producer in a particular pool,

17

but more importantly, Rule 48 also satisfies the statutory

18

requirement that the 0.1 and Gas Board at least attempt

19

to conserve the natural gas in the State of Mississippi;

20

that is to prevent drainage as it has been defined by co­

21

counsel, waste and reservoir damage caused by unratable

22
23

and disproportinate withdrawals of gas.
The requirements of Rule 48, in effect, are practical

24

and consistent with the congressional goals of the NGPA.

25

And, in response to Justice O'Connor's question, it encourages

J

1

the participation of all the owners, operators, or producers

2

in a particular field and encourages them to develop the

3

state's natural resources by permitting just compensation

4
5

for their efforts in the development at a fair and current
price.

6

Now, if the primary objective of the NGPA is to

7

increase the supply of natural gas in intrastate, then we

8

say that 48 is consistent with the federal program.

9

is because it corrects what could be a potential market

That

10

failure in the sales of gas at the well head in Mississippi.

11

That can occur when you see a situation which we have and

12

that is very few purchasers in a field where there are multiple

13

owners, operators, and producers, thereby creating a market

14

situation of perhaps less production and lower prices offered

15

than would be in a perfectly competitive market.

16

Further, the producer would be without a purchaser

17

and, therefore, would suffer a risk under the rule of capture

18

which exists in oil and gas and that is he would see his

19

property extracted without compensation, and, therefore,

20

it would conflict with the rule and the law of correlative

21

rights.

22

As this Court is aware, NGPA makes no provision

23

for the protection of the small, independent, non-contracting

24

owners.

25

It does so merely because it provides that if you participate

Well, Rule 48 provides for that such protection.

at least offer, no more than offer, to purchase the gas

at a reasonable or current price.

Now, if —

MR. NOBLE:

11

That is even though there is no contract?
That is if there is no contract, that

Let us assume that that particular owner, operator,
or producer refuses, what can he do?

Then he merely runs

the risk of being able to recover his property; that is
his oil or natural gas that he owns at a later date.

Rule

12

48 merely gives him the opportunity or protection of being

13

able to recover during the purchase time at a fair rate.

14

If the producer is not permitted to purchase and

15

to sell and to get his fair market price at the time in

16

which the pipe line does, in fact, purchase, then there

17

is a possibility that since he will not be compensated,

18

then he would seek other markets in intrastate, thereby

19

defeating the purpose of NGPA by reducing by whatever means

20
21

22
23
24
25

the particular oil and gas which might flow into intrastate.
The State of Mississippi does not mandate taking
by strict allowables or production.

It is that the Oil

and Gas Board sets maximum allowables for a specific period
of time which means that if you do produce in the State
of Mississippi you can take anywhere from the well being

If there is no contract, there is

no take or pay.
QUESTION:

I understand, but could they — Say

4

the market price is $1.00 a thousand cubic feet or whatever

5

it might be, could they just pay a nickel and would that

6

satisfy the —

7

MR. NOBLE:

No, sir.

As the Supreme Court of

8

the State of Mississippi said, at least that person should

9

be assured of a fair market price for his gas.

10

In other words, at least, if the fair market price

11

will not interfere with commerce or will not interfere with

12

FERC — Will not come into play with FERC, because all we

13

are addressing is either market price or fair market price

18

KR. NOBLE:

QUESTION:

20

It did, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.
So, we really don't know what price

will finally be determined by the Mississippi State Court.

21

MR. NOBLE:

22

In allowing for a fair market price and creating

That is correct, sir.

23

a market in interstate commerce, we would also suggest that

24

Rule 48 protects the consumer.

25

the owner, operator, or producer will have its opportunity

That is all it says is that

to be compensated and that there is no incidental hinderance

2

to the market place because if, in fact, the end result

3

of more production, more gas, will, in essence, create a

4

market where there is by supply a lesser price at the well

5

head to be paid by the consumer.

6

I would like to address another question posed

7

by Justice O'Connor and that is what, if anything, would

8

be the standard which might be or could be applied by the

9

State of Mississippi or what should be applied?

10
11

We would suggest that the rule of the State of
Mississippi is a fair one and is constitutional.

12

The import of NGPA is that there at least be a

13

competitive market at the well head and it suggests that

14

the Mississippi ratable take is i policy which is carefully

15

calculated to reflect competitive markets.

16

I would suggest to the Court that this rule or

17

any other rule would be a minimum interference with the

18

participants at the market and ; (articularly so than it would

19

not injure the consumer or the public interest.

you very much.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN MARSHALL GROWER, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT — REBUTTAL

3

MR. GROWER:

There are a number of matters that

4

I would like to address, but I will try to address a few

5

of them.

6

Let's first take the statement that Mississippi

7

has not required Transeo to purchase any gas.

8

of choice is that?

9

take a minimum quantity of gas pursuant to the regulatory

All right.

We have got that gas
That is part

We don't have to buy that gas because

of the State of Mississippi.
QUESTION:

Why should the validity of the state's

ratable take policy turn on the fortuity of whether your

17

company enters into a take or pay contract?

18

MR. GROWER:

Justice O'Connor, the take or pay

20

50 years, since 1938 when the NGA came into effect.

you, to enter into a take or pay contract for this kind

2

of gas by any federal requirement that you do so?
MR. GROWER:

3

Your Honor, that is correct, but

4

at the time these contracts were entered into it was still

5

part of the regulatory scheme recognized by the FERC and

6

they had regulations dealing with the manner in which take

7

or pay, the costs were passed on to the consumer.
QUESTION:

8
9

Well, would the question be different

here if these contracts, these take or pay contracts had

10

been entered after the time that the FERC ceased to require

11

them?

12

MR. GROWER:

Well, if these contracts had no take

13

or pay obligation, then there would be nothing to prevent

14

the pipe line, if they had no minimum take requirements—

15

You also may hav* minimum take requirements which require

16

you to buy a cercain amount of gas or pay for it, period,

17

with no right to ever recoup it.

18

But, :'.f there are no minimum take requirements,

19

there is nothing to prevent the pipe lines from purchasing

20

all of the gas because they don't have to take it.

2

of the extreme prices we have in the market.

QUESTION:

4

MR. GROWER:

Are you trying to answer my question?
Yes, sir, I am.

And, the fact that

5

there could have been contracts without take or pay, I just

6

can't answer that directly, because there are contracts

7

for take or pay and they were a part of the regulatory scheme

8

and if there were no contracts with take or pay, then there

would be nothing to prevent the pipe lines from purchasing

10

this, because it would not increase their cost.

11

My question to you was if there were

12

take or pay contracts voluntarily entered into by the pipe

13

14

Well, yes.

There is not a requirement

Transeo does not determine how much

2

But, as to the amount, that is regulated by the state as

3

to what can legally be produced.

4

It limits how much it can take.

Now, the regulation — ratable take also implies

5

and includes ratable production.

The state can have

6

jurisdiction and regulate production from the wells over

7

the producer and this is what was said in Northern Natural;

8

that you can require the producers to produce ratably and

9

to share the market.

This is the concept, if the Court

12

you are limiting their production to their share of the

the producer is draining.
