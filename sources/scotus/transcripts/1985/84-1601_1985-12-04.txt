The Respondent points out its view

for differing with you on a number of those cases and

suggests thew few remaining ones don't establish a

practice.
NR. OLSON*

5

We respectfully/ of course,

6

disagree, Nr. Justice Rehnquist.

7

the Appellees have attempted to narrow down those cases,

8

but in their efforts to narrow down them present a

9

distinction without a difference.

Those, the cases --

The fact is that questions of construction or

10
11

the questions of the application of that particular

12

statute have been raised in that postjudgment rehearing

13

context.

14

presented over two dozen cases, and in fact, we pointed

15

out to the fact that a number of the cases raised by

16

Appellees themselves involve situations where the courts

17

of Alabama discussed a rule but then went on to rule on

18

the merits.

19

In addition, as we set out in our brief,

we

The fact is that to the extent that there is

20

an articulation from time to time of a rule that issues

21

cannot be raised at that posture of the proceeding, the

22

court has gone on to do so in a regular basis.

24

preclude raising the issues at the time that they were

25

raised in this case.

There is

Before moving on to some cf the issues in this

1

2

case, I would like to briefly just emphasize, and

3

because the facts are somewhat ccaplxcated, I will not

4

have an opportunity with the time available to discuss

5

all of the facts, we accept as we must the facts which

6

are set forth in the record oefore this Court and as

aeticulated by

discussion of the facts, to recite or call to the

the Alabama Supreme Court.

I simply

unless the Court would prefer a longer

10

Court's attention two particular aspects of the facts as

11

set forth in the Alabama Supreme Court.

12

First of all, those facts as set forth by the

13

Alabama Supreme Court opinion were edited, selected and

14

set to music, as it were, by Justice Embry, the Justice

15

cf the Alabama Supreme Court whose conduct is called

16

into guestion here so that while we do not dispute, as

17

we cannot, the facts in that case, the emphasis, the

18

characterization of the facts, is due

19

must be considered in light of the circumstances that

20

was written by Justice Embry.

to the fact or

Well, of course, other people

That is correct, and we are not

24

disputing the fact that other people joined his opinion

with respect to the holding of the Alabama Supreme

1

Court, but that the characterization of those facts in

2

that case must be understood in the context that they

3

were written by the Justice who, as we have

4

demonstrated, had a very strong interest in the outcome

5

of the case.

6

Nell, you don't really know.

He

may have — he may have started out with a completely

8

different opinion and other people said please change it.

of the material before the Court —

And then sometime shortly before

18

the final decision, that opinion became the majority

19

opinion of the Court.

Well, it may have because he

changed it.
HR. OLSON*

22

I suppose that inference is

23

possible.

The inference which is quite strcng from

24

reading that transcript of the deposition is that that

25

is not what happened.

Another aspect of that facts —

In any event, it was five to four,

wasn *t it ?
HR. GISON s

I'he decision was five to four,

yes, Justice Blackmun.

5

The other aspect of the facts of the case

6

which it seems to me are important for the Court to

7

understand as it considers this case is that while the

8

Alabama Supreme Court, the jury in Alabama and the

9

Alabama Supreme Court reached a conclusion that there

10

had been a bad faith failure to pay an insurance claim

11

in this case, it was not the policies of Appellant that

12

brought about that conclusionv it was deviation,

13

unauthorized deviations from those policies that led to

14

the conclusion that there had been bad faith failure to

15

pay jn insurance claim.

16

I would like to speak --

17

QUESTION!

Well, was this the first, case in

18

whic.i the Alabama Supreme Court had laid down the

19

pri iciple it followed here?

20

HR. OLSON*

Well, that question is complicated

21

because there are several principles that are

22

articulated here, Justice Erennan

23

Court had first accepted the doctrine that there could

24

be a tort claim and a claim for punitive damages for bad

25

faith in 1981.

The decision in this case follows the precedents

in the decision of the Alabama

As the Court is aware,

the major issue in this

8

case is the question of punitive damages and the extent

9

to which this Court under the Constitution of the United

10

States has the power to limit under the Eighth Amendment

particularly, and also under the due process clause of

12

the Fourteenth Amendment the power to limit punitive

damages.

some of the characteristics of punitive damages which

17

have been pointed out and, I believe, agreed tc by this

18

Court, in various opinions of thj.s Court virtually

without dissent.

20

Before I discuss the constitutional

I would like to go over

One of the characteristics of punitive damages

21

which is most important to this discussion is that —

22

and this is in the words of Justice Marshall in

23

dissenting in the Rosenbloom v. vetroraedia case, but the

24

same language has been picked up by other — in other

25

opinions of this Court,

Well, was that the substance of the

ME. OLSON*

The substance of the charge to the

12

jury in this case -- and there’s a reference in our

13

rep1y brief to

14

record — is that punitive damages were for the purpose

15

of punishment and deterrence

16

to say that punitive damages are primarily in the

discretion of the jury and then concluded that very

10

the subject was guite fleeting and

There are very

are totally discretionary.

11

Another characteristic of punitive damages

12

which has been mentioned by this Court is that while

13

they serve the criminal law function,

14

in amounts generally far higher than crimes for

15

comparable criminal conduct, and I might add that the

16

English courts have particularly made this point and

17

focused on it as well that while we decide that certain

18

conduct is sufficiently reprehensible that it must be

19

subject to standards adopted by the legislature and

20

punishments adopted by the legislature, in the area of

21

punitive damages without the benefit of legislative

22

standards and without the benefit of clear standards

23

with respect to the amount of the award,

24

damages, and for less reprehensible conduct, at least

2

higher and we award punitive damages without any of the

3

protections which we afford tc tne more reprehensible

4

crimes that we treat in our courts.
The fifth characteristic — I've mentioned

four that are generally applicable to punitive damages

7

across the board.

8

there is peculiar to this case, although not necessarily

9

exclusive to this case,

The fifth characteristic is that here

it is here that the punitive

10

damages were awarded for violating a standard net

11

created until four years after the conduct which was

12

being judged by the punitive damages.

13

the traditional notions of due process to punish conduct

14

which does not violate a known standard, and yet in this

15

case punitive damages were awarded for a standard wbich

That is correct, with respect tc

21

the discussion generally of the characteristic of

MR. OLSON;

of course.

I think, that that can be — yes,

I think that that footnote in that Exxon

1C

case can he explained by the fact thac the preemption

11

issue, which was the issue which was being considered in

12

connection with that footnote, was something which had

13

not been briefed and fully developed in the record in

14

the Alabama courts below, so there is a separate

15

prudential reason for this Court not to consider it.
And we looked through the briefs in that case

16
17

to see whether the litigants had actually briefed the

18

Alabama practice prior to the decision in that case that

Contrary to Aetna’s argument that it had no

notice of the substantive conduct which it was expected

to adhere to, Alabama has held for many, many years that

11

insurers have a fiiuoiiry duty with respect to their

insured, so that substantive conduct, good faith towards

towards the insured was already a duty.

14

that was added in 1981 was a tort action to recover for
