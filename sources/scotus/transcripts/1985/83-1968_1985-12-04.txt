none of these counties is a Section 5 county.

of our 100 counties are so covered.

5

Attorney General required the creation of numerous

single member legislative districts in these counties,

implemented when those suggestions were made.

hr. Attorney General, I gather you

suggest you are entitled to an outright reversal, not

Yes, Your Honor.

We would of

course appreciate a reversal with an interpretation of

the statute and how to apply it, and in these

25

multi-member districts,

of course, we would then

continue with the multi-aerober legislative delegations

2

as they existed.

3

North Carolina has historically placed a

4

tremendous amount, of importance in our counties and

5

county lines and so on,

6

of fact, and that was the primary basis on which these

7

various districts were drawn and it has no foundation in

8

racial tainted motivation of any kind, the district

9

courts have,

10

QUESTION;

since Colonial times as a matter

If there was an outright reversal,

11

then the Legislature would have to start all ever again,

12

would they?

13

MR. THORNBURG;

They would -- 1 believe, if

14

Your Honor please, maybe my colleagues to ni y left can

15

verify it, but I think the General Assembly in the last

16

session passed a statute which said that if the case is

17

reversed it simply goes back in these districts, these

18

five districts that are under consideration to the

19

multi-member legislative districts.

20

We are a large and not a homogeneous state in

21

the State of North Carolina, and we feel that each of

22

these districts must be viewed individually and

23

evaluated individually under any statute, according to

24

the particular characteristics that they exhibit.

25

QUESTION;

What is the major error,

you think

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

HR. THORNBURG:

We think the district court

simply ignored the facts in the case.
QUESTION:

I know, but what's the principal

way it did that?
MR. THORNBURG:

By ignoring access to the

8

political process which

9

show, it's just a fundamental error, Your Honor.

we contend exists, and the facts

When you look at the facts and apply the law

as written by Congress,

support the decision that the district court made.

QUESTION:

They went through district by

23

and another.

ME. THORNBURG:

That sort of thing,

that the court found ace based on the record, but when

3

you apply the law to those facts then you don't come out

4

with the result that district court did..

5

QUESTIONi

Is that because -- your basic

6

point, as I understand it, is if the net result of all

7

the voting is something that roughly equals proportional

8

representation, then as a matter of law there can't be a

violation of the statute?

MR. FRIED;

The court below certainly

addressed each district, but the court below also seemed

4

to be very impressed with overall statistics in the

5

State of North Carolina and we think may have been

6

misled by its attention to those overall --

QUESTION*

It should have focused on electoral

8

success of black caniiiat.es in each district over a

period of time?

10

MR. FRIED*

If I may, lour Honor, I would say

11

electoral opportunity as evidenced by very great

12

electoral success over time.

13

that the congressional standard, the White v. Register

14

standard, if you will, was met as a matter cf law in

15

three of those five iistricts is that in all of those

16

districts over a protracted period of time, in a couple

17

of them over nearly a decade, black representatives

18

equaled or exceeded the percentage of black citizens in

19

the population.

20

Now, the reason we say

Nor was this black success achieved by

21

contrivance or through sufferance of the majority, hut

22

if you like, in the old fashioned way through politics,

23

through participation in party politics, in some cases

by blacks serving as chairmen of the local majority

HR. FRIED;

We were addressing the harder

is made out, which is the population.

8

whether that registration was in some sense unfairly

which seemed so dear to the heart of the appellees and

14

the district court, if the multi-member district had

15

been broken up into single member districts,

16

would have been not an increase in black opportunity and

17

participation but a decrease, since the number of

18

representatives, black representatives would have been

19

the same.

20

Yet,

But the thing we

the black citizens living outside of the

21

favored super-majority single-member districts would

have been, on the district court's hypothesis voting

patterns, deprived of an opportunity which they

manifestly enjoyed under the State's previous

25

multi-district system.

Is there any evidence in this case

On the contrary, Your Honor.

The

assiduous efforts to remove such barriers.

What the Solicitor

General and the State have done is, they have taken the

11

first step and said, that's the court's definition for

12

severe polarized voting.

13

I ask you to just look at the district court's

14

opinion, and you'll see how the State and the Solicitor

15

General have misread that opinion, because after looking

16

at whether blacks and whites vote differently, the court,

17

then looked at basically three other things.

Historically, over 81 percent of whites have

refused or failed to vote for black candidates in the

primaries.

As you see here, the representatives

QUESTION*

And that's

I was wondering if you were making

the point -- it just occurs to me that perhaps if you

had single member districts instead of multi-member,

3

maybe you'd have the same number of blacks but they

4

might be different blacks?

5

MR. CHAMBERS*

That is possible, Ycur Honor.

6

What we are talking about, though, is the ability of

7

blacks to relate to their representatives,

8

that, those representatives are accountable for the way

9

that they represent the interests of blacks.

20

to insure

Where they live outside the district, they

first of all are not accessible, and where blacks have

22

to depend on white votes to elect representatives,

again, looking at the totality of the circumstances,

that the district court looked at very intensely to

determine whether vote dilution in fact occurred.

5

Also, if you look — the Defendants asked the

Court to not apply Rule 52 in this particular instance.

I think that Rule 52 controls the determinaticn here,

the fact, we have three native North Carolinians who sat

on this case.

First if we look at

They knew the facts in North Carolina.

Prior to their appointment to the bench they

had actively participated in politics in North

14

And then they looked very closely at whether there was a

real opportunity for blacks to participate in each

Fven in House District 23, where a black was

22

elected since 1973, blacks had to make sure that the

candidate running was someone who could appeal to white

24

residents because white votes were necessary for the

black to be elected.

It was not possible for blacks to
