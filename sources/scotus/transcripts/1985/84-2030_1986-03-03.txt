ORAL ARGUMENT OF MACDONALD FLINN, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT
ME. FLINSi

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, this is an appeal from a judgment by

11

the New York State Court of Appeals.

12

that the lowest price liquor affirmation requirement of

13

New York's alcoholic beveraga control law does not

14

violate the commerce clause of the U.S. Constitution.

15

That court held

On this appeal, Brown-Forman argued that the

16

statute is unconstitutional upon its face because its

17

necessary effect is the extraterritorial regulation by

18

New York of liquor prices in ether states.

19

effectively sets the minimum price for liquor sales in

20

every state in the Union.

21

The New York statute —

QUESTION:

It really Icasn't say what the

prices have to be in some other state.
MS. FLINNi

New lark does not set the price.

7

That is conceded, Justice White.

The supplier initially

8

determines his own price for each brand which he offers

9

for sale to ‘lew fork suppliers.

It is at that point

10

that the New York statite reaches in and obligates him,

11

mandates that he not for an extended period of time, the

12

posting period, charge any lower price in any other

13

state, having filed that price in New York.

14

The statute works this way.

Cn the 25th of

15

every month, every sjpolier must file or post a schedule

16

of prices to be charged for all of us products sold to

17

tc New York wholesalers, the New York statute, as

3

Justice White indicated, obligates every supplier to

4

adhere to that price once posted in New York during the

5

entire calendar month that is covered by the posting

6

requirement.
Every month every supplier must go through

7

8

this affirmation process again.

The language of the

9

statute and the affirmation or verification form

10

employed by the state liquor authority are essentially

11

in the same identical language.

12

indulge me for a moment, I would like to read the

13

explicit salient provisions of the statute.
It required

that the Sew York posted price

must be no higher than the lowest price at which each

16

item of liquor will be sold anywhere in any other state

17

at any time during the calendar month for which such,

18

schedule shall be in effect.
QUESTION;

19

Do you think that is really a

20

promise?

When you file, you promise new to lower your

prices in any other state?

what are the implications of that?

First, unlike the present prospective statute that

10

requires a commitment, a promise, an obligation on the

11

part of the supplier as to tying his hands every place

12

else for a successive month, the original statute merely

13

reflected prices that had in fact already been charged

elsewhere in

basis for a different result

today, even on a facial challenge, would be this.

10

that Beown-Forman's position is representative of the

views or attitudes of all the suppliers.
