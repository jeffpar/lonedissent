MR. LARKINs

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, this case is here cn a writ of

QUESTION;

But it could do tcth .

3

MB. LARKIN:

Correct.

It could decide that in

4

an individual case it should prosecute under the general

5

adulteration standard, Section 402, or alternatively it

6

could decide to adopt tolerances, regulations that would

7

set precise levels of forbidden contamination, and that

8

would lead to a different type cf proof in ccurt in an

9

individual case.
QUESTION;

10

But if it did the latter, adopt the

11

tolerances, it couldn't proceed in order to -- it

12

couldn't in a specific case insist on a lower

13

tolera nee ?
MR. LARKIN;

14

That's correct.

By saying that

15

they cculd cheese between the two, I mean that they

16

can't as a policy matter decide how to proceed to

17

protect the public health.

18

they cannot then proceed under the general adulteration

19

standard.

20
21

QUESTION:

But pending the setting cf a

tolerance, they could proceed on a case-by-case basis?

HR. LARKIN;

1

Well, it is more than just a

2

policy statement, Your Honor, because the action levels

3

represent the agency’s judgment based on the available

4

scientific data as to what level cf contamination will

5

result in adulteration, so the action levels also

6

represent the agency’s judgment as to what it can prove

in an individual case will result in adulteration.

Well, that may be, but legally they

There are at least eight

substances that the FDA has action levels for at

substances, because the different substances may be

And if you went at it by the

business of setting tolerances, you would have had tc

15

MR. IARKIN*

Be believe that we would have tc

at least set that many different tolerances, and for

substances for which we do net yet knew, every time a

Yes, but meanwhile, while you were

setting them, you could have your action level.

benefitted by virtue of having tolerances in effect.

HR. IARKIN;

2

Yes, the eight action levels deal

with substances that are either necessary or

unavoidable.

6

HR. 1ARKIN;

The four reasons are as follows.

Eirst, the FDA's construction of the Act is eminently

8

rational and entirely plausible.

9

the text and overall structure cf the Act, with the

10

legislative history, and the *38 Act and subsequent

amendments, and with the policies that Congress sought

12

to implement through the statute.

HR. LARKIN;

It is consistent with

clause in one section cf a multipart statute.

By sc

2

doing, the Court of Appeals effectively misunderstood

3

the function that Congress intended Section 406 to

4

serve.
Third, Congress has been made aware of the

5
6

agency's construction and the agency's regulatory

7

position, and Congress has never criticized the agency

8

for the practice it has followed, and in fact in

9

Congress relied on the agency's views when Congress

adopted an amendment tc the Act.
Fourth, neither the Court cf Appeals nor the

11
12

respondents have offered a sound reason why Congress

would have intended the regulatory process tc be

should be restructured in a new fashion at this late

date.

18

suggest would not materially benefit the public, and

would in fact pose substantial risks that the FDA would

historically seen best.

In fact, as we explained, restructuring the

I suppose in the process you will

explain:why Congress thought -- ever required

tolerances, or ever provided for them.

because the agency believed that the ability tc adept

2

legislative rules would enhance its ability to protect

3

the public health .

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. IARKIN:

And you decided otherwise later.
No, the agency with the initial

6

problem cf dealing with pesticides adopted a pesticide

7

tolerance in

1944.

In 1954, there was no longer any

/

8

need to proceed under Section 406 because the pesticide

9

amendment provided a new and speedier procedure to adopt

10

tolerances.

11

we are concerned today are unavoidable contaminants that

12

for the most part were not discovered until beginning in

13

the 1960s, when aflatoxin, for example, was discovered.

having tolerances adopted in every case dc net

materially advance its ability to prctect the public

health, and on the other hand there is a substantial

20

risk that once a tolerance is set, the agency might net

21

be able to respond quickly in order to prctect the

public health if there are new developments.

reading>cf the statute, we believe, is narrow.

10

Now, the central issue in this case is what

11

function did Congress intend Section 406 to serve.

12

that function is understood, we believe that it becomes

13

manifest that the agency’s construction of the statute

14

is correct, and that the agency has been correctly

15

applying the Act for the nearly 50-year period it has-

16

been in existence.

17

lihen

The pivotal provision in this regard is

18

Section 406.

which was not the initial Act that was adopted to

20

protect the public health.

23

24

in an individual case that the presence of a contaminant

25

in the food may render it injurious to health.

Section 406 was added in the 1938 Act,

That:vas the

19C6 Act.

The only way the agency

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

That was

1

the precise holding that this Court handed down in the

2

Lexington Mill case.

3

Now, that was a valuable construction cf the

4

statute for the agency, because the agency did net have

5

to prove that it would necessarily injure the public in

6

every case.

7

its enforcement powers could be enhanced by gaining the

8

ability to adept legislative rules that would allow it

9

to set precise levels cf contaminaticn.

Eut nonetheless, the agency believed that

10

In the

1933 version of the Act which was

11

drafted by the agency, the agency sought approval to

12

adopt the legislative rules known as tolerance.

13

agency did so because it believed that in seme cases,

14

the case-by-case method could be superseded by

15

regulation.

the current version of Section 406, tut the agency

2

construed the statute as teing discretionary, not

3

mandatory.

4
5

QUESTION;

its face, you:vould think that shall meant something.

6
7

I must say, if you jest read it cn

HR. IARKIN;

We believe that the vert "shall"

has to be read in conjunction with the phrase, "to such
/

8

extent as he finds necessary to protect the public

9

health."

When that is read as a whole, we believe it

10

allows the Secretary the discretion to decide whether it

11

is necessary to protect the

12

tolerances, that the verb "shall" can't be isolated from

13

that following phrase simply because there are a few

14

other.words that intervene in the statute, and that is

15

amply demonstrated, we believe, by the legislative

16

history.

17

yet at the same time, even though it contained the same

18

verb, the FDA construed it as being discretionary.

As

MR. IARKIN:

Let me turn to the statute then

so that I can explain ;why we believe the Court of

Appeals for reading Section 406 as mandatory is that it

believed that in the absence of the tolerance, food

QUESTION:

I knew you said that abcut the

Court*cf Appeals opinion.

14

MR. LARKINs

We think that at three different

15

places the Court of Appeals makes that position clear..

16

For example, at Page 4A, the first full paragraph, the

17

second sentence, beginning,

18

Appeals says, "Section 342 would, except for the saving

19

grace of Section 346, define any aflatoxin-tainted corn

banned from interstate commerce."

"Hence," the Court of

MR. IARKIN;

It would, if the contaminant were

10

an amount below the tolerance, but the second half of

that sentence doesn’t follow from the first.

12

QUESTION;

Oh, okay.

13

MR. IARKIN;

The existence of the regulation

14

would allow the food to be shipped in interstate

15

commerce if it contained less than the tolerance level,

16

hut you don’t need to establish the tolerance in order

17

to exempt a contaminated food from being adulterated.

18

The tolerances operate in the ether sense.

19

The Court of Appeals believed that you had to

20

adopt tolerances because they were the only:way of

21

rendering a food unadulterated, and we think the statute

22

doesn’t reach that far.

policy issues concerning the process to be used by the

24
25

And before I proceed I would like to say I

(202) 628-9300

1

immediately apparent that aflatoxin would be added, but

2

it is very clear in the legislative history that Gcngres

3

intended to ccver substances added by nature as well as

4

those added by man, and the FDA, as Mr. Larkin said,

5

consistently construed that word in that way.
For example, the legislative history talks

6
7

about lead, which can get into the environment, and

8

describes that as an added substance.
The substances that we are concerned with here

9

10

are substances such as mercury in fish and aflatoxin in

11

corn, the specific substance around which this case

12

arose.

13

Justice White's question, which is, why would Congress

14

have wanted to intend, wished to intend that FDA use the

15

public participation and rulemaking processes in

16

regulating these added poisonous and deleterious

17

substances?

And I would like to begin by responding to

18

And to start, I would like to talk for a few

19

minutes, one minute about what decision it is that the

20

FDA is going to have to make when it is regulating

21

aflatoxin or another one of these substances.

22

Essentially it is a two-part decision.

23

instance it will have to look at the evidence and

24

determine how dangerous is that substance.

25

In the first

The parties here agree that aflatoxin is an

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

extremely potent carcinogen, but cbvicusly cne of the

2

issues that the agency would have to look at is exactly

3

hew potent.

4

The second issue is how avoidable.

Aflatoxin occurs in a mold that grows on corn,

5

but the mold can be controlled by dampness or ether

6

storage conditions, and so the agency would want to lock

7

obviously and see whether there were ways tc limit the

8

public exposure to the substance, and regardless of

9

whether the FDA uses the action levels which it chooses

/

10

tc use or the rulemaking procedure we are advocating, it

11

is going to have to decide each of these twe issues.

12

The difference is

that public participatlcn

13

would require the agency to do several things that we

14

regard as advantageous.

15

marshall the evidence and inform the public of what

16

evidence it is relying on.

17

allow the submission of additional evidence by either

18

consumers or by industry.

19

First, it would have to

Secondly, it would have to

Third, it would have to hold a hearing if

20

someone requested a hearing

21

issues of fact, and fourth, it would have tc explain the

22

reasons for its decision and put them together in a

23

record which

24
25

and if there were material

would be subject tc judicial review.

The advantages of such a system are that it
disciplines the agency in its thought process, it allows

12

The issue is "whether in Section 406 Congress mandated

13

14

to do before I get to the issue is spend a few minutes

15

talking about action levels, which are the way, the

Three times in recent years the FEA has

nature, and at most what the FDA has done to provide for

public comment is after the fact publish its decision in

9

the Federal Register and invite comments.

In 1983, the

10

Community Nutrition Institute did indeed comment, tut

11

the FDA never even responded .
It is our contention that these action levels

12
13

in most respects operate like a tolerance even though

14

they are not promulgated through the tolerance setting

15

procedures, and they do that because we would contend,

16

they act really as a license to the industry, and they

17

are the FDA’s approval of corn, for example, as long as

18

it contains less than 20 parts per billion aflatcxin,

19

and I would like to take a moment and cite a couple cf

20

the places in the record to demonstrate this, because it

21

has just recently become an issue in the case.
The first place is in the answer to the

them sufficient flexibility to act when they need it,

and essentially if the FDA had a tolerance here and

14

there and there were an emergency, they could reduce the

tolerance on an expedited basis, and indeed in Section

advantages of a tolerance is that once you go through

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEE
MR. LARKIN;

19

20

Yes, Your Honor.

I have a few

points I would like to make.
First, we have heard a great deal about public

21
22

participation being the purpose that the Act:was

23

adopted.

24

that the FDA:will receive comments from parties either

25

asking to have tolerances or action levels set or

As a factual matter, I would like to point out

changed, and therefore if respondents want tc have seme

2

input in the process they need only apply tc the agency.

3

But I think, more importantly, since the

4

question is what Congress intended in 1938, and since

5

the legislative history makes crystal clear that the

6

public Congress was concerned with were the people who

7

produce food at that point, I don't think respondents

8

can reasonably expect to place a contemporary

9

construction cn a rather old statute.

/

10

Secondly, respondents argue that action levels

11

are the equivalent of a license tc add contaminants tc

12

food or to market contaminated food, and that is just

13

flat wrong.

14

guidelines, and tolerances are regulations having the

15

force and effect of law.

16

different, and respondents have attempted tc equate the

17

two throughout this case.

18

Action levels are informal prosecutorial

The two are materially

I would also like to point out that as we

19

explained at Page 45, Note 45 cf cur brief, it is net

20

that easy to change tolerances.

I would also like to say that respondents have

16

1977, so anyone can learn where they are, and the last

17

point is that we don’t ask the Court to say that the

18

House amendment to the bill had nc meaning.

19

have to do is read the House report, and you can see

20

that the House stated quite clearly that it didn’t
