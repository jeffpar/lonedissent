MR. NODES*

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, defendant in this case is in

2

violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.

3

motion was well beyond the time limits allowed by New

4

Jersey court rules, and in fact was one year beyond that

5

time limit, and since defendant was unable to

demonstrate gcod cause for this procedural default, the

trial judge did not entertain the motion.

Since this

New Jersey’s appellate courts affirmed this

MH. CONSTANTINE*

Hr. Nodes, was there ever

any evidentiary hearing in the trial court as to the

13

circumstances surrounding the seizure and that sort of

14

thing ?

15

MR. NODES*

No, Your Hono;. , there was not.

QUESTION!

How was this case tried in state

court?
MR. NODES;

This was a bench trial.

It was a

8

bench trial at defendant’s specific request.

9

trial judge sat as the finder of fact in this case.

10

QUESTION;

So the

Did the trial judge in effect make

11

a finding# or at least expressed in some way the

12

harmless error —

13

MR. NODES;

Yes, we believe he did# in two

14

different ways.

15

the trial, prior to giving his verdict, he expressed his

16

observations of the case and gave his reasons for

17

reaching his verdict.

18

credibility of the defense witnesses and the prosecution

19

witnesses, and obviously found the main witness, the

20

victim, to be the most credible.

21

Firstly, at trial, at the conclusion of

At that time he spoke only of the

More importantly, at a bail hearing following

22

the trial at which the trial judge was required to

23

determine whether or not there was any good cause for

24

appeal or any issue on which defendant could prevail, he

25

was confronted with the issue concerning the bed

sheet,

1

and he ruled that this bed sheet evidence was only one

2

small part of the whole case.

3

Clearly, if he did not believe that this error

4

was harmless, Knowing that a supression issue, a Sixth

5

Amendment and a suppression issue were to be litigated

6

before the appellate courts, he would have to have ruled

7

that there was a possibility of success on appeal.

sail that there wasn’t because the —

QUESTIONS

He

Would you say that he characterized

that evidence as cumulative?
MR. NODESs

Ch, I believe that this evidence

was either cumulative or in some parts not —
QUESTION*

Did the trial judge characterize it

in essentially that way?
MR. NODESs

He compared.

I don't know that he

16

used the term cumulative.

17

such as the semen stain found on the bed sheet with the

18

semen stain that was found on the victim's underwear.

19

QUESTIONS

He did compare the evidence

Didn't somewhere, at some point, he

20

express the view that without that evidence he would

21

have reached the same conclusion?

22

MR. NODESt

Yes, he did state, I think, fairly

23

clearly at the bail hearing after stating that the bed

24

sheet evidence was only one small part of the whole

25

case, he did stats that tha main evidence in the case

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

was the credibility evidence, and the bedsheet had

2

little importance.

3

ruling that the bad sheet evidence was cumulative

4

I believe that it is clear from his

evidence, and that that was his feeling, and I believe

5

that that is demonstrated also by his findings at the

6

end of trial, and of course we realize he was not

7

required to make those findings, but he did at some

8

length explain the reasons for his decision, and the

9

reasons for his decision were based almost totally on

10

the credibility of the witnesses.

11

defendant's witnesses to be uncredible and the victim in

12

this case credible.

13

He simply found

So, introduction of this evidence, we suggest,

14

was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

15

that the judge erred in reaching the Fourth Amendment

16

claim because by reaching the merits of this claim, he

17

violated this Court's mandate in Stone versus Powell.

18

Stone, of course, precludes federal habeas corpus

19

litigation in situations in which defendant has had full

20

and fair opportunity to litigate a Fourth Amendment

21

issue before the state courts.

22

Se do believe

The New Jersey court rules provide such an

23

opportunity to every criminal defendant.

24

District Court on habeas corpus in this matter found

25

that petitioners' petition for habeas corpus did not

In fact, the

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

even allege that he was denied a fall and fair

2

opportunity tc litigate his Fourth Amendment claim, and

3

the District Court at habeas corpus in his opinion

4

stated that if such a contention had been made, it would

5

have been totally without basis in fact.

6

To allow defendants to avoid the reasoning

7

behind Stone v. Powell by phrasing their claim in Sixth

8

Amendment terms rather than Fourth Amendment terms does

9

violence to the reasoning behind that opinion, and will

10

eliminate the benefits of finality and comity which that

11

opinion was intended to enhance.

12

Stone v. Powell is based on the premise that

13

deterrence is the reason for the exclusionary rule, and

14

that if states provide an opportunity to litigate Fourth

15

Amendment claims in the state courts, the deterrent

16

potential of the exclusionary rule will be fully

17

realized.

18

inter.ded to provide a personal benefit to criminal

19

defendants, but to discourage police misconduct.

20

The exclusionary rule, of course, is not

Therefore, defendants whose suppression

21

motions are denied cannot claim that they have been

22

denied a personal right, but only that society has not

23

received whatever deterrent effect suppression in their

24

case might have cost.
■A

25

This Court found in Stone versus Powell that

(202) 628-9300

1

the incremental benefits of applying Fourth Amendment

2

law and exclusionary rule law on habeas corpus would be

3

small.

4

suppression due to the ineffective assistance of counsel

5

can really only clain

6

certain minor benefits which they might have received

7

had the counsel acted differently.

8
9

Thus a defendant who claims that he was denied

that society has been denied

He still stands convicted on the basis of
highly reliable evidence, and as in this case, rarely is

10

evidence which is found to have been obtained in

11

violation of the Fourth Amendment found to be

12

unreliable, and there will be very little chance of an

13

unjust conviction.

14

Claims of this type are really Fourth

15

Amendment claims even though raised under the Sixth

16

Amendment, and should be treated as such.

17

should no more be allowed to raise Fourth Amendment

18

claims under the Sixth Amendment than they are under the

19

Fourth Amendment.

20

He

Defendant

suggest that this is particularly true in

21

cases such as this in which the attorney error, if any,

22

amounts to a procedural default of a reasonable state

23

rule.

24

miscalculation concerning the law or the facts does net

25

constitute cause under the first crime of Wainwright v.

In other situations,

Sykes

2

In a number of cases, including Heed v. Ross,

3

this Court has noted that the criminal trial process is

4

extremely complex, and il the system is to run

5

efficiently so that just results can be reached in

6

criminal trials, it is necessary that the states enact

7

and enforce a series of rules and procedures.

8
9

Of course, if these rules are violated, it
will nearly always be an attorney who is responsible for

10

the violation.

11

He is the one who makes motions in cases.

12

almost always be responsible.

13

He is the one who makes the objections.
Fe will

If a criminal defendant is allowed to excuse

14

the violation of a procedure or a rule simply by

15

claiming that the attorney has made the error, or

16

attorney responsibility, there will be no way to enforce

17

the rules since on habeas corpus a defendant who makes

18

that typ« of claim in state court and does not prevail

19

because the state court holds its own rules, will be

20

able to claim a due process violation, and in doing so,

21

if successful, will be able to effectively enforce

22

noncompliance with the court rules.

23

If this were allowed, we believe that the

24

court rrles would become meaningless because there would

25

really be no way to enforce them in a meanirigful way.

16

MR. NODES*

I don't know the reasons why a

2

main reasons why suppression motions are normally held

3

before trial and why in New Jersey the requirement is

that a suppression motion be made within 30 days of the

reguire the effect that state courts be unable to

10

enforce their procedural rules, and we believe that this

11

is one of the primary reasons behind decisions such as

12

Wainwright v. Sykes and such as Engle v.

13

Isaac.

In Engle v. Isaac, for instance, it was clear

14

that the attorney had failed to make an objection, and

15

he failed to nake an objection on the basis cf a rule

16

which many, if not most attorneys would have known about

17

at the time when the objection was required.

18

Still, his failure no, to make that objection

19

did not constitute good cause under Wainwright v.

20

Sykes.

21

assumes attorney error, but still requires that a

22

showing of cause be made in order to justify procedural

23

defaults.

24
25

In effect, the Wainwright v. Sykes line of cases

Attorney error in these cases, the rule, not
the exceptioif, that is the way the case gets to the

If it were not the rule that

situation, we suggest that the cause rule in Wainwright

QUESTION!

Let me also ask you another

7

question, because I may not have the case properly in

mind.

9

just made a mistake on this particular claim, or is it

Is this a case in which the attorney error, he

10

assumed that he was ineffective in his total

11

responsibility to his client?
HR. NODES*

12

There is absolutely no inference

13

whatsoever that he was ineffective in any respect except

14

in failing to make the exclusionary motion.
QUESTION!

15

Is it not correct that the lower

16

courts treated it as though the ineffectiveness in this

17

regard was so serious that it violated the Sixth

18

Amendment.

19

20
21

It wasn’t just — or am I wrong?
HR. NODES:

They treated this one error as if

it were a Sixth Amendment violation.
QUESTION!

And your position is that even if

22

it. were a Sixth Amendment violation, and I suppose even

23

if his total representation was ineffective, that still

24

he can’t raise this point.

25

Hr/’ NODES:

No.

Is that right?
We don’t say that if his
14

throughout the trial were ineffective, this might be one

4

of many points that would be raised or freely

5

considered.

6

If his entire representation

Supposing there were twc things he

did wrong instead of one, and he sail, putting those two

8

together, it violates the Sixth Amendment.

9

things was the Fourth Amendment omission.

10
11

One of the
Could he do

it that way?
MR. NODES*

I think that the Court could

12

consider the effect of the other violation, the

13

Wainwright type violation in considering whether his

14

representation throughout the trial was effective, but

15

that would be only one part of the inquiry, and standing

16

alone it would not normally —

17

QUESTIONS

What you are saying is, if the only

18

evidence of ineffectiveness, no matter how serious and

19

gross it may have been, if it all relates to the Fourth

20

Amendment claim, it is barred by Stone against Powell.

21

MR . NODES*

MR. NODES*

against the defendant.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

Powell —

3

QUESTION^

Under Stone v.

Do you think that is the only

4

evidence and the attorney fails to move for its

5

exclusion when grounds exist to exclude it that that

6

would never amount to ineffective assistance of counsel

7

under the performance standard cf Strickland?
HR. NODESs

8
9

I think that if the courts were

willing to make the inquiry, the performance standard cf

10

Strickland might be found to meet it.

11

suggest is that in the Fourth Amendment area this

12

inquiry should not be made,

13

would lose most of its effect if such an inquiry is

14

made.

15

What I would

or that Stone v. Powell

Stone v. Powell assumes, as most cases do,

16

that most Fourth Amendment evidence is highly reliable

17

and that, there will not be an unjust result because of

18

the admission of this reliable evidence,

19

Powell relies on the state courts to make determinations

20

concerning Fourth Amendment motions.

21

and Stone v.

We believe that in almost any Fourth Amendment

22

situation where a defendant could claim that the trial

23

judge erred in failing to exclude evidence, he could

24

also claim that his attorney erred in failing to

25

properly present witnesses, and failing to properly

r

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

cross examine, and failing to properly bring case law

2

before the trial judge or argue the case before the

3

trial judge, in addition to trie fact that he could err

4

in just not bringing the motion itself.

We believe the

p

5

inquiries into the attorney performance concerned a

6

discretionary motion such as an exclusionary rule motion

7

should not be made for the same reason as we don't delve

8

into the reasons for excluding evidence in a normal

9

exclusionary rule context.

We believe that the state

10

courts can take care of the Fourth Amendment rules as

11

well as the District Courts can on habeas corpus, and

12

that that is sufficient for exclusionary rule purposes.

13

We also don't believe that we have a situation

14

here where we normally will have ineffective assistance

15

of counsel simply because of the elimination of this

16

type of evidence.

17

QUESTION*

Did either the District Court or

18

tae Court of Appeals say, analyzing the performance here

19

in terms of the Strickland versus Wainwright or

20

Washington, whatever that case name is, that there was

21

ineffective assistance of counsel across the board?

22

NR. NODES*

The District Court did not rule on

23

the basis of Strickland versus Washington.

24

rourt ruled under the Third

25

somewhat easier for defendants to meet than Strickland

The District

Circuit standard, which was

2

error

In that situation the trial judge ruled that the
was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

3

However, the District Court aiso said that

4

regardless of whether the Third Circuit standard was

5

used or New Jersey's farce and mockery standard were

6

used in this case, that the single errcr would have been

7

ineffective assistance of counsel.

8

seemed to imply that the conduct was professionally

9

unreasonable, but remanded for a decision on the

We would expect the trial

So the absence of that evidence, I think, is

significant.

The bad sheet evidence undermined his

credibility because it forced him to account for her

It caused him further prejudice because if the

the existence of a ssmen stain, which stain correlated

with Mr. Morrison's blood type, suggests that Mr.

HR. STAEHLEs

No,

the writ of certiorari was

urging this Court to find that under the Strickland

prejudice rather than to simply remind it tc the

back to the District Court it is not because we are not

confident of establishing sufficient prejudice before

KR. STREHLE*

The Court of Appeals also viewed

3

its standard as applied by the District Court as

conforming to the Strickland performance inquiry, and

5

the district judga found not only was defense counsel

6

incompetent, as it were, under the normal competency

standard, but also under the farce or mockery standard,

and it is that second finding which leads me to believe.

9

Justice O'Connor, that the district judge may very well

have been thinking along the lines that the entire

representation was flawed, but I can't go so far as to

represent that the district judge specifically made that

said so directly.

QUESTION*

One difficulty, of course, and the

tension that is in this case, in part, comes from the

I simply believe that where that

is compounded by a blatant Sixth Amendment violation,

3

that it goes past the point at which this Court can

4

simply defer to the state courts^
*

5

Kith respect to the federal stipulations, I do

6

not read Strickland as having dwelled on that fact in

7

its consideration of the Sixth Amendment or the alleged

8

Sixth Amendment violation as opposed to the Stone v.

9

Powell doctrine in the consideration of the Fourth

10

Amendment claim, and I don't see the word "comity"

11

appearing in the opinion, and I believe that the court

12

made essentially two assumptions.

13

Humber One,

that personal constitutional

rights such as the Sixth Amendment right to effective

the state courts understand

that the federal courts are

correct.

the failure to make the motion to suppress.

ineffectiveness than the one that you seem to

acknowledge.

12

HR. STAEHLE:

Yes, I believe it may be.

may have been focusing on simply the consequence of his

because he assumed that the victim wasn’t going forward

22

MR. STAEHLE*

I think that may have been the

reason for his failure to Jo discovery or conduct any

failing to undertake any formal discovery was because he

MR. STAEHLE:

To answer your question

This is just another example.
The trial judge ruled that there

was no surprise due to two things.

was that a month prior to trial defense counsel was

the semen stain taken from the bed sheet and the hairs

25

which are taken from the bed sheet.

One of these factors

Defense vas aware of this prior to that time
even because we had to make a motion in order to be able
to take defendant's hairs to test them, and at that time
he was aware that we .were testing them against other
evidence which had already been tested, such as the
semen stains on the bad sheet, so at least a month prior
to trial he knew about this.

He could have made a

motion at least at that time, and it wasn't a surprise.

He could have, but do you dispute

the federal trial judge's statemen?

counsel was ineffective under the standard announced in

Of course, that is a different case.

certain damaging evidence might have been the
appropriate subject for a suppression motion."
