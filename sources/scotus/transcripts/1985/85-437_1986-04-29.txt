HR. EE FRANKS:

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

certiorari to the New York Court of Appeals stems frcm

11

an action under New York’s public health law to abate a

12

nuisance allegedly occurring at respondent’s took store

13

premises.

14

In the trial court, respondents moved for

15

summary judgment, arguing that the closure prevision of

16

the public health laws constituted an impermissible

17

prior restraint.

18

affirmed by the intermediate appellate court.

19

York Court of Appeals, however, found the law, the

20

closure provision, that is, to constitute an unlawful

21

In this case it was a premises

11

notorious, because the undercover officer was able tc

12

observe it from the position he was in which was in the

13

area of the movie projectors, the booths.

14

As I was suggesting earlier, there is no

15

causal connection, and in this case the exercise of

that he may mcve to an alternative lccaticn , and as the

2

mars we have provided indicate, the alternative

3

locations are ample and reasonable in light of the fact

4

that the village of Kenmore is a ten-by-eighteen-block

5

village,:wholly consumed within the town cf Tcnawanda,

6

which is 15 times its size, and which also allows

7

alternative sites for adult uses.
/

9

That the sites might cost respondents more
than they are willing to spend is of nc moment.

As this

10

Court stated in Renton, economic impact, : which is the

11

only real impact here, economic impact is simply

12

irrelevant to a First Amendment inquiry, tut if we would

13

have assumed that economic impact somehow translates

14

into a restriction on speech , we would argue that this

15

is a legitimate time, place, or manner restriction, a

16

legimitate place restriction.

17

The law is content neutral.

It is unconcerned

18

with content.

19

to the Court of Appeals, it was neutral in all

20

respects.

assume might net be accorded to a car dealership or a

10

As this Court has stated in

I think in this case it is clear that the

government's interest would be served better with

Am I mistaken?

impression that under the statute, if the nuisance was

found to exist, the Court had no alternative.

That is the way the statute is

:written.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. CAMBRIA:

Yes.
And the way it has teen applied

23

by the Court of Appeals is to make this a permissive

24

rather than a mandatory closure, and the reason that

25

that was done was to say that based on this record, this
13

(202) 628-9300

would not be justified,

It: would not be the least

drastic means or the narrowest means, and the way the
Court of Appeals arrived at that, and I think that it
makes sense, because historically if you lock at
nuisance cases, we always see a broad area of discretion
given to the trial court to fashion a remedy, whether it
be First Amendment or just a factory, to fashion a
f

remedy that supposedly fits the nuisance as it is found
and as it is defined by the record.
QUESTION:

But your opponent here says that

the New York statutory scheme does not give trial courts
that sort of discretion here, that upon a showing cf
this kind, closure is mandatory.

Is he wrong, in your

view ?
MR. CAMBRIA:

That is what the statute says

literally, and the way that the Court of Appeals
interpreted that to be permissive versus mandatory:was
to analyze the record, analyze the law from this Court
and from the state court and make the determination
that
QUESTION:

The court below, as I understand

it, said the lirst Amendment in effect forced it to make
that decision, because it thought there were Eirst
Amendment values at stake here.
MR. CAMBRIA:

Isn't that right?

I think that is partly right.

There’s two things the court did.

effectuate, if you will, the legislation here, to close

happens by that statement is that the court interprets,

first of all, what the intent of its legislation is,

which I submit is legitimate fcr the highest court of

down from this Court, the Court has said that even in a

expressive conduct by an individual, the effect of the

QUESTION:

/

Up until

I thought the law that the District

6

Attorney was faced with, though, wouldn’t permit him

7

just to get an injunction.

MR. CAMBRIA:
is true at all.

They — no, I don’t believe that

The final relief provides fcr the

10

abatement.

11

relief here, there was never a sufficient shewing, and

12

they made two —

Interim relief is unrestricted, and interim

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. CAMBRIA:

Did they try to get an injunction?
Yes, and what the trial court

15

found was that they didn’t demonstrate that there were

16

not adequate legal remedies, that in addition they

17

didn’t —

QUESTION:

;Well, on that basis you would never

get an injunction .
MR. CAMBRIA:

No, I submit no. Your Honor.

For example -QUESTION:

legal remedies like indicting somebody.

Schaumberg case, which you wrote the decision in --

QUESTION:

3

MR. CAMBRIA:

That was a Court opinion.
-- you looked to the fact cf

4

using penal lavs in an area

5

means than using equitable remedies, or using other

6

remedies that weren't as narrow, and I submit they

7

legitimately did that here, and further,

for lesser or mere direct

I submit this,

that if they demonstrated below

10

QUESTION:

The listrict Attorney tried to get

an injunction, and the court wouldn’t give it to him.

11

MR. CAMBRIA:

Eecause they didn’t have a

12

sufficient shoving, net that it wouldn’t be proper with

13

a sufficient showing, but they didn’t have a sufficient

14

legal shewing, and the decision is here from the lower

15

court about the fact of the hearsay nature<cf it and the
0

16

fact that they tried never to have an arrest — I mean,

17

in these other cases we look at Croaton and Allouvill

18

and so on.

19

attempted to have a direct legal remedy be imposed, and

20

it failed, and then they had a proper record to shew

21

they could get a closure, and I submit in this case that

22

the area of expression is important enough that it is

23

not unreasonable to say that under the right case, under

24

the right circumstances pled and proved, they can get a

25

closure order, but under this case the record does net

They had arrests in those cases.

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

They

1

substantiate that.

2

legitimate, viable interim remedies here in a

3

substantialior sufficient way, and if they had all cf

4

the pervasiveness and so on, I have to assume they would

5

have moved under those grounds and said that, in fact,

6

even had alleged in their complaint that they needed

7

closure in order to step the activity on the store,

8

which they never even allege in their complaint.

9

We have no attempt whatsoever to try

So I submit —

10

QUESTION;

But I guess it is their legal

11

position that they don’t have to show that it is

12

necessary or that there is seme other place you can icve

13

if the statute means what it says, and closure follows

14

automatically from proof of this kind of activity.

15

MR. CAMBRIA*

16

QUESTION;

17

MR. CAMBRIA;

Well, but I don’t think that’s --

That’s their legal position .
I don’t think that’s — they

18

have net said that, because they would have to allege it

19

so that;we could at least deny it, so that then there

20

would be an issue of fact for someone to try —

21

QUESTION;

22

means.what it says.

No, they can just say the statute

23

MR. CAMBRIA;

24

QUESTION;

25

did.

The statute simply says —

And the Court of Appeals said it

They said, we have to construe the fact because cf

the First Amendment.
MR. CAMBRIAi

Right, the statote says there is

3

cne and only cne remedy basically no matter :what the

4

facts are, and I submit that is the problem here.

5

and only one remedy without regard to what the facts are

Cne

J

6

is the problem in this case, and it is not unreasonable,

7

I submit again, to say in this case where we have a

8

tctal cessation of this outlet without any demonstration

9

of other adequate outlets available, to say that it is

/

10

worth it and it is worth it to our system of free

11

expression to say attempt the injunction >cr get the

12

injunction, because they could certainly, from what they

13

allege here, take the position they could get a

14

permanent injunction at the end of a trial.

15

doesn’trwork like it didn’t in Croaton and it didn’t in

16

-- it did in the other case, but not in Crcatcn, then

17

they would be entitled to closure, and I think that is

18

why this statcte isn’t emasculated at all.

19

simply a reasonable response, saying let’s just tailor

20

it like we do any other nuisance.

21

If it

It is just

If we had a factory that was emitting

22

pollutants, it seems to me if we had a law that said any

23

pollutants emitted would require bulldozing down the

24

factory, that this Court would take a hard look at that

25

and say, well, wait a minute.

Isn’t there a lesser

means, a filter on the stack system cr what have ycu?

2

Co we have to bulldoze it down?

4

And I submit, that is what is happening here.
:We have an all or nothing blcndertust kind cf remedy, a

5

raachette versus the scalpel that ought to be used in the

6

First Amendment area, and I

7

response below is a reasonable one, and it is one that

8

deserves to be employed, and it may be thattwhen they

9

have the trial in this case they can demonstrate that it

just submit that that

/

10

is not effective to simply have an injunction, that

11

there must be a closure, and if that is sc, then I

12

submit that would be proper.

13

below be affirmed.

If not, I ask the decision

Just one thing. Your Honor.

correct that ycur position is, you don't have to prove

2

anything like that, that you are simply entitled tc

3

closure?

4

MR. EE FRANKS:

5

QUESTION:

On a first analysis, correct.

So it seems to me that you should

6

be saying to us, don't bother looking at alternatives.

7

We have a right to closure.

It is an effective remedy,

/

8
9

and so forth.

So I just don't understand ycur --

MR. EE FRANKS:

Right.

It is only on our

10

secondary analysis, time, place, and manner.

11

that our first position, our initial position is a much

12

stronger position .
