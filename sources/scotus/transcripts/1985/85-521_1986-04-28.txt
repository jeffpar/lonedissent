CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:. Mr. Willard, I think

you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD K. WILLARD, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF APPELLANTS
MR. WILLARD:

6
7

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

From 1950 until 1983, Social Security coverage

9

for state and local government employees was essentially

10

voluntary.

11

states could opt into the Social Security system for

12

groups of their employees and then, complying with

13

certain conditions, opt those coverage groups of

14

employees back out of the system.

15

Under the statute as it them existed, the

By 1983, with the legislation at issue today

16

in this case, it was enacted by Congress, more than nine

17

million of about 13 million state and local government

18

employees were in the Social Security system.

19

QUESTION:

Does your position, your argument,

20

assume that Congress could have put all of them under

21

Social Security in the first instance?

22

MR. WILLARD:

It certainly ooes, Mr. Chief

23

Justice, and in fact the District Court assumed arguendo

24

that was the case, and appellees in this case do not

25

argue to the contrary either.

And that really presents

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the question of what the District Court's holding means,

2

because if the Court's holding meant that the nine

3

million employees now in Social Security coverage haa a

4

perpetual right of withdrawal at the instance of their

5

states, it would be quite a sweeping holding that these

6

nine million employees now in Social Security could be

7

pulled out indefinitely whenever their states wanted to

8

pull them out.

9

But, as the Chief Justice's question pointed

10

out, that is not the basis for the holding of the

11

District Court.

12

pass a law mandating coverage for all Social Security --

13

for all state and local employees, or presumably a

14

rationally defined subset.

The Court assumes that Congress could

15

And so, the question is, what is this case

16

about, and it -- the answer seems to me, it is about

17

legislative draftsmanship.

18

told is that Congress chose a drafting technique in the

19

statute to make the Section 418 agreements

20

non-terminable.

21

That is, the advice we are

If Congress had simply ignored the Section 418

22

agreement, provided for coverage for these employees

23

outside of the pre-existing agreements, then there would

24

be no problem with the arrangement.

25

about legislative drafting really cannot possibly rise

And this quibble

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

to the level of a constitutional violation, as this

2

Court held in Usery against Turner Elkhorn Mining

3

Company, that the choice of statutory language cannot

4

invalidate this kind of statute when its operation and

5

effect are permissible.
Indeed, the option that the appellees would

6
7

prefer in this case would be more destructive, not less

8

destructive, of vested contract rights because under the

9

mandatory coverage option the Section 418 agreements in

10

their entirety would go out the window, not just one

11

provision, one strand out of the bundle of sticks which

12

has been affected by the 1983 amendments.
If you look at the effect of the 1983

13
14

amendments, it is not harsh and oppressive.

15

and their employees retain the primary benefit that

16

caused them to opt into coverage of the Social Security

17

system; that is, coverage in a comprehensive scheme of

18

death, disability and retirement benefits for their

19

employees.

20

The states

Now, much is made of the financial impact on

21

the state and local governments by requiring their

22

employees to stay in Social Security.

23

blunt about it.

24

from withdrawing their employees from Social Security

25

coverage is brought about because either they provide no

But let's be

The financial savings to the states

(202) 628-9300

1

benefits to replace the benefits that are lost, or

2

because they provide cheaper benefits to replace the

3

benefits that are lost.

4

The legislative history of 1983 amendments,

5

and I would refer the Court specifically to the 1982

6

House Ways and Means Committee print, documents that

7

Congress was very concerned about the harm to employees

8

from their employers' terminating Social Security

9

coverage, and the inadequacy of benefits that would be

t

10
11

provided, if at all, to the employees who withdraw.
As the statute -- the Section 418 agreements

12

previously, which permitted withdrawal of coverage, did

13

not require a referendum or vote of the employees before

14

their coverage was terminated.

15

states to provide a comparable level of benefits to

16

replace those that were being terminated.

17

It dio not require the

Basically, what it permitted, what the

18

appellees in this case argue, is that whenever the local

19

governments feel they need to save money, and they want

20

to save money by ending Social Security coverage for

21

their employees, then it's okay for them to oo it.

22

Now, it's not true that all employees are

23

necessarily harmed by the termination of coverage.

24

employees, particularly the older ones, can receive a

25

windfall benefit to the extent their Social Security
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Some

1

benefits are rather largely vested by the time coverage

2

is withdrawn, when they can take the money they were

3

putting into Social Security, invest it in some kind of

4

alternative savings or retirement scheme, and then when

5

they get to retirement age they can be double dippers.

6

They can get Social Security benefits which

7

they haven't paid tor, once their coverage is withdrawn,

8

and they can get benefits from this alternative program

9

they may have invested into.

But this is also a problem

10

Congress could take into account, and was motivated by

11

this 1983 amendment, that is, a desire to prevent

12

windfall benefits to some employees as a result of

13

having been in the system for a while and then opting

14

back out of the system, and putting their money

15

somewhere else.

16

These purposes, that is, the purpose of

17

protecting employees from the disadvantages of having

18

coverage withdrawn, ano the goal of preventing windfall

19

benefits to other employees whose coverage was

20

terminated, are the very typical kinds of legislative

21

motives which Congress can use to base economic and

22

social legislation, in which this Court routinely

23

[inaudible] with very minimal scrutiny.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Willard, are there any other

public assistance programs subject to agreements like
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the 418 Agreement?
MR. WILLARD:

2

There are programs that are

3

implemented in a similar way, Justice Brennan.

For

4

example, the mini-coverage such as AFDC and so forth are

5

cooperative programs and the states are not required to

6

participate in the programs if they don't want to, and

7

those programs involve similar kinds of conditions, as

8

we argued in our brief.

9

Now, it is true that this program is somewhat

10

unique in that in 1950 when it was adopted Congress was

11

concerned that there might be a constitutional problem

12

if they mandated coverage of state employees and Social

13

Security.

14

That problem is one which is no longer

15

considered to be a serious problem, but at the time they

16

did envision a --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

Was that because of the Tenth

Amendment jurisprudence?
MR. WILLARD:

That was presumably the problem,

20

Justice O'Connor, that concerned them.

Now, we don't

21

think under this Court's Tenth Amendment jurisprudence

22

that that would have been a serious problem, even prior

23

to the Garcia decision, because Social Security involves

24

the tax on spending power and not the [inaudible] , but

25

in any event there was enough uncertainty that this was
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to some extent a unique program because of that

2

constitutional problem.
But in substance, in effect, it is similar to

3
4

many other kinds of cooperative state-federal programs

5

> in that they give -- they are basea on statutes and the

6

agreements are simply a means of implementing the

7

statutory scheme and not something that has a life of

8

its own.

9

And therefore, when Congress changes the

10

economic ana social judgment that motivated the scheme,

11

as it did in 1983, this is the kind of change which is

12

not normally brought to destroy some vested rights but

13

instead is an exercise of the kind of judgment which

14

Congress routinely exercises and which this Court

15

routinely defers to Congress on.

16

So, the question is really, it seems, how aid

17

the district court go so far wrong in this kind of a

18

text, and I think the answer is, it was only by exalting

19

form over substance by applying a very formalistic

20

analysis to the transaction here, that the District

21

Court was able to hold that it was unconstitutional.

22

It created in effect a house of cards, ana

23

there are a number of defects in its analysis, any one

24

of which serves to unravel the construction of the

25

District Court.

In the first place, even on the most

The reason, Justice White,

3

appears to be, and the 1982 legislative history

4

corroborates this, is that they thought it was simply a

5

necessary incident of having a voluntary program.

6

If you think that the Constitution means that

7

you can only have voluntary coverage, then they put an

8

opt-out provision as reflective of that, not as an

9

inducement of the states to enter, but as a reflection

10

of what they thought the Constitution might be thought

11

to have required at the time.

There is no evidence to the

No, there isn't, Mr. Justice

White, but if I could refer to El Paso against Simmons,

a case where the Court held that the perpetual right of

22

redemption of interest defaulters in Texas was not the

23

key inducement of the contract, and in that case the

24

Court didn't go back and consider evidence about the

25

state of mind of purchasers under that contract.

Well, how many states wanted to

There were quite a few, I suppose.

MR. WILLARD:

10

I don't have the exact number.

There were.

There were several

hundred thousand employees, I think covered, out of nine

12

million.

13

So, there was a noticeable amount.
QUESTION:

But the fact is, it would appear

that the withdrawal was a rather important item?
MR. WILLARD:

That is not necessarily evidence

16

of the importance of that in 1950, Justice White.

Wouldn't you think in light of what's

The

question, though, is not what is the understanding of

states now, but what was it in 1951 when the states

11

opted into this coverage, and there is no evidence on

12

the record that California subjectively viewed this as

13

being particularly important.

14

In fact, the legislative history -- again, I

15

would refer especially to the 1982 committee print,

indicates Congress felt that this was not a major

QUESTION:

Then I'd have to say it was

MR. WILLARD:

No, Mr. Chief Justice, I'm not

rather large bundle of rights and responsibilities of

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD K. WILLARD, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLANTS -- Resumed
MR. WILLARD:

7

Mr. Chief Justice, ana may it

8

please the Court, I have just been referring to Section

9

1304 of the Act which provides express notice of

10

Congress's reservation of the right to amend, repeal or

11

alter the Social Security Act, and this was part of the

12

Act at the time the Section 418 agreements were entered

13

into in 1951, and certainly provided notice that the

14

statutory pattern was subject to change.
I'd like to turn now, though, to the question

15
16

about, even if there was abrogation of a vested contract

17

right, which was important to the parties when it was

18

entered into, whether this constitutes a taking within

19

the meaning of the Just Compensation Clause under this

20

Court's analysis, and I think it is fairly clear that it

21

does not.

22

The factors that are used by the Court vary.

23

They were most recently restated this term, in Connolly

24

versus Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which

25

reiterated some of the factors, the character of the
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

government action, the economic impact and the
interference with reasonable investment-backed
expectation.
In all of these cases, I think when you look
at the totality of the Social Security program and the
impact of participation in that program by the states,
the termination of the right to withdraw is not at such
a level as to constitute a taking under this Court's
teachings.
QUESTION:

Mr. Willard, do you take the

position that -- at least indirectly, that the United
States is not bound by a provision which it makes in one
of its own contracts, and if it could have made the
contract without that provision?
MR. WILLARD:
Chief Justice.

That is not our position, Mr.

The United States is never bound by

provision in its contracts.
Our position is that the contract here was
part of a statutory scheme.

It was authorized only to

the extent that it was consistent with the statutory
scheme, and where there was an expressed reservation in
the statute of the right to alter and amend the statute,
that the parties understood the contract was subject to
further modification as part of modification of the
statutory scheme.
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Ana so, in that sense it's not like a debt

1

2

contract where you would say the United States woula not

3

be authorized to simply repudiate it without regard to

4

the consequences.
QUESTION:

5

But each -I suppose that's bottomed on your

6

early premise that you mentioned before lunch, that the

7

government, without consulting any of the states or the

8

local governments, could have made all of their

9

employees subject to Social Security from the outset?
MR. WILLARD:

10

Well, that is certainly our

11

position in this case, Mr. Chief Justice, and it is not

12

a position that the district court or any of the

13

appellees have seriously disagreed with.

14

assumea that that was the case, where it could happen.

They have

And in that light as well, I think that the

15
16

takings analysis shows that there is not a serious

17

interference with a vested right.
QUESTION:

18

But if that were not so, if the

19

government could not have exercised that authority, then

20

would you say they woula be bouind by the contract

21

provision?

22

MR. WILLARD:

It would certainly place the

23

case in a different light, Mr. Chief Justice.

24

government could only impose this kind of obligation by

If the

1

the terms of the contract in a way of this nature would

2

present a more serious argument.
QUESTION:

3

Well, doesn't it make a lot of

4

difference whether the government is acting without the

5

authorization of Congress, ana who do we mean when we

6

are saying the government here, whether the government

7

is acting at the express authorization of Congress or

8

whether it's just -- the Executive branch is deciaing to

9

break a contract, about which perhaps Congress has said

10
11

nothing?
MR. WILLARD:

Well, certainly, Justice

12

Rehnquist, we do not argue here that the Executive has a

right to break contracts at all.

amendments.

Congress to legislate an achieve a legislative end,

scope of coverage in the social interest.
QUESTION:

But Congress is unilaterally

altering the contract.

5

MR. WILLARD:

Well, the question that everyone

6

is assuming, and I think the case law is clear, that

7

Congress could do that if it chose to do so, in effect

8

and that the -- that Congress -- that the nine million

9

state and local government employees covered by Social

10

Security don't have a perpetual right of withdrawal as a

11

result of the Section 418 agreements entered into.
If they were to acquire that, that would have

12
13

been a contract which would have bargained away

14

governmental authority to come out ana bargain.

15

basis of the district court's holding in this case, and

16

the essence of the claim by appellees, is the takings

17

claim; that is, there was a vested contract right here

18

that was taken away, and this was an uncompensated

19

taking.

20

The

And yet, the purposes of the takings clause

21

are quite different.

As the Court referred to this term

22

in Connolly for the purpose of forbidding uncompensated

23

takings of private property for public use, is to bar

24

the government from forcing some people around to bear

25

public burdens which in all fairness and justice could

QUESTION:

Well, I know.

The state says that,

you're taking our money that we'd like to spend on some

other way of taking care of our employees.
MR. WILLARD:

5

Well, Justice White, as I

6

indicated they're not required to spend that money on

7

taking care of their employees.
QUESTION:

8

That's right.

That's right.

But,

they are -- but the State is now being required to spend

some money that it thought it had the right to refuse to

That is certainly the effect of

that although you -- that means that we can amena this

2

contract to eliminate the withdrawal right?

3

MR. WILLARD:

4

QUESTION:

That's our position.

Don't you have to persuade the

5

Court -- Mr. Willard, doesn't the government have to

6

persuade the Court that given the right which you have

7

asserted, that Congress could have put this on every

8

employee of every one of the governmental subdivisions

9

in the first place, that authority could not be

10

contracted away by the provision which is in question

11

here?

12

MR. WILLARD:

That is our position, Mr. Chief

13

Justice, ana it's a position which no one has disagreed

14

with, not the district court, not the appellees.

15

Everyone has been willing to assume that Congress could

16

not contract away the authority to make these people

17

subject to Social Security, and it is our position, in

18

fact they did not do it.

19

But, whether they did or didn't, it's -- the

20

bottom line of this analysis is that Congress has to

21

maintain a reserve power to tax and spend for the

22

general welfare in this method.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Willard, could that have been

24

the first instance that caused this burden on the

25

emplyees of California and no other state, for example?

Because as I understand it, the states that got out in

time are out, aren't they?
MR. WILLARD:

3

Well, a small number of them

4

did.

But, we believe there is a rational distinction,

5

Justice Stevens, between keeping people in the system

6

who are already in, and not covering people who are out.

7

Most people --

8

QUESTION:

9

Yes, but to the extent that you

rely on the fact that we might have written the statute

10

that accomplishes this result, my question is, could you

11

have written a statute that applied to 45 states but not

12

50?

13
14
15

MR. WILLARD:

Well, that would depend on what

the rationale was, Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Well, if they had made it known

16

early enough that they didn't want to be part of it,

17

that's all.

MR. WILLARD:

That's not the way that this

statute operates.

It doesn't distinguish among states

reason for that.

It was the movement in and out of the system
that the legislative history shows Congress was

particularly concerned about, and I think that creates

more than enough of a rational basis for the distinction

they drew here, in effect.

for my argument, unless there are further questions of

that, by legislation?

7

MR HURWITZ:

Could it have done

I think not, Justice O'Connor,

and let me tell you why.

The contract right that we

9

gained in this circumstance was the right to leave the

10

system, was the right to terminate the agreement, no

11

better, no worse.
Once we got out of the system, once we got out

12
13

of the agreement, California could be treated like any

14

other state, no better, no worse.

15

would be every bit as direct an abrogation of the

contract to pass a law that only those states that

17

exercised their contract rights would be subject to

18

mandatory coverage.

But it seems to me it

That would be, in the words of the government,

20

exacting form over substance.

respond to the question that Justice Brennan asked

earlier.

We are aware, and the government points to

11

none in its brief, of any other federal program where

12

the right to terminate the state's participation is

from the government in any stage of this litigation a

7

Hurwitz, doesn't mean it's unconstitutional.
MR HURWITZ:

8
9

But the fact it's unique, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist.

No, quite to the contrary,

We think the contract is quite

10

constitutional.

We think the contract was drawn

11

pursuant to the powers that the federal government had

12

at the time, and we think that the federal government is

13

required as a matter of constitutional law to adhere to

14

this contract.

15

QUESTION:

16

the takings clause?

Not by the contracts clause, but by

MR HURWITZ:

17

That's correct, the contracts

18

clause is not applicable to the federal government,

19

although we do think that there's an analog in the due

20

process clause that would require the federal government

21

also to live up to its contracts.
QUESTION:

22
23
24
25

Well, what sort of an analog is

that?
MR HURWITZ:

This case -- this Court in the

Thorpe case indicated that for practical purposes the

MR HURWITZ:

10

With respect to the

effect, but the language in Thorpe on that point, I
think, is quite clear.

11

12

can prevail without resort to the due process clause.

13

We think it is the takings clause which should govern in

14

this case.

Mr. Hurwitz, can I ask you a

16

question about that?

17

the hypothetical of not all states being subject -- I

right.

20

would it not be precisely the same issue if all 50

states were in exactly the same position?

22

We have talked a little bit about

But for purposes of analyzing the takings issue,

MR HURWITZ:

tell you why, by way of an example.

This Court held a

where the government was acting again unaer the taxing

at the Darlington case, particularly Justice Harland's

Well, Mr. Hurwitz, it seems to me

the weakness of the argument is in not recognizing the

possibility that the contract itself reserved the right

reference to the federal law, which it made applicable,

14

and the federal law said provided for the right of

Congress to repeal or amend, reject.

that.
MR HURWITZ:

Once having entered into that

greater ability to repudiate the contract than the

The Constitution in the takings clause, the

With respect to the issue of cooperative

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD K. WILLARD, ESQ.

20

ON BEHALF OF THE APPELLEES -- REBUTTAL

21

MR. WILLARD:

If I could mention briefly,

22

first, this Court noted in its recent opinion in Pension

23

and Benefit Guaranty Corporation against R. A. Gray and

24

Company that the framers specifically rejected a

25

proposed amendment to the Constitution that would have
49

So, far from simply omitting it, it is

something that was considered and rejected by the

framers, as this Court's unanimous opinion in R. A. Gray

5

notea.

6

In comparing the contract situation with the

7

constraints on the federal government's repudiation on

8

debt as brought about in the Lynch case, I think we can

9

see some real comparisons.

In Lynch we had a situation

10

where we had a contractual scheme that was repudiatea

11

outright by the government by simply repealing the

12

authorizing statute, thus in effect repudiating the debt

13

totally and leaving nothing in its place.
And in fact, the Solicitor General in the

14
15

Lynch case refused to offer any kind of police power or

16

public welfare justification for the repudiation.

17

the only reason the government did it was, they wantea

18

to save money.

1

That would have rendered those agreements

2

totally worthless, and yet they coula have been repealed

3

outright ano there wouldn't have been a problem.

4

The fact here is that Congress did something

5

milder, much less of a violence to the contract, because

6

they simply repealed -- one provision was rendered moot,

7

not the entire contractual scheme.

8

reservation of right to do this is much less inclusive

9

than what Congress could have done, ano which the

10
11

Ano so, here the

appellees in this case don't really disagree with.
The important thing to keep in mind, though,

12

is that it's not simply repudiation of debt.

Congress

13

made a judgment there was a public welfare purpose to be

14

served for the benefit of the employees of state and

15

local governments, of keeping them in Social Security

16

coverage, that if your employers wanted to save money by

17

terminating your Social Security coverage, that that was

18

a bad thing, that for the benefit of the welfare of the

19

employees as well as for the integrity of the Social

20

Security system.

21

And so, this isn't a case where Congress said,

22

we want to save some money for the feaeral government so

1

May I ask, would the constitutional

issue be any different if Congress did no more than

accept this over the system?
MR. WILLARD:

4

That would present a case --

well, that would present a case that would be closer to

the Lynch situation.

motives, not simply to save money for the system.
You have to keep in mind that the Social

12

Security coverage is a two-way street.

While it's true

13

that the states and their employees pay money into the

14

system, they also receive benefits.

15

coverage for these employees, Congress is not simply

16

saying, we want to keep getting money and giving

noithing in return.

And so, by keeping

QUESTION:

Yes, but I think you would make the

same argument, they could get a better bargain elsewhere?
MR. WILLARD:

Well, I don't think that's

24

necessarily true, Justice Stevens, and the legislative

25

history carefully documents it, that in most of these

Security coverage goes with you from job to job, whereas

7

coverage in a state or local pension plan may not go

legislative history shows that Congress was concernea

10

about the lack of portability of benefits, especially

11

for younger employees who would be very seriously

12

disadvantaged if they didn't have Social Security

coverage.
That, after all, is the rationale for having a

nearly universal social insurance scheme, because it

provides a level of benefits to people, whether they

What happened to the employees in those

doesn't document what happened in each case.

alternative coverage provided was not as good as Social

In other words, it wasn't as comprehensive and

it certainly didn't provide the portability feature,

that is, the fact that the coverage would move with the

QUESTION:

Some coverage was provided?

MR. WILLARD:

1

Apparently they're not willing

2

to assert that kind of a claim because they're not that

3

sure of themselves.

4

QUESTION:

5

Well, I know, but I just wondered

what difference it would make.

6

MR. WILLARD:

Well, that's the essence of our

7

position, Justice White, is that since it wouldn't make

8

a difference those vested contract rights such as they

9

are couldn't be worth very much if they wouldn't stand

10

up in the face of that kind of legislative enactment.
QUESTION:

11

And that issue, whether Congress

has the power to put them all in or not, isn't in this
