ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR., ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. HEFT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, in this case the Kentucky Supreme

9

Court drew an artificial distinction between evidence

10

between confessions' voluntariness and evidence of its

11

credibility.

12

fundamental misunderstanding of confessions'

13

constitutional voluntariness and its factual

14

reliability, and it resulted of a violation of the

15

petitioner's right of cross examination and his right to

16

present a defense.

17

That distinction is premised on the

Reduced to its simplest form, the issue in

18

this case is whether a defendant can be constitutionally

19

prohibited from introducing evidence about the

20

circumstances under which his confession was obtained

21

for the purpose of showing its or challenging its

22

credibility simply because the trial judge has

23

determined a confession to be voluntary and therefore

24

admissible.

25

At the onset, defense counsel in this case

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

indicated in our opening statement that the theory of

2

defense was the circumstances under which this

3

confession was obtained were so — demonstrated the

4

confession's lack of credibility, and that that lack of

5

credibility created doubt as to the petitioner's guilt.

6

The prosecution in turn, perceiving defense

7

counsel's challenge as an attack on the trial court's

8

determination of the confession's constitutional

9

voluntariness, moved the defense be procluded or

10

prohibited from introducing any evidence about the

11

circumstances under which the confession was obtained.

12

The trial judge then ruled that the defense

13

could show evidence about factual inaccuracies in the

14

statements contained within the body of the confession,

15

but would be precluded from introducing any evidence

16

about the circumstances relating to the confession's

17

voluntariness.

18

from introducing any evidence about the size of the

19

interrogation room, the number of police officers

20

conducting the interrogation --

21

22
23

Consequently, the defense was prohibited

QUESTION:

What issue would that have borne

on, Mr. Heft?
MR. HEFT:

That bears on the credibility of

24

the confession, the length of the interogation and

25

detention, the number of police officers present, and

the size of the room.
QUESTION:

2

You say that even though it were

3

determined that the confession was voluntarily given/

4

those factors would perhaps induce the jury to believe

5

what?
MR. HEFT:

credibility.

That the confession also lacks

That evidence is —

8

QUESTION:

Why?

9

MR. HEFT:

Well, the evidence obviously is

10

germane to voluntariness.

11

credibility, because here the petitioner's statement of

12

confession is just riddled with factual mistakes and

13

inaccuracies.
QUESTION:

14
15

It is also germane to

But didn't the trial court say you

could produce evidence as to inaccuracies?
MR. HEFT:

16

Yes, and indeed defense counsel did

17

introduce that evidence.

18

the misstatement of the gun and the fact that an alarm

20

no alarm, the fact that the petitioner said he stole

money —

QUESTION:

the confession.
MR. HEFT:

But there is a reason for those

mistakes, Your Honor, and the jury was precluded from

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

hearing any evidence as to why the petitioners made

2

those statements, and the facts surrounding the

3

procurement of the confession are germane to a

4

determination of why the petitioner made those

5

statements.

6

The petitioner here was interrogated for a

7

period of time, approximately an hour and 40 minutes,

8

and indeed the jury was not informed of the fact that

9

the petitioner was questioned and talked about this

10

particular liquor store robbery for some nearly 45

11

minutes before he gave the written waiver of his

12

constitutional rights, and before the statement was

13

actually taped.

14

Surely those circumstances are germane to the

15

issue of credibility, because what happened in that

16

interrogation room does have a bearing on why the

17

petitioner --

18

QUESTION:

I thought the only two facts that

19

you wanted to get in that you couldn't get in was the

20

size of the room and the number of officers in it.

23

MR. HEFT:

That's true.

We wanted to get

those facts in.

Those are the only two facts that

you wanted to get before the jury that you didn't get

MR. HEFT:

those are the only facts, they were still very relevant

That's correct.

Now, Mr Heft, do you suppose that

even if there was an error here, that it could be

K

appropriate to apply?
MR. HEFT:

14

No, Your Honor, we don't feel that

15

this error is harmless.

16

such as to create doubt about the outcome of the trial

17

and to raise doubt about the reliability of the jury's

18

verdict.

19

20
21

QUESTION:

We believe that this error is

Well, do you agree that it is

subject to harmless error analysis?
MR. HEFT:

Well, I think that based on the

22

Court's most recent pronouncement in Delaware versus Van

23

Arsdale, the fact that restriction on plaintiff's right

1

of cross examination, that certainly is subject to the

25

harmless error analysis.

1

The Kentucky Supreme Court in determining --

2

in ruling on this issue relied on this Court's decisions

3

in Jackson v. Denno and Lego v. Twomey, concluded that

4

the petitioner or the defense could introduce evidence

5

about the credibility, the reliability, and the weight

6

of the confession, but the defense was precluded from

7

introducing any eveidence about the circumstances under

8

which the confession was obtained.

9

We would submit that that is based on an

10

artificial distinction that the courts sought to draw

11

from evidence of credibility and evidence of

12

voluntariness.

13

which the confession was obtained necessarily overlaps

14

with the issue of voluntariness and the issue of

15

credibility.

16

Evidence about the circumstances under

Moreover, the Kentucky court ruled that the

17

trial court's findings on the issue of the

18

constitutional voluntariness of this confession were

19

preclusive, and the preclusive to the extent of

20

preventing the defendant from introducing any evidence

21

about the circumstances under which the confession was

22

given simply because the trial judge had viewed the

23

light on those facts in determining the confession's

24

constitutional voluntariness.

25

QUESTION:

You don't insist that the issue of
8

(202) 628-9300

1

constitutional voluntariness has to be submitted to the

2

jury, do you?

3

MR. HEFT:

No, Your Honor.

The Kentucky

4

Supreme Court's decision reflects a fundamental

5

misunderstanding about the effect of the trial judge's

6

ruling or his determination that the confession was

7

constitutionally voluntary, and it further fails to

8

recognize the very different purposes served by

9

suppression hearings and a trial.

10

In a suppression hearing, of course, the

11

judge's function is to determine the evidence about the

12

circumstances under which the confession was obtained

13

and determine whether or not the confession was

14

constitutionally voluntary based on prevailing

15

constitutional standards.

16

determine the confession's truth, its falsity, its

17

credibility, or its reliability.

The trial judge doesn't

18

The jury, on the other hand is charged with —

19

during the course of the trial is charged with precisely

20

that responsbi1ity.

21

confession's truth, its falsity, its credibility, and it

22

weight in order to make its ultimate determination on

23

the issue of guilt or innocence.

24

fulfill that function where, as here, they are precluded

25

from hearing evidence about the circumstances under

It has to determine the

The jury simply cannot

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

which the confession was obtained.
The Kentucky Supreme Court's ruling violates

2
3

the petitioner's right to present a defense and his

4

right to cross examination because here defense counsel

5

is prevented from introducing evidence that supports his

6

theory of the defense and the confession is so lacking

7

in credibility that it does not have to be believed by

8

the jury and the jury doesn't have to give it any

9

weight.
I think it is probably easy to summarize this

10
11

by saying that although the jury could hear about the

12

factual inaccuracies of the confession, the jury simply

13

doesn't understand or was not given any evidence to

14

determine why the petitioner made those statements.

15

did he misstate such pertinent facts about the

16

circumstances surrounding this crime?

examinatio^.

Consequently, we would submit that the

2

effect of the Kentucky court's ruling is to deny the

3

petitioner an opportunity to answer and defend against

4

the state's charge.

5

from introducing evidence about the circumstances under

6

which his confession was obtained, and the jury cannot

7

therefore make a reliable assessment of the confession's

8

credibility and its weight, because the jury cannot

9

examine the effect of those circumstances under which

The petitioner has been prevented

10

his confession was obtained for determining its

11

credibility and its weight.

12

Ostensibly the state interest that was sought

13

to be protected in this situation was to prevent new

14

litigation of the issue of a confession's constitutional

15

voluntariness, but that issue simply can't be advanced

16

or protected by a blanket rule that prevents the

17

defendant from introducing circumstances under which his

18

confession is given, especially where the rule, as here,

19

is premised on some artifical distinction between a

20

confession's voluntariness and evidence of its

21

credibility.

22

The effect of such rule is to undermine

23

confidence in the outcome, and it substantially

24

diminishes the accuracy of the truthfinding process,

25

because the jury never hears evidence as to the ultimate
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

question of why the confession was made by the

2

petitioner, why did he make those misstatements of fact,

3

why are those inaccuracies contained within the

4

substance of his statement.

5

Thus, the jury is unable to assess the effect

6

of those circumstances on the confession's credibility

7

or its weight, and surely that creates doubt and

8

uncertainty as to the reliability and the accuracy of

9

the jury's findings on this issue.

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Heft?

11

MR. HEFT:

Yes, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION:

Suppose this is one thing happened,

13

that you asked the question, what size was the room that

14

my client was questioned in, and the judge -- the other

15

side objects on the grounds that it is immaterial, and

16

the judge sustains the objection without more.

17

you be here?

18

MR. HEFT:

Would

I think he would have to make a

19

specific objection saying that the size of the room

20

relates to the issue of the confession's credibility.

21

22

QUESTION:

And then the judge says, I still

think it is immaterial.

You would still be here?

23

MR. HEFT:

Yes, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION:

Is this room any larger or smaller

25

than other interrogation rooms?

18

MR. HEFT:

19

QUESTION:

How can you object to the size ■?

20

MR. HEFT:

Because the size of this room is

21

22
23
24
25

small.

I would say — well, the only one

It was ten by ten or ten by twelve at best.
QUESTION:

You don't insist on a room this

size, do you?
MR. HEFT:

No, Your Honor, but I think that is

a factor that the jury can use to determine the
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

credibility.

When the circumstances are viewed, the

2

petitioner being a 16-year-old boy operating at the

3

level ofa third or fourth grade child, is put in this

4

small room with several police officers, that bears on

5

the reliability of what the defendant or petitioner

6

states to those police officers in the course of that

7

interrogation.

8

size of the room is so significant.

And that why the room is -- I think the

The Kentucky Supreme Court based its decision

9
10

on several jusifications , one of which included

11

perceived difficulty in separating evidence of the

12

confession's voluntariness and evidence of its

13

credibility.

14

separation function is better vested in the trial judge

15

than in the hands of the jury.

The Kentucky court reasoned that the

That conclusion, however, is based on a

16
17

misperception of this Court's ruling in both Jackson and

18

Lego.

19

is in fact difficulty in separating evidence of a

20

confession's voluntariness from evidence of its

21

credibility, but neither case expressed any doubt that

22

the jury was fully capable of properly using evidence

23

for the purpose of determining a confession's

24

credibility and weight simply because evidence about the

25

circumstances under which the confession was obtained is

This Court acknowledged in those cases that there

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2

introduced
Neither did the Court express any doubt that

3

the jury could not properly discharge its factfinding

4

function merely because of the difficulty in separating

5

the evidence of a confession's voluntariness and

6

evidence of its guilt.

7

Indeed, the confidence that the jury can

8

properly use evidence is, I think, a matter of common

9

experience, and it is perhaps best reflected in the

10

multiple admissibility rules, which when applied to this

11

case would hold that evidence of a confession's

12

credibility is not inadmissible simply because it is

13

also evidence of a confession's voluntariness.

14

As we indicated in the appendices to our

15

brief, every jurisdiction with the exception of Kentucky

16

that has ruled on this matter allows a jury to determine

17

and hear evidence about the circumstances under which

18

the confession is obtained for the purpose of

19

determining either the confession's credibility, its

20

voluntariness, or both.

21

The second justification offered by the

22

Kentucky Supreme Court for its rule was that the

23

defendant offers very selective evidence when he doesn't

24

testify in cases in which his confession is admitted as

25

evidence against him.

The court was concerned that the
15

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

jury would not be made aware of the defendant's prior

2

experience with the law, his familiarity with

3

interrogating procedures, and his familiarity with his

4

Miranda rights.
Consequently, the Kentucky court reasoned that

5

6

exclusion of such evidence would allow the defense to

7

paint an unfair picture for the jury.

8

danger, however, is unlikely to exist in any case

9

because if the defendant were able to raise improper

That perceived

10

inferences from the evidence or raise or submit improper

11

evidence.

12

refute that evidence by making specific objections,

13

asking for admonitions, or even introducing rebuttal

14

evidence.

15

The prosecution surely could object and

The justifications for which the Kentucky

16

Supreme Court based its ruling herein do not justify the

17

abridgment of the constitutional rights of the

18

petitioner in this instance.

19

important to note that the state here was allowed to do

20

precisely what the defendant was not allowed to do, and

21

that is to introduce evidence about the circumstances

22

under which the confession was procured.

23

introduced evidence that on two occasions prior to

24

giving a statement petitioner was fully advised of his

25

Miranda rights.

Moreover, I think it is

The state

He was explained those rights in detail
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

and understood those rights.
Moreover, the state was allowed to introduce

2
3

evidence that during the course of the interrogation

4

procedure the petitioner was supplied with soft drinks

5

and refreshments by the police officers.

6

obviously, the purpose in introducing such evidence is

7

to demonstrate that petitioner was well treated during

8

the course of the confession, and thus the confession is

9

credible, reliable, and trustworthy.

Now,

Surely if the prosecution can introduce

10
11

evidence about the circumstances under which a

12

confession is given to demonstrate its credibility, the

13

same opportunity cannot be denied the defense where, as

14

here, his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights at

15

stake .
The determination of the Kentucky Supreme

16
17

Court in its ruling here undermines the historical and

18

the constitutional role of the jury to assess and

19

determine the credibility and reliability of evidence in

20

deciding the ultimate question of guilt and innocence.

21

The findings here of the trial judge were deemed

22

conclusive, and the jury could not consider any evidence

23

about the circumstances surrounding procurement of the

24

confession, because he had already used that evidence in

25

determining the confession's constitutional
t

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

voluntariness.
It is important here to realize that the

2
3

confession's constitutional voluntariness is made

4

without regard to its truth or its falsity, and

5

therefore it is imperative that the jury be advised in

6

full detail about all the evidence under which the

7

circumstances of the confession were procured because

8

they must -- the judge doesn't decide the issue of

9

credibility.

10
11

The issue must therefore be decided by the

jury.
Since involuntary confessions can, of course,

12

be untrue, it follows that as part of the right to

13

present a defense, defendant must be able to fully and

14

effectively cross examine and confront the police

15

officers who participated in the course of the

16

interrogation in order that the jury can assess the

17

effect of the circumstances on the voluntariness of the

18

confession.

19

We would submit here that the Kentucky Supreme

20

Court violated the petitioner's right to present a

21

defense and his right to cross examination, and that the

22

rule created by Kentucky is not only an artifical

23

distinction it sought to draw, but it is premised on a

24

fundamental misunderstanding of the effect of the role

25

that the trial judge plays in the suppression hearing.
18

(202) 628-9300

Consequently, the rule enacted by Kentucky
results in an impermissible interference in the
petitioner's right to present a defense, and we would
urge the Court to reverse the decision and remand the
case for a new trial.

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

Very well.

Gillig .
ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN S. GILLIG, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. GILLIG:

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may

it please the Court, before proceeding with our analysis
of the issue in this case, we would like to correct,
first of all, what is perhaps a mistake or a different
emphasis in the facts, and that is that Major Crane was
operating at a somehow diminished level or diminished

It was true, and it was stated that he was
operating at a low academic level in the third or fourth
grade, but he was evaluated as a sophisticated
delinguent, and in its findings of fact and conclusions
of law the trial court stated that he had had numerous
experiences with the law, and was street wise, and knew
very well what he was doing, and so we simply want to
point that out to the Court.
QUESTION:

How does that bear on these

1

curious, almost fantasy responses?
MR. GILLIG:

2

Well, I think it bears on that

3

simply because it is not the basis for these responses.

4

I wouldn't be able to speculate why he said exactly what

5

he said.
QUESTION:

6

Hypothetically, it may be that he

7

had committed so many of these offenses that he got them

8

confused in the record.
MR. GILLIG:

9

QUESTION:

10

Absolutely, Your Honor.
Even assuming that is true, why

11

aren't the circumstances admissible evidence under the

12

Lego case?

13

MR. GILLIG:

Well, our contention is that the

14

rule of the Kentucky Supreme Court in Crane is

15

unexceptional in that it merely states that evidence to

16

be admissible must be relevant, and the Kentucky Supreme

17

Court said that in this case this evidence was simply

18

irrelevant.

19

Now, Lego said that the states have been as

20

free since Jackson v. Denno as they were before to

21

formulate their own rules of procedure so long as

22

adequate safeguards are provided, and we believe that

23

the Kentucky Supreme Court has done just that.

24

not anything unusual or exceptional to say that evidence

25

should be relevant, and the trial court merely made a
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It is

1

ruling that the evidence was relevant, and that was

2

upheld by the Kentucky Supreme Court.
So, we don't believe that Lego approves the

3
4

procedure which was used by Kentucky in this case, but

5

it doesn't really address the issue that is presented

6

here, if indeed there is an issue presented.
QUESTION:

7

Well, is your submission that any

8

evidence that went into the voluntariness finding by the

9

judge should -- is wholly irrelevant to the reliability

10

of the confession?
MR. GILLIG:

11

No, Your Honor, not at all.

In

12

fact, if I could read just briefly from the holding of

13

the Kentucky Supreme Court, it said once a hearing has

14

been conducted pursuant to the rule, and the trial court

15

has made its ruling, then that ruling or finding that

16

the confession was voluntary is conclusive, as this

17

Court permitted in Jackson versus Denno.
The trial court may exclude evidence relating

18
19

to voluntariness from consideration by the jury when

20

that evidence has little or no relationship to any other

issue.

authenticity, reliability, or credibility.

QUESTION:

1

Well, then, this case just boils

2

down to you would think there would be some evidence

3

that if the trial judge excluded, it would be error.

4

Some evidence that was introduced at the voluntariness

5

hearing you would think should be admissible.
MR. GILLIG:

6

I would say it could be argued

7

that if that evidence had been used in the voluntariness

8

hearing, then you could present the argument to the

9

trial court that that issue had already been taken care

10

of.

QUESTION:

11

I know, but can you think of any

12

evidence that should be admissible with respect to

13

reliability that was used at the voluntariness hearing?
MR. GILLIG:

14
15

Well, I think that would depend

quite a bit on the case.

16

QUESTION:

So you can't even imagine any?

17

MR. GILLIG:

No, sir.

I would say as a matter

18

of fact we could say that assuming the petitioner in

19

this case, if he were claustrophobic, perhaps, then you

20

could lay a foundation that that might be relevant —
QUESTION:

21

So really the Supreme Court's

reservation really doesn't mean very much.

What you are

evidence that the Constitution would require be

admitted.

And then in that case

there may be other cases in which the evidence which is

QUESTION:

9

Why doesn't the evidence as to the

size of the room here which the defendant wanted to get

at by cross examination, why doesn't that bear on

reliability in the sense used by the Supreme Court of

Kentucky ?
MR. GILLIG:

Well, I beliee that -- well, of

course —
Q U E STION:

The fellow was in a fairly small

room, you know, a hot -- you know, let's assume a hot

18

sweatbox, four or five officers there.

19

he wasn't thinking too clearly.

20

MR. GILLIG:

You know, maybe

Well, of course, that brings up

21

another point.

His contention was that he made up a

22

story to please the police, so I don't think if he were

23

in a sweatbox type situation that that would necessarily

24

relate to his propensity to make up a story to please

25

the police, just as I might, say, make up a story to
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

please a teacher, or some other authority.
QUESTION:

2

I thought that often defendants

3

under interrogation felt a compulsion to say something,

4

tell something to satisfy the police and get them off

5

his back .
MR. GILLIG:

6

Well, if that is the case, if

7

that is the basis for him saying that, then we would

8

argue that it would be a case of coercion, and then the

9

confession would be involuntary in any event, but we are

10

not saying that it is impossible for another court to

11

disagree with the findings of the Kentucky Supreme Court

12

that this evidence in fact was not relevant to this

13

case.

14

go back to the basic premise presented by the case,

15

which is simply, once the voluntariness issue was

16

decided, that some evidence which is presented in the

17

voluntariness hearing may then be properly excluded by

18

the trial court at the regular trial.

Another court may so find, but that still doesn't

If we could point out, in the petitioner's

19

20

petition for cert to this Court, in some language that

21

was dropped in a later brief, he said that in this case

22

the fact that a petitioner was given his Miranda

23

warnings wouldn't have made any difference to this

24

case.

25

his Miranda warnings might well and would indeed bear on

The Miranda warnings, the fact that he was given

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the voluntariness of his confession, but it really isn't

2

relevant, as petitioner has stated before, to

3

determining whether or not he made up a story to please

4

the police.
If the Court disagrees with that finding of

5

6

relevance, then that would be another factor to this

7

case, but it doesn't go back to the basic premise that

8

evidence, to be admissible, must be relevant, and that

9

is all this opinion says from the Kentucky Supreme

10
11

Court.
QUESTION:

Mr. Gillig, may I interrupt?

I

12

think one can read -- the Kentucky Supreme Court opinion

13

is a little bit ambiguous, I have to agree, but having

14

read the dissent, and the dissent seems to have read the

15

majority as saying that voluntariness and credibility

16

are sort of mutually exclusive categories, and that if

17

it relates to voluntarines, then it is almost

18

presumptively not relevant on credibility, it seems to

19

me one can read the Kentucky Supreme Court opinion that

20

way, as saying they are two quite separate issues, and

21

you are not defending that interpretation of the

22

opinion, if I understand you.

23

read the opinion differently.

24
25

MR. GILLIG:

You are saying we should

Yes, I would -- I am not

defending the sense interpretation of this opinion.
25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

In

1

the opinion it says that the evidence in this case

2

related solely to voluntariness, but it also said,

3

having little or no relationship to any other issue, and

4

if evidence has little relationship to any other issue,

5

it may have some relationship, so I think there is a bit

6

of ambiguity there that would enable a finder of fact or

7

a trial court to conclude that, yes, there can be some,

8

there can be evidence which is relevant to the

9

voluntariness that is not relevant to credibility.

10

Of course, it works the opposite way as well.

11

The trial court in making that determination in the

12

suppression hearing is not permitted to examine the

13

reliability of the confession in determining whether or

14

not the confession is voluntary.

15

the decisions of this Court have indeed, I think,

16

recognized a distinction.

because I believe that you could go ahead and -- if

12

there is a distinction to be made, then it may be the

How does avowal testimony differ

There is some testimony,

to the effect that he was in the fourth grade or had

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

ability at that level.
MR. GILLIG:

2

Yes, Your Honor.

He had been

3

evaluated six months prior to this by a social worker.

4

He was in a program for juvenile delinquents essentially

5

on another crime, and had been evaluated as operating at

6

an academic third or fourth grade level.

7

court heard Major Crane testify at the suppression

8

hearing, and at the conclusion of that time the trial

9

court simply said that this court recognizes that there

13

had evaluated him as a sophisticated delinquent who knew

14

how to manipulate people to get what he wanted, and the

15

trial court again found him to be street wise.
QUESTION:

16
17

The trial court -- and the social worker

graduate people who are third and fourth grade?
MR. GILLIG:

18

I think that happens in

Kentucky.

I think it happens everywhere.

The fact that

20

one has a high school diploma doesn't necessarily mean

21

that one can read, unfortunately, but he certainly

22

didn't have a high school diploma in this case.

23

believe that is in evidence.

24

prior experiences with the law are the kinds of factors

25

which are relevant to a suppresseion hearing and which

are brought out fully before the trier of fact but which

What would be wrong with such a rule?

MR. GILLIG:

Well, of course, that is

essetially the Massachusetts rule.

What we argue is

36

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

wrong with the Massachusetts rule, two things.

2

all, the trial judge who is making the initial

3

voluntariness determination, if he knows that all that

4

evidence is going to be presented to the jury again,

5

then he has a reason to just sort of take a brief look

6

at that confession and maybe not give the voluntariness

7

hearing, the initial suppression hearing the emphasis

8

that it deserves as a binding, as a final, as a

9

determination of that defendant's rights, whether they

10

11

have been violated -QUESTION:

So it is only final to the extent

12

that it governs admissibility before the jury.

13

not final in any other sense.

14

First of

MR. GILLIG:

It is

Yes, under the Massachusetts

15

rule, but he may tend to just pass that along pro forma,

16

and then you go back to what the result this Court

17

disapproved of in Stein versus New York, which was also

18

a case where the trial court would simply look at the

19

confession, see if there was a reasonable issue, and

20

then send it to the jury, and the problem this Court

21

found with that, and the problem that is still, we

22

believe, in the Massachusetts rule is that once the jury

23

gets the confession, makes the decision, there is no

24

real way to say, well, did they rely on the confession

25

and convict because of the confession, or did they not

(202) 628-9300

1

rely on the confession and convict him anyway, and that

2

can cause problems later on for appellate review.

3

QUESTION:

You are really arguing that the

4

rule that you favor is better for the defendant.

That

5

is what you are really arguing.

6

MR. GILLIG:

7

We would simply say again that there are some

Yes, sir, we believe so.

8

sound policy reasons for this rule that have been

9

enumerated by the Kentucky Supreme Court.

The Kentucky

10

Supreme Court pointed out first that there was a

11

difficulty in separating the factors relating to

12

voluntariness and credibility, and felt that this

13

determination, because there is some difficulty, is best

14

left to the trial judge, not in the minds of the jurors.

15

The Kentucky Supreme Court pointed out that

16

voluntariness is a settled issue, so that to the extent

17

that evidence would relate to voluntariness, then it is

18

not really necessary to retry that issue, and finally,

19

if the evidence of voluntariness is retried to the jury,

20

then there is the possibility of confusing the jury,

21

there is the possibility that the defendant's previous

22

experiences with the law would not get in, there is the

23

possibility that his familiarity with Miranda rights and

24

other things that would be relevant to the voluntariness

25

hearing simply wouldn't be introduced, and the
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

petitioner here has made the argument that if the

2

prosecution could rebut, if the defendant got up and

3

because he didn't take the stand created the impression

4

that he was somehow misled by the police or coerced by

5

the police essentially and arguing the voluntariness all

6

over again.
The problem is that under Kentucky he would

7

8

not be able to rebut, even if the petitioner takes the

9

stand under Kentucky law the most you can do is ask if

10

he has ever been convicted of a felony, and then when he

11

says, yes, I have, then that is the end of it.

12

can't say, well, how many times have you been arrested,

13

how many times have you been interrogated.

14

can't say, well, I have been interrogated ten or twenty

15

times just this year.

16

effectively rebut a presumption, assuming such a

17

presumption would be created.

You

A defendant

It is simply not possible to

One final point that the petitioner brought

18
19

out.

He says that Kentucky stands alone on this issue.

20

I don't believe if the Court examines the cases which

21

are presented in the appendix to his brief that you will

22

find that Kentucky does stand alone.

23

that other states stand with us.

24

we stand alone.

25

sort out exactly where the states would come down on

We are not saying

We are not saying that

The problem is, it is very difficult to

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I

1

this issue, because it has not really been presented.
In many of the citations in his brief, for

2
3

example, citations to rules, State Rules of Evidence,

4

Number 104, those are all patterned on the Federal Rule

5

of Evidence 104, and all that says is that no evidence

6

relating to the weight or credibility of the confession

7

shall be excluded, and that is exactly what Crane versus

8

Commonwealth says.
So, simply because a state court cites to

9
10

their own rule of evidence which is patterned on Federal

11

Rule of Evidence 104, it doesn't mean that they have

12

looked at this issue or they have decided this issue.

13

As we point out in our brief, we believe that the

14

impetus for the Kentucky court's ruling or the Kentucky

15

court's holding in Crane is simply that it is recognized

16

the degree to which this Court has adjusted what may

17

come into a voluntariness confession and simply

18

recognizes that they don't need to retry that issue

19

before the jury.

20

And so for these reasons we believe that the

21

rule of the Kentucky Supreme Court in Crane is a valid

22

rule.

23

that reason it should be affirmed.

It doesn't break any new ground, really, and for

24

If there are no other questions.

anything further, Mr. Heft?
ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. HEFT, JR., ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL
MR. HEFT:

May it please the Court, I have

just got a couple of points to make on rebuttal.
First of all, to answer just a couple of the

7

factual questions that were raised during questioning by

8

the Court, in regard to Justice Powell's question about

9

the petitioner being able to call his parents, he did

10

state at Page 19 of the joint appendix that he requested

11

to call his parents and he was not permitted to do so by

12

the police.

13

suppression hearing that they made efforts to contact

14

his family.

15

Of course, the police did testify in the

I would also like to point out that it seems

16

to me that the questions relative to how the dissent in

17

this case interpreted the majority's view of the rule is

18

a point well taken because here on Page 29 of the

19

respondent's brief the respondent argues that if the

20

trial court rules the confession voluntary it admits

21

into evidence none, emphasis by the respondent, none of

22

the circumstances surrounding procurement are relevant

23

towards credibility.

24

Kentucky Supreme Court rule here.

25

The dissent correctly analyzed the

Moreover, if, as has been indicated in our
41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

brief, this is not the kind of situation, I believe, in

2

which the Court can approach the issue or resolve the

3

issue by a bright line approach, because evidence of

4

credibility necessarily overlaps with evidence of

5

voluntariness.

6

effect, if we can somehow -- is that the trial -- first

7

of all, defense counsel is going to have to make some

8

kind of a determination pretrial what is evidence of

9

voluntariness and what is evidence of credibility.

What the responding is arguing is, in

Secondly, the trial judge is going to -- every trial

11

judge in the country is going to have to make that

12

determination, and then every appellate court in the

13

country is going to have to review that decision.

We

14

think that would create an administrative and judicial

15

nightmare.

QUESTION:

Is it possible that this is,

assuming error, that it is harmless error?
MR. HEFT:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

19

this is harmless.

that the error here affected the outcome and raised

21

doubts as to the reliability of the jury's verdict.

pointed out in our brief the evidence of guilt was not

we pointed out, was motivated in order to minimize his

culpability here.
