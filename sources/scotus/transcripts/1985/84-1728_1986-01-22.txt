ORAL ARGUMENT OF CAROLYN B. KUHL, ESQ.

5

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER
MS. KUHLi

may it please the Court.
The issue in this case is whether a Government

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

employee union can ceguire a Government agency to

10

bargain over, and therefore to make a subject of

11

grievance arbitration, a proposal that would give the

12

union the right to enforce the provisions of Circular

13

A-76 .

14

The court below neli that a Government

15

employee union can enforce the circular, but this result

16

is anomalous.

17

from the authority of the President to manage the budget

18

and to manage the Executive Branch, and it implements

19

the President's economic policies.

A-75 is a management directive.

21

President and to his delegates the authority to enforce

This result is not only contrary to the

with the authority of the President to give directives

But on the contrary, the statute in fact

requires no such solution.

13

very quickly the statutory provisions that are at

14

issue.

15

Service Reform Act gives management the right to make

16

determinations with respect to contracting out, and all

17

parties also agree that the only constraint on that

18

management

19

constraint that’s at issue in this case -- is that the

20

right to contract out be exercised "in accordance with

21

applicable laws."

22

Let me try to condense here

All the parties agree that Title 7 of the Civil

right is that it hi — that is, the only

So that the question for decision is whether

23

the phrase "in accordance *itn applicable laws" gives

24

the union a right that no one other that the President

25

has, the right to enforce circular A-76.

The first and

(202) 628-9300

1

most important reason why the "in accordance with

2

applicable laws" language does not give the union the

3

right to enforce tie circular is because A-76 is not a

4

law at all.
QUESTION*

5

Well/ Ns. Kuhl, suppose that we

6

agreed that the circular is not a law for purposes of

Section 7106.

HS. KUHL*

Justice O'Sonnor.
QUESTION*

14
15

What is the inquiry?

If you say

it's not a law under 7135?
NS. KUHL*

16
17

That ends the inquiry in our view,

That's correct.

If you say it's

not a law, that ends the iiguiry, because - QUESTION*

18

I thought your opponent says it

19

doesn't, because in any event it's grievable unde, the

20

Act.

21

NS. KUHL*

That's right.

But it's our

22

submission that the language of 7106, which says nothing

23

in this chapter shill interfere with manage ment rights,

24

that that applies to not only the negotiability issue,

25

but also to the grievability issue, and the Respondents

I take it, though, that you take

-- the circular is a rule or

is a bit different.

that Congress was concerned that unions not be able to

17

Well, of course the language there

It says

And again, theres no furthet right to review

Every court and administrative body other than

14

the court below that has been asked to enforce circular

15

A-76 has respected the limitations that are contained

16

within the language of the circular itself and has

17

refused to create third party enforcement rights.

18

Courts of Appeal ha/e turned down challenges brought

19

under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Ninth

of the court below.

Thus, is seeking the right to enforce A-76,

6

the union is seeking a right that non-union employees

Cpngress did not anywhere express any intent to create

this kind of disparity.

on management rights, other than an effect on grievance

effect?

Would there be any other

14

MS. KUHL;

Well, it would have really a very

15

substantive effect.

16

proposal is a modest one of trying to enforce A-76.

17

because they want to enforce ft-76, but don't want to

18

accept tna conditions under which the Iresident

19

willing to issue A-V6, the union's discretion to make

Well,

If it has

6

Justice O'Connor, the agency is really placed in a

difficult dilemma.
QUESTION:

10

The agency —
Well, it is — you agree that it

would have no effect other than on grievance and
arbitration procedures?
MS. niHLf

11

Well, the grievance and arbitration

12

— I think our point is that the grievance and

13

arbitration procedures would affect the substance of

14

contracting out, because the agency’s decisions will be

15

affected.

16

QUESTION:

Well, the other side takes the

17

position that the Act requires that these matters be

18

subject to grievance and arbitration anyway.

19

MS. KUHL:

That's correct, but that's because

20

they do not admit that the "nothing in this chapter”

21

language applies to the grievance proceedings as well as

22

to tne negotiability content.

23

But the reason why there's a substantive

24

problem here and not just a procedural problem for the

25

agency is because when a grievance is filed the agency
10

2UESTI3N;

It e i t h e c has to decide

Well, be a little? more concrete.

5

The kind of a grievance thi t would be filed is that when

6

there's a proposal to contract out the union would

7

grieve and say that you’re not following the right

8

procedures and you mist not

9

that it?
MS. KIJHL:

10

do this until you 3d; is

That's right.

And to be a little

11

more concrete, they might say, for example, well, you

12

didn't determine personnel cost correctly in making your

13

comparison between in-house costs and costs that would

14

be incurred using an outsiie contractor.
QUESTION;

15

And if the arbitrator agreed with

16

them, the contracting oat rfould be interfered with, I

17

gather?

18

MS. KUHL«

It would he.

And in fact, it's

19

interesting, the Authority even agrees that management

20

discretion would be interfered with under those

21

circumstances.

22

They say at least in some cases.

Now, their proposed solution we think is not

23

really a solution it all.

They say the arbitrators will

24

stay their hands; lon't worry, the arbitrators will not

25

be permitted

to second guess discretionary judgments of

statutory language which would so constrain the

conclusion from that that the Authority doesn't fully

6

believe what is says.

7

rights clause does not apply to the grievance

proceedings, but yet they say, well,

get into a discretionary area they'll stay their hands.

10

And actually, I draw the

(202) 628-9300

— and of course we don’t concede that it is a law —

2

but if it is a law, we say that it is not an applicable

law witiiin the meaning of the statute.

4

that we say that is because we read the "in accordance

5

with applicable laws" language to give unions the right

6

only to enforce laws that have rights personal, directly

7

personal, to the employees.

find the reason

8

If you read the phrase "in accordance with

9

applicable law" more broadly than that, you run into

10

some quite anomalous results, and Respondents do not

11

explain why this result could have been intended by

12

Congress.

13

They wouLdn’t draw any lines.

They would say

14

"in accordance with applicable law" means that so long

15

as the agency’s action is constrained by some law

16

somewhere, and so long as the agency’s action has some

17

effect on employees somehow, then there can be review or

18

the unions can enforce that law.

19

But to just give a hypothetical of why that

20

reads "in accordance with applicable laws" much too

21

broadly, suppose Congress instructs the Forest Service

22

to give priority to fire prevention, and suppose that

23

the Forest Service then iecides that it should conduct a

24

reduction in force and some Forest Service personnel are

25

included in

that reiuction in force.
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The authority's 3 onstruction, the Respondent's

1

2

construction, would seem to allow the union to come in

3

and argue that the reduction in force was not in

4

accordance with applicable law because Congress had

5

indicated that fire prevention was a priority.
QUESTION;

6
7

would that then be decided by an arbitrator?

8
9

That's correct,

it would be decided

QUESTION;

Whether the fire service — Forest

Service was laying off the right people?
MS. KUHL;

12
13

NS. !CUHL;
by —

10
11

Well, unier tne anion’s theory,

That*3 right, it would be iecided

by an arbitrator.
So that their con struct ion really lea is to the

14
15

conclusion or would suggest tl.at Congress intended to

16

create very broad private rights of action for union

17

employees.

18

of action should be inferred only when Congress has

19

intended to create such reneuies, ini there is no

20

indication of a Congressional intent here to create such

21

broad rights of action.

But this Court has held that private rights

22

To give the unions this kind of broad right of

23

action would create a great disparity, as I’ve suggested

24

before, between union and non-union employees in terms

25

of the type of statutes that they can seek to enforce.

(202) 628-9300

1

And as I say, there’s no evidence Congress intended

2

this .
What we ran glean from the legislative history

3
4

is that Congress intended to take traditional personnel

5

decisions that eitier union on non-union employees could

6

bring under the oil executive order regime and to give

7

unions the ability to

9

interpretation that the Respondents would give to the

taxe these kinds of rights and
The broad

10

"in accordance with applicable law" language would also

11

interfere with the management rights that are preserved

12

in 7106 subsection (a)(1).
To look at the structure of the statute,

13
14

subsection (a)(1) management rights, which are the right

15

In other words, the agency insofar as the union

But the Respondent’s interpretation of "in

to be brought under

This is rather difficult, but let me try and give a

management’s authority to contract out, because every

2

aspect of circular A-75 involves matters of agency

discretion.

One of tie chief reasons why courts have

5

declined under the APA. to review compliance with A-76 is

that it lacks meaningful standards by which

involved in an ageicy’s carrying out circular A-76, when

the cost comparison is dona by the agency it is premised

11

on a management study that the agency has to conduct to

12

determine the most efficient composition by which the

13

agency could perform the function, so that already you

have an element of estimation, an element of exercise of

15

agency judgment, in just determining what the in-house

The circular then goes on to say that,

tools, that the agency is to use.

21

before, even

22

arbitral review for compliance with A-76 will at least

sometimes impinge on ageny discretion.

24

solution that they offer is a clearly inadequate one of

just the hope that arbitrators will stay their hands

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RUTH E. PETERS, ESQ.

Ms. Peters.

OS BEHALF OF RESPONDESTS
MS. PETERS;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
One of tie respoisibilities entrusted to the

11

Federal Labor Relations Authority by Congress is the

12

task of determining the negotiability of collective

13

bargaining proposals in the federal sector.

14

arose nearly six years ago now when AFGE submitted a

15

proposal which pro/iled that Petitioner EEOC agree to

16

comply with 0MB circular A-76 and other applicable laws

17

and regulations concerning contracting out.

18

Authority found the proposal to be negotiable.

19

This case

The

Underlying the Authority's determination are

20

three basic propositions to which the Authority has

21

adhered since the first days of Its enabling statute,

22

the first proposition here being that the statute does

23

indeed reserve to management as noi-negotiable the

24

substantive exercise in accordance with applicable laws

25

of the management rights enumerated in Section
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F si., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

7105(a)(2); however,

2

that imposes no substantiva limitations of its own

3

making, that simpla restates management's obligation to

4

comply with applicable legal requirements when

5

exercising th osa. ra sa rval rights, is negotiable.

6

a proposal such as the one here

The second proposition hare being that the

7

statute in the federal sector defines the scope of the

8

negotiated grievance procedure.

9

absence of a proposal such as the one here, with or

Thus, even in the

10

without such a proposal, disputes about the applications

11

of laws, rules, and regulations such as the circular,

12

affecting conditions of employment, are within the scope

13

of the grievance procedure unless the parties agree

14

through negotiations to exclude such grievances.

15

The final proposition here is likewise rooted

16

in fhe notion that the statute prescribes the scope and

17

the coverage of a negotiated grievance procedure in the

18

federal sector.

19

regulation, including the circular,

20

regulation purporting

21

in some fashion of the grievance procedure, may be

22

applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the scope

23

as defined by this !Vct of Congress.

24
25

Tnus, no Z overam ant-wide rule or
;ven a rule or

to address the permissible scope

Having stated these propositions,

I would also

like to note, because I think it is pertinent to an

understanding of tils case,

2

Authority’s decision takes absolutely no root, and that

3

is this Authority lecision ani no Authority decision of

which

5

support for the notion that in the area of management’s

6

reserved rights choices of poLicy or natters o£

7

discretion that management reserves to itself are

8

somehow susceptible to the bargaining process or to the

9

grievance procedure.

10

one proposition in which the

I am aware either is based upon or provides any

An examination of the first proposition, that

11

proposals such as the one here are negotiable,

12

demonstrates the faithfulness of the Authority in this

13

decision to the text of the statute and to its own

14

decisional precedent.

15

management in Section 7106(a)(2), along with other

16

rights, the non-nejotiable substantive authority to make

17

determinations with respect to contracting out.

The statute does reserve to

22

of the statute, that authority is subject, first of all,

23

25

7106(b)(3).

Furthermore, the statute expressly provides

2

that management's contracting oat authority, as well as

3

the other enumerate! reserved rights, must be exercised

4

in accordance with applicable laws.

5

proposal like this one is not rendered non-negotiable

6

simply because it mentions a reserved right.

7

Thus, a bargaining

Indeed, in a long line of decisional

8

precedent, the Authority has consistently found to be

9

negotiable proposals like the one in this case,

10

proposals that impose no substantive criteria of their

11

own making, but instead simply restate management's

12

obligation to act La accoriance with applicable laws.

13

QUESTION;

It is a little difficult to

14

conceive of a policy circular like this as being a law,

15

though, isn't it?

16

MS. PETE33*

WelL , I would note that it was

17

published for notice and comment in the Federal

18

Register, and that even Petitioner would have it be a

19

rule or regulation wichin the meaning of Section 7117.

I think

21

it is somewhat conceptually difficult to think of this

circular as being a law.

not, because management retains the right and there are

subject to judicial review in the courts of appeals.

First of all, if they were correct about that

acknowledged that those subjects are grievable.

Furthermore,

expressly says that it is subject to procedures and

And of course, the legislative history

11

certainly indicates that that section of the statute is

meant only to prohibit bargaining in certain respects

13

and it does net treat the grievability of matters.

14

Petitioner now also makes.the argument ro this

15

Court that, even if it were somehow coming within the

16

grievance procedure, it nevertheless should be excluded

because contracting out let seminations bear only

Among these indications are the very terms of

the circular, which since 1979 has recognized the stake

in contracting out by providing them access to the

2

circular's appeals procedure for challenging cost

3

comparisons.

4

The circular, I would note, describes its

5

appeals procedure as a mechanism "intended to protect

6

the rights of all directly affected parties."

7

the circular provides that employees should be informed

8

about the undectalcLnj and the progress of cost studies,

9

and agency regulations, which also involve grievable

Moreover,

10

matters to the extent that they impose mandatory

11

criteria, agency regulation such as the Air Force and

12

Army regulations referenced in AFGE's bried have

13

specific provisions about employee and union involvement

14

in aspscts of the cost study.

15

And the circular its<If also addresses

16

arrangements for employees who are adversely affected by

17

the conversion to contract performance of services.

18

as I have noted before, the Office of Management and

19

Budget extended national consultation rights over the

20

circular to federal sector unions, and those are

21

extended with regard to laws, rules, or regulations --

support in the legislative history or the language.

3

to tna extent that private sector precedent provides an

appropriate analogy for our program, that law strongly

supports the status of contracting out as a condition of

employment and of Its susceptibility to the grievance
