I believe it’s essential for those claims --

General Clark, I would assume that

6

SR. CLARK *

7

In putting these claims in perspective,

Yes, Your Honor.

3

McCree*s basic complaint is that Witherspoon excludiblos

9

were barred from potential membership on the jury that

10

heard the guilt phase of his trial.

Factually, those

11

nine prospective jurors were excluded due to the

12

requirements cf two entirely neutral and unassailable

13

features of Arkansas state law.

14

The first feature is the state of Arkansas has

15

determined that in criminal cases the issue cf guilt and

16

innocence should be

believe that the jury acts as a safeguard, if you will,

18

in the criminal justice establishment between the

19

defendant and that establishmentv that the policy and

21

st^te for more than seven decades.

2

included the penalty of death.

QUESTION;

General Clark, may I inquire about

this matter?

after the state had excused these jurors for cause under

Witherspoon,

8

Does it make any difference here that,

that it later waived its request for the

QUESTION;

Your Honor, I don't think that it
The stata has -Does that leave open for

11

manipulation ty the state in a given case an option to

12

excuse jurors under Witherspoon and then plan all along

13

to waive a request for the death penalty?

14

MR. CLARK;

Your Honor, I don’t think it was

15

the intent of the state to leave open an option to

16

procedurally come back and attempt to bar this effort.

17

The state of

18

inmates on death row and 146 other persons who were

19

charged with

offense, the need to determine factually whether the

21

assertions of McCrse are constitutional, and what we

22

will he facino if in fact this Court affirms the

23

decision of the court below .

24
25

Arkansas fares this fart;

With some 27

a capital offense but got some lesser

And so in the waiver of that procedure which
we waived, and I admit that to this Court, we thought we

had a chance to get at the essence of the merits of this

2

issue and get soma iirection from this Court as to where

3

we should go as a matter of policy.

4

QUESTION:

But does the record disclose in

5

this case why the state opted to proceed as it did and

6

forego reguesting the death

embarking on that course?

Your Honor, the answer to that

question is yes, that in this instance, as with Grigsby

10

in the case that was a companion case, that they were

11

consolidated

— ani

12

Grigsby died

while ha was in prison — that in this

13

instance what we did was we waived this issue because of

14

the fact that, as I said, *T e wanted to get to the crux

15

of the issue before the Coiirt.
QUESTION:

16

as the Court may be aware, Mr.

I 1onvt think that responds to my

17

question.

My concern is that is I understand this case

18

the state proceeded

19

on the premise that it was going to ask the death

20

penalty.

21

MR. CLARK:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

initially when it empaneled a jury

Yes, Your Honor.
And it excused for cause some

jurors under the Witherspoon doctrine, right?
MR. CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor.

We excused those

who said they would not follow state law.

Clearly,

to an impartial jury based in the

Sixth and the Fourteenth Amendments can be defined best

succinctly, I think, as the right to have one's case

and of the instructions of the court.

to serve, is that they stated they were willing to

consider the full range of punishments in this case,

4

which included the death penalty.

5

6

justified does not establish that those jurors in

7

decree's case are incapable of rendering an impartial

8

verdict.

9

The fact that the

To the contrary, there is a presumption of

10

impartiality which attaches to HcCrae and to YcCree's

11

jurors in particular, which arises, one, from the trial

12

court's determination that they were gualified to sit;

13

and two, from their stated oath they would follow state

14

law.

15

QUESTION*

hr. Clark, doesn't your argument

16

prove too much?

17

for example,

18

you could prove all the Republicans were perfectly

19

impartial.

20

Sjpoosing they excluded all Democrats,

and left just nothing but Republicans, and

«fould that be permissible?
YR. CLARK*

Your Honor, if in fact you were

21

trying to exclude these and

22

a cross-section because they were a distinct group and

23

th^y were recognizable and they were sizable and they

24

were systematically excluded, perhaps you would be

25

moving toward that argument, which t will address later

identify them as a denial of

in my argument to this Court.
Eut in tnis instance what McCree has said and

2
3

the Eighth Circuit sort of merged was tne impartiality

4

and the cross-section violation.

5

record that demonstrates that McCree's jurors were

6

anything other than impartial.

7

QUESTIONS

Well,

There's nothing in the

I understand that.

But in my

8

hypothetical, if you had nothing left hut Republicans

9

would that be permissible?

10

MR. CLARK*

Say they're all impartial.

If in fact in qualifying these

11

jurors they were excused because they were going to be

partial —

(202) 628-9300

1

studies, not that the jury panel was in fact biased or

2

not impartial, but that it was a procedure by which

3

state is more likely to obtain a jury which will vote

4

for a guilty verdict.
I thought that was the thrust of their

5
6

the

argument.

7

HR. CLARK*

Well, Your Honor, if that is the

8

thrust, I would look at it from this standpoint.

The

9

procedure is that of a unitary system, a unitary jury,

10

one that determines both guilt and penalty.

11

policy of the state of Arkansas, founded in this state

12

interest, th3t we believe that same jury should consider

13

guilt and innocence as well as penalty, for we believe

14

that in fact it acts as a safeguard, as a check, if you

15

will,

16

It is the

against that ctiminal justice establishment.
QUESTION*

Well,

that leads to the question of

17

whether the state’s interest, which of course is

18

substantial,

19

interest in having i fair procedure*.

20

is more substantial than

MR. CLARK*

.he defendant’s

I submit to this Court that is.

21

But in taking the procedural argument one step further,

22

what McCree dees argue, Your Honor, is in fact that the

23

policy in Arkansas is not goodpolicy:

24

this policy of the unitary jury.

25

as, there is a constitutional violation in this process,

We don’t like

Tha* is not the same

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F St, N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

and it’s clearly distinguishable.

2

If Mr. HcCree wants the policy changed, his

3

proper forum is the Arkansas legislature in changing

4

that policy.

5

interest that we determine that we want to protect first

6

and foremost is that we believe that jury does act as

7

that safeguard in that criminal justice establishment

8

and it is important that the same jury hear guilt and

9

punishment so as not to diminish their responsibility as

But in regard to the procedure, the state

10

a juror, so that one juror sitting only in the guilt

11

phase says, I am absolved of all concern and

12

responsibility as to penalty because I am net affected

13

in terms of making that derision, or the reverse if you

14

were the penalty jury.

15

And for those reasons, as well as reasons of

16

economy and efficiency, but the first one is that state

17

interest.

18

*cCree's assertions to this Court, as to the mere

19

existence -- the issue as to the mere existence of any

20

predilection or notion or concern by defendants in

21

general, without some ether objective criteria, is to

22

establish a standard that allows them to be excluded

23

because of their predilection or their notion, allows

24

them to be excluded, is tc establish an impossible

That is the jury that Mr. ScCree received.

The jury that Mr. dclree is asking for is net any

that this practice exists and few states have jury

Second, not only is there no evidence that

MR. CLARK*

Your Honor, I submit that when

12

they argue that they have a constitutional claim, their

13

constitutional claim that's described by the

14

Constitution is to an impartial jury.

15

QUESTION;

16

MR. CLARKi

Rigat.
In this instance, by the process

17

that we follow we only exclude those jurors who say they

18

cannot follow state law..

19

one of the nine excluded, said, I can follow state law,

20

we could not have excused him for cause.

21

doesn't show they said that. Your Honor.

QUESTION*

Had one of McCree's jurors,

The record

Yes, but you're recusing them from

23

the portion of the proceeding in which they admittedly

24

can follow state law, because they cannot follow state

25

law in a later proceeding in which they admit they

MR. CLARK:

He are excusing them for that

reason# Your Honor# and we do that because we think that

jury deliberation is the better policy, rather than

judge sentencing.

QUESTION;

General, in this case did the

Government use up all its peremptories?
MB. CLARK:

Your Honor, I’m not aware of

whether we did or not.

I believe we did.

There are ten

10

for the Government in a capital case and twelve for the

11

defendant, and I believe that we did.

QUESTION;

MR. CLARK:

You believe they did use them up?

sorry. Your Honor.

QUESTION:

You 'did not?

MR. CLARK;

We did not.

One other point I would like —

QUESTION;

I'm

Was the voir dire conducted

individually?
MR. CLARK:

Yes, Your Honor.

First the court

21

inquired, and the record I think indicates that six

22

jurors immediately identified, because of their belief

23

on the death penalty,

24

and were excused.

25

they could not follow state law

The three others that were excused were

identified because they could not follow state law and

2

because at least two of those three had some

relationship or familiarity with tne detendant, which

caused the state to be concerned about their

objectivity.

would like to make to this

Court —
QUESTIONS

I suppose if you had a rule that

16

you cannot thro.w off Witherspoon excludibles, you cannot

17

exclude them from the guilt or innocence phase, you

18

would just -- you would fiid out if they were opposed to

19

the death penalty, bu_ then seat them.

20

could, whan you hid

21

jurors, you would aid some alternates.

Tour Honor, I think, that procedure

perhaps could be advanced.
QUESTIONS

I guess we just wouldn't know how

many alternates you would have had to have on that basis

in this case
NR. CLARK*

We would not have known, Tour

Honor, that's correct.

4

QUESTION*

5

MR. CLARK*

6

The other point I would make to this Court is

We don't know now.
No, that's right.

7

that there's a division in the legal community among

8

prosecutors as to whether death qualifying a jury makes

9

them conviction prone.

There is evidence in the record

10

from prosecutors in Arkansas that disagree with others

11

as to the effect that qualifying a jury has in terms of

12

their indication of adjudication of a verdict of guilt

13

and innocence.

14

And finaLly, that if the state is not allowed

15

to voir dire cn the issue of death, as the question

16

asked, then we are facing a jury that cannot he

17

impartial to the state because of the potential of

1o

nullifiers, those very persons who, because of their

19

opinion of the penalty of death, would vote for an

20

adjudication of innocence rather than guilt, even though

21

the state met its burden.

22
23

Si
25

For all those reasons, I would ask that the
decision below be reversed.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER*
