explain, that the threat that disciplinary committee

members might be sued for damages in their personal

capacity on the basis of their service on these

10

committees, tc do just that would skew the results of

11

these hearings and therefore would weaken prison

12

discipline and security, and for that reason we have

13

sought certiorari in this case.

14

The facts here can be briefly stated.

In

15

January 1975 there was a two-day strike hy inmates at

16

the Terre Haute prison.

17

respondents in this case, Saxner and Cain who were

18

inmates at Terre Haute, were charged with encouraging

19

prisoners to engage in another work steppage.

20

A few weeks later the

These charges were heard before prison IDC on

21

February 21, 1975.

22

unfortunately for them, were the three petitioners in

23

this case, Cleavinger, Marcadis and Lockett.

24

hearing testimony and looking at the documentary

25

evidence, the IDC found respondents guilty cf

encouraging this work stoppage.

2

In addition, based on the evidence that had

3

been introduced at the hearing, the IDC fcund the

4

respondents had also committed another violation of

5

prison rules, possession of contraband, on the basis of

6

certain materials advocating the formation of a

7

prisoners* labor union that had been found in their

8

cells.

9

The Discipline Committee ordered that

10

respondents be placed in administrative segregation and

11

that they forfeit some of their good time.

12

Cain appealed this decision to the prison warden, who

13

gave them virtually all of the relief that they had

requested.

Saxner and

administrative appeals process by appealing tc the

20

Regional Director of the Bureau of Prisons who in April

21

1975 gave them the rest of the relief that they had

22

requested.

He ordered that their records be expunged.

23

Respondents were still not satisfied, so they

24

brought this Bivens action against the three members cf

25

their Discipline Committee, alleging that petitioners

The

only question we sought certiorari on is the absolute

17

I might also add, although it's also not here,

18

that the jury was incorrectly instructed on qualified

immunity under this Court's subsequent decision in

Harlow.

Now, the framework for analyzing the absolute
immunity issue in this case is —

Is there a provision for the

government paying the damages?

HR. GELLER;

There is not.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION;

2

MR. GELLERi

3
4

There is not?
The framework, ve think, for

analyzing the absolute immunity issue in this case is
rather clear in light of this Court's trior decisions.

5

In Butz against Economou the Court held that most

6

Executive Branch officials charged with constitutional

7

violations enjoy only a qualified immunity from damages

8

liability.

9

The Court held that there are certain

10

government officials whose special functions require a

11

full exemption from damages liability in the public

12

interest, and in a number of cases since Butz the Court

13

has wrestled with the question, whether this particular

14

function or that required a full exemption from damages,

15

liability, prosecutors or witnesses in judicial

16

proceedings, or the President of the United States.

17

But this case, we think, is quite different,

18

from all of these previous cases in a rather fundamental

19

way, and that's because this Court has already held in

20

cases stretching back more than a century that one

21

function of government that does require a full

22

exemption from damages liability in the public interest

23

is the adjudicatory function, and the Court has also

24

held in many cases that ev?n Executive Branch officials

25

who don't hold the rank or title or Judge, such as
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Administrative Hearing Officers, are nonetheless

2

entitled to quasi-judicial immunity if what they’re

3

engaged in are adjudicatory functions that are

4

comparable to 'that of a judge.

5

The test that we think emerges from these
\

6

cases, principally Butz against Economcu, is the

7

following:

8

quasi-judicia 1 immunity if, first, his role is

9

functionally comparable to that of a judge; second,

a governaent official is entitled to

the

10

controversies that he resolves are such as to lead tc

11

harassing or retaliatory litigation that would chill the

12

proper performance of those adjudicatory duties;

13

finally, that the adjudicatory system contains other

14

safeguards to avoid or correct constitutional violations

15

if they should occur.

16

and

We think that if that test is applied to this

17

case,

18

Executive officials whose job it is to adjudicate prison

19

disciplinary charges at these hearings have tc be

20

afforded absolutely immunity from damages liability in

21

suits brought by disgruntled inmates if this important-

22

governmental function is to be performed properly.

23

the result that follows inevitably is that

As to the first factor announced in Butz, the

24

record, we think, shows beyond doubt that the

MR. GELLER:

I think if what the guard was

doing is what these IDG members do, that the immunity

would attach just the same, but that would relate more

to that I will explain that one of the facts of this

officials of the prison who do not have day to day

McDonald, and in all of these systems there is the same

25

would be yes, but we are primarily concerned with what

9

is our prime concern, and we think it would have a

That

10

drastic effect on the operation of the federal

11

disciplinary system because of the way it's structured

12

to have the threat of damages liability hanging over the

13

heads of these decision makers.

14

QUESTION;

The reason I asked, of course, is

15

as Justice Marshall suggests, supposing a state system

16

as a routine matter used guards at the trial level but

17

had an appellate review system, you would still say the

18

immunity —

19

MR. GELLER:

I would make the same — I would

20

make the same argument, but that's not the case in the

21

federal system, and of course whatever system the State

22

set up would have to satisfy the due process clause as

23

construed in cases like Wolff.

Yes.

that sense, but I would suggest that in many ways that

makes them more subject to the threat cf harassing or

process where I think a litigant really has no reason to

14

expect that he lost before a judge because the judge was

hostile to him personally, the unfortunate reality is

16

that in the prison disciplinary proceedings many inmates

17

do feel that they lost solely because the beard was

hostile to them, or was biased or committed some act of

19

misconduct, and we think that the inmates who lose at

20

these IDC hearings would therefore often like to strike

21

back in some way.

22

Now, the Court said, in Wolff against

23

McDonald, and I quote, it said, "Retaliation" — they

24

are talking about retaliation by prisoners resentful of

25

disciplinary hearings.

The Court said, "Retaliation is

MR. GELLER*

Well, I asked -- there's nothing

13

in the record, obviously, but I asked the Bureau of

14

Prisons recently and they told me there are

15

approximately 75 pending Bivens suits by prisoners.

16

I should add, and that may seem like an

17

insubstantial number, it doesn't seem that way to me,

18

hut there is every reason to expect that if this Court

19

were to affirm — I mean, right now there is some

20

uncertainty about whether these sorts of suits can

21

proceed.

22

Disciplinary Committee members have absolute immunity.

23

A number of District Courts have held that.

24
25

The Fourth Circuit en banc has held that

I think if this Court were tc affirm, we would
see a drastic rise in that.

Now, finally, let me get to the third factor

protection of constitutional rights by the inmates

without the need for Bivens actions.

hearing officers, what they should do is incorporate

2

into the disciplinary system precisely those trial-type

3

features that exist in court, or that exist in

4

administrative proceedings.

5

But I think, this shows the fatal flaw in

6

respondent's argument, because this Court, in Wolff

7

against McDonald, said that the due process clause does

8

not require those sorts of proceedings, and the Court

9

didn’t say that in an offhand or cavalier manner.

10

What the Court did was carefully balance the

private rights involved versus the public interest in

maintaining prison security and discipline.

contention isn't

14

that due process requires it, but that if you're going

15

to give absolute immunity --

16

MR. GELLERi

I understand that.

I understand,

17

but the point I'm making is that if in order to gain

18

absolute immunity for these decision makers the Bureau

19

of Prisons would have to incorporate all these

20

trial-type procedures at the very same time that the

21

prison discipline and security that we are concerned

22

about in asking for absolute immunity would occur,

23

because if this Court refused to require those

24

procedures in Wolff against McDonald, basically they

25

would jeopardize prison security.

What about prosecutors?
Prosecutors get their immunity

21

from another branch of the quasi-judicial doctrine, and

22

that is because they are integrally involved in the

23

judicial process.

24

of that open judicial process.

MR. TAYLOR;

They're adversaries, that's true,

2

but th<=y got their immunity not because of their

3

adversarial position but their position in a judicial

4

process that's supervised by a judge.

5

We don't have that here.

6

QUESTION;

Isn't there a charging party?

7

Doesn't somebody actually make the charge in the prison

8

disciplinary hearings, and they give notice of the

9

charge ?

10

MR. TAYLOR;

11

QUESTION;

12

MR. TAYLOR;

That's right.
Who gives them -- who charges them?
A guard — it depends on the

13

factual situation, but a guard will bring an incident

14

report, which will then be served on the prisoner, who

15

will then come to the hearing after getting notice,

16

although that was one of the major problems in this case.

17

MR. TAYLOR;

In. what respect, did they say?
I can't swear to whether they

QUESTION;

So, what did you claim in that

trial, what the due process violation was?
MR. TAYLOR;

The due process violations that

22

we claimed were the fact that during the hearing itself

23

they brought two new charges which did not conform to

24

the evidence, did not give him any notice of them, and

proceeded to try him on it and convict him of it right
