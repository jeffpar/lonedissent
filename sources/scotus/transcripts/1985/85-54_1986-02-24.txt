OS BEHALF OF PETITIONERS

MR. ROTHFELDi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Courts
This case involves one narrow question,

10

whether Congress has waived the sovereign immunity of

11

the United States to permit the addition of pre-judgment

12

interest to Title VII attorneys’ fee awards against the

13

Federal Government.

14

In 1979, Respondent prevailed in his Title VII

15

action against his employer, the Library of Congress.

16

The district court indicated at the time that it would

17

award attorneys’ fee to Respondent as the prevailing

18

party, but it postponed entry of an order awarding those

19

fees, deciding to await the decision of the Court of

20

Appeals in a pending case, Copeland versus Marshall,

21

which was expected to provide guidance on the

22

calculation of a reasonable attorneys' fee.

23

The Court of Appeals handed down its decision

24

in Copeland almost a year later, in Sep‘ember 1980.

25

additional year then passed before the district court,

An

1

in November of

2

Respondent for work that his attorney had performed

3

three years earlier, in

4

1981, issued an order awarding fees to

1978 and early 1979.

In the part of the order that is specifically

5

at issue here,

the Court then added 30 percent on top of

6

the basic fee award, representing 10 percent for each

7

year of delay to compensate Respondent’s attorney for

8

the time that had passed between the date that he

9

completed his work and the time of the fee award.

10

A divided panel of the Court of Appeals

11

affirmed

12

pre-judgment interest on Respondent's attorneys’ fee.

13

In the Court of Appeals’ view, the Title VII attorneys’

14

fee provision specifically waiver that aspect of the

15

Government's sovereign immunity that traditionally has

16

shielded the United States from liability for interest.

claims against the Federal Government, interest cannot

be awarded on top of those claims unless Congress in

5

addition affirmatively considered the interest question

and expressly indicated that interest should be

available.
It has never been considered enough that the

8
9

substantive

statutory language could be read to support an award cf

10

interest or that maxing interest available might be

11

consistent with the statutory purpose.
QUESTION*

12

Hr. Rothfeld, if there were private

13

litigants involved in a case like this, so we didn’t

14

have the Federal Government issue, if some form of

15

pre-judgment interest were sought as against a private

16

defendant employer, would it be payable as pert of

17

attorneys’ fee, or as a part of damages in general, or

18

hew?

19

20
21

What’s the theory of the recovery against the
private litigant, do you think?
HR. ROTHFELD*

Pre-judgment interest on the

22

attorneys’ fee award would be characterized, I think,

23

either as a component of that award — pre-judgment

24

interest I think is generally viewed as a part of the

25

damages and is generally termed pre-judgment interest on

the damages.
QUESTION*

So if it were a private defendant,

3

in your view then it would be a part of attorneys* fee

4

or costs in any event?

5

MR. R OTHFELD t

6

QUESTION*

7

MR. RQTHFELD:

Well, it would —

Is that right?
It would be a part of the

8

attorneys* fee.

It would be interest — it's somewhat

9

complicated, because the Title VII attorneys* fee

10

provision defines the attorneys* fee as a part of the

11

costs, and interest is generally not — pra-judgmant

12

interest is generally not awarded on costs.

13

But in our view, the pre-judgment interest

14

would be awarded on tbo attorneys* fee, which would then

15

be awarded as an element of the costs.

16

QUESTION*

Is it conceded all around that in

17

the case of a private defendant pre-judgment interest

18

can be recovered on attorneys* fee;?

19

MR. ROTfcFELD*

We acknowledge that

district

20

court can exercise its discretion to award pre-judgment

21

interest on attorneys' fee in private sector

22

litigation.

23

QUESTION;

24

MR. ROTHFELD;

25

As part of the attorneys* fee?
As a part of the attorneys*

fee, that’s correct.

QUESTION:

Not as a part of damages?

2

MR. ROTHFELDi

That's correct, not as a part

3

of the substantive back pay award, for example, that a

4

plaintiff might be entitled to get.
So what we think is determinative here is this

5

6

no interest rule which applies specifically to suits

7

against the Federal Government, the sovereign immunity

8

rule.

9

force for the better part of 200 years.

And this rule has been applied with undiminished
Early in the

10

ninteenth century, it already was the usual practice cf

11

executive agencies not to pay interest on claims against

12

the United States unless expressly directed to do so by

13

Congress.

14

And in the years since then, this Court has

15

repeatedly applied the no interest rule to bar claims

16

for interest against the United States in literally

17

dozens of decisions.

18

situations that are not applicable here, principally

19

claims involving constitional takings, the Court has

20

applied the no interest rule to virtually every

21

imaginable setting, in cases involving pre- and

22

post-judgment interest, cases involving liquidated

23

claims and unliquidated claims, cases involving statutes

24

and contracts.

25

With the exception of narrow

without hesitation in cases in which the statutory

2

language directed the Units! States to pay just

3

compensation or full equitable relief, or other language

4

that undoubtedly would make a private party liable for

5

interest in the same circumstances.

6

Given all this, the rule is considerably mere

7

than a simple canon of construction.

8

that has been applied consistently by this Court and by

9

the lower Courts and by executive agencies for well over

As a principle

10

a century, the rule has taken on an institutional

11

significance as something that tells Congress what it

12

must do when it thinks it appropriate to make interest

13

available against the Federal Government.

14

There is little doubt that Congress is aware

15

of the rule and has legislated lith the rule in mini.

16

When it has wanted interest to be available against the

17

United States, Congress has said so expressly, and it

18

has set out the circumstances ;.n which interest should

19

be paid with great specificity, setting out the rates at

20

which it should be paid, what a plaintiff just do to

21

protect his right to collect, and generally the

22

conditions under which interest will be awarded.

23

It is against this background of consistent

24

interpretation and action by the Court and by Congress

25

that Respondent's claim for attorneys'

fee under Title

13

In the Court of Appeals' view, this lang uage,

14

the "same as a private person" proviso, must have

15

manifested Congress' clear intent to waive every a spec t

16

of the Government's sovereign immunity, necessarii y

17

20

involves what the Court believed the statutory lan guage

21

to mean, the "same as a private person" proviso,

fact. Congress placed that language in the statute not

23

in an attempt to waive immunity in some complete v ay ,

25

liable as a Title VII defendant at all.

As this Court, however, has held time and

7

again in its no interest rule decisions, this sort of

8

threshold undifferentiated waiver of sovereign immunity

9

is simply not enough to make the United States liable

10

for an award of interest.

what the position of the Government was when Attorney

I had the impression from reading this that there’d

probably bean a change in the Government’s position, but

17

maybe I’m wrong.

18

MR. ROTHFELD*

Well, to my knowledge the first

19

suggestion that attorneys' fees would be available,

20

interest would be available on attorneys’ fees against

21

the Government, did not occur until 198D in this

22

Copeland versus Marshall decision.

23

there was no litigation about the matter prior to that

24

time, at the time that the memorandum had been issued.

25

So I think that

The only interest litigation, as I said,

2

plaintiffs were entitled to their interest.

area, the United Slates consistently has taken the

4

position, successfully I should add, that plaintiffs

5

cannot obtain interest on their back pay awards.

6

So I

find in that

think that that has been the consistent

7

position, and emphasizes the distinction that we draw

8

between interest and an underlying award.

13

that's not an area of the law that I am completely

familiar with.

15

rationale was that the purpose of the attorneys* fees

to post-judgment interest on attorneys* fees, does the

post-judgment interest isn’t available against the

The usual approach,

the usual distinction

between pre- and post-judgment interest is that

Justice O’Connor, as an element of the damages, without

1

a specific statutory authorization, except when the

2

United States is a party.

3

Post-judgment interest has alvay„ been treated

4

as something which is awarded separately by statute, and

5

there are a host of feieral statutes that address the

6

availability, none of which make the United States

7

liable for post-judgment interest on Title VII

8

attorneys’ fees.

9

The United States was made liable as a Title

10

VII defenaant generally through the Equal Employment

11

Opportunity Act of 1972, which essentially extended the

12

existing provisions of Title VII to suits against the

13

Unite! States.

14

combination with the basic attorneys’ fees prevision in

15

Section 2000(e)(5 ) (K),

16

sovereign immunity and makes it liable for attorneys’

17

fees awards at all to Title VII plaintiffs such as

18

Respondent.

19

It is that 1972 enactment, in

that waives the 5overnment*s

The fact that Section 2000(e)(5)(K)

already

20

contains the "same as a private person" proviso upon

21

which the Court of Appeals primarily relied is a

22

fortuity that really has no application here.

23

language certainly was not intended to waive the

24

Government’s immunity in some sort of unusually complete

25

way, as the Court of Appeals believed.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And that

1

This leads to a second and more basic problem

2

with the Court of Appeals’ approach as viewed against

3

the background of this no interest rule.

4

Equal Employment Opportunity Act of

5

matter nothing in the 1964 version of Title VII, even

6

reading that version as the Court of Appeals did, meets

7

the test of clarity that this Court has set out in its

8

repeats! decisions applying this no interest rule.

9

Nothing in the

1972 , for that

Title VII obviously does not mention interest

10

on its face, let alone set out circumstances in which

11

interest should be paid.

12

history of the attorneys' fees prevision, either in 1964

13

or the 1972 provisions that applied the

14

the Federal Government,

15

nothing in the broader and more general history or

16

background of Title VII contains anything which is

17

helpful to Respondent here, and that background sets

18

out, as I think Attorney General Ball suggested in his

19

memorandum, that Congress intended to remove sovereign

20

immunity as a bar to federal employee plaintiffs

21

bringing their claims of discrimination to court, and

22

that background shows that Congress intended generally

23

that tha same types of relief be available to federal

24

employee plaintiffs as to their private sector

25

counterparts.

Nothing in the legislative

*64 version to

adverts to interest at all.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

And

But again, as this Court has consistently held

1

2

in cases interpreting the no interest rule, whatever

3

ether forms of relief Congr-ss has authorized, the

4

question whether interest will be available on that

5

relief presents a separate inquiry to sovereign immunity

6

that must be resolved by reference to the no interest

7

rule.
It is for this reason,

8
9

as I mentioned earlier,

that the Court of Appeals have uniformly ruled that

10

Title VII plaintiffs cannot obtain interest on their

11

back pay awards against the Government.

12

give any attention to the question, it is impossible to

believe that it would have chosen to provide mere

favorable treatment to Title VII

The Court of Appeals decision, which finds a

waiver of the no interest rule in a case where Congress

failed to address the interest question and adepts an

essentially ad hoc approach to the circumstances under

area that Congress obviously believed to be governed by

very precise rules.

effect after the fact, by finding interest available

MR. RALSTON*

Hr. Chief Justice and may it

He agree that this case does present a single

issue.

2

the Government does, and that is it is whether a

3

reasonable attorneys* fees award against a federal

4

agency in a Title VII action may include compensation

5

for delay in payment between the time services are

6

rendered and the time of the award.

We would state it a little bit differently than

7

The Government sees the entire case as

8

dependent upon whether the word "interest" can be found

9

in the attorneys* fees statute or anyplace in Title VII,

10

or perhaps in its legislative history.

11

this word anywhere, Petitioners simply rely on a series

12

of decisions based on early opinions of the Attorney

13

General and codified not in 28 U.S.C. Section 2516, to

14

the effect that, because of sovereign immunity, interest

15

is not awardable against the Government in the absence

16

of a statute.

17

And net finding

The Government then equates any adjustment in

18

fees to compensate for delay in payment with interest.

19

Therefore, according to the Government,

20

adjustment may be made in calculating either a

21

reasonable attorneys* fees, what constitutes a

22

reasonable fee under the statute, or in calculating back

23

pay which is intended to make a discriminated against

suffered.

purposes of Title VII and Congress* intent in making

12

Title VII applicable to the Federal Government in 1972.

comes from the language of the statute and Congressional

the purpose the Congress had when it enacted the *72 Act

it also enlarged and clarified the powers of the Civil

in tha Act — at the administrative level, these

agencies have the power to grant any relief necessary to

13

Indeed, at the same time Congress was making

expanding the remedial provisions of Title VII to make

In answering the question in this

MR. RALSTON;

Well,

Your Honor, I think, the

Court can address the issue of pre-judgment interest,
but I think it's helof.il in addressing that as to what
that involves.

And it's the two components that are

The Government doesn't really address the
issue of what do you do about inflation in calculating
the award, and pre-judgment interest really has two
components;

But we do say that

2

such a result would certainly support what the district

3

co'Ut did, because in fact, whatever it was called, it

4

did almost compensate us at least for the loss in value

5

of money.

It fell slightly short.
We might just point oat that the Court of

6
7

Appeals was also concerned with the district judge's

8

calculation, and indeed its order requires the district

9

judge to look again at the calculation,

because it was

10

concerned that the hourly rate it used already contained

11

a component for loss of value of money, and that we

12

shouldn’t get double billing for this factor, which we

13

agree with.
So no matter what happens — if the Court

14
15

adopts the Government's position, then that's the end of

16

it.

17

loss in value should be calculated in, this case will go

18

bac*- down to the district court anyway to determine if

19

that calculation was properly made and not double

20

billed.

But if it adopts the partial position that at least

23

don't believe the district judge deducted what the

What the district court said was, this is the

Now, the district court also iid, in part of

of a reverse Blum factor, I suppose it would best be

To

the extent that that use of current rates would be

designed to compensate for a change in the value of

MR. ROTHFELDi

A number of the Court of

11

MR. ROTHFELD;

13

whether or not there should be some difference in

14

treatment.

15

will have been adjusted simply because of delay, and

16

always articulated by the Court, it is that the United

17

States cannot be held Liable for a delay at all, and

1°

that gives rise to the application of the no interest

19

rule .

20

And certainly the value of the fee award

And that clearly, whether you're compensating

21

for a change in the value of the money or whatever other

22

element of the award is premised on passage of time,

23

that compensates for delay.

ME. ROTHFELDs

It was not put in those terms,

8

Your Honor.

It simply required a payment of full and

But the

13

MR. RCTHFELDi
