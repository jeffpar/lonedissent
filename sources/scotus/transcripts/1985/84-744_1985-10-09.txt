12

The language of Rule 52 refers to error which does not

14

MR. KUHLIK;

15

Yes.
Is it the government’s position

that misjoinder doas not affect substantial rights, or

17

that even if it does affect substantial rights, the

MR. KUHLIK;

Our position is not that joinder

your attention. Justice Stevens, is to affecting the

The inquiry is not whether a substantial right

That is the inquiry to be

undertaken in this specific case,, did

17

being the right to a jury verdict untainted by whatever

18

error took place.

QUESTION*

the misjoinder

In the McElroy case as I - ead it,

20

they said there was a substantial right affected, and

21

that for that reason it was reversible error.

22

MR. KUHLIKi

In the McElroy case, which was

23

decided in 1896, the Court responded to the government's

24

argument that the error of misjoinder in that case did

25

not affect the verdict by saying that they could not say
8

that the verdict wasn’t affected there

2

But I would note that the case was —

3

QuESTION:

4

The government confessed error in

that case.

5

MR. KUHLIK;

6

QUESTION;

They confessed error -They didn’t make that argument.

7

They agreed it did affect substantial rights, and they

8

agreed that as to some of the defendants it should be

9

revers ed.

10

MR. KUHLIK;

But the portion of the Court’s

11

discussion to which you are referring referred, I

12

believe, to the part of the judgment in which the

13

government had not confessed error, which was on the

14

basis of the fact that the three defendants who were

15

charged in all counts had not had their rights

16

affected.

17

And I would note that McElroy was decided ever

18

20 years before the first harmless error statute was

19

enacted.

20

QUESTION;

Yes, but Rule 52(a) expressly picks

21

up the substantial right language, and that is why I am

22

just not entirely — still not entirely clear what you

23

are saying.

24
25

You are saying that there is a substantial
right involved, but it is not affected if one can call

it harmless?

Is that It?

HR. KUHLIKi

2

Well, perhaps the best way to put

3

it is that the substantial right in any case is tne

4

right to a jury verdict that has not been affected by

5

error, and in that respect we would say that if there

6

has been misjoinder,

the substantial right which is to the untainted jury

12

interpretation,

14

"which does not affect substantial rights shall be

You are sa.ying if it is — that is the

16
17

HR. KUHLIKs

18

Exactly.

I mean,

that is -

what

19

the rule was called is the harmless error rule, and the

20

rule,

21

of the code, which does not have the substantial right

22

language, I believe.

i.

which is to be read of a piece with Section 2111

23

Well, Section 2111 was designed simply to make

24

sure that the harmless error rule applied on appeal, and

25

the Court — Congress, when it reenacted

that statute in

1

1948 specifically iil away with the technical modifier

2

on error.

3

Sc,

the point is that Congress has made it

4

clear both in the rale and in the statute, and this

5

Court has certainly made it clear in Chapman that the

6

harmless error inquiry is not limited to mere technical

7

defects.

8

constitutional, whether it is statutory,

9

violation of the criminal rules.

It applies whether the error is
whether it is a

That is all that we

10

ask here, is that this same inquiry be made with respect

11

to misjoinder.

12

And in that regard, the harmless error inquiry

13

serves several important purposes, principally the

14

prompt and fair administration of justice, and it gives

15

effect to the central purpose cf a criminal trial, which

16

is to determine the factual issue of the defendant's

17

guilt or innocence not to sew the seeds for reversible

18

error upon later review.

19

And these -- these considerations have special

20

force in the context of misjoinder, which is a fairly

21

common technical violation of the rules that often, as

22

we submit here, have an absolutely minimal effect on the

23

outcome of the trial.

24

Now, we do not believe that misjoinder can be

25

said to fit within any of the exceptions that the Court

22

MR. KDHLIKi

How will that earlier determina :ion under Rule

17

MR. KUHLIK;

Of course, the first inquiry for

19

Rule 8 was violated at all.

20

QUESTION;

21

MR. KUHLIK;

Let's assume it was, or is.
Hell, the — I think that the

22

District Court's determination that there was no

23

prejudice would be a factor of some moment, but it would

24

not be controlling, because at the time that the

25

District Court makes its Rule 14 determination, that is

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

would make the standard harmless error inquiry, which is

3

on the record developed at the trial itself.

4

QUESTION;

Rule 14 deals — isn't that the

5

situation where there is a proper joinder under Rule 8,

Is that right?

MR.KUHLIK;

Well, the showing of prejudice is

basically the same, but the burdens and the standards

Now, the elements of a mail fraud offense

Yes, and the reason that I say

Rule 8(b), and they have established standards, and they

20

say beyond this standard you shall not go, and they say

21

in effect that misjoinder is reversible.

22

There are numberless reasons to illustrate

this.

Now, let me say simply this in regards to

Hasting.

The reason we say Hastings dees not apply in

6

this case because Hastings is — Hasting is not a

misjoinder case, and we think that that is very

8

important, because all Hasting really did was to make a

9

global statement of general principles about the

10

harmless error doctrine, and Hasting itself recognizes

11

that there are certain categories of cases to which the

12

harmless error doctrine does not apply.
Counsel stated those, those that deny an

I believe it important to mention as one of

the Justices has the fact that there are two people

charged in this case, father and son, and when we are

22

talking about the question of harmless error, there are

23

evidentiary facts that make for differing

24

interpretations as to the relative guilt of these

25

individuals, and certainly as to the relative prejudice.

We know that Rule 8(b)

prevents the necessity

2

of a defense of a multiplicity of offenses, and we knew

3

that it also preserves the integrity of the factfinding

4

process.

5

Of course, the other side of that is the

6

argument that joinder promotes judicial economy, but we

7

believe that any benefit in this regard is outweighed by

8

the inherent prejudice of misjoinder.

9

I would like to talk with the Court briefly

10

about the government’s construction in its brief about

11

Rule 8(b) and 52(a), and we say that their argument for

12

the construction of Rule 52(a), the harmless error rule,

13

in application to all cases would simply eviserate Rule

8(b), because Rule 8(b) sets the limits, and says that

6

There were — I want to turn now to my

7

consideration of the second point, but before I do that,

8

I want to talk with the Court about the government's

9

contention that the misjoinder in this case could be

10

taken care of by considerations such as the overwhelming

11

weight of the evidence and the fact that much of the

12

evidence would be admissible in the trial of another

13

case upon remand, and their matters in regards to

14

retrial.
We think that an attempt to retry these

15
16

defendants together would again accentuate the inherent

17

prejudice that inurred to Dennis Lane by having this

18

particular Count 1 presented and evidence presented in

19

20

jury.

21

There are — I believe that one of the

22

Justices mentioned the possibility of error to the

23

need to consider here.

25

under Count 1 in this case obviously contributed to the

conviction of Dennis Lane on the other cases
Sow, the Count 1,

we need to remember,

related

3

to a fire over a year in advance of the fire alleged in

4

Counts 2, 3, and 4, and it was charged alcne against

5

J.C. Lane, who was the father of Dennis Lane.

6

you come along and consider the one charge against J.C.

7

Lane in the first count, Counts 2, 3, and 4 involve both

8

defendants, and Count 5 involved both defendants in a

9

conspiracy to commit arson for profit.

How, when

10

Now, if we had only Counts 2, 3, and 4, and we

11

had a father and son alone involved there, and one fire,

12

we might think that was an accidental catastrophe, but

13

if we add to that the Count 1 which relates alone to

14

J.C. Lane, then we have two fires involved in a single

15

family, and certainly a suspicion that this was not

16

accidental or the overpowering urge to consider that

17

there may be some connection..

18

And t!en when we add Count 5, which relates to

19

the conspiracy between father and son to carry out a

20

scheme for profit in Lubbock, Texas, we have evidence

21

there presented of three separate fires.

22

Now, there is danger to J.C. Lane in Count 1

23

because of the possibility of the jury saying here is a

24

father who not only did something himself, but he

25

involved his son in a later and still — a later

So, we think clearly the danger is evident in

2
3

Count 1 as to both of them,

4

Count 6 resulted in prejudice, we believe, tc J.C. Lane

5

because — and certainly to Dennis because Dennis is

6

charged with perjury, and he is charged with perjury

7

directly in relation to Count 5, which is the conpiracy

8

to commit arson in Lubbock, and in Counts 2 through 5 of

9

the indictment, in addition to alleging his own criminal

and then the misjoinder ol

10

activity, then J.C.

Lane is involved in arson with his

11

son, and then Count 6 in regard to perjury involves him

12

in perjury in relation to another count on conspiracy

13

where he is charged with his father.
And so there is a possibility fcr it to begin

14
15

to look like that father influenced son and the son is

16

supporting the father.

HR. BROWN:

9

I want to turn now to a consideration of our

Yes.

10

contention that the evidence is insufficient to support

11

the conviction on Count 2 through 4 of the indictment.

12

Now, the Article 18, USCA*s 1341, requires that the

13

government prove that the alleged use of the mails was

14

for the purpose of executing the scheme.

15

We cite fCahn versus U.S., which says that the

16

statute only reaches those instances in which the use of

17

the mails is in the execution of the fraud.

18

;negation is that in Counts 2, 3, and 4, which relate

19

to arson in regards to an address of 1105 South Jackson

20

in Amarillo, that the scheme had reached its fruition as

you have to deal with, and of course th*_ government

So all we would have to do,

then,

is to see whether there was sufficient evidence in the

record to at least support a finding of an intent to

and that would resolve this case.

We believe that the -- now,

mailing, and we think that the Court of Appeals actually

2

confused the foreseeability of mailing with the

preconceived intent to xull by the use of the mails»

4

Intent in this case is knowing and wilfully,

charged in the indictment.

intent, and knowing —

7

QUESTION;

The mens rea is criminal

Why do you say that?

I mean, the

8

government takes the position that the intent to defraud

9

is all the statute requires, and I think reading the

10

statute that is a pretty fair inference from it.

Why do

11

you think that intent to lull is a kind of a substantive

12

element of the crime rather than just something to

13

conform to the commerce requirement.

14

What I am saying is that I think the

15

government says intent to lull should make the

16

difference between that and

17

government is not arguing intent to defraud.

18

arguii g that there was a.i intent to lull when there is

19

no evidentiary basis for that.

QUESTION;

— in other words, that the
They are

I thought the government took the

21

position that intent to lull was not necessary so long

22

as the defendant’s conduct has the effect of lulling.

23

Do you disagree with that?

24
25

MB. BROWN;

I do not disagree with Your

Honor's interpretation of the government's argument,

no.

2

intent necessary must be present at the very time that

3

the defendant uses the mail or knowingly causes the use

4

of the mail.

5

But what we do say is this, that the fraudulent

Sow, Gibson versus — U.S. versus Gibson says

6

this, and we think that the Court of Appeals opinion

7

overlooks this basis,

8

intent to lull which was neither alleged nor proved, and

9

which was expressly disputed by Dennis Lane.

10

and the opinion in fact imputes an

In summary, because of my diminishing time, we

believe there is insufficient evidence of a-, intent tc

this kind of a case can neither be imputed to the

22

respondent nor can it be supplied by proof of the

Hr. Kuhlik, do you have anything further?

C/RAL ARGUMENT OF BRUCE NEIL KUHLIK, ESQ.,

4

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES - REBUTTAL

5

MR. KUHLIK:

6

First, Justice O’Connor asked me earlier about

Two points. Your Honor.

7

the effect of a District Court's finding that there was

8

not sufficient prejudice to require a severance under

9

Rule 14.

I would like to clarify that a greater amount

10

of prejudice could certainly be tolerated under Rule

14

11

than would be tolerated on a harmless error inquiry

12

under Rule 8, so that the District Court would have the

13

discretion to refuse to grant a severance under Rule 14

14

because the additional amount of prejudice would be

15

tolerable where that amount of prejudice would result in

16

a reversal under Pule 8 on appeal.
The second point is simply to emphasize that

17
18

under the mail fraud statute there is no separate crime

19

of lulling.

20

is simply one way that the mailing can further that

21

scheme .

The crime is a scheme to defraud.

22

If there is nothing further.
