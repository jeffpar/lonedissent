QUESTION;

I realize. Justice O'Connor —

And for the cause and prejudice

inquiry and the argument you are making,

4

us focus on the performance of counsel at the trial as a

whole, or would you concede that you have to focus on

6

this specific complaint, this one alleged error,

if it was ineffectiveness in that narrower focus only,

soma kind of clear failure to meet a reasonably competent

9

standard as to a single error?

10

MR. SLONAKERi

would you have

and ask

I am confused.

I believe you would look in both

11

cases at the whole performance, but the focus in each

12

instance would be on the specific default or defect or

13

deficiency of the attorney.

14

this might be the Stokes case, which we cite in our

15

opening brief, where the Supreme Court of Virginia found

16

that an attorney was ineffective for not raising a

17

Sandstrom defective instruction.

18

Now, that

19

performance overalL.

20

the Court would look to what issues he did raise, the

21

relevant merit,

22

You don't ignore what else was done, but the focus would

23

be on the particular deficiency as it would be in any

24

allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.

25

In this context, on appeal, surely

so it really wouldn't be in isolation.

But the standard — I mentioned the Stokes

MR. SLONAKER*

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, is I was saying at the luncheon break,

8

even if this Court accepts our position on the exhaustive

9

question, and we fervently hope the Court will,

10

acceptance of the Fourth Circuit's rule will pat enormous

11

pressure on the state courts to lower their standards, to

12

accept mere attorney error anl inadvertence as an excuse

13

for serious procedural defaults or face the alternative

14

of simply deferring the federal comt without providing

15

the federal court the benefit of either state factual

16

findings or the benefit of the state court's reasoning.

such defaults.

difficulties with the Fourth Circuit’s task is the fact

that this Court has recognized in numerous decisions

what has to be exhausted?

2

MR. SLDMAKER;

It is our position that he

3

should return to the state court to present his

4

allegation of cause that he suffered attorney deficiency.

5

Virginia recognizes ineffective assistance of counsel as

6

causa for that deficiency.

7

QUESTION;

I know, but the Court of Appeals

8

hera said it didn’t have to be ineffective assistance of

9

counsel, right?

10

HR. SLONAKER;

That is true, but this is the

11

problem with not requiring exhaustion.

12

he could always bypass the state court, because if he

13

can’t show mere attorney error, he certainly can’t show

14

ineffective assistance of counsel.

15

going to hava a bypass of the stata system,

16

type of cause is specifically recognized under state law,

17

so that there wouldn't even be a default,

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW L. FPEY, ESQ.,

3

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES

4

Mr. Frey.

AS AMICUS C33IAE IN SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. FREY*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

6

the Court, I would like to begin by describing what our

7

position is with respect to attorney oversights.

8
9

Our position is not that attorney oversight can
under some circumstaicas be cause.

Our position is that

10

if the defendant is alleging attorney error as a basis

11

for relief, he must satisfy

12

assistance of counsel.

13

believe, applies to something external to the defense,

14

something, an cut sid e circamstance that has justified the

15

defendant's fa:.lure to raise or preserve his claim.

16

the Strickland ineffective

The cause and prejudice test, we

Now, this loes not mean, contrary to the

17

suggestion that I think the ACLU and respondent have made

18

that nothing can be cause under the cause and prejudice

19

test.

20

situations where the court may refuse to allow a motion

21

or objection to be male.

22

unreasonably conditions or interferes with the ability to

23

make or preserve a claim, or in the more common situation

24

there will be an inability to discover through reasonable

25

diligence the factual or legal basis for the claim at the

Quite the contrary.

First of all, there are

The state may have a rule which

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

time when the rules call for it to be made

2

Now, an example of that is the Unite! States

3

against Henry, a Hessiah case this Court decided a few

4

years ago in which the Messiah claim was raised for the

5

first time in collateral attack.

6

that there was a procedural default in failing to raise

7

at a trial, because the fact that the cellmate was a

8

government informant was unknown prior to trial.

9

e did not argue there

Now, so our position is that in order to get

10

relief on the basis of a claim which was procedarally

11

defaulted at trial or on appeal on the basis of attorney

12

error the defendant must satisfy the Strickland

13

ineffective assistance of counsel standard.

14

Now, what are the alternatives to this

15

position?

16

against Noia and in Justice Brennan's dissent in

17

Wainwright against Sykes.

18

default should bar a claim only if the defendant is

19

somehow personally responsible for it, and this view is

20

based on the notion that it is not fair to hold the

21

client responsible for the errors of his attorney.

22

Dne alternative was the view expressed in Fay

find that is that a procedural

Now, under this view, procedural defaults would

23

rarely be enforced, but I think there is little question

24

that this view was rejected by the Court in Wainwright

25

and again rejected in Engel.
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Now, what has happened in this case is a search

2

for an intermediate position by the Court of Appeals, and

3

under this position as I understand it the client’s

4

personal waiver is not required, but he is still not to

5

be bouni by his lawyer's action unless in effect the

6

lawyer deliberately waived the right by choosing not to

7

raise an issue of which the lawyer was aware.

8
9

Now, it seems to me there are several reasons
for rejecting this effort.

First of all, T think it is

10

quite clear that tiis can’t be squared with Engel.

11

is language in Engel versus Isaacs that unequivocally

12

talks about the lawyer overlooking a claim,

13

unawareness of the claim, and makes it quite clear that

14

that is not cause to excuse a procedural default.

15

Now, there is another problem.

There

the lawyer’s

I am not sure

16

that I totally understand what the Fourth Circuit’s test

17

is.

18

is that the lawyer in his assignment of error listed

19

everything he could think of, and then when he got around

20

to preparing the petition for appeal, selected from among

21

those things the issues that were thought most likely to

22

gain the attention of the Virginia Supreme Court,

23

discarding others.

24
25

It seems to me clear in this case that what happened

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals here
reversed, and in fact it suggested that almost surely
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F Si., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

this was the kind of attorney error that would constitute

2

cause, but it did sand it back for a hearing.

3

is the situation in the rase where the attorney considers

4

he is aware of the potential existence of a claim but

5

decides that it is not sufficiently meritorious to be

6

pressed?

7

to be a waiver ofthe claim

8

waiver of the claim?

9

Now, what

Is that infer the Fourth Circuit’s test going
, or is it not going to be a

Now, if that is going to be an excusable

10

default in that case where a legal error causes the

11

lawyer to choose not to press a claim, then we will be

12

back essentially to Fay against Noia, and the cause and

13

prejudice standard of Wainwright will be pretty much

14

wiped out in any case where the lawyer has failed to

15

preserve the claim.

16

I don’t

think the Fourth Circuit meant to go

17

that far.I think what

18

was, well, if the lawyer doesn’t realize the claim

exists, that is caase.

20

21

it, that is not cause.

22

the Fourth Circuit meant to say

think the Strickland standard looks to the subjective

that one of the problems with the Fourth Circuit standard

can you answer with out know ing what the Jenks Act
material is, or how can you answer this question without

there is no point in worryi ng about whether there is a

Court, the issue before this Court is really quite a

The Fourth Circuit's decision is really much

The issua that was stated by the Fourth

(202) 628-9300

After

1

reviewing a series of cases, the Fourth Circuit said,

2

from these authorities we conclude that attorney error

3

short of wholesale ineffectiveness of counsel can

4

constitute Wainwright cause.

5

Now, I would like to posit ani emphasize that

6

word "wholesale," that under the Sixth Amendment, we are

7

looking, as Justice O'Connor pointed out, to the overall

8

performance in the case.

9

we are looking at the one default to see whether it met

10

11

Sere, the Fourth Circuit said

the performance test of Strickland.
The Court goes on.

A procedural default is

12

excused not when counsel reasonably but incorrectly

13

exercised his judgment, but when through ignorance or

14

oversight he fails to exercise :\t at all in dereliction

15

of the duty to represent her client.

16

This is what we mean by attorney error.

I

17

suggest that the Fourth Circuit in trying to find the

18

midground to which 1 r. Frey ref erred found a very narrow

19

one that preserves the concept of cause under Wainwright

20

versus Sykes as applied to attorney conduct or

21

misconduct.
