ORAL ARGUMENT OF MORRIS K. SCHNITZER, ESC.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MR. SCHNITZER;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

it please the Court;

10

My clients, the plaintiffs and the petitioners

11

in this Court, sued over a libel against them which was

12

published in Fortune magazine.

13

only days before the one-year defamation limitation

14

statute in New Jersey which dates from publication.

The complaint was filed

The defendant was described meticucusly in the

complaint.

18

one sueable entity fitted that description and that

19

It was a foreign corporation and the

The difficulty was that the plaintiff used

Fortune as the name applied

to and appropriately

described defendant.

unerringly, arriving at the registered agent in New

24

Jersey for Time Inc.

its duty appropriately and delivered the summons and

complaint to the executive suite at Time Inc., and there

2

in fairly — I would think, instantaneously

3

self-recognition took over and it was understood at once

4

that the plaintiff had made some kind of an error.
St that point, with hindsight, I think it also

5

6

clear that the decision warned in the executive suite,

7

and that is not to get entangled with the merits,

8

instead to prevail on the law,

9

procedure.

10

and

that is, the law of

What happened was that as the plaintiff

11

understood the error and learned and confirmed, I might

12

add, that the papers arrived at Time headquarters about

13

four days, certainly no longer, after the last hour of

14

the statute of limitations period.

15

undertook to amend, to install Time Inc. as the

16

defendant in the action, and at that stage the defendant

17

implemented its resolve to concentrate on the procedure

18

and moved for a summary judgment.

19

The plaintiff

The defendant prevailed twice, once in the

20

district court and again in the court of appeals.

21

issue is Rule 15-C, the second summons.

22

second summons because it focuses so squarely on party

23

amendments, of pleadings that must be taken to be the

24

rule that governs, and it was certainly the one on which

25

the courts below concentrated.

4

"changing" and "the."

5

requirements first, that the person to be brought in,

6

the defendant to be brought in, must have had notice of

7

the pending action, secondly that the overall

8

circumstances are such that no prejudice would be

9

entailed by allowing the amendment, and thirdly, that it

but for some adversary, he would have been the one

12

originally named.
Now, unquestionably Time Inc. fitted these

13
14

requirements pretty much as a hand might fit a glove.

15

The overriding requirement also in the rule is the

16

following, that this awareness must come home to the

17

party to be brought in, quote, "within the period

18

provided by law for commencing the action against him."
Now, almost from the inscription, this

19

20

provision in the Federal Civil Rules, two schools

21

emerged.

22

first in the Fifth Circuit,

23

to be given a reading infused with its purpose, i.e.

24

with its history and if so,

2

normally come to that very same party if originally and

correctly identified.

4

Now, in the latter case, a complaint can be

filed the last hour of a limitations period and then

6

promptly and within a reasonably short time, not

instantaneously, the summons and complaint go out and

QUESTION;

Ure you suggesting, Mr. Schnitzer,

2

that they had to read it before they knew whether they

3

would refuse it or accept it?

4

MR. SCHNITZER*

I am -- how shall I say,

5

morally certain that it was read, that a studied

6

decision was made after conferences with counsel who

7

deoiled that a mistake about the name was something that

8

could be capitalized on.

9

QUESTION*

If they didn't read it they mi'ght

10

find themselves having default judgments entered against

11

them in appropriate cases, is that not so?

12

MR. SCHNITZER;

Mot only would that happen,but

13

it seems to me that anybody who is accosted by a sheriff

14

who says, I have a summons and complaint for him, sajs

consequences that is, he's chargeable with notice of

The whole crux of the case is

exactly that.

For the two lower courts it was as

defendant been correctly named and received notice at

the instant in time when it got it through the summons

doubt that they would have heaved a sigh and proceeded

1

or any other court, I made a mistake so I’m excused.

2

That's what you want the rule to be?

3

MR. SCHNITZERi

That has not bean my

4

experience because I've made my quota of mistakes and

5

what I've found is that this magnificant body of

6

sparsely, sparely worded rules has within it the

7

capability to fulfill what I

8

commandment of all procedure described in Rule 1, and

9

that is to use the litigation period as an interval of

regard as the first

10

gestation for the safe deli/ery of the merits into a

11

final judgment at the other end of the process, unmarred

12

and unblemished by procedures so that mistakes are made

13

and this rule was written to correct mistakes.

14

If mistakes are made by a wise discipline,

the

15

system absorbs it because it’s in the nature of the

16

human condition to be frail and occasionally lapsing

17

into mistakes.

18

think has a, in my mind, a beautiful balancing tension

19

between regularity and

20

might be most seriously marred, and denying correction

within limits.

Of course. Your Honor.

HR. SCHNITZER;

9

Your Honor, in words, it dees

10

not.

There are three kinds of party changes;

about a more narrowly worded rule but also, in my view

2

the Commission was quite unmistakeable in its — how

shall I put it, in its expressed intention to make sure

4

that this very scenario, this very scenario, would never

happen again.

6

QUESTION;

Are you saying that the same rule

applies to a case in which you served Time Inc. when you

mean to serve Time Incorporated, as if you had served

Is it the

10

same rule, and then you would later change it to correct

11

it?

12

MR. SCHNITZER;

Yes, if you will be consistent

13

and say that if the rule is given an over-broad

14

interpretation, let it also be infused with the

15

Commission's purpose which by definition reads the magic

words,

Second Circuit simply held that a double standard notice

2

designed to contain pcejuiice and become a rule of thumb

3

for assessing prejudice, that a double standard of

4

notice not only is anomalous but inherently incompatible

5

with the fair administration of a rule of this Court for

6

which the intention need not be sought in other

7

publications but for which the Court has only to look

8

into it, as this Court carries the responsibility for

9

the consequences of how its rules work in- practice, i.e.

10

by the standard of whether the merits can be addressed

11

and fulfilled or whether they're blocked out by some

12

error which the Court has tne means to correct.
In my view there are five strong reasons why

13
14

the Court below should be reversed.

2

point of view which the Third Circuit adopted in this

3

case because asked for its comment cn it, the most that

4

they could say is the rule is toe plain not to read

5

literally, but no policy, no other reason or

6

justification for that result whereas those who favor

7

the point of view for which I argue, among courts, have

8

this to say, that they find it appealing, a member of

this Court said that,

that’s quite true about every application of the

Mr. Chief Justice, a nd may it

the guise of doing justice in their particular cases,

4

engage in a radical enterprise, namely amending a

federal rule in the guise of construing it, and

establishing a principle which I think is novel in the

Federal Rules, that the clear language of the Rules may

be disregarded and new language implied into the rule

they had initially named the party which lacked capacity

Does this record show whether the

9

MS.

Let me clarify that.

The service

It was sent under the relatively new procedure

13
14

under Rule 4 with a form of acknowledgement of service

15

so that it might be acknowledged by the person being

16

served, and that constitutes the consummation of service

17

in lieu of the old procedure of sending a marshal out.
So that, what happened when this was received,

2

promptly communicated to Mr. Geiser, Mr. Schnitzer's

3

colleague, so that there wa no doubt that Time had

4

access to and made a copy of the complaint after it was

5

received, within a few days after it was received and

The refusaL

MR. SANTA;

This is in the record.

4

MR,

BANTAc

Yes, it does.

The Advisory

amendment really involved i misnomer or misdescription

10

cn the one hand, or a change of party on the other with

Our position is that the effect of Rule 15-C

plaintiffs, in effect, there are two ways you can

22

file this complaint with the Court within the period of

the statute of limitations.

25

Or,

It is to say to

The first is

and tc

there is an alternate way of perfecting

the claim and this is the way that 15-C provides,
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

and

1

that is to file this complaint, possibly misnaming the

2

original — the proper party, so called, to be served,

3

spelling it, to file thi^ complaint but with in the

4

period of before the expiration of the statute of

5

limitations, to giva actual notice of the lawsuit, in

6

effect to the proper party to be served and then your

7

amendment to correct will relate back.
And, 15-C really provides additional alternate

8

9

ways for plaintiffs to perfect their belief, their

10

complaint.

11

and that's why we're here today, but it is not a double

12

standard in the language he says.

13

way for plaintiffs who have misnamed defendants, who

14

have named the wrong party and many of these cases

15

involve the naming of a

16

parent, a brother-sister corporation situation.

QUESTION*

Sc there is

the context of

Mr. Banta, it is still true, is it

8

not, that apart from the service problem if you had the

9

same kind of fact scenario that you have here, you named

10

the United States when you should have named the United

11

States Postal Service, didn’t correct it until after the

12

statute ran, you’i be out of luck?

13

KR. EANTA*

14

QUESTION!

15

Absolutely.

There is no question.

So that, the same rule applies to

the government as to private parties?

16

MR. BANTA;

The timeliness of the notice to

17

the government is absolutely crucial, and that is in our

18

19

15-C and the amendmen.s, and Professor Bise even

20

comments in his article on, that the government received

21

notice within the limitation period.

22

It goes right back to the baginring of Rule

So that, he was concerned about the

23

technicalities of naming the wrong party, but if you

24

serve the right party he was willing to feel that there

25

should be a rule overlooking

the technicalities of

the incumbent, or something along those lines.

So that, our position is that Pule 15-C is

workable.

reads.

elapsed after the statute had run out, and knew that it

was intended.
