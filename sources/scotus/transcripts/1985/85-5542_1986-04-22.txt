MR. BURR*

Mr. Chief Justice and nay it please

the Court i
The case of Alvin. Ford is before ycu tcday cn

a record which raises grava questions about Mr.

11

competence tc be executed, notwithstanding the

12

Governor's determination in Florida

14

Ford's

that Mr. Ford

is

The record shews a gradual, unrelenting

15

deterioration of Mr. Foci's mental health from late

16

December 1981 tc the present.

17

1982 Mr. Ford was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid

18

schizophrenia by a psychiatrist familiar with his

iredical histcry.

20

recommendation for therapy and medication was ignored by

21

prison staff.

The record shows that by

The record further shows that by late 1983,

Three of these psychiatrists agreed that Hr.

4

Ford suffered from psychosis or paranoid schizephrenia.

5

The record shews that# despite this substantial

6

agreement on medical diagnosis, the Governor’s

7

psychiatrists disagreed with the defense psychiatrist

8

concerning the legal consequences as to Hr.

9

competency of his medical condition.

Finally# the record shews that in determining

10

11

Mr. Ford’s competence to be executed#

12

Governor held no hearing of any kind to serf cut which

13

cf the conflicting psychiatric opinions was more

14

reliable.

of the defense psychiatrist who found that Mr. Ford was

incompetent to be executed.

These deficiencies in the Governor’s

19

competency determination process created, we submit, a

20

grave risk that the decision that Mr. Fcrd was competent

«as erreneous.

QUESTION^

What you’re going at is to tell us

23

that the Florida statute which prescribes the method for

24

dealing with this problem is invalid# is that it?

25

it the way in which they applied the statute?

(202) 628-9300

Or is

Which is

1

it?
MR. BURR;

2

Tha statutory procaiure, ws submit,

3

does not provide a sufficiently reliable process fcr the

4

le tar.minat ion of competent.
QUESTION;

Ycu think it must be an adversary

7

MR. EURR;

Yes, Your Honor, I dc.

8

QUESTION;

Nell, what if all the psychiatrists

had agreed?
MR. BURR;

10

If all

the psychiatrists had agreed

11

that Mr. Ford was competent, I think there would be nc

12

issue.

We world certainly agree —
QUESTION;

13

Well,

14

that this procedure,

MR. BURR;

16

I thought you were saying

this prevision, is invalid on its

Well, I think.

Your Boner, there

17

would have to be some threshold showing of incom petency,

18

similar tc a threshold shewing cf inccirpe te r c y before

19

trial, fcr example.

20

QUESTION;

Well, let’s assume there is a

21

thrasholi showing, but than all the psychiatrists

22

agree.

23

MR. BURR;

Well, if there is a threshold

24

showing of incompetency,

then whatever procedure follows

25

that results in all expert cpinicn being unanimous, then

the procedure would likely le at an end, lecause there'd

2

be nd issue to litigate.

3

QUESTION;

So it's just a question of the

4

application of this procedure in any particular case

5

that you're --

6

ME. BURR.*

Kell, I think --

7

QUESTION^

That triggers any kind of

8
9

constitutional problem?
MR. BURR;

In a case where competency is

10

seriously in question, this procedure we submit is

11

inaiequate.

12

QUESTION;

Mr. Burr, this Court has never held

13

that it's required that a iefendant be found competent

14

before he can be executed, has it?

15

ME. B URRi

Bo, Your Eonor.

16

QUESTION;

You contend that it isn't just the

17

Florida statute, though; that there's a requirement of

18

the United States Constitution that says that cne must

19

be competent to be executal?

20

MR. BURRi

That's right, we submit that there

21

are two legs upon which this issue stands.

One is

22

certainly the state-created interest in being spared

23

from execution whan incompetent.

24

25

and unusual tc execute those who are incompetent at the

QUESTION!

3

Is it cruel aid unusual to imprison

someone who is incompetent?
MR, BURR:,

4

I think the question would have to

5

be resolved on the basis cf

6

punishment.
QUESTION:

7

the nature cf the

So it could be in some

8

circumstances crueL and unusual to imprison someone who

9

is incompetent?
NR. BURE*

10

It could be, depending cn the

11

nature of the incompetency and the nature of the

sentence•

13

QUESTION:

And he would then have a right to

14

be released from prison, I take it, if he cculd shew he

15

were incompetent?

16

MR. BURR:

Veli,

I think that the alternative

17

would not be release from prison.

18

still be there to be served, but the person would

19

probably be treated in some mental health facility.

20

could be a forensic mental health facility.

25

modern day analysis.

11

Sell, that’s certainly true.

Eut

as this Court’s jurisprudence has developed in the last
two cr three decades, the question cf procedure and
right are two separate questions.
QUESTION;

12
13

Granted, there are statements in

Well, not inexorably.

Certainly

Solesbee against Balkccm didn’t treat it that way.
MR. BURR;

14

Solesbee in my view treated the

15

issue from the perspective of procedure.

16

asked, what is the way that this interest has been

17

protected.

18

interest to clemency, whicn was a wholly discretionary

19

process in which varicus reasons for mercy cculd be

20

submitted by a coniamned

21

22

wholly on that party's discretion.

QUESTION!

Da you tnink it violates any

3

constitutional provision for a state legislature tc vest

4

in the Governor authority to act on the sentence and to

5

set it aside?

6

MS. B URRi

No, not per se.

Certainly

7

Gcverncrs are deemed appropriate and highly appropriate

8

decision makers as to clemency questions.

9

As to this question, which we submit is a

10

rights question and net a discretionary mercy sort cf

11

question, the Governor may be an appropriate decision

12

maker, depending in part cn the source of the right.

13

would probably not be an appropriate decision maker

14

ultimately for an Eighth Amendment right.

15

state-created right, the Governor, assuming he acts vith

16

impartiality and detachment, could be an appropriate

17

decision maker.

18

Fe

But for the

There could be practical problems from a

19

prejudgment perspective, because tne Governor may in a

Justice O’Connor, 3 think that a

Again, through a long line of

And in each of those decisions, where the

9
10

state takes involuntary action against a person who may

11

be mentally ill, if mental illness is either a factual

12

predicate for the state’s action or a defense against

13

the state’s action, the Court has said

14

be the adversarial crucible in which to make a reliable

15

decision.

16

Now, that,

that there has to

as I anderstaii the Court’s

17

decisions, recuires a couple of critical components that

18

can’t be taken care of on pa pe r;

So I think it would have to be an oral

QUESTION:.

Mr. Barr, can I ask you what in

your view the test of incompetence is for this purpose?
MR. BURR;

2
3

Again, I think the test wculd

depend upon the source of the right.

4

QUESTION;

Assume it's the Eighth Amendment.

5

MR. BURR:.

If the test is the Eighth

6

Amendment, we have proposed a test that we believe

7

follows the contours of the Eighth Amendment reasons for

8

the right in the first place.

9

Easically, there world he

The first wculd be similar to the flcrida

15

is different from the first test.

would be based

17

concern, and

that is whether the person has sufficient

18

capacity to know any facts which might cause his

19

conviction or sentence to be reversed and the ability to

20

communicate it to counsel.

21

whether the person understands the nature and

Secondly, whether the person has the capacity

So we would submit that the Eighth Amendment

22

interest would span -- Eighth Amendment test would span

23

all three of these interests.

24
25

I'd like to

talk briefly about four concerns

which I think the need for a reliable procedure raises.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The first I have already addressed briefly, and that is

2

the need for a threshold shewing cf incomretency before

3

any plenary procelare, however it be defined, sin be

4

invoked.

5

We certainly concede that some threshold

showing should be required.
