Yes, Your Honor.

And if the State were to -seize

videotape in such a business for a particular film, is

there an obligation on the part of the State to provide

7

There’s an obligation not only

8

to provide a hearing, adversarial under Heller, but

there's an obligation to allow him to copy it.

If the

10

copying process is not good enough, we must return to

that there need not be a pre-seizure adversarial

First, the affidavits are introduced by the

as adult films, indicative of their strong sexual

Well, the affidavits purport to

they do, but there are

11

could be expected based on the oreiouia a nee of the

13

Mr. DeFranks, assume for a moment

that the warrant was not supported by probable cause

MR. DeFRANKS*

18

QUESTIONi

Yes, it is.

Do you think then that,

under the

19

.eon case, that the material could be seized in any

20

event?

21

MR. DeFRANKS*

I would think that under leon

22

this warrant and seizure would be upheld.

My problem is

23

that the wew York Court of Appeals has rejected the good

24

faith exception to the warrant requirement.

25

the case were determined on a good faith basis and

Thus,

QUESTION!

As a matter of state law?

3

MS. DeFRANKS;

Yes.

Qiven that the Magistrate

4

credited the assertions of the affiant in this case, and

5

there being no reason for anyone to suggest that

6

something was left oat of these affidavits, I think it's

7

fair and it's reasonable to conclude that the films

8

demonstrated probable obscenity.
Lastly, in conclusion, I assert and we request

9
10

that affidavits be accepted as a legitimate basis upon

11

which to found a probable cause determination in an

12

obscenity case.

QUESTION*

May I ask you a question.

NR. DeFRANKSv

4

QUESTION*

Yes, sir.

You are not asking us to review the

5

affidavits themselves to decide whether there is

6

probable cause, are you?

7

presented, the question is whether a matter of federal

8

constitutional law something more than probable cause is

9

required, and that is all you are asking us to decide?

Supposing we read the Court of

Appeals’ opinion, and I was looking at page A-7 right

15

16

about, probable cause can or cannot be inferred.

17

would you ask us to do then?

As to each of these moves.

And what is it in the opinion —

could you tell me where

you think the majority makes it

10

most clear that they are applying an elevated standard,

11

without regard to what the dissent says about it,

12

because sometimes I think it’s a mistake to rely on

13

other opinions tc interpret the majority.

14

MR. DeFRAN'fS:

WelL, first I would refer the

15

Court to page A-7 where they refer to their standard.

16

This would be footnote 3 at A-7.

17

referring to the standard as being rejected unanimously.

18

QUESTION:

That’s the majority

That’s referring tc what the

19

dissent said.

20

is there anything in the text of the opinion that

21

supports your view that they ha/e applied anything other

22

than a probable cause standard?

23

It said, dissent doesn’t cite any -- but

ME. DeFRANKS:

All right.

I would submit that

24

page — the top paragraph of page A-7, the Court there

25

indicates that the affidavits are ambiguous, equivocal.

ME. DeFRANKS;

QUESTION;

17

ME. DeFEANKS;

Yes.

But you say they misapplied that?
Yes.

As the dissenter points

18

out, they were asking for an unequivocal demonstration

19

of obscenity to establish probable cause to believe that

20

the material was obscene.

21

QUESTION;

Well, you say that, but their

22

opinion doesn't say they're asking for an unequivocal

23

demonstration of obscenity, does it?

only a

The Court says on page A-5, consistent with

10

11

these rules, the fast of the issuing Magistrate in this

12

case was not to decide guilt or innocence but to

13

determine in a preliminary way from the information

14

submitted and available to him, whether there was

15

probable cause to believe that the material to be seized

16

was obscene within the tripartite definition of the

statute.

18

I recognize that, but what about

19

the sentence at the bottom of A-4, because there was

Art and all the cases we've talked about today, there's

a higher standard in a sense that the judge nust forus

Court used the word, on the question of obscenity, in

5

Marcus, as opposed to probable obscenity.
So, what we're saying,

I think is wat we've

said in all these First Amendment -- aid these search
