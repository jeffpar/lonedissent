you are ready .
ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. FINCUS,

ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. PINCUSi

Thank ycu, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, the federal government

10

disburses billions of dollars to state and local

11

governments pursuant to a variety of grant programs.

12

recipient of such a federal grant must agree to abide by

13

statutory and regulatory requirements designed to ensure

14

that the grant will further the goals of the federal

15

program, and the relevant statute typically provides

16

that a grant recipient must repay to the federal

17

goverment any funds spent in violation of those

18

statutory and regulatory requirements.

19

This authority to recoup unlawfully spent

20

federal funds generally serves as the federal

21

government’s principal method of enforcing compliance

22

with these grant requirements,

23

grant funds are used by recipients in a manner that

24

furthers the public interest.

25

A

and thereby ensuring that

This case concerns the government’s ability to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

utilize this enforcement authority with respect to

2

grants under the Comprehensive Employment and Training

3

Act, generally known as CETA.

4

The specific question presented here is

5

whether a procedural statute establishing a time limit

6

for agency action should be interpreted tc cut off the

7

federal governments’

8

disbursed grant funds and thereby immunize grant

9

recipients from this obligation to repay such funds tc

10

authority to recover unlawfully

the United States,

11

The CETA funds that are specifically the

12

subject of this action were expended by respondent

13

during the years 1974 to 1977,

15

for economically disadvantage! persons.

16

CETA was a federal

The Secretary of labcr disbursed funds tc

17

states and localities who operated employment programs,

18

and the states and localities'in turn agreed that their

19

programs would comport with

20

in the federal statute and the regulations promulgated

21

by the Secretary.

22

the requirements set fcrth

Department of Labor officials conducted two

23

separate audits of respondent's expenditures of CETA

24

grant funds.

25

and pursuant to the applicable regulations, the audit

The audits uncovered some irregularities,

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

reports were transmitted for further review to the grant

2

officer who administered respondent's grants.

3

It is the receipt of these audit reports by

4

the grant officer that provides the basis for

5

respondent's invocation of the statutory provision that

6

is in issue in this case.

7

106(b) of the CETA statute, states that the Secretary cf

This provision.

Section

8

Labor shall issue a final determination within 120 days

9

of the receipt of a complaint alleging the unlawful use

10

of CETA funds by a grant recipient.

11

Here, the grant officer did not issue a final

12

determination with respect to the information uncovered

13

in the audits until more than 28 months after his

14

receipt of the reports.

15

certain of respondent's expenditures violated CETA

16

requirements principally because respondent had used the

17

federal funds to hire persons who were ineligible under

18

the federal standards of the CETA program.

19

The grant officer found that

The grant officer therefore ordered respondent

20

to repay to the United States an amount equal to the

21

misspent grant funis.

22

officer's determination to an administrative law judge

23

pursuant to the scheme set forth in the statute and

24

regulations.

25

officer's substantive determination about the propriety

Respondent appealed the grant

And in addition to challenging the grant

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

of its expenditure of funis, respondent claims that the

2

grant officer’s repayment order was invalid because it

3

was not issued within the 120-day time period set forth

4

in Section 106(b).
Now, the Administrative Law Judge specifically

5

6

addressed this claim, and found that respondent had

7

suffered no prejudice because of the delay in issuing

8

the repayment order.

9

claim that Section 106(b) rendered the repayment order

It therefore rejected respondent’s

10

invalid, and the Administrative Law Judge himself issued

11

an order directing respondent to repay a total of

12

$373,000, the amount of grant funds that he determined

13

to have been expended in violation of the substantive

14

rules of the CETA program.
QUESTIONS

15

Mr. Pincus, may I ask what the

16

government’s position would be if the ALJ had found

17

prejudice?

18

MR. PINCUSi

Well, Your Honor, in our reply

19

brief we discuss that problem to some extent.

20

state as a preliminary matter that it seems quite

21

unlikely that any prejudice could be found simply

22

because of the way the process operates.

23

Let me

The grant recipient gets notice -- at the same

24

time that the grant officer gets the audit report, the

25

grant recipient gets notice that there are some

(202) 628-9300

1

irregularities that are being questioned, and therefore

2

at that initial date he is on notice that he should be

3

preserving documents and preparing his case.

4

QUESTION*

Say there was an earthquake cr

5

something, and they lost the document.

6

my question?

7

MR. PINC'JSi

Sure.

Would you answer

No, I am sorry, I was

8

going to come to that.

9

prejudice, and if there is no excuse for the Secretary's

If there is a showing of

10

delay, we think that in an appropriate case, that some

11

either the withdrawal of the repayment order cr some

12

other equitable adjustment of the remedy might^be

13

appropriate.

14

Of course,

we think that the appropriate test

15

probably is a test similar to the Barker against Wingo

16

four-factor test that looks to the length of the delay,

17

the reasons for the delay, whether or not the grant

18

recipient in this case has invoked any right that he

19

might have to a speedy determination, and if the

20

balancing of those factors indicates that there is

21

prejudice, then we think some adjustment would be

22

appropriate.

23

QUESTION*

24

MR. PINCUSi

25

Thank you.
The Ninth Circuit reversed the

Administrative Law Judge's determination, and held that
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Section 106(b) prohibited the Secretary from recovering

2

misspent CETA grant funds whenever a final determination

3

is not issued within 120 days.

4

rested its conclusion upon what it viewed as the plain

5

meaning of the statute.

6

states that the secretary shall issue a final

7

determination within 120 days, and concluded that the

8

simple use of the term "sha11"’barred any subsequent

9

issuance of a repayment order.

10

The Court of Appeals

It observed that Section

1C6(b)

The Court of Appeals rejected the Secretary’s

11

argument that the legislative history of Section

12

showed that Congress did not intend to impose any

13

limitation upon the Secretary’s enforcement authority.

14

106(b)

Now, we submit that each of the Court of

15

Appeals* conclusions was demonstrably incorrect.

Beth

16

the language used by Congress in drafting Section

106(b)

17

and the relevant legislative history make clear beyond

18

any doubt that this prevision should net be interpreted

19

to limit the Secretary's authority to recover unlawfully

20

spent federal funds.

21

Indeed, three Courts of Appeals, including the

22

Eighth Circuit and the decision that was issued last

23

week have agreed with cur position regarding the proper

24

interpretation of Section 106(b).

25

The Ninth Circuit's basic error was its
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

failure to correctly identify the question of statutory

2

interpretation that is presented here.

3

Appeals found that the 120-day.time limit vas mandatory,

4

and then assumed without making any further inquiry that

5

the effect of the time limit was to restrict the

6

Secretary’s enforcement authority.

7

Tha Court of

But even when a time limit relating to

8

government action is mandatory, rather than simply

9

directory, there remains a second inquiry.

It is

10

necessary to determine the proper remedy for the

11

government’s failure to comply with that time

12

limita tion.

13

/

In cur view, Section

106(b) should be read tc

14

confer upon interested parties a right to an expeditious

15

determination regarding the propriety of the grant

16

officer's expenditures, a right which could be enforced

17

by obtaining an order from an Administrative Law Judge,

18

for example, directing the grant officer to issue his

19

final determination expeditiously where the grant

20

officer has failed to act within 120 days.

21

He think it is plain that Congress did net

22

intend the remedy to be tha cutting off of the

23

government's right to recover unlawfully spent funds

24

simply because tha Secretary did not act within the

25

relevant time period.
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

New, Section 106(b),

1

of course, is silent

2

regarding

the appropriate remedy in the event the

3

Secretary fails to act in a timely manner.

4

Court’s decisions and a long line of decisions in the

5

Courts of Appeals salce clear that this silence itself is

6

dispositive of the question of the appropriate remedy.

But this

7

The Court frequently has observed

that

8

statutes should be interpreted to protect the public

9

interest against the consequences of delay by public

10

officials,

and it has refused to construe statutory time

11

limits to bar actions commenced by the United States,

12

for example, unless there is a clear indication that

13

Congress intended that result.
And the practical common sense of such a rule

14
15

is quite obvious.

Congress often attempts to spur

16

agencies to quicker action by including in a statute

17

requirement that regulations be issued in a certain

18

number of days, or that another type of administrative

19

determination be made within a specified period.
QUESTION*

20

It was certainly unsuccessful here,

21

wasn't it, in spurring the Labor Department to any quick

22

action.

23
24

MR. PINCUS*

Well, unfortunately, lour Honor,

by 1978, when Section 105(b) was enacted,

the Labor

»

25

Department was already so far behind that it was -- they
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

had a long backlog to catch up with before they could

2

even begin to process new actions in a timely manner.

3

Unfortunately, the burdens of a lot of

4

complaints and a lot of audit results and the lack,

5

perhaps, of sufficient staff just made it impossible fcr

6

the Secretary to comply with this time limitation in

7

many cases.
QUESTION*

8
9

Nr. Pincus, can I ask,

I know there

are a lot of cases that say that unless the statute of

10

limitations expressly applies to the government, we

11

don’t read that in.
Here, of course, it clearly does apply to the

12
13

government, and your argument, rather, is that they

14

didn’t specify a remedy for failure to meet the time,

15

and there is a general rule that then there is no

16

remedy, I guess, or no significant remedy.
What is the case that most directly supports

17
18

that argument that you rely on, the strongest authority

19

you have for that proposition?

20
21

NR. PINCUS*

A case in this Court, Your

Honor?

22

QUESTION;

23

HR. PINCUS;

Yes.
Wall, I think there is no case in

24

this Court that — decided by this Court that directly

25

supports that proposition.

I guess the cases that are
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

closest to this Court's decision in Wurts and the

2

Wheland case and the St. Paul Railroad case, because in

3

those casas it was clear that Congress had enacted a

4

statute cf limitations, and the question was what the

5

scope of the limitations, what actions would be

6

encompassed within the statute of limitations —

7

QUESTION*

Nc, I put that group tc one side,

8

because here it is clear that the statute dees apply to

9

the government, and my question is, and the basic

10

argument you make, as I understand it, is, yes, but they

11

didn't tell us what the consequence of the failure to

12

comply with

13

tell us the consequence you can ignore the statute, and

14

I was just wondering if there was any — really any

15

authority for that argument.

the deadline was, and you say if they don't

When you press it —
There is a different remedy

available for the government's failure to comply.

What is the remedy for the failure

to comply here?
MR. PINCUSi

The remedy would be an injunction

from an Administrative Law Judge directing the

25

government to act expeditiously.

QUESTION^

Please sue us.

Please start the

proceedings to recover money from us.
HR. PINCUSi

Hell, Your Honor, the remedy may

4

seem a little odd in this circumstance, because, as I

5

will discuss later in my argument, the purpose of

6

Section 106(b) was not to protect grant recipients at

7

all, it was just to protest the people who filed

8

complaints, and those people clearly would have

9

incentives to get an order to direct expeditous action.

10

QUESTION!

You don’t think the grant

11

recipients have any interest in knowing where they stand

12

on these claims.

13

HE. FINCUS*

Hell, Your Honor, if they have

14

such an interest, then they should invoke it.

17

trial right is a criminal defendant asking to be tried,

18

but if the defendant wants to know where he stands, then

19

he has to invoke the right, and this Court has said

20

whether or not the defendant invokes his right is an

21

important question in determining whether or not your

22

rights have been violated,

same kind of analysis applies here.

We think the factors are

In this Court's decision in 8850, it applied

the Barker against Wingo tests to see how long delay
permits, although there, too, there was not a specific
deadline, but we think it is still appropriate in
deciding what remedy is appropriate.
QUESTIONS

What about the Courts of Appeals?

I taka it you have support in the Courts of Appeals for
your position.
MR. PINCUSs

Yes,

Your Honor, both with

respect to this particular statute, three Courts of
Appeals have ruled in our favor in respect to our
general principle that statutory time limits on agency
action do not cut off

the government's authority in the

absence of express consequences.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS, ESQ. ,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

7

MR. PINCUSi

8

As I discussed in my remarks before the lunch

9

Thank you, Hr. Chief Justice.

break and in my colloquy with Justice Stevens, we submit

10

that the general principle underlying a number of this

11

Court's decisions that the public interest should not be

12

sacrificed due to the negligence of government officers

13

itself supports our reading of Section 106(b).

14

However, the legislative history of the

15

provision independently mandates the conclusion that

16

Congress did not intend to limit the Secretary's

17

enforcement authority by enacting a provision, and this

18

conclusion is supported both by the specific legislative

19

history of the provision and the general purposes of the

20

1970 CETA amendments that included Section 106(b).

21

With respect to Section 106(b) itself,

the

22

legislative history establishes that the provision was

23

enacted to protect individuals who had filed complaints

24

against grant recipients such as respondent.

25

CETA statute had authorized individuals employed in CETA

The 1973

1

programs as well as other interested parties to file

2

complaints with the Secretary of Labor alleging that a

3

grant recipient had failed tc comply with the applicable

4

statutory or regulatory requirements.
For example, an employee might allege that a

5

6

grant recipient was paying improperly low wages.

7

Congress found in 1978 that the Labor Department was not

8

processing these complaints within a reasonable time,

9

and that it therefore enacted the 120-day time limit in

10

Section 106(b) to remedy this particular problem.

11

Section 106(b) thus was designed to enable

12

CETA program beneficiaries to enable more expeditious —

13

to enable — tc obtain, rather, a more expeditious

14

resolution of their claims against grant recipients.
QUESTION*

15

Mr. Pincus, does the legislative

17

what Congress thought should be done at the end of

18

days?

19

MB. PINC73*

enacted tc protect the rights cf complaints, not to

isn't any contradictory legislative history as to what

should be, and because that comment fits so closely with

Again, it just — it wouldn't make any sense

22

that the remedy for the Secretary's failure to comply

SR. QUIN^s

Sell,

Your Honor, there was in

fact a maintenance of effort claim earlier in the case,
and it dropped by the wayside at the Administrative Law
Judge level.

That means — maintenance of effort is the

concept that federal grant money shall be used to
supplement rather than supplant your local funds, and
the Administrative Law Judge, based upon the evidence,
made a finding that these people would in fact have been
laid off by Pierce County because of the budget problems
that we had at the time,

January of 1975.

He was

satisifed under all the evidence that there was no
maintenance of effort and there was no paper layoff,
31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

that they were legitimate rehires, but what he said was,
you ics still liable, because there is~a technical
violation, and that is all I wanted to point out tc the
Court, was the nature of the alleged violations.
The second thing I wanted to point out about
these grants factually is that one of the grants was
what we call a coniuit grant, where the money was merely
passed through Pierce County in part, not in its
entirety, but some of the participants were not even
employees of Pierce County

as public service employees.

They were either private sector or other public sector
employees, and all Pierce County dii was do the intake
processing, as we call it, the personnel work, and then
referred them to the school district or the private
industry that accepted them for unemployment.
So, and I think that becomes relevant later
on, when you think about the equities of the case, that
they were not even — in other words, the money of their
wages did not even go to Pierce County in seme cases.

MR. QUINN*

Yes, Ycur Honor.

I think the

3

context in which it would arise and does arise in the

Administrative Law Judge practice under CETA is that the

5

grantee has to raise it as an affirmative defense, a

statute of limitations-like defense.

it is incumbent upon the Department of Labor to come

forward with evidence to get around the limitations

there is nothing in the legislative history that

We think

Indeed, respondent’s counsel just admitted
