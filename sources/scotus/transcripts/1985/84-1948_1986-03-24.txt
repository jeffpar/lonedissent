The decision of the Court

Such a result is wholly inconsistent with the

16

purpose of the emergency loan program which was to enable

17

farmers to make qood their losses on crops that were namaqed

18

at that time and then to resume their operations with regular

19

credit from other sources .

20

The loan program provided substantial government

21

benefits , including an outriqht grant of $5 , 000 to each farmer

22

at an interest rate of one percent .

23

These funds , however, could not be used to produce

24

new crops in 1974 or subsequent years, but only to reimburse

25

farmers for their 1973 losses so that they could remain in

I

At this late date, the relief ordered by the Court

3

of Appeals would amount to a government give-away to persons

who could not reasonably have unmet needs from so long ago .
