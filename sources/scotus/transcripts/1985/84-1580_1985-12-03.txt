FREY;

Thank you,

Mr.

Chief Justice,

and

may it please the Court, the question before the Court,

10

today is whether the Federal Rules of Evidence are

11

unconstitutional insofar as they

declarations without requiring the prosecution to

produce the declarant or to demonstrate his

inavailability.

conversations as evidence against respondent.

2

those conversations he was a party to, and were between

3

him and a co-conspirator, John Lazaro.

4

conversation was between two individuals who testified

5

as prosecution witnesses at trial, and the fifth

6

conversation was between Lazaro and a co-conspirator

7

named Levin, who invoked the Fifth Amendment privilege

8

and was found unavailable at trial.

^hree of

A fourth

Respondent demanded that the prosecution show

10

the unavailability of any co-conspirator declarants, and

11

to accommodate the District Court's practical wishes,

12

the prosecution did subpoena Lazaro to appear for trial,

13

but he failed to appear, allegedly due to car troubles.

14

Ultimately,

the District Court ruled that

15

Lazaro’s statements on these intercepted conversations

16

were admissible under the traditional co-conspirator

17

exception now embodied in Rule 801 of the Federal Rules

18

of Evidence.

19

found that Rule 801 was satisfied, but it fcjnd that the

confrontation clause was violated because the

prosecution had not satisfactorily demonstrated that the

the land have seen the basic right of confrontation

We think that, is not possible.

Far. more

likely, in our opinion, is the view that the dictum in

11

Ohio against Roberts referred to the class of cases,

12

that is, prior testimony and the like, in which the

cited in Roberts parallel a similar development of the

hearsay rules.

what you are referring to.

2

as I recollect from the respondent’s brief, the

development o±.

4

of unavailability is all post-1980, post the dictum in

5

Ohio against Roberts,

Would it depend in part on how

MR. FREYs

That would be only a small part of

the problem.

17

that would be something that would have to be fleshed

That would be a part of the problem, and

19

cases in this Court, as it has taken decades to flesh

22

Mow,

it is not essential, I think, to the

23

Court’s decision here, but I want to spend just a minute

24

on the question of whether the confrontation clause

25

reaches so far as to regulate co-conspirator

You say in effect that if the

.declaration of an adverse party can be admitted against

10

in open court, the declaration of an agent of an adverse

11

party can be admitted on the same principal?
MR. FREY*

12

That is a part of the rationale for

13

the co-conspiratoi declaration, and we would certainly

14

say that, but I think what we are saying is broader in

15

this immediate connection, which is that it was never

16

intended for the confrontation clause to concern itself

17

with most kinds of hearsay.

cited at Page 22 of our brief, state cases, suggest that

the witnesses that the Sixth Amendment s^ys and the

state constitutional provision said the defendant had to

view of Wigmore and Justice Harlan's view in concurrence

And the.Court indicated in

10

Roberts that that view had not been accepted by this

11

Court, and at the other extreme is the view which I

12

understand respondent to take and which may be supported

by dictum in Dutton and Roberts, that all hearsay is

regulated by the confrontation clause.

the better view is that out of court declarations of a

13

kind that are retrospective but done in contemplation of

19

trial, that are of a testimonial nature -- when the

20

Sixth Amendment refers to a witness, what it is

21

referring to is somebody who is aiving testimony or the

22

functional equivalent of testimony.

that the rule treats co -con.se irator statements as exempt

MR. FBEYi

Well, we have a long footnote in

our reply brief that addresses that question.

15

say that the exemption is based on three different

16

considerations.

17

is based on the fact that co-conspirator declarations by

1

dictum in Roberts was meant to be descriptive rather

2

than prescriptive, but it would be a wholly inaccurate

3

description of the state of the law with respect to most

4

hearsay exceptions, including

declaration, but totally accurate as an explanation of

6

the treatment of depositions and prior testimony.

7

Now,

secondly, if you read the dictum

8

literally, it gees too far, because it not only imposes

the requirement of showing unavailability and

reliability on co-conspirator declarations, but it

invalidates all of Rule £03.

to try to get around that, but the fact of the matter is

13

that if you read it literally, it makes Rule 803

14

unconstitutional as well as Rule 801.

read it as limited to the proposition established by the

was raised by the District Court, respondent’s counsel

Now, respondent has said a lot about the

16

importance of the right of cross examination, and

17

don't, mean to speak against the value of cross

18

examination at all.

19

respondent has not explained why that right of cross

20

examination is not protected by Pule 806 of the Rules of

21

Evidence which allowed respondent to call Lazarc as a

22

witness and cross examine him.

23

I

It clearly is very important.

But

It specifically says in the case of hearsay

24

declarants, you can do that.

So I don't think the

25

problem was an inability to cross examine Lazaro.
1 8

(202) 628-9300

The

1

problem was a desire to jerk the prosecution around,

2

which is essentially what has happened here.

3

Now,

the fact is that if the cc-ccnspirator

4

declarant is not already being called by one party or

5

the other as a witness, it is probably because he is in

6

fact unavailable, or is judged not to be a desirable

7

source of evidence, and what the Third Circuit's rule

8

requires is that prosecutors produce or show the

9

unavailability cf every co-conspirator declarant even

10

though if produced virtually none of these would be

11

called to testify.

12

Now, does that rule make any sense at all?

13

Now,

14
15

let me turn to the co^t side, because

Justice O'Connor did ask that question.

You put in evidence which was

by the other side.
MR. FREY;

6

I don't agree that the other side

7

could not — if -- I am not sure what the purpose of

8

cross — they could cross examine the witness through

9

whom we put on the evidence,

that is, to determine

10

whether the declaration was made and what the

11

circumstances of it were.

12

In this case it was a recording, but they

13

could determine how the recording was made, that it

14

wasn't tampered wit, and all these other things.

15

that point the evidence speaks for itself.

16

true that Lazaro might have something to say that would

17

contradict the tendency of the evidence or that would

18

explain the evidence in a way that is favorable to the

19

defendant.

16

Dutton and — Dutton particularly because of how you

17

deal with an accomplice's confession.

18

that an accomplice's confession is testimonial, and

19

makes him a witness if it is used.

20

Now, I would say

Now, it may be able to be used under the

21

confrontation clause anyway, or it may not, depending on

22

confrontation clause rules, but I think that my approach

23

of asking whether the out of court declaration is

24

testimonial in character and therefore makes him a

25

witness within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment is

different from Justice Harlan's approach, and I think it

Let me get back to Dutton against Evans.

First of all, the

It has been said by the advisory committee

that that was really a case that was largely concerned

with prosecutorial misconduct.

which is a co-conspirator declaration not within the

traditional rule, I would like to read what the Court

said about the traditional co-conspirator declaration.

This is at Page 80 of 400 US.

When we come to Dutton,

"The argument seems to b» rather that in any

19

given case the Constitution requires a reappraisal of

20

every exception to the hearsay rule no matter how long

21

established in order to determine whether, in the words

22

of the Court of Appeals, it is supported by salient and

cogent reasons.

the present case it is argued only that the hearsay

exception applied by Georgia is constitutionally invalid

because it doesn’t conform to the federal hearsay

exception.

"Appellee does not challenge and we do not

Sow, as far as what the government said or

13

didn't say at trial, I believe at the time of trial

14

there was a Third Circuit decision called Gibbs, a

15

decision later overruled en banc that did require us to

16

produce or show the unavailability of a witness.

17

as what respondent's position was at trial, if you look

18

at Page 1^ of the appendix, you will see that they

19

thought unavailability was a condition of admission and

20

production would not do to get the statement in.
