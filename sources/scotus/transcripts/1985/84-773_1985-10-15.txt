CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

We will hear arguments now

in Bender against Williamsport School.

Mr. Smart, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES MADISON SMART, JR., ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

7

8

MR. SMART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

9

The facts of this case are not extremely complicated,

10

but they can be misunderstood.

11

teacher-led or government-prescribed religious activities.

12

Very simply, students from Williamsport Area High School, which

13

we represent, wanted to meet during the extracurricular activity

14

period.

15

Then permission was withdrawn after the first meeting, but

16

solely because the school's lawyer felt that allowing student

17

meetings containing prayer ard religious expression would

18

violate the Establishment Clause.

19

This case does not involved

The school was origii ally content to let them meet.

Now, since the lawyer's belief was the only reason

20

for the denial of meeting space in this case, the legal issue

21

is very narrow and that is simply whether the Establishment

22

Clause requires a high school to censor out the religious

23

expression of private individuals after having first created

24

an opportunity for students to engage in their own self-

25

initiated activities and expression.

jurisdictional question at all in this case?
MR. SMART:

4

No, Your Honor.

By that, do you mean

by that —

MR. SMART:

7

QUESTION:

8

Mr. Smart, do you think there is a

Well, Mr. Youngman and his —
All right.
— and his position in the case.

Did

the Court of Appeals have jurisdiction, do you think?

9

MR. SMART:

In our opinion, they did, Your Honor,

10

and the case is properly here.

11

versy.

It is a valid case or contro­

However —

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SMART:

And, why do you think -f-hey have jurisdiction?
Well, it was our judgment that Mr.

14

Youngman probably stood in the same position as Mrs. Bashdi

15

McCollum in the McCollum case in 1948 as a parent.

16

But, if the Court should decide that Mr. Youngman

17

does not have standing, the correct disposition of this case

18

would be to vacate the Third Circuit decision and

19

reinstate the decision of the district court.

20

Now, it is important to understand that in this —

QUESTION:

25

While you are on that subject, Mr. Youngman

is no longer a member of the School Board, is he?
MR. SMART:

Mr. Youngman is no longer a member of

the School Board, as I understand it.
QUESTION:

And, he no longer has any children in

QUESTION:

5

MR. SMART:

6

He has a child in the Williamsport Area

How old?
I believe his child is in the ninth grade,

if I am not mistaken.

8

QUESTION:

Now, how does that bear on the issues.

You sued him in his official capacity, as I understand it.

9

MR. SMART:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

Was there.any framing of liability againt

11

him individually in any sense?

12

MR. SMART:

13

QUESTION:

14

in the school.

15

Not that I am aware of, Your Honor.
How is it relevant that he has got a child

Could any parent have appealed this judgment?

MR. SMART:

Well, Your Honor, in reviewing the McCollum

16

case, it appeared that that was the case, but we would be quite

17

content —

18

QUESTION:

In the McCollum case, wasn't there an

19

allegation that the child was being offended in some way by

20

these practices?

21

in any way, are they?

his children?

pleased to have the district court decision in this case

reinstated since it was in favor of our clients.
QUESTION:

3
4

MR. SMART:

QUESTION:

8

MR. SMART:

10

Yes, Your Honor.

He was a member of

the School Board in the district court.

7

9

There still

wouldn't be a case of controversy even in the district court.

5

6

Why would that be the result?

He is no longer.
He is no longer a member of the School

Board.
QUESTION:

Well, I know, but suppose the Court of

11

Appeals said a piece of controversy has just washed out, wouldn't

12

it have directed the district court to dismiss the case?

13

MR. SMART:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe so.

14

I believe it would have been a valid decision at the district

15

court level since all parties were properly represented.

16

QUESTION:

Well, it might have been a valid decision

17

at the time the district court rendered it, but I think our

18

practice, since the time of the Munsingwear case, you know,

19

some years ago, has been to say if it becomes moot on appeal,

20

the whole thing washes out.

21

In other words, you would simply go back and there

22

would be no district court decision, you would have no Court

23

of Appeals decision.

24
25

MR.

Well, if that were the case, then the

Court of Appeals would have two options if that were the law,
6
a

nracnv- aranaT1 v r rAi(:i3» ^ w

1

Your Honor.

One would be to treat it as a case or controversy

2

that is capable of repetition, yet evading review, or to wash

3

the whole thing out.
QUESTION:

4

Why not, Mr. Smart?

Was not the vote

5

against Mr. Youngman's position in the Board itself eight to

6

one?
MR. SMART:

7

8

I believe that —
QUESTION:

9
10

So, he had no support for his position

at all.

11

MR. SMART:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

I believe that is correct, Your Honor.

No, Your Honor, he did not.
Of course, the School Board doesn't decide

the constitutional questions with finality, do they?.,
MR. SMART:

No, Your Honor, however, they do decide

15

what course the School District takes and the Respondent is

16

here in the capacity as an original member of this lawsuit

17

against whom we sought individual liability, including attorney's

18

fees, and he has represented that he is in this lawsuit at

19

this point as a parent.

20

QUESTION:

So, he could have been a plaintiff in

21

the case originally?

22

MR. SMART:

23

Yes, Your Honor.

That is our view of

the McCollum case.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SMART:

So, you think he is still in the case?
We believe he is still in the case and
7

ai

nFRSON RFPOBTiNir: row aa \ v i\r

1

we believe it is still a valid case or controversy.
It is important to understand that in this case the

2
3

record shows that the school did not simply make available

4

certain specified activities to the students during this activity

5

period.

6

this, or this, take your pick of those.

7

said to the students, students, you decide what you will do

8

during the activity period.

The school did not say, students, you can do this,
Instead, the school

QUESTION:

Is that the same as the Widmar factual

11

MR. SMART:

We think that constitutionally it is

12

indistinguishable, Your Honor.

9
10

setting?

QUESTION:

13

I am speaking narrowly.

In the Widmar

14

case did the students decide what it was they wanted to talk

15

about?

16

MR. SMART:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SMART:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. SMART:

23

If they wanted to advance socialism, they

could do it?

19

22

That is exactly correct, Your Honor.

Yes, Your Honor.
They were free entirely, weren't they?
They were free entirely to conduct their

meetings as they saw fit.
We believe that the district court findings in this

24

case, that that was the case in the Williamsport Area High

25

School, and are correct; that the School District -8

1

3

QUESTION:

Did they have to do something?

Did they

have to go outside and sit on the steps?
MR. SMART:

No, Your Honor.

The only reason they

4

couldn't do that is because the school requires them to remain

5

in the building, as I understand it, and that is part of the

6

reason for having all the activities, as I understand it, inside

7

the building unless perhaps there is special permission to

8

go outside.

You mentioned that some of these youngsters

were in the ninth grade.

Do you carry your argument to the junior

MR. SMART:

Your Honor,, our case> concerns only age 14,

grade nine through twelve.
QUESTION:

Fourteen through 18 are the ages.

Suppose, as in another school district,

17

your high school consisted of grades ten, eleven aid twelve

18

and the junior high had nine as is the case in many communities.

19

Does your argument also carry you to uhe grade nine in those

20

communities?

21

MR. SMART:

No, it -- Well, it would depend on whether

22

the school had created a free-speech opportunity for the students

23

through some kind of self-initiated activity forum.

24

QUESTION;

25

second grades on that basis?

Then you would go down to the first and

MR. SMART:

No.

Probably the closest you would get

2

in elementary school to a student-initiated activity forum

3

would be recess.

4

QUESTION:

Suppose they wanted to play chess.

They

5

had a couple of chess prodigies and they formed a chess club

6

in the fifth grade.

7

Does your argument apply?

MR. SMART:

I think that there is going to be —

8

Of course, the Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals was concerned

9

about the impressionability and age of students and I would

10

have to frankly admit that I think there is some age at which
»

11

any sort of religious activities going on may reasonably be

12

interpreted by a student as having been sponsored by the school.

13

For instance, the case Judge Friendly decided involving

14

the kindergarten students where there was a claim that they

13

should be allowed to say a prayer before grace.

16

leads them in that prayer, why, it is not going to be a voluntary

1

7

f8

prayer.

At that age, nothing is voluntary to those students

unless they are maladjusted students.

Mr. Smart, in this case, a faculty member

was present at the Petros meetings.

Does the record disclose whether the teachers

Would your conclusion be the same if the

teacher had actively participated in the meeting?

7

MR. SMART:

No, Your Honor.

We believe that the

8

crucial constitutional distinction is the distinction between

9

state action or government action and individual action and

10

that the only safe harbor of constitutional analysis is that

11

distinction between is the government acting in promoting or

12

conducting this activity or are private individuals acting

and what is the government's role?

prerogative to do so because there is educational value even

it matter if the monitor was an employee of the school and

reconcile that with your response to Justice O'Connor's question.

MR. SMART:

I don't understand how you

I am not sure I understand the question.
The issue as you put it is whether it

is state action or not.

15

MR. SMART:

QUESTION:

That is right.
And, if it is action that is necessary

17

in order to have these students be qualified for a state diploma,

18

why is it not state action?

is there anything in the record to show what the teacher is

there for?

6

MR. SMART:

Yes, Your Honor.

It is clear from the

record the teacher was there and was instructed to simply be

8

there in case of an emergency, to make sure the students were

9

there and don't leave, that type of situation.

to keep the students on the premises.

something of this nature — I would hope the students wouldn't

Mr. Smart, I thought the record indicated

12

that the teacher was there to take the roll to make sure the

students were present and then to remain because of disciplinary

14

problems.

15

MR. SMART:

There is a reference in the record to

16

the teacher taking the roll, although I think that what actually

17

happened was that the students signed'a roster in actuality.

That doesn't mean they are monitoring with the speech of the

students in the hallway or censoring the speech of the students,

it simply means that they are there to Lake care of any need

QUESTION:

Mr. Smart, in the Appendix, pages 95 and

2

96, which is a deposition apparently, there is a question:

3

"Do you know of any — are there any school board policies

4

or regulations requiring adult supervision of student clubs

5

or student groups?

6

Answer:

"It doesn't need to be, it's covered fairly

7

adequately in state law.

8

by a professional employee of the commonwealth."

9
10

As I understand your answer, you are interpreting
the word "supervision" to mean just presence.

11

MR. SMART:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SMART:

14

17

That is my understanding, Your Honor.
Nothing else, just be there.
I think that fits the record in this

case.

15
16

Student groups must be supervised

QUESTION:

Hardly t.ie normal definition of supervision,

is it?
MR. SMART:

Well, Your Honor, I think that if you

18

look at the purpose of the activity period, it is not a curricular

activity period, it is an extra-curricular period, and —

QUESTION:

But, what is the situation.

I don't think

21

you answered Justice Stevens' question.

22

toward the required number of hours for the school to operate?

23

MR. SMART:

Does this hour count

It is my understanding that it does.

24

However, I would urge on the Court the fact that the School

25

District itself calls these periods extra-curr±^alar and I

2

QUESTION:

Well, if it is required, what importance

3

is the nomenclature the School Board puts on it as required

4

or not?

5

MR. SMART:

Well, I think the curricular/non-curricular

6

distinction is a distinction this Court has used in the past.

For instance, in the School Library case, the Board of Education

8

of Island Trees School

District versus Pico the Court did

10

The Court drew the distinction between the curricular activities

11

and the non-curricular activities.

12

And, the position of this Court has been that students

13

have free speech rights in the public school.

14

what the First Amendment requires in a public school is not

15

a highly regimented, dictatorial type of situation outside

16

of the classroom.

17

self-initiated activities or in the cafeteria, they are able

18

to excerise free-speech rights.

The school created that right here.

All we are asking

20

is that you not exclude one category, the religious student,

21

from participation in that right simply because of the

22

religiousness of it.

23
24
25

The Court has always held religious speech to the
same protection as other forms of speech.

The federal interest in this case is direct and sub­
stantial.

If the Court of Appeals is correct and the

10

Respondents are correct that the Establishment Clause forbids

11

what these students chose to do, wanted to do, that the school

12

authorities were perfectly willing to have them do until the

13

lawyer said otherwise, if the Court of Appeals is correct,

14

then the subsequently enacted Equal Access Act is under grave

15

constitutional doubt.

QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, may I ask if the federal interest

17

would be adequately satisfied by a decision that the Appellant

here didn't have standing to appeal and the judcment of the

19

Court of Appeals was vacated?

20

MR. FRIED:

The doubt which the Court of Appeals

21

has raised about the act would still be there.

22

itself would have been vacated and we would have to wait another

23

case in which the matter would be litigated.

how it would come out in the Third Circuit, would you?

MR. FRIED:

The case is a puzzle.

QUESTION:

I would not, sir.

I am not sure of what your answer is.

4

You don't think the federal interest would be adequately

5

vindicated by vacating the decision?

MR. FRIED:

The cloud would still be there, Justice

Stevens.

QUESTION:

MR. FRIED:

So, you would rather have an advisory —
On the jurisdictional point, Justice

10

Stevens, we do discuss that on page five of our brief.

11

is fairly intricate.

12

It

I would like to proceed to the rather puzzling point

13

in the Court of Appeals decision.

14

case we have had the new notion introduced that free speech

15

has got to be balanced against the Establishment Clause and,

16

indeed, that free speech must yield to the Establishment Clause.

17

One wonders why in this

This case is not like Wallace and Ja :free last term

18

or Stone v. Graham where the Court could point to a state statute

19

which the Court concluded sought by direction or indirection

20

to endorse religion.

21

And, indeed, this case is easier, should be viewed

22

as easier than its older twin brother, Widmar against Vincent,

23

because in Widmar the state had reasons of its own, quite

24

apart from rhe rederal Establishment Clause, for wishing to

25

limit the access of those students to their religious activities.

1

Here, the controverted action -- the controverted

2

activity was entirely student initiated and there was no state

3

objection apart from the lawyer's objection based on the federal

4

Establishment Clause.

5

So, here we have no endorsement of religious and

6

we have no conflict with a substantive state educational

7

policy.

8
9

If you compare this case to cases of incidental,
but permissible state involvement, tax exemption in Walz, school

10

books and text books for parochial school students, or the

11

use of the mall for a papal mass, one sees that the objective

12

involvement of the state is virtually negligible.

13

So, how is it that this case is thought to present

14

these agonizing constitutional difficulties.

15

and that is that high school students ire different.

16

is the fear that unlike the rest of us high school students

17

are unable to discern the difference between neutrality and

18

endorsement.

19

in its decision and that is the fear which is raised by the

20

Respondents and the amici in this case.

21

Only on one premise
There

That is the fear which moved the Court of Appeals

Now, whether that fear is justified, whether high

22

school students, indeed, are so immature that they cannot make

23

the distinctions that the rest of us make was a question which

24

•’0.2 specifically addressed by Congress.

25

testimony was taken, materials were examined.

Hearings were held,
And, Congress

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

concluded that high school students — secondary school students

2

was the word of the statute — are sufficiently mature to make

3

the same distinctions that the rest of us make,

4

us have to make when that papal mass was held on the mall,

5

to distinguish between state endorsement and state neutrality

6

towards religion.

7

that all of

And, this Court has consistently held, most recently

8

in Rostker and Goldberg, that where Congress has made a determi­

9

nation of a controverted matter of general fact, that disposition

10
11

is entitled to the very highest degree of deference.
This case cannot be affirmed without controverting

12

that congressional judgment about the maturity of secondary

13

school students and rejecting the major premise of the Equal

14

Access Act.

15
16
17

That is why I say the federal interest is direct
and substantial.
Now, once that factual premise is accepted, high

18

school students do understand the difference between neutrality

19

and endorsement, this becomes the easiest of cases for we are

20

far from any actual endorsement of religion in this case.

21

22
23

If the Court has no further questions, I thank you
for its attention.
QUESTION:

I do, Mr. Fried, if you have a moment.

24

You pointed out that this activity was entirely initiated by

25

the students.

To what extent was that point litigated in

QUESTION:

6

MR. FRIED:

The Petitioners in this case made —

Petitioners made that allegation and

it was not controverted and it was the basis for the District

Was any pleading filed other than the

Justice Stevens.
QUESTION:

Mr. Fried, I know that you passed over

20

the standing of jurisdiction question and referred to the

21

passage in the Solicitor General's brief on the subject.

22

it your view that a student who does not allege a desire to

23

attend a Petros meeting has standing to complain about the

24

fact that the school is holding such meetings or permitting

25

them if nothing else appears?
22

Is

MR. FRIED:

1

A student may allege an injury of a

2

constitutional dimension if that student alleges that the going

3

on of such activities in his school is, as it were, constitutionali

4

offensive to that student.
But, I should point out that in this case the Petros

MR. YOUNGMAN:

They took the deposition of the

QUESTION:

The Plaintiffs' lawyer took the deposition

of the principal.
MR. YOUNGMAN:

QUESTION:

16

Yes.

Whose deposition did they —

13

15

We had counsel employed to fight

this case.

6

10

Yes.

Yes.

Did the Defendants' lawyer take any

depositions?
MR. YOUNGMAN:

No, but the Defendants' lawyer procured

17

affidavits of both the principal and the superintendent, sub­

18

mitted papers and briefs, and argued the motion, the cross-motion

19

for summary judgment.

20
21

22

So, yes, they did participate and the Defendants
did participate.
I would like to call the Court's attention to the

23

Joint Appendix.

24

is the policy of the Williamsport School District regarding

25

student clubs and student meetings on public school grounds?"

At the bottom of page 63, Question:

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

"What

1

Answer:

"Policy has been that any group of students

2

that wishes a meeting within the confines of the building must

3

meet with a faculty advisor."

4

The point of this is that the forum as it existed,

5

that Williamsport High School, prior to the decision of the

6

District Court in this case, was that these clubs had advisors.

7
8

9

What is an advisor?

I direct your attention to page

83 of the record.
QUESTION:

Record of Appendix?

10

MR. YOUNGMAN:

11

Question:

Joint Appendix, excuse me.

"What sort of adult supervision does the

12

school district generally require of student groups, you might

13

have answered that before, but I don't remember."

14

Answer:

"Any group of students that meets within

15

the confines of the school district meets with an advisor,

16

a paid coach or somebody of that nature, somebody that is on

17

the faculty or somebody that is being hired by the Williamsport

18

Area School District to perform the function."

19

And, then on down the page, "Generally speaking,

20

do adult supervisors participate in the student group meetings

21

or activities?"

22

Answer:

"I would say yes.

If they are an advisor,

23

I would expect them to be there as somebody who's going to

24

help the students."

25

Question:

"Are there any student clubs for which
29

a

nr pQOK ipppoPTiNim rnMPANY iMr*

1

the faculty advisor is instructed not to participate?"

2

Answer:

3

And, then a question is "Are these advisors hall

4

monitors?"

5

6

"Not to my knowledge."

Answer:

"I do not look upon advisors as hall monitors.

I think they are there to help the activities."

7

That was the forum as it existed at Williamsport

8

High School prior to the decision of the District Court in

9

this case.

10

Petros did not meet until after the District Court —

11

other than informally — until after the District Court decided

12

this case and issued its order.

13
14
15

So, the District Court in this case altered the forum
as it existed.
The relevance of that is that it is our position

16

that the Petitioners must live with the forum as it existed

17

and that forum was to have advisors.

18

Board wants to have structure and direction given in the

19

educational process and that occurred in these clubs before

20

the District Court's order in this case and it is our contention

21

that that should occur and that by the District Court's altering

22

the forum it puts — in effect, gives the Petitioners the right

23

to negotiate as to how the forum will be and that is not

24

consonant with the basic pvrpore of public education.

25

QUESTION:

Why?

Because the School

That is right.

Did the Court of Appeals disagree with

any of the District Court's factual —
MR. YOUNGMAN:

The Court of Appeals did not disagree,

23

however, we believe that the Court of Appeals misread the

24

nature of the forum.

25

QUESTION:

Well, then, you are asking us to upset
31

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

a finding made by the District Court and not upset by the

2

Court of Appeals?

3

MR. YOUNGMAN:

4

QUESTION:

5

or do you have other grounds?

6
7

That is correct.

And, if we don't do that, do you lose

MR. YOUNGMAN:

We certainly have other grounds, Justice

White.

8
9

That is correct.

If there is — It is our position here that there
is an Establishment violation, whether or not there was a public

10

forum or not, and that is based on the nature of the forum

11

as it existed at Williamsport High School.

12

We believe that when an advisor is present to help

13

the students, this objectively is sponsoring and advancing

14

religion.

15

In addition, I would point out on page 76 of the

16

record with respect to this advisor the answer of Mr. Newton,

17

the Principal, to Mr. Seevers' question.

18

"Do you make, you and the other principals or

19

supervisors, actively check, attend, periodically, student

20

groups to make sure that the speech which is going on is what

21

you consider proper?"

22

Answer:

"I would say that the very rule that we

23

have with regard to any group must meet with a faculty advisor

24

gives uc direct input as to what is going on."

25

And, then, there is a stipulation in this case, found
32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

on page 144 of the Appendix with respect to this advisor

2

situation.

3

There is

Reading in the middle of Paragraph One,

4

Faculty Advisors:

5

of the Williamsport Area High School that each student club

6

have an adult advisor who is generally a faculty member or

7

another employee of the school district.

8

stances, parents of student club members serve as adult

9

advisors."

10

"There is, however, an unwritten policy

And, then in the next paragraph:

In some circum­

"Selection is based

11

upon the nature of the particular club and corresponding back­

12

ground of the faculty member.

13

a particular adult advisor, the principal and his staff have

14

final approval as to whom will serve as an advisor to a

15

student club."

16

Although students may request

Then, I would like to point out on page 65 of the

17

Appendix that the nature of the forum as it existed in the

18

question:

19

Democrats or Young Republicans, something of that nature."

"Are there any political clubs such as the Young

20

"No. "

21

And, —

22

QUESTION:

Now, do you mean by that, if you will

23

clear it up for me, that if the faculty member was there they

24

can participate in the debate of the students on a political

25

issue?
33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

MR. YOUNGMAN:

And do.

That is correct, Chief

Justice.

3

QUESTION:

So, if the faculty advisor had republican

4

leanings, he could — or she — could influence the line of

5

discussion, is that what you are suggesting?

6

MR. YOUNGMAN:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. YOUNGMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

Well, there was nc Republican Club.

I am giving you a hypothetical.
If —

They could have one, could they not,

a Republican or a Democratic Club?

11

MR. YOUNGMAN:

They could have had one, but that

12

was not the nature of the forum as it existed at Williamsport

13

High School.

14

QUESTION:

But, we are concerned here with the scope

15

of the authority as well as what really took place.

16

18

are Democrats and we will call ourselves Republicans and have

what would have happened in that case.

25

Could a group of students get

They could do that under this arrangement?

So, clear

wk.

Well, can you suggest anything in the

YOUNGMAN:

There is nothing except that the clubs

that were in this forum were uncontroversial and I believe
34
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

that the School Board would not have opened this forum

2

generally to First Amendment speech on the ground that they

3

would not have wanted to promote controversy and devisiveness.

4
5

6

The purpose of the forum was to examine — First
of all, to expand on directly curricular activities.
QUESTION:

Do you suggest the school performs its

7

function of getting young people ready for citizenship if it

8

would forbid a group to get together, one asserting a democratic

9

position and one asserting a republican position and perhaps

10

someone asserting a socialist position?

11

could prohibit that?

12

MR. YOUNGMAN:

Do you think they

If there were a non-public forum,

13

I believe, yes.

14

prohibit that absent a public forum.

15

forum, then, no.

That is my position.

And, I think they could
If there was a public

The answer to that is no.

16

I would also like to call the attention of the Court

17

to the Joint Appendix at page 104, the second paragraph, which

18

is an affidavit of Wayne E. Newton, the Principal of the school,

19

the last paragraph prior to III.

20

"Any student activity or club which is considered

21

to contribute to the intellectual, physical or social

22

development of the students and is otherwise considered legal

23

and constitutionally proper would likely be approved as an

24

officially sponsored and sanctioned school activity."

25

That was also the nature of the clubs.

They were

35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

approved, they were sponsored, and that is the nature of the

2

public school.

3

people understand that what goes on there is approved and

There is structure, there is direction, and

That is the nature.

Let me come back to this other question

because I am perplexed by your responses.

Would that be permitted?
My reaction is that that would be

permitted.

QUESTION:

16

MR. YOUNGMAN:

How could you discuss that —
But, it would be — The point is it

17

would have an advisor there anu would be subject co structure

18

and direction from the School District.

19

We, as a School Board, were not going to give up

20

our right to give structure and direction to the education

21

that was going on in the public school.

22

believe me, the parents would have been in on us the next day

23

complaining loudly and bitterly about having a situation where

24

there was no direction being applied at the school.

25

QUESTION:

If that had happened,

What if the student group wasn't going
36

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

to have a debate about the budget but it was students against

2

taxation and they wanted to have their meeting like all the

3

other groups around and that is how they can oppose taxation?
Now, suppose the school approved, sent an advisor

4
5

there, take the roll, do you think that the public would think

6

that the views expressed at that meeting were the school's

7

views?

8

MR. YOUNGMAN:

9

QUESTION:

I don't think so.

I don't think so.

What makes you think that the ordinary

10

member of the public would think that the views expressed at

11

this — what is the name of the group, Petros?

12

MR. YOUNGMAN:

13

QUESTION:

14

Why would the public think that the views

expressed there were the school's?

Petros.

MR. YOUNGMAN:

The problem isn't the public, Justice

White.

QUESTION:

18

MR. YOUNGMAN:

QUESTION:

What is it?
It is the students themselves.

Well, all right, the students.

Do you

think the students in my other example

other students would think the school was espousing the views

expressed at that meeting against taxation of any kind?

(Laughter)

10

QUESTION:

That is kind of silly, isn't it?

11

MR. YOUNGMAN:

Well, it is silly until you consider

12

the nature of public high schools.

13

the gambit from educable mentally retarded to gifted and the

14

perceptions of those kinds of children, especially at the lower

15

end of the intellectual scale, are very much more subject to

impressionability than — It seems ridiculous to think that

MR. YOUNGMAN:

That

No, Mr. Chief Justice, but some

accommodation has to be given to that situation, just as I

don't think you should gear the standard to the highest level,

basis.

Well, what if in the next room beside —

along side the group of Against All

is — It is called the Committee for Fair Taxation and they —

think the school is endorsing?

12

Now, which group is another student going to

MR. YOUNGMAN:
QUESTION:

Taxation is a group that

There —

You mean some might think one and some

might think the other.
MR. YOUNGMAN:

You have opposites in the forum and

13

there it is more difficult, I grant.

14

think that ••.he school was endorsing one and some the other,

15

unless they also understood that both groups were there and

16

understood the purpose of both groups.

17

QUESTION:

But, some students would

Well, in judging the effect of a particular

18

course of conduct for Establishment Clause purposes, wouldn't

19

we apply an objective test that would ask what a reasonable

20

student would think?

21

MR. YOUNGMAN:

Well, you would apply an objective

22

test, that is true.

23

but you would also apply the subjective test, which is what

24

would the students, as they exist at the high school,

25

reasonably perceive from the activity that was going on and

That is one of the tests you would apply,

discount the fact that you do have the low end of the spectrum

9

And, that is the nature of public

It educates everyone.
QUESTION:

Mr. Youngman, in defending this case,

10

was any effort made to bring out evidence that would support

11

the suggestion you are making that some of the high school

12

students would perceive endorsement?

13

record to support that, is there?

14

MR. YOUNGMAN:

15

QUESTION:

16
17

There is nothing in the

No.

The Court of Appeals certainly made a

lot of it.
MR. YOUNGMAN:

That is rijht.

that is something that I think thij Court has to determine

19

whether it should take judicial notice of.

20
21

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

Even though nobody in the trial of the

case thought it important enough —
MR. YOUNGMAN:

Even though the record doesn't have

expert testimony in this regard.
I will say this, that the record in the Equal Access
Act is j.n some ways equally deficient.

That is I am not

sure that this is the kind of thing that can be quantified

2

that way.

3

brought up kids between the ages of 14 and 18, you know they

4

are impressionable.

5

QUESTION:

It is a matter of if you brought up students or

But, Mr. Youngman, isn't it true that

6

this program was permitted to operate for about a year after

7

the District Court decision and there is nothing in the record

8

to suggest anybody was even remotely unhappy about it in any

9

way, got any misperceptions or anything.

Nobody thought to

10

supplement the record after the program had been going for

11

a year either.

12

MR. YOUNGMAN:

That is true.

And, I would suggest

13

that one of the reasons for that is that this matter was in

14

litigation and that you did not have another religious club

15

or a group of religious clubs as I feel you would have to have

16

which will inevitably result if this — if the decision of

17

the Circuit Court is reversed.

18

That is my reasoning, Justice Stevens, for that —

19

QUESTION:

20
21

22

Does the record tell us anything about

the attendance during that year, how popular the group was?
MR. YOUNGMAN:

The record says that the club did

not exceed 45 members.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. YOUNGMAN:

25

QUESTION:

That was at the very first meeting.
That is right.

There were about 20 at the second meeting
41

and they met for a year.

MR. YOUNGMAN:

No, the record doesn't show how many

met.
QUESTION:

6

Do we know how many people during

We don't know if it is two or three or

twenty or thirty.
MR. YOUNGMAN:

7

You don't know that from the record.

8

I suspect it was between twenty and forty-five, a relatively

9

small number.
But, the fact of the matter is this matter was in

10
11

litigation and I think that there was an inhibiting effect

12

of that and that is why you haven't had the others come in

13

and ask for access which I fully expect to happen if this case

14

is reversed.
QUESTION:

15

May I ask this question?

Do you agree

16

with the Court of Appeals that the only difference between

17

this case and Widnar is the age of tne students?

18

MR. YOUNGMAN:

No.

I think Widmar is distinguished

19

also by the very nature of public schools as opposed to the

20

university.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. YOUNGMAN:

23

right.

Without regard to the age of the children?
Without regard to the age, that is

Well, it has to do with age, but it

is the point.

QUESTION:

The test turns in this case solely on

MR. YOUNGMAN:

No, it also turns —

The Court of Appeals said that explicitly.

MR. YOUNGMAN:

QUESTION:

I think it should turn on the nature of

Who finances the University of Missouri,

taxpayers, the same as the grade school and high school?
MR. YOUNGMAN:

As I understand it, the taxpayers

did finance the university.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. YOUNGMAN:

It is a public school?
That is correct, that is correct,

19

but the university situation is different from the secondary

20

and elementary education provided in the compulsory attendance

21

setting and there is just no way to avoid that.

22

QUESTION:

Mr. Youngman, suppose we reverse the Court

3

Would the District Court's decision stand as a bar

MR. YOUNGMAN:

District and Circuit Court's decision

4

with respect to the open forum question would mean that any

First Amendment club has a right to be in that forum.

6
7

QUESTION:

So, the free-speech interest would get

them into the school regardless of the wishes of the school?

8

MR. YOUNGMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

That is correct.

At least that is what the two courts below

said.

11

MR. YOUNGMAN:

That is right.

You would leave no

discretion to the School Board in the running of the educational

process in that particular forum.

MR. SMART:

Your Honor, I do not believe that they

could articulate a valid reason for having only secular activities

9

I also think it would create Establishment Clause

10

problems with regard to excessive entanglement of determining

11

what is religious and what is not religious as the Court

12

discussed in the Widma.r case.

3

MR. SMART:

Our clients have never sought that right.
QUESTION:

I know they hctven't sought it, but assume

4

they did seek it.

5

and, if not, why not?

6

No, Your Honor, that is not in this case.

Would they not have the same right as others

MR. SMART:

If our students had sought that right,

7

then I think this Court would want to know more about the details

8

of how that is administered, who puts the notices up there,

9

who determines what is up there, and that sort of thing.

10

We would argue that if it is the students putting

11

the notices up there, then the concept of neutrality, if everyone

12

realizes this is the students' bulletin board and they can

13

put whatever they want to up there, then the concept of neutrality

14

requires that they heve equal access to that bulletin board.

15
16
17

If there were more government involvement in the
board, then it might be a different question.
QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Smart, under your view, would

18

the Board have to permit some group such as Sons of Satan or

19

whatever it might be that would be entirely anti-religious

20

to come and meet?

MR. SMART:

have to permit that.

MR. SMART:

Yes, Your Honor, the School Board would

Or a neo-Nazi party?
Or a nec-Nazi party unless the School

Board can articulate a compelling interest.

And, the School

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Board would probably have two options in that regard.

2

one, a hate group or something of that nature might present

3

a compelling state interest to keep them out or a school district

4

could always go to a parental consent format if it was causing

5

a lot of political turmoil for the school board to have such

6

a group.

7

I think that would be an easier way.

It would keep

8

the government from prescribing what is orthodox.

9

the issue is —

MR. SMART:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. SMART:

16
17

Both sides in the District Court I think,

in effect, agreed that at least that was not contested.
QUESTION:

So, perhaps it isn't necessary in this

case to wre>tle with all those problems.
MR. SMART:

21

Did both parties agree?
Both sides.

20

I think

Did both parties here agree that in this

Number

That is exactly right.
The only barrier is the Establishment

Clause now?
MR. SMART:

The only thing we are asking this Court

22

is to decide that our group does not face any additional barrier

23

because of the Establishment Clause.

24

whether any kind of an open forum had been created at all,
48

I suppose, in support of the

judgment below, he could argue it here.
MR. SMART:
