would like to explain why the First Circuit has

The Respondent, Brian Bur bine, was arrested

with two other men on a breaking and entering charge by

the Cranston police.

11

and he was -- the other two men were interrogated by the

12

Cranston police.

13

there was suspect cast on Brian Burbine that he might be

14

a suspect in a murder that had taken place in a

15

neighboring town — city of Providence three months

16

prior to his present arrest.

He was taken to the police station

She said she asked for the detective division

and somebody, a male voice, answered "detectives," said

5

that, yes, he was being held.

Casparian was the attorney whc represented Burtine, he

7

was not available, but if he was to be placed in a

lineup or further interrogated that evening she would be

She said, although

that he was not going to be further interrogated that

He still said, he did net want an attorney.

3

But at this time, whan he was told that he must have

4

one, he mentioned Cacparian's name and the public

5

defender's office was contacted.
All of the police who testified at the

6

suppression hearing in this case, the Cranston

8

detectives and the Providence detectives, claimed that

9

they had not received a telephone call from the

10

attorney, nor did they know anything about it.

this call had never been made.

stating that the Mirania rights are personal rights and

that he had the right to waive them, and that it hardly

12

MRS.

13

That was a three to two decision?

wESS0RE;

That's correct. Your Honor, it

was.
The federal district court, giving substantial

14
15

deference to the state court's finding of historical

16

fact, agreed with the Rhode Island Supreme Court and

17

they did not grant his petition for a writ of habeas

18

corpus.

19

But the First Circuit court reversed and they

20

gave what they described as a. limited ruling when they

21

said deliberate or reckless misleading of an attorney

22

who has a legitimate professionally ethical

23

that exchange to the suspect, is more than just one

2

factor in the calculus of waiver.

This combination of circumstances, the First

Circuit said, clearly vitiates any claim that a waiver

Mrs. Messore, do you think this

7

case would he any different from your perspective if the

8

defendant had actually engaged an attorney or had

9

reached arrangements with someone specifically to

10

represent him and the police acted as they did here in

11

refusing to let the attorney see the defendant?
MRS. MESSORE*

MRS.

16

MESSORE*

Well, I'm afraid I don't really

17

understand that.

18

we would say here that Casparian was his attorney -- and

19

then he was arrested and brought to the police station,

20

that, no, the police -- our argument would be that the

21

attorney had no right at that particular time to see him

22

unless he himself requested the attorney.

regardless of the degree or extent of the deception by

2

the police?

Is there any point at which you would —

3

MBS. MKSSORE4

Our argument would be the same.

4

Your Honor, in any circumstaaces.
The ruling of the First Circuit gees way

5
6

beyond the purpose of Miranda, we maintain, because

7

Miranda when it extended into the police station these

8

procedural safeguards to prevent the police from

9

violating a suspect's right to be .free from coerced

10

self-incrimination guaranteed to him under the Fifth

11

Amendment, these procedural guidelines and Miranda

12

rights were to protect his rights when he was in custody

13

and when he was being subjected to interrogation.
But they ware also to provide the police with

14
15

guide-lines, or these bright-line rules, as they're

16

called, which could be readily understood and easily

17

applied by the police, and thereby relieve them, and the

18

lower courts from making exceedingly difficult case by

19

case judgments as to whether a particular confession was

20

v oluntar y.

21

The police are required to give the well-known

22

Miranda warnings and any time that they did not give

23

these warnings obviously his confession would have been

24

inadmissible.

25

themselves rights protected by the Constitution.

Put these Miranda warnings are not

They’re only the procedural safeguards designed to

2

provide a practical rainfores ment for his right against

4

And Burbine was given these rights verbally at

5

least three times.

He was told that he could stop in the middle

12

of the questioning any time that he wished

to, and

again, do you understand that you do have a right to an

attorney, and he said yes.

15

So our argument is that he certainly well

18

QUESTION;

Nell, even if you're right on the

19

Fifth Amendment point, what about the Sixth Amendment?

20

And do the cases of this Court leave open, in your view,

21

any question about, whether the Sixth Amendment protects

22

an established attorney-clieat relationship from state

23

interference with it?

24
25

Is that question open?

You want us to assume

there was an established attorney-client relationship

here, do you?
MRS. MESSORE*

2

Well, originally in the state

3

court it was argued that there was not, and T

believe

4

the state court found that there was not.

5

federal district court received this case, apparently

6

for some reason -- and T*m not familiar with the tactics

7

of the persons that handled this case -- they decided tc

8

drop that argument.

9

QUESTION*

Rut when the

Well, how do you propose that we

10

treat it for purposes of the Sixth Amendment, as though

11

there is an established attor ney-cl ien t relationship

12

here?

13

MRS. MESSORE*

I think for this case certainly

14

we'll have to accept that.

15

Amendment we will claim does not apply tc this

16

particular case because adversarial proceedinos had not

yet been instituted against him.

19

MRS. MESSOSE *

20

QUESTION*

Rut I would say the Sixth

Well, you're relying on Gcuveia.
That's right, Your Honor.

But you recognize that there could

21

be an established attorney-client relationship before a

22

formal proceeding in court?

23

MRS. MESSORE*

24

QUESTION*

25

Yes, I do.

And you think, that the state at

that stage is free to interfere with that relationship?

KBS. MESSORE;

2

QUESTION;

3

KBS. KFSSOFE;

Under the Fifth Amendment --

Under the Sixth Amendment?
Under the Sixth Amendment, yes,

4

I think until the adversarial proceedings or a. lineup

5

have been instituted against him that he is net entitled

6

to have that attorney unless he requests the attorney’s

7

presence, if he has been given his complete Miranda

8

rights, of course.
QUESTION;

9

Kell, I had thought those cases

10

were dealing with whan an attorney had to be provided,

11

but had not decided the question of state interference

12

with an existing relationship before that time if it

13

existed.

14

KRS. MESSORE;

We don’t argue that he’s

15

entitled to this attorney until the adversarial

16

proceedings have been instituted, whether or not he has

17

been retained in the past.

18

QUESTION;

I'm still confused a little bit.

19

Perhaps I didn't hear you correctly.

20

that there was an established attorney-client

21

relationship here, or do you take the position that it

22

has not been established.

23

KBS. MESSORE;

Do you concede

I think I’m bound to in this

24

position, Your honor, because the state when this case

2
3

Even though

the prisoner didn't

know it?

4

MRS. MESSORE;

Bell, in his own mind, he knew

5

he had an appointment with an attorney that, afternoon.

6

He certainly knew there was one available to him and one

7

who was dealing with him on another criminal matter.

8

he certainly knew that there was an attorney available

9

and he knew of an attorney by name.

10
11

So

Bell, he didn't know he was

available for this action.

12

MRS.

MESSORE;

13

QUESTION:

Bell, he didn't request him.

Well, he didn't even know he was

14

available for this action.

He didn’t know whether the

15

23

including the First Circuit, found that this was a valid

24

But the First Circuit is the first

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

court that felt that this particular call changed the

2

outlook of the case.

3

The police neglect in telling Burbine of the

4

attorney's call was not an inherently coercive action

5

directed towards him which could produce a per se

6

involuntariness or overbear his will and capacity for

7

self-determination, and we argue that any Fifth

8

Amendment situation must have an element of coercion in

9

it to say that he has not knowingly and willingly waived

10
11

his rights.
The action of the police in providing this

12

information to the attorney, which is what the suspect

13

in this case is complaining of, we say was not improper

14

under the Fifth Amendment, because even the First

15

Circuit said;

rights of the suspect.

As long as he is given the

Hr. Chief Justice and may it please

I wasn't planning to address the Sixth

8

Amendment issue, but in response to your question let me

9

just say that I think that what triggers the Sixth

10

Amendment is the existence of a criminal prosecution,

11

not the existence of an attorney-client relationship.

12

The Sixth Amendment I believe simply -QUESTION;

13
14

Well, here we have an arrest and an

interrogation and an attorney-client relationship.
MR. FREY;

15

Yes, and none of those things are

16

enough to trigger the Sixth Amendment.

17

addresses that issue than the Seventh Amendment does.

18

It simply -- and I believe that the way Gouveia dealt

19

with Escobedo would establish that.

20

was I think an existing attorney-client relationship,

21

are considered, the conclusion that the First Circuit

2

erred in this case is logically inescapable.

3

all, the Court has said too many times tc leave the

4

issue in any doubt that there’s no constitutional policy

5

against obtaining and using voluntary confessions.

6

Similarly, it has repeatedly said that the

7

purpose of Miranda is to protect the Fifth Amendment

8

privilege against compelled self-incrimination; that the

9

requirement of warnings and waivers represents a means

10

of ensuring that the elements of compulsion in the

11

stationhouse interrogation have been satisfactorily

12

counteracted.

13

Thirdly, the Court has made it perfectly clear

14

that you do not need a lawyer to waive your rights to a

15

lawyer or to waive your other Miranda rights.

16

the notion that Miranda creates a right to counsel is I

17

think a fundamental misunderstanding of the parties on

18

the other side of this case.

constitutionally created right of an arrested suspect to

Therefore, in terms of the voluntariness or the

degree to which he may have been coerced, there simply

is no possible effect of the failure to tell him.

Now, in this case we've argued

If you had a waiver
