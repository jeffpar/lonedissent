ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK C. WOODSIDE, III, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. WOODSIDE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, in order to understand the pendent and

11

federal question jurisdictional issues involved in this

12

matter, it is first necessary to briefly understand the

13

history of this litigation.

14

Bendectin was a medicine manufactured by

15

Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals in the United States which

16

was for the treatment of morning sickness in pregnant

17

women.

18

Canadian bendectin.

19

equivalent product manufactured in Scotland.

21

Canadian individuals.

22

There are several counterparts.

There is

There was Debendox, which is an

The litigation involving the American claims

23

was originally consolidated pursuant to a -- before the

24

Honorable Carl Ruben in Cincinnati, Ohio.

25

approximately the same time there were a series of cases

5

Ruben, after the cases had been -- after the foreign

6

cases had been transferred to the Southern District of

7

Ohio, a motion to dismiss on the basis of forum non

plaintiffs is from Scotland, took Debendox, the other

21

plaintiff was from Canada and took Canadian Bendectin.

22

In the complaints which these two plaintiffs

23

filed, and by the way they are virtually identical and

24

were filed by the same counsel, there are six causes of

25

action asserted.

And they were filed in state court on September
As I have indicated previously, one of the

In these complaints there is

implication that the drug which was used was the

2

American version of Benaectin, ana the American

3

defendant, Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the

4

American company was the defendant.

5

The fourth cause of action states that the

6

petitioner in the instant action is liable for

7

violations of a breach of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

8

Act, and that as a result it is presumptively

9

negligent.

When those cases were filed, a removal

10

petition was placed of record, ana the cases were

11

transferred to Judge Ruben in the Southern District of

12

Ohio for the filing in Hamilton County, Ohio, in the

13

Court of Common Pleas.
After they had been removed, two things

happened.

remand, and the petitioner filed a motion to dismiss

17

based upon the document ana forum non conveniens.

18

Ruben ruled that the right to relief asserted by the

19

plaintiffs in their fourth cause of action dependea upon

20

application of the laws of the United States, and he

21

then determined there was federal question jurisaiction,

22

therefore overruled the motion of the respondent to

23

remand the cases and then dismissed the cases on the

24

basis of formula and convenience.

Judge

1

appealed by the respondents to the United States Court

2

of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

3

ruled that -- actually, what the Sixth Circuit did is,

4

they did not take issue -- I am not saying they agreed

5

with it -- they did not take issue with Judge Ruben's

6

determination that there was a federal question.

7

The Sixth Circuit

Instead what they did was, they stated that

8

the various causes of action, of which there were six,

9

should be considered collectively.

Now, the first cause

10

of action in these particular cases is a regular

11

negligence cause of action which alleged that Merrell

12

Dow was negligent in the design, manufacture, sale, and

13

distribution of the product.

14
15
16

The Court of Appeals ruled that since the
fourth cause of action stated — strike that.
The Court of Appeals ruled that the sixth --

17

excuse me -- the fourth cause of action was a negligence

18

action, a negligence per se action in which the

19

respondents had stated that there was negligence per se

20

because of violation of the Food, Drug, ano Cosmetic Act

21

of this country.

22

the first cause of action was also a negligence action,

23

that — ^nd since the respondents could recover fully

24

and completely for negligence on that first cause of

25

action, that because of this parallel pleading, it was

The Court of Appeals said that since

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

not necessary tor there to be a resolution of the

2

substantial federal -- question of federal law in order

3

for the plaintiffs below to prevail on a negligence

4

theory/ and therefore it determined that there was no

5

federal question of jurisdiction, and reversed the

6

decision of Judge Ruben and remanded the cases back to

7

the state court, and then we filed the petition for writ

8

of certiorari.

9

Now, it is our position in this litigation

10

that the plaintiff's right to relief under the fourth

11

cause of action necessarily depends on the resolution of

12

a substantial question of federal law.

13

QUESTION:

Why do we have to decide that if

14

all the Court of Appeals held, as you have said, is that

15

we do not need to decide anything about the fourth cause

16

of action because of the first, because they could

17

recover on a state cause of action?

18

MR. WOODSIDE:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Yes, sir, that --

Apparently you wouldn't be

satisfied with our just reversing that holding.
MR. WOODSIDE:

Well, let me respond this way.

22

In point of fact, the situation is, one way to respond

23

would be to say that the consideration by the Court of

24

Appeals that pleading alternative causes of action

25

creates a situation where there is no federal
7

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

jurisdiction is not in accord with the Franchise Tax

2

Board decision.

3

See, what the Court of Appeals --

QUESTION:

Well, suppose it isn't.

What if we

4

just reversed the Court of Appeals insofar as it held

5

that just because there was a state cause of action

6

stated, they didn't neea to determine if there was a

7

federal one?
MR. WOODSIDE:

8
9

Your Honor, in all candor, I am

not certain I understand the question.

If you ao that,

10

then the action would be, if the Court of Appeals

11

reversed —
QUESTION:

12

Well, we would just tell the Court

13

of Appeals it should have deciaed whether the fourth

14

cause of action stated a federal question.

15

MR. WOODSIDE:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WOODSIDE:

Oh, I understand.

Which it didn't decide, did it?
Well, we don't know for

18

certain.

19

that, although they didn't say so in their opinion,

20

because, Your Honor, if they hadn't done that, then it

21

would not have been necessary to determine that there

22

were parallel claims -- for instance, if they had

23

determined that the fourth cause of action did not state
,

I think they probably had to to have done

'

24

a federal claim, if they had so ruled, they would not

25

have gotten to the basis for their decision.
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

They would

1

have -- so that there was implied in the decision -QUESTION:

2

I just don't understand that at

3

all.

They could easily say, even if the fourth cause of

4

action states a federal question, the fact that there is

5

a first cause of action stated in the complaint means

6

that there is no federal jurisdiction.
MR. WOODSIDE:

7

But you see, Your Honor, under

8

the Franchise Tax Board decision, the court has to

9

consider each of the individual claims for relief.

10

QUESTION:

I agree with you.

11

MR. WOODSIDE:

Maybe you and I agree.

I think

12

the situation is, if that happened, then the case would

13

be reversed and the dismissal on the basis of forum non

14

conveniens would be reinstated, which would be tine --

15

the forum non conveniens decision was never appealed to

16

the Court of Appeals.

17

think, the federal question involved here -- there are

18

several federal questions involved.

19

situation, where faced with a set of facts wherein the

20

drug which was allegedly ingested by the two mothers,

21

the drug which allegedly caused the problem, was not

22

manufactured, was not distributed, was not sold by the

23

defendant.

24
25

See, but more importantly, I

In this particular

It was sold by independent subsidiaries.
While the plaintiffs below allege that the

activities of companies in the United Kingdom, Scotland,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

and the activities of companies in Canada are subject to

2

the regulations and the statutes of the Food, Drug, and

3

Cosmetic Act, that, the federal question there is

4

whether or not there is then an extraterritorial

5

imposition on companies abroad of the safety statutes of

6

this country.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. WOODSIDE:

9

QUESTION:

Mr. Woodside.
Yes, sir.

It seems to me I can remember as

10

long ago as I was in law school, which is a long time

11

ago, reading a case involving some sort of a maritime

12

collision, but it wasn't an aamiralty case, it was a

13

diversity case in a federal court, and the claim was

14

that the operator of the boat hadn't steerea the boat

15

well, and also that it violated a Coast Guard standard.

16

And there was no thought in that case that there was any

17

federal jurisdiction other than by diversity.
You plead negligence and you say the want of

18
19

due care, and you say violation of a state statutory

20

standard, you say violation of a federal statutory

21

standard.

22

the violation of a federal statutory standard to prove

23

negligence you have stated a federal claim?

24
25

Is your position that every time you invoke

MR. WOODSIDE:

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

point of fact, we submit that there are very, very few
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

In

1

situations in which an allegation of negligence based

2

upon a violation of a saftey statute would create

3

federal question jurisdiction.

4

the plaintiff's right to relief must necessarily depend

5

on resolution of a substantial question of federal law.

6

Now, if you take the situation you have talked about, or

7

if you talk about the numerous decisions of trial courts

8

and courts of appeals and even this Court to some

9

extent, in which there are allegations in the complaint

What we state is that

10

of negligence based upon violations of the Safety

11

Appliances Act.
Now, you see, the Safety Appliances Act, for

12

13

instance, it usually comes up, of course, in FELA cases,

14

it is only a factual question.

15

-- there is a -- the law concerning them is well

16

settled, so the question simply is, aid the person

17

violate that statute.

18

her e.

19

QUESTION:

The statutes are simply

We don't have that situation

So federal question jurisdiction

20

depends on whether the federal statute to which you

21

refer in your negligence claim has a settled

22

construction or an unsettled construction?

23

MR. WOODSIDE:

Well, to some extent.

What I

24

believe the case law says is this.

If you have a

25

situation where there is settled construction, so that
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

really there is left to the jury simply a factual

2

determination as to whether or not the statute was

3

violated, then in that situation we would not take the

4

position that there is federal question jurisdiction,

5

but in this particular situation here you ao not get to

6

that question very easily.

7

question of what the court should charge the jury on

8

because first of all you have got to determine several

9

federal questions.

You do not get to the

First of all, is there an

10

extraterritorial application of the Food, Drug, and

11

Cosmetic Act.

12

citizens in this case of Canada or Scotland, are they

13

within the zone of individuals who are protected?

14

best their position in that regard would be tenuous.

Second of all, are foreign citizens,

QUESTION:

15

May I interrupt you there for a

16

moment?

17

claim there is a private cause of action.

How does that bear on the case?

MR. WOODSIDE:

18

At

You do not

Absolutely not, but you see, in

19

this particular situation, it is alleged that Merrell

20

Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., violated the provisions of

21

the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and as a result of

22

those violations the company is presumed to be

23

negligent, a rebuttable presumption, and that as a

24

result of that violation, the plaintiffs have sustained

25

damages.

So the first question that must be addressed -12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION:

1
2

How is that different from the case

Justice Rehnquist asked you about?
MR. WOODSIDE:

3

Oh, because in the case that he

4

askea me about, the law is settled.

Let me go back ano

5

pose a little bit different situation, if I may, but it

6

is right on point.

7

involving the Safety Appliances Act, it is alleged in

8

the complaints there are violations of those Acts, and

9

as a result of that the defendant is liable.

In some of the railroad cases

Now, some of those alleged violations are

10
11

because the railroad cars don't have the appropriate

12

coupling devices, and so the judge merely charges the

13

jury -- didn't violate this -- we don't have that

14

situation, because here it has to be a judicial

15

determination as to whether or not the provisions of the

16

Food, Drug, ano Cosmetic Act even apply —
QUESTION:

17

But even if you assume they do

18

apply, where does that get you?

19

you to the threshold of your safety appliance cases

20

where everybody acknowledges the statute applies, but

21

proving a violation doesn't establish a right to

22

relief.

23

MR. WOODSIDE:

Doesn't that just get

Well, Your Honor, the problem

24

is, you can't just presume it applies.

25

federal question.

That is the

The federal question is whether or
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

not that statute or the provisions of that statute were
applied.

It is not a mere factual situation where the

trial court can charge the jury.

This is a situation

that they violated the Safety Appliances Act dealing
with couplers, they are negligent because that would be
an American case with American companies.

This is a

situation where we are alleged to be liable for a drug
we didn't make, we didn't distribute, and we didn't
sell.

And what the plaintiffs have really done is

export federal statutes to situations involving foreign
countries, and in essence import foreign litigation and
then take the position that Merrell Dow, the petitioner
in this matter, is liable for violation of a statute
which it didn't have anything to oo with.
QUESTION:
the statute.
liable at all.

It is not liable for violation of

It is liable for negligence if it is
Isn't that right?

MR. WOODSIDE:
QUESTION:

Your Honor —

I thought you agreed a moment ago

there is no private cause of action for a violation of
the federal statute.
MR. WOODSIDE:

That is absolutely correct.

response to your question, or your statement, let me
compare the first and the fourth cause of action.
first cause of action is very simple.

It does say we

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

The

(202) 628-9300

In

are alleged to be negligent in the manufacture, sale,

2

design, and distribution of drugs.

3

In the fourth cause of action, it is stated that we,

4

Merrell Dow has violated the provisions of the Food,

5

Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

6

injury occurred because of the violation of the Act.

7

doesn't say that because we were negligent in

8

manufacture, sale, and distribution.

9

is not the same as negligence in the ordinary sense, and

10

Classic negligence.

As a result, it is alleged that

Negligence per se

therein lines —
QUESTION:

11

Yes, but if they prove a violation

12

of the Act and they fail to prove negligence, they

13

cannot recover unless there is a cause of action unaer

14

the Act, can they?
MR. WOODSIDE:

15
16
17
18

It

No, sir, I don't believe that

that's —
QUESTION:

You concede they can recover for a

violation of the statute —

19

MR. WOODSIDE:

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WOODSIDE:

No.

-- without proving negligence?
No, but let me tell you why.

22

We don't -- I don't mean to be sarcastic, but it is our

23

position that the regulations don't govern this --

24

excuse me, that the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does

25

not govern this situation, and that since it is not our
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

drug, we couldn't be liable under any circumstances.

2

Nevertheless, there are significant federal questions

3

raised by the complaint, and it is because of the

4

questions that are raisea by the complaint that federal

5

question jurisdiction is proper.

6

Now, our position woula be, if this matter has

7

to be tried somewhere, that we are not liable, and that

8

there is no presumption of negligence, and we didn't

9

violate the statute.

Nevertheless, the situation in

10

which we presently find ourselves is, we have to aeal

11

with the allegations which are raised in the complaint,

12

ana under the well proved complaint rule there is in

13

fact —
QUESTION:

14

Why would this be any different

15

than if you had a Canadian railroad or something like

16

that, and they said you have violated the Federal Safety

17

Appliance Act, and we allege the federal statute applies

18

in Canada, and that is a federal question, and as a

19

result of that violation we are going to recover for

20

negligence?

Why is that case different?

MR. WOODSIDE:

21

It might not be, but let me go

22

back and respond to the first part of your question,

23

that first, where there would be the federal question

24

would be, is the Canadian railroad subject to the FELA

25

Act.

Now, if they are operating in the United States,
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

they might be, but this is -- we are not in an analogous

2

situation.

3

operating in Scotland.

4

there is going to be a federal question raised, and

5

the

We are not operating in Canada.

QUESTION:

6

We are not

The question is whether or not

Mr. Woodside, is your answer to

7

Justice Stevens hypothetical about the Canadian railroad

8

that there is or is not federal question jurisdiction?
MR. WOODSIDE:

9

It depends on whether the

10

railroad was operating in the United States.

11

railroad was operating in the United States -QUESTION:

12

If the

No, he says the railroad was

13

operating in Canada, and it is pleaded that the federal

14

law applies in this particular situation in Canada, as I

15

understood it.
MR. WOODSIDE:

16

If that were the situation, I

17

would say there is also a federal question created there

18

because in order for the plaintiffs in that case to

19

recover they would have to demonstrate that the FELA or

20

whatever the federal statutes would be would be

21

applicable to a Canadian railroad doing things in

22

Canada.

23

federal question.

24
25

It is that first question, which would be the

QUESTION:

In my example earlier about the

boating accident, I suppose if it was pleaded that the
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

coast guard regulation applies even though it is

2

doubtful whether these waters are navigable, if one can

3

conceive of a pleading like that, that that would make

4

it a federal question jurisdiction.

5

MR. WOODSIDE:

6

QUESTION:

7

You are turning the whole thing

just into a case by case analysis, it seems to me.
MR. WOODSIDE:

8
9

Your Honor --

Well, to some extent I am, but

the point I want to make is, it is a small number of

10

cases.

If you look at Moore, and if you look at an

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

the well established standard that there need to be
either a private cause ot action, and both sides admit
that there is no private cause of action.

As a matter

ot fact, the legislative history shows that that was one
of the options, to give a private cause of action to
FDAC, Federal Drug and Cosmetic cases, and that was
deleted by Congress.
So then the question is, is there a federal
question, and while my worthy opponent would like to
surgically excise two Bendectin cases, we cannot take
case by case, because historically there is presently
sitting a stay order on 235 American cases in which the
Honorable Judge Ruben, after the Bendectin trial, took
the 235 cases that could not be removed because they
were residents of Ohio, Merrell Dow being a resident of
Ohio, it's a 1441(b) scenario.

The court took these 235

American cases and put them back to the state court,
remanded them to the state court, and has withheld his
order pending the determination of this issue.
QUESTION:

And all those cases, have they gone

to judgment?
MR. CHESLEY:

No, Your Honor, they have not.

What happened was, they had gone to judgment in the
federal court, and after the verdict, Judge Ruben held

totally with Justice Powell that it is a negligence

case, and that you are talking about a standard of

conduct and a violation of the FDA is at best a

injured by violations of the FDCA, and that, two, the

2

plaintiff's right to relief does not depend necessarily

3

upon a finding of a violation of the FDCA, and you could

4

still find negligence, and this is consistent with the

5

rulings by all other circuits and the Supreme Court.

6

I believe circuits have already addressed,

7

most circuits have already addressed -- I know the

8

Seventh Circuit has, ana other circuits, and we indicate

9

that on Page 13 and 14 of our brief, and I don't want to

10
11

track our brief before this Court.
I believe that at best this Court would have

12

to take a position, because I don't believe that the

13

Court would ever want to take the position that all of

14

these are federal Acts -- pardon me, are federal issues

15

of law, every one of these, because that would be an

16

impossible floodgate of litigation.

17

The next question that this Court would have

18

to address is, does this Court want to take FDAC and

19

make it a private cause of action, and I do not see

20

anything in the preceding cases, whether it be franchise

21

or more, that would lead one to believe that it is the

22

intent of this Court to make the FDAC a private cause of

23

action, and of course this Court can change it, can

24

change that rule and make it a private cause of action.

25

I advocate that it should not.

I advocate

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

that the state courts, whether it be Ohio or Kentucky,

2

can clearly apply the law, and it does not take only the

3

wisdom of a federal district court to apply the law.

4

Simply stated, the FDAC is a very simple statute.

5

Misbranding is misbranding, and the best example I can

6

give you is that Ohio has an exact parallel statute on

7

misbranding which is word for word.

8
9

I would suggest or submit that not only would
it open the floodgates, as we have indicated, but it

10

would, I believe, create an impression that of course

Merrell would like.

12

any and all federal drug cases must or become dominanted

14

15

intention, because of the backlog of the federal

judiciary, is not to encumber federal trial judges with

17

more litigation, what with Title 7, Social Security

18

cases, Speedy Trial Act cases, not to encumber the

19

federal court with more cases, because I think as

20

succinctly stated on the last page of our brief, and I

21

would inaicate that I think it is very well stated by

22

Ms. Smith, who wrote that portion, on the point that you

23

would have a situation whereby every time there was an

QUESTION:

If there is no private cause of

MR. CHESLEY:

The Court always has

Yes.
-- there is a cause of action

stated.

8

QUESTION:

Yes.

9

MR. WOODSIDE:

And so the Court would have

10

jurisdiction to say, there is no private cause of

11

action, therefore the lawsuit is dismissed.

12

QUESTION:

But you say that this case should

13

not be remanded to the state court because even though

14

there is no private cause of action there was

15

jurisdiction to entertain this suit on removal.

16

MR. WOODSIDE:

Correct.

That is correct.

And

17

that is because of the substantial nature of the federal

18

question presented, which is the application of the

19

Fooa, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to a situation involving a

20

drug which is manufactured by a company other than

21

defendant, solo by a company other than defendant, in a

22

country where it was manufactured and sold by other

23

companies who themselves were subject to their own

24

regulatory scheme, and not to the regulatory scheme of

25

the United States, and the plaintiffs themselves were

foreign consumers of that product.
Therefore one of the substantial federal

3

questions is, does the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic

4

Act apply to Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals in this

5

particular situation.

6

That is a significant federal question to be determined

7

in the first instance by the Court.

That is not a factual question.

8

Thank you.
