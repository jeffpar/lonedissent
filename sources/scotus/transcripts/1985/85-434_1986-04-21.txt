passage cf the Federal Tort Claims Act?

21

MR. PINCUSi

Well, Your Honor, we — even

22

Respondents don't contend that the Tort Claims Act is an

23

implied repeal of Section 702(c), and we think that the

24

prcper result would be tc read the statutes together,

25

and that section — that the Tort Claims Act would waive

In 1960 a private bill seeking recovery

10

for flood damages was referred to the Court cf Claims

11

for an assessment by Congress, and the Court cf Claims

12

in its report back to Congress specifically noted that

13

the claimants would have no action against the United

14

States at law because Section 702(c) was a settled bar

in its previous cases that even if -- that are cited in

cf the Tort Claims Act that they never saw fit tc

We know that when you have got any statutory

3

construction, you have got to look at the plain meaning

4

of the statute.

5

that it

6

was

We have already talked alert the fact

superfluous at the

time it was enacted.

Secondly, if you say we are going to apply

7

this literal meaning rule in this case, you are going to

8

have to have an exception.

9

we will apply the literal meaning of 702(c)

You are going to have to say
except in

10

the event of constitutional takings because that would

11

render the statute unconstitutional.

12

additional reason that we have mentioned, that is, the

13

statute would have had no meaning, the Tort Claims Act

14

is what gave it life, I think we should consider tic

15

policy as announce! by Congress and the fact that there

16

were -- the government had been engaging up until the

17

time of the Tort Claims Act in many activities which

18

presented great risk, but it no time lid the government

19

see fit to codify the doctrine of sovereign immunity.

20

And then the

Now, what was significant about this statute

21

is the fact that for the first time,

the government was

22

agreeing to compensate property owners alcng the

23

Mississippi in two situations, for damages that did not

24

rise to the level of a taking;

25

section of 702(c); and 702(d) damages.

that is the previse

Now, the way that statute arose, this was the

1
2

first time that I found where the government ever agreed

3

to pay for anything other than what the Constitution

4

required in these type cf cases.

Sc Ccngress was very

5

concerned, and these statutes, the 702(c) proviso and

6

the 702(d) damages, came about as a result cf a classic

7

case of congressional compromise, if ycu will.

8

one hand, you had the very generous provision that the

9

Senate had enacted in Senate Bill 3740 where they said

10

that — it

11

pay for all sorts of property damages, and cne of the

12

things that -- in addition tc the constitutional

13

takings, and additionally, they were going to pay for

14

relocating railroads, and that Ircugbt about

15

was overly genercus.

Cn the

considerable concern in the House.

16

Now, the Senate provision was modified in the

17

Ecuse before the debate, so it came tc the fleer cf the

18

House where the actual debate took, place, with the

19

Senate’s version cn the cne hard and the administration,

20

the Ccclidge administration cn the other, which

21

basically said we want to pay fer constitutional takings

22

and net a dime mere.
So what cane about was 702(c) and 702(d), with

23
24

both sides giving seme.

that they were going tc be "fleeced" by local juries ir.

in the House that they would not — that the extra

damages over and above constitutional takings would be

24

limited to these specific situations described in tbe

25

702(c) proviso, that is, the situation where the damages
