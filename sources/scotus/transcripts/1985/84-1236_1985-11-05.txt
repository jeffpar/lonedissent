QUESTION;

Mr. White, has the Fifth Circuit

since its decision in this case ever had presented to it

10

the question of whether the state might go back and

11

12

double jeopardy of some sort?

13

MR. WHITE;

Yes, they have.

In Jones versus

Thigpen, whi :h is also on cert before this Court right

retroactively, and if there appears to them an

phase the court did mention in Enmund that it was not

dispositive, but a matter of concern that on the

8

this case, that they could consider as a mitigating

9

factor his — the fact that he was an accomplice, and

10
11

Further on the sentence

that his participation was relatively minor.
So, we have that, too,

that the jury was in

12

this pre-Enmund context told to look at his

13

participation and see if it was in fact minor, and that

14

if it was, then they rould use that as a mitigating

SB. WHITE;

I know, but the argument is that

MB. SHITE;

Sell, possibly so, but there is

12

another — our interpretation or our interpretation of

13

Enmund is that the Court left us with four options

14

there, and any one of those wculd support the death

15
16

penalty, one of those being that he attempted to kill,
I
and actually took a part in the furtherance of that, or

17

that he killed.

18

He don’t read Enmund as requiring that if

19

someone actually killed, that he had to have an intent

20

to do so in that particular context.

21

QUESTION;

Yes, but the Fifth Circuit’s

22

position, I think, was that because of the instructions

23

to the jury in the trial court, although there might

24

have been evidence that would have supported the same

25

finding that the Supreme Court of Mississippi made, the

QUESTION;

They are concerned

So I don't think, it is entirely

8

accurate to say that the Supreme Court of Mississippi

did nothing that we know for sure the jury did —

10

MR. WHITE;

Well, we contend that that finding

11

that they made that he was an active participant,

12

present, aiding, and assisting in the assault and the

that is sufficient enough finding, and

MR. WHITE;

It has bean.

Of course, this

23

case, as has been pointed out, was tried long before

24

Enmund, so that was not in their mini when they were

25

making this finding.

Since that time, on cases that

17

MR. WHITE*

18

QUESTION;

19
20

Yes, sir.
That would be helpful, because I

have a problem with it.
MR. WHITE*

Of course, in Mississippi, the

21

situation involved we will have, there are about ten

22

cases involved now.

23

ten of those cases are such that this case will impact

24

on those cases as to how this decision comes out,

25

because there were no jury findings made in these cases,

We have 40 people on death row, and

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

and the findings on Enmund were basically dene by the

2

Supreme Court are not made at all because it was not an

3

issue raised before the Supreme Court.

4

We would submit that the view taken by the

5

Eleventh Circuit is a more — approach in this

6

particular context, that the finding of an Appellate

7

Court on the record is done all the time, and the

8

decision, of course, in Ross v. Kemp is totally

9

consistent with the ruling in

10
11

this Court in Enmund

versus Florida.
The basis of proportionality, relying on the

12

facts as set forth here in Florida, throughout the Inman

13

opinion this Court makes it plain that it was deciding a

14

case based on proportionality, on a proportionality

15

review of the record, and as we said earlier, later ii

16

Solem versus Helm, the same type of reasoning was used.

17

Each criteria set forth in Solem versus Helm was

18

supported by Enmund as an example, and of course the

19

argument that due process requires in Fississippi some

20

jury finding is not persuasive, because as we possibly

21

said earlier, that Spaziano held that there was no

22

constitutional right to a jury determination of

23

sentence, and therefore Enmund requires only that the

24

death penalty cannot be imposed under the defendant's --

25

unless the defendant's individual participation

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

1

justifies it in the given case.
So, we look at these findings found by the

2
3

state, by the State Supreme Court.

We look -- the Fifth

4

Circuit totally ignored the fact that in the sentencing

5

instructions, that they were given the mitigating factor

6

that the defendant was an accomplice in the capital

7

offense, and his participation was relatively minor.

8

They even make the comment in the opinion that the state

9

after this guilt phase instruction gave no ether

10

instruction that focused the jury's attention tc his

11

culpability in this crime or his participation in this

12

crime.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEES - RESUMED

7

MR. WHITE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

8

please the Court, I think. I will attempt to answer

9

Justice Stevens' question at this time.

Having reviewed

10

the opinion of the Supreme Court and some of the factors

11

involved there, we would answer it in this way, that the

12

jury finding, of course, was a general verdict, and so

13

we did not know the precise parameters of what they

14

found there.

15

However, the Mississippi Supreme

16

findings in two specific instances in the opinion do

17

delineate with great exactitude just what they found, or

18

their interpretation of what the jury found and what

19

they see from the record, and

20

of evidentiary sufficiency on the claim of the failure

21

tc grant a directed verdict as to manslaughter, where

22

they found that Bullock was present, aiding --

The opinion in Enmu nd,

And In conclusion,

19

we would submit that the

view of determination of the Enmund factors and criteria

used by the Eleventh Circuit is much more consistent

must be made by a jury.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOSEPH T.

MC LAUGHLIN, ESQ.,

CN BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

Very well.

MR. MC LAUGHLIN;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

6

it please the Court, we seek affirmance cf the Circuit

7

Court's determination that Ccawford Bullock could not

8

lawfully be sentenced to death for capital murder where

9

the jury was not instructed to find and did not find

10

that he killed, attempted to kill, intended to kill, or

11

contemplated the use of lethal force.

12

This result, dictated by this Court's

13

decisions in Enmund, Lockett,

14

simply that the defendant may be resentenced properly

15

under the amended Mississippi death penalty statute

16

which specifically requires the jury to find that the

17

defendant's conduct satisfies one or more of the Enmund

18

factors before it may determine whether to impose the

19

death sentence.

20

Mullany, and ethers, means

Crawford Bullock's death sentence was imposed

21

and upheld by the Mississippi Supreme Court prior to

22

this Court's decision in Enmund, and it was not based on

23

his personal responsibility or his moral guilt.

24
25

There are at least four things this case is
not about, and I would like to start by exploring them

3

do urge consistency with this Court's own view expressed

4

in Ic-ckett where the Court said states have authority to

5

make aiders and abetters equally responsible as a matter

6

of law with principles or to enact felony murder

7

statutes, but the definition of a crime does not

8

automatically dictate the proper penalty.

9

First, we seek no limit on the power of the

Second, we seek no redefinition or refinement

10

of Enmund which in words of plain meaning and common

understanding prohibits, we would submit, the execution

12

of one who does not kill, attempt to kill, intend to

13

kill, or contemplate that lethal force would be used.

verdict in a criminal case, beginning now tc read ?t the

18

top of Page A-81, "All evidence most favorable to the

disregarded."

I think it is important to put in contest what

the Mississippi Supreme Court said, because on Page

13

conclusion that Hr. Bullock was an active participant in

1 1

the homicide by saying, and I quote from the middle of

the page, "The law is well settled in this state that

It is not necessarily the case that an

4

not find that Enmund was satisfied, and let me explain.

5

First, it is not necessary that the questions that the

6

Mississippi law now requires be asked in every capital

7

murder case, it is net necessary that those questions

8

precisely be asked outside the state of Mississippi.

9

If, for example, the statute under which

the

10

defendant was indicted and convicted required the jury

11

to find that the person intentionally or with malice

12

aforethought took life.

13

Enmund is satisfied because the man was charged with

14

intentional killing.

The statute takes care of it.

15

Second, it is not necessary that these

16

questions be asked, or that the jury be involved

17

specifically.

18

sole actor in the crime, and this is undisputed, because

19

there a jury verdict, even a general verdict of guilt

20

under a felony, a classic felony murder statute,

21

necessarily means that the defendant took life.

22

If, for example, the defendant was the

raised by

23

the amicus as to whether or not it is required

24

constitutionally also to find

25

intentional taking of life, but putting that question

that there was an

aside, if there is a sole actor in any of these cases in

2

the Eleventh Circuit, the Wainwright cases, et cetera,

3

are cases where the only person involved in the crime is

4

the person whom the jury convicts.
It would not be necessary in those cases to go

5

6

back and resentence and ask question which are really

7

pointless, because the jury has already made the

8

determination which satisfies Enmund if Enmund does not

9

require more than just a killing.
Third, if the defendant was convicted of

10

11

felony murder but the jury found an aggravating

12

circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt that the

13

defendant intentionally killed during the commission of

14

the predicate felony, it would not be necessary in my

view to go back and require of the questions that

standard to apply.

Judge Clark recognized in his concurring and dissenting

exceptions where the Court will develop over time, if it

6

is appropriate, some concept of harmless error, error

beyond a reasonable doubt, but I am not advocating that

8

position, and I am not suggesting it is pressented by

9

this record, because this record, if it presents

10
11

All I am saying is that I think

anything, presents a sharp dispute.
There is no question but that the evidence,

12

even as construed in a statutory or other fashion by the

13

Mississippi Supreme Court, supports the conclusion that

14

Bickie Tucker killed the deceased, and there is no

15

finding and no suggestion of any finding anywhere,

16

either by the jury or by the Mississippi Supreme Court

17

that Crawford Bullock had any intent to take the life of

18

Mark Dickson.

19

Indeed, the question here is whether the jury

20

must make one or more of the Enmund findings before an

21

individual convicted of felony murder may be sentenced

22

to death in a state where all capital sentence findings

23

must be made by the jury.

believe it is necessary to attack in any way the holding

in Spaziano.

If there are states, as there are, that

2

protect and preserve the role of the judge in the

3

sentencing process, the role we suggest, which is a

4

narrow one, does not require any other result.

5

simply requires either that the case meet one of the

6

exceptions that I outlined or that the jury make

7

findings to push that defendant across the

8

constitutional threshold where he is at least eligible

9

to be sentenced to death.

It

It does not require that he be sentenced to

10
11

death, and it does not preclude the role of the judge in

12

deciding whether to sentence that person to death.

13

Indeed, it does not preclude the judge from overruling,

14

as the judge did in the Flcrida case of Spaziano, a

15

recommendation by the jury that the defendant be

16

sentenced to life.
It simply says that you must have a finding by

the jury, at least in those states where the jury must

make all capital guilt and sentencing findings as a

The reason for that is that the

done with or without any desire to effect death, then by
consenting to the killing, by being there, by being

proximate, if you will, to the killing

done by Rickie Tucker, then Crawford Bullock could be
sentenced to death.
We submit that does not meet and cannot meet
the Enmund standard.

facts of this case that the jury thought it was enough
that sitting in a two-door automobile, which this
automobile was, Crawford Bullock opened the doer at seme
point and Rickie Tucker stepped out of the automobile
and chased the driver, ultimately the victim in this
case, Mark Tickson, before he beat him to death.

9

convicted and sentenced to death prior to the amendment

10

of the Mississippi death penalty statute requiring the

11

jury specifically to make the Enmund findings in the

12

language of Enmund, and what the court said, I think,

13

was quite instructive at 472 Southern 2nd 409.

14

The court said that the instructions given to

15

16

Enmund findings because for Gray to be found guilty and

17

sentenced to death he had to be found by the jury to

18

have unlawfully, wilfully, and feloniously, and of his

19

malice aforethought, killed and murdered.

20

court went on to define malice aforethought as a

21

predetermination to commit an act without legal

22

justification or excuse.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN L. WHITE, JR., ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - REBUTTAL

9

HR. WHITE;

Just a point or two to make some

10

clarifications.

11

Court —? in the evidence before the trial court there as

12

far as the blood and everything, the testimony was that

13

they couldn't make a determination whose blood that was

14

on the rocks, and rurther, that we did net have these

15

findings or the idea of what these findings , the

16

specific language these findings were to be made in

17

until some two years after Bullock was decided, three

18

years after it was tried.

19

The evidence in the Mississippi Supreme

So, the actual wording of the findings of the

20

Mississippi Supreme Court as the opponents contend was

21

not in the language of Enmuni

22

any bearing here.

23

an active participant and that active participation was

24

holding someone by the hair of the head while somebody

25

else beat him with a bottle or hit him with a bottle,

I don't think would have

We do have a finding that if he was

and he, of course, at that time was injured himself, and

2

so we do contend that the evidence is clear that Mr.

3

Bullock was right in the middle of all this, and is

4

certainly a candidata for the daath penalty.

5

QUESTIONS

General White, could I just ask

6

you, because I am a little confused on it, is it

7

correct, as your opponent says, that the evidence is

8

also clear that he was not killed by the bottle, but he

9

was killed by the concrete block?

10

12

13
14

MR. WHITE*

He was killed by the concrete

blocks being dropped on his heal.
QUESTION*

Which happened after the striking

with the bottle.
MR. WHITE*

Well, as a part, as a continuation

15

after Bullock was injured by the bottle hitting his hand

16

as he was hitting the man's head.

17
18

QUESTION*

Did Bullock have any part in the

act of h'.tting with the concrete block?

QUESTION*

2

Do you consider -- I am sure there

3

are very persuasive fact, and there are certainly very

4

troublesome facts, but are they relevant to the Enmund

5

issue, the post-death facts of the way they disposed of

the body?
SB. WHITE*

7

Well, traditionally, I think we

8

look at someone's intent by their actions surrounding

9

the crime.

We determine intent when we don't have — we

very seldom have the case where the guy, a criminal

But. I just want to be — you are

15

suggesting that the post-death facts tend to

death to occur.
