We will hear arguments

MR. MINEAR;

Thank ycu, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, the government defends the

10

constitutionality of Section 3(i) of the Focd Stamp Act,

11

which provides that parents and children or siblings whc

12

live together shall he treated as a single hcusehcld

13

food stamp entitlement purposes.

This case is here cn the government's direct

15

appeal from the United States District Court fcr the

16

Southern District of Texas.

19

burdening family decisions tc live together.

The District Court ruled

3(i) violates ecual prctecticn principles

After briefly describing the food

stamp

21

program and the facts of this case, I will explain why

22

the District Court's decision should be reversed.

23

The Food Stamp Act establishes a social

24

welfare program funded by the Department of Agriculture

25

and administered by state agencies.

It supplements the

1

food purchasing power cf low income households.

Under

2

this program state agencies distribute focd stamps tc

3

needy households on the basis cf standard allotments

4

that take into account household size.
The food stamp program has grown rapidly since

5

6

its creation in 1964.

It is new the nation’s second

7

most costly needs-based public assistance program.

8

1983, program outlays were over $11 billion, providing

9

assistance to «ever 21 million program participants.

In

The huge cost and dramatic growth cf the feed

10
11

stamp program have produced

public concern ever reports

12

of widespread waste and fraud.

13

1982 Congress amended the Focd Stamp Act to improve

14

program efficiency and to curtail certain types of

15

frequently encountered recipient abuse.

In 1981 and again in

Congress gave particular attention tc the Feed

16
17

Stamp Act’s definition of the term "household."

18

tc 1981, persons who lived together tut purchased and

19

prepared their meals separately could claim separate

20

household status, and thereby receive higher per capita

21

benefits.

As a result families frequently

Congress in response amended the household

household for food stamp entitlement purposes regardless

3

cf their actual meal purchase and preparation habits.

Congress also provided a special exception,

elderly and disabled parents and siblings tc qualify as

a separate household if they in fact did separately

prepare their meals.

These amendments tc the household definition
were specifically designed tc assure the nation’s

12

Appellee Natividad Castillo and his family

13

challenged the constitutionality cf the revised

14

household definition.

15

definition violated equal protection principles by

16

denying certain family members the opportunity tc claim

17

separate household status.

18

consolidated their action with three other suits raising

19

similar equal protection claims.

20

They claimed that the new

The District Court

The District Court ultimately held that the

21

household definition is unconstitutional, arc enjelred

22

its application against the appellees.

23

acknowledged that Section 3(i)*s treatment cf family

24

members had a rational basis, therefore it meets the

25

generally applicable equal protection requirements.

The court

The

1

ccurt concluded, however, that family-based

2

classifications are subject

to heightened scrutiny.

It then held without further analysis that

Section 3(i) violated the appellees* Fifth

rights .

6

QUESTION:

Amendment

Is there anything in the record,

7

Mr. Minear, which shows the difference in cost between

8

the two programs?

9

MR. MINEAR:

It is not clear from the record,

10

but it is clear from the regulations themselves, and the

11

regulations provide, for instance, that an eight-member

12

household would receive 75 percent of the benefits that

13

would be given to eight separate households, and

that

14

two four-member households receive 110 percent of the

15

benefits of the eight-member household.

16

Me submit that the Disrict Ccurt erred in

17

concluding that Section 3(i) violates equal protection

18

principles.

19

definition represents a rational legislative intent to

20

improve the efficiency of the food stamp program by

21

adopting standards that as a general matter direct the

22

nation’s limited welfare resources to those : with the

23

greatest need.

24
25

Instead, Section 3(i)*s household

We note first, as the District Court agreed,
that Section 3(i)*s household definition meets the

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

rational basis test.

Congress enacted the revised

2

household definition in response to serious public

3

concern ever the size, effectiveness, and integrity cf

4

the food stamp program.

5

hearings revealed that from

6

stamp benefits were issued in error, amounting to a

7

program loss cf from $1 to $2 billion per year.

The 1981 and 1982 Congressional
11 to 20 percent cf feed
/

8
9

These hearings also revealed that the practice
cf family members falsely claiming separate household

10

status was one of the most serious forms of abuse.

11

Finally, the hearings revealed that in light of the

12

large number cf families that participate in the fccc

13

stamp program, there is no effective and efficient means

14

for verifying family household status.

15

Congress therefore elected to redefine the

16

term "household" as a workable solution to this sericus

17

and costly problem.

18

the rational Congressional judgment based on thorough

19

investigation and deliberation that food stamp abuses

20

can be reduced and benefits preserved for those most in

21

need by treating family members who live together as a

22

single household.

23

The refined definition represents

Furthermore, this definition is carefully

24

tailored to provide special relief for elderly and

25

disabled parents and siblings, these family members that

1

Congress determined were most in need cf special

2

treatment.

3

In short, Section 3(i)’s revised "household"

4

definition represents the type cf reascnatle

5

classification that is routinely employed in social

6

welfare programs.

7

withstands rational basis scrutiny, the type cf scrutiny

8

this Court applies to these types of classifications.

9

The revised definition plainly

Indeed, the District Court as well as all

10

other courts that considered this issue agree that the

11

"household" definition meets the rational basis test.

12

The District Court went astray in applying

13

heightened scrutiny to the Food Stamp Act’s "household"

14

definition because plainly family members, the class

15

affected by the "household definition," do net represent

16

a suspect or quasi-suspect class.

17

"household" definition does not result in any

18

constitutionally significant limitation on individual

19

choice in family matters.

20

Furthermore, the

Heightened scrutiny has been applied to laws

21

affecting family-based decision only when the

22

government’s action directly and substantially

23

interferes with important family choices.

24

household definition dees net prevent any group cf

25

persons, related or unrelated, from living together, and

QUESTIONS

15

As far as they were designed tc

prevent fraud, is it rational to assume that families

17

are more likely to defraud the government than unrelated

18

individuals?
MR. MINEAR;

19

I think it is clear that families

20

are better situation in fact tc falsely claim separate

21

household status, and it also seems that family members

22

are more likely to purchase and prepare their meals

together.

Do you think the statute would be

constitutional if it established a presumption that the

related families did purchase and prepare feed together,

8

but that unrelated families did not, and then there

would be a burden on the particular family tc shew that

presumption?

CN EEHALF CF THE AEPEIIANT - REEUTTAL

2

MR. MINEAR:

Just a few minutes, Mr. Chief

3

Justice, and may it please the Ccurt.

The regrettable

4

problem here is, the government’s resources for welfare

5

are limited, and in order to provide maximum use cf

6

those limited resources, certain broad categories and

7

general characteristics must be used in order to

8

distribute these social welfare benefits, and it simply

9

is not effective to expend those limited resources cn

10

case by case determinations when in fact these resources

11

can be directed to the persons themselves who need

12

them.

13

QUESTION*

What about the unrelated families?

14

You:would be saving a lot of money if you didn’t do

15

these case by case.

16

MR. MINEARs

That might be right,

Your Honor.

17

However, those are a much smaller portion cf the total

18

number of food stamp recipients in the program.

19

Therefore what Congress in fact is doing is directing

20

its limited resources to those areas where there is the

21

greatest possible need for special exceptions, and that

22

was in fact Congress's thinking, in fact, preserving

23

this separate household status for unrelated persons and

the elderly and the disabled .
