HR. HC NALLY ;

Hr.

Hr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
/

This is a direct appeal taken from an original

probate action in west Texas.

The Appellant was denied

10

inheritance rights from her father on the basis that she

11

was an illegitimate child.

12

presented;

13

in Trimble v. ’Gordon is binding authority where the

14

father died before Trimble was decided and suit was

15

filed afterwards in his open estate; second, whether any

16

sufficient state interest supports enforcement of the

17

naked status of bastardy after the father's death; and

18

third, whether the preference of surviving fathers over

19

surviving mothers is substantially related to any

20

sufficient state interest.

MR. MC NALLY;

No, Ycur Honor.

She was

excluded from Chapter 13 in at least two ways during the

Chapter 13 gave no relief at all to a child born before

But the effect is ycu've had an

Under that provision as construed by the

Also, the Family Cede gave the right tc

Under this test, Trimble is not binding act hcrity if the

MR. MC NALLYs

22

illegitimacy, and since the state has taken that step,

1

insurmountable barrier, and the analysis that Trimble

2

should be applied.
This Court has used, in recent times, since

3
4

1965, discussed retroactivity in two contexts.

The

5

civil retroactivity has been governed by Chevron v.

6

Huson, and I

7

the purpose of Trimble is germane.

would like to point out that under Chevron
The second of the

t

8

Chevron elements is whether the purpose of Trimble v.

9

Gordon would be served or hindered by being applied in

10

an open estate.

Trimble has two purposes.

11

purpose is the fairness interest, the fairness -- the

12

interest of the child and of the state itself to

13

recognizing fair claims, and the other interest is

14

preserving security of title to land and orderly

15

probate.
Here we have an open state.

16

The first

We are going --

17

the only way to recognize the fairness interest is to

18

allow inheritance, and that

19

because the estate is open, without jeopardizing orderly

20

probate and without jeopardizing security of title to

21

land .

can be dene in this case

22

The most recent analysis that this Court has

23

applied in the Fourth and Fifth Amendment context also
%

24

locks carefully to whether the estate is epen or close,

25

and the Court has said in U.S. v. Johnson that a new

unless it works a sharp break with the past, in cases

4

This case is pending cn direct appeal, and it

5

doesn't work any sharp break with the past.

6

Insurmountable barrier analysis was not created in

Trimble.

8

Trimble did net apply any new analysis.

9

v. Johnson, Trimble should also be given retroactive

It was there long before Trimble sc that

Under the U.S.

application in an open estate.

11

The dissent in U.S. v. Johnson was very

12

concerned about whether the purpose of the exclusionary

13

rule was served by retroactive application.

14

concern was net present in this case because the purpose

15

of Trimble is served, both purposes of Trimble are

16

served by application in this estate and are defeated

ground tc Trimble v. Gordon's retroactivity?

Exactly.

In effect, the

analysis of the lower court is that we just don’t lock

at equal protection if Trimble is retroactive.

no retroactivity question because it hasn’t teen decided

doesn’t that — confining it tc that second question,

12

what is your -- your theory is that this cutoff da.te cf

Yes.

So is it a statute of limitations

MR. MC NALLY;

Well, there is the statute

limitations, although it is not really statute of

QUESTION;

2

3

But may I just finish cue thought

on that question?

4

I thought the answer of the lower court in

part was that even under the statute, if the date had

net been there, your client would not have qualified

7

under the facts of this case.
/

Didn’t they so — that the father hadn *t

Am I wrong in that?

MR. MC NALLY;

Your Honor, in effect that was

the alternative ruling that — and they were looking,

15

they were saying, well, if ycu apply the 1979 statute,

Your Honor, the Winn action, which recognized

the invalidity of the date of birth prevision, has never

been applied in Texas to recognize anything other than

the right of child support.

it has never given the equivalent relief available under

the Family Cede action, it has never given legitimation,

It was net the equivalent,

Was that the --

QUESTION;

Sc when was the first time,

2

MR. MC NALLY;

*78?

Your Honor, I would think that

3

the first time that Texas allowed it would le in

1977

4

because the voluntary legitimation for support purposes

5

was enacted right after Gomez in

*73.

Technically if the father had agreed and gene

6
7

in and sworn that that was his child in *73, and then

8

died after, right after 1977, that would have been the

9

earliest.

that hadn't happened, there

MR. MC NALLY;

Other than that, the first

1979, there was no way that
QUESTION;

that would help you.

Mr. McNally, was this estate in

probate at the time Trimble was decided?
MR. MC NALLY;

Your Honor, yes, the estate had

20

already teen filed.

It was pending on file from January

21

of 1977, so it had been on file for some months.

22

Celynda's claim for inheritance was not filed until

23

after Trimble, but there was an applicati on*cn file

24

stating that the other heirs were the heirs of the

25

estatekwhen Trimble came down.
