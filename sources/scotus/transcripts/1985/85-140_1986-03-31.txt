CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

The Court will hear argumen

first this morning in Bowers against Hardwick.

4

Mr. Hobbs, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. HOBBS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

MR. HOBBS:

8

12

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10
11

Thank you.

This case presents the question of whether or
not there is a fundamental right under the Constitution
of the United States to engage in consensual private

13

homosexual sodomy.
14

In 1982, Michael Hardwick was arrested and charged
15
16

with the violation of Georgia's anti-sodomy statute for

17

engaging in this conduct with a consenting adult in his

18

home.

19

20
21

The case was never presented to the grand jury
of Fulton County and no prosecution of Mr. Hardwick
ensued.

22

However, in 1983, Mr. Hardwick, along with John
23

and Mary Doe, filed a Section 1983 suit seeking injunctive
24
25

relief and declaratory relief against the enforcement of

Georgia's sodomy statute.
QUESTION:

Was there a reason, Mr. Hobbs, that

it wasn't presented to the grand jury?
MR. HOBBS:

Your Honor, the Disttict Attorney

of Fulton County, who would have handled that case —

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. HOBBS:

That is Atlanta, isn't it?
That is correct, Your Honor.

8

— indicated that it would not be presented the grand jury

9

under further evidence developed.

10

that I know that it was not presented.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HOBBS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HOBBS:

15

enforced in Georgia.

16
17
18

That is the only reason

Mr. Hobbs?
Yes, Your Honor.
Is the statute enforced in Georgia?

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor, the statute is

How many prosecutions have there been

in the last year or five years?
MR. HOBBS:

I could not tell the Court that.

19

I can only say that in our experience the statute is most

20

frequently enforced in situations where the conduct takes

21

place in more public or quasi-public areas.

22

QUESTION:

Well, I should have framed my question

23

more specifically.

24

in this case where the activity took place in a private

25

residence, has it ever been enforced?

In the context of the issue presented

4

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. HOBBS:

It had been enforced.

I believe

2

that last case I can recall was back in the 1930's or 40' s

3

in the State of Georgia.

4

Appellate decisions.

Obviously, Your Honor, the Fourth Amendment impedes

5

the ability of the State of Georgia to enforce the statute

6

when the conduct takes place in the privacy of the home.

7

Nevertheless, it is our position that the Fourth

8

Amendment restrictions should not have any bearing on

9

whether or not there is a fundamental right to engage in

10

this conduct.

11

QUESTION:

Did you say the last prosecution was

12

in the 30's or 40's?

13

MR. HOBBS:

14

concerning this type of conduct in a private setting.

The last reported Appellate decision

QUESTION:

Has it ever been enforced in a marital

situation?
MR. HOBBS:

Not to my knowledge.

Not in the

State of Georgia at least.
QUESTION:

But, on its face, the statute would

permit such a prosecution, would it not?
MR. HOBBS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

The

statute does not differentiate between married individuals,
unmarried heterosexuals or homosexuals.
It is our position that there is no fundamental
right to engage in this conduct and that the State of
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Georgia should not be required to show a compelling state

2

interest to prohibit this conduct.

3

There is certainly textual support for this

4

proposition.

5

Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the Respondent, it

6

is suggested that there is no precedential support in the

7

decision of this Court for the proposition that there is

8

a fundamental right to engage in sexual relationships

9

outside of the bonds of marriage.

And, contrary to the views expressed by the

10

This Court in the Carey decision in 1976 made

11

it fairly explicit that its previous decisions relating

12

to contraception and abortion were restricted to state

13

regulations which burden an individual's choice to prevent

14

conception or to terminate pregnancy.

15

concluded that it was not holding a state must show a

16

compelling state interest every time sexual freedom is

17

involved.

18

And, the Court

In Moore versus City of East Cleveland, Justice

19

Powell noted the difficulty this Court has sometimes had

20

in defining fundamental rights under the Due Process Clause

21

of the Fourteenth Amendment and suggested, based upon

22

numerous cases of this Court, that appropriate limits and

23

guidelines for determining whether or not rights are

24

tru«Ly fundamental can be found in the tradition, history,

25

and heritage of this nation.
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

In that particular case, Justice Powell, writing

2

for the plurality, concluded that the Constitution protects

3

the family simply because the family is so rooted in the

4

history and traditions of our nation.

5

Many of this Court's decisions have followed

6

the history and traditions of our nation in making its

7

determination as to whether or not a particular activity

8

is entitled to constitutional protection as a fundamental

9

right.

10

Thus far this Court has concluded that the right

11

of privacy includes matters which involve marriage and

12

family, procreation, abortion, child rearing and child

13

education.

14

to the Court that there is no constitutional warrant to

15

conclude that there should be a fundamental right to engage

16

in homosexual sodomy or any other type of extra-marital

17

sexual relationships.

It has never concluded, and I would suggest

18

The common thread of this Court's —

19

QUESTION:

20

Let me just ask, what is your position

on the application of the statute to a married couple?

21

MR. HOBBS:

22

QUESTION:

23
24
25

If Your Honor please —
Could it be constitutionally applied

or not?
MR. HOBBS:

I believe in light of Griswold versus

Connecticut that application of the statute to a married

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

couple would make it very problematic for the State of

2

Georgia to —
QUESTION:

3

Do you think they could or could not?

4

Do you think it would be constitutional or unconstitutional

5

to apply it to a married couple?
MR. HOBBS:

6
7

I believe that it would be

unconstitutional.

8

QUESTION:

You think it would be constitutional?

9

MR. HOBBS:
QUESTION:

10

Yes, sir.
And, what is the right that would

11

be protected of the married person in that situation in

12

your view?

13
14
15

MR. HOBBS:

The right of marital privacy as

identified by the Court in Griswold.
QUESTION:

And, this conduct, though it is

16

traditionally frowned upon as I understand your brief,

17

you would nevertheless be constitutionally protected in

18

the marital setting?

19

MR. HOBBS:

Yes, Your Honor, based upon this

20

Court's findings in Griswold versus Connecticut in which

21

Justice Douglas stated the right of marital intimacy is

22

older than our Bill of Right.

23

heritage of —

24
25

QUESTION:

It harkens back to the

He didn't say anything about this

kind of conduct.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. HOBBS:

2

The Court has previously described fundamental

That is correct, Your Honor.

3

rights, whether they be under the general heading of a

4

right of privacy or other fundamental rights, is those

5

which are so rooted in the conscience of our people as

6

to be truly fundamental.

7

Principles of liberty and justice which lie at

8

the base of our civil and political institutions, privileges

9

which have long been recognized, a common law as essential

10
11

to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.
The simple fact is that homosexual sodomy, which

12

is what is involved in this case, has never in our heritage

13

held a place —

14
15
16

QUESTION:

Is the record clear as to whether

the conduct was with a male or a female?
MR. HOBBS:

The record, I believe, Your Honor —

17

The complaint indicated that Mr. Hardwick was arrested

18

for engaging in sodomitic act with another male.

19

QUESTION:

Of course, this isn't a review of

20

any conviction, is it?

21

to show that is to show there was a danger of prosecution.

22

MR. HOBBS:

The only reason you would want

That is correct, Your Honor.

23

This is a review of a dismissal of a SectionI 1983 lawsuit

24

and under that dismissal we are bound by the allegations

25

contained in the complaint.
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Our legal history and our social traditions have

2

condemned this conduct uniformly for hundreds and hundreds

3

of years.

4

As late as 1979 in the Palm versus Hughes case

5

this Court indicated that it is neither illogical nor unjust

6

for society to express its condemnation of irresponsible

7

liaisons outside of the bonds of marriage.

8
9
10

I would submit to the Court that the Respondent
and the Eleventh Circuit have posed no reason to
distinguish the rationale of that decision.

11

Nor should the conduct be considered fundamental

12

protected by the Constitution merely because it might take

13

place in the home.

14

rely heavily upon this decision in Payton versus New York

15

and in Stanley versus Georgia.

16

Fourth Amendment case involving the physical intrusion

17

of individuals of the state into a person's home.

18

The Eleventh Circuit and the Respondents

Of course, Payton was a

This is not a Fourth Amendment case.

The Fourth

19

Amendment does not — while it does provide a general right

20

of privacy concerning the home, it does not prevent the

21

state from enacting regulations which govern activities

22

in the home.

23

QUESTION:

It might well, as a practical matter,

24

I suppose, prevent the state from enforcing its law with

25

respect to — Your point is that doesn't make the law
10

1

invalid.
MR. HOBBS:

2
3

That is absolutely correct, Your

Honor.

4

The Four Amendment, as this Court has held, protect^

5

two types of expectations, searches and seizures, and those

6

expectations are not involved in the questions presented

7

to the Court today.

8
9

Stanley versus Georgia, which is relied on most
heavily by the Respondent, is also, I would submit,

10

inapplicable to this situation, for in Stanley this Court

11

found that there was an underlying right, a fundamental

12

right under the First Amendment, to freedom to receive

13

information and ideas and it was that right which was being

14

infringed upon when Georgia attempted to prosecute Mr.

15

Stanley for the private possession of phornographic

16

materials.

17
18
19

This case does not involve any such underlying
right.
In order for Stanley to be applicable, I would

20

submit to the Court, this Court must find first that there

21

is a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy.

22

Moreover, Stanley has been limited to its facts

23

by this Court and United States versus 12 200-Foot Reels

24

of Film, wherein this Court decided that Stanley was a

25

line of demarcation, that the Court would go thus far but
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

not beyond and limited Stanley strictly to the facts of

2

that particular case.

3

Concededly there are certain kinds of highly

4

personal relationships which are entitled to heightened

5

sanctuary from the state and intrusion.

6

The Respondents would urge, and the Eleventh

7

Circuit has concluded, that the relationship involved in

8

this case is entitled to constitutional protection as a

9

fundamental right under the right of intimate association.

10

Only a limited number of associations and relationships

11

have been found by this Court to be entitled to con­

12

stitutional protection, those that attend marriage, the

13

family, raising children, and cohabitation with one's

14

relatives.

15

This Court has described those relationships

16

as personal bonds which have played a critical role in

17

the culture and traditions of the nation by cultivating

18

and transmitting shared ideals and beliefs.

19

QUESTION:

Mr. Hobbs, when you say "cohabitation

20

with one's relatives," you mean living in the same house

21

with them?

22

MR. HOBBS:

23

(Laughter)

24

MR. HOBBS:

25

That is correct, Your Honor.

I was referring, of course, to this

Court's decision in Moore versus East Cleveland.
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

This description, I would submit to the Court,

1

2

does not apply to the conduct which is prescribed by

3

Georgia's sodomy statute.

4

Respondent and some amici in this case have

5

argued that perhaps the definition of the family should

6

be changed so as to be extended to homosexuals and other

7

types of relationships which have not been recognized in

8

our society thus far so as to accommodate the conduct

9

which is prohibited and elevated to a constitutional status.

10

QUESTION:

General Hobbs, can I ask you one

11

question that is prompted by Justice Rehnquist's notion

12

that there are difficulties of enforcement within the home

13

and earlier you had been asked about the extent to which

14

the statute has been enforced.
In this case, as I read the complaint, the

15
16

Plaintiff expressly alleged that he did this sort of thing

17

over and over again.

18

discovery to find out maybe they could prove that that

19

was, in fact, true and, therefore, could have prosecuted

20

him.

21

And, I take it the state didn't take

How do you reconcile that with the notion that

22

there is a statute that the state seeks to enforce in a

23

situation which he says exists in this case?

24
25

MR. HOBBS:

Well, Your Honor, to be quite frank,

I do not know what was in the mind of the District Attorney
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

2
3

when he decided not to prosecute this case.
QUESTION:

But, what about the state representa­

tive to defended this very lawsuit? •

4

MR. HOBBS:

5

QUESTION:

In terms of prosecuting Mr. Hardwick?
If they thought there was an important

6

public interest in enforcing the statute, why wouldn't

7

they take his discovery, get him to admit he committed

8

all these acts and then prosecute him?

9

MR. HOBBS:

Because at the time, Your Honor,

10

we relied heavily, almost exclusively on this Court's decisior

11

in Doe versus Commonwealth's Attorney.

12

was in this case by virtue of the declaratory judgment

13

action and it was decided that a motion to dismiss the

14

1983 lawsuit should be found based upon this Court's decision

15

in Doe versus Commonwealth's Attorney.

16

QUESTION:

The State of Georgia

I can understand why that would win

17

the lawsuit for you, but I find it puzzling as to how that

18

vindicates the public interest that this statute was supposed

19

to serve to stop this kind of conduct.

20
21

22
23
24
25

MR. HOBBS:
QUESTION:

Well, I think —
Does the state really have an interest

in stopping this kind of conduct?

If not, why wouldn't

they enforce the statute?
MR. HOBBS:

I think that most certainly the state

does have an interest in enforcing the statute and in
14

(202) 628-9300

maintaining the statute on our books.
As I have indicated, the Fourth Amendment makes

2
3

the enforcement of this statute very difficult, but the

4

statute also —

5

6

QUESTION:

It would have been very easy in this

case, in this instance.

7

MR. HOBBS:

8

QUESTION:

9

Perhaps so.
Presented with a silver platter and

they declined to go forward.

It seems to me there is some

10

tension between the obvious ability to convict this

11

gentleman and the supposed interest in general enforcement.

12

MR. HOBBS:

I would agree, Your Honor.

We are,

13

however, bound by the record as it is presented to the

14

Court and I am wary of going beyond the record to explain

15

other evidence.

16

The Respondent, as I was saying, and some amici

17

have urged that the relationship of the family should be

18

redefined and this is one of the interests that the State

19

of Georgia is most concerned about.

20

that there is a potential, should the Eleventh Circuit's

21

decision be upheld, for a reshuffling of our society, for

22

a reordering of our society.

23

We are very concerned

As this Court indicated in Roe versus Wade, the

24

right of privacy is not limited.

me.

It is not absolute, pardon

There must be limits and it is submitted that in finding
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

these limits we must be wary of creating a regime in the

2

name of a constitutional right which is little more than

3

one of self-gratification and indulgence.

4

The Constitution must remain a charter of

5

tolerance for individual liberty.

6

that.

7

in the social order.

But, it must not become an instrument for a change

The Respondents have made a crack-in-the-door

8
9

We have no quarrel with

argument that if the Eleventh Circuit's decision is affirmed

10

in this case it will not go beyond consensual private

11

homosexual sodomy; that it is submitted that this crack-in-

12

the-door argument is truly a Pandora's box for I believe

13

that if the Eleventh Circuit's decision is affirmed that

14

this Court will quite soon be confronted with questions

15

concerning the legitimacy of statutes which prohibit

16

polygamy, homosexual, same-sex marriage, consensual incest,

17

prostitution, fornication, adultery, and possibly even

18

personal possession in private of illegal drugs.

19

Moral issues and social issues, it is submitted

20

to the Court, should be decided by the people of this

21

nation.

22

23

representatives of those people.

24

25

concerning these issues, it is submitted, would be

interrupted and misshapen.

2

It is the right of the nation and of the states

3

to maintain a decent society, representing the collective

4

moral aspirations of the people.
The Eleventh Circuit and Respondents in this

5

6

case, by failing to adhere to the traditions, the history

7

of this nation and the collective conscience of our people,

8

would remove from this area of legitimate state concern,

9

a most important function of government and possibily make

10

each individual a law unto himself.

11

It is submitted to this Court that this is not

12

the balance that our forefathers intended between

13

individual liberties and legitimate state legislative

14

prerogatives.

15

Thank you very much, Your Honor.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

17

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE TRIBE, ESQ.

18

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

19

20

Mr. Tribe?

MR. TRIBE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

21

This case is about the limits of governmental

22

power.

23

arrest Michael Hardwick in the bedroom of his own home

24

is not a power to preserve public decorum.

25

power to protect children in public or in private.

The power that the State of Georgia invoked to

It is not a

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

It

1

is not a power to control commerce or to outlaw the

2

infliction of physical harm or "to forbid a breach in a

3

state sanctioned relationship such as marriage or, indeed,

4

to regulate the term of a state sanctioned relationship

5

through laws against polygamy or bigamy or incest.

6

The power invoked here, and I think we must be

7

clear about it, is the power to dictate in the most initimate

8

and, indeed, I must say, embarrassing detail how every

9

adult, married or unmarried, in every bedroom in Georgia

10

will behave in the closest and most intimate personal

11

association with another adult.

12

QUESTION:

Professor Tribe, is there a limiting

13

principle to your argument?

14

think responded, to the suggestion that how do you draw

15

the line between bigamy involving private homes or incest

16

or prostitution and you move on to the place.

17

MR. TRIBE:

18

QUESTION:

You commented, but I don't

Yes.
You emphasize the home and so would

19

I if I were arguing this case, but what about — Take an

20

easier one, a motel room or the back of an automobile or

21

MR. TRIBE:

The place where the acts occur.

2

In Stanley versus Georgia, this Court suggested that the

3

mere possession and enjoyment of obscenity at home is quite

4

different from other supposedly private places.

5

And, in the Fourth Amendment area, the Court

6

has faced the problem of defining what is a home.

7

for example, a mobile home may not qualify.

wherever that line is drawn that a private home such as

this represents the repository of constitutional traditions

We think that

What about incest in the private

home?

13

MR. TRIBE:

It seems to us that the private home

14

does not shield anything that one might do there.

15

to us that the state's power to regulate the terms of

16

relationships, just as it regulates the terms of contracts,

17

includes the power to punish a breach of contract in a

18

home, it can certainly punish adultery, wherever it occurs,

19

So, the limiting principle is limited

Is that a principle?

25

demonstrably physically harmful that are consensual and

Indeed, Mr. Hobbs said that under his theory

4

justification, to punish — his words were "irresponsible

liaison" outside the bonds of marriage.

couples may hold hands and they may perhaps embrace

lightly, but extended caresses or kissing with the mouth

is forbidden.

So, imagine for

Now, in their theory, even if this occurs in

11

the home, under their theory as long as the state says

12

the majority of our legislators disapprove of this conduct

13

and, indeed,' there is a long history of disapproving things

14

that might lead to greater intimacies among unmarried people,

15

we can outlaw it, not just outlaw it, but we can resist

16

a request for more particularized explanation of why.

17

When Justice Stevens asked, what is the public

18

interest after all, why is it to so great, you don't even

19

want to prosecute him in this clear case of violation,

20

I think you will notice that Mr. Hobbs retreated to

21

generalities.

22

What we suggest is that when the state asserts

23

the power to dictate the details of intimacies in what

24

they call irresponsible liaison, even in the privacy of

25

the home, that it has a burden to justify its law through

some form of tightened scrutiny.
In your concurring opinion, Justice Powell, in

3

Kelly versus Johnson when you suggested that a regulation

4

on the length of hair if applied across the board to all

5

citizens, unlike that case which was just the police, would

6

involve an important personal liberty interest, would

7

require a balancing of state interest against personal

8

interest, and cited the Harlan dissent in Poe v. Ullman,

9

I think what you recognized in that case and what I would

10

stress here is that when a state's assertion of power over

11

liberty occurs at the intersection of intimate personal

12

association, which this Court has recognized in a half-century

13

of cases, and the privacy of the home in the clearest

14

possible sense, then there must be at least heightened

15

scrutiny rather than the unquestioning deference that the

16

State of Georgia would request.

QUESTION:

I am not sure that you have answered Justic

Powell's question about incest in the privacy of the home?
MR. TRIBE:

Yes.

Mr. Chief Justice, as to incest,

20

it seems to me quite apart from problems about offspring

21

and whatever genetic evidence there might be.

22

state's power to define the terms of relationships and

23

to limit potential exploitation surely includes the power

24

in the employee/employer context to say that a parent

25

consents to sex is not real.

QUESTION:

Those are two consenting adults then perhaps.
MR. TRIBE:

I doubt, Mr. Chief Justice, that

5

the state would have to assume that just because a woman

6

is over 21, that if her father induces her to have sex,

7

that that has got to be consensual.

8
9

We think a state can assume that there are certain
relationships in the context of which, even if both people

10

are adults, in the context of which consent, because of

11

the power structure of the relationship, may just be an

12

illusion, but there is nothing about this law that limits

13

it to cases where consent is questionable or where there

14

is some other relationship between the parties that makes

15

this other than completely consensual intimacy.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, your line of reasoning

would make the Edmonds Act unconstitutional, would it not?

MR. TRIBE:

QUESTION:

The Edmonds Act —
The Edmonds Act forbade the — the

20

Moral Act forbade polygamy and the Edmonds Act forbade

21

cohabitation by one who is already married.

22

MR. TRIBE:

No, I think, Justice Rehnquist, that

23

cohabitation by one already married could be punished by

24

the state as a breach of a state sanctioned relationship.

25

If the state can punish inducement of breach of contract
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

in other cases, if the state can say that when people have

2

made a solemn bond, a bond of status as well as contract,

3

that it cannot be broken, I would think that laws against

4

cohabitation and bigamy, wherever practiced, at least raise

5

a different and far more difficult question than that here,

6

because here the state is not saying that Mr. Hardwick

7

was violating some relationship.

8

said nothing about the relationship between Mr. Hardwick

9

and the other person, male or female.

The complaint, indeed,

It just says that

10

because the majority of us disapprove morally, we have

11

the power, we, the State of Georgia, have the power to

12

punish it and make it a crime.

13

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tribe, how do you propose

14

that these other situations be analyzed, by some sort of

15

heightened scrutiny as well, and are you suggesting that

16

there is a more compelling state interest or what is it

17

you are saying?

18

MR. TRIBE:

I think, Justice O'Connor, there

19

are two approaches, either of which would lead to the same

20

result.

21

One is that the recognized power of the state

22

to protect children and to protect relationships and to

23

prevent harmful conduct is such that it would be pointless

24

to require heightened scrutiny any more than this Court

25

does of the minimum wage laws or other laws regulating

special relationships, therefore, minimum rationality would

2

suffice.

3

The other approach would be to say that if it

4

is in the privacy of the home, scrutiny should be somewhat

5

heightened, but it seems to me that it would be very easy

6

for the state to show compelling justification and a

7

compelling interest.

It seems to me that in either event the holding
of the Eleventh Circuit, which is that in cases of this

of the lines that a legislature might draw to deal with

these problems —

Professor Tribe, let's come back to

For Fourth Amendment purposes, hotel room overnight gets

3

But, when this Court decided in Payton that one

4

needs a warrant to enter a private home even with probable

cause, it is not clear to me that that decision which

6

reflected, as your concurring opinion in Rakas did, the

7

sense that there is something special about a home, would

8

automatically extend to a hotel room.

9

QUESTION:

I mentioned something special about

10

a home in Moore also against East Cleveland.

11

Poe against Ullman, but doesn't Justice Harlan in his

12

dissenting opinion exclude sodomy when he was talking about

13

the history of relationships?

14

MR. TRIBE:

You mentioned

Justice Powell, I have been troubled

15

by parts of the Harlan dissent in Moore which rather

16

casually mentioned homosexuality, and for that matter

17

abortion, in much the same breath.

18

The actual language that I think is operative

at page 552 of the Harlan dissent is that he would not

suggest — He says that "adultery, homosexuality, fornica­

We are not arguing for absolute immunity.

are arguing for heightened scrutiny.

under your view for the state to prohibit conduct between —

heterosexual conduct between males and females who are

in order to discourage that kind of conduct and sort of

foster the marriage institution?

MR. TRIBE:

I would think, Justice Stevens, first,

that if they did that, strict or substantially heightened

scrutiny would be required.

argument that it is necessary to illegalize extra-marital,

One could argue that the reason for

If that argument were made on remand,

is appropriate, it would certainly be a legitimate argument

14

for the state to advance, unlike the tautology it advances

here, we outlaw it because we don't like it, we think it

is immoral.

along the line of Boddie v. Connecticut, the right not

intimate and private a realm was really a rationally,

23

reasonably tailored means of achieving that end and I

unquestioned deference that it seeks in a case of this

triumph.

5

If history alone were the guide — Surely, I

have to conceded that the framers of the Fourteenth

have been prepared to assume that the kinds of sexual

intimacies involved in this case would be outlawed.

But,

then the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment assumed that

Virginia, where also a majority of the people of Virginia

believed that interracial liaisons were inherently immoral

and where for a long time a lot of people had believed

20

that, this Court did not think that the Constitution's

21

mission was to freeze that historical vision into place.

22

Justice Harlan's dissenting opinion in Poe v.

definition of those intimacies that are protected.

Mr. Tribe, if this evolution is taking

place, as. you suggest, and you may well be right, why isn't

it more proper for this Court to let it be reflected in

Indeed, in Justice Powell's dissent in Garcia,

16

the suggestion was made that surely this Court would never

to possibly persuade a legislature to protect them is enough.

19

In Stanley v. Georgia, another case where Georgia

20

wanted to impose its morality on the privacy of the home,

21

the argument could have also been made most states have

legalized private possession of pornography.

That is correct.

We don't rely on

peculiarities of the facts here, but we do say that it

confluence of rights represented by the home and intimacy

9

are involved.

12

14

QUESTION:

Well, then it is really not a facial

attack on the statute I don't think.
MR. TRIBE:

If you want to call it something

else, that is not a problem.
In any event, it is important, I think, to

15

recognize that he is not identifying something about his

16

situation relevantly different from that of a married couple

17

that might be prosecuted and saying that the law perhaps

18

protects them but not me, but I am invoking their rights.

19

The argument he makes is that regulation of sexual

20

intimacy in the privacy of the home by a law this sweeping

21

is subject to heightened scrutiny and there is no severabili

22

clause in this law as there wasn't in Carey or Zablocki.

23
24
25

This is not, for example, one of the five states
that outlaws sodomy only between people of the same sex.

32

QUESTION:

Which cases do you particularly rely

MR. TRIBE:

Well, we think with respect to the

15

home dimension we rely heavily on Stanley, where the idea

16

that it was a First Amendment right surely will not wash

17

19

the material, no right to sell it, no right to show it

20

to consenting adults in public, only a right to enjoy it

21

in private.

22

With respect to the intimacy dimension, we rely

23

heavily on Griswold and on Eisenstadt to show that Griswold

24

cannot be limited to married couples.

25

And, with respect to both, we rely on the
33

1

fundamental principle recognized in the concurring opinion

though it might be appropriate in regimented context such

as the policy or military.

appropriate in dealing with all citizens in the privacy

QUESTION:

This Court has never held it

How do you articulate this right or

this process of declaring a — you say it is a fundamental

10

right or is it a — how should we go about identifying

11

some new right that should give protection?

12

MR. TRIBE:

Well, Justice White, I think that

13

the method that this Court used in both Griswold and in

14

Roe of looking to tradition in terms of the protection

15

of the place where an act occurs and of looking to a traditio

16

iji terms of recognizing autonomous personal control over

17

intimacy is an appropriate process to employ.

18

It seems to us that it is easier using that process

19

to conclude that this case implicates a fundamental right

20

and even to conclude it in Moore v. East Cleveland, because

21

as the tradition of family is — In your dissenting opinion

22

Constitution like marriage and family and in favor of the

14

more functional approach that would look to the distinctively

15

personal aspects of life that are being regulated in settings

16

distinguished, as the Court put it, by solace, selectivity

17

and seclusion.

18

Now, if liberty means anything in our Constitution,

19

especially given the Ninth Amendment's proposition that

20

it is not all expressly enumerated, if liberty means anything

21

it means that the power of government is limited in a way

22

that requires an articulated rationale by government for

23

an intrusion on freedom as personal as this.

24
25

It is not a characteristic of governments devoted
to liberty that they proclaim the unquestioned authority

of big brother dictate every detail of intimate life in

2

the home.

3

What sense would it make to say that the govern­

4

ment cannot order its regiments in the home, if it could

5

regiment every detail of life in the home.

6

does it make to use the apparatus of the Fourth Amendment

7

with the controversial exclusionary rule to protect the

8

privacy of the home if the Constitution is insensitive

9

to the substantive privacies of the life within the home?

10

What sense

It seems to us that if the protections of the

11

Third and Fourth Amendments are not to be reduced to error

12

and empty formalisms, that they have to reflect an underlying

13

principle, a principle not unlike that which this Court

14

recognized in decisions like Meyer and Pierce and more

15

recently in Moore v. East Cleveland.

16

Those underlying principles, I think it is

17

important to stress, do not place on a constitutional

18

pedestal as though receiving this Court's particular

19

approval, the particular acts involved in a case like this.

20

I think in that sense it is misleading to say that we are

21

championing a fundamental right to commit a particular

22
23

sexual act.
We are saying that there is a fundamental right

24

to restrict government's intimate regulation of the privacies

25

of association like in the home.

The principle that we

champion is a principle of limited government, it is not

2

a principle of a special catalogue of rights.

3
4

Robert Frost once said that home is the place,
where when you go there they have to take you in.

5

I think constitutionally home is the place where

6

when the government would tell you in intimate detail what

7

you must do there and how to behave there, they have to

8

give you a better reason why than simply an invocation

9

of the majority's morality which tautologically would

10

vindicate without any scrutiny by this Court literally

11

every intimate regulation of everything one can do in the

12

home.

13

It doesn't denigrate the special place of family

14

and parenthood and marriage in our society to recognize

15

the principle of limited government.

16

if there is something special and unique about parental

17

authority it is that we do not cede to big brother the

18

same unquestioned deference that children are perhaps suppose

19

to give to their parents.

20

On the contrary,

When the government would tell people in this

21

much detail how to conduct their intimate lives and doesn't

22

apparently have a good enough reason to keep Mr. Hardwich

23

in something other than a limbo in which he could be

24

prosecuted any time until August under this extraordinarily

25

sweeping law, when it does that, it seems to us that it
37

is fully respectful of history and tradition for the

2

Eleventh Circuit to have said you owe Mr. Hardwick a better

3

reason and you owe the people of the United States a better

4

reason than simply unquestioned deference.
And, I think Justice Harlan, if the issue had

5

6

been properly posed in Poe v. Ullman which, of course,

7

didn't involve this, would have recognized that requirement

8

of meaningful justification.

case.
QUESTION:

Mr. Tribe, I am curious to know, you

13

have referred to Justice White's opinion in Moore v.

Cleveland.

Do you think that opinion helps you or hurts

MR. TRIBE:

16

Oh, it certainly hurts more than

it helps.

19

some hope.

20

I was suggesting, however, that even that

Your opinion in Moore v. East Cleveland is

21

considerably more helpful, because in that opinion you

22

talk about the meaning of private property which is also

23

involved in this case.

25

there can be regulated by the state because they think

it is an irresponsible liaison.
It seems to us that the very meaning of home

3

is denigrated if that can be done.

4

only a principle of limited government that makes it

5

important to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's decision that

6

heightened scrutiny is required in such a case.

7

QUESTION:

It seems to us it is

Let me ask you one other question

8

which is really about Justice White's opinion which seems

9

to assume that a law that has some impact on liberty must

10

have some utility or — his exact line which is must hc.ve

11

a purpose or utility.

12

MR. TRIBE:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

That is right.
What is your understanding of the

purpose or utility of the law of the state in this case?
MR. TRIBE:

My understanding is that Georgia

16

refuses to tell us other than to say that the acts

17

involved we say are immoral.

18

they are the definition of evil, although half the states

19

have decriminalized them.

21

review endorsed by Justice White's dissent in Moore which

22

requires some meaningful explanation of how this law would

23

function to advance the public welfare, why it wouldn't

24

be counter-productive, why it wouldn't cause more contempt

25

for law than respect for families.

Three times they say

They refuse to advance a purpose

It is in that respect that even the form of

Some explanation is

2

And, if one reverses the Eleventh Circuit's

3

decision and allows the flat and unexplained dismissal

4

of the district court to stand, the-message of that is

5

the state need not offer any explanation, no utility, no

6

function.

7

most of us thinks it is wrong and a lot of people have

8

thought it was wrong for a long time, therefore, ask us

9

no further questions.

10

It is enough to say we passed it, that means

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Tribe, under your analysis

11

what sort of explanation would be required?

12

that if the state were to assert its desire to promote

13

traditional families instead of homosexual relationships

14

would not suffice in your view and yet that is an

15

articulate — potentially articulate reason.

16

state can say its desire to deter the spread of a

17

communicable disease or something of that sort.

MR. TRIBE:

Yes.
Now, what suffices here?
As to the first, if the State of

Georgia were simply defending — Might I finish the answer
to this question, Mr. Chief Justice?
If the State of Georgia were defending its
refusal to sanction homosexual

marriage, there would be

a close connection between that and the first rationale.

The connection, however, would be so weak between this

2

sweeping law and the rationale of endorsing or helping

3

marriage that I doubt that would- work.

4

As to avoiding the spread of communicable

5

diseases, the American Public Health Association, at page

6

27 of the amicus brief, they think that this law and laws

7

like it would be counter-productive to that end, but you

8

don't even reach that issue until you have some kind of

9

meaningful inquiry.

10

Surely, if a narrowly tailored law could be

11

shown necessary to protect the public health, that would

12

be a compelling justification, but Georgia offers no such

13

justification here.

15

Limited government, we think, makes the
Eleventh Circuit's decision correct.

It is inherently

The State of Georgia

In summary, the liberty that exists under our

it is not licentiousness.

It is ordered liberty,

If the Eleventh Circuit's decision is affirmed
