The decision of the Court of Appeals that the

of a superseding indictment is inconsistent with the

The Act also contains a minimum time period.

That is (c)(2), the defense preparation provision that

In

this case, that first appearance was on February 18 when

It stops the speedy trial clock, it allc.s a judge to
stop the clock by granting a continuance of whatever

defendant.

The length

of the continuance can be one, as

21

that applies where a superseding indictment is returned,

2

but that is the section that protects a defendant from

being rushed to trial before he is ready in light of any

4

changes that have been made in the superseding

5

indictment.

7

The decision of the Court of Appeals also
conflicts with the legislative history of the Speedy
Trial Act.

The theme that pervades the legislative

8
9
10
11

history both in 1974 when the statute was originally
enacted, and again in 1979 when it was amended, was the
desire of Congress to accelerate criminal trials.
Congress enacted the Speedy Trial Act to protect the

12

public's right to speedy justice.

As originally

13
14

enacted, the statute contained only maximum time
limits.

There was no mandatory minimum preparation

15

period for defendants.
16

In 1979 Congress considered amendments to the

17
18

Act.

It was urged by both the Department of Justice and

the defense bar to extend the maximum time limits of the
19

20

Act, but Congress held fast in its view that the minimum
30 day period — that the 70 day maximum time limit

21

22
23
24
25

should be retained, that the public's right tc a speedy
trial had to be protected.
Instead, to ensure that a defendant was not
rushed to trial before he was ready. Congress amended

If the original indictment is

dismissed on motion of the defendant, the defendant does

MRS. STEHLERs

— of dismissing that original

Right.

13

MRS.

STEHLERs

But in my view, that's an

irrational distinction.

purposes like dropping defendants or dismissing certain

HRS. STEHLERs

under your submission?
No.

I think we could not.

The

way the statute is written, dismissal is mandatory where
the 70 day limit has been violated.

I think by

including that mandatory dismissal sanction, Ccngess has
preempted the harmless error rule for that situation.
The statute does provide, however, that the
dismissal can be with or without prejudice.

If it’s

without prejudice, the government can reindict and then
try the defendant again.

That’s — that is, I don’t

know if you want to call that a version of harmless
error or what you want to call that, but if we get a
dismissal without prejudice, we do have the opportunity
to start the case over by reindicting.

reading of the language of the harmless error rule, a

MS. CLARKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
By the use of the word "superseding" in front
of the term "indictment," the government in reality is
20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

asking this Court to allow the government to have

2

control over the defense preparation period.

3

what Congress did.

4

That’s not

Prior to the mandatory defense preparation

5

period being inserted into the Speedy Trial Act,

6

Congress became convinced that the courts were not

7

capable because of the pressures of the Speedy Trial Act

8

of exercising the necessary discretion to adequately

9

protect the rights of the defendant to be prepared, and

10

that’s why we cannot turn the mandatory defense

11

preparation period into a discretionary period.

12

It’s mandatory, it must be read as mandatory,

13

and the fact that the government places an adjective in

14

front of the term "indictment” cannot change the meaning

15

of the word "indictment."

16

QUESTIONi

But it is mandatory, as I read it,

That's right.

11

Congress did to that, it was, Congress said

liberalized, they did not restrict,

And the only cornerstone that you can hook

Otherwise,

20

you are building in discretion into the act.

would then become confusing as to the application of the

I couldn’t have

QUESTION;

Oh, I think you could have.

MS. CLARKE;

That’s exactly what Congress did

because what happened when the Speedy Trial Act came in
15

in 1975 is it created an extreme artificial pressure on
16
17
18

the trial courts of this nation to try cases fast.

They

said to the trial courts we know you don’t want it, but
here’s the Speedy Trial Act, and you’ve got to try this

19

20

case within 60 or 70 days, whatever the time period was
at that time.

And the courts were saying, yeah, we know

The problem with reading the (c)(2)

5

6
7

the Congress gave

provision,

the defense preparation period, as other than mandatory
when the government chooses to file a superseding
indictment is that it creates a great deal of

8

uncertainty in the system, will be festering a great
9

deal of litigation over «hat’s material, is there really
10

a need for this defense preparation period.

You'll have

11

the criminal defendant back in the position of having to
12

say to the trial judge I really need this period of
13
14

preparation, and again you have the outer time limits
crushing down on the trial judge, and the trial judge is

15

going to say, criminal defendant, Congress told me to
16

try this case within 70 days.

I've got time for you

17

now .
18

QUESTIONS

But isn't it true that if the

19

defendant says I need 30 days and therefore extends the

MS. CLARKE:

Mr. Bojas didn't get it.

Mr.

didn't get it.

government, he was not prejudiced by the failure to get

But under, under what you propose,

6

you can have a situation where the 30 day period no

7

longer relates to the original indictment, but the 70

8

day period continues to relate back, and it would be

9

impossible for the government to go to trial at all, and

10
11

that is obviously an absurd result.
So to make the 70 day period and the 30 day

12

period co-exist, you pretty much have to adopt the rule

13

that the government espouses here, don’t you?

14
15

NS. CLAFKEt

T disagree, and I disagree with

the basic premise flat the question is founded upon.

16

First, a superseding indictment is not -- does

The government did not move to

dismiss the first indictment until the time of

QUESTIONS

Well, what difference does it make

whethar the government dismisses or doesn't, in your
view?
MS. CLARKE;

Well, one, it makes a great deal

of difference because the statute is very, very
specific, and the statute does net talk about
indictments that overlap.

The indictment talks about

the government dismissing and refiling.

The purpose

behind (h)(6), that provision that regulates government
conduct —

Now, let's

say that of course — from custody because there would
have been no charge pending, and I think that's what

But let's say that the government had

10

QUESTION;

But that's not this case.

I mean,

11

you — here the government filed a supervening

12

indictment to change by a very small margin what

13

apparently was a typographical error on the date.

14

NS. CLARKE;

Well, the record

reflects that

15

the prosecutor said that there's a typographical error.

16

The racord does not reflect in fact it was a

17

typographical error, and we should assume that grand

1f

juries sign indictments that they mean,

y

and they sign

indictments based on the evidence that they hear.

So

20

I'm not sure that I'm necessarily willing to concede

21

that it's a typographical error.

22

But Justice O'Connor, you do bring up the

23

critical statutory construction problem with the issue

24

that's before the Court.

25

(h)(6) was to restrict the government and net to hurt

But because the purpose of

32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

the defendant, it*s very consistent to read into (h)(5)
that any time the government would be in the position of
violating the 70 days by its late filing of a
superseding indictment, that (c)(2), the defense
preparation period, acts as its own continuance
provision, its own exclusion, and activates the ends of
justice, or there's nothing wrong with saying to the
government you are the party that delayed in filing the
superseding indictment.

You are the party that should

have known what your indictment should say.
party that's made this deliberate choice.

You are the
Flace the

burden on the government to obtain the ends of justice
exclusion provision because I think that when the
government files outside of the first 30 day period,
they are going to run into some trouble with 3161(b)
which requires that any indictment filed in a criminal
case must be filed within 30 days of the arrest of the
def end an t.
So if the government files outside of the 30
day period, I think they're going to be running into a
violation of the (b) provision, and they're going to
have to justify to the Court the late filing of that
superseding indictment anyway.
QUESTION;

Ks. Clarke, do you think a

superseding indictment was necessary in this case at

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

all?

2

MS. CLARKE*

Well, that's questionable.

I

3

think that the government — and the position they took

4

before the District Court is that they could have

5

requested an amendment or the striking of the

6

surplusage, and that the District Court could have done

7

that.

Had they done that, I do not think that the

defendant would be entitled to a second

(c)(2)

8
9

provision.
QUESTION*

You wouldn't be here at all.

10

MS. CLARKE*

We wouldn't be here on

(c)(2).

11

We might be here on (h)(8)(R)(iv ) , but we would not be
12

here on

(c)(2).

The basic response to that is that

(c)(2),

the mandatory defense preparation period, just

13
14

is net the answer to all of the ails of the criminal
15

defendant, and that's precisely why Congress injected
16

the discretionary continuance provision.
17

Congress gave us two, two preparation
18

periods.
19

One they said is mandatory, and one they said

is discretionary.

And the mandatory one they had to

20

give to the courts to relieve the pressures of those

outer time limits ani to inject balance into the

system.

discretionary solely at the hands of the government,

Yes, the magistrates who take

court.
The second basic issue that the government
raised in its brief and to which we respond is that of
harmless error, and in reality, the harmless error
argument is again the same argument, just couched in
different terms, because if the harmless error concept
applies to a mandatory time limit such as the 30 day
time limit, then the time limit is gone, in reality.
And Congress gave a rigid statutory scheme, they created
the 30 day defense preparation period because of the
demands placed on the courts.

MS. CLARKE;

First, there was no — there was

no showing of prejudice made by counsel below because

7

counsel below was relying on the governing law of the

8

Ninth Circuit and the language of the Speedy Trial Act.

9

The prejudice — and I'll have to speculate, as I did

10

for Justice Marshall — is that the defendant, when the

11

date was changed, lost the defense to the charge, and at

12

that point had no opportunity to go back and re-evaluate

13

his position, had no opportunity to go back and reopen

because we can't depend on the District Courts to grant

subsection (b)

where we return superseding indictments

13
14

after those 30 days have elapsed.
At worst, had

we gone to trial in this case on

15

the original indictment an the proof had shown that the
16

prior conviction was on

December 7 rather than December

17

17, that would have been an immaterial variance, and
18

Respondent could still have been convicted cf

the felony

19

illegal entry charge.

So Respondent was not deprived

of

20

a cognizable defense.
21

There is simply nothing in the record that

shows that the defendant was prejudiced in any way, and
23

therefore it’s completely at odds with the purpose of
24

the Speedy Trial Act to reverse the conviction in this

case simply because a needless delay was not given, that

2

the delay was — that the trial was not unn ecessarily

delayed for 30 days.

QUESTION*

I don't recall what th e rule

provision is, if any, on amending indictmen ts.

rule governs that?

MRS. STEMLER;

What

I don't know, Your Honor.

8

It's — Respondent says Rule 7, but I am no t sure, Your

Honor.

Therefore, we ask the Court to re verse the
judgment below.

12

Thank you.
