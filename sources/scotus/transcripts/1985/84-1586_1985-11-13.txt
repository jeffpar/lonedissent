BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

SHEADEL*

Thank

you, Hr.

Chief Justice,

it please the Court:

9

Today this Court is faced

with

the question of

10

the extent of a police officer's civil liability for

11

damages resulting from an arrest made

12

warrant which the police officer

from a neutral

can a police officer who applied for and obtained an

2

actions should be protected from suit for the same

3

reasons, the same policy concerns, that have been

4

enunciated by this Court in its decisions regarding

5

immunity and where to draw the line between immune

6

actions and non-immune actions.

7

In this context, the police officer's

In deciding where to draw such a line, the

8

Court has recognized that the answer must be found in a

9

balance between the evils inevitable in either

10

alternative, recognizing that in any balance drawn not

11

all interests can be protected.

12

In such a balance,

the Court has recognized

13

that on the one hand it is trying to vindicate

14

constitutional rights,

15

trying to protect officials who fre required to exercise

16

discretion in fulfilling their duties.

while on 1 he other hand it is

17

In determining the extent of any such

18

immunity, the Court nas considered two factors.

19

first factor considered by the Court has been the

20

function performed by the official in question and the

21

historical extent of the immunity that's been granted tc

22

that function.

23

The

The second consideration has been the policies

24

that exist in applying that immunity to the action at

25

question.

In applying this standard to this case,
U

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

the

1

function that we're examining is the function of a

2

police officer in applying to a magistrate for an arrest

3

warrant, and the question then becomes should

4

function receive a full exemption from liability.

5

this

We believe that this function should receive a

6

full exemption from liability.

7

about the functional analysis of the police officer

8

applying to a magistrate for an arrest warrant is that

9

the function that the police officer is performing is

Our primary argument

10

very similar to the function of a prosecuting attorney

11

in placing information before a arani jury and asking

12

the grand jury to find that probable cause exists and tc

13

indict.

14

QUESTION*

Ms. Sheadel, do you concede that

15

the facts that were available here were not sufficient

16

to justify the issuance of a warrant?

17

!?S. SHFADEL*

We would not concede that there

18

was absence of probable cause in this case, Your Honor.

19

But we do not believe that whether or not this Court

20

believes that probable cause existed would be

21

determinative in the case.

22

QUESTION*

Well, if

you would assume for a

23

moment that the facts were insufficient to amount to

24

probable cause and if the warrant had issued and

25

evidence obtained as a result of it, would the evidence

be excludable in your view under the Leon case at

2

trial?

3

MS. SHE ADEL:

Using

the Leon case, it's

4

possible the evidence could be excluded.

5

Leon factors are such that it would require a very

6

specific analysis of the situation in this case.

7

QUESTION:

Again, the

Why should a different rule apply

8

than in insulating the officer from any damage liability

9

than the rule that would be applied for exclusion of

10

evidence under

Why shouldn't these two track each

considered some different factors.

16

17

it would question a magistrate's immunity from civil

18

liability because the magistrate is involved in the

19

decision to issue the search warrant or the arrest

20

warrant.

21

it would seem that, since the magistrate made a decision

22

that shouldn’t

4

MS. SHFADELs

Yes, I believe that was

7

the factors considered in whether or not immunity should

be applied.

9

In the civil liability aspect,

Instead of using the word "deterrence," I

process in deciding whether or not there are these

alternatives available,

checks and balances that are inherent in that process.

similar for several reasons

2

prosecuting attorney and the police officer are required

3

to use a discretionary judgment based on their evidence

4

in their possession on where they're going to take this

5

case at this point.

First,.both the

11

question into the judicial proceeding, in two ways.

Both of these decisions put the

12

The first way is by putting that actual

13

determination of probable cause into the judicial

14

proceeding, asking a aeutrr.l and detached body in the

15

judicial process to make that decision, the magistrate

16

of course being the neutral and detached body that the

17

police officer is seeking review from and the grand jury

18

being the neutral and det?chad body that the prosecuting

19

attorney is seeking review from.

20

The second way that it's brought into the

21

criminal proceedings is that if the grand jury decides

22

to indict and if the magistrate decides to issue the

23

warrant, criminal prosecution

24

proceedings have begun, with all of the checks and

25

balances, all of the protections inherent in those

(202) 628-9300

criminal proceedings.

2

Therefore, we believe that this function of

o

the police officer and the function of the prosecuting

4

attorney are so similar that the immunity granted to a

5

prosecuting attorney for the function that he performs

6

should also be applied to the police officer in this

7

situation.

8
9

We bedieve that the Court's policy reasons for
applying immunity also apply in this case.

In deciding

10

whether or not to apply immunity, the Court has

11

considered several policy factors, and we believe those

12

policy factors can be summarized in three areas.

13

One area, the first area, is whether or not

14

the action occurred within judicial proceedings.

15

second is whether or not the action taken is likely tc

16

result in retaliatory lawsuits.

17

whether or not there are sufficient safeguards to

18

establish the accountability of the official.

The

And the third is

19

The Court's policy concerns first center

20

around whether cr not the action occurs within the

21

judicial proceedings.

22

granted any kind of absolute immunity, it has always

23

been within the judicial process, except of course for

24

that instance in which the President of the United

25

States was granted immunity because of his very special

In every case when the Court has

(202) 628-9300

1

and unique function in our system of government,

2

every other case, absolute immunity has been granted

3

because of an action that has occurred within the

4

judicial process.

5

Rut in

The Court has stated that it is very concerned

6

to make sure that the integrity of the judicial process

7

is insulated from lawsuit, that the actors in the

8

judicial process should be free to act on their own

9

convictions without fear of damages liability.

The

10

Court has encouraged and has stated the need for

11

principled and fearless decisionmaking, wanting the

12

official in question to put energy and effort into the

13

duties of his office rather than diverting them to fight

14

off lawsuits that may be filed.

15

The Court has

:elt that these interests are

16

especially involved in

17

justice and that there is a need to avoid the adverse

18

effect in the functionir.g of the criminal justice system

19

that less than this immunity would in fact allow.

20

the proper administration of

We believe, of course, that this is inherent

21

in the situation in this case because, as we have said,

22

this instance, this action, is part of the judicial

23

proceeding, the question and the issuance of the warrant

Let me ask you a sort of a

hypothetical question about the extent of your

have been objectively unreasonable for the officer to

assuming it's objectively unreasonable.

12

on the certiorari list in which the claim was made that

13

the officer went in to the magistrate and the magistrate

14

in effect rubber stamped the application for a warrant.

15

He said;

16

whatever your name is, and I. know you’re reliable;

17

don’t even have to read the application because I know

18

you’re always going to -- you're not going to coma in

Would you say that if the record disclosed

22

should be immune if he came in with a plainly

23

insufficient warrant application?

24
25

NS. SHEADEL;

And if so,

why?

We believe that the Court’s

analysis in civil liability would in fact give the

2

immunity, for the same reasons that it has given the

3

magistrate absoluta immunity for that Kind of function,

4

or the same reason that it has given the prosecuting

5

attorney absolute immunity.

6

The Court has not distinguished in those

7

situations where a magistrate or a prosecuting attorney

8

has done something that would be considered objectively

9

u nreasonable.

QUESTION*

What if there are falsehoods in the

application for a warrant?
KS. SHEADEL*

Same immunity?

That's a question that we have

i3

not asked the Court to directly address in this case,

14

since it is not raised.

15

there would be concerns about this.

16

However, we understand that

Again, looking at the traditional analysis,

17

falsehoods would be absolutely immune.

18

that there are concerns with police officers that might

19

not exist with

the police officer should be immune.

2

that failure can never be attributed to the police

that magistrate, even though he may be objectively

QUESTION*

11

NS. SBEADELs

Yes.
Vhat this Court has recognized

12

in its policy considerations for alternatives that are

13

available, the Court has recognized that civil damages

14

are not always available for a wrong that is done.

15

when it has looked at alternative safeguards.-

16

said that it is looking not for an alternative that is

17

functionally synonymous with civil damages, but looking

18

to see what safeguards are inherent in the system.

19

And

it has

One of those safeguards inherent in the system

20

is in fact that you are part of the judicial system.

in question.

So that's a case that would be

MS. SHE’DEL*

Yes.

I would emphasize that,

that we do see sone policy differences between a warrant

17

We don’t believe that issue needs to be

we do realize that there might be some different kind cf

policy concerns in an application for an arrest warrant

6

-- I mean, for a search warrant, that do not exist in an

7

application for an arrest warrant.

9

The second policy consideration that the Court
has identified is whether the official’s actions are

10

likely to result in retaliatory lawsuits.

11

important to the Court, especially within the judicial

12

process, because the Court feels that within the

13

judicial process there are cases that arouse the most

14

intense feelings in the litigants and these feelings are

15

not easily capped by a judicial decree or decision.

16

pewer of the state is being exercised in the courtroom

17

or in the judicial process, and the Court has recognized

18

that it is natural that there will be resentment,

19

there will be intense emotions involved in whatever

decision is made.

This is

And because of that, because of that intense

22

emotion, there is the possibility of scores of lawsuits
