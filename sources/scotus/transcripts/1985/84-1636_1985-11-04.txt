offense, as what is admitted during the jeopardy barred
trial, a per se rule of automatic reversal can only
serve to force the defendant and the prosecution to yet
a third proceeding.
QUESTION*

Nr. Drake, would all the same

evidence be admissible, in your view?
NR. DRAKE*

In the case before the Court, all

the evidence would be admissible had the Respondent in
this case been indicted for murder; in other words, had
the prosecution not sought the enhanced penalty, and we
are talking here about an enhanced penalty case, the
evidence would have been identical.

I guess your -- the Respondent

takes the position that not every bit of that evidence
would be admissible at the new trial?

before this Court, he fails to identify one iota of
evidence that came in, in the jeopardy barred trial,
that would not have come in in the murder trial.

In other words, but for the commission of the bank

10

statements at the trial in question, the defense

attorney informed the jury that defense did not contest

12

the fact that the Respondent was a participant in the

13

bank robbery.

14

Upon exiting the bank the witness saw a

15

vehicle and reported the license number, and a high

16

speed chase immediately ensued.

17

the Respondert and his accomplice went to a farmhouse in

The chase ended when

A verbatim transcript

Of material import# Respondent said, and I

8

quote, "I said to myself real quick that if he was dead

9

I could say that I was kidnapped and they couldn't prove

10

that I robbed, the bank."

Respondent later gave a tape

11

recorded confession where he reiterated his — the

12

reason for the homicide to cover up the bank robbery,

13

escape culpability, and perhaps return and recover the

14

$15,000 in stolen money which he had hidden.

15

After his confession Respondent was indicted

16

for what is called aggravated murder, which is that he

17

did purposely cause the death of another and the

18

aggravating circumstance here being that of fleeing from

19

an aggravated or armed robbery, the distinction between

20

simple murder, which is the highest level of homicide in

21

Ohio, and aggravated murder is that the Ohio General

22

Assembly has made a legislative judgment that a murder,

23

an intentional killing committed under certain

24

circumstances, here while fleeing a bank robbery,

25

warrant enhanced punishment.

robbery, is an element of the crime it is not a lesser

Mr. Drake, why would the State

allow the entry of the guilty plea to robbery when it

of death suicide, and they also were confronted with the

Well, I thought that the correct

16

information had been made available before the entry of

17

the guilty plea.

MR. DRAKE*

The forensic pathologist from

19

Cincinnatti, Ohio, had forwarded his findings to the

of remedy, at this juncture.
QUESTION*

2

Hay I go back, since you have been

3

interrupted, to Justice O'Connor's question earlier

4

about whether the same evidence would have been

5

admissible in the trial for the lesser offense than was

6

actually received.

7

Vitale, the Ohio Court of Appeals reduced the charge, as

8

I understand, reduced the sentence.

After our remand in the light of

9

Did they base that on just an automatic rule

10

that that took care of the double jeopardy problem, or

11

did they also decide that the evidence would have been

12

the same anyway?

13

remember.

Or, they didn't reach that, as I

HR. DRAKE*

14

Yes.

Upon remand from this Court,

15

it was never — the spillover prejudice argument was

16

presented for the first time in the Federal Circuit

17

Court.

18

Your Honor.

19

It wasn't even presented to the District Court,

I rather vehemently objected to bringing it up

20

at that juncture, but as the Court below indicates in a

21

footnote they found my arguments to be —

22

QUESTION*

At the time of the remand in light

23

of Vitale, was there another argument before the Ohio

24

Appellate Court or did the Court just take the case and

25

then issue its judgment?

(202) 628-9300

ME. DRAKE!

1

2

Your Honor, I honestly do not know

if there was additional briefing or additional argument.
QUESTION*

3

One of the things that's worrying

4

me about the case, if the issue should be controlling,

5

and I'm not saying it should but as Justice 0 'Connor

6

raised the question, I'm just wondering, where in the

7

first instance should the decision be made as to whether

8

there would have been some admissibility problem in

9

another case?
I hate to get into that myself as a federal

10

11

judge.

I just wonder what your views should be on hew

12

that should be done.

13

ME. DRAKE*

Most assuredly, had the issue been

14

raised the Ohio Appellate Court would have been forced

15

to make that assessment.

16

raised before the Ohio Appellate Court.
QUESTION!

17

As I .indicated, it was not

But you're also not sure they had a

18

chance to raise it, as I understand, because there may

19

not have been briefing at that time?
MR. DRAKE*

20

I really do not know, Your Honor,

21

correct.

I do know that the issue wasn't -- they

22

certainly had the chance to raise it in the Supreme

23

Court of Ohio and lid not.

24

QUESTION!

25

MR. DRAKE!

I see.
And they had the chance to raise

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it in the Federal District Court and did not, and in the

2

first instance raised it in the United States Court of

3

Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

4

certainly abandoned it rather expeditiously.

Had they raised it, they

As I indicated, it is briefed before this

5

6

Court, the Respondent does not articulate so much as one

7

piece of evidence that was admitted in the enhancement

8

homicide trial that would not have been admitted in a

9

trial for so-called simple murder.
In such circumstances, to mandate that both

10
*

11

the prosecution and the defense suffer yet a third

12

proceeding is not only not commensurate with the double

13

jeopardy values, but actually frustrates the very value

14

of finality.

15

prosecition, subsequent to an earlier — for the same

16

offense, subsequent to an earlier conviction, is

17

grounded upon an analysis that you want to prevent both

18

prosecutorial overreaching, bad faith, there is no

19

allegation of that hare, and you want to promote

20

finality.

The prohibition against the second

Any precept of finality has been totally

24

is clearly commensurate with perceived violation.

2

you will, to the analysis used in misjoinder of offense

cases where we're talking about a state court

4

defendant, must demonstrate actual prejudice»

6

QUESTIONS

Hr. Drake, we're dealing with a

7

constitutional violation.

Does that mean we have to

8

apply a Chapman type standard?

9

MR. DRAKEs

No, Your Honor.

I don't believe

10

Chapman is engraved in granite for all constitutional

11

violations.

12

cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth

13

Amendment, surely the conviction would not be reversed

14

but the sentence reduced.

For instance, were this a violation of the

Were this a Sixth Amendment ineffective

15
16

assistance of counsel case, there is a rule of automatic

17

or per se reversal on such a demonstration.

18

instance the supposed violation of the double jeopardy

19

clause was remedied when the defendant was placed in the

20

position that he should have been.

In this

The proceeding itself should not have

21

22

occurred.

I would note that Respondent here did not

23

endeavor to take an interlocutory appeal once the trial

24

judge overruled his motion to quash the indictment,

25

which could have in theory at least prevented this

1

entire difficulty.
QUESTION*

2
3

Sell, what's the standard, no

reasonable possibility of prejudice?

4

MR. DRAKE*

So.

The standard that is — as we

5

suggest, and I believe is the appropriate standard, is

6

that used for misjoinder of offenses which is that the

7

accused, the Respondent here,

8

specificity those items of evidence that were admitted

9

that were otherwise inadmissible, and must demonstrate

10

actual prejudice as a result of that admission.
QUESTION*

11

12

must articulate with

You think the burden of proof is on

the defendant?
MR. DRAKE*

13

That’s correct, because we’re

14

essentially talking about a iue process rather than a

15

double jeopardy analysis.

16

that he — what the Respondent endeavors to do here is

17

to garner relief from the double jeopardy clause when

18

he’s already been afforded that relief.

The double jeopardy clause

19

He can taka that extra step.

20

demonstrate that evidence was admitted, and that

21

evidence resulted in actual prejudice to himself, then

22

the conviction must be vacated and he must be afforded a

23

new trial.

24
25

If he can

This case is very much akin to the resolution
that this Court made in Benton versus Maryland.
1 4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Unfortunately -- fortunately that case came upon direct

2

review and the conviction which was alleged to have been

3

tainted as a result of this spillover prejudice was

4

remanded to the state judiciary for review in light of

5

the state's evidentiary principles, which is the common

6

sense approach.
Here, what the Petitioner wants to do — this

7

8

is unlike a typical constitutional violation,

9

violation, search and seizure violation, where the

10

a Griffin

violation of the Constitution itself is concrete,
i

11

identifiable, and is the issue before the Court.

12

What the Respondent wants to do is take an

13

entire trial that might span weeks and look to mere,

14

simple state evidentiary principles, materiality,

15

hearsay, et cetera and ask the federal judiciary to get

16

involved in an ad hoc analysis of whether or not the

17

s;tate judiciary would have made the same evidentiary

18

rulings.

19

This Court has nev^r taken that Draconian step

20

and there is absolutely no precedent for that, and again

21

I would indicate that this case is a Benton versus

22

Maryland spillover prejudice type case.

23

To reverse this conviction, as I stated

24

earlier, would serve no useful purpose.

The remedy

25

here, afforded to the Respondent years ago, is
1 5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

commensurate with the violation.

If the Respondent can

2

take the extra step and indicate that he was prejudiced

3

by having to defend the greater charge, so be it.

4

does not articulate one item of evidence that came in

5

tht otherwise wouldn't have come in.

He

Unless the Court has questions I would like to

reserve the balance of my time.

10

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT

11

MR. DANE*

12

Mr. Chief

13

Justice, and may it please the Court, I ask the Court on

14

behalf of the ResponJent to affirm the decision of the

Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in this case.
I make that request on the basis of reasons

different from the reasons used by the Sixth Circuit

Court of Appeals.

QUESTION*

Well, do you defend those reasons,

MR. DANE*

Your Honor, I think that the Sixth

or not?

22

Circuit decision was right in its consideration of the

23

fairness of the trial, but I don't believe that it

24

appropriately considered fairness because I believe that

20

QUESrI0N*

Do you contend, Mr. Dane, that the

relief awarded by the Sixth Circuit is the proper relief?
MR. DANE*

Your Honor, I agree that granting

21

the writ of habeas corpus is proper.

The Sixth Circuit

22

decision says it is remanded for retrial.

23

position there cannot be a retrial on this indictment

QUESTION*

1

It struck me as a rather odd form

2

of relief for a claim of double jeopardy violation tc

3

award the prisoner a new trial.

4

MR. DANE*

I don't believe I disagree with the

5

Petitioner that that is what the Sixth Circuit did.

6

What the Sixth Circuit did was grant the writ of habeas

7

corpus ordering that the Petitioner — the Respondent be

8

released from custody unless the State of Ohio takes

9

action to bring about a new trial within the 60-day

10

period of time.
*

The State of Ohio can, quite simply by not

11

12

acting, bring about the conclusion that the Petitioner

13

should simply be released on the writ.
QUESTION*

14
15

But it would also be free under ihe

Sixth Circuit's reasoning to retry him?

16

MR. DANE*

That's correct.

17

QUESTION*

Would it be under your reasoning

19

MR. DANE*

On a new indictment, yes, sir.

QUESTION*

And that's the relief he gets for a

claim of double jeopardy?

should not have reached the consideration of the

fairness of the trial, Tour Honor.

not have been admissible, but I also take the position
that the question of fairness or unfairness -- I’m not

11

15

here to argue that the right was violated because the

16

trial was unfair.

17

I’m here to argue on behalf of Mr. Matthews

13

that the right was violated because the trial took

19

place, and he can only be protected in that respect by

20

an interlocutory appeal as recognized in Abney and not

21

on direct review through modification.

of this case, where the Respondent could in fact be
