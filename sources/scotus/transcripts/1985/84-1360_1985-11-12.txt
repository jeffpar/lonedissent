You'll recall that in 1976 in Young v.

Does the record show us whether the

thoroughly familiar with the City, was constantly

about the nature of the area that was left over.

2

was an island with no bridge that you had to swim to to

get to your adult theatre, I think, that would be very

quite relevant.

You will see the set-aside zone in grey, here, in

the heaviest color, and you will see running east-west,

just north of there, a very heavy line which is Route

If you follow Route 405 up north where it

the Renton and Roxy Theatres were located, those were

the two that

Those are only, really,

There is another theatre just south of that,

It seems to us that there are three, basically

5

three issues here, and that the Ninth Circuit was wrong

6

on all three.

7

we are allowed, we're allowed to look at the experience

8

of other cities in passing this ordinance, and the Ninth

9

Circuit said

10

The first issue really relates to whether

that we could not.

QUESTION;

In that regard, Hr. Prettyman, the

11

ordinance of this City was justified on the secondary

12

effects that these theatres have on particular other

13

land uses, like residence land or churches or schools.

14
15
16

Now, does the record show us whether the City
relied on evidence of that sort gathered in o^her cities?
HR. PRETTYMAN;

Well, I think the most obvious

17

example is the City of Seattle, where Seattle was —

18

Seattle had 13 adult theatres.

19

downtown; three were out in

20

were the three that they were concerned about.

21

Ten of them were

residential area lf and they

One of them was all by itself in a residential

22

area, and Seattle passed its zoning ordinance in order

23

to get all of them into a kind of bad area right

24

downtown rather than out near residences, and so we were

25

looking at that example.
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) (28-9300

1

I might also say in regard to Yeung —

2

QUESTION:

And did Seattle's studies show the

3

secondary effects of having an adult theatre in a

4

residential neighborhood?
MR. PRETTYMAK:

5

Yes, ma'am, they did.

They

6

showed that,

that they caused transience to come in.

7

They showed an increase of crime, and they showed, in

8

effect, that property values would go down.
One of the things that I think people forget

9
10

when they look at Young is everybody concentrates on the

11

fact that the prescription was 1,000 feet from any two

12

other adult uses.

13

ordinance, it also prohibited adult theatres within 500

14

feet of residences, and that particular prescription

15

wasn't even fought in this Court, I assume, because it

16

was assumed to be, assumed to be constitutional.

What they forget is that in the Young

But that was part of the Young ordinance, and

17
18

we had tha': tc look to, and therefore ours is really a

19

tighter and more permissive ordinance in that respect

20

than —

21

QUEST 10\T:

Detroit and Seattle were doing it
/

22

two different ways; Detroit by dispersal and Seattle by

23

concentration ?

24
25

MR. PFETTYKAN*

Yes,

that's exactly right.

And different cities have used different methods.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

This

Court said in Young that it made no difference# really.

2

In fact, you approved both methods, both the dispersal

3

method and the concentration method.

4

said that in Young, and as a matter of fact you even

5

said that that was true as to theatres in general, that

6

they could be dispersed; that, in other words, the way

7

that you deal with the problem is constitutionally

8

irrelevant.

are residences, and two little churches as a matter of

question.

the First Amendment.

They --

They sent it back for allowing to

shore up the record, in effect.
MR. PRETTYMAN;

20

Well, that was rather

21

strange.

The reason, if they are sending it back, they

22

are sending it back because they thought that a

23

motivating factor, at least there was an inference that

24

a motivating factor might be that we were trying to

25

suppress First Amendment rights.

Our response to that is twofold.

1

First of

2

all, Your Honor, why are you looking at intent or motive

3

in a case where you have a substantial government

4

interest and only an incidental restriction on First

5

Amendment rights.
You didn't do it in Young, although there was

6
7

a suggestion there that there might have been a bad

8

motive.

9

that was clearly argued that they had a bad motive, so

You refused to do it in O'Brien, even though

10

you never get to —

11

QOESTIONs

I understand your argument on the

12

merits of the motive,

13

it clear that they have already directed the district

14

judge to hold the ordinance invalid?

15

but if that issue remains open, is

MR. PR3TTYMAN*

Oh, I think that's quite

clear. Your Honor, that they have said that it is, that

it violates the First Amendment.

Yes, absolutely.

then,

let me simply say in regard

21

to, I believe T have mentioned that the second issue

22

relates to the set-aside zone itself; the nature and

23

content of this zone.

25

directly to this question.

11

But it seems to us that the plurality really

goes directly to secondary theatres.

13

fact that these are showing films which, in a separate

case in the state court right here in Fenton in an

(202) 6.O-9300

1

certain things are not, are not, we just can’t assume

2

that they exist as a matter of experience.
The only thing that this Court found as a

3
4

matter of experience that they could rely on in Young

5

was that congregating various types of uses together

6

produced a detrimental secondary effect, and that effect

7

was a deterioration of property values.
But I think you have to look at what happened

8
9

in Young.

There, you had an ordinance that had been in

10

place for years.

11

what Young did, or Detroit did, was they added adult

12

theatres to those regulated uses, and said these uses,

13

all of them as a whole, when they congregate together,

14

they produce this adverse secondary effect of a deletion

15

in property values.

16

It regulated many kinds of uses, and

That is not the case here.

What this

17

ordinance does and what Renton has done is said

18

single adult theatre in a commercial zone, not in regard

19

to other businesses that may be regulated or may net be

20

regulated, because it doesn't regulate any other kind of

21

business, that that single adult business will cause

22

these deleterious effects.

that the City of Renton was not entitled to rely in

drafting its ordinance on whatever experience the City

13

of Seattle might have had?

14

MR. BURNS *

Your Honor, if the City of Renton

15

is going to r =ly on Seattle's experience, it should

16

target the same evils at which Seattle targetted its

ordinance, and it should rely on the same means.

18

It should not be able to say —

which cannot he sanctioned in any sense.
What Renton is suggesting to this Court is a

3

rule that would allow it to state a governmental

4

interest and say that we have made available permissible

5

locations, and then insulate that decision forever from

6

judicial scrutiny, and that rule, I don’t believe, can

7

be accepted by this Court.

8
9

The essential difference between this case and
Young is that there is an intolerable burden on speech

10

that exists as a result of this ordinance, and that’s

11

problem of access.

12

If government makes no rule about access and

13

does not limit access to speech, then there's no

14

intrusion that can be blamed on the government and no

15

violation of the First Amendment.

16

On the other hand, if government dees make the

17

rule and government does limit access, then I think

18

government has th* duty to establish that not only are

19

there permissible locations, but that somebody can

20

actually go there, because otherwise they’ve precluded

21

them through a de facto zoning scheme from going

22

anywhere, and they’ve created what they’ve perhaps set

23

out to do, was censor the material and remove it

11

sensitive to the concerns that exist.

have zoned these theatres out of the commercial areas as

that pervades Renton's ordinance is that there's a need

to protect certain places, schools, churches, and so on

from adult theatres.

5

the whole purpose of this ordinance is nullified by the

under-inclusiveness of the ordinance.

But that need, that express need,

This ordinance deals only with adult

theatres.

There is no evidence in this record or

theatre has a different operational characteristic or

effect upon these places than other adult businesses

1

H ell. Your Honor, I think that

2

where you have an area that will accommodate over 400

3

theatres and it’s readily a ccessible and criss-crossed

4

by roads, the most that you 've got is an inconvenience,

5

Somebody who may want to be downtown and see one is

6

going to have to drive for a little bit.
QUESTIONs

7

Mr. Pr ettyman, I take it that your

8

opposition indicated that t here was sufficient proof of

9

probable injury to resident ial neighborhoods, that

10

availability wouldn’t make any difference,
MR. PRETTYMAN;

11
12

availability wouldn’t make any difference?
QUESTION;

13
14

I f there was sufficient proof,

No, no , no.

If there was

sufficient proof of harm to residential neighborhoods —
MR. PRETTYMANi

15

I don’t go that far.

I don’t

16

say that if you had harm to residential neighborhoods

17

you could zone them; you co uld do a Schad.

18

that.

19

I don’t say

And I think the r eason, Justice White, is that

20

there would then have to be some accommodation.

21

might have to, you might ha ve to restrict your area from

22

1,000 feet to 500.

23

some fashion to make sure t hat there was some outlet for

24

this expression.

25

You

You mig ht have to accommodate in

QUESTION;

But yo u think that whatever,

whatever threshold availability there was was passed,

2

here ?
MR. PRETTYKAN*

It's clearly that in this

case, yes.
The only other point I would make is that he

5
3

said that we zoned him out of the commercial area.

7

didn’t zone them away from the commercial area, we zoned

8

them away from residences and churches and stuff, and it

9

just so happened that in our city they’re all mixed in

10

We

with the commercial zone, so they’re not right downtown.
But let me pose this question to you.

11

Do they

12

have a right, do they have a constitutional right to be

I

where they want to be, where most customers are walking

sJ

14

by the door, where they don’t have to put up signs

15

because there’s so irany people walking by that they’ll

16

get a ready audience?
Or can we put them away from where they’re

17
18

doing tie harm but

19

have plenty of filr , plenty of theatres, plenty of

20

access, and everybody can see what they want to?
And with that, I hope very much that you'll

21

22

25

ihere people can still go, you still

reverse.
