ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
13. CHASEi

Mr. Chief Justice, and if it

please the Court*
The issue in this case is the validity of

10

Pennsylvania’s rule permitting the Commonwealth to

11

appail an insufficiency determination made at the close

12

of a timely rights case.

13

very little discussion or analysis at a time when the

14

Double Jeopardy Clause did not apply to the states.

15

The rule was established with

With this case it suddenly became a rule in

16

search of a rationale.

with two counts of murder and various lesser charges as

18

a result of i fire in a restaurant-apartment building

that they owned.

The trial

was non-jury.

The case was largely

circumstantial.

23

Commonwealth’s evidence.

that we call a demurrer in Pennsylvania, a demurrer to

25

the evidence.

Ac the close of tie Commonwealth’s

They did this with a motion

The issue raised by a demurrer to the evidence

1

is tna same i-s the issue nisei by a Hule 29 motion in

3

federal court.

If it's true, is it enough.

The court found that the evidence, even if

4
5

true,

was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable

6

doubt that either of the defendants set the fire.

Yes, but the Commonwealth had

rested.

The court, however, denied demurrer with

16

respect to involuntary manslaughter and various lesser

17

charges involving a reckless state of mind.

18

The District Attorney's office appealed the

19

order sustaining tie demurrer and asked that trial of

20

the remaining charges be stayed depending the outcome cf

21

the appeal.

22

for reconsideration of the order sustaining the

23

demurrer, and the Commonwealth presently finds it

24

significant, as tnay indicite at footnote 11 at page 46

25

of their brief, that the defendants at that juncture

The District Attorney's office also asked

joined in the Commonwealth's request that the ruling in
favor of tie defendants be reconsidered.
We put our reasons on the record at the time.
Defendants wanted so desperately to complete the trial
on the involuntary nanslaughter anl toe remaining
charges that they were willing to suffer the
reiistatenant of the murder charges with all the risks
tha* that entailed, so that they could complete the
trial rather than have the trial interrupted for an
appeal.
QUESTION;

Ms. Chase, in Pennsylvania do you

have to lemur to tie evidence at tie close of the
prosecution's case in order to later make a motion for
judgment n.o.b. if the jury convicts you?
MS. CHASE;
QUESTION.:

My understanding is, you don’t.
Because I was wondering, if the

defendants were so anxious to have the trial completed,
they could have foregone the demurrer to the evidence..
MS. CHASE;

That’s true.

Tiey had lived in

They didn’t want to be in

there anot.ier six veeks putting in their defense, and
they wanted to know, what charges did we already win cn.
It was just, basically, a matter of economy at
that point.

But, you demurred across the beard?

Naturally.

We wanted to know

where we stood with the court on all the charges, so
that we should know what charges we should direct our
defense to.
On reconsideration the court reaffirmed its
original order.

Tie remaining charges were stayed over

our objection pending the outcome of the appeal.
Two and a half years later the Superior Court
quashed the appeal on double jeopardy grounds and
invalidated the Pennsylvania rule.

They reconfirmed

that decision on re-argument about a year later.

About

a year ago the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania reversed
and remanded

to the Superior jourt for consideration of

•the merits of the Commonwealth appeal, and it was at
that juncture that we asked for certiorari.
The Commonwealth's position, as I understand
it, is that since the trial judge made no decision with
respect to credibility in ruling on the sufficiency of
the evidence, his decision does not go to the factual
elements of the crime.

It’s unrelated to factual guilt

or innocence.

1

SssentiaLLy, the Commonwealth looks at Scott,

2

sees the words "factual guilt," and thinks that this

3

Court is saying that there is another, unrelated kind of

4

guilt.

5

Scott that suggests that kind of distinction or that in

any way suggests tnere has to be a credibility

think 3urks is clearly to the contrary.

I can find no language in either -Martin Linen or

What do they mean, a credibility

11

MS. CHRSSi

rfhat they’re saying is, since the

12

judge did not determine whether the evidence presented

13

on behalf of the Commonwealth was true, but assamei it

to be true for purposes of deciding on the demurrer, his

ruling was not an arguittaL.

MS. CHASSi

That’s the Commonwealth’s

21

position.

I would submit also that this case presents a

22

stcoager case against allowing review than Martin Linen

23

because in Martin Linen the defendant had been looking

24

at retrial before the insufficiency decision was made,

25

because the jury had been discharged without reaching a

but the decision

was still an acquittal.
I note tiit there his basn some disagreement
within this Court as to whether every refinement of
double jeopardy law as developed ia federal cases

lad barrel to the states.

I would

hope that however that debate ultimately turns out, the
States will not be held to be free to avoid the finality
of acquittals by calling acquittals something else when
they're entered at the close of the Commonwealth's case,
a stage well after waen tae defendant has been placed in
jeopardy.
I would hope also that the states are not
going to be free to hold that a defendant waives his
Double Jeopardy rights by asking to be acquitted.

The

rights LqvdIv9i here lay not be quite as fundamental as
the right not to be retried after a classic, traditional
jury verdict of not guilty,

but I would submit that they

are certainly not peripheral or incidental to the
purposes of the double jeopardy clause.

I would point out also that if this trial is
resumed as the Commonwealth suggests, although the
prosecutor doesn't get to re-do his case in chief, he
doesn't become a bystander merely because he's rested.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. E3SRHARDT*

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*
Tha xattar bafoca t.n a Court raises an

24

important question relating to the proper role of the

25

Pennsylvania trial judge in deciding whethar a criminal

n

case shall proceed to verdict.
Ia the Cobbonwealth*s vis*, the trial judge .in
this case was not asked to sit in judgment,

but rather

was requested to determine that judgment could not be
entered at all in this case.

The motion made below by

the respondents was reflective of Pennsylvania's desire
for specificity and particularity when raising claims of
sufficiency of the evidence, in the context of the legal
standard to be applied in evaluating the evidence.
Clearly, a trial judge has a separate function
in determining whether or not there is sufficiency cf
evidence factually to determine guilt, as opposed to
determining whether or not the law requires that the
judgment be sought in a particular case.
The Commonwealth is very aware of this Court's
discussion with regard to the talismanic nature of
particular words, a ai the Zomnonw ealtn doesn't want to
rely on the word "demurrer” as providing any special
significance in and of itself.

However,

the term

"demurrer” is reflective of Pennsylvania's desire that
was set forth in the case of Martin Linen Supply, that
the feieral system did not provide, that is, a
restriction on the power of the trial judge to rule in
midtrial, requests regarding the sufficiency of the
evidence as a matter of law.

11

the crime, that the crime nas been committed.

12

There is a different mental process that I

13

suggest is important to reflect and to be recognized in

14

a system such as Pennsylvania's.

15

QUESTION*

Under Pennsylvania law, that stage

16

is the judge sitting as the tryer alone, to decide

17

whether, had there been a jury, he would have said there

22

Is that the derision he makes?
That's the particular request

that's made of the judge at that point in time.
23ESTI3N!

Then, is the judge now in effect

24

saying to the state, "If that's all you've get you

25

haven't got anything"?

that,

Right.

The court is saying

"With my understanding of the law and the legal

definition of tha crime, the evidence that you have
presented does not support sufficiently the elements of
the offense established by the legislative definition."
So, whatnar wa'ra talking about a jucy trial
or non-jury trial with regard to the demurrer, the same
standard is being requested of the court.

However,

Pennsylvania goes on in its rules to recognize that at a
later stage after all the evidence has been introduced
in t.na particular nattar, that tha trial judge is being
asked to decide a different question.
The judge is being asked in a non-jury
situation for the equivalent of a verdict.

Clearly, that is the classic situation where

there is an application of the Double Jeopardy Clause.
What the Commonwealth is suggesting is that
the Pennsylvania procedure here is not providing, at
this staga in tha trial, tnroagh demurrer, tha
equivalent of a not guilty verdict by a jury.

has made an err or nf law tint it uses to resolve the

What wa're suggesting is,

The court is being asked, classically at

common law under a demurrer, and under Pennsylvania

practice, to make a legal measurement of the sufficiency

13

of tne evilence against a frameworc.

14

Commonwealth cannot argue on appeal that the court used

15

the improper framework in measuring the sufficiency of

the evidence, then the Commonwealth would not have the

10

Do you think that’s the same thing

that tne attorney for the State of Pennsylvania is

arguing?

13

MR. FREY*

I'm not sure it is the same thing

14

as they are arguing, but I think the important guestion

15

is whether — I mean, I think there is an initial

16

guestion that the Sourt has to grapple with, ini that

17

is, if this animal that we have is a determination by

18

the judge that the defendant hasn’t committed a crime,

19

then can it ever be appealed and corrected, regardless

20

of what is wrong as a legal matter with that

21

ieteraination.

22

Because, there are suggestions, I think in

23

Martin Linen and some suggestions in Scott that it

24

couldn’t be, and we are asking the Court to reconsider

25

that question in terms of the policies of the Double

There's no problem with the holding

That is our feeling, that's right.

But, I think that Scott has undermined Martin Linen and

I think it's appropriate for the Court to reconsider

MR. FREY*

Certainly, Justice Cardoza in Palco

against Connecticut thought that would be a better
system, but at least there we don't know what the jury
has done.

The prosecution has failed to convince the

first fact finder, and the considerations that are
/

identified in Green do apply.

In this situation, none

of those considerations have any application.
How, I should say a word in connection with
your question about Sanabria, because Sanabria is a case
where essentially that happened, that is, the evidence
was suppressed.

Wh a t was left was insufficient.

The

judge granted an acquittal.
ie have no problem with the correctness of
Sanabria, because we couldn’t appeal the evidentiary
suppression rule.

Because that was so, when the judge

granted an arqaittii, there was no evidence.
