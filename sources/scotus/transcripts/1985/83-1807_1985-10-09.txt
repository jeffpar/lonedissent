establishes the limit on liability.

some indication of the scope of that limit.

5

as to when the liability is to be valued so that the

6

limit can be placed on it.

It also gives us

12

it provides that:

"In the transportation of

Now, the liability is obviously specific.

13

It's for 125,000 francs.

14

that is the liability "shall be limited."

15

most important concept in this sentence is what the

limit applies to, and that is the limit applies to the

17

"liability of the carrier for each passenger."

Plaintiff's damages so that the Plaintiff will receive

And the standard way, the way this delay was

10

taken account of here, was to provide prejudgment

interest by method of a formula, that is, a fixed rate,

system instructs its courts, its jurors,

to simply value

16

Under either of those systems, some

17

prejudgment interest passes to the Plaintiff, and under

18

either of those systems that prejudgment interest in our

19

view is part of the carrier’s “liability for each

20

passenger. ”

21

Now, I’d like to turn next tc the second

22

sentence of Article 22.

This sentence indicates the

23

time at which the limit is to be applied.

24

"Where, in accordance with the law of the court to which

25

the case is submitted, damages may be awarded in the

form of periodical payments, the equivalent capital

2

value cf said damages shall not exceed the sum of

3

125,000 francs."

4

Now, the first thing to point out about this

5

sentence is that, as with the rest of the convention,

6

this sentence presupposes that the liability of the

7

carrier will be established in a judicial proceeding.

8

The sentence speaks of there being a court of law to

9

which

10

the case is submitted .
But the sentence also indicates -- it deals

11

now with a situation where the judgment will not be for

12

a lump

13

order to pay out various payments over a period of

14

time.

15

payments contemplated by this section are to be

16

capitalized to the date of the award,

17

amount of the award cannot exceed

18

19

sum, but the judgment will be in the form of an

In effect,

Now, we have some further help in this regard

21

from the original version of the Warsaw Convention.

22

text that you have before you, the English text, uses

23

the word "damages."

24

in the official French version of the convention is

25

"indemnite."

The

The corresponding word that appears

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

If one consults the French legal dictionary

2

that this Court relied upon in Sack's, a dictionary

3

published in

4

reparation or compensation.

5

"indemnite" is "indemnity conferred by judgment," and

6

that "it ordinarily takes the form of damages and

7

intere st."

That dictionary says that

If you fit this together, what we draw from

8
9

1931, "indemnite” is defined as a

this sentence is that, when damages and interest are

10

awarded, not in the form of a single lump sump, but in

11

the form of periodic payments, the capital value of that

12

award shall not exceed 125,000 francs.

13

from that is that Article 22.1 indicates that the limit

14

imposed by this convention is to be applied to the

15

carrier’s liability as of the date of the judgment.
I'd like to turn next to Article 24 of the

Sc what we draw

convention.

Article 24 --

QUESTION;

18

Before you do that, hr. Sharp,

19

has your research disclosed in the way of cases from

20

other countries who are parties to the treaty with

21

regard to their interpretation of Article 22 and its

22

meaning?

23

MR. SHARPs

Your Honor,

I can report three

24

cases, none of which have a reasoned opinion, but

25

proviie results.

One case is reported by Professor
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

what

1

Drion in his treatise, and I believe we have cited that

2

case in our main brief.

3

which interest is awarded in a commercial case in excess

4

of the limit.

5

It is a case from Brussels, in

There are two cases cited in our reply brief,

6

one from France and one from Great Britain, in which

7

interest is not awarded in excess of the limit.

8

of those cases can we find any explanation for the

9

court’s reasoning or the result.

10

11

QUESTION;

In none

Have you found any cases since your

briefs were filed?

12

HR. SHARP;

We have not, Your Honor.

We have

13

consulted with various experts and we have looked at

14

LEXIS.

15

At the sams time, I must say to the Court that

16

this is an area of research where one cannot, be

17

confident that nothing exists after one has looked.

18

simply do not have the tools to deal with these 120

19

signatory nations that may or may not be deciding this

20

issue.

21

But we have nothing to offer the Court, either

22

on behalf of the Plaintiff’s position cr cn behalf of

23

our position, that would be instructive to the Court.

24
25

We

I want to return to Article 24,

then, of the

convention, and that article is found at page 4 of our

(202) 628-9300

1

reply brief.

2

intended reach of the limit is all-inclusive.

3

this article there is very elaborate cross-referencing,

4

and I intend to omit that.

5

This article in our view shows that the
How, in

The core language of the article begins in the

6

third line in the middle, an the core language is that:

7

"Any action for damages, however founded, can only be

8

brought subject to the conditions and limits set out in

9

this convention."

10

Now, the key phrase in this sentence is the

11

phrase "however founded."

12

saying that,

13

Plaintiff in the way of a remedy, whatever Plaintiff’s

14

theory of the case may be of whatever the legal basis

15

may be for Plaintiff’s case, h’is suit is subject to the

16

limits of liability set out in this convention.

17

The sentence as we read it is

whatever the local law may award to the

Now, the provision also confirms that the

18

liability that is regulated by the convention is a

19

liability that is determined in a court of law.

20

again, the official version in French is possibly more

21

helpful than the English version.

22

Here

The version you have before you speaks of

"any

23

action for damages."

The French text refers to an

24

action "en responsabi1ite," which translates, we think,

25

one for one to "liability."

In other words, the French
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

text contemplates that there will be an action to

2

establish liability or an action for liability.

3

And when we turn from the terms of the

4

convention, which in our view show that the limit is to

5

cover judicially determined liability, turn from the

6

convention to the Montreal Agreement --

7

QUESTION;

Before you do that, Mr. Sharp, did

8

you find any discussion of this issue in the minutes of

9

the convention or in earlier drafts of the convention?

10

MR. SHARP;

Your Honor, there has never been

11

to my Knowledge in reading through these minutes a

12

detailed discussion of the points that I am making at

13

this time.

14

held in 1929 — that was Mr. Henri Deveaux -- prepared a

15

memorandum, if you will, of explanation as to what the

16

meaning of the draft proposal was that was before the

17

conferees that were meeting in 1929.

18

The recorder for the convention that was

In the course of Mr. Deveaux‘s explanation as

19

to the limit on liability, Mr. Deveaux says that this

20

limit is intended to apply to the carrier's "maximum

21

liability."

22

it was to be the liability judgment that was imposed

23

upon the carrier.

24
25

He think that is a strong indication that

There is in Hr. Drion's book a discussion of
whether or not prejudgment interest, interest awards

generally, are included within the limit or whether or

2

not they can escape the limit.

3

that they are within the limit.

4
5
6

And Kr. Dricn concludes

Those are the two sources that I would mention
to you .
QUESTION;

Well, I suppose there are other

7

writers who disagree with that view and say it's an open

8

question, isn't that so?

9

KR. SHARP;

I think that there is a suggestion

10

to that effect in the Shawcross and Beaumont text.

11

trying to collect now all of the discussions.

12

we have covered the principal discussions of the point.

13

I am

I think

I'd like to turn now to the text of the

14

Kontreal Agreement.

15

text are printed at page h of the blue brief, and it's

16

the first three lines that begin at subparagraph

17

and those lines state;

The relevant provisions of that

(1),

18

"The limit of liability for each passenger fcr

19

death, wounding, or other bodily injury shall be the sum

20

of $75,000 inclusive of legal fees and costs."

21

Now, what happened here was that when the

22

delegates met in Kontreal they knew that some nations

23

were awarding attorney's fees and costs to the

24

passengers and that in some instances the awarding of

25

attorney's fees and costs meant that the carrier was

paying out a total that was greater than

2

f rancs .

3

125,COO

It was based on that knowledge that the

4

delegates provided that the limit that you see here

5

should be increased to $75,000, but that limit should be

6

inclusive of legal fees and costs.

11

QUESTION;

Kay I just ask this question?

You

12

don’t deny that it might cover postjudgment interest,

13

that postjudgment might be recoverable?

14

MR. SHARPs

15

QUESTION;

We do not deny that.
And I’m just wondering, would you

16

think that a signatory state could decide fcr itself

17

whether postjudgment interest should be set to run from

18

the date the trial court judgment was rendered in one

19

country and another one might decide it should be after

20

all the appellate process has run its course, which

21

might be a difference of a couple of years in some

22

countries?

23
24
25

Could a country decide for itself the date
from which postjudgment interest will run?
MR. SHARP;

I think so, Your Honor.
13

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Our view

1

is that once the convention has placed a Judgment in the

2

hands of the passenger, it has spent its course and

3

whatever the —

4

QUE STION;

Mould a country be free to decide

5

that postjudgment interest should run from the date that

6

the lawsuit started?

7

ME. SHARP;

I think not, because then I think

8

you're in the period -- the liability cf the carrier tc

9

each passenger in the period that the convention speaks

10
11

to.
QUESTION;

You'd say that the line would be

12

drawn at -- they could fix the date when the judgment

13

was rendered, but not some earlier date, such as the

14

date the complaint --

15

MR. SHARP;

16

QUESTION;

17

That's right.
-- was filed or the date the

Plaintiff's evidence went i n or something like that?

18

MR. SHARP;

That's right.

19

Now, the Montreal

Agreement we submit also

20

makes it clear that for purposes of applying the limit

21

one should look at the carrier's liability as finally

22

determined in a judicial proceeding.

23

because the fees and the costs do not. exist at the time

24

of the accident, and thus the limit cannot be read as

25

applying simply to those items of liability that may be

We say that

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

deemed to have arisen at the time of the accident.

2

There is in

the negotiating history, then,

3

further confirmation of our position.

4

negotiating history suggests that the limits in the

5

Montreal Agreement and the Warsaw Convention were

6

intended to cover the full extent of the carrier’s

7

liability.

8
9

We think that

As I responded to Justice O’Connor’s question,

Mow, the courts below looked to the Montreal

purpose sprang from that agreement.

19

light of that new purpose, it was permissible to award

20

prejudgment interest in excess of the limit.

21

They found in the

QUESTIOMt

Certainly the Montreal Agreement

22

was motivated in part by a desire to speed settlement

23

and provide for an earlier resolution of claims falling

24

under the convention.

25

is there left to encourage speedier resolution of

If your position is correct, what

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

claims ?
This case is a rather good example of what

2
3

some might call dilatory tactics on the part of the

4

carrier, and I just wonder what you think is left for

5

the encouragement of speedy settlements if your position

6

on the treaty is correct?
HR. SHARP;

7

Your Honor, if the limit on

8

liability is recognized by the Plaintiffs and the

9

Defendants as being a guillotine that cannot be escaped,

10

you have created the ideal environment for settlement.

11

It's when one or both of the parties dc not know whether

12

they can break the limit.
I would give you as an example this case, in

13
14

which Eastern made an offer of judgment to the Plaintiff

15

in 1978 in the sum of ^150,000, which would be the

16

equivalent of $75,000 for both Hr. and Mrs. Mahfcud.

17

That offer of judgment was in the Defendant's view an

18

offer to pay its maximum liability.
It was not accepted because in the Plaintiff's

19
20

view,

21

thought was the maximum liability.

22

an absolute limit, that is the best hope for expediting

23

settlement in these cases.

I might say that the minutes of the Guatemala

convention are discussing whether or net they should

2

lift the willful misconduct exception to the limit sc

3

that they can then put before the parties an absolute

4

limit that tells them really what they should settle

5

against.

6

QUESTION;

But if the carrier knows that it's

7

likely to be hit with the maximum liability under the

8

treaty and it can stall around with its defense of the

9

lawsuit for years and not incur any interest as a result

10

of it, I don't understand why it's motivated to go ahead

11

and pay it out right away.

12

MR. SHARP;

Sharp, in connection with these

8

questions, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit

9

in its opinion that it handed down, as I recall in 198C,

10

stated that Eastern did not deny liability for the

11

$75,000 to the proper parties, is that correct?

12

MR. SHARP;

13

QUESTION;

That is correct.
Did Eastern consider then

14

depositing $150,000 in the court, subject to the

15

determination of who the proper parties were?

16

HR. SHARP;

There is no indication of that.

17

What I would say to you, Your Honor, is that Eastern

18

offered every Warsaw Plaintiff an offer of judgment in

19

an amount of $75,000,

Pardon me?
That was an offer of settlement.
Yes.
Right.

But my point is, what did

Eastern have to lose by depositing the money earlier

Meanwhile, it had the use of that

MR. SHARP;

Your Honor, I don't know that it

ever considered whether to deposit or not tc deposit.

8

think that most defendants hold onto the money until

9

they can get a discharge from the plaintiff.

That’s the

10

one thing they have to win, is when they pay they want

11

to leave the case, and that's what Eastern wanted.

HR. SHARP;

QUESTION;

17

The plaintiff doesn't get the money

when it’s with the registry of the court.

14

16

I

That's right.
But the interest on 5150,000 over

seven years is quite substantial.
MR. SHARP;

That's right.

Your Honor, the

18

only thing I would point out there is that the Plaintiff

19

has never moved for a complete summary judgment against

20

Eastern, and if they had Eastern would have certainly,

21

as its offer of judgment suggests, been prepared to pay

22

the limit; and if the court had ruled

23

interest also had to he paid in a summary judgment

24

proceeding, that would have concluded the litigation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE EDKIN FARE ElI, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS

13

The Plaintiff's position

ME. FARRELL;

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

please the Court;
The basis of Petitioner's argument seems tc me

16

to be that the limits of liability stated in Warsaw and

17

Montreal can't be exceeded, no matter what.

18

was never intended by the delegates at Warsaw or

19

Montreal, nor by any of the high contracting parties who

20

ratified the treaty.

21

Mow, this

The delegates at the Warsaw conference were

22

not making a wrongful death statute.

They were trying

23

to establish air law.

24

articles they promulgated were dependent upon national

25

law for implementation.

They full understood

that the

11

this was going on until the Hague conference in 1955.

Ho one outside the United States even knew

Mr. Sharp points out that Mr. Deveaux thought

13

that the damages should be limited or that there should

14

not be any way to exceed the damages limit.

15

his country, as reported by Mr. Drion, whc also awarded

16

interest in addition to the costs and

17

Mr. Drion further said that the attorney's fees and

18

costs are not damages arising from the conduct or the

19

fact for which liability is imposed by the convention.

20

Obviously, the same reasoning could apply tc interest in

21

excess of the Warsaw convention limitation, as interest

22

is not an element of damages.

23

Yet, it was

attorney's fees.

Thus, from the very beginning the Warsaw

limitations were routinely exceeded.

Of course, this permits the ceiling on damages

Now, we had some discussions of Articles 24

and 28, but before getting to those I would like tc

respond to Petitioner's comments from reading Article

22.1 and his finding of apparently a

17

dictionary which changes the words.

18

The Congressional

1932 French

Record, which reports the

Senate’s action on the Warsaw Convention, dated June

20

1934 , has the word "damages’* in it.

"Where, in accordance with the law of the ccurt to which

22

the case is submitted, damages may be awarded in the

As previously in its brief,

the Petitioner has

agreed that this means that under 22.1 if ycu have

the use of money.

9

Now, probably the real key tc this case is in
Article 24, which provides that the law of the court

10

that hears the case shall determine the elements of

11

damages.

12

Petitioner concedes that the proper wrongful death law

13

to be applied is the law of Louisiana, where this case

14

was brought, including its conflict laws as well as its

15

law pertaining to judgment interest.

16

it is that he doesn’t think that prejudgment interest

17

could be awarded.

18

Now, this is a wrongful death case.

The

court determined the loss under each of these categories

23

and awarded damages against the United States and

24

Eastern Air Lines in the amount of 5f*£50 ,000, as I

25

previously mentioned.

The trial

Of that amount, $150 ,000 was

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

assessed against Eastern for the two deaths.
In making its determination for the lost

3

support portion of the damages award, the court first

4

determined the loss from the time of death until the

5

time of trial, using decedent's income at the time of

6

death projected forward, and then determined future loss

7

of support by

using projected income from date of trial

8

until date of

majority of the three infants, reduced to

9

present value.

10

Thus, the damages judgment was based upon the

11

value of the human life at the time of death.

12

then ordered the application of prejudgment interest

13

from date of what they

Thus the district court, pursuant to its law

as the court before which the action was brought,

19

determined that damages accrued at the time cf death and

20

Eastern was liable for $75, 000 per decedent, the maximum

21

damages pursuant to the Montreal Agreement.

22

The court then determined, pursuant to Article

23

28, that Eastern was further liable to pay interest from

24

the date that the action was filed as compensation for

25

the use of money rightfully belonging to the Plaintiffs

That provision states;

"Where, in accordance

This provision specifically permits a court to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

add interest to a damages award when payment is delayed

2

and, as admitted by Eastern, provides compensation for

3

the use of money, or interest.

4

Petitioner admits by delaying payment

5

rightfully due to three orphaned children it put £87,000

6

into the pockets of Eastern's insurance company.

7

Instead of paying £75,000 per death, it actually paid

8

approximately £31,000.

9

The action of the Louisiana district court was

10

absolutely proper under its law, and it is not in

11

violation of any articles, neither Warsaw nor Montreal.

12

And if anything, the result is no different than the

13

periodic payment provision of Article 22.

14

Now, the Petitioner in its briefs has gone tc

15

great length in an attempt to establish that interest is

16

an integral part of compensatory damages.

17

jurisdictions throughout the world, this may be correct,

18

but as I — in response to Justice O'Connor's question,

19

the jurisdiction in which the action was brought,

20

Louisiana, and whose laws were properly used, as

21

admitted by Eastern, the practical application of the

22

Louisiana procedure is to establish a starting point for

23

compensation to be paid for the use of money at the time

24

the Plaintiff files his lawsuit and a termination point

25

when the judgment is paid.

ME. FARRELL;

down, Justice White, into loss of support, loss of

12

QUESTION;

And then did it have a separate

It says "interest pursuant to

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

The reason for the delay stems from an

2

agreement between Petitioner's insurance company and the

3

United States under which the insurance company agreed

4

to pay 60 percent and the United States 40 percent of

5

any passenger recovery, with the specific provision that

6

Eastern's insurance company was to have complete control

7

over damages discovery, damages trial, appeals, and any

8

decisions relating to the settlement or ncn-settlement

9

of a particular case.

10

This is the Petitioner's fifth appeal, four cf

11

which relate to Montreal damages.

12

as affirmed by the Court of Appeals, found that Eastern

13

contributed to delaying the litigation to an extent that

14

a smaller amount of money was invested in order to pay

15

the $75,000 claims.

16

The district court,

Petitioner admits that if this honorable Court

17

rules in its favor it will pay only 62 or $63,000 for

18

the two deaths, or about $31,000 each, instead of the

19

Therefore, at least $87,000 rightfully belonging to the

The decision of the district court, as affirmed by the

No, but there was a motion for

judgment was reversed on purely procedural grounds.

MR. SHARP;

QUESTION;

That is true. Your Honor.
But the Court of Appeals for the

Second Circuit didn't for a minute suggest that there

17

was any question about liability.

MR. SHARP;

That's right, and the Court of

Appeals in that decision —

20

QUESTION;

I just wonder -- the question

21

Justice Powell asked you some time ago;

22

least in 1978, why didn't you deposit the $ 150,000 so

Plaintiff?

MR. SHARP;

Well,

Why didn't, at

MR. SHARP;

Your Honors, our position boiled

down is that the purpose and the text of the Warsaw
