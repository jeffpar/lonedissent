from this Court, casas such as United States v.

HR. KAHTAGERER:

I would suggest, Your Honor,

that New York law would not require the exclusion of

evidence, that this is a case of first impression there.

9

The Court saw no need, as it has in so many

10

other cases, as I might

11

that Court, the Yew York Court of Appeals, is net shy

12

about making its opinion kqcwn when it feels that New

York law alone might require the exclusion cf evidence

although the Fourth Amendment does not.

15

point out, Justice O'Connor,

I would suggest that since this case came down

No.

What we were suggesting.

15

Your Honor, was that under Hew York law, because there

16

is an obligation to surrender one’s certificate of

17

registration, and that’s what VTL 401 is all about, that

18

the giving over of the certificate of registration is

19

meaningless if you can’t compara the registration

20

against the vehicle identification number.
We tried to draw an analog.

Because the

driver was required to hand over the certificate of

registration, there had

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Put what I think is critical once again is
that that was an argument that we made as a
justification for saying it fit in wit*', rhe general
scheme.

The Court rejected that argument.

But what

they did say was, assuming that statute doesn’t exist,
what you really have here is a violation of the Fourth
A mendment.
And,

as I read this Court's decision in

Michigan v. Long, I'd like to suggest that it's
precisely the type of

discussion that we're having right

now, about whether New York law might require or
wouldn't require, which has been eschewed by the Court's
determination in Michigan v. Long that we shouldn't be
getting into that type of a debate.
If the face of the opinion does not contain a
plain statement from uhe State Court saying, we are
deciding this essentially on an adequate and independent
state ground -- perhaps here the New Yo’-k State
Constitution or statute, It's not going to do that, that
opinion, and instead cites the Fourth Amendment
repeatedly, and cases from this Court repeatedly.

consistent with Michigan v. Long, has the jurisdiction
to consider and to decide this case.

diminution of sorts because in Michigan v. Long# as I

2

pointed out,, it had two citations to the State

3

Constitution.

4

Here we've got only one.

I've suggested to the Court that there are two

5

bases, or two sides of the line here, search or

6

non-search, and we suggest that we should prevail under

7

either.

8

constitutional law and as a matter of common sense, the

9

sounder conclusion is that no search did occur here.

But, we do believe that as a matter of

Why do I say that?

10

Because we know that the

11

term "search" has a very special meaning in the

12

decisions of this Court.

13

Government intrudes upon a reasonable, justifiable or

14

legitimate, if you will, expectatior

15

individual has, and we suggest to yc u that clearly,

16

under the circumstances of this case, the Respondent

17

could have had no reasonable expectc.tion of privacy.
Why?

18

There is no search unless the

of privacy that the

To begin with, we're dealing with an

19

automobile, not the individual's person, not his home,

20

not his office, an automobile which this Court has

21

recognized involves a reduced expectation of privacy in

22

the first instance.
And why is there that reduced expectation of

23
24

privacy?

Some cf the early decisions of this Court

25

noted the relatively open configuration of the Court —

Yet, what happens if you can't look at the

It means that the whole concept of regulating

like tha t ?
!fR. KARTAGENER;

Well, what happened. Justice

Stevens, was that as the car was stopped and pulled over
for the two traffic infractions,

the driver got out of

the car and proceeded back to the police car to speak tc
one of the officers who was standing there. Officer
Meyer.
QUESTIONS
incidentally?

Is that customary in New York,

Isn’t it good police practice tc keep the

supposed offender in the automobile?
MR. KARTAGENER;

Well, Justice Blackmun, I’ll

be quite frank about that.

The best police practice, I

do believe, and I’ve read some of the police training
manuals, is to keep the individual in the car on some
occasions, depending on the circumstances.
However, in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, it was
condoned to bring an individual out of the car if there
is a concern for the police officer’s safety.

There

doesn’t have to be a reasonable suspicion or anything.
Sometimes he'll bring the individual out of the car.
Generally speaking,

I do believe, police

officers maintain greater control by keeping the
individuals in the car.

But what happened here, it’s

not the police officer who got the individual out of the
car.

What happened was, answering Justice Stevens’
1 2
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

question, is that the car was pulled over.

Before the

2

police officers even got up to the individual’s car, the

3

Respondent here, the defendant down below, gets out of

4

his car and walks back to the police officers’ car.
As he was speaking to Officer Meyer, his

5

6

partner, his regular partner. Officer McNamee, walked up

7

to the Respondent's car to try to look at the vehicle,

8

inspect the Vehicle Identification Number.
What happened then?

9

He assumed because it was

10

an older car, and the earlier case before this Court

11

that he dealt with a very expensive car, this was not

12

such an expensive car.

13

was an older car.

14

the car door to look on the door jamb, did not see the

It

The officer assumed the VIN might be

He then knew that it would have to be in one

17
18

location, on the dashboard in a position that should be

19

viewable through the windshield, because mandatory

20

federal regulation now says that ever since 1969 the VIN

21

belongs there so everybody, including police officers,

22

can look at it.
And, what does he find?

23

A little bit of

24

paper, a mischievous scrap of paper, is covering the VIN

25

number.

So, although my adversary here —

ORAL ARGUMENT BY STEVEN R. KARTAGENER, ESQ.

6

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER -- Resumed

7

HR. KARTAGENER*

8
9

You may resume

I hate to leave a question

unanswered, and so if I may answer the question that was

10

asked of me by

Justice Stevens at the end of the

11

morning’s argument, the question was did the police

12

officer do anything with the Vehicle Identification

13

Number, if I rememner the answer correctly.
And the answer, Justice Stevens, is that he

14
15

never really had the opportunity to do anything with it

16

because as he was reaching into the car to move the

17

scrap of paper off of the VIN number he looks down, and

18

what does he notice?

19

underneath the seat -- he did not look under the seat,

20

bukt sticking out by about an inch is the handle of a

21

pistol.

22

Lo and behold, sticking cut from

He recovered the pistol and then the Vehicle

23

Identification Number became at least somewhat de

24

minimis because what they were confronted with then was

25

the felony of an unlawful weapons possession.
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

i202) 628-9300

1

But I would point out also, the defendant, the

2

Respondent here, did receive two traffic infractions

3

summonses in addition to being arrested for the felony

4

and to some extent the VIN number became at least

5

somewhat — or less important because they also

6

discovered during te course of their inquiry and

7

discussions with the defendant that he was an unlicensed

8

driver as well.

9

So, the likelihood is,

this was not going to

10

be the type of case where they would check a VIN number

11

and let the defendant perhaps drive on his way.

12

was a situation where he was not going to be allowed to

13

get back into that car and drive it.

14

QUESTION*

This

I would suppose your reasons for

15

wanting to know the VIN number to determine whether

16

maybe it was a stolen vehicle or something might have

17

been increased rather than decreased when you suspected

18

him of otner wrongful conduct ?

19

MB. KARTAGENER:

Wall, we do not suggest that

20

he was suspected of any wrongful conduct in the form of

21

a stealing of the car or anything like that.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

But then, why do you look at the

VIN number?
MR. KARTAGENER:
a number of reasons.

You check the VIN number for

The only way you can tell for sure
1 6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that a car is the car described in a registration

2

certificate or in an insurance card is by comparing that

3

number with the YIN number.

4
5

If you don’t make that comparison those pieces
of paper don’t mean that much, quite frankly.
QUESTIONS

6

Do you suppose that when they got

7

him down to the police station on the possession of the

8

gun charge, that somebody would check out to see whether

9

he was driving a stolen car at that time?
MB. KARTAGENER;

10

Well, certainly we would

11

suggest that under the circumstances, if he is going to

12

be arrested for the weapon, the police have an absolute

13

right to check the VIN number and if it turns out to be

14

stolen that would be an added charge that he was going

15

to face.

16

QUESTION*

Do you think there might be some

17

connection between this man’s cooperative conduct in

18

getting out of his car and uoing to the policeman,

19

the fact that he knew he had a pistol under the seat?

20

MR. KARTAGENER*

and

Well, I certainly think that

21

is a reasonable inference to draw from the

22

circumstances,

23

courts found that thare was some reasonable suspicion

24

tied to his getting out of the vehicle and walking over

25

to the police car, but I do not come before the Court

2

creates reasonable suspicion that the car is either

3

stolen or that there is a weapon in the car.

4

argue that.

QUESTIONS

I don’t

That's something for the fact

MR. KARTAGENERs

Well,

the facts found by the

8

lowest court, the Supreme Court, Bronx County, the trial

9

court, it was reasonable suspicion.

But the New York

10

Court of Appeals disavowed that and said that the

11

getting out of the car in and of itself does not create

12

that type of reasonable suspicion.,

13

When an unarmed man walks up to two

15

MR. KARTAGENER*

Well, that brings us, quite

16

frankly, to a latter portion of our brief which I'd like

17

to answer and that is, if we are going to be dealing

18

with the question of concern about the individual being

19

armed, and I would suggest that doesn't go to the

20

question of whether it's a search or whether it's a

21

reasonable search, but if we address our last argument

22

which is that where police have a right to stop a car

23

initially, may they check the car, perform a visual

24

frisk, for purposes of finding out whether there's a

25

gun, I think that's something that the law would support.

there was no legitimate expectation of privacy in the

I would like tc commence my argument by

6
7

responding to as question that was posed both by Justice

8

O'Connor and Justice Stevens before the lunch break, and

9

in doing so we would like to emphasize that it is our

10

contention that the judgment of the New York Court of

11

Appeals was decided on adequate and independent state

12

grounds, both in the New York

13

Article 1, Section 12 which was cited by the Court of

14

Appeals in its decision in this case, in which that

15

Court is used in a whole host of case:; to declare a

substantial independent right against unreasonable

searches and seizures under New York's Constitution, and

18

also under Section 401 of the Vehicl<

and Traffic Law.

In its opinion rendered below, the Court of

Appeals discussed the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law,

21

Section 401, to determine whether in the case cf an

right to search the car for the Vehicle Identification

The Court of Appeals held that Section 401

both the constitutional issues, state and federal, and

the statutory issue, and the mere fact that the Court

independent state grounds.

Officer McNamee conducted an unreasonable search when he

identification number, where Officer McNamee had
absolutely no factual grounds to believe that the car
was stolen.
Officer McNamee never stated the reason why he
wanted to see the VIN.

He never suggested that he had

any belief that the vehicle was stolen, and indeed under
the facts of the case there could have been no such
reasonable belief.
The only thing that Officer McNamee knew when
he plunged into Mr. Class's car was that this- person had
been stopped for driving five to ten miles per hour
above the speed limit and that he had a cracked

11

that one officer’s

13

there has been some kind of communication between the

officers, or a directive, for instance from one police

The intrusion into Mr.

Class's car plainly constituted search under this

Court's decisions,

that if we’re concerned about police safety once the

do is for the police officer to go into the car if he’s

him where it is, and go to that certainly identifiable

place.
Here, this police officer was not engaged in a

Yes.

21

I say this, Justice Rehnquist, because there

is a finding of fact in this case that out from under

inch, was the observable, identifiable gun butt.

don't have to decide the broad issue, if it’s anywhere

in the car, but certainly when it's on the dashboard.

13

Yes, I would suggest that in any case where a VIN

14

number's covered on the dash, and the driver stepped

15

away from the car, it's not necessary for the police

16

under Himms to bring the driver back to the car, to open

17

up the door and step in, and indeed they probably would

have seen the gun at that poin ; anyway.
So, in closing, I'd simply like to say that we
