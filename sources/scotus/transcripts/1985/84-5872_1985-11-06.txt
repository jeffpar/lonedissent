ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN ALLAN SALTZBURG, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

10

We will hear arguments next

MR. SALTZBURG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I must begin by confessing that the facts of this

11

case are much less exciting than the two cases previously

12

heard by the Court.

13

Indeed, the facts are quite simple.

A state prisoner in Virginia, a prisoner in the

14

Richmond City Jail to be exact, filad a suit in Federal District

15

Court alleging that he was injured while he was incarcerated

16

in the Richmond City Jail.

17

he slipped on a pillow which was o i some newspapers on the

18

stairs in the jail.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SALTZBURG:

21

22

And, he alleged specifically that

So, it is a negligence case, is it?
Mr. Chief Justice, it sounds like

a negligence case and both parties have treated it as such.
The facts hardly look like facts that would support

23

a federal action or a case that this Court should spend its

24

time on, but, in fact, this case and these facts really are

25

a messenger of major issue and how the Court decides that
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

issue will be of great importance to everyone incarcerated

2

in any jail or prison in any state in this country.

3

And, that issue, simply put, is whether or not persons

4

who are incarcerated have a right to be cared for, have their

5

persons protected by those who have been entrusted with their

6

safety.

7

8
9

QUESTION:

So, you think you are talking just about

prisons?
MR. SALTZBURG:

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. SALTZBURG:

Justice White, yes.

All right.
Not only yes, but a very important

12

part of our argument will be that the reason why we urge that

13

there was a duty upon the state to provide some kind of compensati on

14

for a prisoner who can prove that he was, in fact, injured

15

while in custody is that is part of the due process of law

16

the person is entitled to when he is incarcerated as a person

17

may be under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.

18

The Court of Appeals sitting en banc decided three

19

questions, all adverse to the Petitioner.

20

five to four vote that this Court's decision in Parratt v.

21

Taylor which had held that a prisoner could bring a suit seeking

22

compensation for a negligent deprivation of property, as long

23

as there was no meaningful state remedy, that Parratt did

24

not apply to liberty interest, did net apply to injuries to

25

the person, and that a prisoner had no right to sue in federal

It decided by a

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

court for injuries to his person even if no state remedy were

2

available.

3

An unanimous

Court of Appeals, nine-zero, held

4

that Parratt — another holding, that the Parratt case ought

5

to apply to liberty and property interests, meaning that even

6

if it were wrong concerning protection of the person, that

7

if a meaningful remedy were available in state court that

8

for this kind of injury a prisoner could not sue in federal

9

court under 1983.

10
11

12

Finally, a six to three split on the court held
that there was a meaningful remedy in state court.
This afternoon I would like to concede at the outset

13

one of the major points decided by the Court of Appeals. We

14

do not quarrel with zhe holding of the Court of Appeals, the

15

nine to nothing holding, which is Parratt applies in cases

16

in which a prisoner is claiming that he was injured as a result

17

of the tortious conduct of a safety officer while in custody

18

and whether that tort is negligence or an intentional tort,

19

not an independent violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

20

But, we concede that the Parratt reasoning ought

21

to apply, if, indeed, a meaningful remedy were available in

22

state court for this Petitioner, this Petitioner ought not

23

to be able to proceed with the Section 1983 action.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Saltzburg, can you explain why you

think the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment were concerned
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

with possible state law negligence actions by state officers?
MR. SALTZBURG:

Yes, Justice O'Connor.

Perhaps

3

I can explain or answer that best this way.

The drafters

4

of the Fourteenth Amendment and of the 1866 and 1871 Civil

5

Rights statutes which enforced the Fourteenth Amendment plainly

6

had in mind, as this Court has noted several times in the

7

legislative history cited in Monroe v. Pape and Mitchum versus

8

Foster, that one of the evils that gave rise to the Fourteenth

9

Amendment and the Civil Rights statutes was the problem of

10

law enforcement officers, sheriffs as well as courts, failing

11

to do what was necessary to protect people in their —

12

QUESTION:

Well, failing to act consciously by reference

13

to the word "deprive," don't we have to look at that word

14

in the clause and inquire whether the ordinary meaning of

15

the word "deprive" means an intentional rather than a unintentiona

16

kind of an act or discrimination?

17

MR. SALTZBURG:

Justice O'Connor, there are two

18

answers that I would like to give you to that.

19

Court has looked at the meaning of the word "deprive" in Parratt

20

v. Taylor and the majority of the Court, in Justice Rehnquist's

21

opinion, said that in the context of a $23.50 hobby kit which

22

had been lost that the prisoner was deprived of liberty within

23

the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. SALTZBURG:

One is the

By a negligent act.

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. SALTZBURG:

3
4

a property case.

But, property, not liberty?
Yes, Justice Blackmun, that was

Ours is a liberty case.

In a moment I will argue liberty deserves as much

5

protection as property.

6

a second answer and I think that before the Court is an argument

7

implicit, I suppose, in this case, but almost explicit, that

8

maybe Parratt ought to be reconsidered. Maybe the Court should

9

take another look.

But, Justice O'Connor, there is also

And, we had anticipated that and briefed

10

it and I intend to argue that too, that even if the Court

11

looks again, that Parratt was indeed correct.

12

The first point that I would — There are three

13

major points I would like to argue and that is, Justice Blackmun,

14

as you said, the fir ;t point is that liberty interests deserve

15

as much protection a-; least as property interests.

16

The second point is that negligent deprivations

17

should be deemed to be within Section j.98 3 when prisoners

18

are in custody and in control of state officers.

19

And, the third point is that there was no meaningful

20

remedy within the meaning of Parratt and the Chief Justice's

21

opinion for the Court in Hudson v. Palmer in Virginia state

22

courts at the time this suit was filed.

23

On the first point, whether liberty interests should

24

be given as much protection as property interests, this

25

argument — the argument I make is the one that I believe
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

finds strong support in virtually everything this Court usually

2

looks at in rendering decisions pn the law, on constitutional

3

law and the meaning of statutes.
The history of the Civil;4Wjhts Statute is a history

4
5

set forth at some length in Monroe versus Pape and Mitchum

6

v. Foster and it is a history of a Congress concerned with

7

the abuse of people.

8
9
10

It is true that property sometimes was damaged when
people were deprived of their rights, but it is a history
that speaks eloquently about people.

11

The language of the Civil Rights Act does not mention
- r*

12

the word "property."

13

the rights protected by the Constitution and laws of the United

14

States.

15

It speaks about interest protected,

Even if the Court somehow were to want to draw a

16

line between liberty and property, as the four dissenting

17

judges said in the court below, surely the person wouxd come

18

out on top in any rational system.

19

line between liberty and property is not only difficult, but

20

it may be unnecessary in most cases.

21

of good time wrongfully, a deprivation of property or liberty.

22

It is the failure to process properly a claim of employment

23

discrimination which this Court has confronted.

24

liberty claim or a property claim?

25

not matter.

And, indeed, drawing the

Our point is it should

8

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Indeed, there is a tragic irony in the argument

2

that was made by the majority of the Court of Appeals, an

3

argument that is repeated by the Respondent in this case.

4

Prior to the Civil War and prior to the Fourteenth Amendment,

5

this Court was called upon to decide whether certain people

6

and classes of people were people or property and the Court

7

said property.

8

and statutes were enacted to correct that decision.

9

A war was fought,an amendment was adopted,

And, now, the Court of Appeals has held that certain

10

people don't even qualify even as property.

11

as much protection.

12

They don't get

In our view, that decision flies in the face of

13

the language of the statute.

14

this Court which has emphasized the history of that statute.

15

It flies in the face of logic and it is wrong as a matter

16

of law.

17
18
19

It ignores the decisions of

That is the easiest point in our view that we have
to make this afternoon.
The second point is the more difficult one.

It

20

is made more difficult by the fact that in the case that follows

21

this, the Solicitor General of the United States will argue

22

to the Court that it should not only reconsider Parratt, but

23

it should reject the holding of Parratt v. Taylor.

24
25

Thus, Justice O'Connor, I won Id like to reach the
question you asked which is was the Court correct when a
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

/
1

majority of the justices in the Parratt case said that, indeed,

2

a negligent deprivation could be a deprivation of property

3

within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, and, therefore,

4

within the reach of Section 1983.

5

It is not our contention that every state tort

6

gives rise to a civil rights action under Section 1983.

7

we to have to argue that, we could not win.

8
9

Were

Indeed, the end of the Parratt opinion contains
a reference to an automobile accident involving a state officer

10

and the same majority that had decided Parratt suggested that

11

surely that alone could not warrant a suit under 1983.

12

The Solicitor General would be right if, in fact,

13

we were asking this Court to say every time there was an injury

14

at the hands of a state officer that there—had to be a remedy,

15

a damage remedy.

16

of sovereign immunity that has been in effect both before

17

and after the Civil. Rights law

18

You would hava to overrule every notion

We ask this and onl} this, that this Court recognize

19

what it said in 1856 in South versus Maryland; that there

20

has been a common-law duty on the part of officers into whose

21

custody prisoners have been placed to protect.

22

have been held responsible in damages.

23

QUESTION:

The officers

Well, that was in the days of Swift against

24

Tyson, wasn't it?

25

have any very direct application today.

I mean South against Maryland really doesn't

10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

MR. SALTZBURG:

No, Justice Rehnquist, you are correct.

2

It was in the days — In a careful look at the opinion, one

3

has difficulty knowing whether the Supreme Court was deciding

4

as a matter of state law or federal common law.

5

also, whether or not it is a statement about the liability

6

of a sheriff was state or federal law.

Fourteenth Amendment position.

In dictum

And, it is a pre-

8

Our position is, however, that the Congress that

9

was responsible for putting forth the Fourteenth Amendment

10

and the Civil Rights law, that that Congress understood that

11

for centuries sheriffs and law enforcement officers were

12

responsible for persons placed in their custody.

13

had to be made —

QUESTION:

A decision

Mr. Saltzburg, can I ask this question

15

that your argument prompts?

Our position though is there is a difference between the guest

And, indeed, that may seem to be an unjust result.

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

and the prisoner in terms of freedom to make a choice, to

2

enter or not enter.

And, the prisoner has no such phoice.

And, Justice Stevens, the argument we make is

3
4

premised on one inescapable fact which is after the Civil

5

War the Reconstruction Congress had some choices it had to

6

make.

7

leave with state courts, how much authority to vest in federal

8

courts, what kinds of protections to give people.

It had to make a decision on how much authority to

■y

9

Now, it is possible —

10

QUESTION:

Are you suggesting, Mr. Saltzburg, that

11

the Fourteenth Amendment — the Due Process of the

12

Fourteenth Amendment imposes more stringent restrictions upon

13

states than the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment

14

does on the federal government?

15

MR. SALTZBURG:

16

QUESTION:

No, Justice Rehnquist, I am not.

Well, then, are you relying on anything

17

other than the Due Process Clause of the

18

here?

19

20
21

22

MR. SALTZBURG:

Due Process Clause plus the Civil

Rights statutes which were enacted.
QUESTION:

Now, let's break that down a minute.

I understood your claim was brought under 1983.

23

MR. SALTZBURG:

24

QUESTION:

25

Fourteenth Amendment

Yes.

And, that the reason that you arc suing

is because 1983 gives you a right to recover for a violation
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

of your constitutional rights. The violation of your constitutiona

2

right was a deprivation of liberty without due process of

3

law.

4

MR. SALTZBURG:

5

QUESTION:

6

Yes.

Well, why did the 1866 and 1871 statutes

have anything to do with it?
MR. SALTZBURG:

7

Well, without those statutes and

8

without a decision like Bivens versus United States, it wouldn't

9

have been clear that a. person could have sued in federal court

10

even if his rights had been violated.
What we ask the Court to look at is the entire body

11
12

of legislation enacted following the Civil War.
QUESTION:

13

But, all that does is get you into court,

14

as I would say, to assert your constitutional claim.

15

doesn't define the limits of your constitution claim.
MR. SALTZBURG:

16
17
18

Rehnquist.

It

We don't quarrel with that, Justice

We agree with that.
QUESTION:

Well, all the talk about Congress knew

19

that keepers of prisoners had duties, how does that fit into

20

your argument?

21

MR. SALTZBURG:

It does tie in, I hope, with the

22

citation of South versus Maryland, which this Court said

23

as a matter of — may have been federal common law.

24

assumption being that, in fact, sheriffs and jailers were

25

responsible and suable for damages when they faixed to protect
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

The

1

persons in their custody.

2

that.

3

was found in the Fifth Amendment and it used the board language,

4

no state shall deprive a person of liberty, property, or life,

5

that the Congress would not have intended to allow the states

6

to escape the responsibility that they previously had in the

7

state officers.

8
9

10

We ask this Court to reason from

And, when Congress used similar language to that which

QUESTION:

Well, would the same liability be here

on a Bevins claim against a federal prison warden in the same
situation here?

11

MR. SALTZBURG:

12

QUESTION:

13

of federal officials, was it?

14

Yes, in the same situation —

But, South against Maryland wasn't speaking

MR. SALTZBURG:

No.

But, I think it is undeniably

15

our contention that some remedy is required for prisoners

16

placed in federal custody and there is a failure to exercise

17

due care to protect them.

18

I would just note if I might in answering that question

19

that it is not at all clear that anything in the Federal Tort

20

Claims Act now would stand in the way of any remedy.

21

kinds of acts we are talking about, as we understand it, are

22

remedial under the Federal Torts Claims Act and the arguments

23

made which I really can't address in this case, but will be

24

addressed in the next case concerning the implications for

j.5

the federal system, I think, are probably exaggerated in the
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

The

1

brief filed by the Solicitor General.
But, it is our argument that a failure to protect

2
3

those people who are incarcerated in the only lawful form

4

of involuntary servitude and incarceration permitted by the

5

Thirteenth Amendment, that part and parcel of the due process

6

that they are entitled to is the protection of their safety.
QUESTION:

7

May I interrupt again?

If I understood

8

you correctly, you said they should not be deprived of the

9

protection they previously had had.

The assumption I was

10

making is that as a matter of Virginia law the sovereign

11

immunity defense protected both the prisoner and the guest

12

before the 1983 was enacted, therefore, the effect of the

13

statute as you construe it would be to give an extra protection

14

to the prisoner that nobody else in the Commonwealth had.
MR. SALTZBURG:

15

Justice Stevens, it is probably

16

the case that the prisoner was protected in the early 1800's

17

under Virginii law and no one else was.

18

by the majority of the Court of Appeals, an 1820's case,

19

suggesting that the sheriff would be liable in a suit by the

20

prisoner.

21

There is a case cited

The current state of Virginia law is probably that

22

no one could recover in state court against the sheriff or

23

the person who committed the tort.

24
25

And, our argument is that part and parcel of due
process when someone is incarcerated is that they be protected
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

2

and they are entitled to a remedy.
On the point of a remedy, I would like to be clear

3

about this, we believe the remedy ought to be a state remedy.

4

We do not argue to this Court — and we use the word "court"

5

that there must be meaningful remedy in a state court.

6

use court in the broadest sense of the term.

7

be an administrative tribunal, it could be a workman's compensa­

8

tion court.

9

phrased was whether there is a meaningful remedy that protects

10

We

The court could

The question we believe that Parratt properly

the prisoner's safety in the hands of state officials.

11

And, the argument we make concerning the duty of

12

the state, we believe, is supported by the language in the

13

Screws case which was a criminal case which did impose an

14

intent requirement and was properly distinguished, we believe,

15

in Parratt.

16

We would also cite —

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Saltzburg, before you go on, when

18

you talk about a meaningful remedy, are you talking about

19

the right to recover or the right to have access to the state

20

court to' present your case and take what defenses may be advanced

21

as they come along?

22

immunity will be played in this case, but I would suppose

23

in many cases the state would elect not to do it.

24
25

I think you are satisfied that sovereign

MR. SALTZBURG:
as follows:

Justice Powell, our position is

That if — The state may have many defenses which
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

do not -- are not inconsistent with the notion of a meaningful

2

remedy.

3

QUESTION:

Such as contributory negligence.

4

MR. SALTZBURG:

Which we concede, contributory

5

negligence being one, the statute of limitations being another.

6

If the prisoner is somehow at fault, fails to comply with

7

the ordinary rules of procedure, we do not say that the state

8

should not be able to close its doors whatever the tribunal.

9

When it comes to sovereign immunity, our claim is

10

merely this:

11

recover against anyone, that is not a meaningful remedy.

12

If the state says you can sue but you cannot

There is a problem in this case and it is a problem

13

I must own up to and that is the prisoner in this case did

14

not file originally a state court action.

15

in federal court and his explanation was he feared the

16

sovereign immunity defense.

17

immunity defense was raised.

18

asked both the Petitioner and Respondent, Petitioner would

19

you go to state court if that defense were waived?

20

was yes.

21

Respondent's position was we believe — even though we claim

22

this defense, we believe this defense is made in good faith

23

and can win in state court, there is still a meaningful remedy.

24

He filed his suit

already before the Court of Appeals.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Saltzburg, you have probably already

3

answered this adequately, but let me ask anyway whether, as

4

far as you are concerned, it is clear that in Virginia the

5

state law is such that a state officer sued in his individual

6

capacity has an absolute defense based on sovereign immunity.

7

You are satisfied that that is the case.

8
9

MR'. SALTZBURG:

Justice O'Connor, you put it slightly

more strongly than I would.

If I can soften it to be as exact

10

as I can, I am satisfied that current state of law in Virginia

11

set forth in our brief, most particularly the Messina case,

12

is that the Virginia Supreme Court has justified sovereign

13

immunity on two grounds, one more recently than the other,

14

both on protecting the public fisc, but more recently on the

15

grounds that it is important to encourage people to be public

16

officers and that, in fact, sheriffs repeatedly assert sovereign

17

immunity defe ise and that there are not many reported decisions

18

because the circuit courts in Virginia —

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SALTZBURG:

When sued in their individual capacities?
Yes.

And, that in this case I believe

21

the record fairly shows, although there is no transcript

22

available for oral argument, that in fact the Respondent wanted

23

to adhere to that in any state court proceeding.

We believe this case ought to be disposed of by
the state.

The most important thing I have to say this
18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1

afternoon is that I do not represent a Petitioner who is asking

2

the federal courts to throw open the doors to a host of suits.

3

The argument that I make on behalf of this Petitioner is that

4

there is protection of the person required under the Fourteenth

5

Amendment that is enforceable by federal civil rights law

6

and if, and only if the state fails to provide protection.

7

QUESTION:

But, shouldn't the word "deprivation"

8

have the same meaning regardless of the context in which the

9

suit arises?

10

MR. SALTZBURG:

Justice O'Connor, the only answer

11

I can make to that is if you accept, and you may not, but

12

if you — If I can persuade you to accept the argument that

13

part of due process when someone is incarcerated — Here is

14

where the state does act intentionally, when it wiLlfully,

15

intentionally, and knowingly says we are going to take away

16

your freedom and your ability to protect yourself.

17

Part of the requirement of due process \s that they

18

supply the protection and in this context when they fail to

19

do that for whatever reason believe that they, in fact, deprive

20

a person of a right.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

Would you say that is an intentional

deprivation?
MR. SALTZBURG:

Justice Rehnquist, I argue especially

24

in our reply brief — I believe that the line between negligence

25

and intention is far more looser than Respondent in this case
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.

1
2

and in the case to follow would have the Court believe.
If I might explain, plainly the state intends to

3

incarcerate, plainly the state intends to have a prisoner

4

do or not do certain things.

5

there is an allegation that the defendant — Respondent intended

6

to harm the Petitioner.

QUESTION:

I do not believe in this case

If your client had been in a federal

prison what would be the situation with exactly the same facts?
MR. SALTZBURG:

It is my understanding, Mr. Chief

Justice, he would sue under the Federal Tort

11

where he would have a claim.

12

You could

MR. SALTZBURG:

It is inconceivable that anyone

would argue, I think, under the Federal Tort Claims Act that

the person who leaves a pillow on the stairs is exercising

20

a discretionary, a judgmental function.

21

22
23

QUESTION:

The function of a prison is a discretionary

function, isn't it, a governmental function?
MR. SALTZBURG:

Certain aspects surely are.

If we did not —

That would be contrary to quite a few

MR. SALTZBURG:

I hope not.

But, if we didn't,

10

if we didn't, and, if, in fact, the simple negligence of a

11

federal prison guard caused injury, perhaps death, to a federal

12

prisoner and if it were held that the Federal Tort Claims

QUESTION:

Mr. Saltzburg, a moment ago in answering

17

you are not asking to have the state sovereign immunity declared

MR. SALTZBURG:

QUESTION:

No, sir, it does not.

May I ask you if you would characterize

10

your due process claim in this case as a procedural due process

11

claim or a substantive due process claim?

12

MR. SALTZBURG:

I think the proper characterization

13

of it, Justice Stevens — and I hesitate before answering —

14

is more in the nature of substantive due process dispite by

15

hesitancy in light of the attack made by the Solicitor General

16

in the next case.

17

I hesitate but I do not back away from

QUESTION:

19

MR. SALTZBURG:

I think that is the thrust of your argument.
It is our contention that the Solicitor

20

General must prevail, must, if the only way our Petitioner

21

could win the case is for the Court to hold that every state

22

tort is a 1983 tort.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Saltzburg, if the Court were to hold

24

that negligent infliction of harm to a prisoner by a state

defense?

3

Is inadvertence always a

Would it ever be a defense?
MR. SALTZBURG:

How do you handle it?

Justice O'Connor, we conceded that

4

a qualified immunity, such as this Court has already held

5

under 1983, is adequate.

6

state in its own tort system, if adequate for federal purposes,

7

it certainly would not be a denial of a meaningful remedy.

8

And, we think that takes care of a lot of the problems of

9

anticipating decisions, the failure to anticipate decisions

10

before they are announced.

11
12

It would clearly, if applied by

QUESTION:

So, it could always be a defense in state

law?

13

MR. SALTZBURG:

Yes.

And, in fact, if that were

14

the only defense, both a state tort claim and a 1983 suit

15

in state court could be brought together and the same defense

16

would apply to both.

17

May I reserve the remaining tine for rebuttal?

18

QUESTION:

Negligence would — There wouldn't be

19

many occasions where the defense would apply in the negligence

20

section.

21

MR. SALTZBURG:

Justice white, very few — The cases

22

where it does apply are cases in which after the Court clearly

23

announces a decision such as you must do this to conform to

24

the due process clause, someone doesn't know about it but

25

should have known.

That is probably the only case.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES WALTER HOPPER, ESQ.

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

Mr. Hopper?

MR. HOPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

6

This is a garden variety slip and fall case, a common

7

law tort.

8

to a prisoner.

9

negligence of a deputy sheriff leaving a pillow and some news­

10

It occurred in a jail and it caused bodily injury
It was said to have occurred due to the simple

papers on the stairs used by the prisoner.

11

We wish today to address by way of argument.two

12

points.

13

by a deputy sheriff causing unintended bodily injury should

14

not constitute a deprivation of liberty in the constitutional

15

sense.

16

Our first point is that an act of simple negligence

Our second point is that even if an act of simple

17

negligence constitutes a deprivation i.i the constitutional

18

sense, a state law defense such as the defense of sovereign

19

immunity, does not violate due process when it operates to

20

preclude recovery.

21

We believe that the Petitioner here has assumed

22

that as a prisoner his interest in freedom from personal .injury

23

is a liberty interest that is protected by the Due Process

24

Clause and we believe that this assumption of his is based

25

largely upon the fact of his incarceration.

As a result ^

/—

1

his incarceration, he believes that a special duty is owed

2

to him to keep him absolutely free of tortious injury.
He argues that an act of simple negligence by a

3
4

deputy sheriff in this case constitutes a deprivation of this

5

liberty interest and he argues that there is, in fact, an

6

absolute state defense of sovereign immunity such that no

7

state recovery would be allowed, therefore, he has concluded

8

that this deprivation has occurred without due process of

9

law.

10

We submit that if the Petitioner's basic argument

11

is accepted, almost any negligent tort that is committed by

12

a guard or a deputy sheriff, depending on the availability

13

of a state tort remedy, could be considered a deprivation

14

of a liberty interest without cue process of law.

15

For example, if a prrson guard or a deputy sheriff

16

could have an automobile accident resulting from his simple

17

negligence when he is taking a prisoner to or from court for

18

a hearing, if an injury has occurred to that prisoner and

19

there is no adequate state remedy, then it can be said that

20

a deprivation of a liberty interest has occurred in that set

21

of facts.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

May I ask whether there is an adequate

state remedy in your hypothetical?
MR. HOPPER:

Justice Stevens, I am assuming in the

hypothetical I just proposed that there would not be a state
25

remedy.
QUESTION:

You are just assuming it for the

3

hypothetical.

4

I mean, in most of these cases, is there or is there not a

5

sovereign immunity defense is what I am trying to figure out.

6

You know what the law is in Virginia though?

MR. HOPPER:

Justice Stevens, with respect, the

7

law in Virginia is not clear as to this particular, unique

8

government official, a deputy sheriff, and it is subject to

9

constant review by the courts of record in the Commonwealth.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. HOPPER:

What did the Court of Appeals say?
Justice White, the Court of Appeals

12

said that they thought that sovereign immunity defense had

13

no part in this case.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. HOPPER:

16

QUESTION:

17
18
19

20
21

And, it was not available

in Virginia.

And that it was not avctilable.
Why shouldn't we take that as the law

of Virginia?
MR. HOPPER:

With respect, Justice White, the case

relied on by the Fourth Circuit was an 1826 case.
QUESTION:

Well, you suggest we should just say

the Court of Appeals didn't understand Virginia law.

22

MR. HOPPER:

23

QUESTION:

Yes.

24

QUESTION:

Aren't they more likely to understand

25

With respect, Justice White, yes.

Virginia law than we are?

Several of them are Virginia lawyers,
26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

aren't they?
MR. HOPPER:

2

With respect, Justice Rehnquist, they

3

ought to.

4

however.

5

again, they relied on an 1826 case.

6

not recognized by the Virginia Supreme Court until 1839, it

7

was not then further developed until 1849.

8

case that the Fourth Circuit has relied upon, I would submit,

I do not agree with their conclusion in this case,

within the Commonwealth of Virginia.

11

QUESTION:

So, sovereign immunity in Virginia now

12

exists only to the extent it has been declared and it has

13

never been declared with respect to a prison guard.

MR. HOPPER:

15

Petitioner urges —

16

QUESTION:

17

I would suggest the inference is the

Court of appeals was quite correct then.

18
19

Justice White, that is correct.

MR. HOPPER:

Respectfully, Justice White, I do not

agree with the Court of Appeals.

20

QUESTION:

I know, but what — They have said we

21

never had sovereign immunity until now and now we are going

22

to have it here, there, but they have never said about this

23

case.

24

MR. HOPPER:

25

QUESTION:

That is correct.
They have never touched on this case.
27

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

2

MR. HOPPER:

That is correct, Justice White.

The

highest court of the Commonwealth of Virginia has not spoken.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. HOPPER:

How about the lower courts?
There are numerous circuit courts of

5

the Commonwealth of Virginia, Justice White, which deal with

6

this issue.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. HOPPER:

9

And say that there is sovereign immunity.
Justice White, with respect, they are

divided and the reason they are divided is because the court

10

of record in the Commonwealth of Virginia engages in a

11

determination of whether the act being performed is discretionary

12

or ministerial.

13

The Petition in this case, however, urges that a

14

special duty is owed to prisoners because they are in the

15

complete control of the state and he argues here perhaps that

16

the prisoner had no choice but to go down the stairs upon

17

which he fell.

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Hopper, let me interrupt you and

19

get back for a moment — I fear I may be confused.

Then how do you differ from the Court

of Appeals with respect to the adequacy of the Virginia remedy?
MR. HOPPER:

6

I do not, Justice Rehnquist, differ

7

with the Court of Appeals on the adequacy of the Virginia

8

remedy.

9

sovereign immunity applies to this particular officer.

10

11

I differ only with the Court of Appeals on whether

You would say that it was an adequate

remedy even though sovereign immunity is available.

12

MR. HOPPER:

Justice White, yes, it would be my —
I know, but that certainly isn't the

14

thrust of the Court of Appeals.

15

MR. HOPPER:

16

Again, referring to the example that Justice Stevens

I understand that, Justice White.

17

alluded to earlier, where is the difference if an individual

18

comes to the very same jail where this Petitioner was housed

19

and he had to go see the Petitioner on a cold and icy day

21

of steps to it.

case is the status of the individuals.

7

theory, one must conclude that the visitor would have no remedy,

either in the federal or the state courts because of the operation

of sovereign immunity.

10

11

QUESTION:

MR. HOPPER:

QUESTION:

15

MR. HOPPER:

17
18

Justice Marshall, that is what the

Petitioner has just said, yes, sir.

14

16

As I understand the difference is that

he was a voluntary visitor.

12
13

Yet, under Petitioner's

No, sir.

The visitor would be a voluntary

Yes, but the prisoner wouldn't be.

is the difference.

19

MR. HOPPER:

20

That is what he says.

Justice Marshall, that is correct.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. HOPPER:

23

Petitioner argues that the Due Process Clause though

That is the difference.
That is correct.

24

is not violated the moment that the tortious injury occurs.

25

He says that his now may be a substantive due process claim.
30

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

Yet he has said in his petition that the due process rights

2

are not violated until there is no state remedy available

3

to him.

4

Yet surely I think we would all have to agree that

5

this injury could not have been inflicted by the deputy sheriff

6

on the Petitioner even if a pre-deprivation hearing were held,

7

simply because no process would ever justify inflicting an

8

injury on anyone's person.

9
10

The fact of the hearing or the lack thereof does
not affect this injury.

11

Petitioner's basic position, we believe then, is

12

really that his loss should net go without compensation.

13

In essence, he argues for the best of all possible worlds.

14

Unfortunately, in Virginia, it is not the best of all possible

15

worlds.

16

but other official immunity defenses such as prosecutorial,

17

judicial, witness, parole board, legislative immunities.

18

Therefore, citizens in the Commonwealth of Virginia may be

19

injured by the actions of governmental officials but do not

20

always have a tort remedy available to them against either

21

the official or the government which he represents in Virginia.

22

There are not only the sovereign immunity defense,

As I mentioned earlier, sovereign immunity was not

23

recognized in Virginia until 1839.

Hinchey versus Ogden represents the other end of the extreme

where the plaintiff lost a leg and part of her buttocks.

13

In both of these cases, however, the plaintiff was without

14

any remedy in state law at all because of the operation of

13

MR. HOPPER:

Justice Stevens, intellectually it

should not be different.
However, as Justice O'Connor has pointed out, the

16

word "deprived" is found in both Section 1983 and the Due

17

Process Clause and we bolieve that in the due process sense,

18

the Due Process Clause, it should be limited to the deliberate

19

actions of state officials which are designed to take away

20

those constitutional interests, simply because historically

21

the guarantee of due process has been applied only to the deliberai

22

decisions of government to consciously take away life, liberty,

23

or property.

Surely it is our position that the framers of the

Doesn't that

afford a basis for a difference in the two?

11

MR. HOPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, logically it may,

12

but Monroe versus Pape was dealing with that same type of

13

situation where, I believe, the argument was that those officers

14

were acting outside the scope of their authority.

15

the purposes of state action, it was held that they were within

16

the scope of their authority.

17

But, for

The suggestion that you make in the due process

18

sense may well provide a bright line or a clear division to

19

view a "deprivation" in the constitutional sense.

20

If we may now turn to our second point, that is even

21

if an act of simple negligence by a deputy sheriff constitutes

22

a deprivation in the constitutional sense, then the sovereign

23

immunity defense does not violate due process when it precludes

24

recovery.

25

On this point, we have some difficulty speaking
36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

on behalf of the Commonwealth as to her rationale for not

2

providing an opportunity to this plaintiff to receive money

3

damages simply because of the status of the deputy sheriff.

4

He is neither a state employee nor is he a government employee,

5

he is simply a deputy — a constitutional officer under the

6

Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Code.

7

is funded by a formula of both state and local funds.

8
9

10

His position

The Virginia Tort Claims Act does not apply to him,
nor is he afforded representation by the state Attorney General's
office.

11

Similarly, the municipality does not exercise any

12

control over him and he is not offered representation by the

13

city attorney's office.

14

On the other hand, if he were a local government

15

employee, he would be not covered by the Tort Claims Act,

16

however, he would be extended sovereign immunity for simple

17

acts of negligence while performing discretionary functions.

18

As I mentioned earlier, the deputy sheriff in Virginia

19

occupies an unique position as a public official in Virginia's

20

scheme of government.

21

Several of the courts of the Commonwealth, the courts

22

of record, have extended to him the defense of sovereign immunity

23

for acts of simple negligence while performing discretionary

24

functions.

25

On the other hand, he has also been denied such
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

a defense by several of the other courts of the Commonwealth

2

depending on what the court considers to be a discretionary

3

function.
Here, the Petitioner maintains that the sovereign

4
5

immunity defense is absolute and that it will bar any action

6

brought in the state court.

7

created a system of civil compensation for tort victims.

8

In this case, however, the state does not provide him with

9

compensation for his particular injury.

He argues that the state has

10

He says without an opportunity to be heard on the

11

merits of his claim in state court, he has been deprived of

12

his liberty without due process of law.

13

In the best of all possible worlds, the Petitioner's

14

loss probably should not go without compensatior.

15

should the Respondent prevail in the state court.: on the defense

16

of sovereign immunity, he will not receive compensation for

17

his injury.

18

QUESTION:

However,

Mr. Hopper, tell me once more what your

19

position here is about the availability of sovereign immunity

20

in the event the Petitioner were to bring his case in Virginia.

21

The Court of Appeals said that there would be no sovereign

22

immunity.

23

Your position is what?
MR. HOPPER:

My position, Justice Rehnquist, is

24

that there would be sovereign immunity because this individual

25

was performing discretionary acts and an act of alleged simple
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

negligence is alleged against him while performing those dis­

2

cretionary acts.
QUESTION:

act, not cleaning the stairwell?

And, what precisely is the discretionary

MR. HOPPER:

That is correct, Justice Blackmun,

not taking the pillow or the newspapers from the stairway.

7

QUESTION:

8

(Laughter)

9

MR. HOPPER:

I am going to remember that at home.

It has never been the law, we believe,

10

that a state violates due process whenever it makes available

11

substantive or procedural rules of tort law which on occasion

12

preclude individuals from obtaining relief for certain injuries

13

caused by state actors.

14

The states have been permitted to erect reasonable,

15

procedural requirements for triggering the right of adjudication

16

such as statutes of limitations and filing fees.

17

1^. is only —

18

QUESTION:

May I give you one other hypothetical

19

that occurs to me as a result of Justice Rehnquist's question.

20

Supposing your sovereign immunity doctrine were much clearer

21

than it is.

22

waived sovereign immunity in all cases except when a prisoner

23

litigates.

24

don't like suits by prisoners, they are mostly harassing,

25

you know, they waste a lot of time.

You had a black and white rule, the state has

Would you think that would stand up, because we

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

MR. HOPPER:

1

Justice Stevens, in answer to your

2

question, I think that we would have to determine whether

3

that decision was wholly arbitrary or irrational.
QUESTION:

4
5

It surely wouldn't be wholly irrational.

It would save the Commonwealth a lot of money.
MR. HOPPER:

6

We would have to weigh then a balancing,

7

if you will, of the private interest against the public interest

8

and the public interest of maintaining orderly administration

9

of its jails and prisons may very well outweigh the interest

10

of the prisoner to bring a suit in the courts of the

11

Commonwealth and receive compensation for that.

12
13

I cannot give you a blanket answer because I think
that it would depend —

14

QUESTION:

It would clearly prevail on your — If

15

your first argument is right, you would still definitely win

16

because it doesn't come in.

17

second argument would treat that kind of case.

18

MR. HOPPER:

I am just wondering how your

The second argument being a balancing

19

of the governmental interest, Justice Stevens in your hypothet­

20

ical?

21

QUESTION:

Well, your argument, as I understand

22

it, is, first, there is no deprivation of liberty because

23

it is a negligence case.

24

what the sovereign immunity situation is.

25

If you win on that, you win no matter

Your second argument is that in all events there
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

has been no deprivation of due process because he has the

2

same rights as other citizens and sovereign immunity is just

3

something all citizens have to confront.

4

what if all citizens don't have to confront it, just prisoners,

5

then I am just wondering whether you would still say there

6

was no denial of due process.

7

MR. HOPPER:

Then I am saying

Justice Stevens, I would come down

8

on the side that there would be no denial of due process

9

assuming that there was a wholly rational and not arbitrary

10

reason for that.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. HOPPER:

13
14

Reason for that.
And, the legislature would make that

determination at some point in its deliberations.
In the recent case, however, of Messina versus Burden,

15

the Virginia Supreme Court has stated that sovereign immunity

16

serves a multitude of government interest in this case and

17

these include not only those that Petitioner alluded to earlier,

18

which was protecting the public purse, but a number of others,

19

among which were eliminating public inconvenience and danger

20

that might spring from officials being fearful to act, assuring

21

that citizens would be willing to take public jobs and also

22

preventing citizens from improperly influencing the conduct

23

of governmental affairs through threat or the use of vexatious

24

litigations.

Zj

The Virginia court has also noted that government
41
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

can only function through servants such as this deputy sheriff

2

and that certain of those servants much enjoy the same immunity

3

in the performance of those discretionary functions as the

4

government enjoys.

5

Given the continued validity of the sovereign immunity

6

doctrine in Virginia, the Virginia Supreme Court has acknowledged

7

that it must continue to engage in a very difficult task of

8

deciding which government employees are entitled to immunity

9

based on the nature of their acts, either discretionary or

10

ministerial, on a case-by-case basis.

11

believe, reflects what Virginia considers to be some of the

12

important purposes of the immunity defense which benefits

13

society as a whole in Virginia.

14

Such rationale, we

The balince of state and private interests favors

15

the government's interest in this sense and it is rashly related

16

to a legitimate state interest, that of jail or prison adminis­

17

tration in this particular instance.

18

It has been held that immunity rules do not in and

19

of themselves deny due process.

20

do not deny process simply by limiting the state remedy available

21

to this Petitioner.

22

We believe that such rules

We believe that to agree with Petitioner that his

23

procedural due process rights have been violated by the immunity

24

defense would result in common law torts becoming Section

25

1983 cases in the federal courts.
42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

The constitutional question then is whether state

2

procedures, includign sovereign immunity defenses, provide

3

the Petitioner with the process required under the Due Process

4

Clause.

5

We urge this Court to conclude that Virginia's pro­

6

cedures in this case do, in fact, comply with the Due Process

7

Clause.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN ALLAN SALTZBURG, ESQ.

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

14

MR. SALTZBURG:

Mr. Chief Justice, yes.

I would like to answer a question

15

Justice White posed with respect to the opinion of the Court

16

of Appeals with respect to state sovereign immunity.

17

It is true, Justice White, that a majority of six

18

of the Court of Appeals expressed the view that there were

19

several Virginia Supreme Court cases which would suggest that

20

there wouldn't be sovereign immunity.

21

22
23

It is also true that Respondent's position was and
is that there is sovereign immunity in this case.
An assistant attorney general, arguing companion

24

cases which were argued together with this and questions were

25

put, indicated that he supported the view there was sovereign

Well, Justice White, we believe —

It might have been a professor from the

MR. SALTZBURG:

Surely the Attorney General of Virginia

10

is — and I didn't want this to be missed — that it is not

11

a meaningful remedy in a suit where in a state like Virginia

12

in order to litigate this this prisoner would have had to

13

go to state court, might never have gotten a final resolution.

MR. SALTZBURG:

That is correct, Justice Rehnquist,

22

but it did not exist at this time and there was no right of

23

review for this prisoner.

24
25

And, the question we put to this Court is whether
it is truly a meaningful remedy when the Petitioner judges
44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

that the sovereign inununity defense is likely to succeed,

2

the Respondent believes it will succeed, his counsel believes

3

it will succeed, he so represents to the court —

4

QUESTION:

And then it does, and then it does succeed

5

in the state court, so it hasn't been a meaningful remedy,

6

then you are around the mulberry bush again.

7

MR. SALTZBURG:

Yes, Justice White, maybe.

we will lose.

Our position is that is

If that is meaningful, then

The last point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the Martinez

19

for 1983 purposes.

they were rational.

were being transported and had an automobile accident as a

result of his negligence.

deputy sheriff was transporting your client in this case down

11

to federal court to testify in a case and did have an automobile

accident and was charged with negligence.

position would be the same, would it?

as identical to being in jail?

MR. SALTZBURG:

Yes.
Our position is in that specific

fact situation, yes, he should be able to sue under 1983.

20

It would be possible, however, for the court to say that where

21

a prisoner avails himself of benefits that are not imposed

22

upon him, for example, educational benefits and certain medical

23

benefits, that he knowingly chooses to avail himself of that
