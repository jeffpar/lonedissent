As a result of that error, the court was led

7

to authorize a factfinder to speculate that pricing

from the kind of vigorous pricing competition fostered

defendants which their government ordered them and said

22

Now, these two errors not only call for

reversal in this case but established a dangerous

precedent that this Court should deal with.

I would like to deal first with the inference

of conspiracy question.

19

that a factfinder could infer from the record in

the Japanese market could he dumped into the United

the

plaintiffs should be able to produce some evidence that

2

there was a purpose to predation; that ultimately those

3

who paid the price of predation could recover their

4

predatory losses through monopoly profits at some

5

foreseeable point where it made some sense.

6

They should also have some evidence that those

smaller Japanese competitors, those who had

shares of the United States market, had a mechanism to

is entirely tc the contrary.

Thus, the undisputed facts of this case show

that the pricing activities of the defendants in the

activities in the United States.

(202) 628-9300

1

What really happened here is that when it came

2

to the critical, Your Honor , when it came tc the

3

critical question of what was happening in the United

4

States market, whether the; activities in the United

5

States market showed the signs of conspiracy, the court

6

of appeals said it did not have to follow this Court's

7

inference standards for that purpose.

8

9

The court of appeals said that the fact that
it saw some evidence of some collusion in Japan and that

10

it saw the Japanese companies engaging in their

11

government's export program, which would have had a

12

natural tendency to hold up prices in the United States,

13

not drive them down, hut since it saw some collusion

14

someplace, it said all it had to do then as far as the

15

critical question of what was going on in the United

16

States market is see some "circumstantial evidence

17

having some tendency to suggest that other kinds of

18

conduct of concert of action may have occurred."

19

And that's at page 165a of the record, and

20

there the court, in deciding the critical question of

21

whether the activities in the United States were

22

beneficial to American consumers or were injurious,

23

collusive activities, said we look at it in

24

possibilities, not what flows naturally and logically

25

from the record, as this Court required in Cities

(202) 628-9300

terms of

Service

2

And to ®ake that point unmistakably clear, the

3

court expressly said that a line of Third Circuit cases

4

based on Cities Service did not apply and

5

did not have to follow the usual rules of the

6

inference-drawing process.

7

QUESTIONt

that the court

Let me just — You focus our

8

attention on that page.

The court says direct evidence

of some kinds of concert of action like price fixing in

10

Japan may he circumstancial evidence of a broader

11

conspirac y.

12
13
14

Do you agree or disagree with that statement
of law?
MR. ZOELLERi

Your Honor, under some

15

circumstances they might be, but on the record of this

16

case there’s no basis to suggest that they were.

17

in other words, what the court was really saying, and

18

it's the point T addressed earlier, that the pricing

19

activities in the Japanese market were designed to

20

create profits that could be then poured into the United

21

States market to assume losses.

22

Then,

That is a design of predatory intent, but on

23

this record with 20 years having gone by and no

24

opportunity to recoup and no possibility of a rational

25

inference that recoupment could take place in the near

future, such an. inference would not be appropriate.

2

the relationship was not shown in this case.

So,

3

Those activities did not constitute

4

circumstantial evidence of a U.S. pricing conspiracy in

5

this case.

6

looked at it from the standpoint of the United States

7

market, the proof of the putting is that by the

8

plaintiffs* own theory, for 20 unbroken years all of the

9

pricing activities of the Japanese defendants in the

The proof of the putting, if the court had

10

American market were beneficial to American consumers,

11

because it is the plaintiffs' contention that those

12

prices were always low; that they brought down pricing

13

competition in the United States market.

14

But at the end of the period the two American

15

market leaders are still the American market leaders

16

with no loss of market share and no basis for a rational

17

suggestion that that condition would change at any time

18

in the foreseeable future.

19

On the basis of that, to suggest predatory

20

conspiracy when you see none of its footprints in the

21

United States market we say is a wrong reading of the

22

law of inference and a dangerous standpoint, because new

23

the United States antitrust laws are used by those who

24

wish to protect themselves from competition as a way of

25

blocking competition.

QUESTION*

Hr. Zoeller, do you think the

2

Cities Service case laid down a rule of inference

3

drawing through summary judgment that's peculiar to

4

antitrust law, or does it apply across the hoard in

5

summary judgment?

6

HE. ZOELLER;

Well, I would

say, Your Honor,

7

it is not peculiar.

8

inference drawing, but it does have cognizance, I

9

believe, of another principle as well and that is, in

Tt applies basic the principles cf

10

addition to the fact that it's wrong and inappropriate

11

to draw an inference of — to draw an inference unless

12

that inference flows naturally and logically from the

13

facts before you, it is also dangerous, and

14

Cities Service case recognized it, from the standpoint

15

of antitrust policy to take conduct that could either be

16

competition or could possibly be conspiracy and, treat it

17

as conspiracy because, as this Court warned in Honsantc,

18

there is a danger of intruding on normal competitive

19

activity.

20
21
22

I think the

So, I think both policies coalesce in that
case.
QUESTION*

Well, to that extent then, if you

23

just had an ordinary action for fraud and not antitrust,

24

I suppose you would say Cities Service didn't apply

25

because there’s no harm in showing fraud.

HR. ZOELLERs

That sight be possibly so, hut

2

to the extent that Cities Service also says that the

3

inference of conspiracy must be natural and logical,

4

applies.

5

must be rationally explainable in terms of conspiracy

6

than in terms of inference, which is the Cities Service

7

standard as we read it, would not necessarily have to

apply in a fraud case.

But the same broader policy that the record

The court of appeals committed a second

10

fundamental error «hen it failed to apply the sovereign

11

compulsion and active state defenses to the conduct of

12

the Japanese defendants in following their government’s

13

export program.

14

The Japanese government has said in a clear,

15

detailed, explicit and unequivocal statement and in a

16

note verbal that it compelled the conduct in question.

17

That should he recognized for reasons, among others,

18

that the defense is supported in this case by the

19

American government, by the executive branch of this

20

government.

21

program by the Japanese government is a fundamental

22

government program, the control and regulation of its

23

own exports; because it was not designed by the Japanese

24

government to be harmful to the United States but to

25

avoid trade frictions with this country.

It is appropriate because the conduct, the

QUESTION*

Is it logically possible that you

2

could win on the antitrust case and lose on the dumping

3

part of the case?

4

KR . ZOELLER;

In theory it is. Your Honor, but

5

the facts of the case show that there would be no basis

6

tc find a predatory intent as we see it, absent the

7

evidence of conspiracy.

8

there are individual claims —
QUESTION*

9

But as a matter of theory,

Then if the claim of government

10

authorization of whatever conduct is alleged, if that is

11

sustained, it also undermines the dumping case, is that

12

it?

13

HR. ZOELLERi

Not necessarily. Your Honor, in

that sense.

15

therefore it undermines it in the sense that it destroys

the evidence cf predatory intent.

would bar that.

MR. ZOELLER:

I think it should, Your honor,

destroy any evidence of predatory intent under the

MR. ZOELLER:

MR. ZOELLER:

Yes, and we don't see any other

evidence in this record of predatory intent. Your Honor,

18

so that I think the court of appeals relied upon the

19

conspiracy in showing any predatory intent joint or

20

individual, and that is why they dismissed the dumping

21

claims jointly and individually as to the defendant

Sony, for example.

But most of its opinion deals with

Yes, sir.

Judge Becker, though, in

7

deciding the summary judgment motions, in effect

8

assumed, arguendo, that certain evidence was

9

admissible.

Moreover, when you look at the evidence

10

that the court of appeals relied on in reversing Judge

11

Becker, and when you distill it down to its essence,

12

essentially you have four facts that the court of

13

appeals relied on.

14

The respondents have characterized those facts

15

in various ways to make the list look a little broader

16

and bigger, but the fact is there are four facts.

17

because there was direct evidence as to at least two of

18

those facts, the court felt that it didn’t have to apply

19

the rules of inference drawing of Cities Service.

And

However, I think when you look at those four

21

facts, either individually or together, the four facts

22

are not even probative circumstantial evidence of an

23

agreement to charge low prices in the United States that

24

injured the respondents, much less direct evidence of

25

such an agreement* therefore, Cities Services requires

summary judgment
Those four facts are essentially these.

3

First, there was an agreement, let's assume, to

4

stabilize price in a protected Japanese market; that is,

5

the Japanese got together, the petitioners in this case,

6

to fix prices, hold them up at higher levels.

7

protected from competition from foreign parties.

8

that very well have injured Japanese consumers, but no

9

one, including the respondents, would argue that that's

10

They were
Now,

an American antitrust violation.

11

Next, the court relied on Japanese mandated

12

export control arrangements and so-called check price

13

agreements, which fixed the minimum export prices below

14

which the petitioners were not to sell in the United

15

States, and the so-called five company rule, which

16

established that the petitioners could only sell to five

17

customers in the United States, although one of those

18

customers could be their subsidiary who could in turn

19

resell to almost anyone in. this country.

20

If these agreements were effective at all, and

21

I think that even respondents recognize that they were

22

less effective than the Japanese would have liked, the

23

effect of those agreements was simply to keep prices

24

higher in the United States to, in effect, reduce the

25

competitive vigor of Japanese manufacturers in this

market, and while that may he objectionable under the

2

antitrust laws, it certainly doesn't create the sort of

3

antitrust violation that the respondents have alleged,

4

in that indeed they must prove to establish injury that

5

they are entitled to claim under the antitrust laws.

6

Moreover, as we pointed out in cur brief --

Right, which was part of that

15

program, and those agreements were also compelled, in

16

effect, by the government of Japan as it's indicated

17

twice to the court.

18

The third fact is the secret rebates that were

19

not disclosed by petitioners.

20

petitioners engaged in, so the court said, mere than 25

21

different rebating schemes that resulted in prices

22

varying from the very lowest tc the very highest.

23

In effect, the

and sell at the lowest price possible.

The final fact was the allegations that the

3

petitioners sold at dumping prices in the United

States.

6

7

price stabilization agreement.; therefore, prices were

artificially high.

Again, the petitioners dispute that.

Even
You had a

10

inevitable that prices would be lower in the United

11

States than Japan.

12

It's

It simply proves nothing.

Taken together, the inference is overwhelming

13

that the evidence is indicative of individual

14

competitors responding unilaterally and vigorously to

15

market forces; in effect, their new entrance, the

16

petitioners, through the relevant time, trying to make a

17

place in the market by competing on the basis of price,

18

trying to develop customer loyalty, that sort of thing.

19

Kow, that may have injured the respondents,

20

but that's competition, and competition is what the

21

antitrust laws are designed to promote, not to thwart.

22

We believe that the Third Circuit's decision

23

offers strong encouragement, if it's upheld, to

24

beleguered competitors seeking protection from the

25

vigors of competition, and we think that's precisely the

In fact, the court below tested the

Thus, the court of

13

been relieved from filing their final pretrial statement

Now, petitioners argue that the concept, of

sovereign compulsion insulates them from liability for

3

the wrongful acts done in the United States which

4

restraied the interstate and foreign commerce of the

5

United States.

6

is a false issue belatedly raised and is based on an

7

obvious misinterpretation of what the court of appeals

8

said and did.

9

This,

with great respect for my friends,

The Solicitor General, in his brief,

10

acknowledges and concedes that sovereign compulsion is

11

an affirmative defense, yet it was not raised by

12

petitioners in their answers to the complaints with the

exception of hFLKO, which posed it in the context of

questioning subject matter jurisdiction.
But both the district court and

15

the court cf

holdings are not questioned in this Court.

4

simply did not do what they say the Ministry of

International Trade and Industry in Japan directed them

to do.

7

And that is unquestionably the fact, because

8

KITI did not direct the petitioners to dump or to lie to

9

the U.S. Customs on the thousands of entry documents

10

about their prices in the United States, or to lie to

11

the U.S. Treasury about their prices in their responses

12

to the government proceedings and to the Antidumping Act

13

of 1921, or to sell their products in the United

Moreover, there simply cannot be compulsion

18

since, under the very Japanese export and import

act on which my friends rely, petitioners had the right

to withdraw from the very agreements that are here in

evidence, which right to withdraw could not, under the

Japanese statute, be unduly restricted.

MR. ROME;

Yes, sir.

The reason being, Mr.

Justice Rehnquist, is that the entire evidentiary record

19

has to be looked at as an entirety without

fragmentation, and what we were charging here is a

21

conspiracy in restraint of trade and a conspiracy to

monopolize which manifested itself in dumping in the

9

HR. RONE*

No, sir.

That is a completely

10

contention advanced by my friends, because in actuality

course of conduct, then indeed it must be considered as

20

the court of appeals held below.

21

QUESTION*

Well,

but supposing your evidence

22

of what happened in this country shows nothing more than

that these people constantly lowered their prices and

become the only people and the only suppliers in the

result of collusion.

there was indeed collusion in the Japanese market.

law, and then what happened here in the United States

was not just the minimum prices that are referred to in

QUESTION*

May I ask this question?

2

MR . POME;

Sir?

3

QUESTION*

Did I understand your competitor to

4

say that your clients had not lost share of market over

5

the past 15 to 20 years?

6

ME. ROME;

He did

so say, sir.

He did so say,

7

but in actuality it is demonstrated on this record that

8

the pricing in the United States has been woefully under

9

-- the pricing by the petitioners has been woefully

10

under the prices charged by other competitors in the

11

United Sta tes .

12
13

QUESTION;

But my question was whether or not

your clients have lost share of market?

14

MR. ROME;

We have maintained a degree brought

15

but not have been able to go out of separate losses

16

because the prices at which

17

have been sufficiently depressed.

18
19

QUESTION;

You maintain the market share by

cutting your prices to beat the predatory prices?

20

MR. ROME;

Yes, sir.

21

QUESTION;

That's your position?

22

MR. ROME;

Yes, sir.

23

QUESTION;

Did the court of appeals expressly

MR. ROME;

I have no recollection, sir, that

24
25

find that?

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

there was any specific reference to the position of the

2

respective market shares of the respondents here.

3

It should be noted with regard to the 1975

4

statement from the Ministry of International Trade and

5

Industry on which my friends rely that that statement

6

was sent five years after the SUE complaint was filed,

7

eight months after the Zenith complaint was filed, and

8

long after petitioners had filed their answers to the

9

complaint, without raising the affirmative defense of

10
11

sovereign compulsion.
That KITI statement is unsigned.

It purports

12

to refer to an alleged direction given 13 years before,

13

without saying by whom or to whom it was given, whether

14

it was oral or in writing.

15

whatever to the right on the part of the petitioners to

16

withdraw or to their right of appeal, nor is there any

17

statement from Japan’s highest legal officer stating the

18

consequences under Japanese law.

It makes no reference

19

And the MTTI statement —

20

QUESTION;

21
22

Do you think, that there has to be

some fact finding with respect to that statement, or net?
MR. ROME;

No, sir.

What I’m attempting to

23

suggest is that the issue of sovereign compulsion is not

24

properly in our respectful submission before the Court

25

because, number one, even if it be assumed that KITI
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

mandated or directed the petitioners to do something,

2

they did not do what MITI directed them to do, as I've

3

attempted to suggest.

4

And I'm attempting now to turn my attention,

5

if I may, sir, to the diplomatic communications which

6

have come from the Japanese Embassy, because the MITI

7

statement itself makes no reference to the right to

8

withdraw, and the communication from the embassy of

9

Japan when first transmitted in 1975 made no reference,

10

11

however, to that.
But in 1984, six months after the court of

12

appeals had handed down its decision, then there is

13

aaain a transmittal of the same 1975 MITI statement by

14

the Japanese embassy, and then a parenthetical reference

15

which seeks tc import into the 1975 statement a

16

reference to the five company rule which is not there in

17

the original statement.

18

We say, therefore, that those diplomatic

19

communications do not meet the normal criteria

20

recognized to give effectiveness to a diplomatic

21

communication, in that they were neither timely nor

22

sufficient specific.

23

New, what happened then is that in addition to

24

sovereign compulsion, which

25

there is indeed the further point that even if there had

we say is a false issue,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

been a mandate by “•ITI of what they did under the

2

decisions of this Court going back 80 years, that would

3

not prevent that conduct being admissible in evidence

4

and being a part of the overall course of conduct which

5

is capable of being shown to violate our laws, because

6

80 years ago this Court said nc conduct has such an

7

absolute privilege as to justify all possible schemes of

8

which it may be a part.

9

The most innocent and constitutionally

10

protected facts may be made a step in a criminal plot,

11

and it is -- if it is a step in a plot, neither its

12

innocence nor the Constitution is sufficient to prevent

13

the punishment of the plot by law.

14

Our contention, therefore, is that if

15

constitutionally protected conduct, speech, may become a

16

part in a scheme which violates the law and fcrce ycur

about

the position advanced by the brief of the Solicitor

21

General that although the government prosecuted these

22

23

Antidumping Act, ultimately

25

government ever raised the defense of sovereign

inconsistently against the respondents pursuing their

private rights of action against the same petitioners

for the same course of conduct.

5

government in its brief now argues

It is suggested by the Solicitor General's

6

brief that sovereign compulsion should not be available

7

in the action brought by the U.S. government, but that

8

it should be limited in its applicability to suits by

9

private litigants.

This novel contention, we suggest,

10

is unprecedented, and runs afoul not only of the long

11

recognition by this Court that the private litigant has

12

been a bulwark of the enforcement of the antitrust laws,

13

but also of the specific grant by the Congress of

14

private rights of action.

15

If there is to be a change in that law, it

16

should be legislated by the Congress, we respectfully

17

suggest, not in response to a rather casual reference in

18

an amicus brief.

19

But in similar fashion, petitioners'

20

formulation of the conspiracy issue in terms of alleged

21

parallel acts and other ciccumstantial evidence is again

22

a false issue in our view and a misstatement cf what the

23

circuit court said and did.

24

said that this is not simply a parallel action case, nor

25

is it one based on circumstantial evidence alone.

On the contrary,

the circuit court carefully

2

distinguished the line of cases based on conscious

3

parallelism from this case,

4

which there is both iirect evidence of certain kinds of

5

concert of action and circumstantial evidence which

6

suggests certain other kinds of concert of action.

which presents a record in

at the D.S. market and carefully coordinated concealed

12

Whereas, Cities Service mad? a conclusive

13

showing on its part, in actuality what happened here

14

below was that there was no showing by the petitioners

15

at all, because as I have said they were relieved on

16

their own application by the district court cf any

17

obligation to file their final pretrial statement.

18

Hr. Justice Karshall, in Cities Service, said

19

the question whether summary judgment is appropriate in

any case is one to be decided upon the particular facts

21

of that case.

24

reliance upon the inapposite facts of Cities Service.

25

argue that the direct evidence of their collusive

2

conduct in Japan relates to a different conspiracy from

3

the one alleged by the respondents.

4

They seek, thereby, to impermissibly fragment

5

their unitary course of conduct, the single conspiracy

6

that we have charged,

7

to argue that what they did in Japan is ncnactionable.

8

The reason why they say it is nonactionable is because

9

of the alleged mandate from MITI, which I have attempted

into two separate conspiracies and

10

to refer to in my argument about sovereign compulsion.

11

Whatever MITI directed the petitioners to do

12

lost its exempt character when it became part of

2

supports even the contrary inferences — even though

3

contrary inferences might reasonably be drawn.

4

Nor was it permissible for the district court

5

to attempt, as it did, to decide which reasonable

6

inferences are the more probable, because as has been

7

said in Tennant, cited again in Continental Ore, it is

8

not the function of the court to search the record for

9

conflicting circumstantial evidence nor to take the case

10

away from the jury on a theory that the proof gives

11

equal support to inconsistent and uncertain inferences.

12

Petitioners have not really challenged,

13

because they cannot challenge our statement of the

14

procedural history of this case and the careful detailed

15

reference to the factual record.

16

arguments of lawyers cannot prevail over the particular

17

facts of this case established by evidence held to be

18

admissible, which evidentiary rulings are not subject of

19

attack here before Your Honors, and when it is all

20

examined together without fragmenting, we saw that it

21

reasonably tends to prove that petitioners had a

conscious commitment to a common scheme designed to

achieve an unlawful objective, and therefore the court

below should be affirmed.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD J. ZOELLER, ESQ.,

MR. ZOELLER;

If I was able, successfully, to pick my way

Just a minute or two. Your Honor.

8

and I did agree on one thing, and that is that the Third

9

Circuit did not follow the teachings of the Cities

10

Service case, and they had good reason not to.
The record would not support a rational,

12

logical inference that a conspiracy to establish

13

predatory low prices in the United States ever existed.

14

Indeed, this is an unusual case where the record

15

directly rebuts it.

16

That is perhaps the reason, also,

why Mr.

17

Rome, now having spent an additional half hour, has

18

never touched on the question of what the record of the

19

activities of these companies in the United States

20

market was; hasn’t discussed their pricing activities;

21

disavows any intention to show that there was

22

recoupment; shows no way that those activities could be

23

distinguished from the competition beneficial to

24

consumers which the antitrust laws are seeking to

25

foster, not tc squelch.

illogical to assume that a group of companies would

hope of ever getting that back out of those activities,
