ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENISE ANTON, ESQ.,

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

MS. ANTONt

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

please the Court, this case involves the question of hew

11

the pretrial motion exclusion of the speedy trial action

12

be applied.

13

Subsection

14

the defendant m’ust be tried under the Speedy Trial Act,

15

delay resulting from pretrial motions, the statutory

16

language reads "delay resulting from any pretrial motion

17

from the filing of the motion to the conclusion of the

18

hearing on or other prompt disposition of such motion."

19

This exclusion of Section 3161(h)(1)(f),
(f ), excludes from the 70-day period in which

The deceptively narrow issue presented in this

20

case is what is the scope of this exclusion.

21

exclude only reasonable deLay?

22

delay?

23

end?

24

without addressing and resolving the issue of whether

25

the Speedy Trial Act is going to have the effect of

Does it

Does it exclude all

And at what point does the automatic exclusion
This narrow question cannot be answered, however,

3

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

expediting criminal cases that Congress clearly intended
when it passed this legislation.
Congress passed the Speedy Trial Act because
i

it was dissatisfied with the way that courts were
interpreting the Sixth Amendment.

It was dissatisfied

with the way that the participants to the criminal
justice system were processing their criminal cases, so
it passed legislation which it certainly intended would
have some sort of an effect on the status quo which
would require the parties to move at a pace at which
they were not moving.
How this Court interprets the pretrial motion
exclusion will determine whether Congress was at all
successful in its efforts.

This particular case is an

excellent vehicle for considering this question since it
involves a delay of over 789 days from the point
superseding indictment until the defendants were
ultimately brought to trial.
This is not a case where we are talking about
one or two days of delay that are at issue.

Depending

on how the Court interprets the pretrial motion
exclusion, literally hundreds of days will either become
automatically excludable or nonexcludable as far as the
Speedy Trial Act computations.
But the true issue involved in this case
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

really transcends the facts of this particular case,

2

because it is clear that the pretrial motion section of

3

the Speedy Trial Act lies at the very heart of the

4

Speedy Trial Act.

5

comes to court is going to involve filing some pretrial

6

motions, and how this Court interprets this section will

7

resolve how all these cases will be processed, virtually

8

every criminal case in the federal courts.

9

is presented with —

10

Virtually every criminal case that

QUESTION;

This Court

Ms. Anton, may I ask you whether

11

you would agree that the legislative history of this

12

thing suggests that Congress thought the circuits

13

themselves would police the requirements under these

14

rules to provide some guidance to trial courts to set

15

times within which the motion should be resolved rather

16

than to think that Congress itself was imposing an

17

overall time limit?

18

MS. ANTONs

I have no dispute with the

19

government or the Ninth Circuit in this case that

20

Congress intended that local guidelines be developed.

21

do not agree that Congress intended that the viability,

22

the effectiveness of the Act would rest solely with the

23

development of local guidelines. •

24
25

If that were the case, I don't believe they
would have had any need to enact this legislation since
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I

1

Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure at

2

least provided that local guidelines should be adopted

3

for the prompt disposition of criminal cases.

4

If Congress believed that the local guidelines

5

were effective and were addressing the problem that it

6

perceived, it would not have enacted this legislation.

7

QUESTIONS

Hell, in your view, just exactly

8

when did the prehearing delay in this case become

9

unreasonable?
MS. ANTONs

10

This case presents numerous

11

examples, I think, of the kind of excessive delay that

12

should not occur in a criminal case.
QUESTIONS

13

Hell, can you pinpoint a single

14

time when you think it is clear that the time became

15

unreasonable and the government should have known at

16

that time?

17

MS. ANTONs

I think that the clearest example,

18

the most illustrative situation is the delay that

19

occurred in this case following the hearing cn the

20

pretrial motions.

21

this case on March 25th, 1981.

22

The pretrial motions*were held in

That was approximately four months after the

23

first motion was filed.

Regardless of whether the

24

period of delay from the filing of the motion until the

25

hearing was considered reasonable, the period cf time

that was exclude! by the Ninth Circuit under Subsection

2

(f) following the hearing was, I believe, totally

3

unreasonable .

4

QUESTION*

You say it was unreasonable.

One

5

gets the impression from reading the briefs and

6

opinions of the Ninth Circuit that at the conclusion of

7

the hearing in the District Court the District Court was

8

allowing the record to remain open because there were

9

further factual submissions to be made.

10

HS • ANTONs

the

Kell, the governmnent — we differ

11

as far as how many really -- hew many issues really

12

remained unresolved.

13

remained unresolved was the issue of whether defendant's

14

request for an evidentiary hearing should be granted.

15

That motion was filed in November of 1980.

16

The one that is clear that

The government responded to that motion in

17

February of 1981, and basically said, regardless of what

18

the defendants have argued — it was a motion claiming

19

that there were misstatements in a search warrant

20

affidavit — the government's attitude was,

21

of whether these statements are true or net, we don't

22

believe that a hearing is required.

23

regardless

For the first time at the hearing on £arch

24

25th, another month and a half later, the court — the

25

government stated, well, we have changed our mind about
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

how wg want to respond to this motion, and I would like

2

an opportunity to obtain information which will show

3

that in fact there were no misstatements in the

4

affidavit.

5

I think that that is unreasonable that she

6

raised that issue at that late date.

7

fact should have raised it at that date, she said at the

8

time of the March 25th hearing that she believed that

9

she would have the information by the end of the week.

10

Whether she in

She in fact waited three months before

11

providing the information, and she never stated her --

12

she never asked for more time, she never stated that

13

there was some reason why more time was necessary, and

14

the court made no attempt to monitor this situation.
i

15

Our position is that what should have occurred

16

at that hearing if it was reasonable to give the

17

prosecutor any more time at all.

18

do not think, that that was reasonable,

19

should have said that additional time is necessary, how

20

much time do you think you need, and the prosecutor

21

would have said, I think I need ten days, or I need two

22

weeks, and the court would have said, fine,

23

you this two-week period of time, and you will respond

24

within that period of time, and if you don't respond,

25

tell me why, or I will proceed and rule on the motions

In any event, which we
is that the court

I will grant

(202) 628-9300

1

based on the reply that you filed two months ago.

2

I think that what should happen, especially at

3

the point of a hearing, is that any delay occurring

4

after the hearing should be justified under the ends of

5

justice exclusion, continuance exclusion that is found

6

within the Speedy Trial Act.

7

analysis to that that this Court took in the Eojas

8

Contraras case, the recent Speedy Trial Act case that

9

this Court considered.

10

QUESTIONS

I think this is a similar

Of course, it doesn’t really fit in

11

under the continuance section, does it, I mean, the sort

12

of delay attending the hearing and disposition of the

motion.

No, I think that it probably

would.

17

additional information which would resolve

It would be in the interest of justice to allow

18

QUESTION*

the hearing.

Well, you know, in drafting the

19

statute, I certainly think you could make that argument,

20

and perhaps it would be very persuasive, but just the

21

way this statute is drafted, it seems like the ends of

22

justice is limited to your continuance of trial

23

situation.

24

MS. ANTON*

25

read the Eojas Contraras case.

Well,

that isn’t how I exactly
In that case this Court

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

held that the 30-day preparation period during which the

2

defendat cannot be brought to trial does not begin anew

3

with the filing of the new superseding indictment.

4

Court found that this does not mean that more time might'

5

not be necessary because of the filing of the new

6

indictment, and the Court explicitly suggested that the

7

courts, that the trial courts or the parties resort to

8

the ends of justice continuance if it needed more time.

9

QUESTIONS

The

But that again is continuance in

10

the traditional sense of the word that Rojas Ccntraras

11

referred to,

12

set trial date?

wasn't it, the continuance of a previously

J!S. ANTON*

13

Well, it would be a similar

14

situation, I think, under the pretrial — our opinion,

15

to begin with, to step back a little bit, in cur

16

opinion, the language of the Subsection (f)

17

could not be plainer.

that the pretrial motion exclusion ends when there is a

19

hearing conducted on pretrial motions, at the conclusion

20

of the hearing on pretrial motions.

Ns. Anton, how many times did you

22

try to get this case moving by form of a motion of any

kind?

the record that indicates that the defendants made a

Don’t you think you had some

8

QUESTION*

It is a

Well, have you ever heard of one

sleeping on one’s rights?

9

MS. ANTON*

Well,

there is no question but

10

that the defendants in this case wanted the court and

11

wanted the prosecutor — the motions were essential to

12

this case.

13

parties to take them seriously, and if the parties were

14

in fact considering the motions, if they were pondering

15

difficult legal issues —

16

There is no question.

ALDERSON .REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

This is a situation where the court and the prosecutor

2

failed to do certain things that they not only have an

3

obligation to do but which they said they wculd do, and

4

the defendant in a criminal case certainly has enough

5

responsibility in defending against the charges that he

6

should not also take on the responsibility of monitoring

7

the court and the prosecutor.
It is' not a situation where the defendants

8
9

just failed to file the information.

This is a

10

situation where the government waited three months, when

11

it said it would have information within a week, and

12

just practically speaking,

13

responsibility of moving his case along, of requiring

14

the judge to monitor the cases, of trying to control the

15

judge’s calendar, I don’t think that is a responsibility

16

of the defendant, and I den *t think it should be the

17

responsibility of the defendant.

for the defendant to bear the

18

And as I said, I think that the defendants

19

wanted the court to consider the motions, and if the

20

court were considering the motions, the defendant had no

21

desire to cut that short.

22

until the court issued its order ten months later that

23

it was not using that time to consider the motions at

24

all.

25

finally filed was the one issue that was fully submitted

In fact, it was not apparent

The only issue he addressed in his order that he

at the time of the hearing.

2

issue that the court ,— that the prosecutor wanted to

3

present additional information on.

4

QUESTION*

He never addressed the

Can you give me a little help?

The

5

period of dispute, as I understand, is primarily the

6

period after the hearing on March 25th, 1981, and I

7

gather the government argues the motion really wasn't

8

submitted until, I think it is December 15th of *81,

9

because there were a number of filings that took place.

10

Is it your view that after March 25th,

1981,

11

say there was a clear understanding that the government

12

filed something more in 15 days, and they did file it

13

within

14

under your view?

15

15 days.

Mould that

MS. ANTON*

15 days be excludable cr net

In our view, the pretrial motion,

16

the automatic exclusion for pretrial motions ends at the

17

time of the hearing.

18

QUESTION*

19

MS. ANTON*

Of the hearing, right.
If the court had said,

if it were

20

apparent from the record

21

reasonably necessary, and it was apparent from the

22

record that a specific period of time was being set --

23

QUESTION*

that additional time was

Say you both wanted to file written

24

submissions to make it easy, and they filed something in

25

writing concerning,

15 or 20 days after the first argument said , T will new

2

submit it.

3

wasn’t concluded until those additional filings were

4

made?

Would you not agree that the hearing really

MS. ANTDM*

5

No, but I would agree that what

6

had happened would be sufficient to create a

7

continuance, an enis of justice continuance, so that it

8

would be excludable under that situation.
/

9

QUESTION*

Would the judge have tc make a

10

special finding in your view that we need an extra 15,

20 days for papers to be filed, therefore I will make a

12

finding that the ends of justice will be served?

I think that is how the Speedy

Trial Act should work.
QUESTION*

I think that implicit —

It may be pertinent to whether the case should

this is also true because the Speedy Trial Act was

was passed to protect society's rights, and certainly

the protection of society's right to a criminal trial

I am not saying that is a reason.

I am saying as a practical matter it is very difficult

to tell the judge that he does not believe

If he is in fact considering the motion, there

10

is no reason why the delay should not be excludable.

11

But we find that regardless of whether the court

12

determines that the pretrial motion ends at the time of

13

the hearing, there is a reasonableness standard that

14

must be applied both before the time of the hearing and

15

after the time of the hearing, and that reasonableness

standard is not found solely in the purpose of the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROGER CLEGG, ESQ.,

16

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

17

MR. CLEGG;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

18

may it please the Court, this case involves the meaning

19

of a particular section of the Speedy Trial Act.

20

determining the meaning of a statute, the courts have

21

always looked first to its plain language, which

22

petitioners hardly mentioned today, and they have also

23

considered its legislative history and whether a given

24

interpretation will make the statute unworkable.

25

In

The point that I want to make today is that
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

whichever of these three guideposts are looked to,

2

lanuage, legislative history, or practical effect on the

3

statutory goal, the same conclusion should be reached.

4

The petitioners* trial and convictions met the

5

requirements of the Act.

6

should therefore be affirmed.

7

The Court of Appeals' decision

The time period specifically in question here

8

is from November 3rd,

The United States contends that all of this time is

1980,

through September 14,

1981.

10

excludable under the Act.

11

inability to respond to Justice O'Connor's question,

12

petitioners do not specify exactly how much of it they

13

think is excludable, but they do argue that enough of it

14

was nonexcludable that the Act was violated .

As we have seen by their

15

The time period in question is divisible into

16

two parts, the part from November 3rd, when petitioners

17

filed their first pretrial motion, until March 25th,

18

when the judge hall a hearing on their motion, and the

19

part after March 25th.

20

Petitioners argue that some unspecified amount

21

of time before the March 25th hearing was not reasonably

22

necessary for holding a hearing.

23

to be arguing in their brief that once the hearing was

24

held,

again, even though the trial judge had requested

I had understood them

the Speedy Trial Act automatically started ticking

under advisement.

3

not yet taken the motion

Today, though, it appears that petitioners

4

believe there is a reasonable necessity requirement in

5

the post-March 25 period as well.

6

Without going into all the motions and

7

continuances filed in the disputed period,

8

any fair reading of the record makes clear two things.

9

The first is that there ware a lot of claims that

10

petitioners wanted resolved as a pretrial matter.

11'

they said, they considered this very important to the

12

case.

13

I think that

As

Second, as Justice Marshall has pointed cut,

14

petitioners were in

15

resolved.

16

I make these two points not because they somehow estop

17

petitioner's claim of a Speedy Trial Act violation, but

18

they should be kept in mind because they illustrate a

19

common occurrence.

20

no hurry to have their claims

They pursued them zealously and thoroughly.

Defendants, particularly in cases involving

21

drugs or other contraband, will typically raise a let cf

22

pretrial issues, and want to have them seriously and

23

carefully considered by the trial judge.

24

say that in many cases resolution of these issues

25

decides the case.

It would

not be unusual for the claims to be at least as

4

point, because, as I hope to discuss more later, the

5

construction of the Speedy Trial Act petitioners urge

will make the Act unworkable, will encourage trial

judges to give these pretrial motions short shrift, and

will necessitate constant appellate second-guessing of

This court rule approach makes the most sense,

Courts and prosecutors have to be able

Second, the retrospective nature cf this

standard ensures that there will be a great deal of

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

the appellate litigation that has already been spawned

2

in those circuits which have adopted this standard.

3

And -third,

the standard that petitioners urge

4

will encourage courts to give short shrift to pretrial

5

motions.

6

also leads to a bad result, because judges will be

7

discouraged from asking for post-hearing material, and

8

prosecutors will be discouraged from offering it.

9

Ironically, this is all probably going to do more damage

In this regard, their post-Karch 25 argument

10

to defendants than to the prosecution, but the whole

11

system will really suffer.

12

The reversals that will result, as I said

13

before, will not result in speedier trials, either.

14

Petitioners* response to all this, which you

15

have heard today, is a superficial argument that amounts

16

to saying that since their interpretation will panic and

17

confuse everyone into moving precipitously, that that

18

will speed up trials, and that that will further the

19

spirit of the Speedy Trial Act.

20

Congress did not intend to sacrifice

21

everything for speed.

of the Act best serves prosectors, defendants, and

reasonably necessary.

3

The judge goes off and plays golf between the filing of

motions and the hairing.
MR. CLEGG*

5

Then what?

Then this happens.

The whole point of the court rules

6

is to make precise what these deadlines are supposed to

7

be.

8

what — the kind of court rules that Congress endorsed

9

in the legislative history are ones like the judicial

In other words, what a court rule should have, and

In that case —

NR. CLEGG;

That's right.

If the local rule

16

is violated, then the petitioners have the same recourse

17

that they would have whenever a local rule is violated.

18

And, of course, if it resulted in a Speedy Trial Act

violation, then they would

May I ask

you one question to be

22

sure I understand your reading of the statute?

23

your view that the period between the hearing when the

arguments took place on March 25th of '81 and I think it

25

is December 15th, '81, when the final paper was filed,

Is it

and the judge took it under submission, that we should

treat the period right up to December 15th,

—

That is the time

(f).

But you io it by treating

8

post-hearing submissions as though they were actually a

9

continuation of the hearing itself.

10

MB. CLEGG*

That’s correct, and again,

I think

11

that the legislative history and the structure of the

12

Act with respect to Subsection

13

idea was that here again, this is also something

14

the Second Circuit judicial council had adopted, that

15

the clock is stopped until — once a pretrial motion is

16

filed until the judge gets everything that he needs to

17

rule on that motion.

20

QUESTION*

Then, may I ask, is it correct that

21

the case really boils down to the question whether the

22

word "prompt" in Subsection

position but also, as your opponent contends, modifies

alternatively argue that the time was reasonable, but

2

the basic issue we have to decide is that.

3

correct?

4

MR. GLEGGi

Is that

Hell, I think that that

5

oversimplifies it somewhat.

6

briefly as I can, but it is going to require a little —

7

I think first of all we have to divide the time period

8

here into two parts.

9

when we have the hearing, and then there is the part

10

Let me answer that as

QUESTION»

That's what I don't understand.

If

12

you agree that tha hearing really didn't conclude until

13

December 15th, I am not sure why you have to divide the

14

period.

15

That is really what prompted my question.
MR. CLEGGt

Well, I think that the — focusinq

16

on the word "prompt,” first of all, you are correct that

17

— the first point is that it doesn't modify hearing,

18

and that is,

19

I think, consistent with the legislative

He would also say that again you can't look at
even Section (f) in a vacuum.

You need to look at the

(202) 628-9300

1

rest of Section (h) as well, which makes clear, and the

2

legislative history makes clear that the things that are

3

listed in Section (h) are automatic exclusions, as they

4

are referred to in the legislative history.

5

And I think that Section (h)

begins by saying,

6

you know, any period of delay, and I should also point

7

out that "reasonable" appears elsewhere in (h), but not

8

in the" part we are talking about, and the other parts of

9

(h) have absolute limits, which we don’t have here, too.

10

The other result that petitioners* reading of

11

the Act would have would be to have, a very artificial

12

distinction between notions that are decided with

13

hearings and those that are decided on the papers.

I guess the final point that I would make in

terms of just the plain statutory language is that

18

not an exhaustive list, and

something like including in excludable time the time

2

disposition?

3

MR. CLEGG*

Well, this, I think, is also

4

discussed in our brief, around Page 23.

5

that in that situation, too, the effect of the word

6

"prompt” is really to tie in Section (f) and Section

7

(j).

Our position is

By prompt disposition, it means —

QUESTION*

9

SR. CLEGG:

It means 30 days.
That’s right.

That’s right.

That

10

is the end result, that once he has gotten everything,

11

he’s got 30 days, and that that is what prompt

12

disposition refers to.
QUESTION:

13

That surely doesn't mean that if he

14

takes it on brief, it must be resolved within 30 days cf

15

the time the motion is filed.
MR. CLEGG*

16

No, it is 30 days within the time

I suppose within the 30 days,

before the 30 days runs, he could say, I need something
else, or I am going to have a hearing.

11

HR. CLEGG;

12

QUESTION;

Yes, that’s right.
What if at the time all the papers,

13

are submitted to him and he is not going to hold a

14

hearing, he says, I have 15 other motions under

15

advisement right now,

16

away, so he says, I will delay submitting it for 30

17

days, and at the lapse of the 30-day period he says, new

the motion is submitted?

19

HR. CLEGG;

I just can’t get to this one right

I think, yes, he could, but in

20

that situation I think it would be more appropriate to

get an ends of justice continuance under (h).

22
23

violate the Speedy Trial Act if he did that, that the

MR, CLEGGs

Nell,

I think that in order to

avoid violating tha Speedy Trial Art in that situation/

4

he probably would have to state his reasons for not

being able to rule on it within 30 days.

6

In short, the interpretation of the statute

7

urged by the government is borne out by its plain

8

language and the legislative history, and it ensures

9

that the Act will remain workable.

Petitioners*'

construction, on the other hand, is at odds with both

Moreover, their standard will make it very

MS. ANTON*

Right.
There is a period between the
\

12
13

filing of the last memoranda and September.
I think, that the government’s argument that

14

the language is plain on its face and then that prompt

15

does not mean prompt,

16

parties have any obligation to file their papers with

17

any speed, and that hearing does not mean hearing, but

18

the point at which post-hearing memoranda are filed is

19

not a plain interpretation of the language.

and it does not mean that the

20

I think that any ambiguity is being created by

21

the government’s interpretation of the language, and to

22

no ends that I can see.

23

necessary that this broad interpretation be adopted in
