ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAN W. EVERS, ESQ.,

We will hear arguments

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. EVERSs

Mr. Chief Justice Burger, may it

please the Court, this is the case of Millie R. Lee

10

versus Illinois.

11

Lee, who was convicted in the Circuit Court of St. Clair

12

County, Illinois, of the murders of Odessa Harris and

13

Mattie Darden.

14

I represent the petitioner, Millie R.

The issue presented before this Court today is

15

one involving significant rights under the Sixth and

16

Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution of the United

17

States involving the confrontation clause.

18

The specific issue involved in this case is

19

whether those amendments were violated when the trial

20

judge in this case sitting as the trier of fact stated

21

on the record that he was considering the co-defendant's

22

confession against my client, Millie R. Lee, in finding

23

her guilty of the two murders of Odessa Harris and

24

Mattie Darden.

25

The issue arises specifically because in this

1

case in a bench trial the judge noted that he was

2

considering this as substantive evidence.

3

QUESTION;

Was the confession admitted in

4

evidence earlier in the trial?

5

ME. EVERS;

Your Honor, the confession of

6

Edwin Thomas was admitted by the trial court judge

7

earlier, and it was found to be admissible against Edwin

8

Thomas by the trial court judge at that time, yes.

9
10
11

QUESTION;

And Thomas was being tried at the

same time as she was?
ME. EVERS;

And it was a joint trial.

The

i2

petitioner Millie Lee and the co-defendant Edwin Thomas

13

had waived jury trial previously, and the day of trial

14

they came in and waived out a motion to sever the case

15

from each ether, and they agreed that a bench trial

16

would be proper if the judge considered the appropriate

17

evidence only against each defendant.

18

At trial —

19

QUESTION;

20
21

Well, was there any objection to

the admission of the co-defendant's statement?
ME. EVERS;

There was no objection made tc the

22

admission of the statement into evidence except with the

23

understanding that the evidence was to be considered

24

separately.

25

that their motion to sever would be moot or disregarded,

At the beginning of trial when they said

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

it is because they went in on the understanding that the

2

judge would be able to consider the evidence separately

3

against each defendant.

4

The general rule of law, of course, is that

5

the judge can compartmentalize his mind and separate the

6

evidence and consider the evidence separately.

7

why —

8
9

QUESTIONS

Did he say what was in the

co-defendant's confession as it relates to this

10

petitioner would not be considered as to this

11

petitioner?

12

That is

HR. EVERSs

At the very beginning of trial,

13

when they talk about the judge considering the evidence

14

separately, Judge Robin, who was the trial court judge,

15

does state that he would do that, and so this trial

16

began on the basis that the judge would separate the

17

evidence and consider the admissible evidence only

18

against each cc-defendant.

19

QUESTIONS

And did he say later that

20

nevertheless he was now going to consider it against

21

this petitioner?

22 j

HR. EVERS*

When he finds my client, Millie

23

Lee, guilty at the end of the presentation of the

24

evidence and at the end of arguments by counsel, the

25

trial court judge states in his finding of guilt that
5

(202) 628-9300

1

the petitioner is guilty as charged, and he states, I

2

reject — basically he says, I reject her defense

3

because her argument is that she was not guilty of the

4

murder of Odessa Harris because she had no intent to

5

kill, did not plan to kill,

6

Thomas was going to kill Odessa Harris, and

7

second defense was that the killing of Hattie Darden

8

would be voluntary manslaughter.

9

and did not know that Edwin
that her

The trial court judge says, I reject that

10

because whether there is a plan to kill is disputed by

11

the co-defendant's confession.

12

confession clearly shows that there was premeditation,

13

and than he also says that he rejects voluntary

14

manslaughter because the co-defendant *s confession says

15

that Edwin Thomas had asked her to go in and take care

16

of Hattie Darden.

17
18
19

QUESTION!

The co-defendant’s

petitioner ?
HR. EVERS;

Asked the petitioner.

The general

20

basic facts of the confession by the co-defendant Edwin

21

Thomas and the statement by Hillie Lee is, there is a

22

great difference.

I would argue that there is no

Harris caught him, and he h ad to wrestle he r to the

11

floor, and stabbed her in t he chest or stom ach area,

12

There is a great difference.

The problem is

13

in this case Edwin Thomas's confession says that they

14

had talked for months about the problem wit h Mattie

15

Darden, and that they had t alked about the need to ki]1

16

Mattie Darden, and that tha t night they t al ked about it

17

and talked about the need t o kill Odessa Ha rris.

18
19

There is no such admissions, ther e are no such
statements in Millie Lee’s statem ent.

I am not sure how that could
All I know is that there was no

objection at that time during trial.
QUESTION*

11

Do you suppose that the failure to

12

object was on the grounds that there was no point in

13

calling more attention to it and that it didn't make any

14

difference in the long run given the totality of the

15

eviden :e?

NR. EVERSi

I do not believe that that would

be a good assumption in this case.
QUESTION!

Do „ou suggest that the evidence

19

was n.'t strong, the evidence of guilt was net strong

20

independent of this evidence?

21

MR. EVEKSs

I believe that the evidence of

22

guilt is closely balanced, and is not clearly showing

23

that she had — that the state proved her guilty beyond

24

a reasonable doubt of the murder of Odessa Harris.

reaching for something more solid than a number of

inferences from the petitioner’s statement.

think that the trial court attorney, the attorney for

MR. EVERS*

possible. Justice White, since she, counsel had filed a

motion to sever when the jury trial was still a

25

possibility, and in that motion to sever she alleges

that prejudice would occur if trial would be conducted

2

with the co-defenant, and the major reason why prejudice

3

would occur is because of ro-iefeniant*s confession.

QUESTIONS

How in the world can I assume that

5

a lawyer didn’t hear something that was said in open

court?

anything in the record that would give you the slighest

idea?

How in the world can you assume that?

How can you as counsel assume that

From the record, I can only state

that the attorney either did not hear it cr was not

manslaughter was also a possibility as a verdict due to

the petitioner's statement —

MB. EVERS*

Mr. Evers —
— and if she believed that the

co-defendant's confession was admissible and usable

against Millie Lee,

8

that into the post-trial motion.
QUESTION:

9

then there would be no need to put

Mr. Evers, I didn't want to

10

interrupt you, but I think. I understood you to say at

11

the outset that the trial court had agreed that it would

12

not consider in response to the motion to sever the

13

evidence introduced by one party against the other

14

party.

15

Did the judge say that on the record?
ME. EVERS*

The trial attorneys indicate that

16

the motion is no longer needed to be heard because with

17

a bench trial the judge would consider the evidence

18

separately.

19

The judge says it will je done so.

QUESTION*

So your position is, the j’ dge did

20

agree in advance that he would not consider the evidenc

21

with respect to Thomas in his consideration of whether

22

Lee was guilty or not?

23

MR. EVERS*

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes, Your Honor.
He didn't mention the confession,

so the confession wasn't specifically mentioned,

At the beginning?

Yes.
Millie Lee is mentioned in the

10

So what makes you think — the

judge never said he wouldn’t consider the cc-defendant*s

The point is that they moved, both Edwin

co-defendant's confession.
QUESTION*

3

Mr. Evers, may I go back for a

4

minute to your suggestion that maybe the lawyer didn't

5

hear what the judge was saying?

6

understand it, about the judge announcing his ruling and

7

explaining his reasons for the ruling.

8

ME. EVERS*

9

QUESTION*

We are talking, as I

Yes, Your Honor.
Is it customary in Illinois for a

10

lawyer to interrupt a judge

11

he objects to the ruling as it is being delivered?

It would be possible tc —

18

who is ruling and tell him

MR. EVERS*

It is not customary.
The practice has changed since I

It may be possible to object at

19

that time, but it is net customary, and as far as what

20

was going on, I am not sure, as far as how the courtroom

21

scene was set up.

22

QUESTION*

Isn't the typical way to object to

23

a judge's ruling by filing a post-trial motion?

24

isn't that exactly what was done in this case?

25

do you have to assume that the lawyer didn't hear?

Would it not also be a logical time

when the judge concluded his statement to object then

5

HR. EVERSs

That would also be possible.

would admit that, Your Honor.

MR. EVERS:

QUESTION;

Did it say specifically that the

16

that the co-defendant's confession was not admissible

18

HR. EVETSi

It does talk about the only

19

evidence against Millie Lee is her statement, and that

20

her statement does not indicate an intent to kill.

6

assume that Thomas had been tried

that his confession has been admitted

MB. EVERS*

Would the confession have

No, Your Honor.

Illinois law

7

would make that inadmissible, and from what occurred at

8

trial, if Millie Lee and Edwin Thomas had a jury trial,

9

under Illinois law the judge would have been required to

10

sever the cases so that the confession of Edwin Thomas

11

would not prejudice Millie Lee at the jury trial.

12

What the Court appears to be worried about is

13

whether there is waiver of this constitutional right in

14

this case, and I do not believe that that could be found

15

on this record.

16

objection was made at the time, and to suggest that it

17

was waived would be waiving out a significant,

18

constitutional right, and the Sixth Amendment

19

confrontation clause was not suggested by the State of

20

Illinois in the appellate court below or in this Court,

21

and the general rule in Illinois is that any error made

22

at a bench trial is preserved for appellate review

23

without filing a post-trial motion.

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202 628-9300

1

ME. EVERS;

The appellate court of Illinois

2

did review the merits of this case.

3

of Illinois apparently extended the Plurality opinion

4

written by Justice Rehnquist in Parker versus Randolph

5

to this case stating that this was an interlocking

6

confession case.

7

The appellate court

Parker versus Randolph distinguished Justice

8

Brennan’s opinion in Bruton, and indicated that there

9

was no error in admitting the co-defendant's confession

10

at a joint jury trial, but even in Parker versus

11

Randolph the jury was instructed by jury instructions

12

from the judge that they were not to consider the

13

co-defendant’s confession against each other.

14

In Parker versus Randolph, it was clear that

15

the jury was instructed that the co-defendant’s

16

confession was not to be used against the defendant who

17

it did not involve, so I believe that there is a clear

18

constitutional .iolation here in that the trial judge

19

stated on the record that he was using the

20

co-defendant’s confession and not just a problem of

21

prejudicing the jury by hearing the confession of the

22

cc-defendant and then being instructed to disregard it.

23

If there would be no other questions, Your

24

Honors, I would request that you reverse her convictions

25

of the two murders, remand for a new trial where she

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MRo. WINE-BANKSs

3

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

4

it please the Court, respondent's position,

5

stated, is that there was no constitutional error in

e

this case in the admission and use of the co-defendant’s

7

confession against the defendant, and secondly, that if

8

there was any error, it was harmless.

simply

The tension that has long existed between the

9
10

use of hearsay in a criminal case and the rights of

11

confrontation under the Sixth Amendment can be lessened

12

the trial court judge, what a reasonable trier of fact

indeed there is no — it would be a travesty to reverse

propose a very sensible rule defining what interlocking

because I am willing to concede that in a one-confession

MRS. WINE-BANKS*

Justice Rehnquist, we would

argue that it comas in as a statement against penal

interest, which is reliable enough to meet the test of

10

Roberts, which determines, we believe, when any type of

11

hearsay is admitted.

12

least two courts of appeal have admitted statements

13

against interest by accomplices against the defendant,

14

and have done so under the Roberts test, but they were

other testimonial evidence in addition to being

21

corroborated by the interlock, and are corroborated by

indeed it was the blunt blows to the head that killed

her.

So, the murder occurred after the

self-defense, if ever there was one, and I think that

8

her confession even earlier makes clear there is none,

but certainly there is no doubt about it at that point,

10

would not have a self-defense left at that point.

Yes, Your Honor.

We believe

that is why he is an unavailable witness, but if he

8

hadn't invoked his privilege, then he would have been

9

available for cross examination, and either way, the

10

availability becomes a red herring, because if he had

11

not taken the Fifth Amendment, as was his right, then he

12

would have been available for cross examination, and

13

there would be no confrontation clause problem for this

14

Court to address.

15

It is only because he was unavailable because

16

of the existence of the Fifth Amendment privilege that

17

we have the confrontation question.

18

QUESTION:

Thank you.

19

MRS. WINE-B?NKS:

One of the problems that has

20

occurred in reading the cases is that there is a

21

question about whether a confession is different than

22

other statements against penal interest, and there has

23

been perhaps some argument that there is a presumption

24

against the reliability of such confessions.

25

While even if a rebuttable presumption is
35
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F SI ., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 626-*j00

1

warranted, we think, that the creation as is suggested by

2

this case of an irrebuttable presumption, that that is

3

not required by the Sixth Amendment, nor is it

4

consistent with this Court's rulings or with good public

5

policy.

6

Indeed, a reverse presumption of

7

trustworthiness may even be warranted.

As this Court

8

said in California versus Green and in Watlcck, a

9

confession to murder has its own indicia of

10

reliability.

11

dissent in Donnelly, no other statement is so much

12

against interest as a confession to murder.

13

more calculated to convince than the dying declaration.

14

As Oliver Wendell Holmes said in his

It is far

Because of the reliability of a murder

15

confession, especially when coupled with the

16

corroborative elements such as exist in this case,

17

respondents urge this Court to find under Roberts that

(8

petitioner's co-defendant*s confession had sufficient

19

indicia of reliability to be properly admitted without

20

trial cross examination.

21

Such a holding would be consistent with

22

Roberts and Pointer, California versus Green, Barber and

23

Moates, which all permitted the inculpatory use against

24

a defendant of preliminary hearing testimony where there

25

was cross examination of the declarant, or perhaps even

(202) 628-9300

1

where there was only an opportunity for cross

2

examination is suggested.
It is also consistent with Dutton, wherein the

3
4

Court ruled that a Georgia rule of evidence which

5

permitted a concealment phase conspiracy statement to be

6

admitted without violating the Sixth Amendment, and with

7

Mancusi versus Stubbs-Maddox, which held the admission

8

of a transcript from the first trial to be admissible

9

without violation of the Sixth at the second trial.
The ruling that we urge the Court here to find

is also consistent with the purpose of the Sixth

12

Amendment.

intended to be a Safeguard to ensure the fairness and

practical concern for the accuracy of the truth

18

19

truth of the prior statements.

20

According to Parker, the Sixth Amendment is

According to Dutton, the

Following the decisions and logic of this

21

Court's rulings in Roberts and other cases, we believe

22

that there is a satisfactory basis for evaluating the

23

truth of the underlying statement, and at least two

24

Federal Courts of Appeals have ruled that the admission

25

of an inculpatory statement against penal interest is
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, IN»..
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202, o28-9300

1

admissible against a defendant, and two courts have

2

ruled that a co-conspirator confession statement

3

inculpating the defendant is also admissible.

4

These decisions and the logic and policy

5

underlying them support the result respondents urge

6

before this Court today, which is that the

7

co-defendant's interlocking confession be included with

8

other inculpatory statements against penal interest in

9

the category of reliable and therefore admissible

10

hearsay despite the absence of cross examination at the

11

trial.
Where the courts have found that the

12
13

substantive use of hearsay is permissible against a

14

defendant, the courts have said that although there is a

15

preference for a face to face confrontation as a means

16

of testing the truth of the underlying statement, that

17

right of cross examination may be replaced by other

18

guarantees of trustworthiness.

9

we have already discussed and demonstrated why the

substitute for that, which is that the cross examination

12

would be of sc little value that it is unnecessary, and

the record on that, but as I said, in addition to her

11

own confession, we have all of the evidence in addition

to that.
