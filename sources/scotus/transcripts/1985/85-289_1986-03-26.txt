ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED, ESQ.
4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS
5

MR. FRIED*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

6

may it please the Court.
7

In this case the Civil Aeronautics Board,
8

which at that time was the Government agency charged
9

with the regulation of airline services, issued
10

regulations under Section 504 regarding discrimination
11

against handicapped persons.

It limited those, it

12

limited the reach of those regulations, tc airline
13

subsidized by the Federal Government, subsidized under

-

14

the small communities program.
15

The Court of Appeals invalidated those
16
regulations insofar as they were so limited, and on
17

remand required the Department of Transportation, which
18

is the successor agency to CAB, to extend the reach of
19

those regulations to all commercial air carriers.

It is

20

that invalidation and

that order on remand that we seek

21

to have reversed.
22

In

1979 the Department of Transportation

23

through its component the Federal Aviation
24

Administration issued regulations regarding

4

discrimination against handicapped persons in airport
services, the FAA being the agency charged with and
administering subsidies to airports.

Those regulations

have never been challenged and are not in issue in this
case.

5

6

7

It is worth at the outset identifying what the
underlying policy judgment of Section 504 is.

That

policy judgment is a commitment, I think it’s a moral
8

9

commitment,

that handicapped persons must be allowed the

opportunity to be independent and productive citizens.
10
11

And that means removing barriers of discrimination to
that independence, barriers usually erected by

12

13
14
15
16
17
18
19
20

thoughtlessness and ignorance.
What this case is abcut, why there is a
litigation at all, is because Congress chose to embody
that policy in Section 504, not by legislating to the
full extent of its vary broad powers, for instance under
the commerce clause as it did in Title VII, but rather
Congress chose to limit the reach of its regulations to
those receiving federal moneys and to the programs of
these receiving federal moneys, thereby assuring that

21

22

23
24
25

anyone receiving federal money accept as a condition of
that receipt the obligation not to discriminate against
handicapped persons.
This Congressional choice was by no means
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

casual or unprincipled.

Accepting the obligation to

1

accommodate handicapped persons will not always be easy
2

or costless,

as this Court recognized in the case of

3
4

Alexander and Choate.
It was a rational judgment for Congress when

5

it first ventured into this area to limit the scope of
6

regulation to those who choose to accept moneys from the
7

Federal Government and to impose a condition on that
8

receipt that in the assisted program they must accept
9

the burden of regulation.
10

Now, when Congress has determined to restrain
11

the reach of federal regulation, it behooves the Dnited
12

States to respect that judgment, as we have done in this
13

case, I believe, and net to seek by strained and
14

imaginative arguments to make the regulatory scheme more
15

nearly universal after all.
16

That I think is what is at stake in this
17

case.
18

QUESTIGN<

Mr. Fried, would you mind giving us

19

a bit of explanation about what the position of the
20

Department of Transportation really is?

It sounds like

21

the Department agree! at least in part with the
22

Respondents in that it wanted to apply certain
23

regulations prohibiting discrimination to handicapped
24

people by commercial airlines.
25

12

It was limited to aircraft with

The final regulations in question

carriers.
By executive order, all regulations under

10
11

Justice O'Connor/ the original

Section 504 — and these regulations are issued under
the statutory authority of Section 504 — all
regulations under Section 504 must be cleared and must

13
14
15
16
17
18

be approved by the Department cf Justice.

Therefore,

the expert agency to whom I believe deference is
required in respect to the jurisdictional aspect, if ycu
will, of these regulations is the Department of
Justice.
The Department of Transportation is the expert

19

20
21

22
23
24

agency and the agency deserving deference is respect to
what are the needs of handicapped persons and how those
needs may properly be accommodated.

The Department of

Justice by executive order is the expert agency in
identifying the jurisdictional limits cf Section 504,
and in that --

(202) 628-9300

QUESTION*

Well, is Section 504 the only-

1

section on which the Department of Transportation cculd
2

rely if it wanted to adopt thase regulations?
3

KR. FRIED*

There are two other sections under

4

the Federal Aviation Act.

Section 404(a) and 404(b) are

5

pertinent.

Section 404(a) required simply that all air

6

carriers assure safe and adequate carriage.

Section

7

404(b), which has since lapsed with the sunsetting of
8

the CAB and with airline deregulation, forbade any
9

unfair discrimination.
10

Now, the original regulations which were first
11

promulgated in 1975 when 404(b) was still extant and
12

when it had three more years of life, three or four more
13

years of life before it, would have been ab}.e to use
14

404(b), the unfair discrimination peg, for the extent of
15

those regulations.
16

But 404(b) has lapsed and is no longer
17

available as a predicate for regulation, leaving only
18

404(a), which speaks only to obligations cf safe and
19

adequate carriage.

fcnd these regulations have not

20

sought to have been promulgated and were not promulgated
21

pursuant to that authority.
22

Now, the Court of Appeals and the Respondents
23

call to our attention what they characterize as an
24

anomaly, and that is that handicapped persons are
25

protected in their use of airports and are protected in
their use of a small number cf subsidized carriers# tut
do not get the benefit of federal protection in the
large number of commercial airlines.
He submit that this is not indeed an anomaly

5

6
7

at all.

It is the familiar result whenever legislation

does not go as far as constitutional pcwer wculd allcw
it, whenever Congress seeks to draw a line.

Whenever a

8
9
10
11
12

line is drawn# there will of course be cases on either
side of that line which are quite close to each other.
But that is a fact which this Court# and I
think any mature legal system, is entirely familiar with
ond should not be unduly bemused by.

I don’t think it's

13
14

appropriate to belabor this anomaly# but rather the
appropriate thing to do is to determine in an altogether

15

straightforward way what was Congress’ intent here.
16
17
18

And its intent was tc regulate cnly recipients
of federal financial assistance, and then only the
assisted programs of such recipients.

And our

19
20
21

22
23
24

obligation in the Department of Justice was to
faithfully and in a simple and straightforward way
identify who is the recipient.
And it seamed that the recipient here is quite
easily identified.

It is the subsidized airline, or ip

respect to the regulations not in issue here it is the
25

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

subsidized airport.

Those are the recipients.

There is

1

no great mystery about that.
2

And the identification of the assisted program
3

follows also rather directly and naturally.

It is

4

flying to small communities in the case of subsidized
5

airlines.

It is provision of airport services in the

6

case of the subsidized airports.
7

Sow, the Court —
8

QUESTIONi

Mr. Solicitor General, may I ask a

9

little bit about the nature of the airport subsidy.
10

Does that involve continuing payments for activities
11

that go on in the airports,

or are they like

12

construction grants to build runways and buildings?
13

What exactly is it?
14

MH. FRIED*

They are construction grants to

15

build runways, to build or improve lighting and safety,
16

features having to do with airport operations, and they
17

have on occasion, particularly in the past,

although

18

there are no such grants currently involved, been moneys
19

for the actual construction of airport terminals.
20

QUESTION;

As I understand it, the regulations

21

contemplate some control over activities of lessees and
22

concessionaires in the airport terminals, is that
23

correct?
24

MR. FRIED;

Well, that is a rather complicated

activities as baggage handling, access to ticket

the like.

There are other regulations which were adopted
under Title VI, which are not in issue in this case, and.
which were adapted prior to this Court's decision in
North Haven and therefore of course prior tc this
Court's decision in the Grove City College case,

which

regulations spoke rather broadly and included
restaurants,

included taxi services, included car rental

services, and so on.

My question is, why are they

extended in that way here, whether those would be
valid.

But we don't have that question before us now.
QUESTION*

May I ask about the ticket

handling, for example.

Do they in substance say that a

1

handicapped person must be given non-disc ri minatory
2

treatment in connection with the sale of tickets?

Do

3

they in fact insist then that the ticket give them a
4

ride on an airplane that's just like the non-handicapped
5

person gets?
6

MR. FRIED a

I think that would be the kind of

7

stretch which we very much think going over the
8

jurisdictional lines which Congress drew.

What is meant

9

by discrimination against handicapped persons in the
10

ticketing process is that a handicapped person
11

approaching the ticket counter should be able to
12

-approach the ticket counter, should be able to buy a
13

ticket if one is available on the same basis as anyone

-

14

else.
15

QUESTION*

This is a transaction that the

16

person has with the airline, which is I guess a lessee
17

of the airport, isn't it?
18

MR. FRIED*

The actual transaction of the

19

purchase and sale of the ticket depends — is not
20

covered, no, because after all the ticket -21

in handling baggage for these handicapped people, they
present us with all sorts of problems, we won't do it,

Would

you cut off the money for the airport?
MR. FRIED*

It's quite clear that the airport

is under an obligation that, where there is a covered
airport service, it may not slough off its 504
obligations by contracting those obligations out.

So

for instance, it cannot by leasing the whole airport
building to some third party slough off its obligations
to make that airport —

Yes, that is our contention and

the regulations so provide, because that is a ground

operation.

QUESTION:

Or putting the baggage on the

13

MR. FRIED:

If your question is directed at

14

the seating of passengers,

that is no longer an airport

15

service.

That has something to do with the actual

16
flying of the plane.

We don’t think that flying planes

17

is an airport service, to make the point directly.
18

And seating a passenger is a necessary
19

preliminary part of flying that passenger, and it takes
20

place within the airplane.
21

Now, the boarding gate — if you have an
22

airport which does not have available facilities to
23

allow handicapped persons to reach an airport, that
24

airport is in violation of its 504 obligations, because

at that line which is so troublesome.

QUESTION;

I know, bat which side of the line

1

does this fall?
2

ME. FRIED;

May I — with your leave, may I

3

try to draw the line mere finely.

If you have one of

4

those devices which rolls out of the airport and then
5

kind of attaches onto the airport, onto the airplane, we
6

would submit that that’s an extension cf the bearding
7

gate and.the airport must not, must not not have
8

available that kind of a device so that a handicapped
9

person, should the airline be there to receive him, he
10

should not be able to get to that airline.
11

But once you get to the door of the airplane,
12

the airline takes over, that is correct.

That’s where I

13

would draw the line.
14

QUESTION;

When you say the door,

you mean the

15

bottom of the ramp or the top?
16

17

QUESTIONi

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that’s a

18

case that troubled me, and I would distinguish between

these devices which creep out of the building and attach

onto the plane, and I think these devices are an

extension of the terminal and therefore are covered, and

1

MS. FRIED*

Yes.

2

QUESTION:,

Even if owned by the airline.

3

MR. FRIED*

The one case which I was

4

struggling with and which I would call to your attention
5

is in some of the smaller aircraft, where in fact the
6

boarding stairway is a part of the aircraft itself.

And

7

at that point, I think we have a clear case cf something
8

that would not be covered.
9

Insofar as the boarding facilities are part of
10

the services supplied by the airport, then those
11

boarding facilities would be covered.
12

QUESTION*

The thing that troubles me -- I

13

hate to keep interrupting,

but you say supplied by the

'

14

airport.

But does it in the Government’s view make a

15

difference whether those facilities are leased, owned,
16

leased or owned by the airline, as opposed to being the
17

property of

the airport?

I don’t think it does.

18

MR. FRIED*

I think, Justice Stevens, I think

19

your suggestion is helpful, because the crucial point is
20

not what short of the airplane itself is covered, and
21

that’s where we are bumping up against this line and
22

having difficulty with, but the point that we insist on
23

is, whatever short of the airplane may or may not be
24

covered, one thing is quite clear*

The airplane itself

25
17

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

is not covered
QUESTION*

2
3
4
5

6
7

9
10
11
12

But if the

statute justifies the regulation for airline-owned
equipment that Is used on the airport, why doesn’t it
equally justify the airplane, what happens to the
airplane while it’s taxiing down the runway?

That’s' the

problem.
MR. FRIED*

8

Under the regulations.

Justice Stevens,

the way I would

a

respond to that is that the regulations do net justify
the actual airline operations because the airline is not
a recipient of the assistance.

And whether they do in

fact justify the stairways or this creeping device or
not is a difficult question, and we rather suppose that

13
14

the regulations do include that.
But it’s possible that we are incorrect on

15
16
17
18

that point.

What we wish to insist on is that the

airline — the airplane itself and its flying is not
covered.

Mr. Chief Justice and may it

PARKER, ESQ.,

very clearly to the position of the Respondents in this
case.

Our position is that where the Federal Government

is providing money for the construction of airport
runways, that it is not consistent with Section 504 to
protect a handicapped person from discrimination at a
gift shop located inside the terminal and not protect
that same person from discrimination if she wishes to
hoard an airplane sitting on the runway that is
conducted with federal money.
The Government's position is that only the
most peripheral activities at airports are covered, that
so long as those activities have nothing to do with
people boarding airplanes that they've covered.

That I

think, as your questions suggest, leals to something
other than a bright line, something other than a
bemusing anomaly, but a frustration of the purposes of
Section 504.
That position, we submit, ignores the basic
purposes for which the grants are provided, and it
distorts the decision of this Court in Grove City
20

(202) 628-9300

College versus Bell.
The Court of Appeals below reached its
conclusion that Section 504 had to extend to the landing
and taking off at least of aircraft only after very
careful consideration of the findings made by the Civil
Aeronautics Beard.
significant,

Those findings are still very

even though the substance of the

regulations are not before the Court.
The CAB and the DCT found that there was a
problem of handicapped discrimination by airlines.
There are real rights at stake here.

The issues are not

theoretical ones, but rather they are real ones.
The record below was replete with examples of
actions by airlines which were arbitrary and
inconsistent and which had the effect of denying access,
and certainly causing a great deal of embarrassment and
inconvenience, to any handicapped person who wished to
use a commercial airline.
In response to that, after an extended
rulemaking, the CAB came up with regulations.

Those

regulations are very limited in their scope, and it’s
correct that the substance of those regulations are not
before the Court.
But it’s important to keep in mind what they
did and what they were trying to do.

That was to try to

21

make certain, at a minimum, that the decisions made by
airline personnel in selling tickets, in providing
boarding assistance, in letting people get on the
airplane — the idea was to make sure that those
decisions were based on safety considerations and based
on the actual need, on the factors that were necessary
in order to provide air transportation, to eliminate the
possibility or at least reduce the possibility that
those kinds of decisions would be made based on
irrational assumptions and prejudice.
Basically what the regulations do is to define

11
12

the circumstances under which advance notice can be
required, define the circumstances under which a person

13
14

can be required to have an attendant.
My clients don’t think those regulations are

15

perfect by any means.

They do seem to be a step in the

16
17

right direction, however.
At the same time —

We are not challenging the substance of

It’s interesting that the regulations also

\

of the airplanes at all.

They defer at every step cf

2

the way to safety consideration, both as established by
3

the FAA and by airline personnel.

And none cf the

4

airlines seem to claim, and no one has claimed
5

specifically at least, that these particular regulations
6

would impose any significant burden on the airlines.
7

Nevertheless — I would add to that also that
8

the Department of Transportation seems to agree with
9

that position, that they don’t impose any particular
10

serious burden on airlines.
11

Nevertheless, as the result of this sort of
12

jurisdictional misjnderstan ding between the Civil
13

Aeronautics Beard and the DCT, the regulations do net
14

apply to any major airlines at all.

And as a result of

15

that,

handicapped persons really have no protection if

16

they wish to use airplanes and to fly on commercial
17

airlines.
18

QUESTIONS

Have the commercial airlines

19

continued to this day to conduct themselves in a manner
20

which would be in violation of those proposed
21

regula tions?
22

HR. PARKERt

Justice O’Connor,

the airlines’

23

activity is somewhat unpredictable.

There are certainly

24

airlines that have an excellent record and have not ever

treated handicapped people in any kind of an unfair
way.

Eut one never Knows.
Basically what these regulations did, I think,

3
4
5

6
7

8

and that's the reason airlines seem rather satisfied
with them, was to take the existing practices of the
best airlines and sort of codify them and say these are
acceptable standards and this is what you should be
complying with.
The thrust of our argument here, I think --

9

0
1

2

and again, it goes to the question of drawing that sort
of funny line at the airline.

The thrust of our

argument is that the Government's interpretation of what
"program specificity" means leads to a very odd result.

3
4

It certainly is a hard program to define, and we submit that the Government's program, however they have defined

Mr. Parker,

MR. PARKER*

Absolutely, absolutely.

But then if you do that, and say

12

one of the airlines decides not to comply with the
13

anti-discrimination mandate of the statute, what do you 14

do?

15

uses?
16

How do you enforce it against an airline?
17

MR. PARKER;

There are various remedies that

18

you can impose.

I suppose that in this situation you

19

would not terminate the grant.

You would net tear up

20

the runway, in effect.
21

The Justice Department has the authority, at

The difference is that — the

HR. PARKER*

A private individual who is not

5

Yes, we know.

But maybe the

6

7

8

MR. PARKERt

Well, I certainly agree that it

9

does.

I think the definitional question is helped a

10

little bit by looking at what the Government — what we
11

agree on with the Government.

First, we agree that the

12

airports, as you correctly point out, are a recipient.
13

The airport is undoubtedly a recipient; the airport
14

authority is prevented from discriminating.
15

The airline passenger is, again by the
16

Government’s definition, an ultimate beneficiary.

Where

17

we differ from the Government is where the airlines fit
18

into that.

We say — the Government says that the

19

airlines are no different from their passengers and that
20

they have no obligations to their passengers at all.

12

You couldn't function at all unless

you had the highways.
HR. PARKER»

Well, that's true, that's true.

13
14

But I think there are two factual — two basic
distinctions.

One is that the bus company is going to

15

says I am not, I the bus company, am not in a position
16
17

to truly deny access, because as a matter of fact people
do really — most people really do have cars.

18

Also, I think if I were the bus company I
19

20

would argue that the Government doesn’t have to consult
with me before they can get a — before they can build a

21

22

highway.
think

In ether words, there really is, and I don't

we can ignore it, there really is not just a sort

23

of functional interdependence between airports and
24

airlines, but there is a contractual and statutory

relationship between them that I think is significant,
1

and I think Congress had that in mind.
2

Let me go back, if I could,

to this line cf

3

questioning about what is covered at the airport and
4

what is not.

The Government — because I really would

5

like to emphasize that.

The Government recognizes that

6

the grants for a runway cover — even though the grant
7

is only for a runway, triggers coverage of seme things
8

that go on inside the terminals*

the ticket counter,

9

the baggage claim area, gift shops, and that sort of
10

thing.
11

However, it is quite clear that it does not
12

cover everything that goes on inside the terminal.

The

13

Government's briefs continually try to draw a
14

distinction between in-flight activities and presumably
15

everything else.
16

And I think that the questions that were
17

raised before demonstrate that the Government's line is
18

— I'm not even sure it's arbitrary.

It's very unclear

19

as to what is covered and what is not.
20

It does not cover the sale of a ticket.

It

21

does not cover boarding.

It does not cover whether the

22

airline has to assist a person in boarding or not.

It

23

does not cover wheelchair storage.

All of those things

24

occur well before the person even gets to the gate.

It seems that it is — that it seems inconsistent

activity in that way.
It certainly would seem —

8

QUESTION*

9
10
11

Mr. Parker, may I ask you, what

sort of things are covered at the airport?

Is it things

like structural ramps and access facilities and rest
room facilities and things like that that would be part

12

of the structure itself, as opposed to activities in a
13
14

gift shop?
MR. PARKER*

You mean under the existing

15
16
17
18
19

regulations?
QUESTION*

Under the existing regulations.

For example, what does a gift shop have to do to comply
with the regulations?
MR. PARKER*

The gift shop example comes

20

basically from the Title VI regulations, which the
21

22

Government now seems to be suggesting may not be all
that valid after all, although they've been in existence

23
24

for ten or twelve years.

Longer than that; 20 years.

The gift shop and the restaurant sort of
25
38

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

analogies come out of the Title VI regulations, and
1

presumably that person, the parson in the gift shop,
2

would be required under Title VI obviously not to
3

discriminate cn the basis of race.
4

If the 504 regulations applied to the gift
... 5

'"

shop,* I assume that person would have to comply in seme

6

reasonable way, ani that is — what we’re primarily
7

talking about here, of course —
8

QUESTION*

Did you go through any of these

9

grants ?
10

HR. PARKER*

I’m sorry?

11

QUESTION*

The grants themselves, did you see

12

them, look at them?
13

MR. PARKER*

I have a listing of the grants.

.

14

QUESTION*

I’m wondering if my tax money is

15

being used to construct gift shops.
16

MR. PARKER*

Justice Marshall, I think that in

17

some cases it probably is.

The structure of the statute

18

is initially, the way it was set up and the way under
19

the 1970 statute especially, was to fund activities
20

relating to the landing and taking off of airplanes.
21

That’s runways, taxiways, and that sort of thing.

Under

22

the 1970 statute, you couldn’t use any of the money -23

QUESTION*

That would also include a bar?

24

MR. PARKER*

A bar?

Do you need that for an airplane?

MR. PARKER;
QUESTION;

It doesn't seem essential.
I bet you can fly an airplane

without liquor.

'

MR. PARKER;

I think that all of this, I

think, points out the sort of peculiarity.

It seems tc

me that the Government's definition starts from the
wrong end, that it says, it sort of assumes, airport
services, when in fact the grants are not provided for
airport services.

They are provided for, if anything,

runway, landing and takeoff kinds of services.
13
14

QUESTION;

Mr. Parker, I'm trying to think of .

tough questions to ask you.

What about port

15
16
17
18

authorities?

They provide all sorts of services for

passengers whc use ships.
MR. PARKER;
QUESTION;

A port authority -Decking facilities, wharves,

19

20
21

22

channels, everything.

And certainly they are recipients

of federal funds.
MR. PARKER;

If the relationship of — and I

take it the question extends tc a ship or a shipping
23
24

company that uses that port authority.
QUESTION;

My question?

I didn't hear you.

(202) 628-9300

HR. PARKER*

I'm sorry.

I take it that the

1

question is not whether the port authority itself is
2

covered, but rather whether it would extend, and I take
3

it if a port authority receives a federal grant.
4

QUESTION*

Hell, your concern is to make sure

5

that handicapped passengers are properly treated when
6

they fly.

I suggest they also should be properly

7

treated when they ride buses and also when they, for
8

whatever reason, go on a tour to the Caribbean and have
9

to use a port facility.
10

So the question in ay mind is where does one
11

draw the line, really, speaking of lines.
12

HR. PARKER*

I think you have to draw the

13

line. Justice Powell, in terms of whether or not there's
14

a federal statute that provides money to that port
15

authority.
16

QUESTION*

I'm sure it does.

17

HR. PARKER*

I think that's correct, I think

18

it does.

I think you would

have to look at the specific

19

grant statute.
20

The peculiarity of this particular grant
21

statute is that it doesn't simply says

Here's money; go

22

run an airport.

It says:

You apply for a grant; we are

23

only going to give money to someone who applies for a
24

grant, who identifies a specific project, and then you

(202) 628-9300

1

can get the money for that specific project.

are not sort of generalized grants that are provided.
And again, I think you'd have to look at the

3
4

specific question.
I would, in the time that I have remaining,

5

6
7

8
9

10
11
12

But they

want to touch on a sort of separate argument here, and
that is the arguments that are raised in parts two and
three of our brief.

Those arguments accept the

Government's definition.

I'm net sure I want to dc that

now .
We accept the Government's definition of the
relevant program or activity as an airport, and we
conclude that, even if that is the program or activity,

13
14

that is if you define it as narrowly as the Government
suggests as only airport services, our suggestion in

15

that part of our brief is that under the DOT'S own
16
17
18

regulations that that airport nevertheless has some
obligations not to discriminate and not to facilitate
discrimination by other entities with which it deals.

19

20

The Government seems to be suggesting in its
reply brief that a program or activity such as an

21
22

airport exists sort of in a bell jar,

sort of

hermetically sealed off from everything else that goes
23
24

on, and suggests that an airport can enter into a
contract with a thirl party that denies access to the

_

airpor t
1

The regulations, which we cite in our brief
2

and which are the DOT'S own regulations, these
3
4

regulations suggest that that's not true; that an
airport, even if the program or activity is defined only

5

as an airport, that that airport nevertheless has some
6

obligations and cannot enter into contracts with third
7

pa rtie s.
8

QUESTION*

So you would say that an airport

9

under the regulations couli

say to the airline*

If

10

you're going to discriminate against the handicapped,
11

we're no longer going to lease you space in the
12

airport.
13

MR. PARKER.*

That's exactly correct, and that,

14

is exactly —
15

QUESTION!

That's your argument right now?

16

MB. PARKER*

Yes, Justice White, it is.

17

QUESTION;

But that is not something the Court

18

of Appeals used, is it?
19

MR. PARKER;

No, it's not.

It's separate, it

20

is a separate argument, and it is driven forward by —
21

QUESTION;

Which you’re making as a

22

Respondent.
23

MR. PARKER;

That's correct, Your Honor.

24

It picks up the question that Justice O'Connor

and which are included in the appendix to our brief,
which would do exactly what we asked in parts two and
three.
We therefore request that the Court, this

remand the regulations to the Department of
Transportation.

remaining.

14

18

Do you have anything

Thank you very much, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I wculd like first of all to emphasize,
because the point is of great importance not just in
this base but as a general matter of interpreting
Section 504 and Title VI, that the proper way to proceed
— and this is where the Court of Appeals we think erred
-- is in this sequence*
Fi’rst, identify the recipient.

That spells

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

the outer limit of regulatory power.

And then identify

1

the program of that recipient which is covered.

That's

2

precisely what this Court did in the Grove City College
3
4

case, and it worked very hard at it.

And we don't think

that the procedure the Court of Appeals used helps
5

analysis.
6

QUESTION*

Well, under your argument do you

7

ever get to the second question?
8

MR. FRIED*

You do not in respect to the

9

commercial airlines, because the commercial airlines are
10

not recipients.
11

QUESTION*

Are not recipients.

12

MR. FRIED*

That is correct.

13

QUESTION*

In your analysis,

just the

14

recipient is the person or the entity to whom the entity
15

goes?
16

MR. FRIED*

That is correct. Justice.

17

QUESTION*

And that's the end of the case?

18

MR. FRIED*

It's the end of this case.

19

QUESTION*

This case, exactly.

20

MR. FRIED*

It certainly wasn't the end of the

21

Grove City College case.

It's important to --

22

QUESTION*

Now we've got this case.

But in

23

this case, you just say the money went to the airport
24

authority and that's all there is to it.

And the Court of Appeals we think went about it the

They constructed it at the highest level of

generality, a program, and then said that people
participating in that program thereby become
recipients.

:

That is correct. Justice White.

what threatens to obliterate the distinction between
0

beneficiaries on one hand, which is a very wide class cr
persons, including the employees of the airlines and the
others, the distinction between beneficiaries and
recipients.
It also threatens to obliterate the

13
14
15
16
17

distinction, as the Court of Appeal^ did, we think,
between the program and the general policy which
Congress had in mind.

That is what we think also

occurred here.
On a practical level, there is a problem.

18

There are what one might call good airlines, airlines
19

20

that make a real effort to accommodate handicapped
persons.

And certainly it would be a serious matter if

21
22

those airlines which seek to accommodate handicapped
persons were unable to do so because of discrimination

by airports.

1

handicapped travelers, are not disadvantaged in that

way.

The reach is not broader than that.

It might be a good idea if the reach were

broader than that, but that seems to us tc be a plea

which is properly adiressai to the Congress.
