ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARK I. LEVY, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7

HR. LEVY*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

8

may it pleas the Court, this case is here on writ of

9

certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the

10

Ninth Circuit.

11

The question presented by our petition is

12

whether under the Fourth Amendment respondent had a

13

reasonable expectation of privacy in a fishing boat, the

14

Sea Otter, and

15

of the boat as the basis for seeking the suppression of

16

evidence .

17

thus was entitled to challenge the search

The District Court held that respondent had no

18

such landing tc move for suppression.

19

appeal pursuant to a conditional guilty plea that

20

reserved the issue of his standing to challenge the

21

cert, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed

22

and held that respondent did have an expectation of

23

privacy in the Sea Otter.

Court.

Although, respondent is the proponent of the

2

motion, had the burden of proof on the issue of his

3

privacy interest, he neither male a factual presentation

4

of his own in the District Court nor contested the

5

government's factual statement.
In

1978, respondent solicited one George

scheme.

transport marijuana from Colombia, South America,

to

11

respondent's ranch on the coast of northern California.

12

crew were to take the boat aid go to Mexico.

to that plan, respondent thereafter purchased the Sea

principles that guide that resolution of the privacy

issue, and it is important for this Court to make clear

15

the legal significance and proper application of those

16

principle s.

17

misunderstanding of those guiding principles.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK I. LEVY, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - RESUMING

7

MR. LEVY*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

8

may it please the Court, before the luncheon recess I

9

was discussing that respondent had no Fourth Amendment

10

privacy interest in the Sea Otter.
Now,

11

in holding that respondent did have a

12

privacy interest, the Court of Appeals majority relied

13

on four factors.

14

rise to a privacy interest on respondent's part.

15

Court of Appeals first relied on respondent’s ownership

16

of the Sea Otter, but the Fourth Amendment prohibition

17

against unreasonable searches protects personal privacy,

18

net property rights, and this Court has made clear that

19

ownership of

20

such create the requisite Fourth Amendment privacy

21

interest.

22

However, those factors do not give
The

the searched area or object does not as

Bare title does not itself create an

23

expectation of privacy.

Now,

this is not to suggest

24

that the Court fas abandoned all reference to property

25

interests in analyzing privacy or that the fact of
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

ownershp is invariably irrelevant.

2

Ownership will often be associated with some

3

use or occupancy or control of the pr-yerty, including

4

the exclusion of others that raises an expectation of

5

privacy, but it is the expectation of privacy deriving

6

from the use or control of the property and not the

7

abstract fact of ownership as such that is the governing

8

Fourth Amendment consideration.

9

Where, as here, the property was never used by

10

the owner, who bought it for the purpose of having other

11

people use it, and had been turned over to the custody

12

and control of others, the owner's paper title does not

13

establish a privacy interest on his part.

14

QUESTION*

May I ask, Mr. Levy, supposing the

15

respondent here had entered some kind of an instruction

16

to the people who were using the boat and said, don't

17

let anybody on the boat except the people working in our

18

— whatever we are up to, and

19

generally on it.

20

Vould that give them any kind of —

MR. LEVYs

No, I don't believe so.

That would

21

not have given him any privacy interest in the boat,

22

given him any personal connection with it that would

can have it for two years as long as nobody else gets on

MR. LEVY*

Again, where he had no previous

connection, no prior privacy interest, that kind of

5

reservation would not by itself create one.

(202) 628-9300

1

kind of expectation of privacy that one might have in

2

it.

3

case all that is far r~nioved from the facts here,

4

the respondent did nothing.

I think that’s correct.

5

Eut let me say in this
where

Let me also add that even if the owner had

6

made some use of the property prior to turning it over

7

tc someone else, the duration of the relinquishment here

8

would be such that we think he would have lost any

9

privacy interest he might previously have had as the

10

result of use, but our primary position here is that he

11

never had any expectation of privacy in the first

12

instance.

13

Now,

the second factor relied on by the Court

14

of Appeals was respondent’s possessory interest in the

15

marihuana that was seized.

16

Salvucci and in Rawlings unmistakably hold that a

17

possessory interest in the items seized neither

18

establish the necessary privacy interest in the areas

19

searched nor serves as a substituta or a surrogate for

20

that privacy interest.

21

This Court’s decisions in

The Court of Appeals opinion confuses the

22

analytically distinct concepts of an interference with a

23

posesssory interest in the seized items, which is the

24

defining characteristic of a seizure, and the intrusion

25

upon a privacy interest in the searched area which is

21

That’s correct.

It was Jeffers.

22

But Jeffers went well beyond that, as the Court has

23

already recognized in Salvucci and in Rakas.

Jeffers, the hotel rooa was rented by the defendant's

aunts.

MR. LEVY*

Not just because of items other

10

than drugs, but because of his access to and use of the

11

12

a sufficient connection or had an expectation of privacy

13

We have no quarrel with that interpretation of

19

Jeffers as the Court has construed it in Rakas and in

20

Salvucci.

21

certainly in light of Rakas and Salvucci, we don't think

22

Jeffers can stand for the proposition that possessory

23

interest in the item seized itself is enough to entitle

24

defendant to challenge the search.

25

Se dc not think Jeffers even at the time but

The Court held squarely to the contrary in

Salvucci and in Rawlings.
Now, I should also say that Salvucci disposes

3

of the respondent's argument that he was entitled co

5

possession of the Sea Otter and its rirjo of marijuana.

6

Salvucci, in overturning the automatic standing rule of

Jones versus United States, hell

8

interest sufficient to establish criminal liability

9

under substantive criminal law principles is not

that a possessory

10

equivalent to a privacy interest protected under the

11

Fourth Amendment.

12

The doctrine of constructive possession is

13

probably the best example of the distinction recognized

14

by the Court's analysis in Salvucci between criminal

15

possession and Fourtn Amendment privacy.

16

third factor, the Court of Appeals pointed to

17

respondent's coventure status in the drug smuggling

18

operation# but it is well settled by the decisions of

19

this Court that a defendant can’.ot vicariously assert

20

the Fourth Amendments rights of his confederates# and

21

respondent concedes that proposition in his brief.

22

Now, as a

lastly considered the presence of water in the Sea

7

Otter's hold which had to be pumped out in order to

8

recover the marijuana debris to be a sign that steps had

9

been taken to hide the marajaana and preserve privacy.

10

This reasoning is flawed on several grounds.

11

First, the fact that a criminal strived to conceal his

12

acts from the authorities in the hopes that he will not

13

get caught is scarcely the same thing as an expectation

14

of privacy, let alone an expectation that society would

15

recognize as reasonable and legitimate.

And whatever the privacy rights those aboard

And the Court of Appeals

Moreover, there is no indication in this case

that respondent had anything to do with the asserted

attempt to conceal the marijuana or that it was intended

19

to maintain his privacy interest.

20

likely explanation for the presence of the water is net

21

that it was used to conceal the marijuana that was being

it can be satisfactorily answered by an analysis of the

analysis requires that you look at events in the way in

that although no privacy interest of the defendant in

This Court’s casas in recant years have made

6

between the interests protected by the proscription on

Seizures and

In Jacobson and Maryland

the proscription on improper

seizures protects people’s interest in property, their

10

possessory interest in things, and therefore it follows

11

as a logical matter, as indeed Footnote 6 of the

12

Salvucci opinion suggests, and I think Place on Pages

13

707 to 710 rather clearly holds that one need not show

14

an expectation of privacy to object to a seizure, and

15

also as Place tells us.

16

If the search which is complained of comes

17

about as a fruit of the improper seizure which precedes

18

it, the rule of Wong Sun means that the se?rch must

follow independent of ary separate judicial inquiry as

to the privacy interest involved in the search of which

22

In this case it is very simple, and I think

them, it is clear.

2

Second, with respect to this Couc t's. decisions

3

in Eakas , Salvucci, and Rawlings, have r_c defense

4

counsel in a terrible box, because in every case we have

5

to analyze the situation and determine under the Court’s

6

holdings whether we should put our client on the witness

7

stand or the witnesses on the witness stand and evaluate

8

whether we have enough without that or whether that is

9

necessary and what strategic advantage, if any, you give

10

up to the government.

11

And I felt that in this case I did not want to

12

put my client on the stand because the government’s

13

submission was sufficient, and I elected to rest upon

14

it.

15

Third and finally, the real problem here is

16

that standing, although in Eakas the Court noted its

17

standing and the substantive issue really merged, they

18

are always theoretically and temporally separate.

19

Standing is a threshold issue, and on many cases the

gives you a full set of

interest has a right to object to the seizure and

Finally, there is one point that I wish to

8

make that is suggested by the government's reply brief.

9

In this case, if the government had gone to Mr. Quinn,

10

an agent of some kind, a DEA agent, a Customs agent, and

11

said, Mr. Quinn, we want permission to seize your

12

vessel, bring it to Urba Buena Island and pump the

13

holds, do we have your permission?

14

at that time instead of Mr. Quinn having been charged in

15

the District Court, the crew members had been charged, I

16

think neither the prosecutor nor the District Court

17

judge would have properly permitted an objection to be

18

made by those persons.

19

Sure, go ahead.

If

He would have said, after hearing the facts to

20

make sure there was a full and voluntary consent, he

21

would have said, no, I find that Quinn had the capacity

22

to consent, and therefore you are bound by his consent

23

under Matlock, Bumper, and the other cases.

24

appear to be only logical and fair that if a person has

25

the capacity and power to consent to a seizure or

I would submit to the Court that under the

4

analysis tells us that a person has the capacity and

5

ability to consent, then that same person has the

6

capacity under the Fourth Amendment standing to raise an

7

objection.
Finally, if I could briefly address the issue

8

9

Aroerunent

of Mr. Quinn’s privacy interest, in this regard, we rely

10

on the Jeffers case and on Bumper.

In Rakas the Court

11

cited Jeffers and Bumper with approval for the

12

proposition that ownership of the property searched

13

coupled — ownership or possessory interest in the

14

property searched coupled with the possessory interest

15

in the property seized gives a reasonable expectation of

16

privacy to allow one to object to a search.
In Salvucci, the Court in, I believe, Footnote

17
18

5, cited Bumper an: Jeffers for: the same proposition.

19

In this case, Mr. Quinn was the owner of both the item

20

searched, the place searched, and the item seized.

21

Under the holding of Jeffers and Bumpers, he has

22

standing.

23

Finally, the government appears, although they

24

dc net urge it here today, in their brief to raise an

25

issue that one can never have an interest in contraband

to permit the assertion of a Foarth Amendment interest

2

¥hile it is undoubtedly true that contraband in plain

3

view, such as in Texas versus Brown, gives right to no

4

fault amendment claim, it is also clear that in

5

Rawlings, for instance,

6

ownership of the contraband was plainly a factor to be

7

considered on the expectation of privacy issue, and in

8

Trupiano and specifically in Jeffers the government made

9

an identical argument, the very same argument that they

the Court held that Rawlings*

10

made here today, urging that because Title 21 at that

time provided that no person shall have an interest in

contraband, that meant that no person could raise a

contraband.

in 1951.
