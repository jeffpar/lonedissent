Mr. Berardo, I think

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. BERARDO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
We urge the Court in this case to affirm the
rule of Carey versus Piphus.
In every 1983 case, except where nominal damages

11

are awarded, litigants be required to prove their actual

12

damages; that is to say there are no presumed or per se

13

damages in the absence of proofs.

14

The trial court and the Sixth Circuit seem to

15

indicate in their opinions concerning this case, that

16

Carey would permit — Excuse me, that Carey applies only

17

in the case of denial of procedural due process, that

18

it doesn't apply where substantive due process may have

19

been involved.

20

distinction.

21

We think that there is no reason for that

QUESTION:

May I ask, counsel, because you started

22

out with Carey v. Piphus, is it your position that damages,

23

intangible damages, emotional distress and mental damages,

24

are recoverable or not?

25

MR. BERARDO:

Justice Stevens, we think that
3

(202) 628-9300

1

emotional distress damages are recoverable as an element

2

of actual damages in any 1983 case for any constitutional

3

deprivation.

QUESTION:

MR. BERARDO:

QUESTION:

Oh, I misread your brief.

7

QUESTION:

And, including a case like Carey

Including this one.

against Piphus?

9
10

Including this one?

MR. BERARDO:

Including a case like Carey againt

Piphus —

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. BERARDO:

If the denial —
If proofs had been made that the

13

actions taken in that case had caused the litigants emotional

14

distress.

15

1983 and we think Carey allow the Court to

16

instruct the jury that actual damages may be awarded and

17

that if actual damages are found that punitive damages

18

may also be awarded.

19

Likewise, if there are no actual damages and

20

a jury finds that nominal damages may be awarded to a

21

litigant in a 1983 action, then punitive damages may also

22

be awarded.

23

In addition, of course, a matter that is not

24

before a jury, attorney's fees may be available to the

25

litigant under Section 1988.

QUESTION:

1

Mr. Berardo, did you say that punitive

2

damages would be available in a case like this against

3

the School District?

4

MR. BERARDO:

Justice Rehnquist, our position

5

throughout, and I think the instructions of the court

6

in this case, were that punitive damages could not be

7

awarded against the School District.

8

QUESTION:

Because of the City of Newport?

9

MR. BERARDO:

Because of the City of Newport.

However, it is our position that the instructions

10
11

given, which was the basis, for this Court's grant of

12

certiorari, in effect allows the jury to award a punitive

13

award agasint the School District in violation of Carey,

14

Newport, and other precedents.
QUESTION:

15
16
17

Say that again.

Our action does

what?
MR. BERARDO:

The’'instruction involved here

18

allowed the jury to consider the intrinsic value of the

19

constitutional rights that were defied.

20
21

Your Honor, my next point in my argument was
to get to the sequence of the instructions.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. BERARDO:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BERARDO:

You go ahead.

You do it your way.

And that will explain your question.

You do it your way.
First, the jury was authorized
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to award actual damages, being admonished not to consider

2

speculative damages.

3

Then the jury was authorized, if they found

4

no actual damages, to award nominal damages and in both

5

cases to award punitive damages.

6

After having been instructed on damages in that

7

manner, the jury was then instructed that it could award

8

damages for the instrinic value of the constitutional

9

rights, taking into account the importance of the right

10

in the history of our country and the importance of the

11

right in the context of the activities in which the

12

Plaintiff was involved at the time of the deprivation.

13

Sequentially, and because the jury has already

14

been admonished not to award punitive damages against

15

a municipal corporation prior to receiving the intrinsic

16

value instruction, it is then permitted to look at the

17

intrinsic value and award damages against the Board of

18

Education for the intrinsic value of the right in the

19

absence of any proof that there were damages that flowed

20

from what the Board of Education did or that the intrinsic

21

value is involved at all.

22

I think in that way, by viewing the instructions

23

as a whole and looking at the sequence, it can be seen

24

that the instruction is extremely prejudicial, first of

25

all, to the Board of Education, but, secondly, to the
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

rest of the defendants in the case.

2

so prejudicial is because as to the rest of the defendants,

3

they have already been considered in light of the punitive

4

damages instruction and the additional inherent value

5

instruction allows a multiplier effect after punitive

6

damages have already been considered.

7

The reason it is

The objection to the instruction that was given

8

and the instruction again is -- the complaint of instruction

9

is the intrinsic value instruction is that it violated

10
11

the rule of Carey versus Piphus.
Secondly, that it allowed the jury to speculate

12

as to damages which is a violation of Carey and other

13

precedents.

14

The speculation is I think most troublesome

15

to the defendants and petitioners in this case.

16

one measure the value of the First Amendment or any

17

procedural due process right?

18
19

20

How can

It invites the jury to order or prioritize or
find a value for really a priceless right.
The instruction to the jury itself indicated

21

that damages for the intrinsic value of those rights are

22

very difficult to measure, but, in effect, that instruction

23

told the jury that the value of those rights are great.

24

They were presumed by the court to have great value because

25

of the context of the deprivation.

1

As a result, in terms at least of the objection

2

that was made to the court, it was quite clear, not only

3

to the court but to plaintiffs and defendants at trial,

4

what the nature of the objection to the instruction was.

5

The court responded on the motion for judgment

6

nothwithstanding the verdict to further objection concerning

7

the instruction, saying that counsel had not requested

8

the court to segregate the damages between procedural

9

and substantive deprivation.

10

We would urge the Court to consider that it

11

would have made no difference that procedural and substantive

12

deprivations were segregated for purposes of determining

13

if the award was proper.

14

The real distinction is whether intrinsic value

15

damages could be segregated from actual damages for the

16

deprivation of a right.

17

There are several unwarranted consequences of

18

the instruction.

19

conflicts with the availability of nominal damages.

20

is just no reason to give a nominal damage instruction

21

if you can, in the absence of nominal damages <?r in the

22

absence of actual damages, give damages for the intrinsic

23

value of these rights.

13

Are you contending that the instructions told
the jury that they could award damages even if there were
no injury to the plaintiffs of any kind?
MR. BERARDO:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think if you

read the instructions —

I am reading from page 93.

"If you

14

find that the plaintiff is entitled to a verdict, you

15

may award him only such damages as will reasonably com­

preponderance of the evidence."

words say there has to be an injury?

MR. BERARDO:

Don't they in so many

Justice Stevens, even though the

20

instructions seem to indicate that there has to be an

21

injury, if you will look on page 96 of the instructions,

22

after nominal damages have been discussed -- I am assuming

23

that a jury which has these instructions with them in

the jury room deliberating is going through each paragraph,

25

paragraph by paragraph, to determine what they are going

14

It says, "damages for type of injury

are more difficult to measure."

. MR. BERARDO:
Honor.

QUESTION:

The injury is the deprivation of

the constitutional right.
MR. BERARDO:

16

QUESTION:

18

That presumes an injury, Your

We think that violates Carey.

17

Doesn't that assume there

has got to be an injury?

12

They have gone through

Excuse me, Your Honor.

Isn't the injury the deprivation

of the constitutional right?
MR. BERARDO:

I think not.

I think that traditiona

19

tort recovery concepts require an injury to be something

20

other than an abstract deprivation of a right.

21

22

It is

not the deprivation of the right to —
QUESTION:

I would think you would say the court

23

was implying or saying that it is enough to find injury

24

in a sense of the deprivation of a constitutional right.

25

MR. BERARDO:

Then, Your Honor, I think Carey
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

would require that nominal damages be awarded.
QUESTION:

2
3

Very well.

I would think you would

say that is exactly what the court meant.

4

MR. BERARDO:

However, damages as opposed to

5

injury flow from the expectation that the plaintiff might

6

have had to exercise certain rights, including First

7

Amendment rights.
QUESTION:

9

Under Tennessee law may you recover

in an automobile accident case for the abstract violation

10

of a constitutional right not to be run down by an auto­

11

mobile?

12

MR. BERARDO:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BERARDO:

I think —

Or do you just recovery the injury?
Mr. Chief Justice, I think that

15

there would be no damages permitted for that kind of injury,

16

but there would be damages permitted for pain and suffering

17

and emotional stress under Michigan law if a constitutional

18

or statutory right were, of course, involved.

QUESTION:

Loss of employment, permanent dis­

20

ability, all that sort of thing?

common law generally?

tort liability concepts that prevailed at the time Section

6

1983 was drafted.

7

It is standard tort liability concepts that

Another factor that flows from the giving of

8

this instruction is that damages for procedural deprivations

9

might be awarded where there is no proof of actual damages.

10

This violates both Carey and common sense.

Damages additionally would be allowed without

12

regard to any objective standards for determining what

13

those damages are.

this Court has clearly stated, in Carey and in other cases

that —

There is no objective standard of

Let me ask you a hypothetical question.

19

Supposing you had a community that wouldn't — that didn't

20

like one particular religion, say they didn't like Catholics,

21

and there was a priest in town that wanted to go to mass

22

and the police just wouldn't let him go to mass and he

23

brought a 1983 and he couldn't prove any damages, he just

24

was not allowed to exercise his right to go to church,

damages or no damages?

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

MR. BERARDO:

1

I think, Justice Stevens, the

2

answer to that question depends on the proofs that are

3

put in by the plaintiff.

4

of his right to exercise freedom of religion was such

5

that it caused him humiliation in front of his friends

6

in the community or that it caused him emotional distress

7

that would be observable by a third party —
QUESTION:

10

Suppose it didn't cause him anything,

he just couldn't go to church and he very deeply wanted
to go to church.
MR. BERARDO:

11
12

Assuming that the expectation

Then he is entitled to nominal

damages.
QUESTION:

13

Mr. Berardo, you don't question,

14

do you, that a jury properly instructed in your view of

15

the law of the case could have returned this amount of

16

damages for the plaintiff or do you question that?
MR. BERARDO:

17

Justice Rehnquist, we don't know

18

what the jury considered in this case.

19

how deeply this award was tainted by the instruction.
QUESTION:

20

We don't know

No, that is why I asked you the

21

question.

Assuming that the jury had not received this

22

instruction that you claim was wrong and had been properly

23

instructed in your view of the law, do you think it could

24

nonetheless — Could you claim that a verdict by this

25

was excessive?
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. BERARDO:

I think you might claim that this

2

verdict was excessive, Your Honor, because it was more

3

than double what plaintiff's attorney asked for in his

4

final argument.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BERARDO:

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. BERARDO:

9

Well, that isn't an invariable.
No.

It wouldn't be unconstitutional.
I agree, but in view of defendant's

counsel it is certainly an indication that this award

10

included factors other than what plaintiff's counsel at

11

least argued to the jury at the conclusion of the trial.

12

I think it is just as likely, perhaps even more

13

likely that in light of this particular instruction that

14

this damage award did exceed what would have been given

15

for actual damages.

16

In this case, for example, the plaintiff was

17

suspended with pay and never lost a day's pay throughout

18

the pendency of the case.

19

by the School District.

20

In fact, is still employed

That particular fact which was, indeed, before

21

the jury, that he had continued to be paid throughout

22

the period of the dispute, was apparently ignored in

23

calculating the damages.

24
25

QUESTION:

But, he got some very bad publicity,

didn't he, of the same sort that a liable plaintiff is
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

apt to get?

2

MR. BERARDO:

Justice Rehnquist, he did get

3

very bad publicity the same as a liable plaintiff might

4

be expected to get, but this wasn't a liable for a deformation

5

case.

6

to the jury as one so that those kinds of per se damages

7

that might be available in that case weren't available

8

and weren't presented to the jury.

9
10

It wasn't tried as one and it wasn't presented

QUESTION:

Could there be a recovery for liable

against a school board as such?

11

MR. BERARDO:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BERARDO:

14
15

I —

As distinguished from individuals.
As a state law case, I think not.

I think they are entitled to immunity under state statute.
QUESTION:

Mr. Berardo, if we were to agree

16

with you on the single question of proper instructions

17

for damages for intrinsic value of a constitutional right,

18

is there any need to do more than to remand it for a new

19

trial on damages alone as opposed to liability?

20

MR. BERARDO:

I think not, Justice O'Connor,

21

for the reason that this Court in granting certiorari

22

failed to grant certiorari as to Issue No. 2 in our petition

23

which was more factually oriented, therefore, I presume

24

from the Court's action on our petition that the facts

25

in this case are settled and we are only talking now about
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

damages and the proper calculation of damages.
At this juncture then it would be appropriate

2
3

for me to say that we think that should be requested

4

because of this tainted award is that this case should

5

be remanded to the Sixth Circuit — Excuse me, remanded

6

for retrial and that the decision of the Sixth Circuit

7

be overruled.

8

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY A. HELDT, ESQ.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12

13
14

Mr. Heldt?

MR. HELDT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Mr. Berardo and I have been trying two different

15

cases since at least 1982 when this case went to trial.

16

I guess it does my heart good we still are.

17

The issue here as we see it is not as it has

18

been defined by the petition or by the petitioners.

19

issue is rather does Carey versus Piphus require a jury

20

to ignore the historical and contextual significance of

21

the constitutional rights it finds were violated when

22

it reaches the point in its deliberations that it must

23

assess damages and assign a monetary value.

24
25

We think the answer is obviously no.

The

We don't

expect a jury should be compelled to ignore both our history
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

and the context of the activities in which the plaintiff

2

was engaged in at the time his rights were violated.

3
4

QUESTION:

You think they could consider it

wholly apart from any instruction?

5

MR. HELDT:

6

QUESTION:

Wholly apart from any instruction?
Suppose Judge Harvey had not given

7

the instruction of which complaint is made here.

8

feel the jury could and might well consider the nature

9

of the rights infringed in the jury room.

10

MR. HELDT:

They certainly could.

I think that

11

a plaintiff is entitled to an instruction assuring the

12

jury that they may and that is all we are talking about

13

here.

14

room that we generally never know about because we simply

15

don't try and ask them afterwards in any legal way what

16

did you do and how did you reach your results?

17

They may consider all sorts of things in the jury

QUESTION:

And, hence, I take it, you would

18

say it would be quite proper for the judge to say now

19

as a matter of damages I am instructing you that there

20

has been no evidence presented of any actual injury in

21

the sense of monetary loss or pain or suffering or humilia­

22

tion or anything like that.

23

But, there is a constitutional right involved

24

and was violated and the jury may consider what that is

25

worth and return a judgment for whatever damages they

think it is worth.

So what is your answer to it?

right which was violated.

Right.
As Justice Stevens said, if you

are not allowed to go to church, perhaps that is a case --

process.

17

My answer is that that would be

permissible depending on the nature of the constitutional

13

I think it might well is presented

Then you have problems with Carey

You have got to limit that to procedural due

MR. HELDT:

No, I don't think that is true.

18

I don't think that Carey requires that you must either

19

MR. HELDT:

No.

I am saying that they are entitled

to consider the significance of the conduct in which my

client was engaged and the significance of the rights

4

which are violated in deciding whether his mental anguish

5

is genuine, in deciding how big it is, how severe it is.

6

QUESTION:

That is what I say.

You would say

7

the jury should be able to give more damages for mental

8

anguish. If the constitutional right is not being able

9

to go to church, then perhaps say the denial of a procedural

10
11

due process.
MR. HELDT:

No, I would formulate it differently.

12

I would say there is a world of difference between a

13

plaintiff who suffers mental anguish because a tornado

14

came out of the midwestern skies and killed his family.

15

He suffers all the mental anguish in the world, but it

16

comes from something that is unpredictable and uncontrollable

17

and that is just a part of life.

That is not the same as the plaintiff who instead

and a fourth time on the student plaintiff, James David

McDonald's claim, as well.
And, the court said, even in the student plaintiff's

4
5

case, although the student plaintiff only asks for nominal

6

damages and nothing more, one of the elements that James

7

David McDonald must prove is that he suffered damages as

8

a result of — as a proximate result of the conduct of

9

the defendants.
And, it is not hard to understand in this record

10
11

why the jury no-caused Mr. McDonald.because Mr. McDonald

12

didn't take the stand and he didn't try and testify that

13

he suffered some damage and there was no expert testimony

14

of damage.

15

had been damaged at all.

There was no testimony that James David McDonald

I started to say that once the court is satisfied

19

20

that a plaintiff has met that element of proof, has

21

established some quantum of damage, the case goes to the

22

jury and the instructions on damages are merely a guide

23

to assessing and weighing the damages that the jury is

24

obligated to find in order to satisfy those elements of

proof.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PATRICK J. BERARDO

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS — REBUTTAL

16

MR. BERARDO:

17

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

18

Just a couple of very brief points.

19

all, to say the principal arguments here are raised for

20

the first time belies the fact that the arguments to the

21

jury and the entire presentation of this case to the trial

22

court from defendants' side was aimed at attempting to

23

limit the damages to those that were caused by the action

24

of the defendants.

25

First of

Causation has been an issue throughout this case

1

and continues to be the issue today.

2

we submit, does not adequately reflect the fact that

3

causation is the elementary principle of damages that over­

4

rides the entire system of tort compensation.

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. BERARDO:

7

QUESTION:

The instruction,

Does your objection go to causation?
Justice O'Connor, I think so.

As I looked at it, your objection

8

to the instruction was that they allowed the jury to

9

speculate on the value of a constitutional right citing

10

Carey.

11

MR. BERARDO:

To say speculate to me means to

12

permit the jury to determine damages without relation to

13

objective factors and without relation to what caused the

14

damages.

15

In fact, the instruction itself defined a violation

16

of constitutional rights or a deprivation of constitutional

17

rights as the injury, then went on to allow damages to

18

be awarded without regard to either causation or determina­

19

tion of actual injury.

20
21

22

I think if you read that instruction, you will
get that flavor.
Notwithstanding the rest of the precautionary

23

instructions, the fact that it is given last in that context

24

would allow the jury to award damages without regard to

25

actual injury.

1

Secondly, to say that Carey versus Piphus is

2

not the substantive due process case is not entirely

3

accurate because Briscoe in a companion case had a free

4

speech claim concerning his earring and that, I submit,

5

was before the Court at the time that was decided.

6

Court at that time declined to say that the rule didn't

7

apply in substantive due process cases but left the question

8

opened to be determined in each individual circumstance

9

depending upon the right involved.

10

The

I think additionally it is inconsistent for counsel

11

to argue that after asking for an award — Excuse me, after

12

asking for an instruction on damages that he can then take

13

the position, either before the jury or before this Court,

14

that the instruction is harmless when, in fact, the intent

15

of the instruction was to permit damages to be awarded

16

and to permit the jury to assess factors in assessing the

17

damages against the defendants that otherwise would not

18

have been assessed.

19

Finally, proof of actual damages in this case

20

does not cure the error of this overbroad instruction.

21

It only exacerbates the error.

22

Thank you.
