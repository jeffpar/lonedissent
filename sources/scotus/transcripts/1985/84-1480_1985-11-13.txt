14

went into great detail as to the basis for their

17

that Officer Pila font's testimony regarding respondent's

18

exercise of his Miranda rights, the whole colloquy from

19

the time he met -- it was part of the whole description

20

of Greenfield's behavior from the time Officer Pilafont

encountered him on the beach

followed, argued this whole chain of behavior as

evidence that the jury could consider tending

objection was overruled by the trial court.

The

2

Eleventh Circuit ultimately ordered a new trial in this

3

cause, stating that the prosecutor -- the use of

4

respondent's sanity at his trial violated the decision

5

of this court in Doyle versus Ohio.

6

brought themselves in conflict with Sulie versus

7

Duckworth, the Seventh Circuit case, which basically

8

said that Doyle did not apply in the context cf an

9

insanity defense, and that really is the crucial

In so doinc, they

question here, and the distinction the state draws

11

between Doyle in this case.
In Doyle, of course, this Court held that a

12
13

respondent's silence following the Miranda warnings was

14

insolubly ambiguous, that it should not be used to

15

suggest to the jury that — I think the inference that

16

we realize juries traditionally make, which is, if this

17

defendant were innocent, if he did not commit this

18

crime, well, then why when confronted with it by the

19

police aid he fail to make a statement?
Doyle prescribed this use of silence after the

20
21

Miranda warning had been given.

Our argument today is

22

that where, as in this case,

23

Greenfield committed the substantive offense, it is

24

virtually uncontroverted that he committed sexual

the issue is not whether

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

The question becomes whether he should be held

accountable for his conduct at the time of that offense

because he allegedly did not know right from wrong, but

Miranda warning.
Supposing the issue were just guilt and not

insanity.

Wouldn't some of that be able to come in

under Doyle?

other problem that we have is that, and the argument

10

that we have continued to make, that since there was no

11

argument, no objection to the trial testimony cf these

12

officers, that it was proper to argue that testimony in

13

closing argument.

14

It was properly before the court.

15

Court of Appeal noted that there had been no objection

16

tc the officer's testimony.

17

that they addressed the merits of this case basically in

18

the alternative, giving effect to the procedural

question as well.

It could come in without objection.

QUESTION;

the closing argument.

Since they

Do you respond to your opponent's

argument that since the Appellate Court, I guess after

19

20

merits.

21

object problem, when the state court addresses the

22

merits?

23

Doesn't that cure the Wainwright failure to

FIS. PASCHALL;

We argue that, and I guess our

24

argument in response to that -- first, to answer your

25

question, yes, if the state court addresses it on the
1 u
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

merits without addressing it in the alternative, it

2

would cure the Wainwright v. Sikes problem.
Wa contend,

3

first of all, that the Second

4

District addressed the merits in the alternative in

5

their original opinion.

6

Supreme Court on conflict, our own conflict certiorari.

7

The Supreme Court sent it down, hack to the Second

8

District, to determine whether the case was in conflict

9

with Clark versus State.

It went up to the Florida

Now, Clark is basically a contemporaneous

10
11

objection case.

It says that if you do not object to a

12

comment on the exercise of the right to remain silent at

13

trial, you have waived it.

14

they sent it back down to consider in light of a

15

contemporaneous objection case, that that in fact is

16

what the second district was saying, is yes, we are

17

consistent with Clark, we have given effect to the

18

procedural default as Clark lid.
QUESTION;

19

Dur argument is that since

I really don't understand why they

20

would do that if they thought that it was -- if there

21

wasn't a problem on the merits, why would they ask the

22

appellate court to taka a second look at it.

23

Appellate Court ruled in favor of the prosecutor, didn't

24

they?

25

MS. PASCHALL;

Yes,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

QUESTION;

And so what they did is, your view

is, they sent it back to say,

reason for ruling in favor of the prosecutor?

isn't there a different

MS. PASCHALLs

7

And we are left to some extent

8

with speculation on precisely what the motivation was

9

there.

10

QUESTION;

But I suppose at the time you filed

11

your brief on the merits in the Court of Appeals, that

12

is, the Federal Court of Appeals, the reason you didn't

13

argue Wainwright against Sikes must have been that you

14

thought the Appellate Court had addressed the merits.

15

MS. PASCHALL;

16

QUESTION;

17

MS. PASCHALL;

The reason --

I shouldn't speculate that.
The reason we didn't argue

18

Wainwright versus Sikes was, we did not and we made a

19

judgment call at that time.

20

emphasis on the merits of the opinion.

21

cross-appealed — we had not objected to the

magistrate's report and recommendation that said the

We had not

I don't think we had to object to the

cross-appeal then on the Wain weight v. Sikes issue.

We

2

just talked about the merits in the Eleventh Circuit,

3

and quite frankly, if the Eleventh Circuit hadn’t jumped

4

into the fray and chosen to address that issue for us,

5

don’t know that we could be here on the Wainw right v.

6

Sikes problem.

7

I would say just as the federal courts can

8

address an issue on the merits when the state courts

9

don’t give effect to their procedural default rules and

I

10

address the merits of the claim, here, where we have the

11

Eleventh Circuit claim, we are talking about the Sikes

12

issue, and making what we believe is an erroneous

13

determination.

before this Court.

We have got an obligation to bring it

QUESTION:

15

But what they said in their

16

footnote was that the Florida District Courts of

17

Appeals’

problem, and I think you agree with that if they did in

19

fact address the merits, so the question is only whether

20

they addressed the merits or not, isn't it, net. whether

21

they stated the law incorrectly.

22

footnote says, anyway,

willingness to address the merits solves the

Two-fold.
