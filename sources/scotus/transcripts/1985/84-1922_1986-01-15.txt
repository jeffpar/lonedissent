Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court, in November of

1984, respondent, was

called before a grand jury investigating espionage, and
asked three questions;

whether she had ever met with

agents of the Czechoslovak Intelligence Cervice; whether
she had ever delivered classified documents relating to
the national security

of the United States to those

agents; and whether she had a ver been paid for the
delivery of those documents.
She refused to answer, claimim that her
answers would be adverse- to the interests of her husband ■
and citing both the marital testimonial privilege and the
marital confidential communications privilege.
'She has since agreed that no confidential
communiations would be involved in answering the
questions.

A hearing was held on whether respondent

The District. Court

10

would have to agree with us that we had come forward with

independent evidence showing that there, was a probable

13

In analogous ciccamstances involving the

14

marital communications privilege or the lawyer-client

15

privilege, which also do not protect communications made

16

in furtherance of joint criminal activities, courts have

17

faced similar problems, and they have not been

18

insurmountable by any

19

means.

It is worth pointing out that the need for

20

probative evidence is greater in cases involving joint

21

in preserving marciages between criminals, and because
recognizing privilege in these circumstances encourages a
recruitment of spouses as co-conspirators.
I would life to briefly discuss two arguments
respondent makes that do not add to our argument.

One

argument that respondent repeatedly makes is an argument
that decent people have a natural repugnance to watching
one spouse testify against another.

As an initial matter, it is worth noting that
Wigmcre, who coined the phrase "natural repugnance,"
dismissed this argument summarily, and

that this Court in

comprehensively reviewing the privilege in

Trammel did

net mention it.
Nevertheless,

we is not think that there is

nothing to this argument.

Instead, we think it. is

a restatement of the personal

interest,

lerely

the

non-utilitarian interest in marital harmony that weighs
on the ether side of the balance, the side favoring that
condition.
But we think it is nothing more than that, and
we do not think it is a particularly weighty factor.
people, at least,

have a natural repugnance to

evidentiary rules that allow guilty defendants to go free
because of the introduction of evidence against them that
proves their guilt has been prohibited.
