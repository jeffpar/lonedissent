Mr. Van Koten, I think

MR. VAN KOTENi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court!
This case is here on a writ of certiorari to
the District of Columbia Circuit which,

in a decision

10

written by Judge Starr reversed the summary judgment

11

granted by Judge Richey of the District — of the U.S.

12

District Court for the District cf Columbia.

13

dissented from that decision and held that the decision

14

should have been affirmed.

Judge Rock

The chronology of this case in the district

abortive efforts at discovery, but the first discovery

19

which is truly relevant to this proceeding was

20

propounded in February 1981, which was a joint Defense

21

set of interrogatories, 52 in number, numbers 51 and 52

22

of which asked very specific questions about product

23

exposure and asked very specific questions about

24

witnesses who would testify to product exposure.

Calotex had previously made a motion for

14

summary judgment in September, which was withdrawn.

15

Celotex renewed its motion in December.

16

the trial judge would seriously be considering motions

17

for summary judgment based upon the lack of product

18

identification cannot possibly have been a surprise to

19

Plaintiffs* trial counsel since the district court judge

20

had already granted a number of such motions.

21

the motion was pending from December 1981 until July

22

1982 when the judge finally ruled it.

23

The fact that

However,

There has been a lot of attention given in

24

Respondent’s brief to whether the motion went only to

exposure to Celotex products in the District of Columbia

or to exposure anywhere.

2

the language of the motion may not have been a model of

3

clarity, the statement cf undisputed facts certainly

indicated that there was no evidence of exposure to

5

Celotex products either in the District of Columbia or

6

anywhere else.

I would submit that although

That certainly was the view of the

majority in the Court of Appeals.
HR. VAN KOTENi

It was the view of all three

of the members of the Court of Appeals.

11

QUESTION!

12

HR.

All three.

VAN KOTENi

And it was the view of the

13

district judge as well since he said that there was no

14

admissible evidence of exposure in the District of

15

Columbia or elsewhere.

16
17
18

QUESTION«

Well, was there any inadmissible

evidence of exposure anywhere else?
HR. VAN KOTENi

There was testimony of the

19

decedent at his Workmen’s Comp proceeding which was a

20

proceeding at which Celotex was not a party and which

21

counsel for Respondent concede at this point is

22

inadmissible for any purpose.

23

QUESTION!

How about that letter from Mr. —

what is it, Mr. Hoff?

in Illinois, was he?

It was not under oath.

He was

Where was he?

HR. VAN KOTENa

That's correct, Justice

White.

13

QUESTION*

Suppose his letter was unambiguous

14

that he knew, he knew that, from personal knowledge that

15

this man had been exposed to asbestos, and there he was,

16

and you knew,

it.

19

the Plaintiff had at some point in this

So you knew about the letter-, didn't you?
HR. VAN KOTEN*

The first time that the letter

20

was produced was in response to Celotex's first motion

21

for summary judgment.

QUESTION*

Right, right, so you knew about it

when you finally made your second motion.
HR. VAN KOTENs

That's correct, Celotex*s

trial counsel did.

the Plaintiff had said we are going to call Hr. Hoff.
HR. VAN KOTENt

3
4

if ell, and suppose that

Wall, the Plaintiff had said

that. Justice White.
The point that I think is important to focus

5

6

upon is that we only reached that question, that Celotex

7

is correct on the first issue in this case and on the

8

issue that’s really the reason that the petition for

9

cert was filed --

10

QUESTION*

Which is what?

11

MR. VAN KOTEN*

Which is that the holding cf

12

the majority below that the Plaintiff need produce

13

nothing, the Plaintiff could have simply sat silent

14

because Celotex did not affirmatively produce evidence

15

cf no liability.

16

Celotex, that it was not sufficient to point to the fact

17

that Plaintiff had not indicated that there was any

18

admissible evidence of liability, that Plaintiff had --

19

that Celotex had to show that the Plaintiff could not

20

produce any admissible evidence of liability, that

21

burden is a burden which it would be impossible for

22

Celotex to meet because, let’s say that Celotex went

23

back, and prevailed upon the problems of Mr. Hoff’s

24

letter.

25

because even if Mr. Hoff was clearly mistaken, Celotex

The majority below expressly said that

2

never any other exposure at any other point in the

decedent’s life.

It seems to me that it might be

White.

That may be correct, Justice

I —

10

QUESTION*

Who do you think would have to --

11

if this letter was a straightforward latter that really

12

did give some credence to the Plaintiff’s case, do you

13

think, to make your motion, do you think you would have

14

to go take his deposition?
MR. VAN KOTEN*

15

Had I been trial counsel for

16

Celotex, if the letter indicated that Mr. Koff really

17

knew something, I would have certainly been there taking

18

the deposition in Chicago in any event.
QUESTION*

19

The majority in the Court of

20

Appeals expressly refused to pass on the admissibility

That was the position taken by the Fifth

I would point out that if the opinion of the

10

majority in the D.C. Circuit was correct, I do not -- I

11

don't believe that from the state of the record in the

would have ever even been be fore the Court because at

14

the trial court level and at the appellate court level,

counsel for .the Plaintiff in

in this case,

incorrectly placing the burl en upon the Plaintiffs to

question was not the juestion of who had the initial

2

burden of producing evidence on a motion for summary

3

judgment, at least where the motion for summary judgment

4

was made by the party who had not had the burden of

5

proof at trial, but that the real question is whether

6

looking at all of the evidence in totality, the Court is

7

persuaded that there is not in fact a genuine dispute of

8

material fact, and in the opinion of the Third Circuit

9

in that case,

in the opinion of the Fifth Circuit in

appropriate to consider who will have the burden of

13

reading what the record was before this Court in

Adickes, that there was ample circumstantial evidence

with which to support the Plaintiff's claim.

was no direct evidence.

QUESTION*

The real

May I ask you to comment on one

thing that I'm a little puzzled about?
The motion, as I read it, said -- directs the

21

Court's attention to proximate cause as a result of

22

distribution within the jurisdictional limits of the

23

district courts, and then ia your memorandum in support,

24

the record is totally devoid of any such evidence within

25

the jurisdictional confines of this Court.

I get the impression the motion was intended

2

to say that if there wasn't anything thing the case to

3

this particular federal district, that you would

4

prevail.

5

Is that a correct reading of your motion?

MR.

VAN KOTENi

Well, I wasn't trial counsel

for Celctex, and my firm wasn't. Justice Stevens, so I

can't say for sure.

However, the statement of material

further than that, I believe —
QUESTION!

But it ends at the last sentence on

12

that — I'm trying to find it,

13

"within the jurisdictional limits of this Court."

14

that seems to be consistent with the notion.

15

MR. VAN KOTEN;

172, ends with the words
So

But it — well, but I believe,

16

Justice Stevens, it is phrased in the alternative.

17

says there is no evidence whatsoever that the decedent

18

was ever exposed to any product containing asbestos

19

designed, manufactured or distributed by Celctex

21

proximate cause of the decedent's death within the

jurisdictional limits of the Court.

You see, I was wondering if,

2

although they didn’t put in admissible evidence in

7

Nell, Justice Stevens, I’m not

sure, but it’s also well settled that a district judge

9

may grant a motion for summary judgment upon grounds

10

other than those cited in the motion, and two cases to

11

that effect are Broderick Wood Products v. U.S.,

12

2d 433 and Board of National Missions v. Smith, 182 F.

In their brief Respondents concede that had Judge Richey

set up a formal discovery schedule and had the formal,

the tine for discovery stated, and

that formal schedule

ended, that at that point, if the Plaintiffs had not

produced admissible evidence of exposure to Celotex

4

products, that the district court could have granted a

5

motion for summary judgment on that basis.

4

In this case there never was a formal order

6
7

entered stating when discovery must cease.

A number of

8

judges in the District Court for the District of

9

Columbia, at any rats, don’t typically enter that order,

10

that type of an order.

11

Judge Richey had made it very clear in ruling on

12

previous summary judgment motions that he thought that

13

the time to try to come up with some kind of admissible

14

evidence to keep individual defendants in the case was

15

rapidly disappearing.

QUESTION;

Well, except if he thought -- if he

12

thought that was a legal essential element of the

13

Plaintiff's claim, exposure in the District, he wouldn't

have asked for further discovery because the Plaintiff

15

said we can’t get you anything on that point.

16

would just dismiss the case.

But, and you don't contend that that would
make the case deficient, as I understand you.
MR.

VAN KOTEN;

I don't contend, certainly,

20

that it would make for a ruling on the merits as was

21

entered in this case.

22

The, again, the crux of our cae is that the

23

opinion of the majority below in holding that simply

24

pointing to the failure of the party with the burden of

25

proof at trial to produce any indications in discovery

that they had admissible evidence, makes -QUESTION*

2

That would have -- if they had

3

obtained an affidavit from Hoff, for example, and he

4

stated it on his own knowledge that there was exposure

in Illinois, that would have satisfied the Plaintiff's
)

6

requirement in your view, I suppose.
MR. VAN K3TEM*

7

I

think that -- I

think that’s

8

correct.

If Mr. Hoff had stated that there was exposure

9

to Celotex products — and that’s another issue that was

10

not briefed and argued in the district court, but I

11

think it’s quite clear that Plaintiffs could not

12

possibly prevail upon exposure to Carey-Canadian

13

Asbestos products.

14

prove such exposure,

15

case falls woefully short of showing that they could in

16

fact produce evidence of exposure to those products,

17

rule that has been urged by pretty much unanimously the

18

academic commentators and has been held by the Fifth

19

Circuit in Fontaneau and Third Circuit in

20

Electronics Products, which would harmonize the burden

21

on the motion for summary judgment with the burden at

22

trial is a rule which will have salutary effects in

23

permitting trial courts to narrow down the issues in the

24

case to what are in fact the real issues, and my firm on

25

occasion represents plaintiffs as well as defendants.

SR. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

Our position in this case is a simple one.

When Celotex moved for summary judgment, it relied

solely on the state of the record as it then stood in

the case.

therefore there was no obligation on the part of the

20

Flaintiff to come back with any sort of affidavits tc

21

substantiate her case, and that is essentially the point

22

I’m making here as well.

23

because, although these two types of trial evidence were

nothing to offer — did nothing in its motion to contest

I read the majority opinion, and I think it’s

hard to read it otherwise, as saying that we don’t have

Well, Your Honor, I think that the

Court of Appeals* opinion is somewhat vague on what kind

4

of support you have to offer before your motion is

5

valid, but they were quite clear that you didn't have to

6

offer an affidavit, and they said several times, we are

7

not going to tell you exactly what sort of support you

8

have to offer.

9

But the law is quite clear that you have two

10

choice when you move for summary judgment.

11

can produce affirmative evidence to show that you are

12

not liable, or you can just ask the Plaintiff to preview

13

his trial case, and when he does so, you can then try to

14

show that that trial case won't do the job.

done that, you still don't have to come up with

MR. SMITH!

Yes.

I think that technically

15

what it meant was here the motion was unsupported, so

16

there was no need for an evidentiary response in the

17

form of affidavits from a witness.

18

defendant should have taken the first step, and they

19

were looking at it in that sort of sequential way saying

20

the defendant's burden hadn’t been carried; therefore,

21

the plaintiff had a right not to submit affidavits.

22

QUESTION!

Instead,

the

While Mr. Hoff’s name was identified and while

Those interrogatories were never answered.
With respect to whether Celotex conceded on

24

the point about any exposure in Chicago, I think I only

25

have to refer to the argument of Celotex's trial counsel

1

before Judge Richey where he, where he referred to the

2

answers to interrogatories and indicated those answers

3

to date still would not satisfy the court as to product

identification cf any Celotex product or cc-workers who

5

wouli then identify on behalf of the decedent exposure

6

to asbestos products manufactured by Celotex in this

7

area or in any other area, including Chicago
I think that it was clear that that was before

the court.
QUESTION*

10

Yes, but right before that he said

11

the only exposure, on page 211, to any Celotex product

12

by the decedent was in Chicago, and by documents

13

attached to their answers to interrogatories, the letter

14

to Hoff and so forth, it seems to me they are assuming

15

there that there was exposure in Chicago.
Now, it's true as you say later, the answers

to interrogatories, apart from the letter, don't say

18

that.

they were exposed in Chicago?

11

from the next page that counsel for Celotex was not in

13

14

It is very clear

With respect to what the real holding of the

lower courts appear to agree with the position of

Celotex and not with the position of Respondents about

the position taken by Judge Bork in his dissent.

Aid indeed, in the opinion of

the majority, whether Plaintiff had to produce anything

unless Celotex showed that Plaintiff could never prove

her case, and I think as the Fifth Circuit in Fontaneau

12

said and as Judge Bark said in his dissent, what may

13

have in fact bothered the majority below was the

business about whether Plaintiff needed more time to get

No, but it's indicating that

they, that it can be pat ia admissible form, and at that

15

point, when there's that kind of a solemn representation

16

by counsel on the record, I think that counsel for

assertion.

19

In fact, that never happened in this case.

20

There was never a request for additional time to put it

think, as Judge Bork pointed out, will largely destroy
