ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

Hr. Fmge, I think you

HR. EMGE*

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Courts
This case involves the authority of the United
States district court to issue a preliminary injunction

10

under Section 401(b) of the Communications Act enforcing

11

an FCC rulemaking order on behalf of a private party

12

agaist a state regulatory commission.

13

issue in this case is whether a private party can use

14

the FCC preemption order as a basis for obtaining an

15

injunction from the United States district court which

16

will require a state commission to use a particular

17

ratemaking methodology in establishing intrastate

18

telephone rates.

19

Specifically, the

Our principle argument in support of our

20

contention that the preemption order cannot be enforced

21

by a private party against the Maryland commission is

22

that the preemption is an FCC rulemaking and not an

23

order, and that under Section 401 only FCC orders can be

24

enforced by private parties.

25

QUESTION;

Mr. Emye, with respect to the case

(202) 628-9300

1

that was just argued before your case, will your case be

2

a live case in the event that the Court of Appeals*

3

judgment were, in the earlier case, was reversed and in

4

the case that it was affirmed?

5

MR. EMGEs

The district court order in our

6

case indicates that if the Fourth Circuit decision is

7

reversed that the judgment would be entered in favor of

8

the iafandants in that casa, which is tha Maryland

9

commission.

However, there are numerous cases involving

10

other matters than the preemption order under Section

11

401 enforcement proceedings that have just recently been

12

instituted, and since there is a conflict between the

13

First and the Fourth Circuits on whathar a private party

14

can enforce the preemption -- an FCC rulemaking order —

15

there will be ether instances where the decision will

16

depend upon which circuit you’re in.

17

So although the commission’s decision -- the

18

commission as a defendant will have a jud mant in its

19

favor in the event the preceding case is ruled in favor

20

of the states,

21

remain that will arise in other areas.

there are still conflicts that will

22

If the Court agrees that the preemption order

23

is not the type of FCC decision that can be enforced by

24

a private party, it would ba unnecessary to address or

25

reach the broader question as to whether a state
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 6*o-9300

1

commission is a person and to what extent the state

2

commission is a person for purposes of the

3

Communications Act.
Under the enforcement schema established by

4

5

Congress in Section 401, the FCC has the sole authority

6

to enforce compliance with provisions of the Act, and

7

it’s important to note at this point that in the

8

preemption order the FCC based its decision on the fact

9

that it sail that Section of the Communications Act

10

preempted inconsistent stats depreciation practices.

11

Clearly, enforcement of the preemption order is nothing

12

more than enforcing compliance with the Act,

13

the enforcement scheme established by Congress is

14

Section 401 the TCC and not private parties has the sole

15

authority to determine when and if those violations,

16

such violations, should be enforced.

and under

Under the enforcement scheme in Section 401,

17
18

private parties can only enforce obedience to FCC

19

orders.

20

Section 401(b) to orders, Congress clearly understood

21

that there ware other types of FCC actions that would

22

not be enforceably by private parties under that

23

subsection.

It is clear that by limiting enfor'ement under

It's clear that triere was a distinction, a

25

well known distinction, between what constitutes an

1

agency orler and what constitutes a rule.

2

chose to use the word "order" with respect to the type

3

of actions th&c could be enforced by a private party.

4

Congress

In addition, if Congress had intended private

5

parties to be able to enforce FCC rules, which are the

6

functional equivalent of statutes, the provisions of

7

Section 401(a) would have no meaning.

8

responsibility, once again, for enforcing the compliance

9

with the Act resides only in the FCC.

The sole

The Respondents and their supporting amici

10

11

curiae concede that not all FCC actions are enforceable

12

under Section 401(b).

13

implies in its brief that regulations and rules which

14

are sufficiently general in their terms and

15

applicability may not be enforceable by private parties

16

under Section 401(b).

For example, the Respondent

17

They merely say — allege in this case that

1! 5

the Court doesn't have to reach that because of their

3

position that the preemption order is not one of those

20

orders.

But we submit that if you review the terms and

21

provisions of the preemption order, it clearly is a rule

22

of general applicability and is addressed to a broad

23

group of entities.

24

They seem to indicate, the Respondents that

25

is, that there is a hybrid action called a rulemaking

(202) 628-9300

1

order, and that rulaaafcing orders sash as the preemption

2

order can be enforced by private parties under Section

3

401(b).

4

The first point to be made with respect to

5

that argument is that the fact that the FCC calls the

6

action an order is aider this Court’s decision in CBS

7

not determinative.

8

has done, rather

9

be, that controls.

10

It’s the substance of what the FCC

than what it classifies its actions to

Secondly, if the FCC adopted a rule by an

11

order, it's clear that if that action were to be

12

enforced, it would not be the order adopting the rule

13

that would be enforced, it would be the substance of the

14

rule that would be enforced by the court.

15

you once again get bact to the situation wlere, although

16

the FCC has the sol? responsibility to adopt — to

17

enforce provisions of the Communications Act, a private

18

party under the enforcement scheme suggested by the

19

Respondents would also share that responsibility.

20

So therefore

In order to preserve the enforcement scheme

21

that was established by Congress in Section 401 and

22

thereby maintain the role assigned to the FCC by the

23

Act, enforcement under Section 401(b) must be limited to

24

FCC orders which determine the specific rights and

25

responsibilities of specific individual parties and are

By

the

10

court's role in the enforcement of FCC orders is very

11

limited .

12

So in order for tie federal court's role to be

13

limited, the order that is sought to be enforced must be

14

very specific in what it requires, it must be directed

15

to a specific party,

16

It is a

decision in the preemption order was based upon the fact

2

that it found that the Communications Act# Section 220,

3

preempted the states

4

and that the enforcement of that preemption order is nc

5

different from enforcing compliance with that section cf

6

the Communications Act.

from using inconsistent practices,

There are numerous policy considerations which

7

8

underlie the enforcement scheme that was adopted by

9

Congress and which is set forth in Section 401, and the

10

consideration of these policies indicates that private

11

enforcement of the preemption order is precluded.

12

example, if the goal of promoting the development of

13

uniform, nationwide interstate policy permits the FCC to

14

preempt inconsistent state depreciation practices, then

15

that policy also dictates that the FCC ari not private

16

parties enforce the preemption order under Section

17

401(b).

The cases that have arisen illustrate clearly

that, absent FCC enforcement of the preemption order,

The FCC has argue! that the availability of

I agree that perhaps if the

agency thought about maintaining its prerogatives under

10

the Act, and the prerogative being it has the sole

11

responsibility for enforcing the provisions of the

12

Communications Act, perhaps they would take a different

13

position .

14

But these cases arose and then the FCC came in

15

subsequently in order to deputize the

Now, they argue that they don’t have the

22

resources to enforce all of these actions in 50 states.

23

because in order to maintain uniformity they say they

25

can participate in as many cases as are instituted.

1

It’s difficult to understand how resources will be

2

conserved when the FCC has to intervene in proceedings

3

it may n^t have even chosen to start in the first

4

place.
Instead of choosing to enforce perhaps one or

5
6

two cases, it may find itself faced with ten or 15 cases

7

and being an unwilling participant in these proceedings

8

in order to ensure that its policies are carried out.
QUESTIONS

9

Kay I ask you. Insofar as the

10

proceeding is against the commission itself — and I

11

gather the individual commissioners are sued as well

12

1o you make any Eleventh Amendment argument?
MR. EMGEi

13

tfe have not made an Eleventh

14

Amendment argument, and we're not making one.

15

haven't made one and we wouldn't make one now, because I

16

think the cases are clear, lour Honor, that under

17

Younger, if you name the individuals as defendants, then

18

you avoid any Eleveiti Amendment possibility of

19

problems.

20

3e

And although Younger is mentioned in the

21

Respondent's brief, we have not made any Eleventh

22

Amendment argument is this case.

23

In addition to the conservation of resources

24

of the Federal Communications Commission being a

25

consideration, I think it's also an appropriate
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

consideration to take into account the need to conserve

the resources of the federal courts.

that because its resources are somewhat limited that

The FCC implies

that, for a

may decide that what was alleged to be a violation

So the case may never get

13

Secondly, it requires, as I've indicated

14

previously, the federal courts to delve into state

15

ratemaking orders, which is a very complex and

16

complicated subject.

17

the court's time to determine if the preemption order is

18

in fact being violated by a. rate ord »r of a specific

19

state commission.

20

It will require a great deal of

Moreover, if you permit enforcement of rules

21

that are developed in rulemaking proceedings by private

22

parties against private parties who may not have been a

23

party to the agency proceeding, the district court may

24

be required to again add additional procedures to ensure

25

that the due process rights of a non-party were

protected
If the FCC is required to enforce its own

2

3

orders., such procedures would not be necessary and the

4

court could function, as Congress had intended, in a

5

very narrow way, looking to see if there was — the

6

order was regularly made and duly certified,

7

its inquiry to the matters of that nature.

8

Finally, by allowing the Federal

9

limiting

Communications Commission to delegate the enforcement to

10

private parties, you will end up with a significant

11

amount of issue splitting, cases being — part of a rate

12

case being tried in a federal court, part of a rata case

13

being decided in a state court* consequently the

14

resources of both the parties and the courts will not be

15

conserved.

16

For these reasons,

we believe that the

17

decision of the Circuit Court for the First Circuit

18

properly articulates the policies underlying the

19

enforcement scheme that Congress chose to adopt with

20

respect to Section 431 of the Communications Act.

21

Consequently, we would submit that the preemption order

22

is not an FCC order which can be enforced by a private

23

party in federal district court under Section 401(b).

Thank you.

First of all with respect to the term

13
14

"person," it is a fundamental principle of statutory

15

construction that when trying to determine the meaning,

16

of a word we should look to its plain meaning as the

damages that I would have a severe Eleventh Amendment
problem.

10

In this particular case, under this Court's

11
12

holding in Ex Parte Young, et cetera, I am looking only

13

for injunctive relief, and I am suing them in their

14

individual capacities.
QUESTION*

15

Well, my questions really are not

16

intended to raise tie Eleventh Amendment problem, but

17

the statutory definition that you referred to of

18

"person" doss not include official commissions as an

19

example of a commission, and there is a separate -- I

20

mean of a person.

.

21

22
23

And there is a separate statutory definition
of the term "state commission," isn't there?
MR. STROUD*

24

does not include them.

25

them as well.

You are right, Your Honor, it
However, it does not exclude

And indeed, there is a separate section
18

(202) 628-9300

1

which defines state commissions.

2

not an unusual problem, and if you look at cases which

3

have been decided by this Court and which I rtxer to in

4

my papers, including Ceorgi* v. Evans, Simmons v.

5

Ohio v. Helvering, you will see that in a number, a

6

variety of different statutory contexts, you see the

7

term "person" and you have "state" defined separately

8

somewhere else in that statute.

But of course, that is

U.S.,

9

In each of the cases that I have quoted to

10

you, the term "person" has been construed to include

11

state, even though there’s a separate definition in the

12

statute for the word "state."

13

case law that is not cited by the Petitioner in this

14

case.

And that of course is

Now, Petitioner argues that -- well, I'd like

15
16

to, before I go back to get to the policy questions, I’d

17

like to make another point with respect to the

18

definitional section.

19

and the words that Congress used, it said in connection

20

with the definition of the term "person” that "the

21

definition includes."

22

means.

23

If yo i look at the Section 153(i)

It didn’t say that the definition

It says that "the definition includes."
And it suggests there, we contend,

that the

24

entities enumerated in the definition are only

25

illustrative of the types of entities which could be
19
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

included there.

And indeed, I believe the Petitioner in

2

this rise concedes that point.
The only argument that the Petitioner makes is

3
4

that there has to be some common denominator# some

5

common thread between the entities that are included and

6

those which are sought to be included within the

7

definition.
That argument, we would suggest. Your Honors,

8
9

is not an argument based on law.

In fact, the law is

10

different.

11

rules for determining exclusion or inclusion, and what

12

you really have to 3o is to look to the legislative

13

context.

14

It says that there are no hard and fast

If you look at the cases that I've just

15

referred to — Seorgia v. E/ans, Simmons v. U.S., et

16

cetera — you would see that the controlling factor is

17

the legislative context.

18
19

20
21

Those statutes have exactly

.he same kinds of provisions which are set forth in the
'Communications Act, and this Court has consistently
construed "persons'’ to include states.
The policy arguments that Petitioner offers in

22

support if his definition of the term "person" are not

23

persuasive.

24

be excluded from the definition of the term "persons"

25

because or in deference to what he claims to be a

First of all, he argues that states should

(202) 628-9300

federal policy of deference to the states,

2

argue, Justices, that that policy position is incorrect,

3

and indeed we would cite the Court to the lai.yuage of

4

the Fourth Circuit wherein it said that even if the

5

individual commissioners themselves were not persons,

6

that the court would- nevertheless find that states were

7

included within the definition of the term "persons"

8

because to do otherwise would be to completely undermine

9

the 1934 Communications Act.
How would that happen?

10

We would

Well, if you look back

11

to the legislative history of the 1334 Act, if you look

12

even to the letter from President Roosevelt to Sam

13

Rayburn, you sea that at that time the communications

14

policy in this country was in chaos.

15

distributed between the interstate Commerce Commission,

16

between the Postmastar General's Office, and between the

17

Radio Commission.
And ii

18

The policy was

that letter to Congress, the President

19

asked that Congress pull this all together and put it

20

under one agency, so that we could have a unified

21

communications policy and a system of regulation in this

22

country.

23

the FCC, the recipient of this authority and

24

which has the responsibility for implementing national

25

and international communications policy, that power

And indeed, courts have held that the power of
the agency

extends to all regulatory actions necessary to ensure

2

achievement of the commission's statutory

3

responsibilities .

4

And

we would argue

that that policy

5

responsibility would not be achieved in indeed the

6

states were excluded from the definition of the term

7

"person."

8

imagine an event in which the states were evading lawful

9

orders of the FCC and

If such a result occurred, one could readily

the FCC would be powerless under

10

the Act to seek enforcement of those orders, even the

11

adjudicatory kinds of orders to which Petitioner

12

refers.

13

And we would argue that if the Congress

14

intended that after the FCC issued an order against a

15

commission like the Maryland commission, if Congress

16

intended that it had to go to Anne Arundel County or

17

some other circuit court in order to get that order

18

enforced, that it would have said so, and indeed it did

19

not say so.

20

Now, «hat other language do we have in the

21

statute to suggest what Congress intended with respect

22

to the word "person," whether they intended that states

23

be included within that definition.

24

and correctly so, that Section 401(b) is in fact based

25

upon Section 1612 of the Interstate Commerce Act,

It has been argued,

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

and

1

there is no real dispute about that.
But if you look back at that statute, if you

3

look back at Section 1512, you see that th^ Section

section.

6

Section 401(b), under the old 1612 that word was

7

"carrier."

Everywhere you see

the word "person" in

So that wien 401(b) was enacted, the word was

8
9

was not copied directly after that statutory

changed from "carrier" to "person."

In looking at the

10

legislative history, there is no explanation for this

11

change.

12

fact that Congress changed that word, and certainly in

13

'•iew of the fact that the term "person" is broader than

14

the term "carrier," and in view of the obvious fact that

15

the three principle players in this scheme of regulation

16

are tha state commissions, the FCC, and the carriers,

17

that the reason Congress changed that word from

18

"carriers" to "persons" was to make it broa'

19

include states like the Petitioner in this case.

20

I would now like to turn to the second

However, we would argue that, in view of the

enough to

21

argument that has been made by the Petitioner in this

22

case, and that is that the preemption order is in fact

23

not an order within the mealing of faction 401(b).

24

the reason that argument is advanced is because

25

Petitioners argue that an order generated from an

2

generated in a rulemaking proceeding.

3

adjudicatory orders are enforceable, rulemaking orders

4

are not enforceable under Section 401(b).

5

They argue that

Moreover, they argue that the preemption order

6

in this case was a product of a rulemaking proceeding

7

and therefore is not enforceable.

8

9

Me would argue. Justices, that Petitioner's
claim on this point is totally without merit .

Moreover,

10

if that position were adopted, prompt enforcement of FCC

11

orders would be impossible.

12

at this juncture that this is not the position that the

13

Petitioners took before the district court.

14

And I might also point out

There seemed to be little doubt in that

15

16

argument about adjudicatory orders, enforceable orders,

17

is one that was raised for the first time before the

things.
First of all, it is true that the

11
12

Administrative Procedure Act does contain a definitional

13

section and it does contain a definition of the word

14

"order,” and "orders" under that section would exclude

15

rulemaking orders.
I would point out,

16

however, that the

17

Administrative Procedure Act has no relevance cf

18

application whatsoever to the 1934 Commun_cations Act.

19

The Administrative Procedure Act was passed more that

20

ten years after the 1934 Act.
Moreover, if you look at the definitions set

21

22

forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, you see that

23

those definitions are expressly limited to the Act

24

itself.

for believing that you should engraft onto the 1934 Act

2

definitions which iijra not considered by Congress until

3

ten years later.

4

In addition to ignoring the plain language of

5

the statute and the legislative history, the Petitioner

6

in this case has already — also ignored a number of

7

cases by this Court which indicates that orders which

8

are the product of rulemaking are indeed enforceable.

9

And in that regard — this regard, I would cite to the

10

Court the case of Ambassador v.

There may be some orders which are so — which

MR. SMITH*

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Courts

6

Congress intended Section 401(d) of the Act as

7

a broad enforcement mechanism, available both to parties

8

injured by violations of the Act and to the FCC itself.

9

The section fairly bristles with the word "any."

It

10

says that if any person violates any provision of the

11

Communications Act, the FCC or any party injured thereby

12

may appeal to the appropriate district court for

13

enforcement of such order.

14

Yet Petitioner reads this broad language very

15

narrowly, in a mannar that vould have this Court exclude

16

a significant class of potential violators and a large

17

category of FCC ordars.

18

legal precedent, or common sense supports that result.

19

Neither the statutory language,

broadness and inclusiveness of Section 3(i) of the Act.

has never, at least to my knowledge, ruled that a person

does not include a state or a state commission.

ON BEHALF CF PETITIONED

19

MR. EMGE;

Just briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.

20

The Respondent in its brief and in the

argument today places a great deal of reliance on the

Court’s decision in the CBS case.

23

absolutely no remedy.
Here we’re not talking about reviewability.

8
9

We're talking about enforceability and who can enforce

10

the Act.

I think the policy considerations that we

11

outlined in our brief and I outlined earlier in my

12

argument clearly distinguisi

13

of whether an order can be enforced from the question of

14

whether an order is subject to judicial review.

15

Contrary -- secondly, contrary to the FCC’s

16

assertion, I think it's clear that enforcement of the

to adopt the telephone company’s proposals as to what

The problems are still there, even in the
