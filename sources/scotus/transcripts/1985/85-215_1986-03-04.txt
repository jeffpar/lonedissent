ORAL ARGUMENT OF LEONARD N.

SOSNOV, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

5

MR. SOSNOVi

7

Mr. Sosnov, you may

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
The principal issue before this Court is

8
9

whether Pennsylvania's Mandatory Sentencing Act violates

10

due process of law because it provides for proof by only

11

a preponderance of the evidence of the legislatively

12

specified defense-related facts which require the

13

imposition of a mandatory sentence of imprisonment.
The Mandatory Act provides that if a defendant

14
15

is convicted of one of the numerated list of felonies,

16

the Commonwealth may give notice of its intension to

17

proceed under that act rather than Pennsylvania's

18

discretionary sentencing scheme.

Do you suggest that that

provision goes to anything other than the sentence, the

21

penalty?

MR. SOSNOV;

MR. SOS NOV:

No.

As i matter of fact, as to

three of the four defendants» under the discretionary

3

sentencing scheme, tie sentence of five to ten years in

4

prison mandated by this act is the maximum for that

offense, and for one of

What they have lost, of course, under a scheme

8

like this is they ha/e lost the opportunity for a much

lesser sentence, and there's nothing wrong with a state

10

having a mandatory sentencing act.

How would they — how would they

12

get that, by proving that there was no firearm

involved ?

20

KR. S0SN0V*

Any defendant would be free in

22

the question here I believe is what burden of proof the

23

state has to meet to provide for a more severe

24

punishment.

25

In effect here, what Pennsylvania has done is

felonies.

Right now, aggravated

assault, for example, carries one punishment while

3

aggravated assault with a firearm carries a more severe

4

punishment.

That is exactly what has been done hare.

I have set it forth in a table in my reply

brief.

The penalties are vastly different now for

7

whether you commit an offense with a firearm or without

a firearm.

Hell, Nr. Sosnov, you take the

position that the due process clause requires the

11

invalidation of this scheme,

HR. SOSNOV*

right?

That is correct.
Hhat is the defendant were to be

sentenced by a judge who simply takes the position that

Is that a violation

scheme, Justice O’Connor?

The essential difference between a

is it is nothing li<e these other sentencing schemes.

It is simply like a trial.

If In fact in a situation like this the

is permitted to do this, Pennsylvania and New Jersey,

aside from tha whole trend of our jurisprudence, there

16

is really no place to draw the constitutional line
