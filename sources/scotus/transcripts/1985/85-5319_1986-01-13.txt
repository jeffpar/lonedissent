ORAL ARGUMENT OF'ROBERT A. HARPER, JR., ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. HARPER*

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, the prosecutor's closing

10

argument in the Millie Jasper Darden prosecution during

11

the final summary has been variously described as bad, as

12

unfair, as harmful,

13

there is one word only that is sufficient to describe

14

this argument in this case,

15

as prejudicial, as egregious, but

and that is reversal.

^he question then arises as to why the case

16

hasn't been reversal and why is it here.

17

answer is, the Eleventh Circuit has not and did not apply

18

the appropriate standard announced in Caldwell versus

19

Mississippi.

20

And the simple

On the same date that the Darden case came down

21

en banc from the Eleventh Circuit, July the 23rd, 198B,

22

that court decided Tucker versus Kemp, Brooks v. Kemp,

23

and William Tucker versus Kemp.

raised Caldwell in the petition for rehearing which was

It is so bad, as the District Judge noted,

submit that this case would be universally

applauded by the organized bar, and no concept should be

indulged to deflect from the fact that the sentencer in

16

The purpose of the Code of Professional

17

Responsibility is universally accepted by every

18

practicing attorney and judge.

19

is to protect the due process rights to a fair trial.

20

These standards are objective, and we submit that these

21

standards are the litmus against which this prosecutor’s

22

argument should be tested,

QUESTION;

9

This crime was committed on

1973.

impermissible for a lawyer in the courtroom to criticize

the system of justice that lets this kind of a matter run

As far as this trial, this proceeding dragging

23

on this long, if that is the question you are putting to

In this case, Willie Jasper Darden, he will not

1

2

die because o* these rights he has, and these rights we

3

have been asserting the last eight years that I have been

4

wor'tina on this rase pro bono have been, reevaluated at

5

least three times by this Court.

6

All three issues we have filed have been

7

reevaluated,

and the only thing that has changed in

8

Willie Darden’s case is not the facts, but the way we

9

have had to plead in ours, and the way we have had to try

10

to get the courts below to apply the standards that you

11

have set out.
Our case has been, I think, very active, and it

12
13

was visited by the en banc Eleventh Circuit four times.
QUESTION*

14
15

Did you say it is the third time it

has been here?
MR. FARPERs

16

Yes,

sir.

Yes, sir, it is the

17

third time here, but I think it is appropriate to say

18

that the issues are more ripe now.

19

certain findings below, and the District Judoe made

20

findings below that make things ripe in the sense of

21

this.

22

that are important by the judge below which are now

23

reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and I think

24

those findings, those ■‘■ypes of things solidify the rights

25

of Willie Darden to the relief that we are requesting.
