and I think it is safe to say that the court had that

evidence and that contention firmly in mind at the

11

with the court the claim that the

The court had refused any evidence or any

time.
This Court has held in Sistaino versus Foss

12

that these kinds of claims are to be adjudicated

13

essentially on a case by case analysis in which the

14

question is whether there arc special circumstances

15

about the crime that cause one to believe that there

16

a need for such voir dire.

17

Is

One of our points is that the special

18

circumstances need not be the facts of the case,

the

19

facts of the crime or the murder as much as they may

20

also include the facts surrounding the prosecutions,

21

such as in this case,

the prosecution is being conducted,

have addressed all of these issues fully in

3
4

our briefs, which we incorporate into this argument by

reference, but I would like to address one thing in

6

particular in this argument that we have not'really

/

focused on before.

That is exactly the scope of a rule

8

that we would suggest that this Court could cr should

9

make in such a case.

10

Mow, there is in this Court's jurisprudence on

11

voir dire issues a tension between the virtue of clarity

12

on the one hand that comes with pec se rules and on the

13

other hand the flexibility that comes with the

14

discretionary approach or leaving it all to the

15

discretion of the trial court.

You could continue to rely on Ristaino versus

clear that the discretion must be exercised in a capital

the degree of discretion that you found and noted in

Zant versus Stevens applies absolutely in this case as

well.

13

And the second thing that is important about

14

capital cases is the possibility that racial prejudice

15

will manifest itself in tie death and life decision,

16

for that we have suggested that the history of racial

17

discrimination and the history of the discriminatory

18

application in this country is evidence if rot

necessarily evidence high enough to allow us to argue to

you that the entire statutory scheme should be

I am asking you a hypothetical

Because the question you are

putting may answer the other question.
MR. SNOOK:

13

I understand.

My position is that

14

you could draw a very narrow rule recognizing the

15

problem of black and white relationships in this

16

country .

17

QUESTION:

How about Hispanics then?

And, of

18

course, Puerto Rican may be categorized as Hispanic

19

under some circumstances.

20

MR. SNOOK:

Well,

I think that there you could

21

again fall back on the case by case sort of analysis,

22

and I don't think it is necessarily wrong to say that in

23

a case where — for example, let us suppose that we are

24

in a place in Texas in which there is a greater history

25

of discrimination against people with Spanish surnames.

If we are in a place like that, where there is some

2

history of discrimination, that may be more of a

problem.

perspective,

very few indeed Hispanics, and so we don't perceive

there being a problem of discrimination against

QUESTION;

12

Ur. Snook, in your submission a

13

moment ago you said that in your view the Court could

retain, I thought you said,

Ristaino against Ross, which leaves it largely to the

discretion of the trial court informed by the facts cf

particular case the fact that not just the trinx and the

5

judge who was conducting the voir dire and counsel also

6

were going to a jurisdiction with which they were not

familiar in this instance.

to the trial judge is that that discretion is informed

MR. SNOOK;

5

QUESTION;

MR. SNOOK;

QUESTION;

In fact the Chesapeake Bay is in

12

MR. SNOOK;

13

That’s right, the Chesapeake Bay

14

is the bigger problem, because we are -- you have to gc

15

across the Chesapeake Bay,

16

say that the eastern shore is considerably isolated from

17

the rest of the state, and Justice Powell, I am sure, is

18

familiar with the geographical problems that we have an

this state in integrating the eastern shore into the

are in real trouble.

So, in this case all that we are

saying is that there may be a continuum, a spectrum, if
you will, of justifiable and supportable constitutional
rules going from the — still adhering to the case by
case analysis in Ristaino versus Ross all the way over
to a bright line rale that says in every single capital
case in every state in the union there must be such voir

What you coul do is

2

to say all that is necessary is that cne way or another,

3

either the state courts adopt a per se rule or they

4

adopt a discretionary rule that takes these ether

5

factors into consideration,

6

no time in this case did we ever get up to that level,

7

because the court never considered any circumstances

8

surrounding the proper voir dire in this case.

but the problem is that at

12

to say every capital case in which the jury does the

13

sentencing, ar'1 of course there are about seven states

14

in which the death sentence is imposed where it is

15

really a judge sentencing state, Alabara being one,

17

which this same rule might not apply.

18

One would be every capital

A second might be — a more limited one would be

Those are states in

Or down to the rise of every capital rase in a

19

state where the jury has essentially unfettered'

20

discretion, as in Georgia, as in Virginia.

21

consider simply the fact of every jury sentencing case,

22

which would be a broader rule that would apply obviously

23

not only to capital cases, but would apply to

24

non-capital cases in those seven states that still have

25

jury sentencing.

You can also

(202) 628-9300

1

But again, you don't have to adept any one of

2

those per se rules.

What you might well do is simply

3

decide that the states must as a matter of

4

constitutional law either adopt a per se rule that

5

considers these facts or must adopt a discretion based

6

rule that considers these facts, but that in either

7

event you must consider the unique characteristics of

8

the capital sentence.

MR. SNOOK;

What are the guidelines for the

The exercise of the judge's

discretion is what -- well.

would have that would make that decision and that

exercise of discretion better informed.

(202) 628-9300

1

the racial prejudice that was a problem in that case was

2

one of the reasons -- was one of the factors to take
into account, and therefore

that the judge,

having

4

failed to take those factors into account, abused his

5

discetion in not having asked those questions.
But all we are saying is that at a bare

6
7

minimum, the bare mandatory minimum that this Court

8

should require is that the trial judge consider the

9

unique needs of a rapital case.
QUESTION;

10

Well, would you require him to put

11

something on the record reciting that he had considered

QUESTION;

Would you require it as a matter of

federal constitutional law?
MR. SNOOK;

I think that if it is to be

18

considered as an exercise of discretion, that yes, it

19

would have to be — either he would have to say,

20

have considered these factors, or would have to give

21

some othe indication some place that he is not simply

22

ruling out of his hip pocket.

Sr. Snook, your argument strikes

17

me, frankly, as asking for almost a cosmetic change

18

which would have the effect of overturning a conviction

19

for failure tc meet it. The judge did ask of the panel

20

if there was any reason whatever why the jurors could

21

not serve properly in this case, and presumably the

22

panel didn't indicate or no one indicated they could

23

not, and you would be satisfied with a single additional

question posed to the entire panel, are any of you

racially biased?

how much do we gain by that kind

is the fact that at the very least if there are honest

those jurors will say yes.

10

QUESTION:

as we assume that there are, that

If there are honest jurors on the

11

panel who felt they were racially biased, they should

12

have said yes in response to the more general question,

13

shouldn’t they?

14

MR. SNOOK:

I don't think so, Your Hcnor,

15

because the mere general question does not call their

16

attention to the fact that the victim was white.

17

we all know that as a practical matter, what often

18

happens in capital cases is that the jury considers in

19

some way or another the relative worth of the life of

20

the defendant against the relative worth of the life of

21

the man he killed, and it is unfortunately the case that

22

all too often people, blacks, when the blakcs are the

23

victims, for whatever reason, the death penalty does not

24

get applied.

25

research that has been dene that that is based in large

account.
Nov, I have to assume dgain that asking the

question would have some utility, first of all, because

5

I assume that they are honest jurors, second, because at

the very least they would begin to think about the

Court of Virginia has apparently done, to the defendant

12

for introducing this study on the basis of shewing that

13

white victims, defendants who kill white victims are

14

more frequently executed, we submit that the study is

15

insufficient.

But since this Court handed down the decisions

in Gregg, Jurek, and Proffitt, states do not have the

submit, has on? of the more stringent statutes in the

2

country, because not only has Virginia seen fit to

3

narrow the categories of crimes for which a death

4

penalty may be imposed, and it is related to all of the

5

capital murder crimes, had' to be wilfull, premeditated,

6

and deliberate murders.

7

In Virginia, unlike Texas and Florida and

8

Georgia, Virginia cannot use a felony murder rule in

9

capital cases.

In addition to having to show the

10

premeditation and wilfull, deliberate murder, it has to

11

be in connection with some other aggravating

12

circumstance such as during the commission of rape or in

13

this case during the commission of armed robbery.

14

But not only does the Commonwealth bear the

burden of showing those stringent circumstances.

A

So, we submit that the statute in Virginia is

21

much more stringent than the statutes in other states,

22

and that Virginia should be viewed upon hew it is

23

imposing capital murder, not perhaps what they are doing

24

in Georgia or some other place.

25

The studies, as we have indicated in our

Each of the

studies, the Powers and Pierce study, which was

and Morrow which was introduced, I think, during the

Federal District Court proceeding on a motion to alter

or amend, those studies ta*e all homicides committed in

7

a state and try to compare those with cases in which the

sentence was actually imposed.

9

Under Virginia law, for example, they are

comparing or would try to be comparing in Gross and

11

Morrow's study, they would be trying to compare capital

murder cases with manslaughter cases, with second degree

murder cases, with first degree murder cases, all of

when that was offered?
MR. KULP;

I think the position, and I didn’t

try the case, but I believe the position was that it

21

does not accurately reflect how capital punishment is

22

raised or is being imposed in the Commonwealth of

Virginia, and the District Court found that as a matter

of law, the statistics were not acceptable.

presumably they real! see that it was a black defendant,

MR. KULPs

6

Justice O'Connor, it is true that

in this case

the jury when they were asked these

8

questions did not know the race of the defendant -- or

9

the victim, and as a matter of fact, all daring the case

10

neither the prosecutor nor the defendant ever made

11

anything of race either of the defendant or the victim,

12

and it wasn't until about the second or third day of

13

trial when the prosecutor introduced a photograph of the

14

body that the jurors virtually became aware that he was

15

white.

16

by the prosecutor or even in the defendant's case that

17

he was white .

So, there was never an 7 issue made to the jury

Now, it seems that

submit that this is certainly a clear indication that

22

when they know the race of the defendant, that is where

23

the bias, if any there is, would come into play, and

24

since in Ristaino one of the jurors admitted to racial

bais, we think that the general question then would draw

out from a juror who is going to be honest, and we

submit that the asking cf the additional question --

3

there is nothing to indicate that a juror, if they were

questions and they didn't answer in the affirmative,

there is nothing to really indicate that they would

13

factual issues that a jury must focus upon in order to

14

find that a person is subject to capital punishment.

15

This is, it appears to me, much like in
In other words, there are certain

Now, this Court in the past, while it has

16

recognized the qualitative different nature of death

17

sentences, has never gone and taken the step cf carving

18

out a separate and distinct series of laws to apply to

capital cases.

20

this Court said that there is no reason not to apply the

21

normal rules cf evidence as to using an expert*.

22

For example, in Barefoot versus Estelle,

The Court applies the same standard in capital

23

and noncapital cases in Strickland versus Washington,

apply the same standard whether you are talking about a

capital case or a noncapital case.

4

And we submit that there have been no

persuasive reasons presented to this Court which would

justify a step as saying that simply because it is a

questions.

He was simply

following what I believe was the law which was set down
by this Court in Ristaino only three years before ha
ruled in this case.
And we would ask the Court in this — for
example, the death penalty in Virginia has only been
under the new statute
1985, June of 1985,

since

1977, and between 1977 and

there have only been 212 people

charged with capital murder in the State of Virginia.
The petitioner indicates in his petition that there are
32 people on death row in Virginia, which wculd leave us
then 190 people who have been charged with capital
murder who have had some disposition other than the
death sentence,

And the prosecutor then was urging

the death penalty?

Is that in the record?

No, sir.

The point I am trying to

say is that the studies which we think are fundamentally

flawed because the raw materials or the raw data that

they use do not reflect how capital punishment is being

imposed in Virginia, and so we just ran a survey of all

11

the prosecutors to just find out, and so we are

confident that if they compared capital cases or persons

who were charged with capital murder, that these studies

14

would not indicate,
