MS KUHLi

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;

12

court, ani this issue requires the Court to consider yet

2

again the requirements of Section 405-G of Title 42,

3

jurisdictional provision for review of Social Security

4

benefit claims.

5

Before getting into the merits of the

6

argument, I would Like to clarify just how the

7

provisions in question work , because the terminology

10

QUESTION*

11

SS KUHLs

12

A

That's a marvelous understatement.
Thank you. Justice White.

I thought

that was almost the hariast part of this case.

13

A wage earner is entitled to have his or her

14

family receive certain types of benefits based on the

15

wage earner's

16

involved here are called survivors benefits, and that

17

means that they are benefits paid to certain members of

18

the wage earner’s family because the wage earner has

19

died.

20

earnings attempt.

The typa of benefits

Now, the wage earner’s widow or the wage

21

earner’s widower receives benefits after the wage

22

earner's death, and

23

surviving widowed spouse benefits, and they come rather

24

automatically.

25

dependent for purposes of the Act.

they — these benefits are called

That is, the spouse is presumed to be

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

If the wage earner, however, was divorced

2

before he or she dies,

the wage earner's former spouse

3

receives benefits after the wage earner's death if the

4

marriage between the wage earner and the former spouse

5

lasted at least ten years, and these types of benefits

6

are called surviving divorced spouse benefits.

7

Although the rule used to be that survivors*

8

benefits terminated upon remarriage of the spouse, and

9

this was called the remarriage rule, in 1977 Congress

10

eliminated this remarriage rule for widowed spouses over

11

the age of 60, but all other survivors* benefits still

12

continued to terminate on remarriage, and this was true

13

not only for divorced spouses' benefits but also for

14

benefits to dependent parents of the wage earner and

15

dependent children of the <*age earner.

16

So, in 1977 Congress made a distinction for

17

purposes of widows and widowers but it still kept in

18

another category not only the divorced spouses but also

19

the dependent children and dependent parents.

20

There ace three basic reasons why the step

21

Congress took in 1977 has a rational basis.

22

Congress has always treated married spouses different

23

from divorced spouses, both because the entire structure

24

of the Act is based on the family unit, and because

25

Congress has assume! that divorced spouses depend less

First,

on each other for economic support than do couples who

2

stay married.

3

It was rational for Congress to recognize

4

these differences between married and divorced spouses

5

on the event cf remarriage because —

treated them differently.

Is that correct?

I believe it is,

Justice Blackmun,

10

QUESTION;

11

MS KUHLs

What about prior to 1977?
Prior to 1977, yes, they were

12

treated differently because initially, of course, widows

13

and widowers — well,

14

benefits and divorced spouses were not getting benefits

15

at all, and then Congress permitted divorced spouses tc

16

get benefits, but that divorced spouses had to be

17

married for 20 years and to meet certain criteria of

18

dependency before they could get benefits.

widows at least were getting

So, in other words they were treated

19

20

differently because Congress had a dependency test all

21

along with regard to divorced spouses but it did not

22

have a dependency test with regard to widows and

23

widows rs.

24
25

To briefly, then,

state the second reason why

— the second rational basis for Congress's action here,

(202) 628-9300

1

when Congress permitted some divorced spouses to receive

2

benefits, Congress created a situation where there was a

3

potential for two spouses to be receiving -- one, a

4

current spouse and one a former spouse, to be receiving

5

benefits at the same time based on the one wage earner’s

6

account, and it was —

10

What

They had always been treated

11

differently, both because there were different

assumptions about dependency of divorced spouses, and

because there was a -- the whole system is based on the

family unit.

NS KUHL*

No, it wasn't, because of the -How can you say that?
Well, first of all, this Court has,

6

I believe in Califano versus Jobst, there's sort of a

7

chronology that the Court follows through in its

8

opinion, but the way this ten-year test evolved, the way

9

it evolved was, as I mentioned previously, there were no

10

benefits for surviving — for divorced spouses, and then

11

Congress had a two-pronged test of dependency.

12

The reason was because they were concerned

13

about women in particular who had been married to a wage

14

earner for a long period of time with perhaps having nc

15

job themselves and th jn were divorced, so the criteria

16

that Congress set up were,

17

years and number two, some — a more specific dependency

18

test that had to do Kith whether the di/orced spouse was

19

receiving alimony while the wage earner was still alive.

20

number one, marriage for 20

Then, I believe in 1972, and again this is

21

recounted in the Jobst opinion. Congress became a little

22

bit concerned about the more specific criteria of

23

dependency because Congress realized that there were

24

states that did not permit alimony under state law.

25

so, in response to that problem, Congress said,

all

And

1

right, we’ll be even more broadly inclusive and we won’t

2

have the specific criteria of dependency but've'll

3

continue in effect the 20-yeac marriage requirement,

4

subsequently reduced tc a ten-year marriage requirement.

5

If the test

— I think if the test was, was it

really a sham marriage, it would be a much shorter

period of time.

QUESTION^

As between the divorced spouse who

satisfied the ten-year period, and the widow, no
differ ence?
MS KUHLi

So, not as of 1977, with regard to

12

survivors’ benefits.

13

footnote 2 of our reply brief, divorced spouses were

14

still being treated differently for other purposes; that

15

is, with regard to what are called spouses’ benefits

16

which are benefits that a divorced spouse might receive

17

when the wage earner is still alive, the remarriage rule

18

continued, even after

19

Congress in 1977 was treating divorced spouses more

20

alike and widowed spouses more alike.

21

But as we know, and I believe it's

1977.

So that, in essence,

Before discussing these points in a little bit

22

more detail and going ever two more of the rational

23

bases on which Congress acted, I'd like to say a word

24

about the legal standard to be applied in judging the

25

constitutionality of Congress’s actions here.

1

It seems clear that the standard should be the

2

rational basis test,

3

fact applied the rational basis test.

4

the Social Security Act, this Court has measured

5

classifications based cn divorce, in Matthews versus De

6

Castro, and based on remarriage in Califano versus

7

Jobst, according to a rational basis test,

8

no reason to do otherwise here.

9

The test,

and district court in this case in
In the context cf

and there’s

then, is simply whether Congress’s

10

action can be said to manifest a patently arbitrary

11

classification utterly lacking in rational

12

justification, and I think the district court’s error in

13

applying this test is fairly easy to pinpoint, and it

14

goes to the rationale that we have been discussing

15

previously, rationale cf differences in dependency

16

between divorced spouses and widowed spouses.

17

The district court seemed to believe that when

18

Congress gave survivors’ benefits to divorced spouses,

19

it committed itself to the position that there was no

20

basis whatsoever for 44-Stinguishing between divorced

21

spouses and widowed spouses.

22

But what the district court failed to

23

recognize is what I’ve stated previously, that Congress

24

has always treated,

25

and widowed spouses differently, and the fact that

even in 1377,

has treated divorced

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHirtu TON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Congress chose to treat them the same for purposes cf

2

initial eligibility for survivors* benefits dees not

3

mean that Congress was requiring them to treat them the

4

same for all purposes. It was rational for Congress to

5

give effect to he differences between the two groups at

6

the time of remarriage.

7

I’ve discussed previously in answer to

8

questions the chronology of Congress's first giving no

9

benefits to divorced spouses, thereby recognizing the

10

reality of the legal severance of relationship at the

11

time of divorce, and then giving benefits to divorced

12

spouses but using two criteria of dependency, 20-year

13

duration marriage requirement plus some more specific

14

criteria, and Congress then being concerned that the

15

more specific criteria were not working well and

16

retaining only the 20-year marriage requirement and then

17

reducing the 20-yeac marriage requirement to a ten-year

18

marriage requirement but still retaining that as a

19

criteria of dependency.

20

But all of this suggests that the differences

21

between divorced spouses and widowed spouses have been

22

at least as apparent to Congress as their similarities.

23

Thus,

24

ended survivors’ benefits on remarriage, and when

25

Congress chose as it did to proceed a step at a time

when Congress considered changing the rule that

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

with regard to the elimination of this remarriage rule»

2

Congress acted quite reasonably in eliminating te

3

remarriage rule» first for the one category of

4

beneficiaries for whom there had never been a dependency

5

test, and that was widows and widowers.

6

Congress at the same time then continued, in

7

effect, the remarriage rule for all other categories of

8

beneficiaries, those categories being categories where

9

there were dependency tests attached which was, as I've

10

stated, not only the surviving divorced spouses but also

11

dependent parents for whom there was a dependency test,

12

and dependent children for whom there is a dependency

13

t est.

14

Put another way. Congress could rationally

15

assume that its concerns that had been manifested in

16

prior legislation about divorced spouses who had not

17

worked during the years when they were married, could be

18

set aside on the avent of the remarriage of the divorced

19

spouse.

20

I would like to briefly mention two other

21

things that can be said about the rationality of the

22

distinction that Congress chose here in 1977.

23

all, as I have alluded to very briefly earlier, when a

24

divorced spouse receives survivors' benefits there is a

25

possibility that another spouse may also be receiving

First of

1

benefits based on the one w age earner’s account,

2

Benefits to divorced spouse s are not counted against the

3

ceiling amount that may be paid based on one single wage

4

earner’s account.

5

Thus# Congress’s decision to pay benefits to

6

divorced spouses creates th e potential for — and I

7

don’t mean this pejorativel y but just descriptively —

8

as sort of a double dipping based on the one wage

9

earner’s account, and

10
11

this is a special kind of drain on

the trust fund.
QUESTION*

12

situation where the widow’s benefit -- could the

best to find by the situati on of looking where there’s

24

been a divorce.

25

MS KUHLi

Both categories?
That, I think, is a better rational

classification.

Of course we don't have to — I think

6

the Court does not have to look to whether it's better

7

or not, but I think it's a rational classification to

8

look to the situation wher-a there has been a divorce

because I think that even creates the probability, not

10

the certainty but the probability, of this,

what I've

called double dipping.

Well, first of all I do not believe
15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

J

1

that the rational basis test requires us to discern

2

Congress's actual motivation, so long as Congress could

3

have rationally acted with this purpose, and in this

4

case, first of all, I think as to dependency. Congress's

5

purpose can be discerned from the progress of its

6

concerns over the years with regard to widowed spouses.

7

With regard to its fiscal concerns, what we

8

have is kind cf — is the progress of the legislation

9

itself.

The House would have eliminated the remarriage

10

rule entirely and the legislative history indicates that

11

that would have cost pi.3 billion per year.

12

The Cenate bill had no provision in it with

13

regard to the marriage rule.

14

QUESTIONi

Well,

I take it you're saying,

15

although you are hesitant to express it, that there is

16

nothing in so many words in the legislative history.

17

You have to speculate on the fiscal considerations and

18

what Congress might have done.

19

is very spars =..

20

MS KUHLi

lha lagislative history

Well, yes, it is.

There is a House

21

Committee report.

The Senate did not consider the

22

issue, and the Conference Committee acted really without

23

an explanation in the conference report, but this Court

24

has never held that an actual motivation must be

25

discerned in order for the Court to find that Congress

QUESTION:

2S XUHL:

I’m not certain.

10

In sum, to just draw a conclusion with regard

11

to this fiscal concern, I think that the appellees have

12

agreed that the — by choosing the categories that it

13

did in 1977, Congress saved about $17 million per year

14

and this Court should be unwilling to assume that $17

15

million per year is simply too little for Congress

16

rationally to be concerned about.

17

The second issue in this case relates to the

18

class definition.

19

jurisdiction over two groups of individuals that it

20

purported to include in the class.

21

jurisdiction over persons who did not exhaust their

22

administrative remedies, and second, it lacked

23

jurisdiction over parsons whose claims had already

to draw the

As I said, there are two consistent themes in

15

the development of the Social Security survivors*

16

programs, and both of those are raised in this case.

17

One of those themes is Congress’s recognition repeatedly

18

over the years of various classifications whose

19

dependency on a deceased wage earner renders them

20

entitled to benefits under the survivors'

21

.

program.

And

the other theme which runs parallel to that is

22

Congress’s persistent desire to eliminate the remarriage

23

penalty .

24
25

The remarriage penalty, of course, operates so
that if a survivor beneficiary remarries someone else,

2

eliminated the remarriage penalty in various

4

circumstances, and it is indicated that the general

5

remarriage rule, the remarriage penalty, should

6

essentially be eliminated altogether.

But Congress has gradually

So, those two themes, I think are crucial in

7

8

understanding appellees* contention in this case.

By

9

1965 Congress had recognized that divorced surviving

10

spouses' dependency on the deceased wage earner was

11

sufficient that they should be entitled to survivors*

12

benefits.
This rendered them effectively the same in all

13
14

relevant respects as non-divorced surviving spouses.

15

The remarriage penalty, however, was still in effect and

16

Congress recoqnized that it created a serious dilemma

17

for many widows.
In

18

1977, therefore, Congress set out to remove'

19

the remarriage barrier, but as we have noted, removed -t

20

only for one classification of surviving spouses, those

21

who were not divorced, what we normally call widows and

22

think it is very important to understand

24

what happened in 1977.

it selected the divorced because they were a group which

to discourage —

17

HR. DEFORDi

Certainly there's an incentive,

18

but the reason we brought the case and briefed the case

19

as it is, is because of the similarity between the two

20

groups of spouses, and I'm certain many distinctions

21

could be drawn between parents and children as opposed

to spouses, which might make it rational to distinguish

between those classifications.

the children and parents.
NR. DEFDRDs

12

That’s correct, but as I

indicated, I think the distinctions between children and

parents are such that it's not logical to compare these

classifications.

The other issue in the case, of course, is the

The

So, what we are talking here for the most part

11

is not asking the Court to overrule the Secretary but

12

for the Court to analyze as a practical matter what the

process.

successful at whatever level, district, court of appeals

If the Secretary is ultimately

10

or Supreme Court, then all the factual exhaustion which

11

has taken place prior to the filing of the complaint

12

will have been totally wasted because the class members

13

for the most part are not going to be eligible for

14

benefits anyhow, as the Court has held that the statute

15

is constitutional.

16

So, not only is a waste of administrative

17

resources, but it's actually counterproductive to the

18

entire system.

19

in mind the practical reason why the Secretary is

20

pressing exhaustion in this context, and we think he's

21

doing it because it's a shield to protect him from

22

significant relief when plaintiffs are successful in

23

district court.

24
25

We think also that the Court should keep

There is absolutely no practical reason to
require exhaustion for named plaintiffs.

2

for benefits because their facts are such that they are

3

not eligible under tie statute, no purpose is then

4

served by requiring them to go through an administrative

5

p rose ss.

6

Once the Secretary determines that a

7

constitutional claim exists, which the Secretary himself

8

has no competence to resolve, the only logical

9

conslusion to be drawn is that a final decision has been

10

reached, so that no further exhaustion is required.

11

Now, the other component of the class action

issue is what is known as the 60-day rule and that is

13

the guestion of wietaer class members moved untimely

through the administrative process and in the district
