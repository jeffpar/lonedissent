ON BEHALF CF PETITIONEES
MR. TROLLi

The

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court.
The primary question in this case is whether a

15

corporate employer is automatically liable under Title

16

VII for a supervisor's sexual advances toward a

17

subordinate even though the employer did not know about

18

the advances and never had a chance to stop them.

19

The district court, after taking eleven days

20

of evidence,

found that the employee had suffered no

21

Title VII discrimination and it rendered judgment

22

against her.

23

bank had nc notice of the supervisor's alleged

24

discrimination and therefore it could not be liable as a

25

matter of law.

The district court also found that the

proceeding.

Ms. Vinson, plaintiff in this case, went to

and finally tc

It was undisputed at trial

Ms. Vinson’s immediate supervisor throughout

10

this period was Sidney L. Taylor.

11

branch manager and an assistant vice president.

12

trial Ms. Vinson claimed that she and Mr. Taylor began a

13

sexual affair in May 1975, to which she consented out of

14

fear cf losing her jot.

15

She claimed

that for the next two and one-half

16

years Mr. Taylor repeatedly demanded sex from her and

17

otherwise harassed her physically and verbally.

18

19

Taylor, even though she herself was a supervisory

20

employee and had regular contact with higher bank

21

office rs.

22

But she

Mr. Taylor denied having a sexual relationship

23

with her, and he further denied all of her accusations

24

cf harassment.

Vinson left the bank and filed this lawsuit that they

2

cut his instructions tc train a new teller.
The bank showed that it had a written policy

3
4

expressly prohibiting sex discrimination and had

5

appointed one of its senior cfficials as its EEO officer

6

to enforce the non-discrimination policy.

7

written grievance procedure for resolving employee

complaints.

It also had a

He is not before this Court.
Have ycu represented him in the

past?
HR. TROLL;

14

No, we have not.

We have

the district ccurt and the Ccurt of Appeals.

ME. TROLL;

Although I don't think it's part

20

cf the record, it is my understanding that he is still

21

employed with the bank and is still at the branch

22

premises where the alleged incidents occurred.

23

The bank denied that Ms. Vinson or anyone else

24

had ever complained about any harassment or any other

25

discriminatory activity.

The tank also showed that Ms.
5

(202) 628-9300

1

Vinson had ie€n offered routine transfers away from Hr»

2

Taylor to other bank departments, but that she had

3

turned these down.

4

Judge Penn found

that Ms. Vinson's

5

participation in any sexual affair with her supervisor,

6

if indeed there was one, was voluntary and had nothing

7

to do with employment.

8

necessarily disbelieved her testimony about Hr. Taylcr's

9

harassment and coarcion.

10

In so finding. Judge Penn

In fact, the court pointedly referred to

11

testimony from one of Ms. Vinson's own witnesses, a

12

co-worker, who said that Ms. Vinson did not appear to be

13

afraid cf Mr. Taylor.

14

Judge Penn also expressly found that the tank

15

was without notice of any sexual improprieties.

16

court said -- and I'm reading from Judge Penn's

17

findings!

(202) 628-9300

1

support, but indeed coirpel, the conclusions both that

2

Ms. Vinson was not the victim of sexual harassment and

3

that the bank could not be liable for Mr. Taylor's

4

conduct without having been placed on some form of

5

notice.

6

Despite these findings, the Court cf Appeals

7

reversed and remanded the case on three grounds.

8

the Court of Appeals said that the trial court failed to

9

consider whether the employee had a claim based on a

10

sexually offensive work environment, even though she

11

lost no promotions or ether jot benefits.

12

Second, the Court of Appeals said

First,

that

13

evidence of the employee's cwn voluntary sexual behavior

14

at work should not have been admitted at trial.

15

Third and most unsettling, the Court of

16

Appeals stated that an innocent employer is liable

17

automatically for a supervisor's sexual conduct.

18

QUESTION*

Mr. Troll, do you concede that the

19

trial court simply didn't handle the case as one

20

involving a recognition of a sexual harassment or

21

hostile environment type claim?

22

MR. TROLL;

We would concede. Your Honor, that

23

at the time this case was tried before Judge Fenn, cf

24

course, that theory of law had not been applied to

25

sexual harassment cases.

QUESTIGN*

Okay.

So you agree that the

2

district court really didn't try the case with that

3

theory in mind.

MR. TROLL*

He agree

that he did net.

However, I wculd hasten —

6

QUESTION*

Now, do you agree today that that

7

is a valid claim or cculd be a valid claim under Title

8

VII?

MR. TROLLi

As we've mentioned

in our brief,

10

if the employee has

11

detriment we feel indeed it would be cognizable.

12

sustained some form of tangible job

QUESTION*

Well, even without detriment other

13

than the suffering that occurs in the hostile

14

environment itself, do you agree that such a claim might

15

exist?

16

brief suggests that there is such a claim.

17

I notice that the Solicitor General in an amicus

MR. TROLLi

They do in fact suggest that, Your

18

Honor.

19

20

cr emoticnal harm, that yes, there would indeed exist

21

such a claim.

22

It is our position that if there is seme ferm cf

But in analyzing that particular issue in the

23

case, it appears to us, as we’ve argued in cur brief,

24

that Congress was concerned with tangible economic loss,

25

net with psychological cr emcticnal injury.

QUESTIONS

1

Wculd ycu say that if it were a

2

racial harmful environment claim that a tangible effect

3

on employment is a necessary element of s uc h a claiir?

4

HR. TROLL;

We would believe. Your Honor, that

5

a reasoned argument could be made contrary tc cur

position.

7

had never befcre considered the issue, because the

8

legislative history did not address psychological or

9

emotional harm but only tangible economic loss, that

that matter should be raised as it was.
QUESTION;

12

apply similarly in a

13

to a racial?

Do you think the principle should
sexual harassment claim as it would

14

MR. TROLL*

Yes, we dc.

15

The Court of Appeals secondly said that

16

evidence of the employee's own voluntary sexual behavior

17

at work should not have bean admitted.

18

the Court of Appeals was wrong for ordering a remand in

19

this case.

20

We submit that

A remand is pointless and unnecessary.

First,

21

the one tc one sexual relationship and harassment Ms.

22

Vinson alleged in this case, even if true, is not a

23

condition of employment under Title VII.

24

there is no need for the case tc go back to the trial

25

judge for further consideration.

Therefore,

QUESTION;

New, where is the statute or

anyplace else do you get the need to notify the bank?
MR. TROLL;

Well, Your Honor, in reading the

statute, of course, as we’ve indicated in our brief, it

QUESTION;

Well, but if the supervisor

discharged an employee within his apparent authority tc

do so, but his real reason was a racial discriminatory

11

reason, do you think the employer has a defense?

MS. BARRY*

In the rebuttal, but there would

be no purpose because, unless the defendant, either one

14

of the defendants or both of them, was putting on a case

15

of environmental harassment, it would not, even under

16

the rules of evidence, be proper rebuttal.

17

As I understand rebuttal testimony, it has to

be to controvert that which the defendant has said or to

controvert, in a Title VII case under Aukens, to shew

Again, I would like to say we’re not saying

Therefore, how she conducted herself
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

towards the supervisor is the kind of evidence that

2

would be directly relevant and cn point.

3

the trial court said over and ever again that, I want to

4

hear what happened between Ms. Vinson and Mr. Taylor.

5

And only when they brought in this general sexual

6

character evidence did he say that now a very

7

bread-based kind of evidence would be allowed to ccire

8

in.

Ard in fact,

9

But also underlying that assumption, as I

10

understand the arguments of the Petitioner, Justice

11

Rehnguist, is that the evidence is being proffered for

12

two reasons;

13

which is the bank's position and Mr. Taylor’s position,

14

the acts never occurred; or it's evidence that, in case

15

you decide to believe her that something happened, that

16

she volunteered to it.

17

either because she fantasized the charges,

So what we have in this case is just not

18

alternative pleadings, but alternative proof of facts.

19

It either has to go in on one theory or it has to go in

20

on the other, and they have argued in their brief on

21

both theories.

22

How, if they're saying that this was evidence

23

of voluntary work place conduct that proved

that the

24

relationship was a consensual one, then what they're

25

saying, Justice Rehnguist, is that their own supervisor

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

committed perjury in a court of law.

2

reason, we have to lock carefully at this evidence,

3

because maybe the Court of Appeals was right, the trial

4

court used that evidence, as I say, to jump the gun and

5

say, well, whatever happened, it had tc be voluntary and

6

I don't really care what happened.

7

And for that

It’s very important in this case tc determine

8

what happened, and if we're allowed to go back on remand

9

that would be the first responsibility of the tryer of

10

fact, to determine who is credible in this case, whc is

11

telling the truth with respect to the most important

12

issues

13
14
15

Has it Mr. Taylor or was it Ms. Vinson?
QUESTIONS

Counsel, I might have missed it,

but how do you answer the question about notice?
MS. BARRYs

With respect to notice, we rely on

16

the definition of employer set out in Section 701(a),

17

which talks about an employer is a person, which is

18

anyone engaged in commerce and employing sc many

19

employees, and an agent of

20

that employer.

That is to say, for purposes of Title VTI

21

liability there is no imputation of notice.

22

Taylor becomes the bank because he is a supervisor.

23

New, in the definitions there is no direct reference cf

24

supervisor.

It was under the

and it was only

10

because he was the supervisor, it was only because he

11

was the bank at the Northeast branch, that he was able

12

tc accomplish this.
And for that reason, when they say we have tc

14

have notice, notice to Sidney Taylor when she told him

15

tc stop doing these things was sufficient notice tc the

Also -QUESTION;

I agree that the statute defines an

agent of an employer as an employer himself or herself.

Eut that doesn't mean that -- all that means is there

are twc employers in this case; one is Taylor and the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF

F. ROBERT TRCIL, ESQ.

16

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

17

MR. TROLL*

Very briefly, the reason why

18

notice to Mr. Taylor is not notice to the bank is that

19

notice tc the actual perpetrator in and of itself can

20

never constitute notice.

21

tc keep his conduct secret and to keep it concealed from

22

his superiors, who may discipline him for it.

23

The perpetrator is motivated

This rule requiring notice is particularly

24

heightened in this form of sexual harassment case, where

25

one on one conduct occurs.

Simply put, the victim knows
48

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

that notice will more than likely not come from her

2

supervisor.

3

If she wishes relief, she must complain.

In the example given, I think, where a

complaint is made to a vice president, notice can never
