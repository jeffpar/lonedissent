ORAL ARGUMENT OF SCOTT P. COOPER

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

10

MR. COOPER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
Landgraf and its progeny provide the basis for a

11

decision in this case.

12

not direct that it apply retrospectively to events that

13

occurred prior to its enactment.

14

the 1976 expropriation exception to alleged conduct that

15

occurred in and before 1948 would change the legal

16

consequences of that conduct, and therefore be impermissibly

17

retroactive.

18

Moreover, application of

QUESTION: What -- why would it change the legal

19

consequences?

20

where you can sue?

21

In enacting the FSIA, Congress did

It -- wouldn't it just change where you can,

MR. COOPER: No, in fundamental terms it would

22

change the legal consequences.

Prior to 1976, there was

23

complete immunity in this country for claims of

24

expropriation.

25

they would not be hailed into our courts to answer for the

Foreign sovereigns had an expectation that

1

internal exercise of their sovereign activities, and that is

2

the fundamental aspect of -­

3

QUESTION: Did the Tate letter have any coverage

4

prior to '76, the so-called Tate letter from the State

5

Department?

6

MR. COOPER: The so-called Tate letter changed the

7

State Department's position with respect to commercial

8

activities as of 1952.

9

concerned what has always been recognized as essentially

10
11

This conduct all preceded 1952 and

public acts, that is, acts of expropriation.
But to finish the answer to Justice Scalia, the -­

12

the issue that underlies the whole concept of foreign

13

sovereign immunity at its very basis is the question of

14

whether our courts, in the case of United States'

15

jurisdiction, will exercise jurisdiction to question past

16

judgment on the sovereign conduct of foreign states acting

17

in their own -- within their own borders with respect to

18

property within their own country in this case.

19

something that as a matter of comity and as a matter of

20

international concepts of orderly relationships between

21

sovereigns that we don't tolerate.

22

And that's

QUESTION: But I thought that -- well, first, I

23

think you recognize that this suit could be brought inside

24

Austria, and then one of the countries that don't follow the

25

-- the absolute rule.

Then it seems to me that Justice

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Scalia is right, it's a question of where you can sue.

2

-- your argument is the United States has been self-denying,

3

but countries like Austria itself that don't follow that

4

absolute rule could be a proper forum.

5

You

MR. COOPER: With respect, Justice Ginsburg, the -­

6

this issue of the adoption of the restrictive theory by any

7

country is really a red herring here.

8

exception concerns itself with what has always been

9

recognized as a public act, and that is that the act of

The expropriation

10

expropriation, something that can only be done by a

11

governmental entity through the exercise of its governmental

12

authority.

13

QUESTION: But I -- as I understand this claim,

14

it's not the original ex parte -- expropriation is when

15

Austria isn't even a country, because this happened in the

16

Nazi period, right?

17

MR. COOPER: No, Your Honor.

The United States'

18

position throughout World War II and thereafter has been

19

that Austria retained its sovereignty, that it was an

20

occupied state by the Nazi regime.

21

immediately recognized -­

The United States

22

QUESTION: Then why was there a second republic?

23

MR. COOPER: The second republic was the

24

reconstituted government of the state of Austria, but the

25

United States' position, and it is the executive's position
5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that has binding authority with respect to the sovereign

2

status, the executive's position was that Austria was always

3

a state.

4

More importantly, Your Honor -­

5

QUESTION: But may I continue, because I thought

6

that this claim, whatever you say about Austria's status in

7

the, at the time of the Anschluss, that it's not necessarily

8

about the stealing of the goods, it's about the retention of

9

the goods.

10

MR. COOPER: We don't believe that that's a correct

11

reading of section 1603 -- 1605(a)(3).

12

itself with the expropriation of property.

13

I articulated the power for the enactment of the

14

expropriation exception as the power to define and punish

15

violations of the laws of nations, and it is not even

16

arguably the case that a possession of expropriated

17

property, especially as it's been argued by the respondent,

18

not necessarily even having been expropriated by the

19

defendant country, is a violation of international law.

20
21

1605(a)(3) concerns
The Congress -­

QUESTION: So if you know that you've taken from an
expropriator, that's all right under international law?

22

MR. COOPER: It's not a question of whether it's

23

all right.

It's a question of whether Congress decided that

24

it was a basis for an exception to the long-standing and

25

general rule of law in this country, that is, sovereign
6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

immunity.

2

that one of the narrow and specified exceptions to foreign

3

sovereign immunity is the mere possession of property?

4
5

So in other words, has -- has Congress determined

QUESTION: Is it sovereign immunity or is it the
act of state doctrine?

6

MR. COOPER: It's sovereign immunity, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION: Well, but, I mean, even -- there -­

8

there are two things that happen here.

The sovereign can be

9

brought into court, but more than that, the sovereign can be

10

held to account for the act of the sovereign on its own

11

territory.

12

substantive law, the former, just allowing the sovereign to

13

come into your -- or allowing your court to entertain a suit

14

against the sovereign is -- is just -- just where suit goes.

15

It has nothing to do with the outcome of the suit.

The latter, it seems to me, can be described as

16

MR. COOPER: This Court determined -­

17

QUESTION: So I -- I wish you could tell me that it

18

did have to do with the act of state doctrine, because that

19

would be -- that would be a substantive change and that

20

should not be retroactive.

21

MR. COOPER: The -- the active state doctrine is an

22

independent doctrine that is not before the Court today.

23

The sovereign immunity doctrine is before the Court today.

24

Sovereign immunity, this Court decided in Verlinden, is a

25

matter of substantive Federal law.

This Court made that

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

decision after careful consideration and with specific

2

reference to the FSIA and Congress' power to enact it, and

3

concluded that it was more than a jurisdictional statute.

4

Moreover, in the Hughes case, this Court

5

determined that merely articulating a statute's terms in

6

terms of jurisdiction does not remove it from the

7

retroactivity analysis we urge is the rule of law that -­

8

that determines the outcome of this case.

9

contrary.

Quite the

Hughes made it clear that in circumstances very

10

much like these, where a cause of action was not previously

11

allowed, and here the immunity kept a -- an action for

12

expropriation from being adjudicated in American courts

13

under those circumstances.

14

fundamental change in the law with respect to foreign

15

sovereigns.

16

As of 1976, there was a

QUESTION: Well, in Hughes -- in Hughes there were

17

-- there were other changes besides the -- besides the

18

jurisdictional one.

19

eliminated.

20

case for you, but Verlinden, it seems to me, is -- is -- is

21

closer, but we were determining there whether it was a

22

substantive law or not for a very different purpose, for the

23

existence of -- of power on the part of the Federal

24

Government to -- to enact the statute.

25

bit different from the purpose for which we're determining

There -- there were defenses that were

I don't think Hughes is a very good -- good

That's a -- that's a

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whether it's a substantive law here.

2

MR. COOPER: The interest of the United States,

3

Your Honor, in the -- the administration of cases against

4

foreign sovereigns has long been recognized by this Court as

5

being a -- a matter of great national interest.

6

question of when we decide to exercise jurisdiction over

7

foreign sovereigns is an essential component of the way this

8

country interacts with other countries.

9

which the Constitution conferred responsibility on the

The

It's an area in

10

political branches.

The executive exercised that

11

responsibility for the vast portion of this country's

12

history and then submitted to Congress an act, the Foreign

13

Sovereign Immunity Act, which Congress then enacted, and

14

created -­

15

QUESTION: But none of that's in question.

16

MR. COOPER:

17
18

-- very narrow exceptions to the

doctrine.
QUESTION: None of that's in question.

The only

19

thing that's in question is when Congress enacted this, did

20

they intend it to have the effect of -- of -- what should I

21

say -- de-immunizing, if you want to put it that way, prior

22

acts or not.

23

MR. COOPER: And it -­

24

QUESTION: We're -- we're not questioning the

25

authority of the executive or the authority of the
9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

legislature or the importance of this matter.

2

the issue is, what did Congress mean by this statute?

3

Essentially,

MR. COOPER: And Congress in this Court has clearly

4

articulated in -- in Landgraf and in the -- the several

5

cases that followed it, exactly how we determined what it

6

was that Congress did as it relates to the retroactive

7

aspects of those changes in law.

8
9

QUESTION: And in -- in our domestic jurisprudence,
we are cautious about retroactivity because it destroys

10

subtle expectations.

11

we're talking about foreign sovereign immunity, or are there

12

other considerations such as the dignity or -- of the

13

foreign state?

14

Is that same rationale applicable when

MR. COOPER: We think when the issue of a concept

15

of basic fairness so close to the root of our understanding

16

of what constitutes fair treatment of any individual, that

17

no less standard -­

18

QUESTION: Well, that's why -­

19

MR. COOPER:

20
21

-- no less rigorous standard than

Landgraf should apply.
QUESTION: That leads to my -- my next question.

22

If we're talking about expectations, my understanding -­

23

correct me if I'm wrong -- is that in 1948 Austria was -­

24

and all countries -- were on notice that immunity would be

25

judged later on by acts of the executive, or in this case,
10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

by an act of Congress.

2

there would be a later determination of whether there was

3

immunity?

4

Wasn't the expectation here that

MR. COOPER: The expectation was that, based on the

5

general concepts of international law and general concepts

6

of comity, which are not just a question of whim or

7

courtesy, but rather a question of fair treatment of one

8

sovereign by another with the expectation that the sovereign

9

who is declining jurisdiction would be fairly treated in the

10
11

courts of other countries.
QUESTION: But still whether or not there would be

12

immunity, Austria and all other countries knew, would be a

13

later determination, so that the expectation they had was to

14

that extent necessarily, it seems to me, diminished -­

15

MR. COOPER: The expect -­

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. COOPER: Expectations are only one of a number

-- or qualified.

18

of factors that the Court has referred to in Landgraf.

19

QUESTION: So it's -- so there are additional

20
21

factors other than expect.

What are the additional factors?

MR. COOPER: Well, certainly.

Landgraf quoted

22

Justice Story in his 1814 articulation of what was relevant,

23

but the factors are expectations, changed circumstances, and

24

changed considerations for the parties.

MR. COOPER: -- part of common sense -­

QUESTION:

-- for the moment.

Let's -- before you

6

get off of expectations, I don't know that we protect

7

expectations of the sort that -- that you're talking about.

8

Let's assume that a state which has not -- not previously

allowed a tort action by -- by two out-of-state people,

between two out-of-state people, to be brought within that

you're disrupting people's expectations if you allow those

QUESTION: I'm sueable here, but I'm not sueable in

MR. COOPER: That kind of particularized reliance

individual, when that individual acted, or the party, when

9

that party acted, had in mind the current state of law.

The

question has been as a matter of common sense understanding,

is the new law a change in the consequences for past

conduct?

reliance and expectation?

15

though there may be no reliance.

correctly?

MR. COOPER: We are focused on the changed legal

18

consequences, not the subjective intention of the party in

19

any respect.

20

QUESTION: But is -- do -- do you articulate that

21

in terms of the country's expectation, even though the

22

country may not have relied upon that expectation when it

acted?

1

MR. COOPER: Not solely.

We are not focused on the

2

expectation component of the test.

3

primarily, although I think expectations could be a factor,

4

we think that the more important aspect of the analysis is

5

the changed legal circumstances.

6

of what the -­

7

We are focused

That's -- that's the core

QUESTION: And the changed legal circumstance that

8

I understand you're emphasizing here is that, at least prior

9

to 1976, this particular possession of expropriated

10

property, as well as the expropriation itself, would not

11

have been cognizable in the court of any country unless

12

possibly the country itself, which as an act of grace later,

13

decided to -- to make its own reparations.

14

that section -- that exception -- it would not be -- would

15

not have been cognizable anywhere?

But subject to

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS G. HUNGAR

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE
SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS
MR. HUNGAR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
The position of the United States has always been

3

that sovereign immunity bars U.S. courts from adjudicating

4

pre-1976 expropriation claims against foreign sovereigns.

5

As this Court recognized in Dames and Moore, claims by

6

nationals of one country against the government of another

7

are frequently sources of friction between the two

8

sovereigns.

9

Since 19 -- prior to 1976, therefore, and absent a

10

waiver of sovereign immunity, expropriation claims against

11

foreign sovereigns have always been addressed through

12

diplomatic negotiations and foreign claims processes, and

13

not in U.S. courts.

14

numerous agreements with foreign countries regarding such

15

claims, always against and with a background understanding

16

prior to 1976 that such claims could not be adjudicated in

17

U.S. courts.

18

And the United States has entered into

QUESTION: Is -- is the friction that's feared in

19

part based on changed expectations, or is that just

20

irrelevant to the analysis?

21

MR. HUNGAR: Changed expectations are relevant in,

22

in the general sense, not the particular -- particularized

23

expectations of a particular state, but that it is a general

24

rule and understanding of international laws set forth in

25

the Vienna Convention on Treaties and elsewhere that changes
15

in international law, including changes in sovereign

2

immunity law, are not retroactively applied.

numerous examples of the latter point cited in our brief at

QUESTION: But I thought part of the baseline of

executive.

So I don't see how wealth -- how settled this

MR. HUNGAR: The -- the case that -- the doctrine

of absolute sovereign immunity, there were no -- there are

18

no exceptions.

19

expectation or reason to believe that the executive of this

country would deny immunity in an expropriation case because

21

that had never happened in the history of the absolute

22

doctrine, immunity doctrine, for 150 years.

23

no suit in the United States has been permitted, was

QUESTION: Would that be true of -- would that be
true of Austria itself if the tables were turned?
MR. HUNGAR: It's unclear whether a -- a court

6

action could have been brought, at least we're not familiar

7

with anything in the record that indicates whether a court

8

action could have been brought in 1948, under, for example,

9

the restitution law that Austria passed in 1947.

QUESTION: I think there was -­

11

MR. HUNGAR: But that's irrelevant because it can't

17

Mr. Cooper said.

18

we want others to be treated -- treat others -- treat others

19

well so that they will treat us well.

20

like he was speaking in reciprocity terms.

21

He said this was a matter of fairness and

That sounded to me

MR. HUNGAR: Reciprocity is also an important

22

consideration, Your Honor.

If this law were to be applied

23

retroactively, it could open the United States to reciprocal

24

claims brought in foreign courts, which would further

25

complicate our foreign relations.

QUESTION: Well, how -- how does it work if in fact

2

you treat the statute as purely jurisdictional?

3

to, one, establish jurisdiction, they have it under 1330.

4

You have to have venue, they established that.

5

look to see if it's wiped out by sovereign immunity, and

6

(a)(3) says this is a case in which rights and property

7

taken in violation of international law are an issue.

8

Right.

9

You have

And then you

So suppose you said, yes, that is such a case,

10

even though the expropriation took place in '48 or earlier

11

perhaps.

12

well, you don't win if you wanted to.

13

there first is the act of state doctrine, and this was not

14

clearly in violation of international law in 1948, or you

15

could file, what is it called, it's a -- an information, or

16

what is it, it's a suggestion of something or other -- it's

17

a -­

Then the State Department could come in and say,

And you say

20

it's the -- there's a -- there's a foreign policy interest

21

here, and so that way the State Department's in control, and

22

if it feels that it would hurt foreign affairs to have the

23

suit go ahead, it says either act of state if it's not clear

24

or a statement of interest, and a -- which is a kind of

25

political question, I guess.

And so, what -- how does that, in other words,

2

where am I wrong in thinking there's no real foreign policy

3

concern here in respect to the application of this statute

4

as a purely jurisdictional matter?

MR. HUNGAR: We believe that the -- as we said in

our briefs, and part of the reason we're here today is that

there are foreign policy concerns implicated -­

was wrong with what I just said?

We are

12

here today saying the United States has an interest in not

13

having this expropriation exception applied retroactively

14

because it would undermine the background assumption -­

15

QUESTION: I understand that and I'm trying to get

16

to the reasoning.

And my thought was, I don't see why it

17

affects foreign affairs.

18

you believe it does and I'm sure you're right, but I just

19

want to know why, and the reason I find it difficult to see

20

why is because it seems to me you still, even assuming

21

jurisdiction, can come in and say this was an act of state,

22

this seizure in 1948, or you can file a statement of

23

interest, which I take it is saying there's a big foreign

24

policy matter here and we're working it out in other forums

25

and you courts stay out of it.

You can explain why.

I understand

Now -- now am I wrong about

I'm sure you're going to say I am wrong and I want to

MR. HUNGAR: Well, we don't perceive a meaningful

4

difference between an amicus brief expressing foreign policy

5

concerns, which is what we have filed, and a statement of

6

interest expressing foreign policy concerns.

7

QUESTION: Ah.

Well, then the correct result in

8

this case is to say yes, this statute applies, it applies to

9

1948 seizures, because they were in violation of

10

international law.

Now, the State Department files a

11

statement of interest saying to the court, there is a valid

foreign policy reason for not going ahead in this case.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. RANDOL SCHOENBERG

12

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

13

15

MR. SCHOENBERG: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
We believe there are four independent grounds for

16

affirming the lower court in this case.

17

has just discussed, the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act

18

regulates the exercise of jurisdiction, not the underlying

19

primary conduct of the parties.

21

First, as the Court

Therefore, the Act does not

QUESTION: Well, why doesn't it retro -- why -- why

22

isn't it just as easy to say that it does operate

23

retrospectively, because the question is, when should it

24

exercise jurisdiction for a particular purpose?

25

one hand there's no point in exercising jurisdiction now if

And on the

it's not going to adjudicate later, so so far as the court

2

is concerned, presumably it's going to adjudicate on a

3

substantive issue.

4
5
6
7
8
9

That being the purpose, why can you -- why really
does it make sense to draw that neat line?
MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I'm -- I'm not sure that I
understand the question.
QUESTION: Why -- why -- why isolate jurisdiction
when we all know that the purpose of exercising the

10

jurisdiction is to exercise it for the purpose of

11

adjudicating a particular kind of case and to apply a

12

particular substantive law to it?

13

MR. SCHOENBERG: Because the -- the operative

14

event, the event that's being regulated by a jurisdictional

15

statute, as the Court has said, is that exercise of the

16

Court's power, regardless of when the underlying acts took

17

place, the Court has differentiated between the primary

18

conduct of the parties and the secondary conduct, which is

19

the exercise of the Court's power.

20

For example, just last term in the Dole Food case,

21

the Court found that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is

22

not intended to chill the conduct of the foreign state.

23

Rather, it's there to decide whether now presently it would

24

embarrass the conduct of foreign relations, and the -- 25

25

years ago, over 25 years ago, Congress decided that cases
25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

such as these should be allowed to go forward.

2

QUESTION: Well, the Government of the United

3

States has just said you're going to embarrass foreign

4

relations whether the United States' position with respect

5

to a consideration in interpreting this act is raised now or

6

whether it's raised after jurisdiction is assumed and you

7

get to the next stage.

8

and consider it in interpreting the -- the scope of the act,

9

in particular its retroactivity.

10

Why not -- why not get into it now

MR. SCHOENBERG: This would be a much different

11

case if the foreign government had ever said that the

12

prosecution of this case would interfere with foreign

13

relations, as it has in all of these other cases.

14

hasn't in this case, it hasn't filed a suggestion of

15

immunity, it hasn't filed a statement of interest.

16

of fact, it required Austria to withdraw the act of state

17

doctrine defense when it was asserted below.

But it

This case

QUESTION: But I thought it just told us that it
would be an interference three minutes ago.
MR. SCHOENBERG: The concern, as I understand the

22

Government's concern, is that in other cases that are

23

pending against Japan and Mexico, et cetera, there might be

24

foreign relation issues.

25

QUESTION: Well, why -- why should we look further?
26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

If the Government says that, I mean, isn't that conclusive

in a case like this?

MR. SCHOENBERG: I don't -- I don't think so.

10

why the second issue is very important.

12

that -- that jurisdiction is not the same as justiciability.

21

April, she threw out that entire class action, because the

22

Government had come in and filed a statement of interest and

23

asserted its interest in the -- in the case, and she found

24

very similar to the Court's holding in Garamendi last term

25

that the political question doctrine was implicated when the

Government comes in and says that the prosecution of this

2

particular case will interfere with foreign relations.

3

But I've never heard any -- in any other case the

4

Government say that a case that does not implicate foreign

5

relations, as this one does, should be dismissed on

jurisdiction grounds merely because we have justiciability

7

concerns with other cases.

QUESTION: What -- what is it if -- what do you
reply to their, what I take is their argument, that if we

10

say there is jurisdiction here, so that this covers pre-1952

11

expropriations, think of all the eastern European bloc, what

12

used to be, millions of pieces of real estate, et cetera,

13

and Japan, Peru, all over the world, South America, there

14

have been expropriations, and suddenly our Court becomes -­

citizen, for expropriations that may have taken under

10

would be unwise for the courts to venture into this

the appropriate way to adjudicate these cases.

13

In our case, we have a treaty, article 26 of the

taken from Jewish families during the Nazi era.

16

no dispute between the two countries as to whether or what

private act to collect paintings, I'm not sure is so clear.

3

QUESTION: Let's assume it's a public act.

Does it

4

have an expectation that -- that that will be adjudicated

5

under the then-prevailing norms?

6

MR. SCHOENBERG: I -- well, yes and no.

Yes in the

7

sense that we do have to establish that -- that this

8

property was taken in violation of international law, and I

9

think that part of the statute clearly expects that the

10

taking be adjudicated according to the state of

11

international law at the time.

12

yes.

13

think doesn't determine the -- the retroactivity question.

14
15
16

So to that degree I think

But whether -- whether it's a public or private act I

QUESTION: But we're told that at least in this
country such acts were never adjudicated in foreign courts.
MR. SCHOENBERG: I -- I understood that to be the

17

Government's position.

18

explains The Santissima Trinidad case, which is a case

19

concerning private property on a ship where not one, but

20

several, sovereigns claimed an ownership interest, and

21

Justice Story said that our courts, of course, have to

22

adjudicate the ownership of that private property,

23

regardless of whether it was taken as part of a public act.

24
25

I don't know how the Government

In the Santissima Trinidad, it's a confusing case,
and I'm not sure, even having read it many times, how the
34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

ship came to be in its final location, but as I understand

2

it, it went through many different, many different hands.

3

And the question at the end was, because the sovereigns were

4

claiming the ship, which was potentially a ship of war, does

5

that mean that the Court could not adjudicate the ownership

6

of cargo on the ship?

7

And Justice Story said no.

QUESTION: No, but he -- isn't the -- the concern

8

about the applicability of that case to this one is

9

precisely the reason you said.

It was -- it was a suit

10

between sovereigns and we're talking here about the

11

sovereign immunity defense in a suit by an individual, and

12

it's rather a stretch to take that as -- as the basis for

13

your law in this case.

14

MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I would -- I would think

15

that the act of state doctrine, which is what we were

16

talking about, would -- would be implicated even more

17

strongly in a -- in a suit involving multiple sovereigns

18

than it would with regard to just an individual against a

19

sovereign.

20

I think for the first time today that the expropriation

21

clause sort of appeared from nowhere, but I don't think

22

that's the case.

23

clearly is the Santissima Trinidad case.

24

property is inside the United States in connection with the

25

commercial activity.

And I -- I -- the Government makes the position

The first section of 1605(a)(3) very
That's the

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The second clause I believe arises out of the

2

Cuban expropriation cases and the Government's experience in

3

those cases, and it was the intention of the Government in

4

1976 when the executive branch proposed this law and when

5

the Congress enacted it to allow our courts to adjudicate

6

these types of claims.

7

QUESTION: Well, what -- what I'm looking for, I'm

8

beginning to understand his answer better -- I think there

9

should be a way, not in your case necessarily, but in

10

general, for the Government to say, court, stay out of this

11

case, because of the international implications.

12

was thinking is if we -- if this is jurisdictional, follow

13

Justice Powell's distinction, that won't be a problem

14

because there'll be other ways for them to do it.

15

gradually closing those doors.

16

And what I

You're

One way I had thought of was act of state, but you

17

correctly point out that the act of state doctrine does not

18

bar anything when the claim rests upon a treaty or other

19

unambiguous agreement, and your quoting the '55 treaty might

20

not help you because it's post-'48, but a -- but 1907 might

21

help you, so you're there with a treaty.

22

And so they say, well, we can't use that one, and

23

there'll be a lot of cases when we can't.

So then I had

24

mentioned this thing called a statement of interest, which I

25

was looking for an explanation because I don't know what it
36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is.

And there's a third thing that you mentioned, which is

2

called a letter about immunity.

3

because that's what this statute is.

4

Well, that won't help them

See, so that now we're back to the statement of

5

interest.

Now, can -- what is this thing, a statement of

6

interest?

Can -- in other words, is the statement of

7

interest sufficient to achieve the objective that I was

8

thinking was important, that not necessarily your case, but

9

in many other cases there has to be a way for the executive

10

to stop the judge from deciding the matter where it really

11

does interfere with foreign relations.

12

Now, what's -- do you see where I'm --

13

MR. SCHOENBERG: I -­

14

QUESTION: Do you see that that is the thing that

15

has been floating in my mind -­

16

MR. SCHOENBERG: I understand -­

17

QUESTION: -- and I'm trying to settle on.

18

MR. SCHOENBERG: I understand.

It's, of course,

19

difficult for us to talk about it because there is no

20

statement of interest in this case, but -­

21
22

QUESTION: But you can explain to me what a
statement of interest is.

23

MR. SCHOENBERG: Right.

24

QUESTION: And whether a statement of interest is a

25

sufficient legal route to achieve the end that I think is
37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

necessary and that they're arguing for.

2

MR. SCHOENBERG: I believe if -- if the Government

3

were to file a statement of interest saying that the

4

prosecution of this particular lawsuit would interfere with

5

the foreign relations of the Government, I think a court

6

would be proper in abstaining from adjudicating the case

7

under the political question doctrine, very similar to this

8

Court's holding last term in Garamendi, I think.

9

QUESTION: But it wouldn't have to, in your view?

10

MR. SCHOENBERG: I would say it would -- it would

11

be very -- it would almost always have to.

I think -- I

12

think the Court should still be allowed to determine whether

position.

to a statement of interest.

I -- I wouldn't say that our courts necessarily

I think that's the -- the

20

no instance would you concede the appropriateness of -- of

21

the statement of interest being considered at the

MR. SCHOENBERG: That's -- that's absolutely

question.

We're talking today only about the jurisdiction
There hasn't been a statement of interest filed
38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

and there couldn't be a suggestion of immunity.

2

Your Honor.

3
4

QUESTION: No, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry,

What do you do about

Verlinden?

5

MR. SCHOENBERG: Verlinden actually is a great case

6

for us as I realized in reviewing it.

Verlinden is -- is a

7

retroactive application of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities

8

Act.

9

foreign state, something for which there was no jurisdiction

In that case it was a foreign company against a

10

in the United States prior to the enactment of the Foreign

11

Sovereign Immunities Act.

12

when it was brought under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities

13

Act several years later, this Court directed the lower court

14

to adjudicate jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign

15

Immunities Act.

16

That action arose in 1975 and yet

So that case is exactly a -- if -- if anything is

17

retroactive, that's a retroactive application of the Foreign

18

Sovereign Immunities Act.

19

Court's statements in Landgraf that jurisdictional statute

20

which confers or ousts jurisdiction is not impermissibly

21

retroactive and that -­

22
23
24
25

But again, it goes back to this

QUESTION: Did -- Verlinden didn't expressly
discuss the right to retroactivity?
MR. SCHOENBERG: It absolutely did not discuss
retroactivity.

It maybe never occurred to any of the
39

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Justices or the parties at that time that a jurisdictional

2

statute like the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act could be

3

in any way -­

4
5

QUESTION: No, but they -- but we did say that it
wasn't just a jurisdictional statute.

6

That's what we said.

MR. SCHOENBERG: The -- the Court said that it was

7

substantive in Republic of Mexico v. Hoffman in 1945.

The

8

Court refers to sovereign immunity as substantive law.

9

I think as this Court has said, whether you label the -- the

10

law substantive or procedural really isn't the question.

11

The question is, on what activity is -- is the statute

12

operating?

13

and how that is adjudicated by our courts in deciding

14

whether the court has the jurisdiction -­

15

And here it's operating on the claim to immunity

QUESTION: But that -- that has a bearing on the

16

Landgraf exception too.

17

jurisdictional, you know, it isn't so easily disposed of

18

under Landgraf.

19

But

If a statute is more than

MR. SCHOENBERG: It's correct, but I think this

20

case presents a much better case than the two cases cited in

21

Landgraf, the Andrus case and U.S. v. Alabama, although U.S.

22

v. Alabama you could distinguish as something seeking only

23

injunctive relief and therefore prospective.

24

this is a case brought against the U.S. Government after the

25

U.S. Government -- or while the case was pending, I think,

In Andrus,

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the statute is changed to take away the amount in

2

controversy requirement.

3

before the suit could not proceed, now the statute's been

4

changed without any suggestion of retroactivity in the

5

enactment.

6

it's of no moment that this jurisdictional statute has been

7

changed now to allow a suit against in -- in a sovereign

8

entity, the United States.

So, in other words, very clearly

And the Court says -- this is 1978, I think -­

9

So I think this case presents actually a much

10

better -- much better case, because here, and these are

11

other points that I wanted to raise, I believe the text of

12

the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act demonstrates that it

13

was intended to apply to all claims to immunity, regardless

14

of when the acts took place, the underlying acts took place.

15

Our -- our third point -­

16

QUESTION: May I just ask you on that, I mean,

17

isn't the objection to that that the -- that the subject

18

matter we're concerned with here is a subject matter which

19

is defined in terms of property and the history of that

20

property, and the history of that property as expropriated

21

necessarily raises the time question?

22

prior to the -- the enactment of the statute, we

23

necessarily, by the definition of present subject matter,

24

get into an issue of retroactivity.

25

answer to that?

And if the time is

What -- what's the

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, the answer is, again, in

2

Landgraf that not every statute which affects prior events

3

is impermissibly retroactive, and my point was -­

4

QUESTION: But it's not impermissibly retroactive,

5

but it raises the question about the permissibility of a

6

retroactive application.

7

MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, I -- my view is that the

8

Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act is -- is a statute that is

9

designed to take away the immunity decision from the State

10

Department and place it in the hands of judges, and the

11

purpose of the statute was that henceforth all claims to

12

immunity should be adjudicated under this procedure, not the

13

old procedure.

14

position should -­

15

In other words, the U.S. Government's

QUESTION: Yeah, but even -- even that, with

16

respect, it seems to me that that begs the question.

17

court is going to adjudicate.

18

adjudicating them it is going to draw a line based on -- on

19

-- on this temporal consideration.

20

the hands of the court.

21

hands of the court retroactivity ought to be a basis for

22

making the jurisdictional decision.

23

The

The question is whether in

That still leaves it in

But the question is whether in the

MR. SCHOENBERG: I -- I don't -- I don't see -- I

24

don't think that it is with regard to the text of this

25

statute.

I -- even though the statute does refer to events
42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that could take place prior to the enactment, the purpose of

2

the statute, which is what I think the analysis requires

3

that we consider, is to change the forum of the adjudication

4

from the old State Department procedure to the -- to the

5

court procedure under these specific rules.

6

QUESTION: How does your -- the discussion about

7

the statement of interest then fit in?

8

you just said is, they meant to take it away from the State

9

Department and put it in the hands of the court.

10

It seems to me what

MR. SCHOENBERG: The -- the immunity consideration,

11

yes, but I think the statute, the Foreign Sovereign

12

Immunities Act, was not intended to change the rules, for

13

example, with the act of state doctrine or with the statute

14

of the limitations or with any of the other doctrines that

15

might bar an older claim from -- from entering court.

16

Our third point, this I don't want to spend too

17

much time on, but it's our view that the Foreign Sovereign

18

Immunities Act merely codified the common law of sovereign

19

immunity, and therefore, it did not substantially change the

20

law.

21

State Department circular that was sent out in 1976 to

22

foreign states, it says, this enactment will not

23

substantially alter the rules for deciding sovereign

24

immunity questions in U.S. courts.

25

of the State Department at the time that they proposed this

And this is not only my opinion.

If one looks at the

So it was the position

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

legislation that it merely codified what the State

2

Department then considered to be the rules of sovereign

3

immunity.

4

And we have an interesting situation, I think an

5

unprecedented situation, because the common law itself

6

depended on the views of the State Department, so we have a

7

little bit of a reflexive situation.

8

let us suppose, for example, that the -- that instead of

9

enacting the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act they issued

The way I look at it,

10

another Tate letter, another letter that merely said,

11

henceforth we want the courts to adjudicate things under

12

this -- under this regime.

13

just a suggestion to the courts on how to decide cases.

14

So it's not a new statute, it's

Under this Court's ruling with regard to common

15

law, non-statutory law, of course that -- that approach

16

would have to be applied retroactively, and I don't think

17

it's any less retroactive just because the executive branch

18

sent it over to Congress and said, we want you to pass the

19

statute also.

Our last -­

20

QUESTION: Any -- any more retroactive?

21

MR. SCHOENBERG: Any more retroactive.

Our last -­

22

our last point is really the basis for the Ninth Circuit's

23

decision, and that is, as to these parties in this case,

24

there is no impermissibly retroactive effect, because

25

Austria could never have had any expectation of immunity
44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

with regard to Mrs. Altmann's claims.

2

QUESTION: That would be a pretty good nightmare,

3

wouldn't it, if we had to have judges trying to work out on

4

a case-by-case basis, country by country, whether Turkey in

5

1921 when it was an enemy, had a -- didn't have an

6

expectation of being treated as a sovereign, but Hungary in

7

1962 had a different expectation, et cetera.

8

- that -- I think their point on that's a pretty good one,

9

isn't it?

10
11

I mean, that ­

MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, it -- it's -- but it's not a
point about retroactivity, Your Honor.

12

The -­

QUESTION: Well, it is because they're saying that

13

unless you treat these things as a whole, you won't

14

understand the problem.

15

country had no expectation, there are so many countries that

16

did that -- and going into it case by case is so difficult

17

that it would better to have an absolute rule.

18

arguments.

19

And even if in your case the

That's their

MR. SCHOENBERG: It would be better, but that's not

20

really how the Court's retroactivity analysis has gone over

21

the last 10 years, and that's -- that's why I certainly

22

favor some of the earlier arguments.

23

decide the case on those, rather than the way the Ninth

24

Circuit did in evaluating the expectations, but if one

25

doesn't decide in our favor on all of those other arguments,

I think it's easier to

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the statute itself is jurisdictional, that Congress

2

intended it to apply, that there's really no change in the

3

law because it's the same as the common law of sovereign

4

immunity, then really under Hughes one has to look at

5

whether, as to the parties of this case, there is any

6

retroactive effect, and that -- that's -- that's what the

7

Hughes holding is.

8

but let's look at what happened here.

9

plaintiff with new incentives and a defense, substantive

10
11

defense taken away.

It's a statute phrased jurisdictionally,
You have a new

That's the Hughes case.

And so it requires you to look outside the four

12

corners of the statute to look at what was -- what are you

13

comparing the statute to, when -- when in Hughes the Court

14

said if it determines whether a cause of action can proceed

15

and not where, the where question, of course, implies that

16

you have to look and see if there are other jurisdictions

17

where the case could be brought.

18

And in this case, as we've made very clear,

19

Austria could always have been sued, at least since it was

20

re-established after World War II for these acts, and as a

21

matter of fact, Austria was required by the United States to

22

enact restitution laws that were designed to afford people

23

like Mrs. Altmann relief.

24

sovereign immunity in these claims in their own courts and

25

they would not have been allowed to by the U.S. Government,

They have never asserted

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and that sentiment, of course, is echoed in the subsequent

2

treaty in 1955 and it's echoed in the Bernstein letter in

3

1948 that as to expropriations, as to property taken from

4

Jewish families in violation of international law, this

5

country does not recognize sovereign immunity anywhere, not

6

in the states where -- where -- that were involved, and not

7

in the United States, and that -- that's -- that's our last

8

point and that's the Ninth Circuit's position.

9
10

If the Court has no further questions -­
QUESTION: Is it -- is it correct that -- that we

11

would be out of step with all other countries if we -- if we

12

allowed this suit to proceed?

13
14
15

MR. SCHOENBERG: Well, certainly not as a matter of
-- of the statute.

Our -- our -- in terms of --

QUESTION: No, no.

I mean -- I mean, have -- have

16

all other countries, when they've changed to the new modern

17

notion of limited sovereign immunity, have they all declined

18

to -- to apply it in a manner that the Government here would

19

call retroactive?

20

MR. SCHOENBERG: Right.

I -- I don't know how all

21

states have done it.

I know that, for example, in Austria

22

we cited the Dralle case, which concerned a post-war

23

communist expropriation of a -- of a subsidiary company in

24

Czechoslovakia, and a German company was allowed to sue

25

Czechoslovakia in Austria concerning the trademarks and -­
47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and the expropriation, and have an Austrian court rule

2

whether that expropriation violated international law.

3

So I would say as to Austria, the argument is, and

4

I think we cited also in our brief a statement by an

5

Austrian professor, Seidl-Hohenveldern, who said that the

6

courts -- there's nothing in international law that prevents

7

courts from adjudicating the rights and property taken in

8

violation of international law.

that last point, the Dralle case, which is one that we

address in our reply brief, does not stand for the

proposition that Czechoslovakia's expropriation could be

in their own -- in its own country were not subject to

with whether, given its own neutrality as between

located in Austria.

2

what's before the Court today.

3

That issue has nothing to do with

Sovereign immunity isn't merely a form selection

4

rule.

It confers on the foreign state the right to choose

5

whether and where to be sued.

6

It's a right this country has always understood as a right

7

in a sovereign.

8

circumstances under which it would provide remedies in its

9

own country, either by statute or in its own courts, doesn't

That's a substantive right.

Austria's choice, if it did so choose, the

10

constitute a waiver of the sovereignty to which it had been

11

accorded in this country throughout the current period up to

12

1976.

13

So this country has always recognized the

14

difference between a sovereign's right to create a remedy,

15

and this country has done so in its own instances with

16

respect to events that were claimed to be the subject of

17

reparations, and by doing so it has never suggested that it

18

thought it was subjecting itself to the jurisdiction of a

19

foreign court for individual claims to be able to look for

more than the statute of the United States provided for.

21

In addition, with respect to the law immediately

22

prior to the enactment of the FSIA, I think the suggestion

23

was that somehow the United States had -- had eroded the

24

expropriation rule or that Congress thought that it was

25

adopting the -- codifying the law of the land with respect

2

The legislative history, and more importantly the statements

of the State Department, in particular the -- the digest by

4

John Boyd with respect to State Department decisions from

5

1952 to 1976 cited in our brief make it clear that the State

6

Department considered this to be a fundamental change in the

7

law.

The conduct being regulated here is expropriation

or at the very least possession that goes back to events in

1948 alleged in the complaint.

11

12

mere substitution of another tribunal.

that Congress focused on in each of the expropriation

16

narrow exceptions to the general concept of foreign

17

sovereign immunity.

This is something

It identified the conduct that it thought the

Whether that was an express waiver under (a)(1),

19

whether that was the exercise of commercial conduct that any

20

private party could engage in under (a)(2) or the -- or the

21

expropriation of property in violation of international law

22

in (a)(3), Congress identified the conduct that it thought

23

justified the lifting of the generally applicable foreign

24

sovereign immunity and decided that's the conduct we want to

25

regulate.

And that's what we think justifies the variance

is a change in the law that requires application of the

retroactivity analysis to treat those sovereigns fairly.

If there are no further questions, I have nothing.
