ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The court of appeals held that respondents could

12

bring this suit under the Administrative Procedure Act to

13

challenge the Bureau of Land Management's ongoing

14

management of vast tracts of public land in Utah divorced

15

from any specifically identifiable agency action that BLM

16

had taken or that BLM was obligated to take but had not.

17

The court of appeals relied on section 706(1) of

18

the APA which authorizes a court to compel agency action

19

unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.

20

The court of appeals decision is contrary to the

21

text of 706(1) which is limited to compelling agency

22

action, not ongoing agency conduct.

23

roots of 706(1) in mandamus, which has historically been

24

limited to the performance -- compelling the performance

25

of what this Court termed in its seminal Kendall decision

It is contrary to the

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

precise and definite acts.

2

generally applicable limitation of judicial review to

3

final agency action, not the sort of evaluation and

4

planning activities at issue here.

5

QUESTION:

It is contrary to the APA's

Well, can -- can we talk about that

6

for a minute?

7

compellable under old mandamus rules without being final

8

agency action in the narrow -- in the narrow sense.

9

Certainly an action can be discrete and be

Let's assume a -- a requirement under -- under

10

the statute that the agency promulgate its regulations by

11

a certain date.

12

that would constitute a failure -- the -- let's say these

13

regulations are -- are general plans of the sort that are

14

at issue here so that they would not give rise to any

15

immediate right of action in that they're not final agency

16

action.

17

be promulgated by a certain date, wouldn't there be a

18

cause of action to require -- you know, 6 months after

19

that date the agency still hasn't come out with the plan.

20

Wouldn't there be a cause of action to compel -­

21

Okay?

Now, I -- I'm -- I'm not sure that

But if the statute says that the agency plan will

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, what you're describing,

22

either regulations or, for example, a land management

23

plan -­

QUESTION:

Right.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

we -- we agree that that is final agency action.

2

not everything that is at issue in this case is non-final,

3

but for example, the -­

4

QUESTION:

Not -­

Well, boy, I -- I think you -- I

5

think you're out of the frying pan into the fire.

I -- I

6

think it's much more useful to the Government to -- to say

7

that -- that a lawsuit can't be brought as soon as the

8

plan is adopted, which it could if you call that final

9

agency action, than it is to say that the failure to

10

promulgate it can be -- cannot be sued upon because the

11

promulgation is not final agency action.

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

Just because something is final

13

agency action doesn't mean it's ripe for judicial review.

14

And that -- that's basically what this Court held in the

15

Ohio Forestry case where it was a challenge to a

16

comparable general land use plan that the Forest Service

17

had promulgated.

18

but the Court said it was not ripe for judicial review

19

because it did not have any immediate consequences on the

20

behavior -- behavior of persons.

21

The plan itself was final agency action,

But the court of appeals in this case allowed

22

706(1) to be used to compel certain conduct that is

23

certainly not -- probably not even agency action, but

24

certainly not final agency action, for example,

25

monitoring.

Some of these plans contemplated that -- that

5

1

BLM personnel would -- would go out and monitor various

2

activities, not surprisingly in -- in the vast tracts of

3

land, and the court said that that could be compelled

4

under 706(1).

5

QUESTION:

Well, this -- the case has sort of a

6

hodgepodge of things in it.

Among other things, there's a

7

claim that the land use plans for San Rafael Mountain and

8

Henry Mountain require certain very specific things, that

9

the land use plan, for instance, for one commits the

10

Bureau of Land Management to finish an off-road vehicle

11

designation rulemaking by 1992 -­

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

13

QUESTION:

It --

-- and another to engage in a

14

separate study as a precursor to the off-road vehicle

15

thing.

16
17
18

Now, those are very specific and with time
deadlines required apparently by rules of the BLM?
MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Well, the -- the latter one

19

you mentioned, the -- is -- is the monitoring activity

20

that I was -- that I was referring to.

21

-- the -- the land management plan -- or excuse me -- a -­

22

an off-road vehicle plan for the Henry Mountain area

23

identified a particular area as something -- an -- an area

24

of possible concern that BLM was expected to monitor.

25

36,000-acre area I -- I believe it was.

And there -- there

QUESTION:

To make a separate study?

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, to -- to monitor and to -­

4

the monitoring showed adverse consequences.

6

study.

7
8

QUESTION:

The -- the

When you say monitor, what -- what

does the BLM look for when it monitors an area?

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it -- someone from the BLM

10

office would go out to the area to look to see whether

11

there's been an increase in, let's say, off-road vehicle

12

use, to -- to inspect whether there's been additional

13

adverse consequences, to see -- to perhaps watch how

14

people are using the area.

15

and -- and law enforcement type activity that -- that is

16

-- is not normally something that a private person

17

could -­

18

QUESTION:

And that's typical oversight

Well, how about the other one, that

19

the BLM has to finish its off-road vehicle use designation

20

rulemaking by 1992?

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

That -- that's not actually a -­

22

a formal rulemaking.

And what -- what the -- what the

23

plan, the resource management plan, for the San Rafael

24

area contemplated was -- was a whole chart of activities

25

that the BLM intended to do into the future.

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

The -- FLPMA, the statute at issue here,

2

identifies resource management plans as designed to

3

project present and future uses.

4

that means laying out a general schedule, but the agency

5

is not thereby imposing on itself a mandatory duty that is

6

enforceable by any member of the public to require it to

7

adhere to its schedule.

8
9

QUESTION:

Project, and that -­

Why isn't that a defense?

That is,

they say that what these provisions mean is you promised

10

to monitor this area and you didn't.

11

it did mean that or you think it -- so you -- that's the

12

defense.

13

promised to promulgate this in 1992.

14

dah, dah, dah, dah.

And you -- and -- and you say that

15

isn't what it says.

Fine, but if they're right about what

16

it says, can't they bring an action in court?

17

But suppose they're right.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Now, you don't think

They say you
That's what it says,

emphasize are just one minor aspect of the broader

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

the court of appeals in this case held that based on a

10

provision of FLPMA, which says that management actions

11

shall be in conformity with the land use plan, that that

statutory provision obligates the Bureau of Land

13

Management to carry out every activity identified in the

plan.

provision.

16

The court of appeals relied on a statutory

19

to be consistent with general standards in the plan, but

20

it -- but it does -- in other words, the standards set the

outer boundaries for what will happen in the future.

Those two things were not done.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Therefore,

Now, as to those two

Yes.

Okay.

Because.

Because why?

Because land -- a land management

10

plan is something quite different from a regulation.

11

a land management plan is -- is an identification by the

12

agency of how -- how it expects things to unfold, again to

13

project what's going to happen in the future.

14

imposing on itself a legally binding obligation that is in

15

turn enforceable by any private party.

16

QUESTION:

A -­

It is not

But why -- why isn't that simply a

defense?

18

the -- of the plan as -- as being ultimately nonbinding,

19

as being precatory on the agency as -- as a jurisdictional

20

peg to say nobody can even get into court and claim that

21

they are not following their own rule.

22

see how you get from the one point, i.e., the nature of

23

the plan as precatory, to the jurisdictional point.

24
25

I mean, you're -- you're taking the nature of

MR. KNEEDLER:

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Did that have anything

We didn't join the motion to

10

pointed out, the arguments that -- that we're making here

11

and that the intervenor made in the motion to dismiss,

were made in -- in opposition to the motion for

14

stage.

15

And the district court -­
QUESTION:

But that would go to the relief or -­

or to the -- whether they have a -- a claim for relief.

17

It wouldn't go to a jurisdictional question.

MR. KNEEDLER:

But -- but it also -- it -- it

went to whether the district court should enter a

preliminary injunction in the first -- if -- if there was

21

no basis under 706(1) for the court to entertain the case,

that would certainly be a basis for denying the

MR. KNEEDLER:

5

QUESTION:

If it did, is it actionable possibly?

6

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- it might be, but that would

7

depend on how the plan -- the particular plan was worded.

8

But BLM has never understood the plans that it is -- that

9

is has adopted here to be imposing on itself legal duties

10

that it owes to the public.

11

QUESTION:

Well, I thought you acknowledged that

12

it -- that it imposes some legal duties; that is to say,

13

that if -- if the agency took action, took affirmative

14

action, which would destroy its ability to follow through

15

on the plan, you know, allowed development in a certain

16

area that the plan anticipated would be left undeveloped,

17

that an injunction would lie for that.

18

-- no?

I thought that's

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

20

way that would operate.

21

against which future agency actions are to be measured.

would be a standard against which a timber sale, a

MR. KNEEDLER:

It's not final agency action.

MR. KNEEDLER:

There -- there are two points.

said, all right, they -- they could, in fact, adopt

provisions that are very hard-edged and have absolute

7

obligating themselves to do is not final agency action,

would not be the subject of an affirmative order.

MR. KNEEDLER:

Section 704 of the APA says -- limits

judicial review to final agency action, and we think that

21

applies to both 706(1) and 706(2).

logic of 706(2), as we explain in the Attorney General's

MR. SMITH:

No.

This is an entirely plan-based

2

claim in this case, Your Honor, and our claim was that

3

this plan, read as a whole, taking into account not just

4

this page but the text on page 154 as well, was fairly

5

read as a binding commitment that they would do this task

They did it in 19 -- in 2003.

9

exercise -­

10

As it turned out, they did it in 12 years.

QUESTION:

They finally designated

Well, supposing in -- on page 162

11

instead of saying within 1 year, they had said within 12

14

Would you have had any better case?

MR. SMITH:

If they had said that they were

19

-- that the BLM sets for itself.

7

the NEPA requirement that they take a hard look at -- at

the environmental impact statement requirement when -­

10

QUESTION:

Mr. Smith, can I -- I -- your opening

11

statement was that it's implausible that there should be

12

some duties upon agencies that are not enforceable in the

13

courts.

14

don't understand the role of the courts to be to oversee

15

executive action.

16

committees that do that.

courts to be to vindicate individual rights when they have

19

I don't find that implausible at all.

I -- I

You have congressional oversight
I understood the role of the

And what the Government is saying here is that

20

no individual right has been violated until there has been

21

final agency action.

22

-- it's -- it's an action that changes the law, that

23

establishes requirements.

24

no individual right.

25

Final agency action is what confers

And until that happens, there's

I'm not willing to accept your proposition that

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- that the role of courts is to make sure that agencies

2

tow the line.

3

It's not ours at all.

4

That's -- that's the President's role.

MR. SMITH:

Well, Your Honor, what makes their

5

-- their position implausible is what Congress actually

6

did in the Administrative Procedure Act where it very

7

specifically said that -- that courts have the power to

8

compel agency action unlawfully withheld and unreasonably

9

delayed.

10

QUESTION:

It's based -- nobody thought that the

11

APA radically changed the course of -- of judicial review

12

of administrative action, which had been based on the

13

prerogative writs such as mandamus and which required an

14

individual right that had been harmed and -- and a

15

mandatory duty to that individual.

16

MR. SMITH:

17

QUESTION:

And -- and -­
And one can violate the -- the

18

directives of Congress without -- without harming any

19

individual, and when that happens, it's up to the

20

congressional committees to bring the agency back into

21

compliance, not -- not these courts.

22

MR. SMITH:

With respect, Your Honor, I think

23

the concept that decides who gets to bring the lawsuit is

24

the concept of standing, not the concept of individual

25

rights.

And it's no -- there is no argument here that

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the plaintiffs lacked standing under this Court's

2

decisions to enforce this mandatory obligation of the

3

agencies to avoid impairment.

4

the right way to think about it.

5

And so I think that that's

And if you look at the -- the finality concept

6

and the right role it should be playing here, it's the

7

inaction that has to be final, not the action that you're

8

seeking to compel.

9

statutory text puts the word final in the wrong section.

It's -- their -- their reading of the

10

Finality comes up under section 704 which says final

11

agency action is subject to judicial review.

12

action, in turn, is defined as including failure to act.

13

So as the courts, since the APA has -- was first brought

14

out, have consistently said you look at whether the

15

inaction is sufficiently final to decide this is the right

16

time to bring a lawsuit.

17

QUESTION:

Agency

I think all the Government is saying

18

is that the inaction like the action has to be inaction

19

which causes remediable harm to the individual.

20

MR. SMITH:

21

QUESTION:

Absolutely.
Just as that doesn't happen with

22

action unless it's final, the Government says it doesn't

23

happen with inaction -- with inaction unless what you're

24

seeking to compel is something that would have conferred

25

upon you something you have a right to have.

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SMITH:

Well, two points, Your Honor.

First

2

of all, I don't disagree that the concept of harm is a key

3

part of how you decide whether or not the inaction is

4

sufficiently final to bring a lawsuit.

5

several things, whether the Congress imposed a deadline or

6

a continuous duty, as they did here, whether there's

7

irreparable harm, whether the agency is operating under a

8

misunderstanding of the statute that is involved.

9

courts say in those situations, the practical concept of

10

finality is used to decide this inaction is sufficiently

11

serious that we're going to allow review now.

QUESTION:

But if you petitioned for an action,

that is, you asked the agency to close this area, and they

There is no -- they -- what the BLM has done instead over

MR. SMITH:

QUESTION:

Yes.
That's your view.

So then as it was

when the case was brought, what you want is a change in

the wording of the governing documents which I'm thinking

5

of as land use plan.

6

MR. SMITH:

Yes.

Is that yes or no?

We -- we want an exercise of the

7

emergency closure which would effectively amount to the

8

same thing.

9

QUESTION:

Okay.

Now, my question then -- and

10

that's what I thought you wanted -- is why isn't the thing

11

to do, if that's the kind of relief you want, to file a

12

piece of paper over at the BLM and say, we want this

document amended because it seems to me that this document

14

has the status of a rule and every agency -- every agency

15

-- has a procedure through which you can request an

16

amendment of a rule.

17

procedure rather than to come into court and say we want a

18

judge to do it first in the first instance?

MR. SMITH:

act on -- in -- in accordance with its own statutory and

2

regulatory obligations.

3

And it says, we just wanted to point out to you

4

there's all this irreparable harm going on.

There's ORV's

5

rampant in these wilderness areas, and as you well know -­

6

this is in the middle of the first paragraph -- 43 C.F.R.,

7

section 8341.2 -- that's the one I was talking about

8

before -- directs BLM managers to immediately close areas

9

suffering considerable adverse effects from ORV use and

10

abuse.

So we brought it to the agency's attention, and

11

they, as -- as they have done throughout the period,

12

simply didn't do anything.

13

QUESTION:

So if in fact this is the equivalent

14

of the kind of document I said, then why wouldn't your

things and you can sue them.

equitable discretion.

we're not going to order that because there are 16 other

exercise -- and the D.C. Circuit case law is quite

They

The courts do have a lot of

10

sophisticated on this subject -- to decide whether they

11

want to enforce in the way that is being requested.

12

All we're saying is if there's a duty under the

13

statute or under the -- the plan, the plan isn't amended,

14

it ought to be something that you can get into court and

15

let the judge look at and decide whether this is an

16

appropriate duty to enforce at this time.

17

QUESTION:

But how could the judge look at it

18

without knowing all the other things that are on the

19

agency's table given the limited resources?

20

BLM's answer here was we realize that the environmental

21

impact statement is out of date, and over a period of

22

years, we're going to update those statements.

23

frankly, we haven't got the money to do it for every place

now.

hearing on this thing.

may well be cause of action.

QUESTION:

We were dismissed at the -- the

It

I mean, if -- if we imagine coming

6

into court, then would everything that's on the agency's

7

plate have to be presented to the court?

8

MR. SMITH:

It would depend on the particular

9

duty at issue and the kinds of harms that are at issue.

10

Here we have a specific mandate that says maintain these

11

places which you, BLM, has -- have designated so Congress

12

will have the prerogative to make the wilderness areas

13

when it looks at it.

14

specific duty and severe irreparable harm that will happen

15

if the BLM doesn't make it a priority.

16

situations, the Federal courts are much more likely to say

17

we are going to grant some relief in this -- we are going

18

to force the BLM, or whoever it is, to follow the

19

statutory obligations.

20

when the agency comes in and says, well, we have 66 other

21

things like this we should be doing, the courts are much

22

less likely to do that.

23

It's -- it's got a very clear,

In those

In many other kinds of situations,

We're just saying that there has to be a power

24

in the Federal courts at some point to compel adherence to

25

the law when all of the other requirements are set,

standing, finality, a clear mandatory duty which is

2

perhaps better defined in the regulations, as you have

3

here, all of these things, that if you don't have the -­

4

the residual power in the courts to take action at some

5

point when the violation gets sufficiently serious and

harmful, then the -- the provision really isn't

enforceable at all.

14

17

I mean, you know, let's assume the FCC is not
It's not -- it's not indeed, regulating

It's violating its congressional mandate.

Certainly you can't.

MR. SMITH:

Well, that's a perfect example, Your

18

Honor, of why this issue only arises in certain narrow

19

circumstances because the FCC takes affirmative agency

20

actions all the time and you can challenge those as being

21

arbitrary and capricious and outside the statutory

22

requirements.

23

The difficulty we were facing here was the

24

absence of any action to challenge.

The agency was using

25

its own inaction as its defense to being challenged for -­

3

That's their -- their ultimate

QUESTION:

Is -- is one way to characterize what

4

the Government is saying is that they require that every

5

inaction has some sort of a mirror image in action?

6

that's a little a bit hard for me to work with.

7

MR. SMITH:

Right.

And

And -- and the -- the

8

drafters of the APA really did say we think inaction is

9

sometimes action and that that can be final enough that

10

you can challenge it.

11

the court said and that's what they have done for the last

12

50 years under the APA.

13

inaction sufficiently serious, sufficiently unlawful that

14

we're going to allow a 706(1) kind of claim to proceed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

22

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

23

MR. KNEEDLER:

24

We think that this case is really controlled by

25

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation, which really was

52
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the mirror image of this case.

2

which plaintiffs sought to challenge again conduct of BLM

3

on a programmatic basis, saying that BLM, with respect to

4

vast tracts of land, had not taken action that -- that the

5

plaintiffs thought it should take.

6

that, no, such a suit must focus on not only agency

7

action, discrete action, but final agency action, and you

8

can't bring about wholesale change in an agency program

9

under 706(2).

10

It was a situation in

And this Court held

It follows, we think, a fortiori under 706(1)

11

that that cannot be done because 706(1) is essentially

12

ancillary to 706(2).

13

to disgorge final agency action if it has a legal

14

obligation to do it so that once that final agency action

15

is issued, it can be reviewed under the central provision

16

of the APA, section 706(2).

17

It is designed to require the agency

706(1) is limited to compelling that sort of

18

action and putting the courts in the position where they

19

can then review final agency action in the way the

20

Administrative Procedure Act contemplates, which is on the

21

basis of the agency's decision, the agency's finding of

22

fact, its application of law and policy to fact and its

23

rationale.

24
25

So this is not just a matter of form.

We think

that the difference between the lawsuit that plaintiffs

53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

have brought and the lawsuit that the APA contemplates is

2

critical to the relationship between agencies and courts

3

under the APA and under the separation of powers under the

4

Constitution.

5

Plaintiffs' vision would put the courts in the

6

position in the first instance of finding whether there's

7

been compliance with the statutory standards.

8

and the way the APA requires is to submit a request for a

9

particular order or regulation, let the agency act, and

10

Our view

then review that discrete controversy.

11

All three of the claims in this case that the

12

plaintiffs have brought would reflect a radical departure

13

from that view.

14

The first is to compel compliance with a general

15

statutory standard to manage lands in a particular way.

16

Management is not agency action.

17

which this Court said in Lujan could not be reviewed.

18

It's like a program,

The claim to require NEPA statements is

19

independent, not tied to any proposed major Federal

20

action.

21

programs.

22

They're claiming an ongoing duty to update NEPA

And with respect to the land management program

23

-- plans, no court has ever held since FLPMA was enacted

24

and these plans have been utilized that they impose on BLM

25

a duty owed to members of the public to comply with

54
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

schedules, tentative, anticipated schedules, as this

2

document says, of what will be carried out in the future.

3

This is not just a question of standing and zone of

4

interest which private people might be able to sue.

5

more fundamental than that.

6

duties owed to any member of the public because they are

7

designed for internal management by the agency.

8

10

These plans do not impose any

We are in no way saying that what BLM does is
beyond judicial review, but the plaintiffs are required to
follow the right procedures.

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- what the -- what the

17

respondents did not do was wait for BLM to respond, and in

18

fact, in March of 2000, before the PI hearing was even

19

held in this case, BLM issued a closure order that closed

20

six out of those seven orders and left -- areas and left

21

one of them open.

22

And SUWA never challenged that.

Justice O'Connor, you referred to pictures in
