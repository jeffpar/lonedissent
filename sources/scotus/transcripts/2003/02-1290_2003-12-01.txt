ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. KNEEDLER: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:

11

The Ninth Circuit held in this case that the

12

United States Postal Service may be sued for treble

13

damages under the Federal antitrust laws.

14

appeals fundamentally erred in this holding.

15

the nation's history, postal operations have been carried

16

out by the United States Government itself, pursuant to

17

the express authorization in article I of the

18

Constitution, for Congress to establish post offices and

19

post roads.

20

The court of
Throughout

As this Court explained in the Council of

21

Greenburgh case about 20 years ago, the furnishing of

22

postal services has historically been regarded as a

23

sovereign function, indeed a sovereign necessity, to

24

promote intercourse among the states and bind the nation

25

together.

Such functions of the United States Government

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

are not regulated by the antitrust laws.
Indeed, more than 60 years ago, in the Cooper

3

Corporation case, this Court held that the United States

4

is not a person for purposes of the antitrust laws.

5

Although the precise question before the Court in that

6

case was whether the United States could sue as a

7

plaintiff under section 7 of the Sherman Act, the Court

8

noted that the same word, person, is used to describe who

9

may be held liable as a defendant, either in a civil

10

action or in a criminal prosecution.

11

QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, in your view, are there

12

any instrumentalities of the United States that you think

13

could be considered a person under the Sherman Act?

14

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I - I think that there are

15

no instrumentalities that are constituent parts of the

16

United States Government itself that could - that could be

17

held liable.

18

somewhat vague sense, elastic sense, and I think it would

19

be necessary to look at the particular statute to see how

20

much of a governmental character a particular entity has.

21

The word instrumentality is used in a - in a

QUESTION: Of course, I guess the court whose

22

judgment we're reviewing thought that the change in the

23

structure of the Postal Service affected the nature of

24

that instrumentality.

25

MR. KNEEDLER: It - it - it did, but the - the

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

court of appeals was wrong on that.

2

the - the court of - after the - this Court's Cooper

3

decision, a number of lower court decisions have held,

4

beginning with the D.C. Circuit's decision in the Sea-

5

Land case involving the Alaska Railroad, that agencies of

6

the United States or instrumentalities just like the

7

United States itself is not a person subject to the

8

antitrust laws.

9

First of all, after

The Ninth Circuit didn't -

QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler - Mr. Kneedler, but I

10

don't think in that case there was - the question was

11

raised whether the Alaska Railroad was an agent of the

12

United States that would - would carry the immunity of the

13

United States.

14

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, the - the - it was - the

15

Court regarded it as an - as an instrumentality, and in

16

fact the - the Court there recognized that the railroad

17

and the officials of the Government responsible for

18

supervising the railroad could be sued under the APA, and

19

that, therefore, there had been a waiver of sovereign

20

immunity to that extent, and to the extent of allowing

21

injunctive relief.

22

on the question that the Alaska Railroad and those

23

responsible for managing it were part of the United States

24

Government.

25

So the - the Court certainly focused

QUESTION: I didn't think it was a contested

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

issue in - in that case.
MR. KNEEDLER: It may not have been contested,

3

but it - but it - the Court certainly addressed that

4

question and then went on to hold that as an

5

instrumentality of the United States, the - the railroad

6

was not subject to suit under the antitrust law.

7
8
9

QUESTION: Is the Postal Service subject to the
Administrative Procedure Act?
MR. KNEEDLER: It is not.

It - it - Congress

10

specifically accepted it that there's - in section 410 of

11

the act, there's a very detailed enumeration of the

12

provisions that Congress did want and did not want to be -

13

the Postal Service to be subject to.

But the - the

14

important point for present purposes is that in 1970, when

15

Congress enacted the Postal Reorganization Act, it carried

16

forward the essential governmental character of the Postal

17

Service, just as it had been up until that point.

18

In fact, section 101(a) of the act says that the

19

United States - and I quote - the United States Postal

20

Service shall be operated as a basic and fundamental

21

service provided to the people by the Government of the

22

United States.

23

have as its basic function the obligation to provide

24

postal services to bind the nation together.

25

And then it says, the Postal Service shall

QUESTION: So you say it carried forward the -

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the essential governmental character.

2

that consist of?

3

entity, not just - just the - the tag?

4

a tag on it and - and say it has an essentially

5

governmental character.

6

purpose of the reorganization was to make the Postal

7

Service function like a regular business.

8
9

Doesn't it consist of the nature of the
It can't just put

I thought that the - that the

MR. KNEEDLER: In - in a - in a limited sense.
Congress -

10
11

What - what does

QUESTION: Well, I'll - I'll qualify it.

A

regular business, a regular public utility -

12

MR. KNEEDLER: No, I - I -

13

QUESTION: - which has - which has certain

14

obligations, yes.

15

mail service, just as a telephone company has to give

16

universal telephone service.

17

rest of their operations were supposed to be business-

18

like.

19

They have to do universal - universal

But on the other hand, the

MR. KNEEDLER: In the - in the description of -

20

of how the Postal Service was to be operated carrying

21

forward, the - the Congress repeatedly referred to the

22

Postal Service as - as a governmental function, a public

23

service to be operated in a business-like way.

24

Congress meant by that was to insulate the Postal Service

25

from the prior political interference that had come up by

But what

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

imposing the duty on Congress to repeatedly raise rates

2

and - and address services.

3

QUESTION: Insulated from the Government.

4

MR. KNEEDLER: Not - but by -

5

QUESTION: You're - you're saying on the one hand

6

it's part of the Government, but on the other hand, what

7

Congress wanted to do was to insulate it from the

8

Government.

9

MR. KNEEDLER: No.

By - by no means insulate it

10

from the Government.

11

of the Postal Service are denominated officers of the

12

United States, so the people responsible for the Postal

13

Service are officers of the United States.

14
15

The Postal Service - the governors

QUESTION: Are they - are they removable by the
President?

16

MR. KNEEDLER: They're removable for cause.

17

QUESTION: For cause.

18

Just like the heads of

independent agencies.

19

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, but - but certainly the other

20

independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and

21

agencies like that are part of the United States

22

Government performing a governmental function.

23

QUESTION: Congress never said that they were

24

supposed to operate like a business, which was the purpose

25

of the Reorganization Act.

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KNEEDLER: Actually, in the - in the text of

2

the act itself, there - there is - there is not an express

3

directive that the Postal Service will be operated like a

4

commercial entity.

5

to rationalize the internal operations of the Postal

6

Service, but it did not change any of the fundamental ways

7

in which the Postal Service operated.

8

the postal monopoly, which, under the private express

9

statutes, about 80 percent of the revenues of the Postal

What Congress had in mind was to - was

It - it maintained

10

Service are - are protected by the private express -

11

QUESTION: It - it did - it did retain that

12

monopoly and - and the Government's position here is that

13

the Postal Service has the power to extend that monopoly

14

into fields that the Government did not specifically

15

confer upon it, right?

16

as I understand it, is not only that the Postal Service

17

can't be sued under the antitrust laws, but that the -

18

that the Postal Service is not subject to the antitrust

19

laws.

20
21
22

Because the Government's position,

MR. KNEEDLER: It is not a person within the
meaning of the antitrust laws.
QUESTION: So it can - it can go ahead and extend

23

the monopoly conferred by statute beyond the - the narrow

24

context granted by Congress.

25

MR. KNEEDLER: That is not a - that is not a new

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

feature of the - of the Postal Service.

2

in our reply brief, quoting this Court's decision in the

3

Emergency Fleet Corporation case, there the Court pointed

4

out, with respect to the Post Office, it said the Post

5

Office has since 1872 competed with bankers through money

6

orders, it competed with savings and loan association

7

through savings accounts, which the Postal Service

8

operated -

9

As we point out

QUESTION: Suppose there - suppose there were an

10

actionable violation of the antitrust laws and there was a

11

conspiracy between two private suppliers, and the Postal

12

Service, through some of its high officers, joined that

13

conspiracy.

14

liability, on the part of the officers of the Postal

15

Service?

16

Would there be any liability, individual

MR. KNEEDLER: I - I'm not sure about that.

The

17

Postal Service itself would not be - would not be liable,

18

and I - and I think if the - I guess it depends on what

19

one means by a - by a conspiracy as well, because if the -

20

the Postal Service has brought authority in procurement,

21

for example, to - it's exempt from some of the Federal

22

procurement statutes, but Congress granted it the

23

authority to have its own procurement arrangements.

24

the - if - if a - if the Postmaster General decides on a

25

particular procurement methodology that - that was alleged

So if

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to be anti-competitive, I don't think that could be fairly

2

characterized as a conspiracy, even -

3
4

QUESTION: Is the private express statute still
in effect?

5

MR. KNEEDLER: It is, it is, and that has - that

6

has not been changed, and the Court discussed that in the

7

California Board of Regents case and other - and other

8

decisions of this Court.

9

Circuit relied upon in - in this case was the presence of

10

a sue-and-be-sued clause in the Postal Reorganization Act,

11

which simply says that the Postal Service may sue and be

12

sued in its official name.

13

Really, the - all the Ninth

There is a - there is virtually no discussion of

14

that provision in the legislative history of the act, and

15

the Ninth Circuit essentially said that because the Postal

16

Service may sue - may be sued in its official name,

17

therefore, it has - its sovereign character has been cast

18

off and it can be sued just like a private party.

19

That - that analysis is in direct conflict with

20

this Court's decision in FDIC v. Meyer, where the Court

21

reversed a similar determination with respect to the FDIC,

22

saying that the Ninth Circuit had conflated what are two

23

analytically distinct questions.

24

there is a waiver of sovereign immunity.

25

dispute that there is a waiver of sovereign immunity here

The first is whether
We do not

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

under the sue-and-be-sued clause.

2

and critical question here is whether the - the

3

substantive law that the plaintiff relies upon provides an

4

avenue for relief.

5

But the - the second

In this case, that is the antitrust laws, and

6

Congress has never amended the antitrust laws to make an

7

agency or an entity of the United States Government

8

liable.

9

Corporation, Congress amended the Clayton Act to allow the

10

United States to sue as a plaintiff if it's injured in its

11

business or property, but it did not do that by changing

12

the word person.

13

action for the United States as the United States, but it

14

did not, as the D.C. Circuit pointed out in the Sea-Land

15

case, amend the definition of person or otherwise make the

16

United States or its constituent parts subject to the

17

antitrust laws as a - as a defendant.

After the decision in Cooper - Cooper

It - it explicitly provided a cause of

18

QUESTION: What happens - I'm sorry, go on.

19

QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, is this - section 201 of

20

Title 39 says, there is established as an independent

21

establishment of the executive branch of the Government of

22

the United States the United States Post Office.

23

in the statute before the reorganization or is that part

24

of the reorganization?

25

Was that

MR. KNEEDLER: That's part of the reorganization.

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

There was a Post Office Department before that was part of

2

the Cabinet, and what - what Congress wanted to do was to

3

take the post - postal operations out of the Cabinet and

4

put them under - under the Board of Governors, who are

5

officers of the United States but not part of the Cabinet.

6

And the - the phrase, establishment of the executive

7

branch, is used with respect to other undeniably Federal

8

agencies, as we point out in our - in our brief, the OPM,

9

Office of Personnel Management, the Transportation Safety

10
11

Board.
And I - I think it's just intended to make

12

clearer that the Postal Service was not to be under the

13

President's direct control, and in fact there were

14

proposals to make the Postal Service a corporation, and

15

Congress emphatically rejected that.

16

President Nixon proposed in - in submitting a proposal to

17

Congress, the Postal Service would be constituted as an

18

agency like the SEC or NASA or the Board of Governors of

19

the Federal Reserve System.

20

are performing quintessentially governmental functions

21

that are not subject to the antitrust laws.

And instead, as

All of those entities are -

22

QUESTION: If I get into a car accident with a -

23

with a postal delivery truck, do I sue the United States

24
25

under the Federal tort claims?
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes, yes, you do.

And - and -

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it's - it's an important thing to - to be clear about in

2

the Postal Reorganization Act.

that statute, Congress treated the Postal Service as a

governmental entity.

come to pay the judgment?

13

Is it -

MR. KNEEDLER: Out of the - out of the Postal
Service fund, but that is a fund in the Treasury.

There's

a separate provision -

11
12

The torts are subject to the Federal

QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, where does the money

8
9

Pervasively throughout

QUESTION: But it isn't the general judgment
fund?
MR. KNEEDLER: No - no, it's - no, it's not, but

14

- but there are other - other situations in which

15

appropriated funds from a particular agency are used to

16

reimburse the judgment fund if there's a particular

17

appropriation set aside for that purpose, so this is not a

18

unique feature of - of the - of the Postal Act.

19

But if I could also mention, torts are subject

20

to suit against the United States, but with respect to

21

contracts, Congress subjected the Postal Service to the

22

Contract Disputes Act.

23

years ago, soon after the act was passed, that the United

24

States itself could be sued under the Tucker Act based on

25

a breach of contract with the Postal Service, because of

The Court of Claims held almost 20

the close connection between the Postal Service and the

2

United States.

3

The Postal Service could be sued in district

4

court in its own name under the sue-and-be-sued clause for

5

breach of contract, but the Court of Claims held that -

6

that the United States itself can be sued, and therefore

7

is responsible for the contracts of - of the Postal

8

Service, and it -

9

QUESTION: Could the United States sue - bring an

10

antitrust suit as plaintiff on behalf of the Postal

11

Service?

12

MR. KNEEDLER: We - we believe it could.

It

13

would - it would be brought in its own name, but - but the

14

United States - if the Postal Service, just like any other

15

entity, purchased goods, for example, and was a victim of

16

- of a - of a - of an antitrust violation, the United

17

States would be able to sue and - and collect treble

18

damages.

19

case, where there was a procurement of tires by a number

20

of different Federal agencies, and Congress authorized the

21

United States to bring a suit to recover for the injuries

22

sustained to Federal agencies generally in that situation.

23

That was the purpose of the Cooper Corporation

QUESTION: Under this sue-and-be-sued clause, is

24

it your position that there must always be a Federal

25

statute authorizing the suit before the post office has

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

any substantive liability?

2

MR. KNEEDLER: As a general rule, yes.

There -

3

before the Federal Tort Claims Act was passed though, it

4

was assumed that tort claims could be brought against

5

Federal entities that had sue-and-be-sued clauses,

6

although a lot of those were private corporations that

7

were instrumentalities, not - not Federal agencies.

8

also with respect -

9
10

And

QUESTION: So the sue-and-be-sued clause does
have some substantive force in some other cases?

11

MR. KNEEDLER: It's - it's been - it's unclear

12

because back when they were first put in the - in the

13

statutes, the - the separation of a - the existence of a

14

waiver of sovereign immunity and the existence of a cause

15

of action were - were not separated the way they are

16

today.

17

plaintiff can bring a breach of contract action against

18

the United States, even though there's no statute that

19

specifically provides a cause of action for breach of

20

contract.

21

contracts in the Tucker Act is a sufficient basis for

22

that, and we -

23
24
25

For example, under the - under the Tucker Act, a

It's thought that - that the reference to

QUESTION: Does the Post Office have the power of
eminent domain?
MR. KNEEDLER: It does, it does, and it has - it

1

- it carries forward the power to investigate postal

2

offenses, to - to - with appropriate authorization, to

3

search the mails.

QUESTION: There's a lot of -

5

QUESTION: What about - what about inverse

6

condemnation?

7

without the ability to pay for it.

8
9

Supposing the post office takes property

MR. KNEEDLER: I don't know that the question has
arisen, but I - I would assume that a - a suit could be

10

brought against the United States under the Tucker Act on

11

the same theory that I mentioned with respect to a breach

12

of contract by the Postal Service.

13

QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler -

14

QUESTION: Don't - before we get off of eminent

15

domain, don't - don't a lot of state public utility

16

entities have the power of eminent domain?

17

MR. KNEEDLER: They - they do, and that -

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I - I think it's part of an

had a cause of action, in fact, brought one under the

11

Administrative Disputes Resolution Act that is essentially

12

a bid protest statute.

13

And there are two features of that statute that

14

are inconsistent with antitrust liability in this setting.

15

First of all, Congress expressly provided that the

16

standard of review in such an action is the arbitrary and

17

capricious standard of the APA, meaning that the Postal

18

Service, like any other Federal agency subject to that,

19

has to have broad latitude -

20

QUESTION: It seems to me, Mr. Kneedler, this is

21

an argument that you don't have an antitrust violation

22

here, but we're concerned with the problem of whether you

23

had a classic violation, say they agreed with somebody

24

else on the prices they would charge for advertising the

25

Olympics or something like that, where you had a clear -

1

here you don't have it clear.

2

whether the alleged violation - but that's not the issue

3

before us.

4

I think it's arguable

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, except - except to this

5

extent.

6

looking on how - on how disputes involving the Postal

7

Service are handled, you find a governmental dispute

8

resolution mechanism, and that - this was the point about

9

the -

10
11

QUESTION: But what about a breach of infringement of patents, for example?

12
13

MR. KNEEDLER: There's - there's express
authorization for suing the United States for -

14
15

QUESTION: And infringement of copyrights and so
forth?

16
17

In - in virtually every direction you turn, in

MR. KNEEDLER: Same - same thing.

Where Congress

has wanted to provide the United -

18

QUESTION: Supposing there was a - one of these

19

antitrust violations that involved abuses of patents in

20

order to extend a monopoly or something like that, that

21

could be a classic antitrust violation.

22

are other Federal remedies there?

But you say there

23

MR. KNEEDLER: There - there might be - there

24

might be remedies under some of the statutes mentioned

25

here.

There - I mean, Congress has expressly subjected

1

the United States to suit under the Lanham Act, under the

2

copyright statute, under - under the trademark laws, under

3

the patent laws, but - and - and then there are these

4

procurement statutes that I mentioned that are applicable

5

in this particular case.

6

Congress did not provide for treble damages.

7

monetary relief a plaintiff could get in this procurement

8

situation, as we point out in our brief under the

9

Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, is bid preparation

10

But in this case as well,
The only

costs, not treble damages.

11

QUESTION: What if - what if the Post Office buys

12

a lot of paper from somebody and doesn't pay for it?

13

What's - what is the remedy of that person on a contract?

14

MR. KNEEDLER: There would be an alternative

15

remedies.

16

the Postal Service could have been sued itself in its own

17

name under the sue-and-be-sued clause, or in the Tuck -

18

under the Tucker Act in the - in the Court of Claims.

19

under the Contract Disputes Act, Congress has made that

20

statute applicable to the Postal Service just as it has to

21

other Federal entities.

22
23
24
25

Before the Contract Disputes Act was passed,

Now

QUESTION: And that could be - that sort of an
action could be brought under the Contract Disputes Act?
MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

And there is specifically a

Postal Service board of contract appeals, just there - as

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there is a board of contract appeals in - in other

2

agencies.

3

QUESTION: Would there be an - some alternative

4

remedy to the antitrust law if the Postal Service decided

5

to use its profits from the monopoly business in effect to

6

subsidize predatory rates in the package delivery business

7

in order to put UPS out of business?

8
9
10

MR. KNEEDLER: The way - the way Congress
addressed that was to subject the Postal Service to the
jurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, and all -

11

QUESTION: Well, let's assume they go along with

12

it.

13

there be any alternative claim - source of remedy by UPS

14

to the antitrust laws?

15
16

They say, okay, we are going to eliminate UPS.

Would

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, I would - I would - if the a decision - it's a complicated mechanism the way the

17

Postal Rate Commission interacts with the Postal Service,

18

but there is a provision for judicial review.

19

Postal Service enters a final decision after - after

20

receiving the input from the Postal Rate Commission, there

21

is a provision for judicial review of that - of

22

determinations of -

If the

23

QUESTION: What would be the -

24

MR. KNEEDLER:

25

QUESTION: What would be the substantive basis

- rates and classifications.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for the review?
MR. KNEEDLER: Under - under the Postal

3

Reorganization Act, the provisions beginning in - in

4

section 3601 of the act address rate-making and

5

classification, and there are specific standards there

6

that the Postal Rate Commission and the Postal Service

7

must adhere to.

10

QUESTION: And - and would it eliminate this
possibility of predatory lowing - lowering rates for MR. KNEEDLER: They - they are designed to.

The

11

- the - the way the - the way the act operates, it

12

specifies that each classification - first - two things:

13

one, overall, the Postal Service rates are to be set at a

14

rate so that they - the income will roughly equal

15

expenditures.

16

provided the direct and indirect costs of that class are

17

to be allocated to it, along with some - an appropriate

18

portion of the institutional costs, the things that are

19

difficult to - to allocate to any one - any one class.

20

And then within each class, Congress has

QUESTION: Of course, this only becomes a real

21

problem when the Postal Service turns a profit on its

22

monopoly business, which it has not yet succeeded in

23

doing, has it?

24
25

MR. KNEEDLER: Well, and - and it's not - over
the long term, over the long term since the Postal

Reorganization Act, I believe that the Postal Service is

within about a billion dollars of breaking even.

are times when it is in a deficit.

4

it is in a surplus, but the statutory goal is that it -

5

that it be roughly equal balance between - between income

6

and expenditures.

There

There are times when

7

QUESTION: Mr. Kneedler, can I ask you a basic

8

question I just kind of forgotten that I thought I knew

9

about, but I thought the Postal Service had a monopoly of

10

the business of delivering letters and packages, and that

11

these competing services are only allowed to exist by some

12

special privilege granted by the Postal Service.

13
14

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

That's true for letters, but

not for parcel post.

15

QUESTION: But not for parcel, I see.

16

MR. KNEEDLER: Yes.

There's - there's an - the

17

Postal Service adopted an exception to the private express

18

statutes for urgent letters, which - which has allowed

19

organizations like Federal Express to carry letters for

20

urgent delivery.

21

practice would be prohibited by the - by the private

22

express statutes.

23

Absent that exception, they would - that

But the - the idea that the Postal Service

24

competes with non-Federal entities is not new.

25

I pointed out, the Postal Service began competing with

As I - as

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

money orders before the turn of the last century, for 50

2

years have had savings deposits with up to 4 million

3

depositors that competed with savings associations, so and

4

- and it's competed - it went into the parcel post

5

business, the parcel delivery business in 1913 alongside

6

of other businesses.

7

So that - that sort of competition with private

8

businesses has - has occurred since well before the Postal

9

Reorganization Act, and nothing in the Postal

10

Reorganization Act changes the way in which that should be

11

regarded under the - under the antitrust laws.

12
13

If the Court has no further questions, I'd like
to reserve the balance of my time.

14

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Kneedler.

15

Mr. Krent, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HAROLD J. KRENT

17

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

18
19
20

MR. KRENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
As Justice Scalia noted, Congress launched the

21

Postal Service into the commercial world in 1970,

22

authorizing it to compete in any market of its own

23

choosing, and this new commercial entity fits comfortably

24

within the term, person, under the antitrust laws for at

25

least four distinct reasons.

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

First, this is unlike any other Federal entity

2

in the fact that the Postal Service has been authorized to

3

decide which markets it wants to compete into.

4

competing in order to fulfill a specific congressional

5

mission, but rather to compete in order to break even to

6

make money.

7

It's not

Second, Congress has directed the Postal Service

8

enter these markets with scant regulatory oversight.

9

APA, the Postal Rate Commission, the Federal acquisition

10

regulations, all do not apply when the Postal Service is

11

acting under its non-monopoly powers.

12

The

QUESTION: You're saying then that the Cooper

13

decision doesn't affect your argument, because the - the

14

Congress has separated the Post Office Department from the

15

- from the executive?

16

MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.

And in

17

many other contexts, though, it's clear that this Court

18

has recognized that the Postal Service should be distinct

19

from the United States, the Franchise Tax opinion, the

20

Loeffler decision, and I think the other -

21
22
23

QUESTION: Well, neither of those are quite in
point.
MR. KRENT: Neither are involved in separate

24

cause of action, but both involve this Court's recognition

25

that the Postal Service is not the same as United States

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and should be treated differently.

2

QUESTION: But what do you do with the statutory

3

language that it's an establishment of the executive

4

branch of the Government of the United States?

5

MR. KRENT: Well, I think it is an establishment

6

of the executive branch, and it keeps some kind of

7

connection to the United States, and so, for instance,

8

Congress evidently cared about the fact that, given the

9

monopoly given over letter mail, that there would be some

10

tie.

11

appoint nor discharge the Postmaster General, but yet

12

there is some link between the President and the Postal

13

Service.

14

independent.

I mean, the - the President cannot, can neither

15
16

Yet financially, the Postal Service is

QUESTION: There isn't any Postmaster General
anymore, is there?

17

MR. KRENT: Well, there - there is, Your Honor,

18

in terms of the individual who's so-called under the

19

statute the executive official of the - of the United

20

States, and that individual is to - is also a member of

21

the Board of Governors of the Postal Service and is to

22

direct and execute the business operations of the Postal

23

Service.

24
25

QUESTION: How is he selected?

By the Board of

Governors?

1

MR. KRENT: Chosen by the Board of - yes, Your

2

Honor.

And I think that, again, Evans is the separation

3

or the insulation of the Postal Service from direct

4

executive branch control.

5

mentioned, the debts of the Postal Service are not the

6

debts of the United States.

7

against the Postal Service does not come from the judgment

8

fund, it comes from the Postal Service fund.

9

two things reflect the fact that the budget, as well as

But financially, as I

Any kind of - of recovery

Again, these

10

the overall financial structure of the Postal Service, is

11

independent.

12

And - and the fourth reason, Your Honor, of why

13

the Postal Service is a distinct entity is - is the fact

14

that there is a sue-and-be-sued clause that differentiates

15

this case from the Sea-Land case, in which there was no

16

sue-and-be-sued clause.

17
18
19

QUESTION: It doesn't differentiate though from
the Meyer case?
MR. KRENT: No, Your Honor, and indeed, we think

20

though that the - these four factors together amply

21

demonstrate that this is a - there is a congressional

22

intent that the Postal Service be considered a separate,

23

distinct entity that can qualify under the term, person,

24

in antitrust laws.

25

sue-and-be-sued clause.

And indeed, this is not an unadorned
Congress sat and thought about

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the ramifications of the sue-and-be-sued clause and

2

thought about what specific limitations should be grafted

3

on to the waiver of immunity.

4

Postal Service complied with the Federal Tort Claims Act.

5

It wanted to make sure that the Postal Service, despite

6

the distinction with the United States, viewed its own -

7

had different venue - had the same venue.

8

It decided to make sure the

QUESTION: But Meyer says you have to have

9

something more than a sue-and-be-sued clause, that you

10

have to show that there's a cause of action available.

11

a sue-and-be-sued clause itself is not enough for you in

12

this case, don't you agree with that?

13

MR. KRENT: I agree, Your Honor, and indeed it's

14

the fact that the antitrust laws say that every person

15

should be subject to the anti-competitive measures, or

16

pro-competitive measures, in - in the statutes.

17

QUESTION: Well, yes, but the - that was true -

18

they said that in the Cooper case too, that person, and

19

the Cooper Court said, no, the United States is not a

20

person.

21

So

MR. KRENT: That's right, Your Honor, but I think

22

the Cooper case must be looked at in the structure of the

23

decision itself, because the Cooper Court was very clear

24

to limit its decision.

25

United States because of the fact that there were other

2

and indeed, that that conformed to -

QUESTION: But certainly after the Cooper

decision, it was clear that the United States could not be

5

a defendant either, was it not, as well as not be a

6

plaintiff -

7
8
9
10

MR. KRENT: Well, it didn't matter Your Honor,
because there was no waiver of immunity.
QUESTION: Well, answer my question, will you?
MR. KRENT: I believe that it was clear, because

11

- but, again, I think that nobody tried to avail

12

themselves of that remedy because the United States had

13

not waived its immunity.

14

notion of the - of person, and to as broad as possible,

15

including states, including foreign governments, as well

16

as associations and public corporations.

17

But this Court extended the

QUESTION: Didn't the Court say in Cooper, the

18

reason why we're not letting the United States be a person

19

as plaintiff, because if we did that it would follow like

20

the night day that they would be a person as a defendant,

21

and we certainly don't want them to be a person as a

22

defendant?

So that's right in the -

23

QUESTION: That's right in the opinion.

25

something subtle.

One of the driving forces for saying

1

they couldn't be - they weren't going to read into the act

2

plaintiff status was that this Court thought that would

3

mean they would be a person for defendant status.

4

MR. KRENT: I agree that it's in the opinion,

5

Your Honor, but this Court, in Georgia v. Evans, and this

6

Court in Pfizer, made clear to cast the Cooper decision in

7

the light of the fact that it was a narrow decision,

8

predicated not specifically on that point, Your Honor, but

9

rather on the notion that there was an election of

10

remedies, the fact that the United States could sue to

11

seize property under the act, the United States could

12

pursue criminal penalties under the act, and that

13

linguistically, the United States doesn't seem to fit in

14

within the terms, an organization or association existing

15

under the law as the United States.

16

QUESTION: Well, the - what, the Postal

17

Reorganization Act was 1970?

18

suits been brought against the Postal Service in that 34

19

years?

20

Have any other antitrust

MR. KRENT: Not to my knowledge, Your Honor.

21

However, the Department of Justice in 1977 and again in

22

1978, made findings suggesting that the Postal Service was

23

likely to be subject to the antitrust laws.

24
25

QUESTION: That's no longer the position of the
department, is it?

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KRENT: That's correct.

It was soon after

2

the enactment of the 1970 statutes.

3

other entities, such as the Tennessee Valley Authority,

4

which has been found to be a person under the antitrust

5

acts, but I think it's - the fact that this is rising,

6

this question arises under the Postal Services is no

7

surprise, because the Postal Service has a roving mandate

8

to decide to go into the business of greeting cards in

9

competition to Hallmark, to go into the fact that it can

10

sell bicycling gear, to go into the market of the package

11

industry, to go into the market of calling cards and

12

compete against AT&T.

13

And indeed, there are

There is no other Federal entity to my knowledge

14

which has this kind of roving mandate to make money from

15

Congress, and indeed, it has used this ability -

23

I thought the statute had

MR. KRENT: Well, it has a statute - it - it's it's a rough balance.

It's unclear whether it's supposed

to make a little money or lose a little money.
QUESTION: But it - but it's unlike most profit-

24

making institutions that are primarily engaged in trying

25

to make as much money as they can.

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KRENT: That is correct, Your Honor, but in

2

the non-postal activities, the only objective is to make

3

money.

4

objectives limiting and channeling the actions of the

5

Postal Service, but with respect to selling bicycling gear

6

or selling greeting cards, the only objective the Postal

7

Service has is to make money, and it has tried to use this

8

power, and indeed, there were surpluses, as mentioned by

9

counsel for the Solicitor General, in several years.

Certainly for universal service there are other

So

10

the Postal Service can be successful at least at times,

11

but other times, of course, especially after 9/11, it has

12

seen hard times.

13

QUESTION: But even - even when it is, I take it

14

the object of the money that it makes is essentially to

15

break even, maybe break even and a little bit more, on -

16

on the mail delivery operation, which the statute itself

17

recites as being a sovereign responsibility of the United

18

States.

19

MR. KRENT: Well, I think that's -

20

QUESTION: So, I mean, that's - that's a long way

21
22

from General Motors.
MR. KRENT: I think it - it's - there is no

23

shareholders, for instance, looking for a profit, but the

24

goal of the Postal Service in these other areas of

25

business, whether it's the package business or the

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

greeting card business, is to make money.

2

QUESTION: Well, it is to make money, but it is

3

to make money in order to subsidize a particular activity,

4

and I don't think - maybe I'm missing something - but I

5

don't think there's an indication that there's a mandate

6

there to maximize profits to in - in effect subsidize the

7

rest of the Government.

8
9

MR. KRENT: Not - not the rest of the Government
at all, because there is a segregated fund.

But it is

10

there to - to make sure that any kind of losses that the

11

Postal Service may sustain in its monopoly business can be

12

overcome by profits generated in the non-monopoly

13

business.

14

QUESTION: And that monopoly business is

15

described in the statute as being the discharge of a

16

sovereign obligation of the United States, isn't it?

17

MR. KRENT: Absolutely.

The - the Congress has

18

been very clear that there is a monopoly business to be -

19

to be pursued here, and the Postal Service is pursuing

20

that.

But that's not what the Postal Service is only

21

about.

The Postal Service is also constructed as a

22

business, and that's what this Court has recognized in

23

Franchise Tax and in Loeffler case, and according to that

24

business principles, is pursuing other tasks as well.

25

It's not a

MR. KRENT: It's a corporation-like form, Your
Honor, and indeed QUESTION: Well, but it's not a separate
corporation.
MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.

I mean,

the Postal Service has described itself as a corporation.

10

QUESTION: Is it - is it a partnership?

11

MR. KRENT: It's - it's a board of directors-

12

type organization with the Board of Governors serving as a

13

type of Board of Governors - as a board of directors - and

14

the Board of Governors, as mentioned earlier, chooses the

15

head or the chief executive officer of, or the Postmaster

16

General, of the Postal Service itself.

unlike anything that one would find in - in a - in a

QUESTION: Well, why isn't this the kind of
policy judgment that we ought to leave to Congress to make

explicitly?

11

aspects to it, as you've pointed out effectively, but how

12

it should relate to the Antitrust Act seems to be the kind

13

of judgment that Congress should address expressly.

14

that so?

15

The Post Office, as reorganized, has two

Isn't

MR. KRENT: I think, Your Honor, that the

16

Congress has already made that judgment by suggesting that

17

the Postal Service have the right to be sue and be sued,

18

suggesting the Postal Service -

QUESTION: Well, I thought we had already

discussed that.

22

to answer the question.

I mean, the mere fact that there's a sue-

You have to -

MR. KRENT: Sure.

MR. KRENT: Right.

QUESTION:

- beyond that.

2

MR. KRENT: Sure, Your Honor.

The question is

3

whether or not the Postal Service fits within the term,

4

person.

5

person can be applied to public corporations, as this

6

Court has held.

7

states, as this Court has held.

8

be applied to foreign governmental entities, as this Court

9

has held.

We know under the antitrust laws, we know that

We know that person can be applied to
We know that person can

So the only question is whether this person can

10

also apply to Federal governmental entities, and we think

11

that it's clear that some, but very few, governmental

12

entities would qualify under the term, person.

13

QUESTION: But you - you - you concede that

14

before the Postal Reorganization Act, the answer to the

15

question would be no?

16

MR. KRENT: Absolutely.

17

QUESTION: So you - you have to - I mean, you're

18

- you're not writing on a blank slate.

19

find enough in the Postal Reorganization Act to change

20

that answer from no to yes, and that's really the burden.

You - you have to

21

MR. KRENT: I - I agree, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION: Given that the Postal Service was not

23

subject to the antitrust laws before, something so

24

fundamental happened in 1970 that it is now a person under

25

the antitrust law.

That's - that's your -

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KRENT: I fully agree with that.

2

QUESTION:

3

- your burden.

MR. KRENT: I full agree with that, and I think we can

4

discharge that burden if you look at the fact that the

5

Postal Service is financially independent, it's

6

administratively independent, it doesn't have to comply

7

with the pro-competitive measures and the Federal

8

acquisitions regulations, it has a sue-and-be-sued clause.

9
10

QUESTION: But its employees, are its employees

11

subject to the Taft-Hartley law, or - or - or are they

12

like - like Federal workers?

13

MR. KRENT: They are the only employees in the

14

entire government to my knowledge that must comply with

15

the Taft-Hartley law, and indeed, Congress specified that

16

it must comply within the law, because it wanted them to

17

act more like a business and not have this restrictures of

18

other organizations within the United States as they -

19

following the fellow labor relations authority, Your

20

Honor.

21

QUESTION: So - so - would - would their

22

employees be members of the American Federation of

23

Governmental Employees or other unions?

24
25

MR. KRENT: I believe it's the American Postal
Workers Union, Your Honor.

QUESTION: Postal workers union?

2

MR. KRENT: Yes.

So it's a - it's a separate -

3

they're separated again from the Government with respect

4

to labor relations.

governmental entities that have signified their own

6

operations under www-dot - dot-com.

decided not to become a governmental player.

14

And indeed, they are one of the few

All right, they have

QUESTION: But of course, the Reorganization Act
itself specified that they'd be subject to Taft-Hartley,
did it not?
MR. KRENT: That's correct.

And that's part and

parcel, I think QUESTION: So why didn't it specify that they
would be subject to the Sherman Act?

15

MR. KRENT: Because -

16

QUESTION: You see, I - I don't think that helps

17

you, I think it hurts you.

18

MR. KRENT: I don't -

19

QUESTION: It - it is a significant feature that

20

- that the - their employees are subject to Taft-Hartley,

21

but that - that is more than answered by the fact that it

22

says so in the Reorganization Act.

23

about the - about the antitrust laws?

24
25

Why doesn't it say so

MR. KRENT: Well, I think it's important to think
about what the Postal Reorganization Act does say.

When

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it waives immunity, it makes limitations.

2

are that the Postal Service must comply with the

3

limitations in the Federal Tort Claims Act, that it has a

4

different - the same venue provisions as by the United

5

States, and that it has some of the jurisdictional

6

qualities as the United States, though the - so the

7

limitations and ramifications of the waiver are grafted in

8

section 409 very clearly.

9

and I think it's important to realize -

10

The limitations

There is no other limitation,

QUESTION: Yeah, but there's one - one sticking

11

point that - running through my mind.

12

had to waive the immunity in the sue-and-be-sued clause

suggest that they're a sovereign.

The fact that they

17

the Government.

There's never been any kind of

QUESTION: And is a sovereign.

19

MR. KRENT: And - yes, Your Honor.

And it takes

20

- takes part of the - in the - in the sense that it would

21

have immunity, but for the waiver, clearly because

22

Congress created the entity, and therefore Congress

23

decides whether to waive the immunity.

24
25

QUESTION: Of course, if you're right, they're
subject to criminal liability under the Sherman Act too.

MR. KRENT: Well, so are states theoretically, as

2

well as cities.

3

that is at least a theoretical possibility and this Court

4

has averted to that in prior decisions as well.

5

thing is true, of course, for cities under -

I don't think that would ever arise, but

The same

QUESTION: A criminal case with the United States
against the United States Postal Service.

8

MR. KRENT: Well, I don't think that's likely to

9

happen, Your Honor, but I think it's important that this -

10

this waiver allows the Postal Service also to vindicate

11

its own interests, right.

12

Service could not go in and sue for any kind of antitrust

13

injuries, and that's not clear.

14

But for this waiver, Postal

QUESTION: But Congress could have said the

15

Postal Service is authorized to sue and omitted the be-

16

sued clause.

It could have done it that way -

17

MR. KRENT: That -

18

QUESTION: - in which there would have been no

19
20

waiver.
MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.

That

21

would have made this case go away.

22

to follow that path, and indeed, if one could think that

1

QUESTION: Well, to say launch into the

2

commercial marketplace, they're basically selling stamps

3

and nobody else is selling stamps.

4

launching is that?

5

What kind of a

MR. KRENT: Well, I think it's now for the

6

monopoly business, Your Honor, but the launching with -

7

with respect to the package delivery business, the

8

greeting card business, the fact that they are sponsoring

9

Lance Armstrong's bicycling team, these are all the areas

10

in which the Postal Service has decided to venture outside

11

of its mandate, and it's - the danger is allowing the

12

Postal Service to extend its monopoly power into these new

13

fields.

14

QUESTION: Mr. Krent -

QUESTION: But when it goes into all those fields

16

anyway - we've made this point about 15 times - it - it

doesn't set the prices it wants.

supposed to break even.

It sets prices

forth?

MR. KRENT: No jurisdiction.

The Postal Service

QUESTION: So is it - it - and it's free?

In

5

other words, it doesn't - it isn't - well, you - I thought

6

you answered Justice Souter by saying that they do have an

7

obligation even there to break even overall?

8
9

MR. KRENT: Oh, overall, Your Honor, but the
Postal Rate Commission has no jurisdiction whatsoever on

10

the Postal Service's actions with respect to greeting

11

cards, bicycling gear, and the package delivery business.

12

And I think that points out the danger of the monopoly

13

practices.

14

One could easily see -

QUESTION: So if in - in the greeting card

15

business, they decided to go into an agreement with three

16

other companies, Hallmark and Smith's greeting cards, and

17

they were to fix their prices at $14 a greeting card,

18

which seems about right nowadays -

19

(Laughter.)

20

QUESTION:

21

- the - the - then under those

circumstances, there would be no remedy -

22

MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.

23

QUESTION: - for the consumer of the stores.

24

There's no government agency anybody could appeal to?

25

MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor.

1

QUESTION: All right.

So that's -

2

MR. KRENT: Absolutely none.

And indeed, if

3

there was a tying arrangement of trying to say, if you

4

want our postal services then you have to buy our greeting

5

cards, to follow your example, no remedy whatsoever there

6

as well, so that all these kinds of fear of predatory

7

pricing, tying arrangements, monopolistic prices, the -

8

there's a danger -

9

QUESTION: Well, but there - there wouldn't be a

10

remedying as the Postal Service, but I assume you could

11

sue American Greetings and Hallmark and whoever else had

12

conspired with the Postal Service.

13

MR. KRENT: You might, unless it was a tying

14

agreement, Your Honor.

15

unilateral action of the Postal Service with a tying

16

arrangement, there would be no remedy.

If it was unilateral action, they'd

MR. KRENT: You never know.

QUESTION: It might happen, I suppose.

23

QUESTION: Mr. Krent, can we go back to Sea-

One never knows.

24

Land, where I thought that the first point made in that

25

decision was indeed as a result of the change in the APA

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that Alaska Railroad could be sued for injunctive relief.

2

The Court said, yeah, they could be sued like any person,

3

not for damages, but for injunctive relief.

4

said, but this is the question of whether Congress

5

authorized them to be a defendant in an antitrust case is

6

a totally discrete question, it has nothing to do with the

7

waiver of sovereign immunity.

8

And then it

MR. KRENT: Well, indeed, that - that's right,

9

Your Honor, and indeed, the difference in - in Sea-Land is

10

the fact that the Alaska Airlines never had a - never had

11

to argue that they were separate from the United States.

12

Their argument was that the United States could be sued

13

for its proprietary activities under the Sherman Act.

14

They didn't argue that they were a distinct entity, so

15

they never said that - there was no - they agreed that

16

there was no sue-and-be-sued clause, and so that whole

17

argument that we're making in this case was never even

18

raised in Sea-Land.

19

QUESTION: Well, I'm - from the Court's point of

20

view, it - the Court made as a threshold determination

21

that the railroad could be sued for equitable relief, so

22

it could be sued.

23

answer the question, we have to determine whether there is

24

a claim, any claim under the antitrust laws, and on that

25

the Court relied on Cooper.

And then it says, but that doesn't

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KRENT: That's correct, Your Honor, because

2

of the Court's holding that the Alaska Airlines did not

3

qualify under the term person under the antitrust laws.

4

And it's our contention, because the Postal Service is not

5

structured anywhere like the Alaska Airlines, because it's

6

- Alaska Airlines did not have a separate budget, the

7

Alaska Airlines could not sue and be sued, the Alaska

8

airlines had to comply with the APA, unlike the Postal

9

Service, that the Postal Service is a person, whereas the

10

Alaska Airlines and the SBA and the Department of Commerce

11

and HUD would not be persons under the antitrust law.

12

it's a very narrow argument predicated on the structure -

So

MR. KRENT: Well, I've never seen their license
plates, your Honor, but I'm QUESTION: But, I mean, and - and they say that

they're part of the Government, and 80 or 90 percent of

8

what they do is not what private industry does at all and

9

you have remedies against all of it except - under other

statutes or powers of review within the Government, except

11

for a small portion, I take it it is a small portion, this

to sell them burlap sacks.

mentioned -

MR. KRENT: I think that what - actually that

that there was a conspiracy to monopolize the mail sack

commissions that run them and tell them they can't do it?

4

MR. KRENT: Well, there - there is a procurement

would not have jurisdiction over the - the mail sack

that these kind of - of trade practices that are anti-

Certainly there is an overlap between

think that the Government has conceded, that the Postal

Clearly it has to apply to

There was some point in waiving the immunity

MR. KRENT: But the waiver was for torts and then

the Federal Tort Claims Act must be applied, but clearly

48
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there's a waiver -

3

QUESTION: Even though it's a state court action
against the Post Office?

4

MR. KRENT: That's correct, just as it would be

5

in any - for other Federal entity, but, for instance, the

6

7
8
9

QUESTION: So the - the Post Office can be sued
in state court then for a - for a state tort?
MR. KRENT: Well, it could be, except for the

10

fact that the - the limitations of the Federal Tort Claims

11

Act apply by virtue of 409.

12
13

QUESTION: Well, that's - that what I thought I
asked you a minute ago -

14

MR. KRENT: Well then -

15

QUESTION: - and you said something different.

16

MR. KRENT: Well, I'm sorry if I misunderstood

17

your question, Your Honor, but the - the argument then is

18

that - that in other kinds of cases, such as the state law

19

that said person in the Franchise Task - Tax - whether

20

that - the question is whether that applies to the Postal

21

Service as well, and of course in this Court, upheld the

22

determination that the Postal Service would comply under

23

the term person under the state law as well.

24
25

So how far does person apply?

Contract law,

tort law, what about the Lanham Act, the trademark case?

49
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Before the recent amendments to the Lanham Act that were

2

mentioned recently, the - all the statute said was that it

3

was applied to persons, and three courts of appeals

4

suggested that even though person could not apply to the

5

United States, person could apply to the Postal Service,

6

by virtue of its distinct status.

7

QUESTION: But I thought the Lanham Act,

8

definition written right into the Lanham Act was that a

9

person within the meaning of that act is an organization

10

capable of suing and being sued.MR. KRENT: Yes, but courts

11

had said that the United States, previous to that, did not

12

fall within the term person, because the person doesn't

13

refer to governmental entities at all. So there the courts

14

had distinguished -

15

QUESTION: It said it with respect to the

16

antitrust law in Cooper, but the Lanham Act defined person

17

differently.

18

MR. KRENT: But just slightly, Your Honor.

The

19

only difference was the capable-of-being-sued part.

The

20

United States is also capable of being sued.

21

QUESTION: But I - I thought that was what was

22

critical, that any organization capable of suing and being

23

sued was within the Lanham Act.

24

MR. KRENT: But the United States, Your Honor,

25

can also be sued and is capable of suing itself, so I'm

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not sure that that distinguishes it, and indeed, under

2

that language, courts had held the United States was not

3

liable, and yet the Postal Service had registered

4

trademarks in its own name, the Postal Service had

5

registered copyrights in its own name, even though the

6

United States cannot hold copyrights, and there is an

7

exception -

8
9

QUESTION: But isn't there a good reason for
that?

10

MR. KRENT: Well, I think there is a good reason.

11

QUESTION: To stop people from engaging in

12
13

designed piracy in stamps?
MR. KRENT: And indeed, if that were all that the

14

Postal Service had filed for, I would be - I would be in

15

total agreement with Your Honor.

16

had filed for 300, at least 350, I believe, copyrights,

17

books, training manuals, things that have nothing to do

18

with the protection for the legitimacy of - of stamps.

But the Postal Service

19

So again, the Postal Office has defined itself

20

through its actions as a person in comparable commercial

21

tort situations.

22

Service in the commercial world, saying that it's not like

23

the United States for copyrights, for trademarks, then

24

it's not like United States with respect to antitrust.

25

It's only logical that if a Postal

When Congress formed the Postal Service, Your

Honors, and it took away the APA, the Postal Rate

2

Commission for these non-monopoly actions, as well as the

3

Federal acquisition regulations, certainly there was a

4

quid pro quo.

5

If you streamline the operations of the Postal

6

Service, launch it into business, you would expect the

7

private commercial torts in antitrust laws to be the

8

restraint to make sure that the monopoly is not extended

9

to the other kind of operations.

And so I think that

10

Congress' intent is quite clear that the Postal Service is

11

unique, does not partake of the United States, and

12

therefore, just as the Postal Service can be sued in tort

13

law and under the Lanham Act, be it the old Lanham Act,

14

the new Lanham Act, it can be sued under the antitrust

15

laws as well.

16

The burden, therefore, on the Solicitor General

17

to explain why Congress would have wanted the Postal

18

Service's monopoly to be extended, and why Congress would

19

have wanted the Postal Service to be sue - to be able to

20

be sued and to sue themselves without really being able to

21

take advantage of the opportunity to sue in their own name

22

under the antitrust laws or under trademark and copyright

23

law, et cetera, and why they shouldn't be sued as well.

24

If there are no further questions, thank you.

QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. Krent.

Mr. Kneedler, you have six minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. KNEEDLER: Several points, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

In addition to the other statutes that I've mentioned with

6

respect to the right to sue, there are a number of other

7

respects in which Congress has treated the Postal Service

8

as a Federal entity.

9

Information Act, the Privacy Act, the Inspector General

It's subject to their Freedom of

10

Act, it's subject to the Federal sector OSHA regulations,

11

and as this Court pointed out in the Loeffler decision,

12

it's subject to the Federal sector Title VII prohibitions,

13

not - it's not treated as a private corporation for

14

purposes of Title VII.

15

It is subject to the National Labor Relations

16

Act, but this act was passed in 1970 before the Federal

17

sector labor - labor management provisions came in in the

18

Civil Service Reform Act, and as you pointed out, Justice

19

Scalia, that's an express provision subjecting the Postal

20

Service to something that otherwise applies to private

21

entities, but in - but in virtually every other respect,

22

Congress has specified that it would be subject to Federal

23

law.

24

And in section 409 of the act, with respect to

25

judicial proceedings, Congress specified that the Postal

53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Service would be - would be treated just like the United

2

States, not just with respect to Tort Claims Act, but

3

venue, removal jurisdiction, and representation by the

4

Attorney General.

5

But the - the most fundamental point, however,

6

to be made is that this is not a situation in which

7

Congress has created a new entity and launched, in that

8

sense, that entity into a private commercial world.

9

Congress has carried forward the nation's tradition of

Here,

10

treating postal services as sovereign functions performed

11

by the Government of the United States.

12

are - to the extent they're commercial functions and - and

13

they are unusual commercial functions, the Constitution

14

treats them as - as something of particular interest to

15

the United States Government.

16

These are - these

I should point out that with respect to the

17

postal services, all postal services are subject to the

18

jurisdiction of the Postal Rate Commission, not just those

19

that are subject to monopoly, that - that the Postal

20

Service has monopoly control over, Justice Breyer.

21

even in those areas in which the Postal Service is subject

22

to competition in - in parcel and express mail, for

23

example, the Postal Service - the Postal Rate Commission -

24

does have regulatory jurisdiction over those -

25

QUESTION: So greeting cards?

So

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. KNEEDLER: It does not over greeting cards,

2

but the non-postal functions of the Postal Service

3

constitute less than 1 percent of the revenues of the - of

4

the Postal Service.

5

aspect of the Postal Service's operations, and the

6

affirmative authorization for the Postal Service to engage

7

in that in section 404(7) of the act is cast in the same

8

terms as the Postal Service's authorization to engage in

9

all the other functions and they're really incidental.

10

We're talking about a very minor

QUESTION: But the fact that it's only - the fact

11

that it's only 1 percent means they're only liable under

12

the antitrust laws for 1 percent of their business.

13

MR. KNEEDLER: No, I think - I think it shows

14

that - that - that the predominant character of the Postal

15

Service is as it always has been, and these - these other

16

services are really in most ways incidental to - to postal

17

services like greeting cards and - and that sort of thing.

18
19

QUESTION: But they're the services that they
want to bring suits under.

20

That's -

MR. KNEEDLER: This - this is - this is not -

21

this is not that.

22

procurement dispute that - all Federal agencies engage in

23

procurement and - and -

24
25

This case is a - is an ordinary

QUESTION: That's the curious thing about this
suit.

It actually represents a portion of the monopoly

55
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

business, of using the monopoly to - to monopolize

2

procurement.

3

MR. KNEEDLER: And in procurement, and in

4

procurement in particular, Congress has treated the Postal

5

Service like all other - all other Federal agencies under

6

the Contract Disputes Act, particularly with respect to

7

the disputes at issue here.

8

that, as Justice O'Connor said, this is essentially a

9

policy choice for Congress.

So in the end we believe

If - if in the current

10

climate the Postal Service is to be subject to the

11

antitrust laws, notwithstanding the fact that it remains a

12

governmental entity, that is a - that is a choice that

13

Congress should make, whether these governmental

14

activities should be regulated by treble damage actions,

15

which was extremely unusual under - under Federal

16

statutes.

17

And where Congress has chosen to subject the

18

United States to liability under statutes such as this,

19

but not nearly as free-ranging in the patent laws, et

20

cetera, it has done so expressly, and we think 30 years

21

after the passage of the Postal Reorganization Act, that

22

if the - if the Postal Service is now to be subject to the

23

antitrust laws, that is something for Congress to do and

24

not for the courts to try to divine from complete silence

25

in the Postal Reorganization Act or its legislative

history on that point.

2

If there are no further questions.

3

QUESTION: Do they really sell biking gear?

4

don't sell biking gear.

5

They

Do they sell biking gear?

MR. KNEEDLER: I - I'm not sure whether they - I

6

- I don't know whether they sell biking gear.

7

that they - the fact that they use the Postal Service team

8

in - in - in promoting Postal Service products, I think,

9

doesn't say anything about whether they're subject -

10
11

The fact

QUESTION: They might deliver some mail on
bicycles, I mean -

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. KNEEDLER: It's entirely possible.
