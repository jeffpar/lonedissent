CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in No. 03-6821, David Nelson v. Donal Campbell.
Mr. Stevenson.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRYAN STEVENSON
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STEVENSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
6 days before petitioner's scheduled execution

11

in this case, an execution that he had sought and

12

informally requested be -- be carried out as soon as

13

possible, prison officials went to him and for the first

14

time told him that to deal with a medical problem that

15

both parties acknowledged exists, he would be subjected to

16

a procedure that would be conducted by State officials,

17

not necessarily medically trained, not necessarily

18

licensed, where they were going to make a 2-inch incision

19

in his arm, cut through fat and tissue and muscle, until

20

they had a vein that they could access for the purposes of

21

inserting a catheter.

22

QUESTION:

Well, presumably at a much earlier

23

date, the prisoner did know that he -- he was -- he would

24

be scheduled to be executed by lethal injection.

25

MR. STEVENSON:

Absolutely, Your -- Your Honor.

Absolutely, and as soon as he -足

So -- so presumably in -- well in

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes, Your Honor, and he did.

immediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison.

He was housed in another facility some 200 miles away.

9

immediately began contacting the warden at Holman Prison,

He

10

who had just been installed, who did not know him, and

11

informed him he had this condition, that they would need

12

to create protocols necessary to deal with it.

13

The State admitted that they had never dealt

14

with someone in this condition before and began offering

15

all kinds of things that would accomplish this execution.

16

Let him bring in a physician that can insert a catheter.

17

Let's get some protocols established so that we don't have

18

any problems.

And for 6 weeks essentially this effort was

20

He had been previously told that they were going

21

to do this 24 hours in advance, that they weren't going to

22

make this kind of 2-inch incision, and even though he

23

hadn't been assured there would be medical people, he was

24

relatively comfortable with that.

It's only 6 days before for the first time that the State

announced they would have this kind of invasive procedure

2

carried out by someone who was not necessarily medically

3

trained.

4

He filed a 1983 action.

I think it's important

5

for this Court's judgment here today.

The district court

6

found that that 1983 action, if it went in Mr. Nelson's

7

favor, would not invalidate his judgment or conviction.

8

Notwithstanding that conclusion, the district court felt

9

compelled to apply a rule in force in the Eleventh Circuit

10

that effectively shields death row prisoners facing an

11

execution from doing anything that can challenge

12

unconstitutional conditions of -- of confinement.

13

The Eleventh Circuit rule is essentially once

14

you are scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter that

15

the prison begins to do something and amount to something

16

that -- that is unconstitutional.

17

QUESTION:

Well, they're -- they're not saying

18

that.

19

unconstitutional conditions of confinement.

20

kept in a dank and dark cell that's -- that's cruel and

21

painful.

22

-- is an action that, in effect, says I can't be executed

23

the way the State intends to execute me, that that has to

24

have been brought up earlier.

25

They can bring actions that -- that challenge
He's being

The only thing they're saying he can't bring is

MR. STEVENSON:

Yes, and -- and I -- I guess

QUESTION:

It has -- has to be under habeas

rather than under 1983.

Well, but it's unlike these other

11

actions in this one crucial respect:

12

prevent the execution.

MR. STEVENSON:

No.

14

to facilitate the execution.

saying, let's just get an order so that my doctor can come

sense.

Mr. Nelson's counsel was

And the Eleventh Circuit judgment, Justice

23

Scalia, is actually one that says once the petitioner is

24

scheduled for an execution, it doesn't matter whether it's

25

a conditions of confinement suit as you described, that

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Federal courts somehow have no authority to grant

2

relief or conduct review because the execution -- the

3

scheduling of the execution somehow divests those courts

4

of jurisdiction.

5

That's the Eleventh Circuit rule.

They didn't argue here that because his

6

litigation, because his lawsuit is, in effect, an attempt

7

to bar the execution, he loses.

8
9

That's the distinction.

What they said here is that because he is
already scheduled for execution, it doesn't matter what

10

the conditions of the confinement are, whether it

11

invalidates the conviction and sentence.

12

have no authority to grant relief.

13

urge this Court to overturn.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. STEVENSON:

16

QUESTION:

Federal courts

And that's the rule we

May -- may I get clear on one thing?
Yes, sir.

Did he -- did his counsel say to the

17

court, the district court, we want under 1983 an order

18

that says admit this man's doctor to the place of

19

execution at the time the State chooses so he can find a

20

way then and there to allow the State to carry out the

21

execution when it wants to do it?

22

MR. STEVENSON:

Did he ask for that?

Well, what he asked for -- what

23

-- what he -- what he put in his complaint was that he had

24

made that offer to the State, and that was in his

25

complaint, that -- that the defendant's counsel had

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

authorized or requested the opportunity to bring in a

2

physician to facilitate a review -足

3

QUESTION:

4

he went into court?

5

Is that what he was asking for when

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, what he was asking for is

6

an injunction barring them from doing this kind of 2-inch

7

incision, but yes, he made it very clear in the

8

complaint -足

9

QUESTION:

Was it made clear to the district

10

court that he would be satisfied with the order I have

11

just described?

12

MR. STEVENSON:

Only to the extent -- yes, I

13

believe so, Your Honor, because when the district court

14

said, can't you work this out, Mr. Nelson's counsel said,

15

yes, I think we can.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Did -- did he ask for a postponement

of the execution?
MR. STEVENSON:

He did, Your Honor.

He did, and

19

that was in part because the State was, at least at the

20

point at which this lawsuit was filed in, saying that this

21

is what they were going to do in -- in the absence of some

22

kind of Federal intervention.

23

QUESTION:

24
25

What would have been the terms of the

postponement that you were asking for?
MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I think the district court

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

could have basically issued a cease and desist order.

2

are enjoined from doing this kind of conduct because it

3

violates contemporary standards of medical decency.

4

QUESTION:

Would it have been sufficient to say,

5

don't -- postpone it until you admit the doctor to be

6

present and get the catheter in?

7

You

MR. STEVENSON:

I -- I think it could have been

8

sufficient to say I'm going to order that his physician be

9

admitted into the facility.

I'm going to order that you

10

accomplish this through the method proposed by

11

petitioner's counsel.

12

have been done, but the district court here felt like he

13

did not have the authority to actually deal with this in

14

the 1983 context.

15

QUESTION:

I think all of those things could

Was it that -- before, Mr. Stevenson,

16

you said that nothing that the prisoner requests, once the

17

date of execution is set, is actionable in 1983.

18

thought that the Eleventh Circuit made a distinction

19

between a proceeding that would require a stay of the

20

execution.

21

-- in a dark, dank cell, that would be actionable so long

22

as he's not seeking to postpone the date of the execution,

23

as I understand it.

But I

It's what they're going to do.
MR. STEVENSON:

Well, yes, that's -- he was told

for the first time on that Friday, 2-inch incision in the

17

arm, not necessarily done by someone medically trained.

18

That presented a very different kind of -足

QUESTION:

something special had to be done with respect to him

21

because he had these compromised veins.

MR. STEVENSON:

Absolutely.

Didn't he?

And -- and the

23

record reflects that there were repeated efforts on the

24

part of Mr. Nelson's counsel to get the State to -- to

25

deal with it.

QUESTION:

MR. STEVENSON:

In 1978.

1983?

19

MR. STEVENSON:

Or do we take this case on

Well, no, it was not styled as a

20

habeas action, in part because the Eleventh Circuit rules

21

would have prevented us from ever getting review in this

22

Court or any other court if it had been framed in that

23

way.

Is that -- is that correct?

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, yes.

It's not

There -- there

6

Justice Kennedy, apply this Court's doctrine in Stewart v.

Martinez where a claim, an execution claim, not previously

ripe, can be subject to habeas review.

The Eleventh

is that if it wasn't in your first habeas, it can't be

QUESTION:

Well, what does the statute say?

It

says it has to be not only not previously ripe -- you

didn't have the information -- but also the statute says

it has to show that he was innocent.

MR. STEVENSON:

QUESTION:

We do not.

Because ripeness could be a merely

In the Eleventh Circuit

Absolutely.

-- at the time.

So this is more than

just ripeness.
MR. STEVENSON:

Absolutely.

And -- and, Justice

15

Souter, I think you're absolutely right.

16

you're not trying to do something that invalidates a

17

conviction and sentence, it's not arguably appropriate to

18

be thinking about this in the habeas context.

19

Here, where

2241(c) says that to grant habeas relief, the

20

petitioner has to allege that the conviction and sentence

21

is illegal, is in violation of the Constitution.

22

not Mr. Nelson's contention here.

23

QUESTION:

That's

Would you say -- would you be making

24

the same argument if his complaint was not this inch cut

but the combination of chemicals?

MR. STEVENSON:

No, Your Honor.

I think that's

2

a much -- a much harder question because that does, it

3

seems to me, get closer to the execution.

4

analogous to our claim is a claim where the prison says a

5

week before the execution that we're going to and

6

effectively shackle you to a hitching post and not give

7

you any food for 72 hours.

treatment would be in violation of the Constitution.

we'd be trying to block is that treatment, not the

10

MR. STEVENSON:

What -- what is the

I think the primary difference,

Justice Scalia, is that those are a method of execution

cases.

executions.

MR. STEVENSON:

QUESTION:

Well, I guess -足

-- categories of case.

MR. STEVENSON:

It's not clear, Your Honor, that

in all of those cases that they are saying if you want to

12

use a different drug, that's okay.

13

one distinction.

14

I think that that's

I think the second distinction is that an order

15

-- particularly in States that have statutes dictating

16

which chemicals can be used, in those cases it may be

17

easier for a court to find that an order in that case does

18

invalidate the sentence.

19

Here we have a completely severable procedure.

20

We have something that is not in any way required by the

21

execution.

22

it this way, and there are 100 other ways that it can be

23

done.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KEVIN C. NEWSOM

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

6
7

MR. NEWSOM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

8

I'd like to make three points this morning.

9

I'd like to first discuss and to convince the

10

Court that a challenge to a State's means of gaining

11

venous access for purposes of accomplishing a lethal

12

injection, a challenge that runs to the very core of the

13

execution process, is indeed tantamount to a challenge of

14

the imposition of the sentence itself and subject to

15

habeas corpus restrictions.

16

I hope also to -- to be able to address the

17

remedies issue, which we were discussing with Mr.

18

Stevenson at the end of -- of his argument.

19

And third, I'd like to discuss the practical

20

consequences of a decision in Nelson's favor in this case,

21

which I think will be not only to unleash in Federal

22

courts a torrent of -- of new challenges to all manner of

23

State execution procedures, but also in the process,

24

fundamentally to undermine Congress' intent to stem the

25

tide of what President Clinton in his signing statement

called endless death row appeals.

On the -- on your first point, are

you going to address directly whether this is second or

4

successive?

MR. NEWSOM:

Our

position, of course, is that this -- that this sort of

answer to Justice Souter's question, I think that there is

25

a concession on the record.

Of course, this -- this

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

the lower courts.

It was raised for the first time in -足

QUESTION:

Well, it wasn't raised because he

4

But, I mean, as I understand the -- the

5

application of the Alabama rule, 1983 was ruled out

6

because this either should have been brought in habeas or

7

if it had been brought in habeas, it would have been

8

barred under AEDPA, and it would have been barred under

9

AEDPA, because it was second or successive.

So I think

10

regardless of -- of how we analyze it, we've got to get to

11

that point.

MR. NEWSOM:

And our position certainly is, Your

13

Honor, that this would have been barred as second or

successive.

15

the head.

16

has not done business, I think, with the textual and

17

structural gymnastics required to -- to make this petition

18

anything other than second or successive.

19

in essence, is that any claim that is new, in the sense

20

that it could not have been brought before, is by

21

definition not second or successive.

22

I think Justice Scalia really hit the nail on

It is -- Mr. Stevenson, in his argument, just

QUESTION:

His position,

Well, isn't that a possibility?

In

23

other words, one of the things we've got to do is -- is

24

give effect to the -- to the AEDPA text.

25

effect to the -- I'm not saying that we should read it

We can give

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this way, but we could give effect to the AEDPA text if we

2

say that regardless of whether a claim was ripe or not as

3

a factual matter, so long as there is new evidence,

4

whatever new means, the evidence is -- is not going to

5

entitle him to relief unless it satisfies the -- the

6

innocence prong at the end of the test.

7

and at the same time say, all right, that's how we give

8

effect to AEDPA.

9

We could say that

But if there is something more than ripeness,

10

which makes the difference between bringing the claim and

11

not bringing the claim, then that goes to whether we

12

should regard it as second or successive.

13

something more here because this is a claim which simply

14

did not arise.

15

any point prior to the conclusion of -- of his habeas, and

16

for that reason, we should interpret second or successive

17

as not barring this because otherwise we would have a

18

universe of claims, assuming they are proper habeas

19

claims, that could never be brought even though they state

20

a constitutional claim.

But that's -- that's fine, but I

2

mean, that's a conclusory statement:

3

What I'm suggesting to you is that this is a good reason

4

to say that the term, second or successive, does have some

5

limiting effect.

6

MR. NEWSOM:

for whatever reason.

Perhaps, but I think that we are

7

coming awfully close simply to -- to reading the

8

limitations that Congress imposed on these sorts of

9

petitions out of the statute.

10

11

simply wouldn't have added the second condition.

that it does allude to a body of law by which we made -足

would say, on August 19th of 2003, when the record at

6

QUESTION:

Well now, if there is no remedy in

7

the Federal district court, why should there not be a 1983

8

remedy?

9

MR. NEWSOM:

Well, because our -- our position,

10

Your Honor, is that 1983 is not intended to be used to

11

fill the gaps in the remedial scheme that Congress has

12

specifically set up in the habeas statutes, that instead

13

section 1983 deals with different kinds of claims.

14

QUESTION:

Do you think AEDPA amended 1983?

15

MR. NEWSOM:

No.

But the point is, of course,

16

statutory sources of review.

QUESTION:

In answer -足

And indeed, the reason there's no

normal rules to prevent abuse of process.

25

MR. NEWSOM:

Let me try to answer these various

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

questions in order, if I can keep up.
With respect to your first question, I think

3

that to be sure, there is -- the -- the district court can

4

always reject the claim, but the problem is that when

5

these claims come in at the last minute and the complaint

6

is chock full of -- of inflammatory language, then the

7

district courts I think in -- in many cases will feel

8

virtually coerced into granting the stay.

9

itself is -- is an imposition or an impediment to the

10
11

And the stay

State's imposition of the sentence.
QUESTION:

But there's nothing in the language.

12

I mean, as I read the language of 1983, it says there will

13

be an action, if I'm subject to the deprivation of a right

14

secured by the Constitution, which is what his claim is.

15

So it fits within the language.

16

MR. NEWSOM:

17

QUESTION:

To be sure.

And there's nothing in the habeas

18

statute that suggests it fits because habeas is when

19

you're challenging a custody in violation of the

20

Constitution.

21

1983 does apply.

22

So the habeas language doesn't apply and

And there's nothing in Preiser that suggests it

23

fits because that's where in fact we're talking about a

24

challenge to fact or duration, and he's not challenging

25

the fact and he's not challenging the duration.

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And there's nothing in Heck v. Humphrey because

2

it talks about necessarily implying the invalidity of the

3

conviction or sentence, and he's not talking about the

4

conviction and he's not talking about the sentence that

5

was given in the judgment anyway.

6

All right.

So how is it we get this claim which

7

risks people who might have a valid claim not getting into

8

court -足

9

MR. NEWSOM:

10
11

QUESTION:

Okay.

Now -足

-- into the language of any prior

case or the statute itself?

12

MR. NEWSOM:

Bear with me.

Section 1983, to be

13

sure, does not exclude this claim as a matter of its text,

14

but this Court in Preiser did make clear that -- that

15

where a -- where an action falls within the traditional

16

scope of habeas corpus, that section 1983 must give way.

17

When there is that intersection, section 1983 must give

18

way.

19

Now, in answer to part two of the question, to

20

be sure, the habeas corpus -- the -- the specific language

21

of the habeas corpus statute talks in terms of custody,

22

but for more than 100 years, this Court has dealt with

challenges to death sentences in habeas corpus petitions.

I'll ask Mr. Stevenson to clarify

MR. NEWSOM:

11

Gomez is in some sense more -- more egregious than the

abuse here.

13

answer -- in answer to Justice Breyer's question was that

14

this Court in Lonchar pointed to Gomez for the proposition

15

that habeas rules apply to method of execution claims

without respect to what label is placed at the top of the

correct, Justice Scalia, that this Court has held that

promise you that I know precisely where that line is

between the outer bounds of an execution procedures claim

of injection does not challenge the legality of injection.
MR. NEWSOM:

It just strikes me, Justice Souter,

that that with respect -- well, let me answer in two ways.

4

First, as I said earlier, I think the record in

5

this case is clear that the cut-down becomes a live issue

6

only in -- in the event that it is necessary.

7

Point two, and I think the more important point,

8

is that it just strikes me as a bad way to administer the

9

rule on a going-forward basis for a district court to have

10

to sift through on a procedure-by-procedure basis to

11

determine is this procedure in fact medically,

12

scientifically necessary to accomplish the sentence, in

13

which case Mr. Stevenson I think concedes that it's a

14

habeas petition, but it's not.

15

QUESTION:

What you're doing is asking all the

16

courts, including this one, to ignore the very issue and

17

simply say, in effect, under AEDPA we don't care.

18

we're somewhere between the devil and the deep blue sea

19

here, and -- and I would suppose there -- there ought to

20

be a middle ground.

21

MR. NEWSOM:

I mean,

I certainly am not suggesting in

22

any -- to any extent that -- and I don't think it's true

23

-- that -- that to extent that, say, a -- a technically

24

unnecessary but nonetheless chosen procedure for gaining

venous access is unreviewable.

MR. NEWSOM:

9

MR. NEWSOM:

Your -- that's right, Your Honor,

and this will give me I think a -- as good an opportunity

10

as I can to try to sum up our position in this case.

11

We have certainly made the argument that a

12

challenge to a State's means of gaining venous access, a

13

challenge to -- to a procedure for carrying out an

14

execution is in and of itself -- should be understood to

15

be a challenge to the sentence itself and subject to

16

habeas corpus restrictions.

17

The State amici, the 30 States who have

18

participated in this case on our behalf, have made very

19

strongly the argument that a -- that a stay of execution

20

in and of itself should be understood as a challenge to

21

the sentence.

22

The Court need not go so far in either respect

23

with us today.

All we ask the Court to hold today is that

24

where -- where an inmate both challenges a procedure for

25

carrying out his execution and, in essence, tries to tell

sentence.

Rule 32 has the same kind of factual innocence

was talking about, yes, you can file a new successive

7

State court petition under rule 32, but just as you have

For the 6-month time line that Mr. Newsom

In footnote 19 of our reply brief, I cite a

case, Tarver v. State.

MR. STEVENSON:

Well, he wants a stay to -- he

wants to enjoin the kind of conduct that we're talking

about here, but filing a stay motion in the Alabama

Supreme Court would not get him merits review where we

could present the kind of facts that we're now presenting.

position.

to Mr. Nelson until he got in front of the Federal judge.

14

In front of the Federal judge, they said for the first

time, we will try to do a peripheral stick, not

16

percutaneous invasion.

17

at page 109 of our joint appendix, the district court

finds -- and I'm reading here -- the defendants have

offered no explanation as to why they intend to use a cut足

placement.
