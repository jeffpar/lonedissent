ORAL ARGUMENT OF SAMUEL GODDARD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. GODDARD:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

10

The fundamental -- the fundamental question in

11

this case is whether the meaning of the term assessment,

12

as used in the Tax Injunction Act, includes Arizona's

13

school tax credit.

14

As this Court has written on several occasions,

15

the Tax Injunction Act has a very broad reach.

16

drastically limits the access to Federal district courts.

17

The act is relatively simple and -- and straightforward.

18

It's just 35 words, as I count it, and it specifically

19

says the Federal district courts shall not enjoin,

20

restrain, or suspend the assessment, levy, or collection

21

of a tax under State law where there is a plain, speedy,

22

and efficient remedy in the courts of that State.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

It

Where is the assessment here that --

that supposedly is being enjoined?
MR. GODDARD:

Your Honor, the assessment is the

calculation of a tax by the -- for the taxpayer.

2

words, it's the bottom line.

3

assessment and the dictionary meaning.

4

after you've done all the additions and subtractions and

5

you get to line 40 on the Arizona tax return form which

6

is --

7
8

QUESTION:

In other

It's the plain meaning of
It is what happens

It's -- it's a self-assessment?

So

you -- it's a self-assessment that's being enjoined?

9

MR. GODDARD:

Your Honor, I'm not talking about

10

a self-assessment.

11

colloquialism that talks about what all of us go through

12

as taxpayers.

13

the defendant in this case, Elliott Hibbs, the Director of

14

the Department of Revenue in Arizona, does both for

15

individual taxpayers and for all the taxpayers

16

collectively to determine what the State's revenues are

17

going to be from the taxpayers.

18

to the revenue is that bottom line on the tax form --

I believe a self-assessment is a

The assessment I'm talking about is what

QUESTION:

20

MR. GODDARD:

21
22

And the only way you get

Mr. Goddard --- after you've done all the

credits.
QUESTION:

Mr. Goddard, I thought that in a

23

self-assessment system, such as the one we have, the

24

Federal Government, Arizona, that assessment is associated

25

with assertion of a deficiency.

In Arizona, is every

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

taxpayer assessed by the government?

2

a different system, wouldn't it?

3

MR. GODDARD:

That would be quite

Your Honor, every taxpayer in

4

Arizona has their form calculated by the government.

5

check the math.

6
7

QUESTION:

You -- you audit everyone in the

State?

8
9

We

MR. GODDARD:

No, Your Honor.

I'm not trying to

say we audit everyone, but technically the assessment, and

10

as it is used also in the Internal Revenue Code to my

11

understanding, is the assessment -- and I'm quoting from

12

the Internal Revenue Code -- shall be made by recording

13

the liability of the taxpayer in the Office of the

14

Secretary.

15

QUESTION:

16

wants to assert a deficiency.

17

assessment just a week ago is nothing more than a

18

bookkeeping entry, and what it does is it triggers certain

19

administrative remedies.

20

assessment is made when the Government wants to assert a

21

deficiency.

22

bookkeeping entry someplace, that every taxpayer isn't

23

assessed.

24
25

Which the Government does when it
And we were told that the

But my understanding was that an

Otherwise, there isn't this entry, this

MR. GODDARD:

Your Honor, it is -- it is our

position that the State of Arizona under our State tax

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

system assesses all taxes in the State and that --

2
3

QUESTION:

When -- when does that happen?

When

the return is received in the office or?

4

MR. GODDARD:

It -- it returns during -- excuse

5

me.

6

somewhat fictional in terms of the -- of the director.

7

He's not going to sit down, as in the old days, with a

8

green eyeshade and write down a number for each taxpayer.

9

But he does, in fact, and his office does, in fact,

Your Honor, the -- the activity perhaps is -- is

10

calculate the gross revenues in the State, what credits

11

are going to be applied against those gross revenues,

12

various adjustments, and comes up with a bottom line.

13

that bottom line is our dictionary -- Black's Dictionary

14

definition of what an assessment is.

15

QUESTION:

And

But that's not the assessment that

16

you -- I mean, you used the Internal Revenue Code

17

provision.

18

bookkeeping entry.

19

levying liens, to extending the statute of limitations.

20

But it certainly isn't true that that kind of assessment,

21

which is what your brief suggested you were talking about,

22

is made in the case of every taxpayer.

23

That is an entry.

We were told it's a

And it's made as a prerequisite to

MR. GODDARD:

Your Honor, I'm not saying that

24

every taxpayer has a -- a specific entry next to their

25

name.

That would -- that would certainly be more than we

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

could do.

2

does, in fact, call for an assessment of the liability of

3

each taxpayer.

4

scheme fixed upon for charging and taxing, the Webster's

5

definition of assessment, is the bottom line.

6

that's the plain meaning that I'm trying to get to.

7

But our statutes, our tax system in Arizona

And that assessment, the entire plan,

QUESTION:

And I guess

Because I -- I assume that assessment

8

is -- is -- the assessment that we're concerned with is --

9

is within the meaning of Federal law.

10

But let me just ask you this question.

Do you

11

have a statute in Arizona that in effect says what the

12

department does with respect to each taxpayer is to assess

13

that taxpayer?

14

statement for some technical function that you go through

15

with respect to every taxpayer within the meaning of

16

Arizona law?

17

Does -- does that word occur as a

MR. GODDARD:

Your Honor, I -- I can't say that

18

we have that specific word in our statute.

19

certainly --

20

QUESTION:

We

Well, then -- then isn't your problem

21

this, that -- that there -- that that specific word is

22

used in the Federal statutes, quite apart from the Tax

23

Injunction Act?

24

as Justice Ginsburg's.

25

that involves a -- a predicate to the -- the assertion of

And -- and my understanding is the same
It is used in -- in a way that --

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a lien or -- or steps to collect a deficiency.

And -- and

2

that doesn't seem to be what is involved here.

Isn't --

3

isn't that a problem for you in your position?

4

MR. GODDARD:

Your Honor, I don't believe so

5

because the -- the first step -- and -- and the three

6

words in the statute I think are -- are certainly helpful:

7

assessment, levy, collection.

8

Congress --

9

QUESTION:

What essentially the

Well, there's no issue of a levy

10

going on here, and they're not trying to stop you from

11

collecting anything.

12

you ought to be collecting more, but they're certainly not

13

interfering in a way that's going to leave Arizona without

14

money while it litigates.

15

to litigate so that you'll get more money, and -- and so

16

that I suppose that's why the Ninth Circuit said why --

17

that the closest thing to a word involved here that --

18

that might let the statute apply is assessment.

19
20
21

I mean, their -- their argument is

MR. GODDARD:

What they're saying is we want

Yes, Your Honor, we believe

that -QUESTION:

And it didn't think it did.

But, I

22

mean, it seems to me that that's a basic textual problem

23

in -- in your case, and I don't understand how you get

24

around it.

25

QUESTION:

The technical assessment that's made

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

tied to a deficiency you don't fit.

2

about some other kind of assessment than the one that, for

3

example, the Government was telling us about last Monday

4

in the Galletti case, not that technical -- some -- if

5

we're talking about property, say, a property tax, then

6

maybe an assessor comes on the land, looks at the house,

7

attributes a value to it.

8

assessing system from the taxpayer's point of view.

9

-- but the income tax is quite different.

10

yourself.

11

So you're talking

That wouldn't be a selfBut

You assess

Sometimes you get audited; sometimes you don't.
And I don't see that anybody here is trying to

12

stop the government from making the assessment that would

13

be a trigger to asserting a deficiency.

14

to stop Arizona from asserting a deficiency against any

15

taxpayer.

16

MR. GODDARD:

No one is trying

No, Your Honor, but -- but what

17

we're asking for is that the -- the director, Mr. Hibbs,

18

be able to -- as the statute says, to implement the -- the

19

tax system under State law.

20

QUESTION:

Well, is it the case, though, that

21

other courts of appeal at the Federal level have concluded

22

that the Tax Injunction Act does not bar suits that would

23

increase State revenues rather than reduce them, that the

24

purpose of the Tax Injunction Act was to prevent reduction

25

of State tax revenues, specifically by corporations coming

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in and getting injunctions and preventing the State from

2

receiving revenues, but that it doesn't apply where the

3

effect of the -- the suit would be to increase the State's

4

coffers?

5

MR. GODDARD:

Your Honor, if I could deal with

6

-- there -- there are two questions, one, the legislative

7

history and -- and the -- as this Court has noted --

QUESTION:

addressed it.

MR. GODDARD:

QUESTION:

Only the Fifth Circuit has gone the

MR. GODDARD:

QUESTION:

Yes, but the others went the other

way on it.

19

MR. GODDARD:

The Fifth Circuit in ACLU

No, Your Honor.

submit that -- that that's not the case.

13
14

First of all, with the courts of

Ninth.

22

Your Honor, I could --

The Seventh, the Eighth, and the

Right?
MR. GODDARD:

Your Honor, there is -- is

23

language in the Seventh Circuit opinion which speaks about

24

this, but it is in a very limited sense in -- in Dunn v.

25

Kerry.

I don't think it's applicable here.

I'd be happy

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to discuss that.

2

I would refer the course also -- the Court also,

3

as our brief does, to First Circuit U.S. Brewers v. Perez

4

interpreting the Butler Act which is identical in language

5

to the Tax Injunction Act; to Kraebel v. New York Housing

6

Department in the Second Circuit which talks about a tax

7

benefit.

8

That's what we have on -- at -- at stake here is

9

we try -- the -- the respondents are trying to draw a

10

division between all State tax systems to say anything

11

that involves raising revenue is challengeable only in

12

State court, but if there's a benefit involved, if there's

13

anything else that accrues to the benefit of the taxpayer,

14

that has to go Federal court.

15

QUESTION:

I believe that's --

I don't know about that, but a -- a

16

challenge to a tax credit I think is what we're talking

17

about.

18

Right?
MR. GODDARD:

Well, Your Honor, I don't believe

19

there's any logical distinction between a deduction, an

20

exclusion, an exemption, and a credit.

21

QUESTION:

They all --

Well, I suppose you could -- I

22

suppose you could make the argument that it -- it's wrong

23

to say the State is only interested in increasing revenue.

24

The State may be interested in fairness for its taxpayers,

25

giving its taxpayers the -- the benefit of the lower rate.

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

That's certainly a -- a sound State policy.

2

MR. GODDARD:

Thank you, Your Honor.

I -- I

3

think that's one of the policies, if not the principal

4

policy, behind the Tax Injunction Act is respect for State

5

procedures and also --

6

QUESTION:

General Goddard, the -- what we've

7

been talking about is this section of 1341 that talks

8

about assessment, levy, or collection of any debt.

9

three words fit perfectly into a property tax scheme.

Those

10

They really don't fit nearly as well into an income tax

11

scheme.

12

that the -- the act does apply to income tax as well as

13

property tax?

14

Are there cases from courts of appeals that say

MR. GODDARD:

Yes, Your Honor, and that

15

distinction -- the cases I'm referring to involve both.

16

And -- and you're absolutely correct.

17

property tax oriented.

18

That's true of several others.

19

another that I would cite showing a tax benefit not a tax

20

deduction to the State.

21

Many of them are

That's true of In re Gillis.
Colonial Pipeline is

But the most precisely on point is ACLU

22

Foundation v. Bridges from the Fifth Circuit,

23

interestingly after a couple of other cases which might

24

have -- which have been cited by the respondents for their

25

proposition that -- that somehow the revenue -- I mean,

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the State revenue -- things that give revenues to the

2

State are significantly different from items that benefit

3

the taxpayer.

4

under the scheme that this Court has discussed in the six

5

cases that -- where it has discussed the Tax Injunction

6

Act in detail speak about a much broader application.

7

I would submit that under this scheme and

QUESTION:

You were going to go to the history

8

or something else.

9

and the reason I don't want you to forget is I'm thinking

10

I -- I don't want you to forget that,

yours is a plausible interpretation --

11

MR. GODDARD:

12

QUESTION:

13

could.

Thank you, Your Honor.

-- that could be -- well, I mean, it

I'm about to say maybe it isn't plausible enough.

14

(Laughter.)

15

QUESTION:

The -- the -- but what I'm -- what

16

I'm driving at is that the -- the Congress might have said

17

that although Federal courts are in the business quite

18

often, along with State courts, of deciding whether a

19

State law is unconstitutional or violates some other

20

Federal law, and although millions of State laws are very

21

important, we're separating out a set of cases here where

22

they can't do it.

23

Now, one reason for doing that would be we don't

24

want to interfere with States getting money that they need

25

for their business.

And that would limit these words to

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

interferences with collection of revenue.

2

MR. GODDARD:

3

QUESTION:

4

Now, you were about to explain to me

why --

5

MR. GODDARD:

6

QUESTION:

7

Yes, Your Honor.

I -- I would --

-- there's evidence that Congress

wanted to do more than that.

8

MR. GODDARD:

9

QUESTION:

I would greatly appreciate --

It wanted to do more than that.

It

10

wanted, in fact, to say you just can't stop them from --

11

you cannot, Federal courts, go and have our tax division

12

here interfered with, even though it doesn't affect

13

collection of revenue.

14

interfere with their rules, with their administration,

15

with anything.

16

but not the tax.

MR. GODDARD:
words of the statute.
QUESTION:

Well, the first evidence is the
They didn't just say collections.

All right.

The words -- I think

they're pretty ambiguous.

23

MR. GODDARD:

24

collections, though, Your Honor.

25

QUESTION:

They -- well, they don't just say

No, I know.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. GODDARD:

They say assessment and levy.

2

Those words are not modified.

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. GODDARD:

5

Also, the history of the Tax Injunction Act --

Let's go beyond these words.
Thank you.

6

it comes from a period when the -- the Congress was

7

reacting to this Court's decision in Ex parte Young, and

8

they felt that extensive equitable relief against State

9

officials was inappropriate, and they passed several laws,

10

the Johnson Act and the Tax Injunction Act in the '30's

11

being the most important, which spoke very broadly about

12

keeping in State courts State proceedings.

13

say anything about just collections, although --

14

QUESTION:

They did not

Mr. Goddard, in that -- in that

15

regard, wasn't what Congress had in mind -- it was

16

taxpayer suits.

17

through the whole process.

18

come up under the Tax Injunction Act are taxpayers who say

19

please enjoin the tax or don't assess me or don't levy.

20

But this is not that kind of case.

21

They didn't want taxpayers to avoid going
I mean, most of the cases that

There's no one here who's trying to stop the

22

State from collecting revenue.

23

taxpayer, and that at the time of the Tax Injunction Act,

24

I don't think that kind of action was even on the scene.

25

Do you have any claims where a non-taxpayer was seeking to

It's an attack by a non-

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

enjoin the collection of a tax?

2

What they -- what -- what Congress was aiming at

3

is that, taxpayer, you've got a prompt, speedy, efficient

4

remedy in your State, you use that, don't rush to the

5

Federal court.

6

MR. GODDARD:

Your -- Your Honor, the -- the

7

Congress had several reasons, and -- and you're absolutely

8

correct that one of the primary ones was not allowing

9

taxpayers, especially out of State, to come in and

10

interrupt the flow of taxes.

11

was a -- a very important reason.

12

I'm not denying that that

But as this Court has said in Rosewell v.

13

LaSalle National Bank, if that was the only reason that

14

they were concerned about the collection of taxes, they

15

could have said so.

16

jurisdiction cases will be barred from Federal court.

17

They did not.

18

courts shall not consider cases to restrain, enjoin, or

19

suspend actions for the assessment, levy, and collection

20

of taxes.

They could have said only diversity

They used -- they said essentially district

21

They also --

QUESTION:

23

That was a taxpayer's case too,

wasn't it?

MR. GODDARD:

we don't have a taxpayer who's not trying to stop any

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

22

25

MR. HUNGAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The position of the United States is that
respondents' suit is barred by the plain language of the

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

Tax Injunction Act because it seeks to enjoin and restrain

2

the assessment of a tax under State law.

3

And to turn directly to the --

4

QUESTION:

May I ask you if you think the

5

language is so plain that we should not even look at the

6

legislative history?

7

MR. HUNGAR:

We think it's -- yes.

We think

8

that the -- the language is sufficiently plain that

9

there's no need to look at the legislative history, but

10

that if you do, the legislative history also supports the

11

interpretation we advance.

12

QUESTION:

And Judge Easterbrook was just dead

13

wrong in looking at the legislative history and he also

14

interpreted it dead wrong.

15

MR. HUNGAR:

Judge -- the case before Judge

Easterbrook, Justice Stevens, was quite different from

this case.

tax collector administered the tax code, but rather a suit

23

that case were obviously quite different from those what

24

we have -- where we have presented here.

25

That involved not an -- a -- a suit against

MR. HUNGAR:

QUESTION:

Yes.

The -- the -- if you use the word

enjoin to mean command, which it can mean, can you say

9

that they are commanding the collection of a tax, contrary

11

to the words of the statute?
MR. HUNGAR:

Yes.

We think that is also quite

12

correct here.

13

Ninth Circuit, but that is certainly another way to get to

14

the result which we think is the correct result, that the

15

plain language of the statute bars this kind of suit.

16

That was not the issue addressed by the

Turning to the questions about the meaning of

And in fact, the Internal Revenue Code so provides.

12

QUESTION:

That every taxpayer is assessed even

when there's no deficiency.

13

MR. HUNGAR:

Correct.

Well, if a taxpayer files

14

a return showing a bottom line calculation of how much tax

15

is due after all credits, deductions, and so forth have

16

been taken into account, that amount and -- and the tax --

17

and the IRS checks the addition, concludes that it's

18

accurate, and is not conducting an audit, that amount is

19

assessed.

20

of course, it's on the computer.

21

It's -- it's recorded in the transcript.

QUESTION:

Now,

You don't have to send them a notice

What plaintiffs are seeking to do is prevent and restrain

13

includes, as part of the assessment, computation and

the suit in this case would preclude the tax collector

MR. HUNGAR:

collector there, the Department of Revenue, makes a

determination or reviews the returns and ultimately either

4

determines that that amount will be accepted, that -- that

5

the amount of tax shown on the return is the -- going to

6

be accepted as the amount of tax due from the tax

7

collector, or that they're going to try to require some --

8

you know, assess a deficiency or whatever it may be.

9

But in either case, within the meaning of

10

Federal law, the tax collector's determination of what the

11

amount is due, either if it's the amount shown on return

12

MR. HUNGAR:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, I'm

16

the tax collector looks at the returns when they come in,

further.

of the statute.
QUESTION:

MR. HUNGAR:

It's -- it's not applicable here,

would be quite extraordinary for Federal courts to be in

20

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22
23

MR. COHEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
I'll begin by stating what our position is.

The

24

Tax Injunction Act and the associated principles of comity

25

only -- only -- apply when a district court is asked to

The decisions of this Court support

In challenges to tax credits, the Tax Injunction

Act has been either not considered at all by this Court or

10

they've specifically held that the Tax Injunction Act did

It -- this is -- also our position is consistent

procedures?

MR. COHEN:

Your Honor, we view the phrase,

enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment, levy, or

collection, as a phrase.

7

The -- at the time the word assessment was first used, it

was 1867 in the Federal Anti-Injunction Act, which was the

20

model for the Tax Injunction Act in 1937, as this Court

21

held in Jefferson County.

22

-- the assessment process which was valuing property -- if

23

that had been stopped, then -- then they wouldn't get to

24

the collection phase, or if they stopped the levy phase,

25

they wouldn't get to the collection phase.

And at that time if a -- and a

the concept was that it took these three things to make

2

the flow of revenue come to the State.

3

And that while individuals have an option under

4

the section 1983 and 1343 together to choose either the

5

Federal or State courts in which to vindicate their

6

constitutional rights, the Congress decided that they

7

should not have that option if it could interfere -- if it

MR. COHEN:

Justice Kennedy, in Jefferson

collecting.

What is he supposed to do?

MR. COHEN:

Justice Scalia, he obeys the order

of the court and he's -- he's only enjoined from --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. COHEN:

Well, that means -He's only enjoined with regard to

7

the tax credit.

8

which includes not honoring the tax credit.

9

He's not enjoined from collecting the tax

QUESTION:

And I take that -- I take it that's

10

the answer to -- to Justice Kennedy's question, that his

11

obligation to collect the tax is an obligation under State

12

law, and once he is enjoined from recognizing the credit,

13

he simply follows State law and collects the tax without

14

reference to the credit.

15

doesn't say, you go out and collect the tax.

16

law does that.

The Federal court, conversely,
The State

Is -- is -- do you buy that?

MR. COHEN:

Yes, absolutely.
He believes the district court

decision is wrong, and let's assume it is wrong.

he supposed to do while it is on appeal?

MR. COHEN:

Unless it -- Your Honor, unless it

is stayed, he is to obey it, and --

MR. COHEN:

the flow of revenue to the State, and that's what the Tax

2

Injunction Act is basically about.

QUESTION:

He -- he obeys the injunction and he

obeys State law except with respect to the credit which he

5

is enjoined from giving.

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

the -- the full tax.

9

MR. COHEN:

10

QUESTION:

I agree, Your Honor.
And the result is that he collects
That's the way it would work.
That's correct, Your Honor.
Suppose -- suppose the State law says

11

if these tax credits are invalidated, all other taxpayers

12

shall be assessed an additional 2 percent to make up for

13

-- I'm sorry.

14

invalidated, other taxpayers shall be -- their taxes shall

15

be reduced by 1 percent.

16

looks forward to this possibility that there will be an

17

injunction.

18

Is he to assess everybody else at a lesser amount?

If these -- if these tax credits are

Okay?

I mean, the -- the State

What is the Secretary of State to do then?

19

MR. COHEN:

20

QUESTION:

Your Honor, I believe -In other words, he is prevented from

21

collecting the additional amount that he would have had to

22

collect from other taxpayers had this tax credit been

23

acknowledged.

24

law says is, if it's struck down, you have to collect more

25

from everybody else.

The tax credit is struck down, and what the

Now, I assume in that situation the

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

district court would not be able to enjoin the collection,

2

would it?

4
5

So all you're talking about is whether the State
law is -- is drafted in a clever way or not.
MR. COHEN:

Your Honor, if -- if the tax credit

6

is struck down, the State gets more money.

7

to assess an additional 1 or 2 percent of its taxpayers.

8

But if -- if the State in its wisdom chose to do so, then

9

whoever collects taxes would obey the State law until

10

another case came to court and another judge told them

11

what to do.

12
13
14

QUESTION:
some interference.

All right.

It has no need

So -- so there would be

But what do you do about the word?

I mean, I'm somewhat shaken by the fact that the

15

-- the Internal Revenue Code does -- as I have just read

16

6201 and 6203, it does use that word assessment as

17

apparently to refer simply to the record keeping function

18

of the tax division which it says under rules and

19

regulations the assessment shall be made by recording the

20

liability of the taxpayer in the Office of the Secretary.

21

And therefore, what it seems to have in mind in the IRC is

22

a simple bookkeeping notation of how much money this

23

taxpayer owes which takes place in every case.

24
25

Now, the -- the act says there shall be no suit
that restrains the assessment of that tax; i.e., you

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

cannot restrain the Secretary in noting the amount that

2

the taxpayer owes.

3

Now, they're saying stop right there.

4

the matter.

5

argument?

6

End of

Now, what in your opinion overcomes that

MR. COHEN:

Your Honor, Justice Breyer, it's

7

interesting about the Internal Revenue Code and the -- the

8

Federal income tax law because there is a corollary to the

9

Tax Injunction Act:

the Anti-Injunction Act of 1867.

And

10

it uses the word assessment.

11

Federal court decisions saying that that does not apply to

12

tax credits.

13
14

And there are a number of

And in each --

QUESTION:

That's not an answer for the

reason --

15

MR. COHEN:

16

QUESTION:

May I --- that they're saying they're wrong,

17

just as they say we were wrong in five cases not to notice

18

this.

19

So continue, please.
MR. COHEN:

Yes.

None of them -- none of them

20

looked at the word assessment in isolation.

21

looked at -- what those cases looked at was the phrase, as

22

-- as I've suggested to the Court, that the phrase

23

assessment, levy, and collection is the process of

24

creating the flow of revenue.

MR. COHEN:

The -- Justice Scalia, it -- it is

2

or for purposes of saying that you can't restrain any of

3

those because if you restrain any of those in the context

4

of creating the stream of revenue, you have stopped the

5

stream of revenue.

7

And that -- that's what history of the

QUESTION:

So your answer is this.

8

indeed they've got it correctly defined.

9

assessment.

You say

Indeed, it says

It says assessment, levy, or collection.

But

10

that phrase does not refer to every assessment, levy, or

11

collection.

12

assessments, levies, and collections that will have, were

13

they enjoined, the impact of cutting the revenue stream

14

flowing to the State.

Rather, in context it refers to those

at that in context.

these other things.

MR. COHEN:

MR. COHEN:

That's our position, Your Honor.
That's your view.

So we should look

That's why you go to the history and

That's correct, Your Honor.
All right.

I understand.

I -- I would like to also point out

22

to the Court that this use of a tax credit as a mechanism

23

could also to -- that is to funnel money to school tuition

24

organizations could just as well have been an

25

appropriation of dollars and vouchers.

And if instead the

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

State was giving vouchers to school tuition organizations,

2

93 percent of which went to religious schools, there would

3

be no question about the individual citizen's option to

4

choose to go to the Federal court.

5

QUESTION:

But it wasn't done that way.

I mean,

6

it's just like saying it could have been extracted by

7

torture too, and that would have been clearly

8

unconstitutional.

9

(Laughter.)

10
11

QUESTION:

But that happens not to be the way it

MR. COHEN:

That's correct, Your Honor, but in

was done.

12
13

Nyquist this Court particularly pointed out that a tax

14

credit was the same as giving money to the State.

15

that was this Court dealing with a tax credit that --

16

where the money was used to support religious schools,

17

which is just what we're asserting here.

18

QUESTION:

Mueller certainly distinguished that

part of Nyquist.

21

That --

MR. COHEN:

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

didn't --

QUESTION:

The Mueller against Allen case surely

5

QUESTION:

In a tax

Why should -- why should that make

any difference to your argument?

6

MR. COHEN:

It -- generally, it wouldn't, but a

7

tax credit is every dollar that goes to the benefit of the

8

school tuition organization -- if it wasn't given to them,

9

every dollar of that would go to the State.

In a tax

10

deduction, a tax deduction is a more generalized --

11

helping to support charity, and only a portion of that

12

money goes to the State --

13

QUESTION:

Yes.

It may be -- it may be a

14

smaller amount, but in both cases it goes to the person

15

who -- who claims it.

16

MR. COHEN:

17

but it's a smaller percentage.

18

it's dollar for dollar.

there were a number of considerations when you deal with a

it's the taxpayer who's designating a certain portion of

used.

The word assessment then was
That's

And -- and it would be perfectly

14

natural in the real estate tax context to use them in that

order because the assessment comes first.

argument of your opponents here is the assessment is the

counter-intuitive if you're -- when you're referring to

income taxes.

MR. COHEN:

QUESTION:

Whereas, the

I -- I agree, Justice Stewart.

MR. COHEN:

Mr. Justice Breyer, no, I do not

We haven't done a survey of the States.
QUESTION:

But the question I was going to put

7

was you -- you say that the -- the principal purpose of

8

this law was to protect the fisc of the State.

9

you know, I will concede that, that -- that what Congress

And I --

10

was most concerned about was preventing somebody from

11

stopping the State from collecting money.

12

unusual that Congress drafts its prohibitions broader than

13

is necessary to achieve just the narrow purpose.

14

indeed they -- they prohibited not just stopping the

15

collection but also stopping the assessment, it seems to

16

me we have to take the statute for what it says, if indeed

17

this is an assessment.

18

beyond what the principal purpose was, I mean, that --

19

that's often the case with statutes.

20

MR. COHEN:

But it's not

And if

And the mere fact that it goes

Justice Scalia, the State contends

21

and the United States both contend that this statute is --

22

the purpose of it was to stop any court -- Federal court

23

interference with the tax administration process itself.

24

And the -- the Federal court decisions, other than

25

Bridges, reject that point of view.

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And this Court rejected that point of view in

2

Jefferson County when the -- the issue there was that the

3

county had sued in the State court against Federal judges

4

to try to get an occupational tax.

5

removed the case to Federal court, and the county said,

6

well, the Tax Injunction Act applies here because the

7

Federal judges are going to raise State tax issues and

8

this Federal court will be deciding cases having to do

9

with State tax administration.

And the Federal judges

And they cited the

10

Kelleher case out of the Second Circuit which it held that

11

the Tax Injunction Act was so broad that it applied to tax

12

-- all State tax administration.

13

that position, and this Court I believe unanimously

14

overruled Kelleher.

15

QUESTION:

And this Court rejected

So we -Mr. Cohen, we are ships passing in

16

the night because you're -- I don't care what the purpose

17

was.

18

very often the language goes beyond the narrow purpose

that Congress had in mind.

does so, we read the statute as it's written, but you

don't -- don't agree with that apparently.

2

that is the way the Federal courts -- the way we're

suggesting is the way the Federal courts have interpreted

this language.

5

And we suggest that if there's a problem, as

6

long as the tax revenue is flowing to the State and we're

not interfering -- we're not stopping that, if there's a

8

problem with -- with that system that's been there now

for, oh, 100, 60 years for States, 140 years for the

10

Federal fisc, if there's a problem, the States can take

is an exemption from the Federal jurisdiction, which under

MR. GODDARD:

If -- if I may go to the overriding principle

the actions of the State and should be appropriate here.

7

Thank you, Your Honor.

As this Court said in -- many years ago under

8

the principle of comity, which Mr. Cohen referred to,

9

comity refers to the scrupulous regard for the rightful

10

independence of State governments which should at all

times actuate the Federal courts and a proper reluctance

12

to interfere by injunction with their fiscal operations.
