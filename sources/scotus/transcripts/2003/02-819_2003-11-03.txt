CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 02-819, Andrew J. Kontrick v. Robert A. Ryan.
Mr. Poor.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. KING POOR

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8

10

MR. POOR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
This case presents a single question: Can the

11

deadline for objecting to a bankruptcy discharge be

12

altered by equitable exceptions?

13

we start with the language of the rules.

14

4004 states that an objection to discharge must be filed

15

no later than 60 days after the first date set for the

16

meeting of creditors.

17

extension of the time, but only by motion and only if that

18

motion is filed, quote, before the time expires.

19

To answer that question,
Bankruptcy Rule

This rule also allows for an

QUESTION: Mr. Poor, may I suggest that the

20

question you have raised is not the one that I understood

21

this case to involve.

22

allows for equitable exceptions, it's whether you

23

forfeited that claim, the claim that it does not - whether

24

you forfeited it by letting the thing go past your answer.

25

You didn't raise it in your answer.

It's not whether the provision

You let the case go

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

off on summary judgment on the merits and remained silent

2

until after there was an adverse judgment against you.

3

at least in my thinking, the forfeiture question, whether

4

you forfeited, the argument that you would now like us to

5

treat as the question presented, that is the threshold

6

question.

7

So

MR. POOR: And I - and I would agree with Your

8

Honor that the question of waiver, or sometimes referred

9

to as forfeiture, is - is part of - that is the question

10

that's before your Court, whether that - the fact that we

11

had not raised it until some later date is something that

12

can be waived or forfeited.

13

QUESTION: Well, Mr. Poor -

14

QUESTION: I - I would agree with Justice

15

Ginsburg that that's the way that the question reads on

16

the petition for writ of certiorari.

17

you did set forth, that the parties did set forth in the

18

joint appendix the chronology here.

19

first time your client raised the late filing issue was

20

June 23, 2000, or am I wrong about that?

21

MR. POOR: No, Your Honor.

It's helpful that

I take it that the

We raised it in March

22

of 2000 in a motion to reconsider, but we also have

23

maintained -

24
25

QUESTION: Oh, that was in the motion to
reconsider?

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. POOR: Correct, but I would hasten to add

2

that we have steadfastly maintained that we raised it in

3

opposition to the motion for summary judgment in that we

4

specifically said that the family account claim was not in

5

the original complaint, and that to be timely, a claim had

6

to be in that - that original complaint.
QUESTION: But in that very pleading you asked

7
8

the court to strike a number of things in the complaint,

9

and yet you did not ask to strike the family account

10

claim.
MR. POOR: Well, Your Honor, we have maintained

11
12

that we did and in the context of this QUESTION: But you didn't - did you expressly say

13
14

that you wanted those certain allegations struck?
MR. POOR: Well, we did as best we could at the

15
16

time because this was part of a QUESTION: Did you - did you say, court, strike

17
18

these allegations?

19

MR. POOR: Yes.

20

QUESTION: Yes, the answer is yes?

21

MR. POOR: Yes, we believe we - we did, Your

22
23
24
25

Honor.
QUESTION: And you did not say, strike with
respect to this allegation?
MR. POOR: Not specifically as to that, and

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that's - and that's what the - what the bankruptcy court

2

found.

3

other allegations, and we felt that we had raised it

4

sufficiently by -

5

However, at the time this was part of a mass of

QUESTION: What was your reason for

6

distinguishing the two, for saying strike others, but as

7

to this one all that you did was mention that it wasn't in

8

the original complaint?

9
10

MR. POOR: Well, we felt that that was - at the in the opposition we raised the 4004 untimeliness issue.

11

There were just a number of others that were not even in

12

the - any complaint.

13

QUESTION: Well, if we're going to get into all

14

of that, then they would say there's a relation back and

15

none of those issues are really before.

16

on the pure question of whether or not, assuming that you

17

were late in objecting that that - that that's a bar.

We took the issue

18

MR. POOR: That's correct, Your Honor, and I -

19

QUESTION: Mr. Poor, there are cases with which

20

I'm sure you're familiar where a statute of limitations

21

has been held to be deemed waived, even though there's

22

nothing in the statute itself talking about waiver.

23

MR. POOR: That's correct, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION: And this is much like that, is it not?

25

There's a provision in the rules for a deadline for making

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a claim, but perhaps as in a statute of limitations case,

2

it's not an extension of time to find a waiver.

3

it's a different concept, and maybe should be viewed much

4

like a waiver of a statute of limitations.

5

It's -

MR. POOR: Well, in this case, Your Honor, this

6

deadline is very much unlike a classic statute of

7

limitations where you have a, say, a 2-year statute.

8

is different because here the language of the 60 days is

9

modified or altered by Bankruptcy Rule 4 - 9006(b).

This

The

10

rulemakers didn't stop with the 60-day deadline.

11

stated that this rule will be incorporated into a special

12

subgroup of other rules that may only be extended, quote,

13

to the extent and under the conditions stated.

14

QUESTION: But what's your answer to the argument

15

that a waiver is not an extension, it's a waiver?

16

a different kettle of fish.

17

They

That's

MR. POOR: Well, it - any - any attempt to excuse

18

a late filing, whether it is waiver, equitable estoppel,

19

and it could be waiver in the sense of it's an implied

20

waiver where a debtor, by inaction, does not raise it, or

21

it could be a situation where there's a stipulation by the

22

debtor to - with the creditor and says, after the deadline

23

the creditor goes to the debtor and says, I want you to

24

stipulate to a late time period.

25

you take the plain language of 4004 and 9006(b), that

In the language here, if

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

plain language simply does not allow for any type of

2

equitable exceptions, whether they're deemed to be waiver

3

or forfeiture or if -

4

QUESTION: But you could make the same argument

5

for an ordinary statute of limitations that doesn't talk

6

about waiver or equitable alteration.

7

MR. POOR: You - and that's correct, Your Honor,

8

for an ordinary statute of limitations.

9

different for this reason, that the presumption here is

10

that when the drafters adopted 9006, what they did was

11

they patterned it after Federal Rule of Civil Procedure

12

6(b), almost - almost virtually identically, and the

13

language of 6(b), on which 9006(b) is patterned, has had a

14

long history of being - had an established meaning as

15

setting jurisdictional deadlines and - for its own

16

subgroup of rules, and those rules, as this Court held in

17

the Robinson case, we must presume that rules that are

18

based on that 6(b) rule are presumed to be - to have the

19

same meaning, that is, in the words of the Robinson case,

20

as mandatory and jurisdictional.

21
22

This one is

QUESTION: Well, do you think that Rule 4004(a)
limits the Court's subject matter jurisdiction?

23

MR. POOR: Not in the least, Your Honor, and I

24

think that's a very important distinction in this case,

25

because I think that's where the court below got off the

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

trail in focusing on the concept of subject matter

2

jurisdiction.

This case does not deal with subject matter

3

jurisdiction.

That's the idea that - whether the court

4

has the competency.

5

instance, the Circuit Court of Cook County was the proper

6

court to hear this objection.

7

We're not saying that the, for

In this case we're talking about an entirely

8

different concept, and that is jurisdiction used in the

9

sense that a court may not extend a deadline beyond the

10

plain meaning of the rule with any type of equitable

11

exception, whether it's called -

12

QUESTION: Why do you pin the word jurisdiction

13

on it at all when rules, whether bankruptcy rules or

14

creditor rules, cannot alter or affect the Court's

15

jurisdiction?

16

so whatever it is, it - if it is jurisdiction, then it

17

violates - the rule violates the statute.

18

passed by Congress.

19

That's what both rules' enabling acts say,

The rule isn't

MR. POOR: I - and I - I, Your Honor, and as I

20

recall in Your Honor's concurrence in the Carlisle case,

21

you pointed out that to use the term subject matter

22

jurisdiction for something like this, for a time

23

prescription, is - is anomalous, where in - in this case

24

if we're not - we're not dealing with subject matter

25

jurisdiction, we're talking about jurisdiction as a

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

shorthand for a time QUESTION: You're talking about a rigid time

2
3

limit, a time limit that cannot be extended for good

4

cause.

5

MR. POOR: Exactly, and I - I know there are a

6

number of courts that decline to even use the term

7

jurisdiction, because they think that that's probably not

8

the best term to use.

9

It's used by many courts.

QUESTION: Could you - could you have, according

10

to your analysis of what this animal is, here you made

11

your motion to reconsider after the summary judgment

12

motion was granted, but before judgment was entered -

13

MR. POOR: Correct.

14

QUESTION:

- final judgment was entered.
Could you then

15

Suppose final judgment had been entered.

16

come into the court and say, sorry, court, I forgot to

17

tell you that you couldn't enter any judgment here because

18

an unalterable time bar had passed?

19

MR. POOR: I think, so long as it's within the

20

same proceeding, Your Honor, you could, and that's - that

21

was the holding in the Kirsch case, which the Seventh -

22

QUESTION: How about initially on appeal?

23

Suppose you - you suffered the adverse judgment in the

24

bankruptcy court and then you want to raise that, after

25

all, the complaint was untimely, on appeal for the first

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

time?
MR. POOR: I think that that would probably be a

2
3

rare instance, but I think that in - if it is

4

jurisdictional or unalterable, then so long as it's within

5

the same proceeding that's just - that is part of what a

6

jurisdictional rule is.
QUESTION: Do you have any authority with respect

7
8

to this kind of rule, a rigid time limit, that it's okay

9

to untimely bring that to the court's attention?

I mean,

10

all the precedent that your brief cites are cases where

11

the party who opposes the time extension timely brings up

12

that the complaint was untimely.
MR. POOR: We have cited a number of those, Your

13
14

Honor, in our - both our opening brief and our reply

15

brief, and I would invite the Court's attention to QUESTION: Where the defendant was untimely -

16
17

that -

18

MR. POOR: Yes, Your Honor.

19

QUESTION: - where as here?

20

MR. POOR: Yes, and - and even more extreme, a

21

more extreme example, if I would invite the Court's

22

attention to the Dollar case, where after the time limit

23

had passed, the creditor went to the debtor and says -

24

said I want you to extend the time limit, and for whatever

25

reason, the debtor said, okay, I'll agree to that, and

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

then they brought that to the bankruptcy court for

2

approval and the bankruptcy court said, no, this is a

3

jurisdictional time limit, you can't have a side deal with

4

a creditor QUESTION: That was a case where the court made

5
6

an - an initial ruling without having expended any time in

7

adjudicating the case.

8

where the court grants a motion for summary judgment and

9

then the debtor says, sorry, court, you never should have

Here, you present the situation

10

adjudicated this.

We didn't tell you, but now you have to

11

erase all - everything that you did.

12

MR. POOR: Well -

13

QUESTION: I did - was not aware of such a case.

14

MR. POOR: Well, there - there are a number of

15

them where they're not raised in the - there's a whole

16

spectrum.

QUESTION: Raised after the case is adjudicated

17
18

They're not raised in the answer -

on the merits?
MR. POOR: Yes.

19

The Kirsch case is one case

20

where it - actually after trial, in Kirsch, the court

21

found that since the rule - and I - it was not alterable

22

under the plain meaning of the twin here, this 4004, 4007,

23

that that could not be altered, even after a trial, and as

24

I recall, the Poskanzer case is yet another one of those

25

where -

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: Who made those decision where the -

2

MR. POOR: The - the Kirsch case is from the

3

bankruptcy court in the Northern District of Illinois, and

4

- and the Poskanzer case is from New Jersey and we cite a

5

number of them in page 16 and in our footnote on that -

6

QUESTION: The - the law - like - like the time

7

limit here, the law is unalterable, and if you fail to

8

make a legal argument at the trial level, you're not

9

normally permitted to raise that argument on appeal where

10

you haven't raised the objection below.

11

MR. POOR: That -

12

QUESTION: The court - the court doesn't say,

13

well, the law is unalterable so you're entitled to - to

14

raise this point at any stage in the proceeding.

15

That's -

that's just not the way we do things, and that's why we

16

do have this terminology jurisdictional.

17

something special about that, but the mere fact that

18

something is unalterable certainly doesn't allow you to

19

raise it whenever you like.

20

There is

MR. POOR: Well, Your Honor, the - to go back to

21

the - the concept of - of waiver or - or forfeiture, if

22

the rule is - is truly jurisdictional, using the shorthand

23

that it cannot be altered, then -

24
25

QUESTION: No, no, no.
of my question.

That was the point of -

It is not a synonym for - for the term

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

jurisdictional that it can't be altered.

There are a lot

2

of things that - that can't be altered which you're not

3

allowed to raise late.
MR. POOR: But if - if the rule itself, for

4
5

instance, does not allow a - a debtor and a creditor to

6

extend this time line themselves, then it would be, I

7

submit, anomalous to allow the debtor to do, by inaction,

8

what the Court could never do on its own or - or permit a

9

rule that says that QUESTION: Well, that - that's like saying you

10
11

cannot let the defendant change the law by merely failing

12

to raise a legal objection that was fully available.

13

not changing the law, he's just forfeited the - that - the

14

benefit of that provision of law.

He's

15

MR. POOR: Well, if it can be forfeited, Your

16

Honor, then I would submit that it can also be waived.

17

could be - and -

It

QUESTION: What's - what's the citation of that?

18
19

I mean, you refer to Rule 6, and Rule 6 governs a whole

20

lot of famous time limits, new trials, 60(b) motions, et

21

cetera.

22

the following thing happened: Somebody made a motion under

23

Rule 59, or whatever it is, out of time, all right, a day

24

late -

25

So, therefore, there must be a lot of cases where

MR. POOR: A day -

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: A day late.

2

MR. POOR: Right.

3

QUESTION: And then nobody said a word about it.

4

Then one year later, for the first time on appeal, the

5

other side says, oh, I agree we never said a word about

6

this before so we're raising it now for the first time,

7

and the court said, fine, you can raise it for the first

8

time.

9

I'm not saying there aren't any, I haven't faced this

Now, what are the cases that hold that?

I mean,

10

before, but I would have thought it comes up million - you

11

know, quite a lot of times where people forget to - or

12

they don't care or whatever it is, and they raise

13

something very late.

What are those cases?

MR. POOR: Well, I - I would invite the Court's

14
15

attention to the cases that we cite on pages 16 and 17,

16

such as the - the Rinde case, debtor failed to plead QUESTION: No, I'm not talking about bankruptcy.

17
18

I'm talking about Rule 6, ordinary civil cases.
MR. POOR: Well, I can - I can point the Court to

19
20

a case that is in that 6(b) family, in the Criminal Rule

21

45(b).

22

QUESTION: I'm talking about civil rules of

23

procedure, ordinary civil cases.

Probably there are, I

24

would guess conservatively 100,000 cases a year that may

25

fall into this category.

In a certain percentage of

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those, the deadlines will be missed -

2

MR. POOR: And -

3

QUESTION: - and in a certain percentage of that

4

percentage, the other side will have said nothing -

5

MR. POOR: And -

6

QUESTION: - waking up on appeal.

7

MR. POOR: And in -

8

QUESTION: And then there must be a lot of cases,

9

if you're right, that would say, that's okay.

I'm just

10

repeating myself because I think there are no cases and I

11

think, to me, that shows you're wrong, but now I'm open to

12

hearing that there are a lot or even one.

13
14
15
16
17
18
19

MR. POOR: Well, I would - I would invite the
Court to the Kirsch case that we cite in our brief.
QUESTION: Is Kirsch a bankruptcy case?

I'm not

talking about a bankruptcy case.
QUESTION: District court - that's a district
court case.
MR. POOR: In - in Kirsch, the court relied upon

20

that 6(b) analysis in a case called Hulson from the

21

Seventh Circuit, where just such a thing happened where

22

after the - after trial the - the party did not - did not

23

file his Rule 59 motion on time and actually the other

24

side - they stipulated to an untimely rule - they

25

stipulated to it, and then on appeal in that case they -

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Seventh Circuit said, we don't care if you stipulated

2

to it, it's untimely and you cannot QUESTION: All right, so that would definitely

3
4

support you, and what's the name of that case?

5

MR. POOR: That's Hulson, H-u-l-s-o-n.

6

QUESTION: All right.

7

MR. POOR: And that's - and that was the basis -

8
9
10

that was the basis of this whole analysis in the Kirsch
case.
QUESTION: Under your - your view of the law,

11

could the respondent here, the creditor have argued that

12

this amendment relates back to the complaint?

13

MR. POOR: Relation back has never been in our -

14
15

QUESTION: Could he - could he have made that

16

argument under your view of the law, post-judgment, after

17

you - March 2000, it was decided in 1980 - 90 - 99, March

18

2000, you object.

19

oh, well, this relates back, it's okay?

At that point, could the creditor say,

20

MR. POOR: He - he could have, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION: All right.

Well, then what you're

22

doing is you're putting this issue potentially in the

23

appellate courts.

24
25

We don't do that sort of thing.

It's -

it's for the trial judge to say it relates back or not.
MR. POOR: Well -

QUESTION: And that's - that's - you put all of
the parties in a very difficult position by your rule.
QUESTION: Didn't the court of appeals said - say

4

you didn't suggest that it related back, therefore,

5

they're assuming it didn't?

6

MR. POOR: That's correct, that we - we - we've

7

never argued the - there's never - the relation back issue

8

was never before the Seventh Circuit.

9

QUESTION: I'm not saying it is before, but I'm

10

saying under your view, under your framework, it would be

11

very difficult to handle that at such a late point, and

12

it's a legitimate argument that they could have made.

13

MR. POOR: If they - they raised it on appeal, as

14

it might be a - an issue.

I think it's probably more

15

likely in the trial court, but yes, I would agree with

16

Your Honor on that.

17

QUESTION: Mr. Poor, I'm still looking for that

18

case that you cited, because at least the two cases that

19

you relied on principally, Taylor and Carlisle, those were

20

both cases where the untimeliness point was timely raised.

21

MR. POOR: That is true, Your Honor, both in

22

Taylor and Carlisle it was raised, but I would suggest

23

that in Taylor, if the Court did not allow a late

24

extension based upon a bad faith claim of exemption -

25

QUESTION: Well, the rule says good faith isn't

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

an excuse, so -

2

MR. POOR: And -

3

QUESTION: But - but you are arguing that an

4

untimely raising of the lack of timeliness is okay, and

5

neither Carlisle nor Taylor stand for that proposition.

6

MR. POOR: Well, they do in a broader sense, Your

7

Honors, that they do not - I would submit that they do not

8

allow any kind of equitable QUESTION: They were both cases where the

9
10

objection to the untimeliness was timely made, right?

11

MR. POOR: That's correct.

12

QUESTION: So then they could not have considered

13

the case such as this one where the objection is untimely

14

made?

15

MR. POOR: And that - what that gets - what that

16

gets back to our point in our brief that in the Santos

17

case that the Seventh Circuit relied upon most heavily

18

here, they did what I would call a pick and choose of

19

different type of equitable exceptions.

20
21

In -

QUESTION: I didn't think that forfeiture was an
equitable exception.

22

MR. POOR: Well, in -

23

QUESTION: There is a difference between waiver,

24

which is a conscious act, and forfeiture, which is rule

25

that says, if you don't raise the point, which is the

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ordinary consequence of not raising a defense, if you

2

don't raise it and the time to amend passes and you have a

3

judgment on the merits, you can't go back to square one

4

and said, oh, sorry, I should have put it in my answer,

5

but -

6

MR. POOR: Well, our - our biggest point here,

7

Your Honor, is that either these rules set time limits

8

that cannot be altered by any type of equitable doctrine,

9

be it forfeiture, waiver, or equitable estoppel, I mean,

10
11
12
13

either all of those are in or QUESTION: I didn't think that forfeiture was an
equitable doctrine.
MR. POOR: Well, I - I guess in this case we've

14

always talked about waiver as - as what we're talking

15

about here in terms of - it was an implied waiver in terms

16

of - it was inaction - inaction by the debtor -

17

QUESTION: Well, you're - you're talking about

18

the same thing as implied exceptions to the statute of

19

limitations that, you know, the statute may have run but

20

there are certain exceptions where the thing will still be

21

considered.

22

MR. POOR: That's - that's correct, Your Honor.

23

If - a tolling type, and I think that's what we're getting

24

at here is are there tolling-type exceptions to this

25

language and I come back - we come back to the point that

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

if this rule was designed by the rulemakers to track the

2

language of 6(b) and not allow any type of exception,

3

whether it's equitable tolling or - or whatever, then

4

either - either all those exceptions come in or they - or

5

they don't, because -

6

QUESTION: But - but you cite only - in response

7

to Justice Breyer, you cite only one 6(b) case that you're

8

aware of that applied the principle you're arguing for

9

here, namely that a late-raised objection will - will be

10
11

heard, right?
QUESTION: It isn't an exception.

The point is,

12

I think some of us have been pointing out to you, is our

13

belief, which you could try to disabuse us of, that this

14

has nothing to do with exceptions.

15

no exceptions no matter what, but there can be a rule of

16

law that you win and there are no exceptions, but still,

17

because you didn't raise the point, you lose it.

18

nothing to do with exceptions.

19

normal rule, in a court you have to raise a point.

20

that's what I'm interested in.

We'll assume there are

That has

It has to do with the
Now

21

MR. POOR: And -

22

QUESTION: And that's what I wonder - I'm asking

23

because Rule 6, I think, would be analogous to that and so

24

if you - there are some cases -

25

MR. POOR: And I would - the Hulson case is an

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

excellent example.
QUESTION: Which case?

2
3

it in your brief.
MR. POOR: No, it's in the - the Kirsch - the

4
5

Because I'm looking for

Kirsch -

6

QUESTION: Cited by another case, right?

7

MR. POOR: That's correct.

8

QUESTION: It's cited in Kirsch?

9

MR. POOR: Yeah, but - and the - the other point

10

I would make, though, is that the - the overall concept

11

here is this case is really no different than the Carlisle

12

case in that if the claimant Carlisle, one day late, or

13

the - the motion one day late could not be extended

14

because of attorney error -

15

QUESTION: But Mr. Poor, it can't be like

16

Carlisle because the Government timely made that

17

objection.

18

MR. POOR: But the - the question, Your Honor, is

19

- I would come back to this: Could the Government waive

20

the - the objection deadline in 45(b)?

21

answer, and I think this is where this all comes together,

22

all of this comes together in this point, is that the

23

Government could not waive that 45(b) deadline, and that

24

45(b) deadline is the same as 6(b) and it's the -

25

And I think the

QUESTION: So you think that case stands for the

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

proposition that the Government had said nothing and the

2

court had said, I considered this, I grant the motion to

3

acquit, that the Government could then come in and say, oh

4

sorry, we forgot to tell you that this was one day late

5

and so you couldn't consider it.

6

MR. POOR: If there are - I would submit, Your

7

Honor, that if these - if these deadlines are such that

8

they may not be QUESTION: But the - the opinion of this Court

9
10

certainly doesn't give any basis for that - for such a

11

judgment.

12

MR. POOR: Well, it dealt with the idea it was

13

their inherent power to do that, but if - if the Court

14

allows a rule that says the Government can waive this or

15

the Government can - if the Government can stipulate to

16

it, which is, in effect, a waiver-type argument, then I

17

think that that pretty much unravels Carlisle.

18

Government is able to stipulate to a late - a late time

19

period by either action or inaction, then I think that

20

unravels Carlisle and all these 6(b) family of cases.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2
3

MR. FIGLIULO:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The best way for me to understand this case is

4
5

just to walk through the case.

This is a - an adversary

6

proceeding.

7

complaint objecting to discharge, and that specifically is

8

provided as an adversary proceeding.

9

the realm or the arena of an adversary proceeding, the

Rule 4004 deals with the time for filing a

Once we move into

10

rules are pretty clear.

If - if the complaint is late,

11

the plaintiff runs the risk of losing his case if the

12

defense is timely raised, but there's obligations that

13

shift to the defendant once we're in the adversary

14

proceeding.

The defendant has to answer -

QUESTION: Mr. Figliulo, do you know of any case

15
16

in which an objection could be waived and yet prior to the

17

time of waiver, the parties could not, by stipulation,

18

eliminate the objection?
MR. FIGLIULO: There's a - a bankruptcy case that

19
20

holds that, but I don't think - I don't think that's

21

right.

I think the -

22

QUESTION: Well -

23

MR. FIGLIULO:

24

QUESTION: - that - that holds what?

25

I think you can't agree You - you

think - you think the parties can waive the limitation of

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

- of 4004?

2

MR. FIGLIULO: I believe they can, yes.

3

QUESTION: The parties, if they get together, can

4

waive it?

5

MR. FIGLIULO: Yes, I - I believe they can.

6

QUESTION: All right.

7

MR. FIGLIULO: And I think - I think -

8

QUESTION: I have trouble - I have trouble with

9

that.

10

MR. FIGLIULO: Here - here's - here's -

11

QUESTION: I can't imagine that - that you're

12

unable to, by stipulation, agree to eliminate it, but you

13

can - one of the parties can nonetheless waive it.

14

that'd be a very unusual MR. FIGLIULO: I think the statute of limitations

15
16

That ­

is a personal defense and -

17

QUESTION: It can be waived.

18

MR. FIGLIULO: - therefore, it can be waived, and

19

there's tolling agreements that are entered into regularly

20

-

21

QUESTION: Exactly.

22

MR. FIGLIULO: - with respect to statute of

23

limitations -

24

QUESTION: Right.

25

MR. FIGLIULO: - and I think it could apply to

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

4004(a) as well.
QUESTION: So you think the what's his case is

2
3

wrong - what was the name of the one that MR. FIGLIULO: I think it was Barley, In re

4
5

Barley, Your Honor.

I think that case said that the

6

stipulation was not QUESTION: And was that a case in which the - in

7
8

which the court expressly addressed the issue and say -

9

and said, I'm not going to allow - I'm not going to permit

10

the extension of time?

11

MR. FIGLIULO: I think that was.

12

QUESTION: That - that's - that's far different

13

than just a waiver.

14

MR. FIGLIULO: I do understand.

15

QUESTION: There the judges said, you're - we're

16

not going to allow you to delay the processes of this

17

court, and that's quite different than parties simply

18

doing it on their own without the judges' intervention.
MR. FIGLIULO: I agree, Your Honor, and the rule,

19
20

like Rule 6(b) or 9000(6)(b) focuses on motions for

21

extension and enlargement and it is strict and it does

22

provide the guidelines for the court to follow, but I -

23

QUESTION: I - I'm not sure what you're saying

24
25

now.

You MR. FIGLIULO: Well -

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: - you think in Barley, when the

2

parties signed an agreement to extend the time limit, the

3

court should have accepted?

4

MR. FIGLIULO: I believe that, yes.

5

QUESTION: Okay.

6

MR. FIGLIULO: But I think the court - the reason

7

in the court, as I understood it, was that they could not

8

agree to do that because extensions and enlargement of

9

time is governed by the rule and that it wasn't permitted

10

by the rule.

11

situation where we have a limitations period that's the -

12

But in this case I think we have a classic

it should have been raised in the answer.

It was not

13

raised in the answer.

14

court granted summary judgment.

15

an implied waiver of a limitations defense and the court

16

recognized that at the bankruptcy level, it's been

17

recognized that way at the district court level, it's been

18

recognized that way by the Seventh Circuit, and it's a, I

19

think, 100 percent right.

20

It wasn't raised until after the
That's a classic case of

It's also directly in accord with the background

21

principles of waiver that apply to a civil-type action.

22

QUESTION: Would you agree - do you agree with

23

the Government that if the statute in question, not the

24

bankruptcy rule, but at 157(b)(2)(J), if that required

25

timely objection as some other statutes in the bankruptcy

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

realm do, then you would lose, if the statute rather than

2

the rule required timely objection?

3
4

MR. FIGLIULO: I think if the statute provided if Section 157 provided timely, like it does for

5

abstention, I think that would make the rules more of an

6

exercise of the code and perhaps a stronger basis for

7

arguing the mandatory strictness of the rules.

8

think it would make it jurisdictional.

9

I do not

QUESTION: Well, many - many statute of

10

limitations are, of course, enacted by the legislature

11

rather than by rule, and nonetheless you have tolling

12

there, do you not?

13

MR. FIGLIULO: Exactly, Your Honor.

In fact,

14

traditionally, and as this Court has recognized from time

15

to time, that statute of limitations, which are phrased in

16

mandatory terms, are silent with respect to whether

17

certain exceptions or defenses traditionally apply, but

18

regularly apply those, and that would apply particularly

19

here where the bankruptcy court is a court of equity, and

20

waiver is one of those principles.

21

QUESTION: In the typical case there's not a

22

whole bunch of people who are hanging on the resolution of

23

this issue.

24
25

I mean, what's involved here is, I mean, it -

it says no later than 60 days after the first date set
for meeting of creditors.

The problem is you have a whole

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

bunch of people who don't know what their rights are going

2

to be until this matter is settled and it - it seems to me

3

that it's - it's quite reasonable to insist upon

4

compliance with that time limit no matter what, because

5

there are other people's interests involved.

6

MR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, I don't quarrel with

7

the fact that the time limit is important and it serves a

8

valid purpose, but when we look at waiver - and we're not

9

talking about exceptions to extend time here, we're

10

looking at the defendant's obligation to - to assert a

11

timely objection to the untimeliness of the complaint.

12

That promotes finality because that brings the issue to a

13

head and it - it conserves judicial resources - it does

14

everything waivers should do.

15

QUESTION: But are you -

16

QUESTION: Except - except that it does not lead

17

to the conclusion that they should be able voluntarily to

18

agree to extend the time period, which - which is a

19

position you support?

20
21

MR. FIGLIULO: It's a position I support but it's
not critical to the -

22

QUESTION: Well -

23

MR. FIGLIULO: - position that we advocate, but I

24
25

do think it's right, because I do think QUESTION: Well, would you - would you agree that

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a district court could override that determination of the

2

parties, say I'm not going to allow the late filing?

3

Other - the rights of other persons are involved and the

4

district court in the hypothetical case says, I know this

5

is not jurisdictional but it is within my control.
MR. FIGLIULO: I think the - the bankruptcy court

6
7

level, that probably would be within the court's

8

discretion, but I - my view is that it's - it's like a

9

tolling agreement and it should be permitted, because a

10

statute of limitations or a limitations period is a

11

personal defense.

12

circumstances where the court refuses to enforce the

13

agreement, I can't conceive of why that would be

14

permitted.

Now, if there's extraordinary

QUESTION: Isn't the difference between the

15
16

statute of limitations and the case we've got here that in

17

the statute of limitations case we make the assumption

18

that the only two interested parties are the plaintiff and

19

the defendant, and if they don't care, why should anybody

20

else?

21

parties and there is a pretty well-articulated

22

governmental interest in wrapping this up quickly.

23

seems to me that in - in the bankruptcy case, the court

24

would have every reason, if it was brought to its

25

attention, e.g., in the form of a stipulation, to say, no,

In this case, however, there are other interested

So it

1

I'm going to keep the ball rolling fast.

2

distinction?

Isn't that the

MR. FIGLIULO: Your Honor, I think that's a sound

3
4

distinction.

I - I happen to believe that

5

dischargeability is a complaint for objecting to

6

dischargeability primarily affects the objecting party and

7

the debtor, and while there may be other rights of people

8

implicated, it's still very personal with respect to the

9

debtor and the creditor who's making the objection to

10

discharge.

11

respect to dischargeability of particular debts as in

12

4007.

13

And that would also be even more true with

So I understand the policy consideration, there

14

is a distinction there.

I - I've probably bitten off more

15

than I should have with respect to whether that can be

16

agreed on or not -

17

QUESTION: You don't have to maintain that.

18

(Laughter.)

19

QUESTION: Why don't you recognize that -

20

MR. FIGLIULO: But I do -

21

QUESTION: - that this is simply - the question

22

is essentially, where does one draw the line?

And one

23

might say, even if the objection to the timeliness isn't

24

raised in the initial answer, it could be raised in an

25

amendment to the answer.

It could even be raised in

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

opposition to the summary judgment motion.

But there

2

comes a point where it's too late to make that objection,

3

and that's essentially the question for us: Where do you

4

draw the line when it's too late?

5

appeal, it could be after adjudication on the merits in

6

the trial court.

7

the line about raising this objection, what is your

8

position?

Now, it could be on

So on that question of where do we draw

MR. FIGLIULO: I know that in this case, once -

9
10

once the court adjudicates the merits, it is waived, it's

11

over, it's too late.

QUESTION: And that's all you have to maintain to

12
13

I would -

prevail here?
MR. FIGLIULO: I do believe - I do believe that

14
15

whether there's been an implied waiver or a waiver has

16

some of a fact inquiry that's necessary.

17

early as the failure to raise it in the answer, but I do

18

recognize the liberal rules of amendment to answers and

19

that may be permitted it by the court in its discretion,

20

so it's not a bright line before judgment, it's not bright

21

line where you draw the line, in my judgement, but in -

22

and certainly once the court rules, it's too late.

It can be as

Is

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

which is what triggers the - the time limit here, is -

2

does that date often fluctuate the - the order of the

3

first meeting of creditor and then they'll - and then

4

they'll change it?
MR. FIGLIULO: No, that - it's pretty set, Your

8

a relatively fixed point in time from which these

it is a little odd that it was never argued that, well,

14

attorney thinking, I mean, I don't see that it affects

15

your client one way or the other, but, I mean, obviously

16

the Solicitor General in this case has suggested an

17

affirmance on the very narrow ground that maybe they're

18

quite right about what the rule should be interpreted, but

19

still they lost the chance to raise the rule because they

20

didn't raise it.

21

On the other hand, the split in the circuits is more on

22

the broader question of how absolute are these rules in -

23

how absolute are the deadlines in this particular rule,

All right, that's a very narrow ground.

24

and that's a broader question, which is also a possible

25

ground for affirmance, so either way your client would

But, as a bankruptcy lawyer, what's your opinion?
MR. FIGLIULO: My - and I approach this with

2
3

little trepidation, but I believe equitable exceptions,

4

the traditional equitable exceptions of tolling and

5

equitable estoppel, continue to apply and should apply to

6

Rule 4004(a) and 4007.

7

expressly abrogated.

I don't think they've been

I think they're such a powerful part

QUESTION: A problem then about the other part

10

that says you can't extend the deadlines in this main part

11

except for the reasons that are there given, which is good

12

cause, et cetera, what do we do about that?

13

MR. FIGLIULO: I - I think the - the - Rule

16

don't think it eliminates equitable tolling.

17

different.

18

some cases, and to the extent it's excusable neglect, it's

19

not grounds for extension, but a - a true tolling -

20

I think it's

I think tolling and excusable neglect overlap

QUESTION: What would be a cause for tolling if

21

excusable neglect is out of it?

22

rule is saying there are no exceptions, period, and to say

23

that even if you can show good cause you don't get it

24

extended, but there's some other equitable.

25

It seems to me that this

MR. FIGLIULO: I - it's a relatively - I think

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

equitable tolling, in the context of this rule, is

relatively narrow exception, it's not - it's little

broader than the unique circumstances that relate to if a

party's misled by a rule of court.

can - there can be circumstances, for example, if a

client's lawyer dies right before the deadline is -

QUESTION: Why isn't that excusable neglect?

MR. FIGLIULO: I don't think it's neglect.

I - I

10

think there's equitable tolling and - and that - that's

why I do think it survives in some way, but I - it's not

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

23

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENT

I

MR. JONES: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I have very little to add to what's already been

2

said because basically what's been said by respondent is

3

our view as well, which is that this is a question of

4

waiver, not a question of enlargement or extension of the

5

time to file a timely complaint, and the one thing I do

6

want to add, though, is that the court of appeals, it

7

seems to us, correctly pointed out that there is a rules-

8

based answer to the waiver question as well as the general

9

principles that we have articulated.
The rules-based answer is alluded to by

10
11

respondent, which is the Rule 4004(d) expressly

12

incorporates through Part 7 of the bankruptcy code the

13

pleading requirements of 8(c) of the Federal Rules of

14

Civil Procedure.

15

16

answer or they would be treated as waived.

was subject to waiver when it was not raised in the

answer.

20

discretion to determine that when it's not raised until

21

after the trial, or in this case after summary judgment

22

was entered, it's plainly too late, and it was waived.

23

QUESTION: Mr. Jones, when - at what point in

Now, that means that the - the debtor

This was an

We think the court was right in exercising its

24

that spectrum would it have been tiled permissible to

25

allow it?

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. JONES: The broad answer to that question -

2

well, the first answer is, that's not been raised.

3

They've - they've suggested it can't be waived, not that

4

the court abused its discretion.

5

question, though, is that it's - if it would not be too

6

late to amend the answer, then it's not forfeited or

7

waived.
QUESTION: Well, when is it too late to amend the

8
9
10

The answer to your

answer?
MR. JONES: That's - there's a - a whole body of

11

precedent about that, and as respondent correctly says,

12

it's clearly too late once the judgment has been

13

determined.

14
15
16
17
18

If -

QUESTION: Now wait, do you mean judgment is - is
determined, or judgment is entered?
MR. JONES: In this case judgment was announced
after the trial.

I - let me back up.

I think that it's -

the court retains discretion to allow an amendment up to

19

the pre-trial stage.

20

court sometimes allows complaints to be amended in its

21

discretion, and -

22
23
24
25

Up to the pre-trial answer, the

QUESTION: Well, quite frequently, does it not,
at pre-trial?
MR. JONES: Not infrequently, but it's also the
case that sometimes amendments are denied at that point

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because of the particularity, facts of the case.

But my

2

point is simply, at this stage of the case it's clearly

3

have been waived and - and QUESTION: Well, now, at this stage of the case,

4
5

judgment had not yet been entered, but the motion for

6

summary judgment had been granted.

7

it can never be done at that stage?
MR. JONES: It would be - I - I think that it -

8
9

You - are you saying

it might be not an abusive direction - there's a lot of

10

nots there.

A court might be able to exercise discretion

11

if it thought in the circumstances it was appropriate, but

12

it is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial

13

court, and certainly at that stage it was well within its

14

discretion, and again, that issue hasn't been presented or

15

raised.

16

and the reason that it was raised in that fashion is they

17

said it's jurisdictional.

18

conceded, both in their reply brief and in - and in court

19

today, that it doesn't affect the subject matter

20

jurisdiction of the court.

What was raised is the idea you can't waive it,

But it's - but they've

And the cases are clear that -

21
22

QUESTION: How do you - how do you reconcile your

23

view about the court having such broad discretion with -

24

with the wording of 4004(b), which says that on motion,

25

the court may for cause extend the time, but the motion

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

shall be filed before the time has expired?

2

you're saying is, well, it really doesn't matter, the

3

court has discretion to go ahead even though the motion

4

wasn't filed before the time has expired.

5

And what

MR. JONES: I'm sorry, Justice Scalia.

The

6

question that I was answering was whether the court had

7

discretion to accept the late-raised objection to the late

8

complaint.

9
10

QUESTION: I'm sorry.
MR. JONES: And that's a different - and I do

11

think the court has that discretion.

12

would have had discretion to allow a late complaint at

13

that - at some later point really isn't before the Court,

14

because they haven't claimed that there is any equitable

15

grounds for enlarging or extending the deadline, so that

16

question isn't presented.

17
18

Whether it had -

QUESTION: I don't - you're distinguishing
between granting - I'm sorry - granting -

19

MR. JONES: The -

20

QUESTION: - granting a late-raised objection and

21

granting a late-filed complaint?

22

MR. JONES: Correct.

23

QUESTION: Okay.

24

MR. JONES: Under ordinary principles of 8(c) and

25

the Rules of Federal Procedure which are applicable here.

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

My point is that a court could allow the late-raised

2

defense that it - that the complaint was untimely, up to

3

some point it would have discretion to do that, but it

4

exercised its discretion not to allow that late-raised

5

objection, late-raised defense in this case.

6

QUESTION: Well, the rule on amendment, which the

7

pleading rules, the Federal rules would apply, says that

8

it should be - if after you miss the time limit in which

9

you are allowed to amend as a matter of right, then you

10

may amend - and with the court's permission, and leave

11

shall be freely given when justice so requires.

12

MR. JONES: That's the discretionary standard and

13

I don't - I will be frank, I do not know if there's a case

14

that says that discretion stops at this point.

15

before the Court.

16

exercise such discretion after it had already determined

17

that the judgment should be awarded to one of the parties.

18

That's all I was trying to say.

19
20

That's not

It would just be odd for the Court to

QUESTION: At the outset you said there's a textbased or a rule-based -

MR. JONES: Rule-based.

22

23

MR. JONES: 4004(b).

25

2

MR. JONES: It's at -

3

QUESTION: Was that in - did you make that

4

argument in your brief?
MR. JONES: We did not make that argument.

5

The

respondent made the argument and the court of appeals made

7

the point.

8

respondent's brief.

9

says that the - the procedures of Part 7 will have

That provision is quoted in footnote 3 of
It's a very short provision.

It just

10

governed, and then Rule 7008 says that incorporates Rule

11

8(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
Now, we have not addressed the question of

12
13

whether equitable exceptions would be available under this

14

rule, but we do think that the Court's decision in the

15

Santos case provides a sensible explanation of how to

16

address that question.

17

point that the rules appear to say you cannot extend by

18

excusable neglect, but that doesn't preclude equitable

19

estoppel, because estoppel is based on the misconduct of

20

the debtor, excusable neglect is the neglect of the

21

creditor.

22

doesn't preclude allowing an extension for estoppel.

23

In Santos, the Court made the

different issue and it's a much broader issue and more

MR. JONES: This is a much - this is -

QUESTION: And you think, in other words, if they

3

had come in and said, hey, we - I've been taking all the

4

money out of wife's account, putting - put it in - you

5

know, I put it all in her name, ha ha ha, and I had hired

6

people to prevent the creditor from ever finding out, that

7

then the correct defense there would be equitable

8

estoppel, which is an enlargement of the time period?

9
10
11
12
13
14

MR. JONES: If the - if I understood your
hypothetical, if the basis of the estoppel was that QUESTION: I'm - I'm assuming they acted very
inequitably.
MR. JONES: - that we were unable to find - they
hid from us what they were doing -

15

QUESTION: Yes, yes.

16

MR. JONES: - yes, I think that would apply.

17

I should also point out that in that specific factual

18

scenario, 727(d) of the bankruptcy code would allow the

19

discharge to be reopened in -

20

But

QUESTION: You see, that - that's the argument

21

the other way.

22

really need to import these defenses into the rule itself

23

because there are other ways in the bankruptcy law that an

24

unfair kind of conduct that can be dealt with.

25

The argument the other way is you don't

MR. JONES: If, to the extent that there are

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

other ways to deal with it, then equity doesn't need to

2

step in if there's an adequate legal remedy.

3

when there's not an adequate answer in the code to this -

4

to whatever facts come up about the estoppel situation,

5

we would think that the rules don't preclude the court -

But if -

QUESTION: Mr. Kent, as I remember the - this

had done.

QUESTION: - but I continued to deposit my salary

QUESTION: It's a hypothetical case.

I'm trying

16

to get to the issue the - that's bothering me.

Can you

17

just give me one word about whether my belief about the

18

Rule 6 - it refers to a new trial motion in a civil case,

19

motion to amend the opinion, JNOV, all those time limits

20

it says are absolute.

21

or isn't at least normally held that a lawyer can sit

22

there, notice that the time limits weren't complied with,

23

wait to see if he wins, and then if he loses, bring it up

24

for the first time on appeal.

25

Because they're saying, no, I'm not right about it.

Now, I take it it's never been held

Am I right about that?

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

MR. JONES: Well, I - I think you're right about

2

that that you can waive an argument of any - based on

3

those rules in - in the trial court, but let me -

4

QUESTION: Is it - do you know of any case, Mr.

5

Kent, because those are all motions that are brought after

6

the trial, after the adjudication, and I can't imagine a

7

scenario where a lawyer who won would then - and the other

8

party moves for a new trial - would then say nothing.

9

MR. JONES: I'm not familiar with a case of that

10

type, but there - I can imagine that there's a case out

11

there that says something along the following, that this

12

Court's jurisdiction, by statute, is based on the

13

requirement, for example, that there be a notice of appeal

19

MR. POOR: I'd like to return to the - the

20

fundamental point is when these were adopted, 9006(b) was

21

patterned after 6(b), and that identical language, as this

22

Court instructed in the Robinson case, should be read to

23

be mandatory and jurisdictional, that is, not waiveable.

24

And if we look at a case like Santos, there's nothing in

25

the language that allows Santos to pick and choose between

6

there is through the - a policy argument that says, we

on the other hand, yeah, for policy reasons, we - we

should allow waiver to apply.

The only possible way you

And if you allow waiver, whether it is waiver in

the implied sense of inaction or waiver in the express
