ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS J. MILLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. MILLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The modern guilty plea colloquy, by focusing on

11

and clearly articulating the consequences of pleading

12

guilty, paralleling the Patterson case, clearly constitute

13

the -- the intelligent and knowing waiver of counsel in

14

this particular context.

15

context, among other things, the defendant is told the

16

elements of the crime, the range of the sentence, the

17

factual bases developed between the judge and the

18

defendant to assure that his guilt, and in addition,

19

the --

20

QUESTION:

In the modern guilty plea

Well, if someone is going to plead

21

guilty, I guess the question may boil down to whether he

22

has a right to be told the he could be represented by an

23

attorney in making the decision to plead and that it might

24

be useful to him to have an attorney's advice in making

25

that decision.

1

MR. MILLER:

2

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

You know, we --

It's a guilty plea.

It wasn't a

3

going to trial and he was told certainly of all the things

4

that could be involved in a trial and how an attorney

5

would be helpful but was not told, I guess, expressly that

6

if you plead guilty, you can be represented by counsel and

7

the attorney might give you useful advice.

8
9

MR. MILLER:

Separating the -- the two issues,

first, the question of whether he was explicitly told in

10

this proceeding that he had a right to counsel at this

11

proceeding.

12

know, there's -- there's a presumption of regularity here

13

based on the Johnson case.

14

He was not told in that many words.

QUESTION:

My goodness, he wasn't told.

But, you

You're

15

conceding that he wasn't told he had a right at the plea

16

stage.

17

was, Mr. Tovar, you're without counsel.

18

application for a court-appointed attorney.

19

represent yourself at today's hearing.

20

the State was saying is that that's sufficient.

I thought what they said to him right off the bat
I see you waived
You want to

So what I thought

21

MR. MILLER:

22

QUESTION:

23

issue in this case.

24

didn't see it in the response to the petition.

25

would be an issue for the lower court.

Yes.

And I didn't even think that was an
I didn't see it in the petition.

I

Maybe it

So I'm not sure

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what to do with that.

2

you want to concede it, that's fine with me.

3

MR. MILLER:

I can see it's ambiguous, but if

What -- what I'm saying, Your

4

Honor, is -- is this, that in -- in the total context, he

5

clearly knew that he had a right to counsel and, indeed,

6

that really is the -- the words that submit that --

7

QUESTION:

I mean, nobody is really -- at least,

8

is that an issue in front of us?

9

MR. MILLER:

10

You know, I -- I don't -- I don't

think -- I don't think it should be, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION:

I thought it was very much the issue

12

before the Iowa Supreme Court because that court said what

13

was missing here was information about the utility of a

14

lawyer at the plea stage before you enter the plea with

15

you at that hearing.

16

relate to what you're giving up by pleading guilty and not

17

going to trial.

18

And here, all of the statements made

Now, I thought, as Justice Breyer did, from that

19

opening colloquy there was information to the defendant

20

that he could consult with a lawyer before entering the

21

plea.

22

signed.

23

plea hearing, but that form is nowhere in the record or

24

the lodging.

25

And I wondered particularly about the form that he
Tovar signed a form waiving counsel before the

Does it exist?

MR. MILLER:

Your -- Your Honor, I -- I don't

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

think he actually signed a form.

2

is that he was informed at the -- informed at the arrest

3

through the Miranda warnings that he had a right to

4

counsel.

5

this is -- this is the part that -- that I think we focus

6

on.

7

What -- what did happen

And then he went for a initial appearance, and

At the initial appearance, the judge marked the

8

form saying application for court-appointed counsel, and

9

then wrote waived.

In other words, he had given the

10

opportunity at this initial appearance for counsel.

11

forward, there -- there was no reason to -- to interrupt

12

the initial appearance and having to have counsel at -- at

13

initial appearance.

14

Going

It was going forward.

And then the words that Justice Breyer referred

15

to, when he went to -- went to the plea hearing, the judge

16

said, you know, I see that you've -- you've waived

17

counsel, and then he says I assume that you want to

18

proceed to represent yourself.

19
20
21
22
23

So we think that -- that that really satisfies
the requirement -QUESTION:

But do we have the transcript of the

-- of that initial hearing where he waived counsel?
MR. MILLER:

The initial hearing -- the

24

checklist is in -- is in the documents that -- that were

25

given -- given to this Court.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, that wasn't the basis.

I -- I

2

didn't understand that to be the basis of our decision

3

here.

4

on whether he was advised at -- about how useful counsel

5

could be --

The -- the Supreme Court of Iowa did, indeed, focus

6

MR. MILLER:

7

QUESTION:

8
9
10

Yes, Your Honor, that --

-- in -- in connection with the

guilty plea -MR. MILLER:
QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

That's --

-- not that he wasn't advised that he

11

had a right to counsel.

12

he had a right to counsel, but it wasn't said, boy, you

13

know, you'd really be stupid to turn it down.

14

that wasn't done.

15

The problem here is he was told

That --

Right?

MR. MILLER:

That -- that's exactly right.

16

That's what the Iowa Supreme Court held.

17

wasn't -- it wasn't raised at the district court level.

18

It wasn't raised in the opposition to the cert petition.

19

QUESTION:

You know, it

So what is your -- what everybody I

20

think is trying to do is ask you what is your argument on

21

the point that we thought was why we granted the case, or

22

at least I thought why.

23

MR. MILLER:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes.

What -- what is the reason that the

Iowa court is wrong --

1

MR. MILLER:

2

QUESTION:

3
4

Yes.

-- on -- on the point just as Justice

Scalia put it?
MR. MILLER:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think -- I

5

think the -- the point is this, that in the plea setting

6

it is very analogous to the Patterson setting and not

7

analogous to the Faretta setting at -- at going to trial

8

without counsel.

9

Honor, that going through the plea and hearing the

And -- and the reason for that is, Your

10

elements and going through the factual basis and knowing

11

the punishments, that's something a person can comprehend

12

and can make a decision on, just like the Court held in

13

Patterson that the decision to answer a question under

14

interrogation or not under interrogation is something

15

someone could do.

16

But in -- in the trial setting, it is just so

17

difficult for a person to represent himself in terms of

18

the rule of evidence, in terms of strategy, witnesses,

19

choosing the jury.

20

is just so difficult.

21

inform the defendant of all those difficulties and by

22

informing him as -- with a -- with an authority figure

23

like a judge, we're -- we're pushing him towards counsel.

24
25

QUESTION:

Those are the kinds of things that it
What we do is two things.

We

Well, but -- but in -- in the context

of entering a plea, it certainly would be useful for the

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

defendant to know that if he had an attorney, the attorney

2

might take a look at -- at the sobriety tests.

3

talk with the prosecutor about a plea to the lesser

4

charge, reckless driving.

He might talk to the judge

5

about a reduced sentence.

It didn't happen here because

6

he got the minimum.

He might

7

But just as -- as a general matter, your brief

8

seems to suggest that there's -- there's not really much

9

role for the attorney at -- in entering a guilty plea.

I

10

-- I suggest that there -- there's a very important role

11

for him.

12

MR. MILLER:

Well, Your Honor, I think -- I

13

think there are a number of useful -- useful functions,

14

the ones you described, also collateral consequences.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MILLER:

And collateral consequences, yes.
But --

but generally in exercising

17

these rights and describing these rights, you give the

18

general -- the general right, not -- not the specific

19

services.

20

the Patterson setting, the -- you know, the things that a

21

lawyer could do about strategy on the questions or make

22

sure that you weren't tripped up on the questions, that

23

was not required by Patterson.

24

consequences.

25

requires and that this requires.

The -- the Ruiz case indicates that.

And in

It's the -- it's the main

It's the direct consequences that Patterson

1

And, Your Honor, if we go into all the useful

2

things that an attorney can do -- and -- and certainly

3

there are many -- then it's -- it's almost an endless

4

list.

5

up the -- the colloquy.

6

colloquy.

7

It's a fairly long list.

QUESTION:

And then we're cluttering

It's already a -- a rather long

This -- this comes after, I take it,

8

General Miller, the discussion between the judge and the

9

defendant as to whether or not the elements of the offense

10
11

are present?
MR. MILLER:

It would -- it would have -- I

12

guess it would have to come after that.

13

-- I think the factual basis is really the key here.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. MILLER:

16
17

I mean, I think

Yes.
The -- because that's -- that's the

-- that's our -- that's our real assurance that guilty -QUESTION:

Well, and if -- if the defendant

18

represents to the court that the factual basis for the

19

plea is there, that he committed the offense charged, why

20

is there any great interest in trying to persuade him not

21

to do that?

22

MR. MILLER:

You know, I -- I don't think there

23

is a great interest, Your Honor, and I don't -- I don't

24

think -- I don't think the -- the system is served here

25

particularly what -- what the Iowa Supreme Court required

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that, you know, a -- and a lawyer can give you an

2

independent assessment of -- of whether it's wise to plead

3

guilty.

4

about lawyers.

Obviously, that's something that -- that we know

5

And also really subsumed in that, to some

6

extent, is the -- the question of defenses, but it's not a

7

-- it's not a particularly helpful litany that they

8

developed.

9

QUESTION:

I --

10

QUESTION:

Well, the Iowa court made rather a

11

long laundry list of requirements.

12

have to go along with all of those things, but I am

13

interested to know whether you think there is a baseline

14

requirement that the court advise the defendant in making

15

a plea that he has a right to counsel and the attorney

16

could be helpful in making that decision.

17

MR. MILLER:

I suppose you wouldn't

Well, I -- I think that -- that he

18

has to know that he has -- has the right -- right to

19

counsel.

20
21
22
23
24
25

But -QUESTION:

You don't think he has to know that

counsel would be helpful.
MR. MILLER:

The -- he knows that counsel is --

would be helpful.
QUESTION:

He doesn't have to be told that

counsel would be helpful.

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MILLER:

He doesn't have to be told.

An

2

individual knows that -- that -- it certainly follows much

3

like in Patterson -- knows that the counsel would advise

4

him whether to ask -- answer the questions or not.

5

that's something someone --

6

QUESTION:

But

But you do agree that he's -- you do

7

agree that the advice should include explicit advice that

8

he has a right to counsel at the plea hearing.

9
10
11

MR. MILLER:

He should -- he should know at the

plea hearing that he had a right to counsel.
QUESTION:

But he doesn't have to be told by the

12

judge that he has a right to counsel at the -- he was not

13

-- this -- in this case he was not told by the judge he

14

had a right to counsel at that hearing.

15

MR. MILLER:

The -- the judge said, you know, I

16

-- I see you -- you made application, which would have

17

been for this hearing, for -- you -- you did not make

18

application --

19

QUESTION:

Well, why -- why is it clear that it

20

would be for this hearing because the judge followed up,

21

after saying that, did you want to represent yourself at

22

today's hearing, which would seem to me to imply that the

23

judge did not know whether or not he had already decided

24

not to have counsel at that hearing?

25

MR. MILLER:

Well, I think that question was

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

really did you change your mind.

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. MILLER:

I mean --

Well, of course --- you made -- you made a decision

4

at the initial hearing going forward towards this hearing

5

that you wouldn't have counsel.

6

mind?

7

QUESTION:

Have you changed your

Maybe -- maybe you -- you should say

8

that he should be advised of his right to counsel, but if

9

he isn't, it is a harmless mistake if it is clear from the

10

record that he knew it.

11

MR. MILLER:

12

QUESTION:

That -- that certainly would --

Even -- even if there is a -- a -- an

13

absolute right to have the judge tell you you're entitled

14

to counsel, if it's clear on the record at least that you

15

were told, there's -- there's no foul.

16

MR. MILLER:

17

QUESTION:

But it's not clear on this record,

19

QUESTION:

But that you knew.

20

MR. MILLER:

18

Yes, Your Honor.

though.

Yes.

You know, I -- I think it is.

21

You know, this -- every -- every presumption is -- is in

22

our favor in this kind of collateral setting.

23

QUESTION:

Well, if you draw -- draw

24

presumptions, maybe it is.

25

regular.

You presume everything was

Why sure, then it is.

But if you just look at

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what was said to him at the hearing itself, it's not clear

2

that he knew that he had -- he had waived application for

3

a court-appointed attorney.

4

wanted to represent himself.

5

MR. MILLER:

He didn't necessarily say he

Well, I -- I think, Your Honor, in

6

-- in the context of the discussion at the initial

7

appearance and then drawing that towards the -- forward

8

into the -- the plea -- plea hearing, that -- and -- and

9

certainly indulging the -- the presumptions here, that --

10

that that -- that he did know.

11

he's not asserted that he didn't know.

12

QUESTION:

And indeed, to this date

Well, but the -- all I'm saying is

13

the record doesn't establish it, and we've been -- in some

14

situations been rather meticulous about what ought to be

15

on the record because then you solve all the problems of

16

collateral attack if the record does disclose it rather

17

than relying on presumptions and inferences.

18

point.

MR. MILLER:

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Where did this case come out of?

22

operating without a --

23

Yes.

That's the

A

It was a misdemeanor, wasn't it, an OWI,

MR. MILLER:

It -- it was, Your Honor.

It would

24

be associate district court.

25

where there -- there would be a -- would be a judge and --

It would be a situation

1

who, you know, went through a -- you know, a long colloquy

2

with the -- with -- went through a colloquy concerning

3

representation.

4

QUESTION:

But that was basically the rule --

5

what would be in the Federal system, a rule 11 colloquy,

6

and it's all canned.

7

shows, he -- he went through the -- almost precisely the

8

same litany on both times.

9

I mean, the -- as the transcript

MR. MILLER:

So --

Yes, Your Honor.

It -- it

10

parallels rule 11.

11

similar to -- to rule 11.

12

hearing, of course, he was asked three times whether he

13

wanted to plea or whether he wanted to -- to go forward

14

and -- and contest the case and that's -- in that setting.

15

It's -- our rule 8 is -- is very

QUESTION:

And at the -- at the plea

He does have a right to counsel at

16

the plea hearing.

17

to consult with counsel before the hearing takes place,

18

but I -- I think your argument is he doesn't even have to

19

be told that bare information, never mind the -- the

20

continuing spiel about how much a lawyer would be worth to

21

him, but just the simple statement before you enter this

22

plea, you're entitled to consult a lawyer.

23

want a lawyer to be with you at the hearing, you're

24

entitled to that too.

25

MR. MILLER:

He does have a right if he asserts it

And if you

What -- what we're saying, Your

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

Honor, is that -- that that was covered by the -- the

2

words that Justice Breyer mentioned at -- at the outset,

3

that you know, I -- I see you waived application for

4

counsel at -- at the prior -- it would have been at the

5

prior proceedings, which would have been for this

6

proceeding, and do you -- you know, do you continue to

7

want to represent yourself.

8
9
10

QUESTION:

But I think there's something

important afterwards.

It's or did you want to take some

time to hire an attorney to represent you, which --

11

QUESTION:

That was at the sentencing.

12

QUESTION:

-- certainly one inference is that to

13

represent you at this kind of proceeding.

14
15

MR. MILLER:

Yes, yes, Your Honor.

The --

the --

16

QUESTION:

That -- that was not said at -- at

17

his plea hearing.

18

when he pled to another crime that he had committed in the

19

interim.

That was said at his sentencing hearing

20

But at -- the lines of what went on at the plea

21

hearing is I see, Mr. Tovar, you waived application for a

22

court-appointed attorney.

23

yourself at today's hearing?

24
25

MR. MILLER:

Did you want to represent
Period.

That was it.

That -- that was at -- at that

proceeding, and -- and we argue that that -- those are the

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- those are the key words that really -- really wrap up

2

this issue, that he was told before he had a right to

3

counsel at this hearing.

4

reaffirmed that he wanted to represent himself at -- at

5

the hearing.

6

There's a referral back.

It was

As I say, that -- that -- you know, it was not

7

raised by the -- by the defendant at the trial court level

8

or in the -- or in the resistance to the cert petition.

9

And to this day, they -- they've not asserted that he

10

didn't know that he had the right to counsel at the -- at

11

the plea -- at the plea hearing.

12

QUESTION:

The States seem to take various

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

8

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The plea colloquy conducted at respondent's 1996

12

prosecution adequately informed respondent of the dangers

13

and disadvantages of proceeding without counsel.

14

Respondent's waiver of counsel and the guilty plea itself

15

were therefore knowing and intelligent.

16

the Iowa Supreme Court should be reversed.

The judgment of

17

I think it may be helpful to look first at the

18

precise language that the Iowa Supreme Court employed in

19

announcing the warnings that it thought were

20

constitutionally required, and if the Court looks at page

21

18 of the appendix to the certiorari petition, that's the

22

paragraph of the Iowa Supreme Court's opinion that's

23

entitled Summary and Disposition.

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. STEWART:

And it --

Page 18 of what?
Of the appendix to the certiorari

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

petition.

2

And if you -- if you look in -- in the middle of

3

the page, the Iowa Supreme Court in summarizing its

4

holding said, rather, the trial judge need only advise the

5

defendant generally that there are defenses to criminal

6

charges that may not be known by lay persons and that the

7

danger in waiving of the assistance of counsel in deciding

8

whether to plead guilty is the risk that a viable defense

9

will be overlooked.

The defendant should be admonished

10

that by waiving his right to an attorney, he will lose the

11

opportunity to obtain an -- an opinion on whether under

12

the facts and applicable law it is wise to plead guilty.

13

In addition, the court must ensure the defendant

14

understands the nature of the charges against him and the

15

range of allowable punishments.

16

But the third paragraph is -- is more -- the

17

third sentence is more or less irrelevant because there's

18

no dispute here that the defendant was informed of the

19

nature and -- of the charge and the applicable

20

punishments, and that would be done in any standard plea

21

colloquy.

22

that are at issue, and I think there are some noteworthy

23

points about these.

24
25

So it's really just the previous two sentences

The first is that the warnings mandated by the
Iowa Supreme Court don't contain any declarative sentence

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to the effect that you have a right to represented by

2

counsel at this plea proceeding.

3

think took it as given that respondent had been made

4

adequately aware that he had a right to counsel and that

5

what was missing was adequate information about the

6

services that counsel could perform in connection with the

7

plea decision.

8
9

The Iowa Supreme Court I

The second thing is that there's no reference in
these warnings to case-specific issues such as possible

10

suppression of evidence or the potential for plea

11

bargaining.

12

warnings that could be given in every single case.

13

our view, the warnings are either vacuous or misleading,

14

depending on how they're interpreted.

15

The -- the warnings are designed to be
And in

If they are accurately interpreted as

16

generalizations about the criminal justice process, they

17

really say nothing more than that as a class lawyers know

18

more about the law than people who are not lawyers, and

19

it's at least possible that consulting with a lawyer would

20

improve your chances in this criminal prosecution.

21

think any defendant who is aware that he has the right to

22

counsel would be aware of those facts, would be aware of

23

at least the possibility that a lawyer could help him and

24

the certainty that a lawyer would know more about the

25

charges than he would.

And I

1

On the other hand, if the defendant

2

misunderstands these warnings as directed to him

3

personally as availed suggestion that there is actually a

4

meritorious defense in his own case, then the defendant

5

may be given an artificial disincentive to plead guilty

6

and in the case of a non-indigent defendant may be led to

7

spend his own funds consulting with a lawyer when in fact

8

no valid defense exists.

QUESTION:

Would a Miranda warning be sufficient

10

to advise the -- the defendant that you have a right to

counsel?

have a right to one at the plea bargain.

15

Period.

It's pretty obvious to me that if you

MR. STEWART:

Would that be

I think it would be

16

constitutionally sufficient, but it's certainly better

practice to make sure that the defendant understands that

to counsel extended beyond the initial questioning itself

2

and would continue for the duration of the proceedings.

3

And we'd also point out that because this is a

4

collateral challenge, the defendant bears the burden of

5

establishing that no knowing and intelligent waiver

6

occurred.

7

record on this point, I think the defendant is properly

8

chargeable with that.

9

And to the extent that there's a gap in the

I'd also like to return to the point that

10

Justice Kennedy made earlier about the possibility that in

11

some cases an attorney might be able to obtain suppression

12

of incriminating evidence or might be able to negotiate

13

with the prosecution about possible plea bargains.

14

think first it's noteworthy that the standard rule 11

15

colloquy mentions several constitutional rights that an

16

individual gives up by pleading guilty, but it doesn't

17

mention the possibility of suppressing evidence and it

18

doesn't mention the possibility of plea bargaining.

19

would be odd to think that you could have a

20

constitutionally valid waiver even though the defendant

21

was not informed of those substantive possibilities but

22

would, nevertheless, have to be informed of the assistance

23

that a lawyer might provide in connection with those --

25

QUESTION:

I

So it

Mr. Stewart, do you know what the

general practice is in Federal courts?

Are there

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

instructions given to prosecutors to make sure, for

2

example, that the defendant at a guilty plea is told that

3

maybe the -- that he has a right to a lawyer and he might

4

be helpful?

5

MR. STEWART:

Well, as to the -- it does --

6

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 in its current form

7

says that if the defendant appears at the plea hearing

8

without counsel, he is to be informed that he has a right

9

to counsel at trial and at every other stage of the

10

proceedings.

11

defendant be made aware that he has a right to counsel at

12

the plea hearing.

So there's clearly a requirement that the

13

Neither the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure

14

nor the bench book for U.S. district judges requires that

15

the defendant be given additional information about the

16

services that an attorney might provide or the likelihood

17

that an attorney could be helpful by --

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Do you know the practice in -- in

other States generally?
MR. STEWART:

My sense is that there is probably

21

a great deal of variation not only from State to State,

22

but among different courts within different States I

23

think, and I think that's probably the -- the likelihood

24

in the Federal system as well.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I suppose my comment was

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in response to the argument that, well, it really doesn't

2

make any difference, which is the -- the intimation I -- I

3

saw in -- in the brief.

4

difference because we assume that anybody knows this

5

stuff?

6

MR. STEWART:

And I suppose it doesn't make any

I don't think we would assume that

7

any -- necessarily any layperson would be aware of the

8

potential for suppressing evidence or the possibility of

9

negotiating a plea arrangement.

I think any defendant

10

knows more generally that lawyers have legal expertise

11

that lay people lack.

12

But I think if -- if we try to -- to think about

13

how warnings about suppression and plea bargaining might

14

work, I think we realize why the Iowa Supreme Court shied

15

away from something like that because, on the one hand, if

16

this Court instructed, as a matter of constitutional law,

17

that whenever an uncounseled person pleads guilty, he has

18

to be informed that in some cases it may be possible to

19

suppress incriminating evidence and in some cases it may

20

be possible to negotiate with the prosecution for a

21

reduced charge, a lot of defendants are going to be given

22

false hope because the possibility that those modes of

23

procedure might succeed would vary enormously.

24
25

QUESTION:

Why -- why wouldn't the same argument

apply to all of the rights that you're going to lose if

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you plead guilty?

2

largely unnecessary under your view?

3

Why -- why wouldn't rule 11 be really

MR. STEWART:

Well, I -- I think those rules

4

really do focus on things that will actually happen in any

5

criminal trial if the defendant decides not to plead

6

guilty.

7

guilty, you are waiving the right either to testify or not

8

testify on your own behalf.

9

counsel.

That is, the defendant is informed if you plead

You're giving up the right to

You're giving up the right to cross-examine

10

witnesses.

11

things that are likely to occur in virtually any criminal

12

trial, and I think that's -- that's the idea of a

13

standardized plea colloquy.

14

The defendant really is being told about

On -- on the other hand, if you're talking about

15

suppression of evidence or talking about plea bargaining,

16

if you give that advice in every case, it's often going to

17

be misleading.

18

the position of saying you might be able to bargain with

19

the prosecution over a reduced charge even though he knows

20

that the policy of the prosecutor is not to engage in plea

21

bargaining with respect to a category of cases that

22

includes that one.

23

A trial judge is going to find himself in

QUESTION:

Mr. Stewart, as I understand your

24

argument, you're -- you're arguing not only are these

25

warnings not constitutionally mandated, you're also saying

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they're probably unwise in a number of situations.

2

you arguing that they're so unwise that we should tell, as

3

a matter of Federal law, a State judge could not give

4

these warnings?

5

MR. STEWART:

Are

No, I don't think there would be

6

any Federal law barrier to States requiring warnings such

7

as these.

8

the warnings we regard as vacuous, that were mandated by

9

the Iowa Supreme Court are less likely to be harmful than

10

And I -- I think the -- the vacuous warnings,

more specific warnings about --

11

But the other point I wanted to make is if the

12

Court decided that it wouldn't be a good idea to warn

13

about suppression of evidence or plea bargaining in every

14

case but maybe it would be advisable to do that in some

15

cases, that would really be thrusting trial judges in an

16

untenable position because the point of having a

17

standardized plea colloquy is to give judges a -- a safe

18

harbor, to give them some assurance that if they provide

19

standardized advice in every case, that's going to be

20

enough.

21

likelihood of a successful plea negotiation sufficiently

22

great in this particular case that the defendant should be

23

advised about it or do I see a viable basis for asking for

24

suppression of evidence, it would really make the trial

25

judge's life much more difficult.

And if a trial judge had to decide is the

to hold, as a matter of constitutional law, that the trial

2

judge is required to do that and can be reversed for

failure to, it would really cause disruption.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THERESA R. WILSON

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8
9

MS. WILSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Before a court may accept a guilty plea from an

11

uncounseled defendant, the Constitution requires that the

12

defendant be advised of the following:

13

have counsel present prior to and during entry of the

14

guilty plea, including appointed counsel if necessary;

15

that by waiving counsel, he will lose an independent

16

opinion of his case and on the wisdom of pleading guilty;

17

and that by waiving counsel, he risks overlooking

18

potential defenses that he as a layperson may not

19

recognize.

that specific.

1

MS. WILSON:

Correct.

The Iowa Supreme Court

2

applied the rules of Patterson and Faretta, determining

3

that a uncounseled defendant who chooses to plead guilty

4

must be given a meaningful discussion regarding the

5

usefulness of counsel at the plea proceeding and the

6

dangers of proceeding pro se.

7

the best way to fulfill that obligation is to advise the

8

defendant of the risks of overlooking potential defenses

9

and of the loss of an independent opinion regarding his

The court determined that

case.
QUESTION:

My -- I guess the difficulty that I

12

have with that is no -- no question about the -- the

13

soundness of those general statements, but they are so

14

general that they -- they raise the question whether there

15

are really very many defendants that don't know that to

16

begin with and whether there is a real utility in

17

requiring those warnings and hence paying the price in the

18

mistaken cases when they're not given.

19

defendants really need this?

20

MS. WILSON:

Yes.

Do -- do

We simply cannot infer from

21

the fact that a defendant is told that he has counsel or

22

has a right to counsel that he necessarily understands the

23

sort of assistance counsel could provide.

No, Your Honor.

Did they say -- did they -- I mean,

I'm -- I am impressed by the fact that rule 11(b), which

is a product of the rulemaking process and presumably, I'm

that the ABA and everybody else lobby nonstop for this

kind of thing that they felt it was very desirable but not

so important that you had to actually include it in the

colloquy.

MS. WILSON:

Patterson, under Faretta, even as -- back as far as

Johnson v. Zerbst, this Court has required that any waiver

of a constitutional right be a voluntary, knowing, and

intelligent abandonment or relinquishment of a known right

9

or privilege.

10

QUESTION:

But, Ms. Wilson, you know, as to how

11

much that requires, when we invented the Miranda warning,

12

we -- we simply required that -- that the defendant be

told you have a right to counsel.

good advice.

Why -- even on this very record, when

he came for the sentencing, the judge did say, as Judge

you don't want more time to consider having counsel.

And

10

one of the questions I was going to ask you is given that

11

the judge was so solicitous at the sentencing hearing,

12

could the defendant at that point have said, judge, I've

thought about what I did at the plea hearing and I'd

So it -- it just seemed to me that a

judge, being so solicitous about this crime that didn't

carry any jail time, would -- would certainly say the one

that does carry jail -- jail time, yes, you think you want

to talk to a lawyer?

abeyance and you talk to your lawyer.

7

It's okay.

MS. WILSON:

Correct.

We'll hold it in

The -- the discussion

8

that the court had with Mr. Tovar was very abbreviated at

9

the arraignment.

At the time the court gave its

10

discussion, I see you're appearing here today without

11

counsel, do you wish to proceed pro se, the district court

12

had no idea whether Mr. Tovar was going to enter a plea of

13

guilty or not guilty.

14

that situation may come into a court believing that he

15

does not have a right to counsel simply because he's going

to plead guilty.

told him up to that point would have dissuaded him from

such a belief.

MS. WILSON:

It is and -- and the -- the State

9

not raise it as a denial of counsel case.

And it may be an error on my part I did
But in fact, in

10

the brief filed before the Iowa Supreme Court and the Iowa

11

Court of Appeals, I did raise the fact that Mr. Tovar was

12

not informed that he had a right to plea counsel, that the

13

only discussion of the right to counsel at that plea

14

hearing was in the context of the right to counsel at

15

trial he was waiving.

We're -- all of this -- it goes back

21

to a prior conviction not his most recent one I take it,

associated with the prior conviction, not this more recent

one.

MS. WILSON:

Correct, Your Honor, but the -- the

still a valid point, that regarding whether there needs to

So how do you deal with the question

that was posed that it raises a false hope, and if you

MS. WILSON:

It at least indicates that the

15

defendant has been given some warning regarding how an

16

attorney may assist him.

17

that the fact that you just merely tell a defendant that

18

he has a right to counsel, it doesn't necessarily help.

QUESTION:

And again, the -- the ABA says

Was it in this case that the judge

20

told the defendant he was not entitled to free counsel

21

because he was dependent on his parent where he was going

MS. WILSON:

Do you know any other jurisdiction

14

MS. WILSON:

Specific litany?

No.

I do believe

believe.

QUESTION:

When you say preferred, what do you

mean by that?

11

MS. WILSON:

It -- the failure to use those

But I guess it -- it's -- this issue, though it

hasn't been directly addressed in the brief, but obviously

7

it's a concern of the States whether this may have

retroactive effect or whether it's prospective effect as

9

far as its effect on recidivist statutes.

Mr. Tovar would

10

argue that these standards, if adopted, could be applied

11

prospectively because they do create a new rule.

12

they are certainly inspired by Patterson and by Faretta,

13

these particular admonishments are not required by those

cases, and again, those cases do not address the

particular context of a plea proceeding.

MS. WILSON:

And which one dropped the ball?

I -- I can't honestly answer that,

Your Honor.

9

But even assuming other jurisdictions do not use

10

these particular standards, the burden upon the State will

11

be alleviated for a number of reasons.

12

First, if for example, Iowa wanted to use a

13

guilty plea from another jurisdiction for enhancement, a

14

defendant would have the burden of proof on a collateral

15

attack.

16

a presumption that the waiver was invalid.

waiver through other means.

It is true Mr. Tovar did receive the mandatory

Unfortunately, that's not always the case

Defendant is charged with forgery for writing

himself does not say at the guilty plea whether he signs
