Mr. Wolfman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. WOLFMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1999, Randall Scarborough won his disability

12

appeal before the Veterans Court on the ground that the

13

Government's position constituted clear and unmistakable

14

error and that that position was, quote, not reasonably

15

debatable.

16

End quote.

He then immediately filed a fee application

17

under the Equal Access to Justice Act that contained three

18

of the elements called for by the act, but it did not

19

initially allege that the Government's position lacked

20

substantial justification.

21

The Government seized on that alleged omission

22

and without any mention of this Court's path-marking

23

decision in Irwin v. Veterans Affairs, both it and the

24

Federal Circuit determined that this omission of this

25

legal conclusion was jurisdictional, meaning in effect

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that Mr. Scarborough's amendment to the application could

2

not relate back to his timely filed application.

3

The Federal Circuit and the Government persisted

4

in this view even after this Court remanded in light of

5

Edelman v. Lynchburg College, which embraced the relation­

6

back doctrine both in a judicial and an administrative law

7

context.

8
9

The Federal Circuit's fundamental error here,
the basic mistake, is that it perceived EAJA's limitations

10

period as jurisdictional.

11

be squared with the decision in Irwin or as reiterated by

12

this Court just two terms ago in Franconia Associates, and

13

that principle is this: unless Congress has provided

14

otherwise, limitations periods that run in favor of the

15

Government like those involving private parties are not

16

jurisdictional, but rather are subject to ordinary statute

17

of limitations principles that provide exceptions under

18

certain circumstances.

19

As I said, that holding can't

And so then the question is, what does EAJA say

20

to this?

There's nothing in EAJA that even hints that the

21

statute creates the absolute -­

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. WOLFMAN:

24
25

EAJA is Equal Access to Justice.
Equal Access to Justice Act.

That's the acronym, Your Honor.
There -- there's nothing that even hints that

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the Court -- that the Congress created that type of

2

absolute time bar under EAJA.

3

contrary.

4

entertaining an EAJA application already has jurisdiction

5

over the action.

6

in that sense, absolute in that sense, because as this

7

Court just reiterated in Kontrick v. Ryan, EAJA doesn't

8

serve to place a class of cases within a court's

9

adjudicative authority.

10

In fact, quite the

The statute makes clear that a court

Simply put, EAJA can't be jurisdictional

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfman, if you're right about

11

that it's not jurisdictional, so there should be equitable

12

tolling, why should there be equitable -- what's equitable

13

about allowing a lawyer to overcome his carelessness?

14

mean, the -- the case of a layperson not getting a

15

verification is one thing.

16

says, do this, that, and the other, and he doesn't do the

17

other, and then it says, oh, but be equitable, court.

18

should a lawyer's carelessness be an occasion for

19

equitable tolling?

20

if this is just the lawyer's fee?

21

MR. WOLFMAN:

A lawyer reads a statute, it

No.

Well, I think there are

several answers to that, but let me take the last part

23

first, Your Honor.

25

Why

Is there anything in it for the client

22

24

I

First is that here actually the -- the client
has much coming.

These are the client's fees, and the

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

veterans statutes provide that the contingent fee, which

2

cannot exceed 20 percent, would be reduced dollar for

3

dollar by the EAJA recovery.

4

veterans claims, do have money at stake.

5
6
7

So the client here, as all

Let me turn to the question of equitable tolling
that you asked.
QUESTION:

Excuse me.

Explain that again.

The

8

contingence fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by the

9

recovery on -­

10

MR. WOLFMAN:

By the EAJA recovery, yes.

The -­

11

the statute -- the -- the veterans statutes provide that

12

the lawyer can enter a contingency arrangement with the

13

client, but that the fee can't -- can't exceed 20 percent

14

of the claimant's back benefits if he or she prevails.

15

But when -­

16

QUESTION:

That's the recovered back benefits?

17

MR. WOLFMAN:

That is correct, Your Honor.

So

18

there -- there can be no fee taken unless there's victory.

19

The statute also provides that.

20

However, a -- a statute also provides on what do

21

we do about the interaction between EAJA and this

22

statutory contingency fee.

23

for the same work, if there is an EAJA recovery, the

24

client must benefit by that.

25

recovery and that the contingent fee would be reduced

And what it provides is that

There can't be a double

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

dollar for dollar for the EAJA recovery.

2

QUESTION:

You could easily just reduce it if it

3

was the lawyer's negligence and stopped him getting the

4

contingency.

5
6

MR. WOLFMAN:

That is correct, but the law does

not provide.

7

QUESTION:

So -- so then we're back to where

8

Justice Ginsburg's question was.

You say, really, the

9

person who should suffer is the lawyer, if the lawyer is

10

negligent, not the client.

11

arrange.

12

the lawyer is negligent, well, the other side has to

13

suffer the consequence rather than the lawyer.

14

That would be pretty easy to

And you really want a rule that says whenever

MR. WOLFMAN:

Your -- Your Honor, first, there

15

could be such a rule if Congress so provided, and I

16

suppose -­

17

QUESTION:

Why couldn't you do it under a rule

18

of the court?

19

were sitting in that court, it wouldn't take me long to

20

try to figure that out unless Congress thought of -­

21

unless it forbid it somewhere.

22

you couldn't do it, but -- but I don't know -- what you've

23

read me doesn't sound as if it forbids it.

24
25

Why couldn't you just say -- I mean, if I

MR. WOLFMAN:

I mean, if it forbid it,

I think it is true that the -- the

statutes that I've just talked about don't forbid that.

Whether rulemaking authority enters into that kind of

substantive arena, I think that would be unusual because

ordinarily that would be governed by State malpractice -­

didn't get compensation that would enable me to pay that

fee.

I think that's -- that's what the

if I might.

I would like to go back to the -­

Let's go back to the main issue.
-- question of equitable tolling,

And -- and let me answer that in two ways.

First of all, there is a category of equitable

21

tolling that's set out in the Irwin decision and others

22

which if -- if a claimant filed -- timely files a -- an

23

action, that -- that is properly filed but

24

jurisdictionally defective in some way, that equitable

25

tolling is a -- is a basis for allowing some forbearance

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in that circumstance -­

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfman, I -- I don't understand

3

why we have to first address equitable tolling.

4

why don't we look at the statute and see whether it is

5

necessary that this allegation that the U.S. was not

6

substantially justified has to be made within 30 days?

7

mean, if it doesn't, why do you get into equitable tolling

8

at all?

9

requires?

10

I mean,

I

Why don't you start with what the statute
I thought that was what the split was about.
MR. WOLFMAN:

We -- Your Honor, with all

11

respect, no.

12

the -- this -- whether the statute requires the allegation

13

of no substantial justification in the 30 days.

14

was on the question -­

15

The split was not on the question of what

QUESTION:

The split

Do you take -- do you take the

16

position that under the statute, the Equal Access to

17

Justice Act statute, subsection (B), that that allegation

18

does not have to be made within the 30-day period?

19

MR. WOLFMAN:

We do and we briefed that

20

extensively both in our opening brief and our -- and our

21

reply brief.

22
23

QUESTION:

And do you plan to address it this

morning with us?
MR. WOLFMAN:

I'd be happy to address it right

now if -- if Your Honor will allow, which is that -­

1

3

QUESTION:

Well, it just looks like a lot easier

argument to me than equitable tolling.
MR. WOLFMAN:

Let me answer that.

The -- the

4

answer is the plain language of the statute, the first -­

5

the first sentence of (d) -- of section (d)(1)(A) -­

6

(d)(1)(B) -- excuse me -- says that there shall be three

7

things alleged and that they must be done within 30 days.

8

The next sentence, which is the one that is at issue here,

9

says that the -- the parties shall also allege that the

10

position of the Government is not substantially justified,

11

and that sentence does not include the 30-day time limit.

12

That is one of our arguments in this case.

13
14

QUESTION:

And that's similar to the kind of

interpretation the Court had to face in Edelman, isn't it?

15

MR. WOLFMAN:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. WOLFMAN:

18

directly in our brief.

19

QUESTION:

It is.

I mean, you know -­
And that -- we make that argument

In Edelman, it wasn't in the -- it

20

didn't follow immediately as part of the same paragraph

21

and the -- the what leaps to mind when you read a sentence

22

that says the parties shall also allege, is where?

23

shall the party allege this?

24

separate paper later?

25

is found in the preceding sentence:

Where

Is he supposed to file a

The logical answer to that question
shall within 30 days

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

submit to the court an application which shows that the

2

party is a prevailing party and is eligible to receive an

3

award stating the actual time, blah, blah.

The party

4

shall also allege.

In that

5

application that is referred to in the preceding sentence.

6

Surely it means where?

It seems to me you're making a -- a -- just a

7

mess of -- of that paragraph to say, you know, you can

8

file a paper, who knows, 9 months later alleging that.

9

That -- that's just not a -- that's not a reasonable

10

reading of it, it seems to me.

11

MR. WOLFMAN:

But, Your Honor, we disagree and

12

the reason is it's in that separate sentence and there are

13

subsequent proceedings in the case.

15

There are sometimes hearings where that -­

the case?

There are subsequent

It doesn't matter at all when it's

You can wait until, you know, the very end of

MR. WOLFMAN:

19

QUESTION:

That -- that is -­

The Government has to go along not

20

even knowing whether you claim that the Government's

21

position was substantially justified?

22

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, on that question, the -- the

23

burden is on the Government to show that its position was

24

substantially justified.

25

QUESTION:

That's the point.

The statute places

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the burden on the Government to prove that its position

2

was not substantially justified.

3

MR. WOLFMAN:

4

submission.

5

parsed it in this way.

6

That is correct, and that is our

So the question is why might Congress have

QUESTION:

It's the burden of proof as opposed

7

to the burden of making the allegation of -- of setting

8

the -- the point in controversy.

9

MR. WOLFMAN:

That -- that is correct in the

10

sense that -- that the statute is unusual and that it -­

11

it's -- it does say that the party seeking fees shall

12

allege the position of the Government lacks substantial

13

justification.

14

conceded here that the Government has the burden of

15

persuasion on that question.

16

But there's no question -- and it is

QUESTION:

So in -- in this respect -­

You mean, even if you don't allege

17

it, the Government has to come in and show that its

18

position was -- even though it's never alleged.

19

you don't say that.

20

MR. WOLFMAN:

21

QUESTION:

Surely

Your Honor, it -­

What -- what if you have a lawyer

22

that hasn't read the statute and he doesn't realize, that

23

he thinks if he won the case, he gets his fees?

24

just files this without any allegation that the

25

Government's case was not substantially justified.

And so he

We -­

The Government still has to come in

and prove that its case was substantially justified?

MR. WOLFMAN:

No.

point the statute makes clear that at some point the

6

applicant will have to make that allegation.

QUESTION:

8

MR. WOLFMAN:

9

QUESTION:

10

I think the -­

-- for that -- for that claim to be

made?

11
12

What would be the logical point -­

MR. WOLFMAN:

In all candor, Your Honor, the

most logical point is at the outset.

13

QUESTION:

Of course.

14

MR. WOLFMAN:

We don't disagree with that.

But

15

our position is that if you look at the statute, the

16

statute doesn't contain that 30-day limit within the

17

second sentence, and following on Justice O'Connor's

18

question, there is potentially good reason for that which

19

is that the burden on that question is on the Government.

20

We don't know why because it is not revealed entirely why

21

the 30-day limit is not in the second sentence.

22

QUESTION:

Well, that would be a good reason for

23

omitting the requirement entirely, but I don't think it's

24

a very good reason for saying that the 30-day rule doesn't

25

apply.

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WOLFMAN:

The 30-day -- well, that is our

2

position, Your Honor, and I think -- I think we've

3

exhausted the reasons why Congress might have done it.

4

May I go back to the initial question?

Because

5

I want to -- I want to clarify something.

I initially got

6

a question about equitable tolling, but our principal

7

submission here and I think the easiest way to resolve

8

this case is that this -- this provision is not

9

jurisdictional.

Mr. Scarborough filed on time, and so

10

it's a perfect example of where the relation-back doctrine

11

would apply.

12

This is a typical relation-back situation.

13

-- the application was filed.

It was timely.

14

an omission and Mr. Scarborough, immediately upon the

15

omission being brought to his attention, filed an

16

amendment that made this 10 -- this 10-word legal

17

conclusion, and that should be the end of the matter.

The

There was

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfman -­

19

QUESTION:

Will you just clarify one thing for

20

me?

21

Justice Ginsburg, but if he has a contingent fee of 20

22

percent, he gets a $1,000 recovery and a $200 fee, and he

23

goes -- now he gets -- files an EAJA position, if he

24

recovers precisely $200, that goes to the client?

25

I want -- I think I understood your answer, but -- to

That would be correct.

QUESTION:

MR. WOLFMAN:

3

QUESTION:

But in all events, the client would

get a piece of the recovery under EAJA.

6
7

Then the $100 -- then $200 would

go to the client and $100 would go to the lawyer.

4
5

What if he recovered $300?

MR. WOLFMAN:

That is correct unless, for some

reason, there was not a contingency fee.

MR. WOLFMAN:

That is correct.

Not a contingency fee.

Yes.

-- contingent fee cases.
In almost all cases there are.

16

And as I say, the statute allows it up to but not in

17

excess of 20 percent.

18

QUESTION:

Am I right in thinking that your

19

client did not file the allegation about the Government's

20

position being unjustified until after the Government

21

moved to dismiss?

expired.

within the 30 days.

QUESTION:

17

MR. WOLFMAN:

Okay.

So -­

If I assume that, then yes, the

18

answer to your question is yes, that we would apply those

19

ordinary common law exceptions.

20

Now, judges -­

Aside from that, now -- now take the

other part of your argument and say, no, no, it's really

I don't know how much to make of that.

This fourth one is really

conclusive.

I'm not saying it isn't, but I want to be

MR. WOLFMAN:

I think the other thing that -­

6

that I would like to put in front of you -- and this had

7

to do with my colloquy with Justice O'Connor -- which is

8

that there is a different character that -- to that

9

allegation.

It is a mere allegation and it simply

10

notifies the Government about its substantial

11

justification defense.

Well -- well, there's -- there's more

than that to it.

I think that is a fair point, Your

Honor, and let me answer that this way.
QUESTION:

So to follow up, I mean, what -- what

22

this means is we -- we want to be sure, when this thing is

23

filed, that it's not just nuisance stuff.

24

lawyer, when the thing is filed within the 30 days, to be

25

standing on his reputation as an officer of the court

We want a

1

that, in fact, the Government's position wasn't

2

substantial.

3

MR. WOLFMAN:

I got that, and let -- if -- if I

4

might let me answer that.

Because then I think if we

5

conceive of the purpose of this allegation as making a

6

lawyer think twice, then it puts the case in the realm of

7

Edelman and Becker where in Becker you had a signature

8

requirement, Edelman you had a verification requirement,

9

and those -- those requirements are things that are

10

supposed to make the filing party think a little bit

11

before he or she does the filing.

12

But in both of those cases, the Court said,

13

okay, we realize the purpose of it, but we will still

14

allow supplication -- supplementation of the application,

15

and we'll allow them to amend and to relate back unless

16

the adverse party is prejudiced.

17

And it's hard to conceive of the prejudice here.

18

QUESTION:

We -- we may not be as tender to

19

attorneys who should know better as we are to -- to

20

litigants who maybe had a bad attorney or didn't know

21

better themselves.

22

MR. WOLFMAN:

Well, with -- with all respect,

23

Your Honor, I think that might in part, at least in part,

24

explain Edelman.

25

Becker did involve a pro se applicant, but as we know,

But I do not believe it explains Becker.

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

most appellants in the courts are -- are parties that are

2

represented by lawyers, and Becker held unequivocally that

3

the failure to sign was not fatal and that, in fact, the

4

-- the amended, signed notice of appeal could relate back.

5

And that's all that's being requested here.

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Wolfman, I was surprised that you

7

didn't cite 1653 of title 28 which says defective

8

allegations of jurisdiction may be amended upon terms.

9

mean, if you say, okay, even assuming it were

10

jurisdictional, if it were jurisdictional -- even if it

11

were jurisdictional, you could still amend with the

12

court's permission.

13

MR. WOLFMAN:

QUESTION:

What are they?

MR. WOLFMAN:

-- a court would look to rule 15

which codifies the relation-back doctrine and says, number

that's quite apparent the courts would apply is, is the

21

22

23

Here, there's never been any claim of prejudice nor could

there be, I don't think, because the Government responds

Do you think that after 2-and-a-half years you could

MR. WOLFMAN:

I think that would be a much more

legislation that was vetoed by the President.

enacted, very similar legislative history appears, and

it's -- it drops that line and says as follows.

Mr. Minear, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY P. MINEAR

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5

MR. MINEAR:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

6

Section 2412(d) requires that EAJA fee

7

applicants submit an application within 30 days of a final

8

judgment that includes an allegation that the Government's

9

position was not substantially justified.

Petitioner's

10

lawyer failed to do so in this case and for that reason

11

fails to qualify for fees.

12

This Court has no power to amend EAJA or to

13

excuse lawyers from their carelessness in failing to

14

follow its requirements.

15

QUESTION:

Are there any instances in which the

16

Government is liable for fees even if its position was

17

substantially justified?

18

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, under section 2412(b), EAJA

19

subjects the United States to fees on the same basis as

20

other parties in other legislation.

21

By contrast, section 2412(d) provides a special

22

provision, distinct from those provisions that apply to

23

private parties and the United States generally, that

24

requires there be a showing that the Government's position

25

was not substantially justified.

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

There are also some -- some other

2

statutes besides EAJA in which the Government, when it

3

loses, whether its position was substantially justified or

4

not, is subject to -- to fees.

5

correct?

6

MR. MINEAR:

Isn't that -- isn't that

Yes, if I can clarify.

Section

7

2412(b) indicates the Government is waiving its sovereign

8

immunity as to those other statutes.

9

QUESTION:

10

Right.

MR. MINEAR:

So in the case of 2412(b), it puts

11

the United States on the same par as private parties, and

12

in that sense, it's comparable to the situation that was

13

faced in Irwin where the United States is subject to Title

14

VII actions on the same basis as private parties.

15

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I think you know where I

16

was going.

17

confused when it received this document or did it

18

naturally assume that it would have to show that this

19

position was substantially justified?

20

would there have been some other theory in which the

21

Government might have thought it would have been really

22

liable for these fees?

23

Was -- was the Government somehow puzzled or

MR. MINEAR:

In other words,

Justice Kennedy, I have two answers

24

for that.

First of all, the statute requires that these

25

conditions be met, and these are conditions on the

Government's -­
QUESTION:

Well, that's the issue we're -- we're

talking about.
MR. MINEAR:

And these are conditions on the

5

Government's waiver of sovereign immunity.

6

Government has an obligation to insist that parties comply

7

with those conditions -­

8

QUESTION:

So the

Well, that's -- that's true.

The

9

question is whether this allegation has to be made within

10

the 30 days or whether it can be offered subsequently as

11

an amendment.

12

MR. MINEAR:

13

QUESTION:

That's -­

Clearly it has to be made.

And the

14

Government certainly was not in doubt about the fact that

15

its -- it wasn't going to be liable for the fees unless it

16

was in due course made.

17
18

MR. MINEAR:
regard to this.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. MINEAR:

21

I'd like to make two points with

Yes.
First of all, with regard to the

30-day time limit -­

22

QUESTION:

Right.

23

MR. MINEAR:

-- this Court indicated in INS v.

24

Jean, 496 U.S. at 160, that the 30-day requirement does

25

apply to the allegation of no substantial justification.

As we explain in our brief, Jean indicates it's a 30-day

2

requirement and at page 160 they say that the fee

3

application has to include -­

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. MINEAR:

6

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear, can I -­
-- this allegation.

Can I ask you sort of a basic

7

question?

8

aren't they?

9

counsel may meet and discuss whether they can settle the

10

Sometimes these things are negotiated I think,
After the fee application is filed, the

fee application?

11

MR. MINEAR:

12

QUESTION:

That is correct.

During -- if such a meeting took

13

place 15 days after the application was filed, do you

14

think the Government lawyer would have an ethical duty to

15

tell the plaintiff's lawyer -- say, you goofed and forgot

16

the no-substantial-justification allegation in your -- in

17

your request?

18

MR. MINEAR:

The Government -- the Government

19

attorney might have that obligation in the course of

20

settlement negotiations.

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. MINEAR:

23
24
25

What would be the -­
But in adversary litigation, the

United States certainly doesn't have the obligation -­
QUESTION:

What would be the basis of settlement

I mean,

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

long ago the Court said that you didn't -- that opponents

2

couldn't live by their adversaries' wits.

3

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, that's -- and I agree with

4

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

5

these matters, there's a possibility that there could -­

6

that the Government has to be careful not to mislead the

7

party, and so that's where an ethical obligation could

8

come forward.

9

But in the course of discussing

But in this case, there were no negotiations of

10

that type.

11

obligation to respond to the fee application, and we

12

responded appropriately.

13

Rather, there's simply the Government's

QUESTION:

But -- but in this -- in this case

14

the application did say that it was pursuant to 2412.

15

as I indicated and Justice O'Connor said, the Government

16

was under no -- no mistaken assumptions about the

17

applicability of this section and this section only.

18

MR. MINEAR:

But the United States was not on

19

notice whether this party was contesting that the

20

Government's position was not substantially justified.

21

QUESTION:

So

Do you take the position that there

22

is any point in requiring that allegation to be made other

23

than the point that was described in the earlier half of

24

the argument?

25

to put the lawyer on notice that there is a responsibility

fee litigation under this act.

3

MR. MINEAR:

4

QUESTION:

5

There -­

Is -- is there any other reason for

it?

6

MR. MINEAR:

There are three reasons.

First of

7

all, it's a condition that Congress placed on sovereign

8

immunity.

9

the United States representing Congress' will must respect

10

And by that alone, the courts and lawyers and

it.

11

Second, this obligation requires the party, as

12

was articulated earlier, to examine the Government's

13

position and make a determination of whether or not they

14

wish to contest whether it is substantially justified or

15

not.

17

So that does put that additional obligation on

24

25

make that allegation.

We

If the lawyer is really serious, the

At that point, the United States

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

knows where it stands and presumably it has the -- the

2

benefit of the lawyer's sense of responsibility for going

3

forward and you go forward.

4

MR. MINEAR:

Except that the party did not

5

comply with the condition that Congress imposed on its

6

waiver of sovereign immunity.

7

QUESTION:

Mr. Minear -­

8

QUESTION:

But other than that, the Government

9

has not really been prejudiced in anyway.

The Government

10

knows of the substantial justification rule and it's

11

either ready to defend or -- or acquiesce on that point.

12

MR. MINEAR:

Well, the Government and the courts

13

are both prejudiced by this because it requires two

14

additional filings that otherwise would not need to be

15

made if the lawyer had not been careless.

16

In this situation -- we face thousands of suits

17

that potentially implicate EAJA claims, and Congress

18

recognized that these are matters that need to be resolved

19

quickly with minimal litigation in contradistinction to

20

what's happened in this case.

21

QUESTION:

And -­

Mr. Minear, the -- the Federal

22

Circuit obviously doesn't agree entirely with the position

23

you're now saying, you have to do everything up front.

24

And what struck me as curious is the Federal

25

Circuit allows you to flesh out allegations.

So, for

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

example, you say I -- I want a fee of $1,000 but you don't

2

put in the itemization.

3

Circuit's position, they allow you to flesh out something

4

that -- that really seems to me is a lot more substantial,

5

to document your fee.

6

So it seems to me, if you're saying -- if you're taking

7

the position you must do everything within 30 days, then

8

you would have to say the Federal Circuit is wrong in

9

saying you can flesh out allegations.

10

MR. MINEAR:

But this is a pro forma allegation.

Well, those issues are not before

11

the Court at this time.

12

different view on that.

13

As I understand the Federal

The United States does have a

But I must disagree that is a pro forma

14

allegation.

15

not require the lawyers to comply with the letter of the

16

law because we don't think they're going to comply with

17

doctrine.
QUESTION:

You said you'd give us some reasons

why this is important to the Government.
MR. MINEAR:

Yes, and the reasons were, first of

13

all, our obligation to defend those conditions that

14

Congress places on its waiver of sovereign immunity, and

15

second, to ensure that there is efficient processing of

16

attorney application fees.

to this in the first part of the argument, and as I said

before, the Government faces thousands of these requests,

and it's very important they be -- be resolved promptly.

20

And they can only be resolved promptly if parties follow

21

the rules that Congress has laid down.

22

why Congress set these rules, because they wanted to make

23

sure that attorney claims would be resolved efficiently,

24

and they cannot be resolved efficiently if parties don't

25

play by the rules.

Justice Breyer made allusion

Now, the relation-back doctrine is really an

2

exception to the rules that Congress set forward, at least

3

the -- the relation-back doctrine, as the -- as

4

petitioners are suggesting it ought to be applied here.

As a general matter, the relation-back doctrine is a

principle that's codified in rules, such as rule 15 of the

have specified that.

QUESTION:

If

Wasn't there a relation-back doctrine

that courts were applying before it was codified in 15(c)?

The examples that petitioner points

to are cases involving the Federal Employees Liability Act

19

involving the injuries to interstate -- to railmen who are

20

working in interstate commerce.

21

the Court had applied that as a common law principle

22

indicating, as in Keene, that those arguments on either

side for that particular rule.

say that there's a general principle of relation-back.

MR. MINEAR:

No, I would not.

But there was in States -- some

States also had a relation-back doctrine.

6

MR. MINEAR:

And the note in rule 15(c), the

7

1937 note to the Federal rules talks about codifications

8

of this, but we're talking here about a situation where

9

Congress has set a time limit and has not provided for

10

relation-back, a case where we're dealing with sovereign

11

immunity, where this is a charge against the Federal fisc.

And so we have -­

And to imply a relation-back

doctrine is to negate Congress' specific intent in this

case.

12

With regard to equitable tolling, this Court

13

said in Irwin that equitable tolling will be presumed to

14

apply in those cases involving Government waivers of

15

sovereign immunity where the Government is held liable on

16

the same basis as private parties as in title VII.

17

my colloquy with Justice Stevens pointed out, this is not

a situation where the United States is being held liable

19

for attorneys fees on the same basis as other parties.

whether equitable tolling can apply or not?

13

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

Yes, you can.

Because as I understand the relation­

in that 30-day period.

And this

Now, to apply any sort of relation-back doctrine

Congress imposed on this charge against the treasury.

are, how many times the Government contests the

these cases, and efficiency is paramount unless fee

what is the satellite litigation beyond your filing the

motion to dismiss because they didn't make the allegation?

should apply, under what situations it should apply,

decides this case and suppose it should say that relation­

wouldn't be any satellite litigation.

7

MR. MINEAR:

Well, Your Honor, as -- as you

pointed out, relation-back is not automatic.

So there

would be these questions of whether or not whatever

10

criteria the Court decides to create for relation-back

were satisfied.

12

And I have to point out the Court is going to be

creating all of these rules.

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, our feeling is that

these showings can be made very easily.

your judgment.

You can show that you qualify for fees by

Itemization is not all that

Attorneys keep these records.

QUESTION:

But the itemization is -- is what the

MR. MINEAR:

You can show that

Yes.

And I -- I wanted to see your fix on

I suppose you would say the Federal Circuit

is wrong to allow any leeway on -- on that.
MR. MINEAR:

We think that -- that the better

3

rule is that itemization should be -- be complete at the

4

time the application is -- is filed.

5

that issue, certainly the threshold allegation that's at

6

issue here does need to be made, and this is the trigger

7

that -- that determines whether or not the Government

8

needs to respond to the fee application at all.

9

the party has not made that basic determination -­

10

QUESTION:

However we deal with

And if

You characterize it as a trigger.

Do

11

you defend the court of appeals' characterization of the

12

requirement as a jurisdictional requirement?

13

MR. MINEAR:

Your Honor, I think it can be

14

described as jurisdictional in the sense that term is used

15

in Sherwood v. United States, that sovereign immunity is a

16

condition -- the conditions of -- that waive sovereign

17

immunity are limitations defining the scope of the Court's

18

jurisdiction.

19

become applied.

I think that's how that terminology has

QUESTION:

So your answer is yes.

21

MR. MINEAR:

22

I think it might be more accurate to say it's a

Yes.

23

sovereign immunity-based limitation, but that carries with

24

it the very same point.

25

construed.

Namely, it needs to be strictly

Courts have no power to expand it beyond what

50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

its normal confines would be.

2

So the term jurisdictional is just a label.

3

What's important is the substance of conditions on

4

sovereign immunity, and that is they need to be strictly

5

construed and cannot be enlarged beyond what Congress has

6

provided.

7

QUESTION:

What -- what's your best case in

8

support of your position of a strict interpretation of a

9

requirement like this, other than cases about sovereign

10
11

immunity being -- it can't be expanded?
MR. MINEAR:

Cases such as -- some of these

12

cases are not cited in the brief, but Brokamp, Locke, a

13

number of these cases involving statutes of limitation

14

where Congress has -- where this Court has ruled that the

15

emphatic statute of limitation that Congress has set is

16

determinative.

17

I'd also point out to Justice Frankfurter's

18

statement in Holmberg v. Armbrecht where he said that when

19

Congress sets a statute of limitation, there is the end of

20

the matter.

21

is definitive.

22

The statute of limitation that Congress set

QUESTION:

Of course, Locke was a case involving

23

a total failure to file on time, not omitting an

24

allegation in the filing.

25

MR. MINEAR:

That's true, but again, I'm not

51
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sure a real distinction can be made there because, as I

2

said before, when we look at what is a fee application, we

3

define a fee application by those things that Congress

4

said are defined as content.

5

Ultimately I think the important point here is

6

that strict adherence to these types of statutory rules is

7

the best guarantee of fairness in these cases.

case where the burden that is placed on the attorneys is

9

minimal and we believe that this Court should follow what

This is a

11

QUESTION:

But the burden of the real result is

12

placed on the client.

I mean, the burden -- the -- the

13

real loser here is not the lawyer.

MR. MINEAR:

QUESTION:

17

It's the client.

Well, in the case where -­

The lawyer gets the same amount in

MR. MINEAR:

Yes, and an attorney who is

to charge his -- his client for his carelessness.

QUESTION:

Why would he have that obligation?

Because the statute is absolute.

MR. MINEAR:
actually.

The statute is not so absolute

I believe the provision that we're talking

about here, which is 38 U.S.C. 5904, does allow the Court

2

of Veterans Claims to adjust fee applications in the event

that they're not fair, if there are some inequities that

4

are involved in them.

5

extent the court has -- has exercised that authority, but

6

it certainly has -- does have that authority under the

7

statutory provisions that are at issue here.

Now, I'm not sure to what's -- what

QUESTION:

Thank you, Mr. Minear.

Mr. Wolfman, you have 4 minutes remaining.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF BRIAN WOLFMAN

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MR. WOLFMAN:

I'd like to go immediately to

13

Justice Kennedy's question.

14

Well, the case that the Government relies on principally

15

in its brief is Soriano v. the United States.

16

with that case is it was overruled by Irwin, and the

17

problem here is that the principle we're now operating on,

18

the problem with the Government, is that when we talk

19

about statutes of limitations principles, you apply the

20

same principles that apply among private parties unless

21

Congress explicitly provides otherwise.

22

He asked about the best case.

The problem

Now, I did want to, if I might, turn to the

23

relation-back doctrine just briefly.

And the -- the

24

question arose in Mr. Minear's presentation, well, this

25

case doesn't involve rule 15(c).

But either did Edelman

2

applied the common law doctrine of relation-back.

3

Court held, regardless of the EEOC's regulation, even if

4

we were interpreting the statute from scratch, we would

5

apply the relation doctrine back here because it has a

6

common law pedigree.

here.

8

Edelman is best read as a case that
The

And that's all we're asking for

The other principal submission by Mr. Minear is

the efficiency argument, that these matters have to be

suits.

12

the specific.

13

I have two basic answers to that, the general and

The general is that the -- until the Federal

14

Circuit ruled, this was the rule, the rule that we're

15

asking for, in all of the circuits that had ruled on it.

16

And the Government does not present an iota of evidence

17

there were any problems in applying the relation-back

18

principle in those circuits.

25

the Government interposed this jurisdictional defense and

The matter would have been resolved 3

There is no serious efficiency concern

The reason we're here much later is both because

1

it asked for seven or eight extensions of time during the

2

course of this litigation.

3

The final thing I would like to say is that the

4

Government's arguments presuppose that there's no good

5

reason for relaxing rules.

6

litigants and lawyers make mistakes and rules such as

7

relation-back serve important purposes so that litigants

8

and lawyers don't get tripped up by technical rules such

as the one the court -- that the court below and the
