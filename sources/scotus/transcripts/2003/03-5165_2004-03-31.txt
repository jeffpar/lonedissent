CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in No. 03-5165, Marcus Thornton v. the United States.

5

Mr. Dunham.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. DUNHAM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

The central issue in this case is whether the

11

Government, having failed to prove that the police

12

initiated contact with Petitioner Thornton while he was an

13

occupant of his automobile and having failed to prove that

14

when Mr. Thornton was arrested, that he was even within

15

reaching distance of his automobile, may rely on New York

16

v. Belton to justify a warrantless, suspicionless search

17

of Mr. Thornton's automobile incident to arrest.

18

Now, it's the Government's burden -­

19

QUESTION:

Well, now, Belton did involve a car

20

search after the suspects had left the car and were under

21

arrest.

22
23

They weren't in a position to reach into the car.
MR. DUNHAM:

They were within reaching distance

of the vehicle, Justice O'Connor.

24

QUESTION:

And arrested.

25

MR. DUNHAM:

They -- they were standing by the

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

side of the car at the -- at the moment of arrest.

2

QUESTION:

Right, but then they were disabled by

3

the arrest.

4

that, the search occurred, and we -- we said, okay, that

5

you could search if -- for a recent occupant of the

6

vehicle.

7

Belton weren't all that clear, but it may cover this case.

8
9

They couldn't reach into the car, and after

I just -- I think the reasons articulated in

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe

that when you focus on the word recent, it's not a very

10

bright line test unless you flesh it out and give it some

11

definition.

12

automobile this morning.

13

recently in that, but that wouldn't mean that they could

14

go search it.

I believe I was a recent occupant of my
Somebody could say I was

15

Well, the facts show -­

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. DUNHAM:

Do we know from the facts here?
-- a lot less -- the facts here

18

show a lot less time, but recent doesn't give the kind of

19

clear bright line that Belton said it was trying to draw

20

because it -- it's open to a lot of interpretation.

21

Our -­

22

QUESTION:

How about moments?

23

QUESTION:

You conceded -- the Fourth Circuit

24

said that it was conceded in the -- that he was in close

25

proximity to his vehicle when Officer Nichols approached

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

him, and the record does conclusively show that Officer

2

Nichols observed Thornton park and exit his automobile and

3

then approached Thornton within moments.

4

dispute any of that I take it.

5
6
7

MR. DUNHAM:

No.

You don't

Those -- those are the facts

of the case, Your Honor.
But moments again -- is he -- is he 5 yards, 10

8

yards, 15 yards away from the vehicle?

We -- I think we

9

need to go back to what Belton was all about.

Belton said

10

that it concerns the proper -- quoting at page 459 of the

11

Belton opinion, it says the proper scope of a search of

12

the interior of an automobile, incident to a lawful

13

custodian -- custodial arrest of its occupants.

14

Belton rule itself says, quote, at page 460, when a

15

policeman has made a lawful arrest of the occupants of an

16

automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that

17

arrest, search the passenger compartment of that

18

automobile.

19

And the

Belton was focusing on that highly dangerous

20

situation when a police officer initiates contact with and

21

approaches a -- an occupied vehicle.

22

recognized in Pennsylvania v. Mimms, that may be the most

23

highly dangerous situation an officer faces.

24
25

QUESTION:

As this Court

But there was no search until the -­

Belton was -- wasn't he in -- in the patrol car by the

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

time they started the search?

2
3

MR. DUNHAM:

So was Mr. Thornton, Your Honor,

and I -­

4

QUESTION:

But -- so I -- that's what I don't -­

5

it's quite different from search into -- incident to

6

arrest.

7

defendant may still grab a gun.

8

is that when the defendant -- when the suspect is sitting

9

in the patrol car with handcuffs on, there isn't any

10

danger that the police faces when they're doing the

11

search.

12

search -- do the search.

13

The -- the area around the defendant, the
But the one thing we know

When they arrested him, yes, but not when they

MR. DUNHAM:

I would agree with that 100

14

percent, Your Honor, but the converse of that position is

15

that in order to do the search, the -- that he's allowed

16

to do under the Fourth Amendment, that -- that right to

17

search fixes at the moment he effects the custodial

18

arrest.

19

require the officer to conduct that search with the

20

suspect at his elbow.

21

You don't want to -- or it's not reasonable to

So while I would agree with Your Honor as a -­

22

as a very practical matter, there is no danger to the

23

officer in the situation where the man is arrested,

24

stuffed in the back of the squad car, and then we go

25

search, that's kind of a fiction.

But on the other hand,

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it may be a kind of a reasonable fiction because

2

otherwise, the converse is, if the officer is going to

3

search the car, he's got to do it with Mr. Thornton or Mr.

4

Belton standing right beside him.

5

QUESTION:

And that's why -­

So you don't object to the search

6

taking place when there's no danger to the officer, but

7

you say in order to do that non-dangerous search, the

8

officer has to put himself in danger when he makes the

9

arrest.

10

MR. DUNHAM:

That's -- that's right.

I -- and I

11

-- and I believe, Your Honor, that's why -- this case is

12

really presenting a situation where we're dealing with the

13

harm to the Fourth Amendment instead of really dealing

14

with potential danger to the officer.

15

practices are going to have a Mr. Belton or a Mr. Thornton

16

in the back of the squad car at the time these searches

18

QUESTION:

Modern police

of petitioner?

MR. DUNHAM:

Your Honor, there may or may not -­

Is that contested?
The -- that ground, that exception

to the warrant requirement was not advanced by the

Isn't that right?

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, not necessarily, Your Honor.

We're not conceding that particularly in this case.

Maybe that's somewhat fictional.

MR. DUNHAM:

You could make the same argument

13

with regard to the house in Chimel, that we limit the

14

search to the area within reaching distance in the room

15

that the man is in.

16

or the bedroom.

17

There could be guns there.

20

We don't let him go into the kitchen

But there could be accomplices there.

QUESTION:
and cars are not.

Houses are -- houses are stationary

So we have to draw the line there.

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, it -- the -- if the -- the

21

justification in Belton for allowing the vehicle search

22

says it's not a departure from Chimel, and it limits the

23

search to an area within the reaching distance.

24

based on a generalization, Your Honor, that everything

25

within the narrow passenger compartment of the vehicle is

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

It's

within reach of an occupant.

2

an occupant and has become a pedestrian and is walking on

3

the street, that generalization that he can reach

4

everything in the narrow passenger compartment of an

5

automobile no longer makes any sense.

6

QUESTION:

Now, when a man is no longer

Well, then -- then Belton should have

7

been -- if you're right, Belton should have -- not have

8

been decided the way it was.

9

MR. DUNHAM:

10

absolutely correctly I believe.

11

Belton was approached by the officer while he was an

12

occupant of the vehicle.

13

out of the car.

14

search incident to arrest doctrine turn on whether the

15

officer decides to have him step out before he places him

16

under arrest or arrest him, sit him in the -- sitting in

17

the vehicle.

18

Your Honor, Belton was decided
The -- the -- Roger

The officer asked him to step

I do not believe that we want to have our

Five other -­

QUESTION:

Well, suppose this -- this officer

19

lets Mr. Thornton go to the shopping mall but is standing

20

guard next to the car and Mr. Thornton then comes back,

21

enters the car and just as he enters, the police officer

22

says, you're arrested.

23

MR. DUNHAM:

Then he could do -­
In my view he would not be able to

24

do a Belton search.

He would be able to a Chimel search.

25

He'd be able to arrest the individual under Chimel, which

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is still the -- the law in this Court, and he would be

2

able to conduct a search of anything within Mr. Thornton's

3

reaching distance at the time.

4

QUESTION:

So if -­

5

QUESTION:

So if the car were -- the car door

6

were unlocked and his reach would have been long enough to

7

get inside the -- the car if the door were open, he could

8

search into the car?

9

MR. DUNHAM:

If -- if the -- if the car was -­

10

if he could -- he could search for anything within

11

reaching distance of the person he's arresting.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. DUNHAM:

14

What about the answer to my question?
If he could reach into the car, he

could -- he could get anything within the man's reach.

15

QUESTION:

Why is that reasonable?

Why doesn't

16

he tell him, look it, move off, get -- get 10 yards away

17

from the car, get 20 yards away, however?

18

you -- you don't really suggest that there is a necessity

19

to conduct a Belton search in order to protect the

20

officer.

21

I -- I mean,

All he has to do is say, get away from the car.
MR. DUNHAM:

Well, I -- I agree with Your Honor

22

that if he hasn't arrested the man and he has an

23

opportunity to let the man move away from the car before

24

he conducts the arrest, he's certainly acting as a prudent

25

officer in protecting his own safety.

I would agree with

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that.

2

QUESTION:

It seems to me -­

3

QUESTION:

Belton must then rest on some kind of

4

bright line administrative consideration because you're

5

attacking Belton in various ways which are logical.

6

our problem I think in this case is to decide whether the

7

particular limit that you propose makes sense, and that's

8

where I'm having a problem because what you say is that

9

the -- the line to be drawn around Belton is not just a

10

line of -- in time and space, which I could understand.

11

But you want to say it depends on whether the policeman

12

initiated conduct with the individual before he exited the

13

car.

14

distinguish between the case where the policeman notices a

15

wanted suspect driving, pulls over to the side.

16

police -- the -- the suspect takes off and runs over to a

17

fence.

18

But

And that seems to me that you're trying to

Now, that would be okay.

The

That's Belton.

But the car stops before the policeman

19

recognizes him.

20

policeman recognizes him, and then he takes off for the

21

fence and it's exactly the same.

22

not Belton.

23

The driver gets out and then the

That you would say is

Now -- now, that line that you're drawing there

24

to me -- I -- I don't understand it at all in terms of the

25

Belton rationale or administrative.

It would make it more

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

complicated and it wouldn't achieve that much.

2

-- in other words, I want you to explain why that line is

3

a rational way of limiting Belton.

4

MR. DUNHAM:

It seems

I would suggest, Your Honor, that

5

the man who exits the vehicle and runs to the fence, 15,

6

20, 30 yards from the vehicle, whether he did it because

7

the police pulled up behind him and turned the flashers on

8

or whether the policeman surprised him as he was coming

9

out of the car, neither one of those searches are good

10

under Belton because the man -- it's -- it's no longer

11

appropriate in my judgment to rely -­

12

QUESTION:

That's not what the question

13

presented says.

It says, when the arrestee was not in the

14

car when the police initiated contact with him.

15

MR. DUNHAM:

16

QUESTION:

I understand.

So what I thought you were advocating

17

is if the policeman was not in the car when the police

18

initiated contact with him, unless he's within reaching

19

distance, which he isn't -- if he's not in the car when

20

the police initiated contact with him, then don't apply

21

Belton.

22
23
24
25

MR. DUNHAM:

That's -- that's correct, Your

Honor.
QUESTION:

And that was the line that I was

having trouble figuring out a justification for.

MR. DUNHAM:

That -- that's correct, Your Honor,

and if I might respond.

prongs to it.

10

QUESTION:

The second is that he's
So your

You're saying that Belton never

applies as within reaching -- if he's outside reaching
distance of the car.

11
12

One is that he's in the car when the police

MR. DUNHAM:

If he's -- if he's outside reaching

distance, it doesn't make any sense -­

13

QUESTION:

Okay.

That's -- that's one possible

14

rule.

That would -- that would invalidate what is

15

ordinary police practice in almost every place, which is

16

that they remove him, he's outside the police -- I take it

17

it would.

18

MR. DUNHAM:

19

QUESTION:

Well, it's the moment -­

Can the policeman make him stay

20

within reaching distance?

21

further than that.

22

Wait.

Don't -- don't get any

I want you to stay right there.

MR. DUNHAM:

The policeman can arrest him and

23

take control of him.

24

him stay within reaching distance.

25

So I would argue yes, he can make

The -- the justification for the Belton search

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is to protect the officer.

2

that he's going to effect his arrest at a point that

3

increases the danger to himself just so that he can make a

4

search.

5

QUESTION:

Okay.

It's not reasonable to think

I mean, I understand the

6

argument, and it's been made many times and there's a lot

7

of logic to it.

8

rejected.

9

and -- and maybe it will be accepted or not.

10

But it's been pretty consistently

So -- but I got it.

At least I understand it

But let's put that one aside, the reaching

11

distance point.

Do you want to defend the other

12

distinction your making, which I take it is even if you

13

lose on reaching distance, still Belton does not apply if

14

the initial contact was made between the police and the -­

15

and the suspect outside the car?

MR. DUNHAM:

You want to give up on that one.
No.

Or you want to defend it?
No, no.

Then defend it.
Our -- the initiation of contact we

believe is a -- is a very reasonable test, and we believe

it's called for by the Belton case itself.

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, Your Honor, if you -- if you

think about it, that most -- the most dangerous situation

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for the police officer is when he initiates contact with

2

the person while he's an -- an occupant in an -- of an

3

automobile, but has not yet gotten up to the point where

4

he can get him out and make an arrest.

5

interval between the time that the officer initiates

6

contact with the vehicle and the time when he actually

7

makes a custodial arrest that the danger to the officer is

8

at its greatest point.

QUESTION:

It's during that

Well, that's what -- why I asked

10

doesn't it make sense to say we're not going to initiate

contact while he's in the vehicle, but the minute he gets

12

out, we will arrest him.

13

MR. DUNHAM:

Because in most cases, Your Honor,

14

the officer doesn't have a choice.

You look at the case

15

in New York v. Belton, I mean, he -- the officer was a -­

16

was a State trooper pulling the man over on the highway.

17

The -- when -- when you -- and that's going to be the case

most of the time.

drive off, they want to rush the car and make the arrest

of the occupants.

25

no choice.

And I like to think of it as when you turn on

2

the light to pull the man over, you turn on Belton.

3

Belton comes on when you turn on the red light to signal

4

the man over.

5

And what does it do for the officer?

who is an occupant.

QUESTION:

It

It not only defines who is an

Why -- why don't we save ourselves a

10

lot of trouble and say that in almost all of these cases,

11

the police have an interest in what happens to the

12

vehicle, they're going to take it away anyway, so they

13

might as well do the inventory search right away?

14

MR. DUNHAM:

Well, the -- the Court has come

15

close to entirely extinguishing -- extinguishing any

16

Fourth Amendment protection in a vehicle, and that kind of

17

a decision would give it the final death knell.

18

would be no privacy left.

MR. DUNHAM:

What you end up with, Your Honor,

is when you combine that view with the Court's decisions

in Atwater and Whren, you end up with the police stopping

somebody in -- in a parking lot, maybe a short distance

And that's Justice Ginsburg's point.

Where

And that is a fiction and it is a

11

fiction that courts accept, that if the squad car drives

Unless the police have a practice of

didn't address it.

We believe we would win on

14

Why -- why instead of complicating it

MR. DUNHAM:

Sorry.

Were you finished?

I -- I was just going to finish,

15

Your Honor, by saying that the -- that -- that you might

be inventoried.

So you can't necessarily say that the

QUESTION:

I mean, would it -- do you think it

21

would work -- or why wouldn't work -- to try to control

Belton by imposing limits on what's reasonable time and

reasonable space so that you keep it really to a -- an

24

arrest that took place really when he was just within the

car and not too far away unless it's his fault because he

Now, you'd do that through a common

law approach.

No, no.

You'd have to -- you can't

sometimes efforts to make it clearer make matters worse.

14

So one way to control, in the presence of vague language,

15

is through example.

16

MR. DUNHAM:

And I -- that's what I thought the

17

Court did in Belton was give examples.

And if you follow

18

the examples that were given in Belton, you don't approve

19

the search that occurred with regard to Mr. Thornton,

20

because if you're trying to draw a bright line, which is

what you were trying to do in Belton, you have -- some

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

2
3

MR. GARRE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

4

The sole contention advanced by petitioner on

5

appeal was that the search of his car was not lawful under

6

the rule of New York v. Belton because Officer Nichols did

7

not succeed in initiating contact with him while he was

8

still inside his car.

9

rejected that contention.

10

The court of appeals correctly

To begin with, petitioner's initiation of

11

contact rule has no foundation in the rationale of Belton.

12

It is the fact of the arrest and not the reason that the

13

person exited the car that gives rise to the justification

14

for the Belton search.

15

The custodial arrest is an extremely dangerous

16

and volatile encounter for the officer in the field, and

17

that's particularly true in the case of the arrest of a

18

recent occupant of a vehicle.

19

the generalization that when the recent occupant of a

20

vehicle is arrested, that the inside of the vehicle is

21

always within the area in which that occupant might try to

22

-- try to lunge in order to get a weapon to effect his

23

escape or to grab evidence to conceal it or destroy it in

24

the car.

25

In Belton, this Court drew

Now, the application of that generalization -­

May I just point out that the

question presented in Belton defined it as an occupant of

That's correct, Justice Stevens, but

the Court did use the term recent occupant at page 460 of

its decision.

I -- I

17

Frick case, which is discussed, listed with the cases

discussed at page 459 of the decision, involved the

19

situation where the police came upon the person in a

20

parking lot, and in that situation -- which was one of the

21

cases that the Court identified as the disarray in the

22

case law that existed before Belton.

23

critical point for the Court to understand in weighing the

24

-- the petitioner's reaching distance argument here.

25

I think the

2

context in which the recent occupant of a car is arrested.

3

As the Court mentioned in -- in Belton, it's a world in

4

which there's disarray and confusion in the case law, more

5

litigation and more confusion for the officer in the

6

field.

Belton that that kind of confusion was not helpful to the

police who need clear rules for the scope of their

authority in this context.

The Court noted on page 460 of its decision in

agree with that, but what we're -- what we're looking for

is a clear artificial rule.

MR. GARRE:

No.

That's the purpose of Belton.

I -- I think a rule which -­

QUESTION:

Because the reason it's artificial is

6

it explains that normally Chimel would control, and he

said we want a special rule for -- for arrests of

occupants of cars.

9

and they made it so you can search the entire vehicle.

10

And that's what they did.

That's the other important part of Belton.

11

MR. GARRE:

13

And we -­

But -- but it -­
And the entire -- all -- all

containers in the vehicle I mean.

14

MR. GARRE:

If I could respond in this way.

15

First, the vast majority of arrests that take place in the

16

Belton context, including in this case, including in

17

Belton itself, take place after the person is already

18

outside of the car.

19

QUESTION:

20

Yes, but the contact with the police

is when they're occupants.

21

MR. GARRE:

Well, that's true.

And -- and let

22

me talk, if I could, about the artificiality of that rule

23

and why we think it's not a rule that the Court should

24

adopt.

25

QUESTION:

Well, I'm trying to get an answer to

3

the clearest rule available, and my suggestion to you is

the rule of Belton, as -- as described in Belton itself

I -- I don't think that that is going to be a clearer rule
than the rule that we're asking for in this case.

11

And -- and to respond to your second question as

to what is a recent occupant, in our view it's someone

13

who's just occupied the car.

14

the vast majority of cases in which this question has

15

arisen.

16

met petitioner moments after he exited the car, and that's

been ordered out.

9

QUESTION:

But is -- in other words, geography

is part of the time dimension of recency.

10

MR. GARRE:

Well, and it is in a typical Belton

11

case.

12

Law Enforcement Training Center trains its officers that

13

they should stop their police car within two to four

14

lengths of the vehicle that they're stopping and to pull

15

the person out of the car prior to the arrest.

16

is -- this is the way officers are trained to bring them

17

back because of the inordinate risks that officers face in

18

that situation.

19

If I could give the Court an example.

The Federal

And this

In this case, Officer Nichols intended to pull

20

petitioner over.

That's at page 16 of the J.A., but he

21

didn't succeed in doing so because the petitioner pulled

into a parking lot.

that -- that suspects do if they -- if they feel or sense

The -- the pat-down was a consensual search.

that underlies the search incident to arrest cases which

is --

20

QUESTION:

No, but the -- the point of Justice

21

Stevens' question is why should we go beyond -- strictly

22

why should we go beyond the generalization in Belton?

23

the reason certainly cannot be that this particular guy

24

had a record and had drugs.

25

MR. GARRE:

And

My -- my point, Justice Souter, was

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that the officer safety justification for Belton is going

2

to be squarely implicated regardless of the reason that

3

the person got -- got out of the car.

4

QUESTION:

No, but it seems to me that you get

5

into -- into deeper water if you say that because the -­

6

to me the incoherence of Belton is that it -- it purports

7

to be an application of Chimel with a bright line, but at

8

the point at which the actual search is made, any danger

9

to the officer is over.

And so if -- if you're going to

10

try to justify a -- a more flexible approach to Belton on

11

grounds of the safety justification in Belton, I -- I

12

think you're -- you're out over your head.

13

And -- and the force of Justice Stevens'

14

question to me is this.

15

Chimel.

16

anything other than we're going to have a simple bright

17

line rule for cars and stop all of this litigation.

18

if Belton gave a bright line rule for cars, why is there a

justification for making it less bright by going beyond

Michigan v. Long is another example.

MR. GARRE:

What -- what's

If the hypothetical is the person

10

sees the police officer and races away from the car, the

11

police officer arrests the person in the vicinity of the

12

car, then no, I don't think it matters if he got 15 feet

13

or 20 feet or 30 feet.

If he gets a block away, then

14

sure, it might matter.

These are cases at the outer

15

extreme or margin and aren't implicated by the commonly

recurring fact pattern in which this case arises where the

police meet the person in the same spot that he would have

3

often drive around with white flashing lights on.

4

I'm not sure how the existence of those white flashing

5

lights would come into play under petitioner's initiation

of contact rule.

7

To take an example close to home,

Now,

Take the case that the Court had before it this

8

fall, Arizona v. Gant, which was a case that presented the

9

same issue, but the Court vacated and remanded it in light

10

of the Arizona Supreme Court's decision which rejected the

11

initiation of contact rule.

12

came upon the suspect and he shined a flight -- shined a

13

flashlight into the car which the suspect was still inside

14

the car.

15

him moments later, and yet the court of appeals in that

16

case said that the police officer hadn't sufficiently

17

initiated contact with the suspect while he was still in

the car.

The suspect got out of the car.

MR. GARRE:

Can you search his car?

If the person comes out and is right

13

next to the car in the place he would have been when he

14

had been ordered out, yes, we think that -- that Belton

15

would apply in that situation.

16

But -- but the rule that we're asking the Court

17

to adopt here is that on this fact pattern, which as the

18

court of appeals we think correctly recognized has

19

temporal and spatial limits, where the police see the

20

person exit the car, confront him moments later, the

21

application of the bright line rule in Belton shouldn't

22

depend on the fortuity of whether the police initiate

23

contact with that person beforehand.

24

particularly true in a case like this where Officer

25

Nichols intended to pull the car over and -- and yet

And that's

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

didn't do so because the suspect did what suspects

2

sometimes do, which is to pull over and get out in order

3

to try to blend in.

4

The -- now, going back to the officer safety

5

rationale, we think that is a justification for Belton and

6

that it is implicated in this situation and that the

7

initiation of contact rule would implicate officer safety

8

in a number of ways.

9

One is the surveillance situation that was

10

mentioned during petitioner's argument and that the court

11

of appeals mentioned in this case.

12

officers are engaged in surveillance activities and maybe

13

determine that it's undesirable and unsafe to make contact

14

with a suspect while he's still inside the car and so take

15

the prudent step of waiting for the suspect to step out of

16

the car before confronting him.

17

Virginia, the Glasco case that's discussed in the brief,

18

is an example of that.

19

In -- in some cases,

The -- the case out of

There's -- there's also the -- the possibility,

20

which is recognized in the case law, that an initiation of

21

the contact rule would have the effect of increasing the

22

volatility of Belton encounters by creating a dynamic in

23

which suspects had an incentive to race out of the car

24

before police could -- could initiate contact.

25

QUESTION:

country is for the officer to put the -- the suspect,

4

I have only one factual question here.
Was this car locked before the police officer
searched it?

Did he need the key or do -- do we know?

MR. GARRE:

The -- I believe the answer to that

5

is -- is no because the record doesn't -- what the record

6

shows -- and this is on page 50 of the J.A. I think -- is

7

that the officer arrested petitioner, put him in the car

8

and then went back and searched the car.

9

in the record that suggests that the officer needed keys.

10

There's nothing

But -- but on the inventory search question,

11

although it may be true in some cases that the inventory

12

search inevitably would have led to the discovery of the

13

contraband, in that sense the privacy interests of the

14

person from a Belton search at the time are -- are further

15

diminished.

16

The inventory search I don't think is an answer

17

to the officer's safety concerns and justification for

18

Belton, which are real as long as the person is still at

19

the scene of the arrest.

20

the person can escape and try to get back into the car.

21

There's also the risk, as -- as you mentioned I think,

22

that there could be confederates in the area who might try

23

to get into the car, either for a weapon or to get drugs

24

out of the car or other contraband out of the car.

25

Officers in -- in the Belton stop, it's not uncommon for

There is the remote risk that

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

them to -- to have the person out of the car, to secure

2

him, and then it's only at that point that they -- that

3

they feel safe to go back to make sure that there's no one

4

else in the car who could be hidden in the car or other

5

things in the car.

6

So I -- so we don't think that the inventory

7

search is an answer to the very real concerns that the

8

officers face in conducting the Belton search and that

9

provide the rationale for the Belton search.

10

I wanted to just go back briefly to the Court's

11

decision in Michigan v. Long.

12

in that case on the application of -- of Belton, we do

13

think that it's -- it's persuasive dictum.

14

the police officers saw a car swerve off the road, and

15

they -- they came around back to investigate.

16

petitioner -- or -- or the suspect in that case, the

17

individual who was driving the car, was already outside of

18

the car when the police came back.

19

in that case made quite clear in dictum that if the -- if

20

the suspect in that case had been arrested, that the

21

search of his car would have been perfectly lawful under

22

Belton.

23

persuasive and a correct understanding of Belton.

24
25

And although it is dictum

The only difference is -- is

Would he have to at least see the

6

suspect in the car or would it be all right under the rule

7

you're proposing where the police that come upon the scene

8

just after the suspect exits from the car?

9

MR. GARRE:

Well, we think that the -- the most

10

important thing for the Court to hold in this case -- that

11

we would ask the Court to hold in this case is in the

12

commonly recurring situation where police see the person

13

exit the car and confront him moments later in the same

14

vicinity that he might have occupied if he had been

15

ordered out of the car, that it doesn't make a difference

16

for the purposes of applying Belton as to whether or not

17

the police succeeded in initiating contact or succeeded in

18

initiating contact in a sufficient way.

19

There may be -- there are going to be other

20

cases that arise, and -- and we don't think that this is

dangerous context of an automobile stop.

On the handcuffing in the squad car, I -- I did

not raised by petitioner below, and -- and the court of

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is the situation where the police do see the person get

2

out of the car and do confront him moments later.

3

The -- the States -- a number of States have

4

filed an amicus brief in this case supporting the

5

Government's position and -- and urging against adoption

6

of an initiation of contact rule.

7

it's significant that each of the States and jurisdictions

8

that have adopted the initiation of contact rule, States

9

like Florida and -- and Illinois and Michigan, have signed

10

that brief and urged the Court to reject the initiation of

11

contact rule.

12

It's shown to be unworkable in cases like Gant v. Arizona.

13

And -- and we do think

We think that that rule is unworkable.

There are other cases in which added wrinkles

14

have been applied to the rule.

There's a Florida case,

15

which is not discussed in the briefs, but it is publicly

16

reported.

17

that case, the courts in Florida, applying the initiation

18

of contact rule, concluded that in order to trigger

19

Belton, the contact had to be of a confrontational nature

20

and not of a friendly nature, so that in that case, the

21

courts reversed a conviction for possession of drugs found

22

in a car because the police officer met the person with a

23

application of that rule, but it's nevertheless indicative

of -- of the variations in the line-drawing that can arise

and that have arisen.

4

In this case we think that the court of appeals

properly held that Belton apply.

The record conclusively

shows that petitioner was a recent occupant of the car and

the search was contemporaneous with the -- the arrest, and

we would ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the court

of appeals.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF FRANK W. DUNHAM, JR.

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

14
15
16

MR. DUNHAM:

I have four brief points, Your

Honor, that I'd like to make, if I could.
The first is that the State court opinion in

17

Michigan v. Long, People v. -- People v. Long, shows that

18

the car there was being chased by the police.

19

weren't observing him drive by at a high rate of speed and

20

crash into a ditch.

21

it's reasonable to infer that they had their lights on and

22

therefore had initiated contact.

23

They just

They were in a high-speed chase, and

Furthermore, the State court opinion in People

24

v. Long shows that Long was in the vehicle when the

25

officers got out of their car, after he had crashed into

49

1

the ditch, and began to approach the vehicle.

2

exited his vehicle and walked towards the officers.

3

don't think it's -- it's fair to say that there was no

4

initiation of contact by the officers with Long in the

5

Long case and that the footnote in the Long opinion

6

referencing to Belton is no expansion or further

7

brightening of the Belton rule.

8

Then Long
So I

Second, I want to point out that the Frick case,

9

which is the one possible exception that I think Justice

10

Stevens referred to when he was talking about the cases

11

that Belton points to as defining its class -- the man is

12

either getting into or getting out of his vehicle.

13

not -- he has not achieved the status of pedestrian.

14

people -- I think you could still consider someone who was

15

in the act of either getting in or getting out -- you

16

could call that person an occupant.

17

He has

Third, if you -- the Fourth Circuit did not

18

adopt Mr. Garre's place where he would have occupied if he

19

had been arrested test.

20

Government's might have test.

21

that to what the Fourth Circuit rule and would have him -­

22

and -- and would add a limit that, oh, as long as he's

23

arrested where he might have been if he might have been

24

arrested, if we'd stopped him when he was getting out of

25

his car.

We call -- that's the
But Mr. Garre would add

It seems to me that that is an unworkable rule

1

and it just adds further confusion to the situation.

2

it's necessary, necessary because it's the only way you

3

avoid reversing Chimel.

4

Yet,

Now, the -- the other point I want to make is

5

Justice O'Connor I think made a good point about the

6

inventory search.

7

because in 90 percent of the cases, we're going to have an

8

inventory search anyway?

9

semblance of Fourth Amendment protection in automobiles?

10

Why can't we draw Belton narrowly

And why can't we maintain some

And finally, with regard to the handcuffs point,

11

Mr. Garre's point that people sometimes get out of their

12

handcuffs, I'd simply like to say if we indulge in the

13

presumption that suspects are going to get out of their

14

handcuffs, there's simply no search incident to arrest

15

rule that we can fashion that doesn't just have us

16

searching everyplace on God's green earth.

17

QUESTION:

May I ask you a question -­

18

MR. DUNHAM:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- if your time is up?

In your

20

experience, does an inventory search include the right to

21

search containers in the -- in the car?

22

course, gives the -- the Government the big advantage.

23

You can search every container in the car.

24
25

MR. DUNHAM:

Belton, of

I believe an inventory search does

not allow you to search opaque containers within the car.
