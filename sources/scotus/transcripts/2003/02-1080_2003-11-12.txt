CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Inc. v. Dennis Cline.

Mr. Verrilli.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD B. VERRILLI

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. VERRILLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:

11

The very essence of age discrimination is the

12

disparate treatment of older workers based on the false

13

assumption that productivity and competence decline with

14

old age.

15

protects workers 40 and older from that kind of disparate

16

treatment.

17

workers 40 and older that they have been treated

18

disparately on the basis of their comparative youth.

19

The Age Discrimination in Employment Act

It should not be stretched to cover claims by

QUESTION: Well, Mr. Verrilli, it - perhaps you

20

can say that the language in the statute, because of an

21

individual age - individual's age - is somehow ambiguous.

22

But to what extent do we have to give some deference to

23

the agency position on the thing?

24

is here taking a position contrary to yours based on

25

agency interpretation.

Because the Government

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. VERRILLI: They - they are, Justice O'Connor.

2

That interpretation deserves no deference for three

3

reasons, which I'd like to summarize and then first

4

elaborate on.

5

question - the question of deference is not dependent on

6

whether there's a definitional ambiguity in the - in the

7

specific operative language, in this case of Section

8

623(a), but on what the - what that language means as read

9

in the context of the Act.

The first is that, under Chevron, the

And Chevron says, using all of

10

the traditional tools of statutory construction, and

11

applying that test we submit, as - as I hope to elaborate

12

this morning, one cannot come to the conclusion that there

13

- there - that this statute can be fairly read to

14

authorize the kinds of youth discrimination claims that

15

are at issue here.

16

The second reason, however, is that even if

17

there were - even if there were ambiguity in general,

18

which we submit there is not, under the holding, the

19

express holding in Mead, the - the EEOC's regulation here

20

is not entitled to Chevron deference, and the reason for

21

it is this, and this is at page 227 of the Mead opinion in

22

533 U.S.

23

Mead says, a regulation is entitled to Chevron deference

24

if it is - if it is promulgated in the - if the agency has

25

been given by Congress the authority to promulgate rules

The very sentence that states the holding in

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

with the force of law, and we acknowledge that is true

2

here.

3

But the second half of the test - this is in the

4

statement of the holding in Mead - is that the rule has to

5

be promulgated in an exercise of that authority, and the

6

regulation that the EEOC is here defending today was not a

7

- a rule that was given the force of law by the agency.

8

In fact, the agency made - the Department of Labor, when

9

it initially promulgated this regulation, made a

10

deliberate decision not to promulgate it as a rule with

11

the force of law, but instead to promulgate it solely as

12

guidance to the public about its - about its enforcement

13

authority and it was -

14

QUESTION: How - how do we know that?

15

MR. VERRILLI: Because that is what the

16

Department of Labor said in the Federal Register when it

17

promulgated this.

18
19
20

QUESTION: What - what - what did it say
specifically?
MR. VERRILLI: It said, we are promulgating this

21

as a matter of enforcement guidelines for the - guidance -

22

so the public knows how we intend to enforce the - the -

23

the statute.

It did not promulgate a rule of law.

And

24

then when it was re-promulgated by the EEOC in 1981 - and

25

again, the cites for this are on page 17 of our reply

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

brief - when it was re-promulgated by the EEOC in 1981,

2

the EEOC made a deliberate choice, which it explained in

3

the Federal Register, not to have this be a substantive

4

rule with the force of law, and in fact it did not comply

5

with, and stated it was not going to comply with, the 30-

6

day notice period that is required for substantive rules

7

of law so that -

8

QUESTION: Well, if we could call this an

9

enforcement position or an enforcement policy on the part

10

of the agency, and you're going to probably say we can't -

11

shouldn't call it that - but if we could, doesn't the

12

Government get some deference?

13

deference at all?

14

You say it gets no

MR. VERRILLI: If - well, it would get Skidmore

15

deference, Justice Kennedy, and I think Christensen

16

specifically says that, that it gets Skidmore deference if

17

it's an enforcement guideline and not - and not a - a rule

18

of law - substantive rule of law.

19

applying Skidmore, no deference is due to this regulation

20

principally because it is a regulation that the - that has

21

not been enforced in anything like a consistent manner.

22

To the contrary -

23

But here, Skidmore -

QUESTION: That - that's a different issue, but

24

let's - let's come back to the point of whether it is

25

promulgated as an interpretive regulation or a substantive

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

regulation.

2

substantive regulations are entitled to Chevron deference?

3

MR. VERRILLI: The - the holding in Mead, Justice

4
5
6
7
8
9

You are taking the position that only

Scalia QUESTION: Only - only - only substantive
regulations?

Mead does not say that.

MR. VERRILLI: The - the holding in - the
sentence that's in Mead that says QUESTION: All of the regulations of the SEC, for

10

example, virtually all of them are interpretive

11

regulations.

12

MR. VERRILLI: The question under Mead is whether

13

it was a regulation that was promulgated that - that has

14

the force of law, and they -

15

QUESTION: No, but your - your - point is -

16

QUESTION: That does not equate with

17
18

interpretive.
MR. VERRILLI: Not necessarily.

But here they

19

made a deliberate decision that it wasn't going to have

20

the force of law and they, for example, in 1981 -

21

QUESTION: No, they didn't.

22

promulgated it, on page 17 of your brief, as an

23

interpretation rather than a substantive regulation, and

24

that's what it is.

25

They - they

MR. VERRILLI: Right, right, Justice Scalia.

But

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

they did not comply with the 30-day notice period, which

2

is required -

3
4

QUESTION: You don't have to for - for
interpretive regulations.

5
6

MR. VERRILLI: But for rules with the force of
law you do.

7

QUESTION: For substantive regulations you have

8

to.

You do not have to for interpretive regulations, but

9

that does not mean that an interpretive regulation does

10

not - is not entitled to Chevron deference and is not

11

fully as - as effective as - as laying down the rule of

12

law as a substantive regulation.

13
14

That's never been the -

the rule.
MR. VERRILLI: The question here is whether the

15

agency intended this to be a rule of law or - or guidance

16

of its own enforcement authority, and it - and it clearly

17

intended the latter and it has acted in a manner

18

consistent with the fact that it's the latter and not the

19

former, because it routinely refuses to enforce the

20

principle that the Government is here advocating today.

21

Indeed, in every single instance in which this issue has

22

come before the Department of Labor and the Equal

23

Opportunity - and the EEOC - since the mid-1970's, in

24

every single instance the - the Department of Labor or the

25

EEOC has blessed a - an employment practice that provides

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

comparatively older workers with a benefit not available

2

to workers - to all workers 40 and older so -

3

QUESTION: Mr. - Mr. Verrilli, I - I will assume

4

you're - you're right on the - the application of Mead

5

here, so far as the reg goes.

6

was the 1997 adjudication?

7

What about the - I think it

MR. VERRILLI: The 1997 adjudication, it seems to

8

me, is not something that can give rise to Chevron

9

deference, because that - they were just acting pursuant

10

to their own view of what the - of - of what their - what

11

the statute -

12
13

QUESTION: Wasn't it binding - wasn't it binding
on the parties before them?

14

MR. VERRILLI: It was binding on the parties,

15

Justice Souter, but, of course, even if - if the Court

16

were to conclude that under Mead you get Chevron

17

deference, and I don't think you can for that reason, you

18

still have the problem, in our view, which is the more

19

fundamental problem, which I'd like to address, which is

20

that -

21

QUESTION: Before you leave me, can I just read

22

you two sentences from Mead?

First sentence says, it is

23

fair to assume generally that Congress - that Congress

24

contemplates administrative action with the effect of the

25

law when it provides for a relatively formal

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

administrative procedure, which you say doesn't exist

2

here.

3

notice and comment is in pointing to Chevron authority,

4

the want of that procedure here does not decide the case

5

for we have sometimes found reasons for Chevron deference

6

even when no such administrative formality was required

7

and none was afforded.

8
9

Next sentence, that said, and as significant as

So, as I read that last sentence, I certainly
thought that if Congress so intends, we should give

10

Chevron deference to a rule that has not complied even

11

with notice and comment.

12

MR. VERRILLI: Yes -

13

QUESTION: So I couldn't read Mead as saying you

14
15

have to have that or you don't get the deference.
MR. VERRILLI: But I think the fundamental point

16

for us under Mead, and then I'd like to move back to the

17

main - the Chevron analysis, if I could, but the

18

fundamental point for us under Mead, Justice Breyer, is

19

that the agency made a deliberate decision here not to

20

have this rule be one that was a binding rule -

21

QUESTION: Well, I - I don't know how often an

22

agency says what this agency said here, that we are

23

promulgating this as an indication of how we intend to

24

enforce the law.

25

between rules that are issued with that kind of a

And you're saying there is a chasm

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statement and rules that are issued otherwise.

2

says, in one case, this is the law, and in the other case,

3

this is how we interpret the law.

4

that makes the difference.

5

The agency

I - I don't see that

MR. VERRILLI: I don't see how the agency could,

6

Justice Scalia, think that this had the force of law,

7

because they didn't follow it themselves in the manifold

8

in this decision of which the issue -

9
10

QUESTION: Well, that's - that's a different
point.

11

That's a different point.
QUESTION: Well, isn't - isn't that your - isn't

12

that your stronger point that - that combined with the -

13

the relatively abbreviated procedure, they have, in fact,

14

in a number of instances not followed it and they have

15

never affirmatively, as - as a - as an administrative

16

movement, they have never affirmatively enforced it.

17

Isn't - isn't -

18
19

MR. VERRILLI: That's - that's all correct and we
- I think that does summarize our point more strongly.

20
21
22

QUESTION: Which I think goes to the Chevron
point.
MR. VERRILLI: Going - I agree with that, Justice

23

Souter - but going back to the main question of whether

24

you even get to ambiguity under Chevron, we submit that

25

the answer to that question is no, because Section 623(a)

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is not to be read in isolation.

The fundamental principle

2

of statutory construction is that it needs to be read in

3

context, and the relative contextual indicators here, we

4

submit, foreclose the argument that Congress intended in

5

the ADEA to authorize the kind of youth discrimination

6

claims that are at issue here.

7

QUESTION: Why, Mr. Verrilli, when we have - what

8

is it - 623(f)(2)(B) - that makes an express provision for

9

older worker versus younger worker.

If that were the

10

general interpretation of the statute, then this specific

11

provision relating to an older worker vis-a-vis a younger

12

worker would be unnecessary.

13

MR. VERRILLI: I respectfully disagree with that,

14

Justice Ginsburg, and - and - I'm - I'm looking now at

15

page 3a of the statutory appendix to the Government's

16

brief where the - where provision is located.

17

in the statute, as the preamble to the Older Worker

18

Benefit Protection Act states, to - to provide employers

19

with an affirmative defense to a charge that they have

20

discriminated against comparatively older workers by

21

providing them benefits at a lower level than

22

comparatively younger workers.

23

(B)(i) is

And what - what (B)(i) says, which I take it is

24

the provision Your Honor is referring to, is that, in that

25

situation, even though the comparatively older worker is

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

being disfavored, the comparatively older worker has an

2

affirmative defense, if the older worker can - if the

3

employer can show that the - that it spent as least as

4

much on the benefit for the older worker as it did for the

5

younger worker, even if the benefit is less, and so that -

6
7
8

QUESTION: Well, does that provision cover your
situation, do you think, here?

9

MR. VERRILLI: We - we -

10
11

QUESTION: I mean, could you fit yourself, your
client's situation, under that provision?

12
13

MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice O'Connor.
shoehorn ourselves into that provision.

14
15

QUESTION: And why - is that still pending in the
court below, that argument?

16
17

We can

MR. VERRILLI: It is - it is still pending in the
court below.

18

That's correct, Your Honor.

QUESTION: So, no matter what we do, you would

19

take the position that that provision will cover this

20

case?

21

MR. VERRILLI: We do think so, Your Honor.

Of

22

course, the respondents won't agree with that, I'm quite

23

sure, and I - and I don't think that that's going to solve

24

the many problems that the Sixth Circuit's decision gave

25

rise to here.

For example -

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: Well, that - that's my next point.

2

The - the briefs try to tell us that there's going to be

3

cataclysmic consequences if we don't rule your way.

4

safe harbor provision gives very substantial protection

5

against that, does it not, or - or does it?

6

This

MR. VERRILLI: Yeah - let - if I - I think it

7

gives some protection, not complete protection, but I

8

think there are a whole range of other negative

9

consequences, Your Honor, that I'd like to address, if I

10

could, and then - and I will certainly directly address

11

the safe harbor provision.

12

First, there are a number of employment

13

practices out there where the nation's major employers

14

have engaged in efforts to retain older segments of the

15

workforce and to bring back elderly citizens back into the

16

workforce by doing such things as providing for workers

17

over a certain threshold age, very often 55, the ability

18

to work part-time rather than full-time, to have flex-

19

time schedules, to have - to have jobs that don't involve

20

travel.

21

privileges of employment for people over a certain age to

22

keep them in the workforce.

23

They've changed the terms, conditions, and

The safe harbor here applies only to benefits,

24

Justice Kennedy, and therefore, would not protect that

25

kind of behavior, and although the United States talks

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

about the safe harbor with respect to benefits, I would

2

point out the brief of the United States is notably silent

3

on the question of whether the interpretation being

4

advocated here would make illegal that kind of conduct.

5

And we submit it would because it clearly prefers the

6

comparatively older to the comparatively younger with

7

respect to terms, conditions, and privileges of

8

employment, so -

9

QUESTION: Has the EEOC taken an enforcement

10

position with reference to some of the practices you've

11

just -

12

MR. VERRILLI: Yeah.

13

QUESTION: - or - or non-enforcement positions?

14

MR. VERRILLI: Yes, yes, they have.

15

DOL and EEOC letters which approve those practices, but

16

it's hard to see how one could possibly approve those

17

practices consistent with an interpretation of Section

18

623(a) that imposed a rigid rule of equality for everyone

19

40 and over.

20

There are

QUESTION: One of the amicus briefs pointed to a

21

number of Internal Revenue Code provisions and ERISA

22

provisions that appear to be implicated if you go with the

23

Sixth Circuit view here, and perhaps would be in

24

opposition to the interpretation, given the language -

25

MR. VERRILLI: Yes -

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION: - by the Sixth Circuit.

Now, have you

commented on those various provisions?

3

MR. VERRILLI: We have, Justice O'Connor, and

4

this is actually the second category of adverse effect, it

5

seems to me, that you have if the - if this decision

6

stands and if the rule of law is what the - what the

7

Government advocates.

8

detailed quite effectively in the ERISA Committee brief,

9

provide for - for things such as employees with - employee

Many of those provisions, which are

10

stock option plans, ESOP plans, are allowed, once they

11

become 55 years old, to diversify their stock holdings.

12

Employees, when they retire at 59-1/2 can withdraw money

13

from their retirement plans without facing the tax

14

penalty.

15

There are a host of provisions like that.
One point to be made is that it seems to me

16

irreconcilable with the existence of those provisions to

17

interpret 623(a) this way, but the other point my - my

18

friends the respondents say, yeah, but you don't have to

19

worry about that because the rule that the later-enacted

20

statute governs over the former-enacted statute will take

21

care of it.

22

reason.

23

in the - in the ERISA Committee brief, were statutes that

24

Congress enacted before 1990, and I submit that 1990 is

25

the relevant date for the later-enacted statute, because

I'm afraid that's not so for the following

All of the examples I just gave, and many others

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it has - has - that's the - the Older Worker Benefit

2

Protection Act was passed after Betts and it was passed in

3

1990, and it was that statute that made the ADEA

4

applicable for the first time to fringe benefits of the

5

kind that those regulations govern.

6

So you have a serious problem, at a very

7

minimum, with respect to all of those regulations, it

8

seems to me -

9

QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, what do you do with

10

Section 623(e), which prohibits any advertising by an

11

employer indicating any preference, limitation,

12

specification, or discrimination based on age?

13

there could not possibly mean what you say it means in

14

623(a), that is, old age, because then it would just

15

prohibit preferring older people.

16

means then?

Now, age

So what do you say it

17

MR. VERRILLI: Well, I say -

18

QUESTION: It means young -

19

MR. VERRILLI: I - I -

20

QUESTION: In (a) it means old age and in (e) it

21
22

means young age?
MR. VERRILLI: I have a lot to say about it,

23

Justice Scalia.

The first thing is this: The critique

24

that the Government levels at us with respect to that

25

provision is equally applicable to their interpretation.

What they say is that, you know, if it were lawful under

2

the statute to grant a preference for old age - it doesn't

3

make any sense to say that's it not lawful to advertise

4

for old age - of course, what - if - if age means

5

chronological age here, then you wouldn't be able to state

6

a preference for chronological age in an advertisement,

7

even though it would be perfectly lawful substantively to

8

have a policy that said you're going to open positions to

9

only people 40 or older.

10

So I don't think they get any mileage out of

11

that - out of that, because I think they've got the same

12

kind of linguistic difficulty that we have here with

13

respect to it.

14

Scalia, is -

15

And I think what that shows, Justice

QUESTION: No, but it - it still has some meaning

16

and some beneficial effect with their interpretation,

17

whereas with your interpretation of age, it has no

18

conceivable beneficial effect.

19

as meaning young age and you read it in (a) as meaning old

20

age.

21

You have to read it there

MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think you could read it as

22

meaning old age, but I think the truth of the matter is

23

that the word age is something of a chameleon.

24

word that is very sensitive to context and it's going to

25

have somewhat different connotations throughout this

It's a

18
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statute, and I think it's quite clear that it does.

It's

2

a different connotation, for example, in Section B of the

3

statement of findings and purposes, where it's quite clear

4

that Congress is not talking about chronological age.

5

has a different connotation in the seniority provision,

6

which you can find at page 3a of the Government's

7

statutory appendix, which talks about involuntary

8

retirement, down near the bottom of the page, that an

9

employer's plan cannot require the involuntary retirement

10

of any individual specified by subsection 631 of this

11

title because of the age of such individual.

12

It

Now, in a sense, that means chronological age,

13

but not in the sense that my friends on the other side say

14

about 623(a), because what it means really is once you've

15

become old enough that you've bumped up against the age

16

limit, and there are other provisions in 623 in which age

17

functions in exactly that way.

18

think this really is a case like Robinson against Shell

19

Oil, where the word employee takes on different

20

connotations in different sections, like - like Scheidler,

21

where the word enterprise in the various subsections of

22

RICO takes on different connotations depending on exactly

23

how it's being used.

24

different connotations in different sections in the

25

statute.

I just don't think - I

I think the word age here takes on

1

QUESTION: You must have thought of this and

2

tried it out.

It doesn't work, but as I was reading it I

3

thought perhaps individual might refer to older

4

individual.

5

MR. VERRILLI: Well, I think - I -

6

QUESTION: If - I mean, but that must not, but

7
8
9

I'm sure - why didn't it work?

Because if you - if you -

if you have - if you read individual throughout - cite
(1)(a)(i) is older individual.

The only place it has bite

10

is where you get to the end, because of such older

11

individuals -

12

MR. VERRILLI: I think - we've thought about it

13

in this sense, Justice Breyer, and I think it dovetails

14

what I - what I think is our key contextual point, which

15

is that statute only protects people 40 and older, and if

16

what Congress was concerned about was a rule that

17

precluded arbitrary discrimination in favor of the

18

comparatively old as well as the comparatively young, it's

19

an exceedingly strange thing to do to draw a line at age

20

40, because, of course, people under 40 are much more

21

likely to be subject to discrimination on the ground that

22

they're comparatively too young than are people over 40.

23

QUESTION: I - I thought it was a big deal when

24
25

you had your 40th birthday, I mean (Laughter.)

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. VERRILLI: Not anymore, Your Honor.

2

(Laughter.)

3

QUESTION: But is it -

4

MR. VERRILLI: But in any -

5

QUESTION: - isn't the - isn't the answer to - to

6

the - to the argument that you've just made is that as -

7

as a general proposition, anything that in effect

8

interrupts or skews employment for somebody over the age

9

of 40 is very difficult for somebody over the age of 40 to

10

deal with, regardless of which way the discrimination is

11

working?

12

people, and that's why it would make sense for - for the -

13

for the interpretation that - that was being suggested, to

14

draw the line at 40.

15

That is not as a general rule true of younger

MR. VERRILLI: I - I think - I think that's the -

16

the best statement of the argument on the other side and

17

I think it's the Government's effort to defend the line on

18

that basis, but I don't think it works, because the reason

19

that people 40 and over have a problem once they suffer an

20

adverse employment action - and the Government itself

21

acknowledges this in its argument - is because they are

22

then subject to discrimination on the ground that they

23

perceive - they are perceived as being too old.

24

the problem, and that's the only problem the Government

25

has been able to identify that people 40 and over suffer

That's

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is that kind of -

2

QUESTION: Well, the 41-year-olds are perceived

3

as being too old in relation to people less than 41, and

4

it still means that when somebody looks at a 41-year-old,

5

they - the 41-year-old is just not as attractive an

6

employee as somebody, you know, a year - a year younger or

7

two years younger.

8
9

MR. VERRILLI: Yes, Justice Souter.

I think

that's true, but - but 623(a) isn't an all-purpose

10

prohibition of arbitrary employment decisions respecting

11

people 40 and over, and after all, that same kind of

12

critique could be made of - if an employee is fired

13

because they're not fit enough or they have the wrong

14

color hair or -

15

QUESTION: Mr. Verrilli, it does - what Justice

16

Souter suggested does fit with the comment of Senator

17

Yarborough that was put out, that said that the 42-year-

18

old would have a claim if the 52-year-old were preferred,

19

say, for hiring or promotion.

20

MR. VERRILLI: It - it does.

That's the only

21

thing in the voluminous history of this - of this

22

enactment and all of its amendments that provides any

23

support for the Government's view here in response, but it

24

- and it - but it does provide some support for that, I

25

agree.

But I really think -

1

QUESTION: The - the part of your explanation

2

about the - the diminished hurt to the 40-year-old was

3

within the - was within the universe of society as a

4

whole, but within the context of his own or her own

5

company, this is hurtful.

6

who have younger children being educated and so forth, and

7

if they find discrimination within their company, it

8

doesn't help much for you to say, well, society as a whole

9

doesn't discriminate against.

10

These are people at that age

MR. VERRILLI: I think - I think, Justice

11

Kennedy, that it's - it's important to go back to the

12

source for this statute to understand what Congress was

13

trying to do, the circumstances of enactment of this

14

statute.

15

when it passed Title VII, or in 1967, when it enacted this

16

statute, simply have put the word age into Title VII and

17

had it operate in exactly the same manner Title VII does.

18

But it made a deliberate choice not to do that.

19

After all, Congress could have, either in 1964,

The reason it did, I submit, is because the

20

recommendations of the Secretary of Labor in response to

21

the directive of Congress were that the problem of age

22

discrimination in the workplace is fundamentally different

23

than the problem of - than the problems that were

24

addressed by Title VII.

25

this, that the - the kinds of discrimination that Title

And the critical difference is

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

VII addressed was discrimination on the basis of

2

characteristics that are always irrelevant to a decision

3

about who should be hired, fired, or promoted, or demoted.

4

And what the Secretary of Labor said is that age is

5

different, the age is not always irrelevant, age

6

distinctions are not always arbitrary, and I submit the

7

Court - the opinion for the Court in Betts identified

8

exactly that principle, that this is a different kind of

9

problem warranting a different kind of solution.

10

The problem was that there are stereotypes that

11

exist that - that - on which employers act that - that

12

prospective employees are - don't have the competence or

13

the productivity to handle a job because they are too old,

14

and that was the problem that this statute tried to

15

address and it's why it tried to address it in such a

16

fundamentally different manner than Title VII.

17

makes all the difference here.

18

the Court really did recognize that in Betts.

19

Kennedy, in Betts, you had the operative language

20

privileges - terms, conditions, and privileges of

21

employment, identical in Title VII to - and the ADEA.

22

Context

Again, and - and I think
Justice

But what the Court concluded in Betts was that

23

that language had a different meaning.

In Title VII it

24

included fringe benefits.

25

fringe benefits, and the reason for that was because

In the ADEA it did not include

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reading the provision not in isolation, but in the context

2

of the rest of the statute, it was quite clear that Title

3

- that the ADEA was meant to address a different kind of

4

problem, and that there was age-based decision-making that

5

was appropriate and not invidious and that ought not to be

6

prohibited by law.

7

based decision-making that's at issue in this case is

8

precisely the kind of age-based decision-making that

9

Congress did not want to make unlawful.

10

And I submit that the kind of age-

And the reason for this is quite - is quite

11

simply that people at the end of their working lives are

12

in a different position, especially with respect to

13

retirement security measure, which is what at issue - is

14

at issue here, even than a 41-year-old, someone else in

15

the protected class.

16

General Dynamics did here, with the union, to come up with

17

a solution that protected them from a harsh outcome and

18

protected their reliance interests, it's simply not

19

anything remotely within the contemplation of Congress

20

when it - when it - in the prohibitory - prohibitory

21

sections of the ADEA.

22

And so when an employer acts, as

If the Court -

QUESTION: Do we know the numbers, Mr. Verrilli?

23

We have, I think, some 200 people in the class that's

24

suing the 40 to 49-year-old.

in the 50 -

How many were grandfathered

MR. VERRILLI: I - I believe it's - I believe

2

it's a comparable number, but I have to confess, Your

3

Honor, I don't know for sure what the exact number is.

4

the Court has no further questions, I'd like to reserve

5

the balance of my time.

Mr. Biggerman, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARK W. BIGGERMAN
ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

10
11

If

MR. BIGGERMAN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:

12

The real issue here is whether this Court should

13

add an additional element to the ADEA's prohibition

14

language.

15

prohibits discrimination against individuals 40 years old

16

or older because of their age, not because of their older

17

age.

18

language to require that individuals 40 and older also be

19

relatively older than any other group of employees with

20

whom they -

21

And the answer, we submit, is no.

The ADEA

Petitioner would have this Court change that

QUESTION: Mr. Biggerman, how do you deal with

22

the relaxed physical tests for, say, 50 or over?

As Mr.

23

Verrilli mentioned, the flex-time, the reduced hours for

24

people who are well over 40 - 55, say, so that the - could

25

- could the 40 to 55 age group then sue because they have

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to meet in full the physical fitness requirements, they

2

can't have the flex-time, they can't have the reduced

3

hours?

4

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, those are encompassed

5

in affirmative defenses.

6

simply whether the respondents have a cause of action.

7

What we are asserting here is

QUESTION: So is your answer yes, that would be

8

discrimination?

9

prohibited discrimination under this Act to make those

10

special accommodations to older workers?

11
12

It might be a defense but it would be

MR. BIGGERMAN: That would be prohibited subject
to an affirmative defense.

13

QUESTION: What would the affirmative defense be?

14

MR. BIGGERMAN: For example, a bona fide

15

occupational qualification.

16

QUESTION: Why in the world would that be a BFOQ?

17

You don't have to be over 55 to do the job, quite the

18

contrary.

19

they're able to do the job.

decision that I know.

applicational definition of BFOQ, bona fide occupation

22

qualification essential to the job.

23

Special accommodations are being made so that
It doesn't fit with any BFOQ

It's a very extraordinary

QUESTION: So what happens is that a piece of

24

legislation that everybody thought was meant to aid older

25

workers, especially those towards the end of their working

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

careers, ends up harming them.

2

make special arrangements to let them do flex-time.

3

can't make these accommodations - a very strange

4

consequence of this legislation.

5

You - you - you cannot
You

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, we - we - we submit

6

that Congress set forth specific examples as to when there

7

are exceptions that can be made.

8
9

QUESTION: But do you have - the exceptions are
in the statute.

You gave me the BFOQ, I think it's quite

10

clear that that wouldn't work in this case.

11

would be?

12

discrimination.

13

against it?

14

the employer an affirmative defense?

15

What else

We have, as you said, this would be
How could the employer then defend

What is there in the statute that would give

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, what would give the

16

employer an affirmative defense to have, as you said, a

17

more - to permit - if you could repeat the example?

18

QUESTION: To make special accommodations to

19

older workers, no physical fitness test, shorter hours,

20

flex-time, and that's not available to people who are

21

under 55, say.

22

MR. BIGGERMAN: Well, I - I think that - let me

23

expand a little on my answer.

I think that Congress' goal

24

here was to make age a neutral factor in employment.

25

I don't think that Congress intended to permit any special

Now,

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

considerations for age unless they're set forth in the

2

statute.

3

QUESTION: But what about all the sections in

4

ERISA and in the Internal Revenue Code that allow various

5

provisions for benefit plans, for retirement, and for

6

stock option exercise and so forth that are going to be at

7

odds with your interpretation.

8

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor -

9

QUESTION: I mean, there are a whole array of

10

laws that will be directly affected if the Sixth Circuit

11

view is affirmed.

12

you think Congress really intended such a result?

13

Now, what do we do about all that?

Do

MR. BIGGERMAN: I don't think that the ADEA

14

conflicts with those provisions because a cause of action,

15

unlike in this case, 12(b)(6), this case should not have

16

been dismissed, it should have been allowed to go forward.

17

And in the employer - in any situation which those

18

regulations or those statutory provisions under some other

19

law - IRS -

20

QUESTION: One thing - I see that point - that

21

one thing that everybody, I think, is saying in one form

22

or another, is one thing that isn't covered in 2 is hiring

23

and firing people.

24

person over the age of 40, he will either be hit with a

25

lawsuit by the older one, or if he tries to lean over a

So every time an employer dismisses a

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

little backwards in favor of the older - and I don't want

2

to be too prejudiced in favor of the older though I am in

3

that category - the - the point is that every time he then

4

tries to be at all sympathetic to the older person, the

5

younger one hits him with a lawsuit.

6

And so what the Federal courts become is an

7

employment court to discover in each instance whether

8

there was cause, and moreover, no employer could possibly

9

lean over even a little bit favorable towards an older

10
11

person, and that's why I think what we're saying is your I would say it - your interpretation will blow up this

12

Act, destroy it.

An Act that was intended to help older

13

people will now suddenly become an Act which turns Federal

14

courts into labor courts, deciding in each case that

15

anything happens to a person over the age of 40, whether

16

the employer was or was not justified.

17

- I'm putting it strongly, but I want to hear what I think

18

they're telling you on the other side, which is what I

19

thought I was articulating.

Now - now that is

20

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I would - I would

21

analogize that to this Court's decision in McDonald v.

22

Santa Fe, when, prior to that in McDonnell Douglas, this

23

Court said - set forth the first prima facie requirement

24

as requiring a minority under Title VI.

Yet in McDonald

25

v. Santa Fe it said no because of sex.

That is when you

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

can sue like in the Age Act.
QUESTION: Well, that - that brings me back to

3

the answer you gave to Justice Ginsburg's question and it

4

was again reflected in Justice Breyer's.

5

inferring from your answer - I don't think you said it

6

quite this way - that in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical

7

regarding flex-time and - and no physical fitness test,

8

you would say that there is a violation there?

9

what I carry away from your - from your answer to her, and

10

that directly relates to Justice Breyer's concern that he

11

just expressed.

12

Am I correct in

That's

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I must - I must

13

humbly confess that I don't have a grasp of the entire

14

statute in every situation in every regulation.

15

this moment I did.

16

answer, that Congress intended to make age neutral, and if

17

there were no exception, no exemption in the statute or no

18

regulation that provided an affirmative defense, then that

19

would be impermissible if it was based on age.

20

I wish at

But I would give you the general

QUESTION: Now, I - I have to tell you that -

21

that as currently advised, that seems to me so fanciful a

22

version of what Congress intended that I would not

23

interpret the statute that way.

24

you if you can tell me that, with respect to this

25

ambiguous statute, I am bound by Chevron or Mead to - to

Now, I will go along with

accord deference to the agency's interpretation.

2

your - the people on the other side say that there's no

3

such requirement.

here?

that deference is QUESTION: What are you relying on?

The agency

guideline?

9
10

Do you think there is a requirement

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I definitely think

7
8

Your -

MR. BIGGERMAN: 1625.2 of the interpretive
guideline.

Is that what you're referring to?

11

QUESTION: Yes.

12

MR. BIGGERMAN: Yes, which was also supported by

13

the agency adjudication in the 1997 adjudication, which

14

was confirmed by the entire commission, which is the only

15

-

16

QUESTION: Do - do you agree with the description

17

of the other side that that was not promulgated by notice

18

and comment rule-making?

19
20
21

MR. BIGGERMAN: It was my understanding that the
EEOC promulgated it by notice and comment.
QUESTION: Yes, but they said that they did it

22

simply to go along with the Carter administration's

23

request or requirement that even interpretive rules be

24

promulgated by notice and comment rule-making even though

25

the ADA does not require that.

Now, that's what they

actually wrote in their brief, and is that accurate?
MR. BIGGERMAN: It's - it's my understanding that
that is accurate.
QUESTION: All right.

If that is accurate, why

5

would Congress have intended, and the relevant pages of

6

Mead use the word Congress in one paragraph five times to

7

try to figure out what Congress wanted in this respect,

8

why would Congress have wanted the courts to defer to this

9

kind of interpretive regulation, which if it's taken

10

seriously would destroy Congress' own ends?

11

pretty tough question.

That's a

12

MR. BIGGERMAN: It is.

13

QUESTION: I'm putting it - I'm overstating these

14
15

slightly because I want to elicit clear answers from you.
MR. BIGGERMAN: I - I - it's not my belief that

16

this goes against Congress' intentions.

17

Congress set out to set forth specific exemptions,

18

including the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, in

19

which there are instances when older workers can be

20

favored, and so therefore I don't think it went against

21

Congress' intention.

22

Protection Act set forth a whole bunch of additional

23

exemptions after this regulation was already in place.

25

I think the

I mean, the Older Workers Benefit

QUESTION: Mr. Biggerman, may I ask you two
questions?

The first question is, when was the statute

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

enacted?

2

MR. BIGGERMAN: The ADEA?

3

QUESTION: Yes.

I think the sponsor of the

4

statute, the Secretary of Labor, was a former law

5

professor of mine, so I think it goes back quite a ways.

6

(Laughter.)

7

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I - I think you're

8
9
10

right.
QUESTION: Well, it's a good many years ago,
wasn't it?

11

MR. BIGGERMAN: It was a good many years ago.

12

QUESTION: And the second question is, what -

13

what is your comment on this sentence in the district

14

court's opinion: Every Federal court to address the issue

15

has held that a claim of reverse age discrimination is not

16

cognizable under ADA.

17

history of viewing the statute in one - one way and that

18

perhaps there are substantial reliance interests out there

19

that would build up over a period of many, many years.

20

Would you comment on that aspect of the case?

21

This suggests that there's a long

MR. BIGGERMAN: I - that statement by the

22

district court was incorrect.

The decision in the

23

Mississippi Light - Mississippi Power and Light decision

24

had been rendered before the district court's decision and

25

that was at least one decision that -

2

QUESTION: When was that case decided?
shortly before the district court's decision?

3
4

Just

MR. BIGGERMAN: No, Your Honor, it was a little
bit before that and I'm looking for the cite.

5

QUESTION: Well, isn't it true though, as a

6

general matter, the courts had generally read the statute

7

the way the district court read it?

8

MR. BIGGERMAN: As - as a - see, Your Honor,

9

Hamilton came out and then all of the district courts

10

followed the Seventh Circuit's decision in Hamilton

11

without really interpreting the ADEA.

12

followed that.

13

the body did go in that direction, but simply relied on

14

the Hamilton -

15

They just simply

So, yes, there is a body.

The majority of

QUESTION: But do you think that the - the

16

business community has - was justified in relying on that

17

rule for a good many years?

18
19

MR. BIGGERMAN: I don't think so, Your Honor.

I

think in light of the EEOC -

20

QUESTION: You think the statute's so clear?

21

MR. BIGGERMAN: The statute and the EEOC -

22

QUESTION: The EEOC during all this period

23

continued to say that - that it worked both ways, didn't

24

it?

25

MR. BIGGERMAN: Not in its only binding opinion.

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In its only binding opinion it followed the language of

2

1625.

3
4
5

The letters, the opinion letters by the Secretary -

the Department of Labor - and the EEOC before, those
aren't binding.

The binding -

QUESTION: Well, the question isn't whether

6

they're binding.

7

community could rely on them.

8

your - you have this guideline out there, this regulation,

9

I would say, and incidentally I don't know why you accept

10

the proposition that interpretive regulations are somehow

11

different from substantive regulations insofar as their

12

authoritativeness is concerned, but you have the

13

regulation out there, but you have the agency saying to

14

the business community in an opinion letter, don't worry

15

about it, we're not going to enforce it that way, and

16

indeed we're going to amend the regulation.

17

know, what - what - what am I to make about that as far as

18

Chevron deference is concerned?

19

The question is whether the business
I mean, here are your -

Now, you

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, I would - I would ask

20

that you look at the top at the commission and what they

21

did in the binding opinion, and I think that is what is

22

entitled to Chevron deference.

23

QUESTION: But the - the regulation itself seems

24

to have some internal tension, if not inconsistency,

25

because what you're relying on is what it says in

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

1625.2(a) and then (b) goes on to say, but the extension

2

of additional benefits, such as increased severance pay to

3

older employees within the protected group, may be lawful

4

when the employer has a reasonable basis to conclude that

5

those benefits will counteract problems related to age

6

discrimination.

7

the older you get, the more problems you have, and so if

8

you can - if this - this regulation says, yes, you can

9

give benefits.

10

That seems to be just a recognition that

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, again I would come

11

back to the - the statement that in order to fulfill the

12

requirements set forward in (b), a reasonable basis, you

13

need facts.

14

have here.

15

action.

16

defense to defend its action.

17

That's an affirmative defense, which we don't
That goes above and beyond a simple cause of

The employer could use that as an affirmative

QUESTION: Not unless there's a law allowing it.

18

I don't see one.

I mean, there is no provision unless you

19

shoehorn it under this (B)(i) section, that allows any out

20

for the employer, is there?

21

MR. BIGGERMAN: I - I don't understand.

22

QUESTION: For the employ - well, I'm taking up

23

your time.

24

don't see a provision allowing the affirmative defense.

25

You have only a few minutes left.

I just

MR. BIGGERMAN: Am I to understand you, Justice

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

O'Connor, that you don't see a provision in the statute

2

that allows the same affirmative defense as in this

3

regulation?

4

again, it's the EEOC interpreting the Act.

5

know, a statute doesn't cover every instance.

6

answer your question or would you like me to go -

That's correct.

This - this is outside, but

7

QUESTION: Go ahead.

8

MR. BIGGERMAN: Okay.

9

As we all
Does that

I - I would just like to

say that the Age Discrimination Act, the prohibition

10

language says, because of age, and this Court has before,

11

in Consolidated Coin, ruled that the fact that one

12

individual loses out to another individual within the

13

protected class, it doesn't matter.

14

whether the individual loses out because of age.

15

that's the critical thing here.

16

It's because - it's
That -

The -

QUESTION: The example that's given in the paper

17

is the - the 51-year-old and a 42-year-old are both

18

applying for a job and no matter which one gets it you

19

can't discriminate on account of age.

20

decision to employ the 51-year-old be a discrimination on

21

account of age?

22

mind if it's an age-based decision?

23
24
25

How could a

What - what would be in the employer's

MR. BIGGERMAN: Your Honor, are you asking me for
an example as to why someone might want to hire QUESTION: How - how could that - how could that,

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

within the meaning of the statute, be a discrimination on

2

account of age if they hired the older person?

3

MR. BIGGERMAN: Congress found that at age 40 and

4

over any discrimination on the basis of age injures the

5

individual.

6

QUESTION: But the decision to hire the older

7

person, how could that be a - would it have to be just the

8

unique situation where the employer doesn't like 42-year-

9

olds?

10

MR. BIGGERMAN: Well, it - there may be - the

11

employer may want a situation where they want the prestige

12

of having someone with gray hair as opposed to less gray

13

hair for a consultant position or for a television

14

anchorman.

15

QUESTION: Well, that wouldn't be discrimination

16

on the basis of age.

17

Some young people have gray hair.

18
19

QUESTION:

You just like gray-haired people.

They'd be just in favor of gray-

haired people, yeah.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MR. BIGGERMAN: But - but if - if they had a

22

requirement in their policy that it had to be only 51 or

23

older -

24

QUESTION: Well, it's -

25

MR. BIGGERMAN: Right.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

2

QUESTION: You could be 51 and still have dark
hair.

Some of us -

3

(Laughter.)

4

QUESTION: Maybe they're moved by humanity, or is

5

that an unfortunate thing to take into account in the law?

6

MR. BIGGERMAN: It - it is not, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION: So maybe they want to keep this older

8

person around because it's the decent thing to do -

9

MR. BIGGERMAN: But the statute -

10
11
12

QUESTION: - and then the younger person comes in
and sues.
MR. BIGGERMAN: The statute prohibits

13

discrimination on the basis of age.

It just simply sets

14

the protected class at 40 and over.

That's our argument.

15

If there are no further questions.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

19

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

20

SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS

21
22

MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:

23

Absent an affirmative defense, the Age

24

Discrimination in Employment Act prohibits discrimination

25

on the basis of age against members of the protected class

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and is not limited to claims brought by the older members

2

of the class.

3

QUESTION: Mr. Clement, now, Justice Ginsburg

4

gave some examples of employment practices that favor

5

older persons, for which I don't think there's an

6

affirmative defense.

7

Am I correct that there isn't?

MR. CLEMENT: There's no affirmative defense in

8

the statute, Justice Stevens, and let me address those

9

hypotheticals, because I think these seemingly benevolent

10

instances of using age may be beguiling, but I think in

11

reality even those benevolent uses of age implicate the

12

interests and concerns of the Age Act.

13

an employer who's willing to exempt employees over 50 from

14

a physical fitness test.

15

ask is, if you're willing to exempt workers over 50 from

16

the physical fitness test, is the physical fitness test

17

really a legitimate occupational qualification?

18

should that be used to exclude workers between 40 and 50

19

from the workplace?

20

Take, for example,

Well, the first question I would

And

QUESTION: Let's take the hours because you

21

certainly couldn't use that claim that that - that maybe

22

you didn't need this test.

23

necessarily screens out the older workers, but the

24

employer doesn't want to put them through the strain of

25

the test.

The claim isn't that it

But let's - let's move to the flexible hours,

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reduced work hours, we're not going to give those benefits

2

to younger people within the protected class, only 50 and

3

over.

4

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, it seems to me

5

that stereotypes that older workers are going to be more

6

strained and can't work as hard and need time off are

7

precisely the stereotypes the Act is designed to prohibit.

8

Now, it's different if a worker -

9

QUESTION: Well then, how - how in the world

10

could the agency then adopt 1625.2(b) that allows

11

increased benefits to older workers if the employer can

12

show that those older people have more problems?

13

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Ginsburg, 1625.2(b) is

14

limited to benefits, and Charles Shaner, who's the general

15

counsel of the EEOC at the time that the Older Worker

16

Benefit Protection Act was passed, explained that the

17

statutory affirmative defense that would be implicated

18

here on remand, 623(f)(2)(B)(i), is a simplification of

19

that regulatory defense.

20

general matter does is it recognizes that benefits are

21

more difficult because it's tied up with issues of

22

retirement age and the like, and so a more flexible

23

approach is necessary with respect to benefits.

24
25

And I think what the Act as a

But with respect to core employment, hiring,
firing, promotion, and compensation, the Act reflects a

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

judgement, as stated in the purpose, that they want to

2

promote the employment of older people on the basis -

3

QUESTION: Now, Mr. Clement, just - I want to be

4

sure I have an answer to my question.

With respect to

5

employment practices, such as that described, am I correct

6

in - in agreeing that if an employer uses a stereotype to

7

- to reach that conclusion, there would be no affirmative

8

defense for it?

9

MR. CLEMENT: I - I think that's right.

Unless

10

this Court were, I mean, if this Court has a - has a very

11

flexible view of age in the prohibition, I suppose it

12

could allow the agency to adopt a flexible affirmative

13

defense along the lines of Weber.

Let me also -

14

QUESTION: Why not?

15

MR. CLEMENT: Let me also say that the statute

16

specifically gives the EEOC, in 29 U.S.C. 628, the

17

regulatory authority to make exemptions, and I think if

18

there are specific concerns with particular practices that

19

seem benevolent and are benevolent, then the EEOC can make

20

a regulatory exemption.

21

seemingly benevolent -

But with respect to these

22

QUESTION: Where - where is that authority?

23

MR. CLEMENT: 29 U.S.C. 628.

It's in the

24

statutory appendix, I believe at page 4a, and that - and

25

that is - that is a sweeping authority.

It gives the EEOC

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

both the authority to make interpretive regulations and

2

substantive exemptions from the statute.

3

QUESTION: Well - well if - if your submission is

4

that stereotypes are - are deplored and prohibited by the

5

Act, how could the EEOC make an exemption to the contrary?

6

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think, as I said, if - I

7

think that - that the Act is perfectly consistent with the

8

idea that these stereotypes should play no role.

9

purpose clause of the statute says it wants to promote the

10

employment of older workers, but how does it say it wants

11

to promote the employment of older workers?

12

them judged on their ability rather than age.

13

it reflects a judgement that an employer that has age in

14

mind and not ability when trying to favor an older worker

15

is not going to be able to reverse the process when

16

they're working to the detriment of a worker.

17

The

By having
And I think

QUESTION: So then in any instance in which the

18

employer quite honestly is moved by some human feeling

19

that is related to an older person, that the Act would

20

rule out?

21
22
23

MR. CLEMENT: I - I think that's right, Justice
Breyer, but what's QUESTION: All right.

Now, is there any reason

24

to think that that's what Congress had in mind, any reason

25

to think that it - that it - that it really wanted in this

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

respect, because most human beings are moved by these

2

kinds of emotions, they wanted to prohibit that?

3
4

MR. CLEMENT: Two responses, Justice Breyer.
First -

5

QUESTION: Helps other people.

6

MR. CLEMENT: First, I think that the natural

7

human instinct to favor an older worker would be to cut a

8

break to a worker who's been with the company many years,

9

and if that's what an employer wants to do, it's perfectly

10

free under the Age Act to say, if you've been with us 30

11

years or 20 years, we're going to cut you a break.

12

extent that's not the motivation, but it's purely age-

13

based, then there is an indication in the statutory

14

history, and that indication is the colloquy between

15

Senators -

16
17

QUESTION: I thought that was ambiguous, somewhat
ambiguous.

18
19

To the

MR. CLEMENT: Well, the colloquy is not at all
ambiguous.

20

QUESTION: Who - who heard that colloquy?

21

mean, were they the only two people on the floor?

22

really supposed to get -

I
I'm

23

(Laughter.)

24

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, all I can tell you

25

is that -

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: We don't really know, do we?

2

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, I can tell you

3

this.

The same number of people heard that colloquy as

4

heard the colloquy that this Court relied on between the

5

same two Senators in interpreting the Age Act in Betts and

6

in United Airlines against McMann.

7

Court has recognized that those two Senators have

8

important views on the Age Act because they were the

9

principal sponsors and the floor managers of the bill, and

On two occasions this

10

as the icing on the cake, the Court relied on Senator

11

Javits again in the Criswell case.

But -

12

QUESTION: How - how much use has the EEOC made

13

of Section 628 when it can issue exemptions or that sort

14

of thing?

15

MR. CLEMENT: Mr. Chief Justice, I don't know the

16

exact number of times, but I know there is a pending

17

exemption right now that's been - that's been promulgated

18

-

19
20
21

QUESTION: Are there - are there - are there
other exemptions that have actually been granted?
MR. CLEMENT: There - there are, Mr. Chief

22

Justice, and the one that they're working on now is to

23

give employers greater flexibility to coordinate their

24

retirement benefits with Medicare benefits in response to

25

a Third Circuit decision in the Erie County case -

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

QUESTION: Well, may I ask -

2

MR. CLEMENT: - so that's not just statutory

3

authority that's never been used.

4

QUESTION: May I ask you a similar question?

To

5

what extent has - how many enforcement proceedings has the

6

EEOC commenced to - to enforce the reverse discrimination

7

aspect of this statute?

8
9

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, there's one time
where they did enforce it and that was a full committee

10

proceeding.

11

commission, so that is a binding decision on the

12

commission.

13
14

The decision was circulated to the full

QUESTION: So they did - there is one example of
an enforcement action?

15

MR. CLEMENT: Right.

16

QUESTION: In all these years, only one?

17

MR. CLEMENT: Well, but there are only a handful

18

of examples that go the other way and with - I think it's

19

important to understand that with respect to the entire

20

universe of EEOC decisions, as opposed to Department of

21

Labor decisions, there's this one decision that comes up

22

in a non-benefits context where they apply the regulation.

23

There are three other decisions that come up in a benefits

24

context -

25

QUESTION: In that - in that very context, Mr.

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Clement, you didn't mention this Court's decision in

2

O'Connor against Consolidated Coin, where was it the 52-

3

year-old had a claim for relief when the 41-year-old was

4

preferred.

5

saying that equally the 41-year-old would have - have a

6

claim if the 52-year-old were preferred?

7

If I understand your argument, you - you are

MR. CLEMENT: That's correct, Justice Ginsburg.

8

That's exactly what the Senate colloquy said that - and

9

that colloquy was picked up in the regulation, which is a

10

binding regulation with notice and comment rule-making.

11

QUESTION: It says in the colloquy -

12

QUESTION: Well, leave - leave - no, please go

13

ahead.

14
15

QUESTION: It says in the colloquy, could not
turn down either.

16

MR. CLEMENT: Right.

17

QUESTION: It doesn't - they were clear, turn

18

There would be -

down either -

19

MR. CLEMENT: Right.

20

QUESTION: - and choose the other.

21
22

It could be -

can't MR. CLEMENT: No.

It said there would be

23

discrimination whichever way the decision went, and I

24

don't think that's all that unusual.

25

the Title VII context that you have an employee who's

fired for sex or race -

2

QUESTION: Whichever way it went, if it was -

3

MR. CLEMENT: - somebody will sue.

4

QUESTION: - whichever way it went, if it was

5

based on age, I still don't understand how one could hire

6

the 51 because he discriminates against 42-year-olds.

7

MR. CLEMENT: I - I think, Justice Stevens, you

8

could have a presumption or a stereotype that older

9

workers are going to be better.

I suppose it's also true

10

that you could have a situation where, for some other

11

benefits reason, an older worker wasn't going to have as

12

many benefits or would get paid less -

13

QUESTION: But the problem with your stereotype

14

argument that the Government's trying to drive out of

15

people's minds age, just the way it's trying to drive out

16

of people's minds race, sex, and the other things against

17

which you can't discriminate, is that the Government

18

doesn't try to drive it out of their minds, it only - only

19

over 40.

20

these - these thoughts of age.

21

regard this statute as a statute that is directed against

22

some moral disapproval of - of taking age into account.

23

Under 40 it's perfectly okay to have these You just simply cannot

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Scalia, the statute, when

24

it was originally enacted, had the protected class only

25

between 40 and 65, so I don't think the fact it's - now

about the prohibition.

QUESTION: Mr. -

6
