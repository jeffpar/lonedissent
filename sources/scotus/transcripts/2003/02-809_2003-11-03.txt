CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

next in No. 02-809, Maryland v. Joseph Jermaine Pringle.

5

Mr. Bair.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BAIR: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
When the officer stopped the car respondent was

10
11

riding in and found drugs packaged for distribution in the

12

rear seat armrest, and then also found a large amount of

13

cash in the glove compartment QUESTION: What - the rear seat armrest was

14
15

pushed up -

16

MR. BAIR: Yes, Your Honor.

17

QUESTION: - and then the drugs were behind the -

18

the armrest?
MR. BAIR: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

19

The rear seat

20

armrest was pushed up against the rear seat.

The officer

21

merely folded it down and then the drugs appeared, and

22

these are drugs that were packaged in five separate

23

individual packages that were packaged for distribution at

24

$20 a bag.

25

ball of cash in the glove compartment, and there - at that

The officer also found $763 in a rolled-up

Page 3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

time there was individualized probable cause that focused

2

on all three people in that car, and this is so for three

3

principal reasons.

First -

4

QUESTION: At the end of the day, what happened?

5

MR. BAIR: At the end of the day, all three were

6

arrested, respondent confessed, and said the QUESTION: And respondent was a front seat

7
8

passenger?
MR. BAIR: Yes, Justice O'Connor.

9
10

QUESTION: He's the one who confessed?

11

MR. BAIR: Yes.

12

QUESTION: And was found ultimately guilty of -

13

MR. BAIR: He was found -

14

QUESTION: - some drug-related offense?

15

MR. BAIR: He was found guilty both of possession

16

and possession with intent to distribute.

17

QUESTION: And the other two?

18

MR. BAIR: The other two were not charged

19

formally after respondent confessed.

The officer made a

20

discretionary decision not to charge the other two at the

21

station house after respondent confessed to this crime.
QUESTION: Do you say that there was probable

22
23

cause for the arrest of all three at the time they were

24

found?

25

MR. BAIR: Yes, Your Honor.

Page 4
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION: Was there probable cause sufficient to
support charges at a preliminary hearing -

3

MR. BAIR: I think there would have been.

4

QUESTION: - against all three?

5

MR. BAIR: I - yes, Justice O'Connor, I think

6

there would have been.

I think, given the circumstances

7

of this arrest, the mere fact that one of the three

8

confessed doesn't ultimately determine that the other two

9

were not culpable.
QUESTION: Is there any additional requirement

10
11

for establishing probable cause at a preliminary hearing

12

above and beyond what's needed for the arrest, or are they

13

identical, in your opinion?
MR. BAIR: I would say they're identical, Your

14
15

Honor.
QUESTION: So - so under - under that view,

16
17

assume no confession, hypothetical case, under that view,

18

these people, all of the three could have been bound over

19

for trial?

20

MR. BAIR: I believe so.

21

QUESTION: And under that view, any motion to

22
23
24
25

I believe so.

dismiss prior to trial would have to be denied?
MR. BAIR: I believe there would have been
probable cause to charge and to take the cases to trial.
QUESTION: And I suppose what happens in that

Page 5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

case is the judge says, and I want to tell you right up

2

front I think this is a very skimpy case, you'd better

3

come up with something - I guess that's the way it works -

4
5

MR. BAIR: I think so -

6

QUESTION: But there's - but the - as Justice

7

O'Connor said, it's probable cause and it's the same

8

standard - excuse me - it's the same standard to bind over

9

on arraignment as it is for the officer to arrest?

10

MR. BAIR: My understanding from the case law,

11

Your Honor, is that probable cause is probable cause, be

12

it to search, to arrest, or it - I think it's a fluid

13

concept, obviously depending on the exact context, and I'm

14

not saying that a prosecutor would not exercise discretion

15

as would a police officer in a given case not to take a

16

case forward.

17
18

QUESTION: Well, a preliminary hearing is largely
a matter of Maryland law, isn't it, or State law?

19

MR. BAIR: It is and -

20

QUESTION: I mean, is there any - any

21

constitutional requirement that there be a preliminary

22

hearing before a criminal case is tried?

23

MR. BAIR: Not that I know of, Your Honor, no.

24

QUESTION: Well, I take it even under the

25

Constitution, if it's a Federal case, both the indictment

Page 6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

and the - or the information shows simply probable cause,

2

that's enough to bind over?

3
4
5

MR. BAIR: I believe so, Justice Kennedy, I
believe so.

Now, in this case, of course, there was -

QUESTION: But if you say it's fluid, that - that

6

concerns me.

7

Government said in its brief, page 26 to 28, it says,

8

well, you know, it's fluid, the prosecutor takes a second

9

look and it - it sounds as if the prosecutor has a greater

10
11

I was somewhat puzzled by what the

burden, but I - I'm not sure that that's the law.
MR. BAIR: I'm not sure it's a greater burden.

12

think the prosecutor's decision, of course, is looking

13

forward to trial where they know that they have to prove

14

the case beyond a reasonable doubt.

15

to get past a motion for judgment of acquittal.

16

police officer on the scene is making the same type of

17

decision vis-a-vis probable cause but it's in a very

18

different context.

19

I

They know they have
The

I think that's the difference.

QUESTION: In your view, is this very fact-

20

specific so that it might come out differently if the

21

money and the drugs had been located in some little pocket

22

next to the driver as opposed to some rear seat passenger

23

or other passenger?

24
25

MR. BAIR: I think one factor that would
significantly change the totality of the circumstances

Page 7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

here would be, for instance, if the drugs had been found

2

on the person of one of the passengers.
QUESTION: No, that wasn't my question.

3
4

What if

-

5

MR. BAIR: If it had been -

6

QUESTION: - they were found very close to the

7

driver, you know, sometimes there's a little pocket right

8

next to -

9
10

MR. BAIR: In the door?
QUESTION: - on the door, on the driver's side.

11

Suppose it were there but you had a passenger in the front

12

and in the rear.

13

Any different result?

MR. BAIR: Not in this case, no.

I think - I

14

think if - if the drugs are found in a common area of the

15

passenger compartment of the car -

16

QUESTION: How about the trunk?

17

MR. BAIR: I think the trunk changes things a

18

little bit, but of course you have to look at the totality

19

of the circumstances, Justice Ginsburg.

20

QUESTION: Why a little bit?

I thought this

21

whole case was predicated - your whole case was predicated

22

on those drugs between the armrest and the backseat were

23

accessible to all three people in that car.

24

MR. BAIR: That's -

25

QUESTION: Now, if you have something in a locked

Page 8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

trunk, it truly is not accessible to the passengers.
MR. BAIR: It certainly is not as accessible, and

3

of course it's not as immediately accessible, but, for

4

instance, if there had been a large quantity of drugs in

5

the trunk or if there had been a dead body in the trunk, I

6

think then there is a - the calculus changes in terms of

7

totality of the circumstances, and I think if it were that

8

situation, even though that particular evidence was in the

9

trunk, I think there's still a - a strong inference that

10

could be drawn that everyone in the car knew about it,

11

because who would take the chance in terms of taking along

12

innocent passengers -

13

QUESTION: Well, let's stick to the five - these

14

five bags that were stuck in a Ziploc bag.

15

is in the trunk, not a dead body.

16

MR. BAIR: I understand.

The Ziploc bag

I think in that case

17

there would be a much closer case, it would be a much more

18

difficult case vis-a-vis all three occupants of the car.

19

QUESTION: But under -

20

QUESTION: Okay, what about the -

21

QUESTION: - under - under your view, if - if the

22

car is in a high crime area and some mother gets a ride

23

from her son who she perhaps doesn't know has been

24

involved in drugs, then if drugs are found anywhere in

25

that car, she's subject to arrest and - and sufficient for

Page 9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

charge?

2

MR. BAIR: Not - not -

3

QUESTION: I mean, suppose it's at - in the

4

middle of the day and she's going to the grocery store, we

5

don't have it at 3:00 a.m. in an area where drugs are

6

frequently sold.

Does that enter into the calculus?

7

MR. BAIR: I think it does, Your Honor.

I think,

8

obviously with - with - with the totality of the

9

circumstances, anytime you change - and, of course, some

10

of these are going to have more minor impact, some are

11

going to have more major impact.

12

had, of course, 3:16 in the morning, three men who were

13

roughly of the same age who appeared to be intimately

14

connected with one another, you had the drugs and the

15

money.

16

Justice O'Connor -

I think here's a very strong case, but I agree,

QUESTION: What if there had been four people in

17
18
19
20

But in this case you

the car?
MR. BAIR: I don't know that four people would
change things.

21

QUESTION: How about six?

22

MR. BAIR: I think within the -

23

QUESTION: Or what if it was a minivan and there

24
25

were eight in the minivan?
(Laughter.)

Page 10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BAIR: I'm not sure it changes it

2

significantly, Your Honor.

3

significant -

I think that the most

QUESTION: You think with eight people in the

4
5

minivan you could arrest all eight and hold them over for

6

trial?
MR. BAIR: I think if you have identical

7
8

circumstances to these in terms of the time, how well-

9

acquainted they all appeared, the fact there was money,

10

the fact that there were drugs packaged for distribution.

11

It appeared to the officer, a reasonable inference, that

12

there was a drug distribution common enterprise.
QUESTION: But the distribution, as I understand

13
14

it, was just enough to take care of a big party.

There

15

was no evidence that they were for sale, was there?
MR. BAIR: Well, the evidence, at the time the

16
17

officer made the arrest, I think he could draw an

18

inference that there was cash proceeds perhaps of former

19

drug sales, prior drug sales, and there were five

20

individually packaged crack - hits of crack cocaine.
QUESTION: And the charge was possession with

21
22

intent to distribute, wasn't it?
MR. BAIR: Yes, it was both simple possession and

23
24

possession with intent to distribute, and he was

25

convicted.

Page 11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: How about if it had been a bus?

Now,

2

we've gone from the sedan to the minivan, how about the

3

bus?
MR. BAIR: I think a bus is different, Your

4
5

Honor.

6

- in the context of, of course, the numbers of people are

7

much greater, and then there's QUESTION: Are you talking about a public bus or

8
9

I think a bus changes things significantly in the

you're talking about a chartered bus?

10

(Laughter.)

11

MR. BAIR: I think that would affect obviously

12

the totality of circumstances as well.
QUESTION: What - what is - what is the rule that

13
14

you're - there's the restatement hypotheticals -

15

Restatement of Torts, where there's the dead body, two

16

people are each accusing the other, and add - I don't know

17

how the hypothetical would work - but add to the mix that

18

only one could have done it.

Can you arrest both?

MR. BAIR: I think you can, Your Honor.

19

I think

20

both the Restatement of Torts, the Model Code of Pre-

21

Arraignment Procedure, and just the - the nature of

22

probable cause would permit that, because we're talking

23

about -

24
25

QUESTION: The Model Code of Pre-Arraignment
Procedure just talks again about probable cause?

Page 12
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BAIR: Same situation where you have, say,

2

two people, only one of whom could be guilty of the crime.

3

You could still have - you still would have probable cause

4

to arrest both.
QUESTION: But that's two people and here you've

5
6

got three.
QUESTION: What about three?

7
8

I was going to ask,

what about three?
MR. BAIR: I think three is - is -

9
10

QUESTION: You can arrest all three?

11

MR. BAIR: I think so.

12

QUESTION: What about five?

13

arrest all five?

14

and worse -

You're going to

Even - I mean, you know, it gets worse

15

MR. BAIR: Well, of course.

16

QUESTION: - 10 percent chance, there are 10 of

17

them now -

18

MR. BAIR: And - and -

19

QUESTION: - so the chance that any individual

20
21

one did it is 10 percent.

That's still enough?

MR. BAIR: I think we can't draw - the Court in

22

Gates said that you cannot quantify probable cause.

23

have to - in those circumstances -

24

QUESTION: It doesn't mean probable.

25

MR. BAIR: No, it does not mean probable.

Page 13
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

You

1

Clearly -

2

QUESTION: Why do we call it probable cause?

3

MR. BAIR: I'm not - I think there's a bit of a

4

misnomer there, but clearly from the case law of this

5

Court, it means a fair probability, it means something

6

greater than reasonable suspicion under Terry QUESTION: But if you had to reduce it to a

7
8

percentage figure, what would you call the percentage

9

required for probable cause?
MR. BAIR: I don't know that I could, Your Honor.

10
11

I really don't know that it's useful to QUESTION: But it's less than 50, though, I

12
13

gather?
MR. BAIR: Yes.

14
15

Your - the cases of this Court

has said QUESTION: So that takes care of the two people

16
17

in the room, but when you get down to 33-1/3 with three

18

people?
MR. BAIR: I think - I think three people clearly

19
20

would be QUESTION: And with four people it would be 25

21
22

percent.

Is that enough?

23

MR. BAIR: Probably, probably.

24

QUESTION: Probably.

25

(Laughter.)

Page 14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: You - you agree - you agree that at

2

some point the probability is - when the numbers of people

3

present keep increasing, at some point the probability is

4

going to be too slim?
MR. BAIR: Yes, I agree with that.

5

I agree with

6

that, but again, in Illinois v. Gates, this Court said we

7

will not, we cannot, it's not useful to try to quantify

8

probable cause in that way, we still have to look at the

9

totality of the circumstances beyond whether there are two

10

people or three people or whatever.

11

QUESTION: And one is -

12

MR. BAIR: Of course, on the Government's theory

13

I don't think it would matter, because they say you can

14

infer a conspiracy, and I suppose then the whole bus could

15

be in the conspiracy, but if it's an individual approach,

16

which I think you're taking, then the number of people

17

might make a difference.
MR. BAIR: I think so.

18

Now, of course, it would

19

depend on - on the crime that the probable cause was going

20

to.

21

jointly and constructively possessed, so clearly in this

22

particular car, all three of the people could be guilty of

23

the crime, not just one.

24
25

In this particular crime, of course, drugs can be

QUESTION: Do you accept Justice Stevens'
suggestion that your position might differ from the

Page 15
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2
3
4

Government here?
MR. BAIR: I don't know that it does.

I think

our positions are basically the same.
QUESTION: So - so you do think a conspiracy can

5

generally - can be inferred as to all people in these - in

6

the instance like this?

7
8
9
10
11
12
13

MR. BAIR: In our case, absolutely, absolutely.
In our case, clearly QUESTION: But if one of them QUESTION: But you didn't argue the - excuse me you didn't argue the conspiracy theory in the State
court, I don't think, did you?
MR. BAIR: Well, I think we did, Your Honor.

I

14

think we argued in the State court that because drugs can

15

be jointly and constructively possessed, that any one,

16

two, or three of the individuals in the car were - were

17

guilty of this crime.

18

QUESTION: If you know nothing more than what you

19

know here - I mean, I take it that if - if it were

20

undisputed that one of the three was a hitchhiker, you -

21

you would not make the argument with respect to the

22

hitchhiker?

23

MR. BAIR: I think if - if it's undisputed, and

24

of course, that's going to be a difficult situation to -

25

to know that there's no actual connection -

Page 16
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

QUESTION: That's the wonderful thing about being
on the Supreme Court.

3

MR. BAIR: If it's -

4

QUESTION: You can make those assumptions.

5

MR. BAIR: If it's undisputed, then I think that

6

significantly changes, because I think a lot - a core

7

concept here is this notion of common enterprise, that

8

when you have people in a car together, particularly a

9

small passenger car, there's an inference, I think in this

10

case a very strong inference, that all three of these

11

people were engaged in a common enterprise.

So -

12

QUESTION: But do you have - do you need the -

13

QUESTION: What if the car - what if the car

14

included a driver and two hitchhikers and the drugs were

15

found exactly as they were here, and there's obviously no

16

common enterprise, would there be probable cause?

17

MR. BAIR: I guess it would be - of course, that

18

would be a more difficult case because you had the money

19

in the glove compartment of the car and the drugs in the

20

backseat of the car, so that -

21

QUESTION: I'm not sure the money really adds

22

anything to the analysis, to tell you the truth.

23

MR. BAIR: I think it adds -

24

QUESTION: Because there's certainly nothing

25

illegal about carrying money in the glove compartment,

Page 17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

where it is illegal to carry drugs in the - behind the

2

seat - the armrest.
MR. BAIR: Well, certainly the money without the

3
4

drugs would be a - a different case than the drugs without

5

the money.

6

QUESTION: But you -

7

QUESTION: The hitchhiker - the hitchhiker

8

example poses a question for the arresting officer,

9

because does he have to accept the declaration of someone

10
11

that I'm just a hitchhiker here?
MR. BAIR: No, and - and that, of course, goes

12

back to whether it's undisputed in some way, I don't know

13

quite how it would be undisputed.

14

You've always got the -

the officer who on the scene is making a reasonable

15

judgement from all the facts and circumstances, and one of

16

those is, I don't have to believe the criminal or

17

criminals in this car.

18

we have a known crime here being committed in the presence

19

of the officer, possession or possession with intent to

20

distribute drugs.

21

I know there are drugs in the car,

QUESTION: Well, I'm still curious about the

22

answer to my question.

Assume the officer did accept the

23

truth of the representation they were two - two

24

hitchhikers picked up at different times, and maybe he was

25

following the car, for instance, so he knew that was true,

and then there's the driver and then there are drugs in

2

the backseat just as there are here.

3

probable cause in that case?

Would there be

MR. BAIR: Two - two answers to that, Justice

4
5

Stevens.

One, of course, is you would measure the

6

probable cause by an objective standard and not by the

7

subjective standard of that particular police officer.

8

The other is QUESTION: But what is the answer?

9
10

MR. BAIR: The other is, it could be that -

11

QUESTION: I thought you were going to say the

12

two answers were yes and no.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. BAIR: It could be, Your Honor, that the -

15

the driver knew the hitchhikers and that's why he picked

16

them up.

I mean, a lot of times people QUESTION: No, no, no.

17

I'm just assuming the

18

only relevant facts are that it's undisputed they were two

19

- two unrelated - they're three unrelated people, they're

20

just entirely different backgrounds, one doesn't even

21

speak English and one doesn't speak Spanish, but there are

22

three of them in the car and the drugs are found exactly

23

under the circumstances here.

24

there were no conspiracy theory, would there be probable

25

cause?

What I'm trying to say - if

MR. BAIR: I think so, yes.

Yes, I think there

would be.

QUESTION: You - you have - you really have to

4

say that based on the dead victim hypothetical that you

5

answered earlier.

6

MR. BAIR: I think so, I think so, that - that if

7

the, again, one - the other inference among the - the -

8

the indicators of a common enterprise would be, I think

it's unusual that several people are going to be taking a

chance driving around, either with evidence of a murder or

evidence of a drug conspiracy.

take the chance of having innocent people along.

They're not simply as a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SRI SRINIVASAN

19

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

20

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

21
22

MR. SRINIVASAN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,
and may it please the Court:

23

The totality of the circumstances apparent to

24

the officer at the scene established probable cause for

25

respondent's arrest.

Of particular significance, the

Page 20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

officer uncovered drugs that were packaged for

2

distribution and that were concealed in the location in

3

which they were readily discoverable by the other

4

passengers.
QUESTION: Your brief reads to me - at about page

5
6

15 - to suggest that you're proposing a broad rule that

7

probable cause exists to arrest all occupants of a car

8

anytime commercial quantities of narcotics are found in

9

the passenger portion of the car.

10

MR. SRINIVASAN: It's - we don't intend -

11

QUESTION: Is that your position?

12

MR. SRINIVASAN: We don't intend to suggest a

13

broad rule, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION: Do you agree that it is a totality of

14
15

the circumstances test?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, it's a totality of the

16
17

circumstances test, and it will turn on contextual factors

18

that are present in any particular case.
QUESTION: Well, you do say at page 15, beginning

19
20

of the first full paragraph, for these reasons, the

21

discovery of an amount of narcotics suitable for

22

distribution in the passenger compartment supports an

23

inference that all of the car's occupants were aware of,

24

and hence, involved with the drugs.

25

statement.

That's a sweeping

Page 21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, what - what we intend to

2

say is that ordinarily when drugs that are packaged for

3

distribution are found in a location in which they're

4

readily discoverable by the other passengers, a reasonable

5

officer can fairly conclude that there's a fair

6

probability that each passenger is - is aware of the

7

drugs, but of course in particular cases -

8
9

QUESTION: But it - it might - wouldn't different
factors enter into it?

Suppose it's a young child -

10

MR. SRINIVASAN: Absolutely, Justice O'Connor.

11

QUESTION: - in the vehicle, and it's in the

12

middle of the day and they're dropping the child off at

13

school or something.

14

nonetheless be this inference and the child could be

15

hauled up and sent to the juvenile court?

16

Are you suggesting there would

MR. SRINIVASAN: No.

The inference is tethered

17

to the particular facts of this case.

In cases that

18

present different facts, for example, if a child was in

19

the car of - if, as was earlier discussed, a hitchhiker

20

were in the car, the probable - probable cause calculus

21

would be different.

22

to suspect that any of the individuals was uninvolved in

23

the possession of the cocaine.

24

particularly significant in this case in our view is the

25

location in which the drugs were found, because they were

But in this case there was no reason

In fact, what's

Page 22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

found wedged behind the rear seat armrest, which

2

apparently is the type of armrest that's adjustable in an

3

up or down position.

4

armrest is to give the passenger an option according to

5

his preference whether the position - the armrest in one

6

position or the other, so it's highly -

The very purpose of that type of

QUESTION: The only evidence that supports the

7
8

notion that some were uninvolved is that as soon as one of

9

them confessed, the police immediately dismissed the

10

charge against the other two, and therefore abandoned the

11

notion that it was a common enterprise.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, I - it - there's a - I

12
13

think there's a different question concerning whether

14

there was probable cause for an arrest and the

15

determination by an officer whether to proceed with

16

charges.

Just because the officer QUESTION: You'd think if the - if the backseat

17
18

person or whoever it was that confessed had confessed

19

while the officer was arresting him, there would have

20

remained the probable cause as to the other two?

21

have said, I don't believe you, I'll take all three of you

22

in anyway?

Could he

23

MR. SRINIVASAN: There might well have been,

24

Justice Stevens, because an officer's not required to

25

believe the version of events that's given to him by

Page 23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

people on the scene.

2

have a coordinated plan in advance to pin the blame on a

3

particular person as opposed to the other two, and an

4

officer can take into account the totality of

5

circumstances in making that type of assessment.

6

It might well be the case that they

QUESTION: May I - may I clarify whether you are

7

indeed relying on common enterprise?

I thought the view

8

was it may or may not be a common enterprise, but here is

9

a situation, drugs equally accessible, drugs accessible to

10

any one of the three.

We can't say whether all three or

11

which one, so looking at the three, and we say, well, it's

12

not more - not more likely the driver than the front seat

13

passenger, who's there behind the money, or the backseat

14

passenger, because any one of them could have pulled down

15

that armrest.

16

necessarily a common enterprise.

I thought that was your theory, not a - not

MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Justice

17
18

Ginsburg.

It's not necessarily a common enterprise.

It

19

could be any one of the three or it could be all of them

20

or some combination of the three of them, and the

21

combination of those various scenarios rose to the level

22

of a fair probability that respondent was involved with

23

the cocaine.

24

particularly the case because they were concealed behind

25

the armrest, which is a type of instrument that

And as I was - as I was saying, that's

Page 24
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

affirmatively invites manipulation by a passenger, so if

2

one of the occupants of the vehicle alone were responsible

3

for carrying cocaine, it seems quite unlikely that he

4

would have chosen the area behind the armrest as a place

5

to conceal it from the other passengers.
QUESTION: Do - do we demand the same standard

6
7

from the arresting officer as we do from the district

8

attorney who decides whether or not to proceed to

9

preliminary hearing?
MR. SRINIVASAN: The probable cause standard

10
11

works the same.

12

whether there's a fair probability.

Now -

QUESTION: But - but do we demand a higher

13
14

In both situations the question would be

standard -

15

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, it's -

16

QUESTION: - from either of them in making that

17
18

assessment?
MR. SRINIVASAN: It's often the case that

19

prosecutors will have more rigorous standards as a matter

20

of internal - matter of internal guidelines.

21

example, in the U.S. Attorney's manual, it dictates that

22

prosecutors in the Federal system need to ensure that it's

23

likely that they'll be able to obtain a conviction on -

24
25

And for

QUESTION: Well isn't - isn't that - that means
the - the probable cause standard is the same, but the

Page 25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

prosecutor has an obligation to try to find out more and

2

get more evidence before he goes forward.

3

difference?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Right.

4

Isn't that the

The nature of the

5

application of the probable cause standard is different in

6

the prosecutorial stage because the prosecutor is

7

identifying a particular offense, laying out the facts to

8

support that offense, and the QUESTION: But the - but the standard - the

9
10

standard that determines the - the - the degree of

11

likelihood of inference, that is the same standard,

12

whether we're talking about the police officer or whether

13

we're talking about the district attorney later?
MR. SRINIVASAN: Correct. That remains constant

14
15

in both scenarios.
QUESTION: I - I'm not sure what you're saying.

16
17

You're saying it - it can get to the jury with no more

18

than probable cause and should not be thrown out by the

19

court?

20

MR. SRINIVASAN: There's a different - there's a

21

different question whether the evidence is sufficient to

22

convict as presented by the prosecutor and whether the

23

prosecutor has enough to go forward with the charges.

24
25

QUESTION: No, but you're saying the prosecutor
does not have an obligation to refrain from bringing a

Page 26
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

prosecution where he plainly on the face of it doesn't

2

have enough evidence to convict?
MR. SRINIVASAN: As long as there's probable

3
4

cause to go forward, the prosecutor can go forward with

5

the charges.
QUESTION: To say plainly on the face of it is

6
7

something that a - a prosecutor is seldom confronted with.

8

I mean, you've got different people telling different

9

stories usually and it's usually a question of who's

10

believed.
MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Mr. Chief

11
12

Justice, and QUESTION: Well, I'm assuming he has three people

13
14

in the car and the chance for each of them is 33-1/3

15

percent -

16

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, he could go -

17

QUESTION: - and he prosecutes one of them and he

18

has nothing else.

That's all he has, three people in the

19

car, stuff in the back seat -

20

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's -

21

QUESTION: - and he picks the passenger and

22

brings a prosecution.

23

me, it could have been the other two, 33-1/3 percent.

24
25

The passenger, it could have been

MR. SRINIVASAN: Well, that's - that's different
from the facts of this case, but even assuming that it

Page 27
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

were an equal likelihood that each of them independently

2

were involved in the offense, the prosecutor could go

3

forward in that situation, but it's highly unlikely that

4

he would go forward in that situation because - because

5

he's unlikely to obtain to a verdict in his favor.

6

there's institutional incentives -

So

7

QUESTION: And the district court probably would

8

not let the case go to the jury if the motion was made at

9

the end of the prosecution's case and this was all you

10

had?

11

MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct, Justice Kennedy.

12

QUESTION: The prosecution should - the

13

prosecutor should bring cases which clearly will not be

14

able to go to the jury?

15

MR. SRINIVASAN: No, not should bring cases -

16

QUESTION: May, may.

17

MR. SRINIVASAN: May, under the Constitution.

18

QUESTION: Okay, that's not my understanding of

19
20

the prosecutor's MR. SRINIVASAN: And that's why, I think,

21

prosecutors typically enforce upon themselves a more

22

rigorous obligation than the probable cause standard.

23
24
25

QUESTION: But we have no case saying that they
may not proceed?
MR. SRINIVASAN: No, there's no case that I'm

Page 28
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

aware of that says that they can't proceed where there's

2

probable cause.

3
4

QUESTION: But you just said the manual
instructed them not to bring cases to trial.

5

MR. SRINIVASAN: In - in the Federal system -

6

QUESTION: Yes.

7

MR. SRINIVASAN: - there's Federal guidelines

8

that spell out when Federal prosecutors are supposed to

9

bring cases to trial, but I'm not aware that that's

10

required by Federal law or by the Constitution.

11

prosecutor's office might have their own QUESTION: Do you have readily at hand the - the

12
13

citation to the manual?
MR. SRINIVASAN: I don't - I don't have the

14
15

particular provision.
QUESTION: Of course, the - the manual wouldn't

16
17

Each

in any way bind Maryland authority.

18

MR. SRINIVASAN: That's correct.

19

prosecutor's office might have different standards.
QUESTION: If - if the Federal manual binds

20
21
22

Each

anyone.
MR. SRINIVASAN: Right.

Well, the deficiencies

23

in the Maryland court's probable cause analysis, we think,

24

are particularly are apparent when one considers the

25

implications for officers at the scene in circumstances

Page 29
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

like this case, because apparently the up-shot is that

2

officers either could arrest no one or that they could

3

arrest the driver alone, and the latter situation seems

4

unsound because perhaps the least likely scenario in

5

circumstances like this case is that - that the driver was

6

acting alone and carrying the contraband in the car,

7

because if the driver in fact were acting alone, one might

8

expect that he would conceal the contraband in a location

9

in which it was not so readily discoverable by the other

10

passengers.
QUESTION: What about the respondent's position

11
12

that your position means two innocent people may be locked

13

up in jail, because suppose Pringle hadn't fessed up, and

14

he exercised his right to remain silent.

15

have a prolonged periods, assuming they couldn't make

16

bail, three people stuck in the brig and two of them are

17

innocent.

18

Then you might

MR. SRINIVASAN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, it's

19

possible that innocent persons will be arrested and bound

20

over in circumstances like in this case, but the probable

21

cause standard accepts that possibility as the cost of

22

ensuring the effective enforcement of the criminal laws.

23

In fact, this Court reiterated in Wardlow recently that

24

the probable cause standard accepts that innocent persons

25

may be arrested on occasion.

That's simply the cost of a

Page 30
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

functioning criminal justice system.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MS. FORSTER: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
This is a unique case with highly unusual facts,

9

and the reason it is unique is because of the facts - not

10

because of the facts that exist so much in this case, but

11

because of those that do not exist here.

12

testimony whatsoever in this case that Mr. Pringle had

13

control over or knowledge of the drugs hidden in the back

seat of the car -

15

There was no

QUESTION: Ms. Forster, when you say testimony,

16

you're not referring to any scheduled hearing or formal

17

hearing, are you?

18

MS. FORSTER: Well, Your Honor, what the court in

19

Maryland reviews on appeal is the motion to suppress

20

hearing, and at that hearing there was no evidence

21

presented whatsoever that the officer in this case noticed

22

any furtive movements by Mr. Pringle, any furtive

23

gestures, that he said anything suspicious at the scene,

24

or that he acted in any unusually nervous manner.

QUESTION: Well, I thought we were considering

2

this on the basis offered, which is the three people at

3

3:30 a.m. in a high crime neighborhood in a sedan where

4

there were a certain quantity of drugs behind the armrest

5

and money in the glove compartment.
MS. FORSTER: A few corrections, if I may,

6
7

Justice O'Connor -

8

QUESTION: Three people in the car.

9

MS. FORSTER: This is - 3:00 a.m. is accurate,

10

3:16 a.m.

11

fact a high crime area.

12

totality of circumstances we have to put that in context,

13

and the context is this, that it's 3:00 a.m. on a Saturday

14

night with a car of three young men in their twenties in a

15

residential area, and I think that anyone who has children

16

of that age knows that often their Saturday night does not

17

even begin until 10:00 or 11:00 p.m.

18
19

It is in a residential area.

This was not in

And I think that under the

QUESTION: Well, a lot of people wouldn't refer
to children as being in their twenties, I think.

20

(Laughter.)

21

MS. FORSTER: Young adult children, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION: You - you make an interesting opening

23

statement that this is a highly unusual - we've - a lot of

24

us read a lot of these cases.

25

all the time, that drugs in the car, the person says, it's

It seems to me this happens

Page 32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

not mine.

It seems to me that that's commonplace.
MS. FORSTER: But what we have here with respect

2
3

to Mr. Pringle is simply presence and nothing more.

4

have no further -

We

QUESTION: But isn't there - isn't there

5
6

something more than presence here?

Isn't the significance

7

- isn't the significant evidence of this case something

8

that appears when you contrast it with Houghton from a

9

couple of years ago?

Houghton, you had evidence that the

10

driver of the car was a recreational, a personal drug

11

user.

12

certainly today, assume that everyone who is in the

13

company of a recreational drug user is also a drug user or

14

an accessory to the first person's drug use.

15

however, what the police officer had was evidence, not

16

merely of the time, but of - of three people in a

17

relatively small car with commercial quantities of drugs,

18

an amount of money that was enough to suggest that drug

19

dealing was going on, and I think a - an inference was

20

possible that someone in that car was dealing in the

21

drugs.

22

We don't, I think, in this society, at least

Here,

And it seems to me that the different inference

23

that can be drawn about the others here as distinct from

24

the inference in the Houghton case is, most drug dealers

25

do not go around in their place of business, the car, with

Page 33
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

people who are totally innocent of drug activity -

2

MS. FORSTER: If I -

3

QUESTION: - and isn't that the basic difference

4

between this and Houghton and doesn't that inference

5

support - amount to probably cause?
MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, if I - if I may, with

6
7

respect to this being packaging - the drugs packaged that

8

is indicative of sale or for distribution, there was

9

absolutely no evidence in this record that this was

10

anything inconsistent with personal use.

11

QUESTION: Five - five crack cocaine hits?

12

MS. FORSTER: Yes, Your Honor.

In fact, I think

13

that there are a lot of crack cocaine addicts for which

14

that is a small amount of personal use.

15

QUESTION: But is -

16

QUESTION: How about a big roll of money?

17

MS. FORSTER: And, Your Honor, also, there's a

18

problem with the record in this respect with regard to

19

money -

20

QUESTION: Well, you pointed it out, but I think

21

it - I thought, and tell me if I'm wrong here, I thought

22

that it was - it was - the evidence was, regardless of how

23

he first described the quantity that he saw, I thought the

24

evidence came out that there was 700 and some odd dollars

25

in it, so I think the judge could infer that it was fairly

Page 34
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

- a fairly sizable roll of bills.
MS. FORSTER: Justice Souter, the actual amount

3

did not come out until the trial.

4

the motion to suppress hearing, and in fact, the amount of

5

money was never characterized at the motion to suppress

6

hearing by the officer who testified, other than to say he

7

saw the sum of money, that's all.

8
9
10
11
12
13

That never came out at

QUESTION: And what is in - and it was in the
glove compartment?
MS. FORSTER: It was concealed in the glove
compartment?
QUESTION: And it was open, it wasn't in a wallet
or something like that?

14

QUESTION: A roll of bills.

15

MS. FORSTER: We don't - we don't know.

16

the officer who - Officer Snyder, when he testified at the

17

motion to suppress hearing, simply said that when Mr.

18

Parlo, the driver of the automobile, went to retrieve his

19

license and registration from the glove box, that is when

20

I saw the money.

In fact,

21

QUESTION: So it's reasonable -

22

QUESTION: But he - he must have seen it in the

23

form of a - a roll of bills or something, rather than, as

24

Justice Souter said, just not in a wallet.

25

MS. FORSTER: The record is unclear.

2

QUESTION: Well, but, I mean, you - you don't
have to have been born yesterday to decide that.
MS. FORSTER: Well, the - Your Honor, I guess the

3
4

point is, is that all that was before the trial - the

5

trial judge at the motion to suppress hearing - there was

6

never any characterization of the denomination, the

7

amount, nothing, just the only thing that was said was the

8

money.

9
10

QUESTION: Do you have a roll of bills exposed in
your glove compartment?

11

MS. FORSTER: At times I do, Your Honor.

12

QUESTION: You do?

13

MS. FORSTER: Yes.

14

QUESTION: You better be careful if you do.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MS. FORSTER: I might also point out that at the

17

actual trial, the expert who did testify for the State

18

with regard to the - whether or not this was an intent to

19

distribute - testified that without Mr. Pringle's

20

confession and this statement, he could not in fact say

21

that this was consistent with an intent to distribute

22

based solely -

23

QUESTION: So it was at least possession.

So

24

would you concede that a crime - in the officer's presence

25

there was evidence of the commission of a crime?

Page 36
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. FORSTER: Yes.

2

QUESTION: Then - so the officer says, I know

3

that a crime has been committed.

4

are only three possible people who could do it.

5

instruction would you give to the officer on the scene who

6

knows that a crime has been committed, there are three

7

possible people, but he can't say which?

8

that he can make no arrest?

9

In the whole world there
What

Is it the answer

MS. FORSTER: No, that's not the answer.

10

QUESTION: What arrest can he make?

11

MS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, in this case, the

12

officer could arrest Mr. Parlo, the driver of the

13

automobile, because I think it is universally accepted

14

that we can impute the driver owner of an automobile with

15

the knowledge that he knows what is in his car and he has

16

exclusive control over that which is in his car.

17

officer here should have arrested Mr. Parlo.

So the

18

QUESTION: And no one else?

19

MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, I would suggest that

20

perhaps - I mean, and of course, this is not the issue

21

before the Court, that perhaps because of Mr. Smith, the

22

backseat occupant, may also have been arrested given that

23

the nature of an armrest is not really a normal repository

24

that one would place personal items in -

25

QUESTION: So maybe - definitely the driver,

Page 37
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

maybe the backseat passenger -

2

MS. FORSTER: Maybe Mr. Smith.

3

QUESTION: - but not the one who in fact -

4

MS. FORSTER: But definitely -

5

QUESTION: - who in fact committed the crime.

6

MS. FORSTER: Definitely not Mr. Pringle, but of

7

course, if we're going to use Mr. Pringle's confession in

8

determining in hindsight, we need not have QUESTION: If this were - if this were a bus or a

9
10

tavern or a theater or some of the examples, then it

11

certainly would unreasonable to assume that the front seat

12

passenger could reach back to the last row of the theater.

13

But here, this was a small car.

14

somebody in the front seat to turn around and push down

15

the armrest.

It isn't hard for

MS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, I agree with that

16
17

- that perhaps it would not be difficult, given the

18

compact nature of this car.

19

testimony that in fact that anyone saw Mr. Pringle do

20

that, number one, and number two -

However, there was no

QUESTION: Well, that's because they - they

21
22

didn't have a buy committed in the presence of the officer

23

at the scene.
MS. FORSTER: Well, I - I understand that, Your

24
25

Honor.

Page 38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2
3

QUESTION: I mean, I don't know why that counts
against MS. FORSTER: Well, my second response would be

4

this, that I think that it would be highly unreasonable

5

that Mr. Smith, the backseat passenger, would allow Mr.

6

Pringle to turn around and store the drugs in the armrest

7

right next to him.

8

QUESTION: Why?

9

QUESTION: Ms. Forster, the Maryland Court of

10

Appeals, which ruled in your favor, says, during the

11

search Officer Snyder seized $763 from the glove

12

compartment, so they are - they accepted that as a fact.

13

MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, the Maryland - with all

14

due respect, the Maryland Court of Appeals made a mistake

15

in this case because what they said in their opinion -

16

QUESTION: Well, but no, we take the facts as the

17

lower court found them.

18

to say that the court of appeals is wrong on the facts.

19

I mean, I don't think it will do

MS. FORSTER: Your Honor, what the court of

20

appeals incorrectly did in this case was - and they

21

dropped a footnote to suggest that it was unclear to them

22

whether or not there was a separate motion to suppress

23

hearing or whether there was a combined motion to suppress

24

trial proceeding.

25

separate motion to suppress hearing.

In fact, that's incorrect.

Page 39
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

There was a

1
2

QUESTION: But the - but they nonetheless say
that Office Snyder seized $763.
MS. FORSTER: That's true, Your Honor, and for

3
4

purposes of Mr. Pringle's position, the fact that that

5

money is concealed, really it makes no difference the

6

amount.

7

Solicitor find the amount to be significant, I think we

8

should have a clearer record.

9

However, if the - as the petitioner and the U.S.

QUESTION: Why - why did you say the driver, I

10

mean, on your theory?

11

driver who's driving along to put the bags back in the

12

backseat than it would be for the passengers.

13

I think it would be harder for the

MS. FORSTER: Well, Justice Breyer, that assumes

14

that the driver did not put it there before he picked up

15

his passengers.

16
17
18

QUESTION: Well, if he put it there before,
wouldn't they all know it was there?
MS. FORSTER: I don't think so, Your Honor.

19

it's - if it's sandwiched between the armrest as it's

20

pushed up against the seat, no, I don't.

21

If

QUESTION: But the driver consented to have the

22

car searched, so one might think, my goodness, if he knew

23

there were drugs there, why did he say yes when he could

24

have said no?

25

MS. FORSTER: Justice Ginsburg, I can tell you as

Page 40
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

a criminal defense lawyer that defendants consent all the

2

time when they have a car full of drugs and they know the

3

drugs are there.

It's not unusual and it -

QUESTION: This is not like the - one of the

4
5

cases that you relied on is the Di Re case.

6

to me was, arrest the driver.

7

fingered the driver, so the police knew that they had the

8

right man when they arrested the driver.

9

at all like Di Re because the driver may or may not have

10

Your answer

There, the informer had

Here, it isn't

been the right person.
MS. FORSTER: Except that - how this case is

11
12

similar to Di Re is that in Di Re this Court held that if

13

the act - the criminal activity, the ongoing criminal

14

activity, is not visible to the occupants, the mere

15

presence is not enough on which to have probable cause to

16

arrest.

17

than Mr. Pringle's presence in the front seat.

And here we have concealed drugs and nothing more

QUESTION: But there - there's - there's another

18
19

difference.

The drugs are not locked up in the trunk.

20

They are at a place where the backseat person could push

21

it down.

22

drugs securely.

There wasn't a serious attempt to hide those

MS. FORSTER: Yes, Justice Ginsburg, I agree with

23
24

that.

But however, that would only point more closely to

25

Mr. Smith, the backseat person sitting directly next to

Page 41
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

the armrest, not to Mr. Pringle, the front seat passenger.
QUESTION: Well, except if - if you accept the

2
3

proposition that the - that there probably was a roll of

4

bills visible in the glove compartment, Mr. Pringle was

5

within easy reach, not even arm's reach of the rolled

6

bills.
MS. FORSTER: Well, Justice Souter, the - the

7
8

problem with that, of course, it's pure speculation, but

9

we don't even know if this glove compartment was locked or

10

unlocked.

11

driver at the time he was asked to retrieve his license

12

and registration.

13

compartment is not clear at all for the record.

14

What we know is that it was opened by the

Whether he had to unlock that glove

QUESTION: Well, we - we don't know that and we

15

don't know whether the armrest had come down during the

16

time the backseat passenger was there.

17

things at a probable cause stage that one does not know,

18

but the very fact - if - if we're going to talk - if we're

19

going to find it significant that something is within

20

reach of one of the passengers or not, I would have

21

supposed that for probable cause purposes, the fact that

22

the money was in reach was a relevant fact.

23

There are lots of

MS. FORSTER: But, Your Honor, I - I think that

24

if we want to speculate that perhaps then we could say

25

that that would be enough, but probable cause requires far

Page 42
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

more than speculation.

2

least of complicity, and we simply don't have the facts in

3

this case that would support that fair probability with

4

respect to Mr. Pringle, because all the record shows is

5

that Mr. Pringle was present in a car where drugs were

6

found hidden.

7

It requires a fair probability, at

And if I may address the common enterprise

8

theory that both the petitioner and the U.S. Solicitor

9

relies on in this case, the problem with the common

10

enterprise theory is that the cases that they cite in

11

support of that involved ongoing criminal activity that

12

was conducted in plain view.

13

case, where the Court found that the weapons, one of which

14

was described as as large as a cannon, that was in plain

15

view of all of the occupants of the car.

16

Houghton case - so it was reasonable in the Ulster County

17

case, or if that had in fact been the issue in that case,

18

which it was not -

You have the Ulster County

And in the

19

QUESTION: Those I just think that - look, it

20

just doesn't strike me as plausible that when you have

21

three people in a car, one of them would stuff some drugs

22

behind an armrest where they're very easy to find, unless

23

he thought the other two were in on it, I mean, unless you

24

thought the other two at least didn't care, and if they

25

didn't care they're out there transporting the drugs with

Page 43
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

them.

2

MS. FORSTER: Well -

3

QUESTION: So - so how - I don't even know, I

4

mean, what I'm struggling for is, that seems like a

5

reasonable inference so how - how do I know, I mean, I'm

6

making this kind of inference.

7

should or not?

How do I know whether I

8

MS. FORSTER: Justice Breyer, the inference that

9

the backseat passenger may stuff the drugs in the armrest

10

QUESTION: Any of the three, I mean, any of them

11
12

might, and why would they?

Why - you'd have to be crazy

13

to be stuffing crack into a car like that without thinking

14

your friends are - have - don't give a damn at the very

15

least -

16

MS. FORSTER: But certainly -

17

QUESTION: - and probably are in on it.

18

QUESTION: But certainly, I think that even if

19

they - he does that in the view of Mr. Pringle, that - so

20

that Mr. Pringle has knowledge that the drugs were shoved

21

in the armrest - that certainly does not also go to the

22

next level, which is that Mr. Pringle possesses those

23

drugs.

24
25

I may see one - a passenger QUESTION: Would - would - would the - the

officer at that point then be able to say, ah, but, in any

Page 44
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

case I could arrest the other two because they're

2

harboring a felon?

3

could maybe arrest the ones who sitting next to the - the

4

other, since the drugs are barely concealed?
MS. FORSTER: Well, no, Your Honor, I - perhaps I

5
6

In other words, you said that you

- I was not clear.
QUESTION: Here's what she's thinking, and there

7
8

might be a million different crimes.

You say to the front

9

seat passenger, everything's the same, but you say to the

10

front seat passenger, Mr. Front Seat Passenger, did you

11

know that there were drugs down there in the armrest?

12

he says yes, and that's all he says.

13

could be arrested then, couldn't he?

And

I would imagine he

14

MS. FORSTER: No, Your Honor, I -

15

QUESTION: You couldn't arrest him then?

16

MS. FORSTER: I don't think he could be arrested.

17

QUESTION: For transporting the drugs or helping

18

to transport them or being an accessory or doing

19

something?
MS. FORSTER: Well, certainly if he's the front

20
21

seat passenger and not the driver he's - he's along for

22

the ride.

He's not necessarily the person transporting -

23
24
25

QUESTION: Well, he doesn't say anything.
don't know anything about it.

We

He just says, sure I knew

Page 45
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

there were drugs back there, that's all.
MS. FORSTER: Under those circumstances, Your

2
3

Honor, I think you'd have a much closer case.
QUESTION: No, no, but - but no, look, either

4
5

there is a crime of being in a car knowing that or there

6

isn't.

Is there or not?

I don't know.

MS. FORSTER: Well, the crime of possession

7
8

requires not just knowledge, but it also requires the

9

intent to exercise dominion and control over the drug.

10

QUESTION: All right, so - so you'd have to then

11

make an inference that a person who says, yes, I knew the

12

drugs where there, was also going to help later on.

13

MS. FORSTER: Yes.

14

QUESTION: All right.

15

MS. FORSTER: - there would have to be some

16

QUESTION: And you think that's not reasonable
either?
MS. FORSTER: I think it is not just on those

19
20

But that's -

reasonable inference -

17
18

That would -

facts alone.

21

QUESTION: Okay.

22

QUESTION: Am I right in assuming that the other

23

two people in the car didn't testify at the suppression

24

hearing?

25

MS. FORSTER: No, they did not, Your Honor.

Page 46
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: Or at the trial?

2

MS. FORSTER: No, Your Honor, nor at the trial.

3

Only Officer Snyder testified at the motion to suppress

4

hearing for the State.

5

If I may go back to the common enterprise

6

theory, as I said, the cases that the State and the U.S.

7

Solicitor rely on here involved criminal activity

8

conducted in plain view, and - which, from which an

9

officer could reasonably infer, I think, a common

10

nefarious enterprise.

11

cocaine in this case that is hidden, hidden, concealed in

12

the backseat armrest, and secondly, again, with respect to

13

this being a commercial quantity of drugs, there is simply

14

nothing in the record that supports that.

15
16

We have a - less than one gram of

This was -

QUESTION: Well, it was in separate little
packets, right?

17

MS. FORSTER: Yes, it was, but that, again -

18

QUESTION: A kind that people would buy for a

19

single dose?

20

MS. FORSTER: That, again, your Honor, is not

21

inconsistent with personal use, and certainly I should

22

think that if this police -

23

QUESTION: Yeah, and one of their charges was

24

possession, was it not?

I mean, we're not dealing only

25

with intent to distribute but -

Page 47
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1
2

MS. FORSTER: That - that is correct.

The charge

was possession -

3

QUESTION: Pure possession is what -

4

MS. FORSTER: - and possession with intent.

5

QUESTION: Well, to say it's not inconsistent

6

with personal use, I don't think gets your client totally

7

off the hook, because something can be both consistent

8

with personal use and consistent with commercial intent.

9

You know, something can - you can infer both ways.

10

MS. FORSTER: However, Justice Rehnquist, here

11

this amount is not indicative of an operation that

12

requires the participation of more than one person.

13

is an amount that, if it's for sale, it's for sale -

14

QUESTION: But - but how about the combination of

15

that with the - with the $763 roll in the glove

16

compartment?

17

This

MS. FORSTER: Well, Your Honor, I think then it

18

would still require speculation on the part of this police

19

officer to assume that one was connected to the other.

20

think that the only common enterprise that reasonably

21

could have been inferred from the facts of this case is a

22

common enterprise to go from one destination to another

23

and nothing more than that, and given the concealed nature

24

of the drugs in this case, the lack of any suspicious

25

activities on Mr. Pringle's part, and the lack of, I

Page 48
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

I

1

think, any reasonable inference pointing to complicity

2

that he possessed the hidden drugs, the Maryland Court of

3

Appeals in this case correctly held that there was no

4

probable cause to arrest Mr. Pringle, and this ruling

5

should be affirmed.

MS. FORSTER: Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GARY E. BAIR

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. BAIR: Thank you, Your Honor.

12

I just wanted

13

to first clarify any record inconsistencies or - or

14

clarifications that might be in order.

15

court of appeals' opinion, which is at appendix page 3A to

16

the petition for cert, makes very clear that the court of

17

appeals, the highest court in Maryland, construed the

18

record as the officer seeing a large amount of money

19

rolled up in the glove compartment, and it totaled $763.

20

That is clearly stated in the court of appeals' opinion,

21

and I would direct the Court's attention to the trial

22

transcripts at pages 83 to 84.

23

appendix but it is in the record in the case, the trial

24

transcript pages 83 to 84 from the trial on April 10th of

25

2000.

I believe that the

It is not in the joint

The police officer who arrested respondent

Page 49
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

1

testified at the trial that he saw a large roll of money

2

in the glove compartment and that it totaled $763, so

3

clearly there is record support and the court of appeals

4

so found.

5

With regard to the glove compartment being

6

closed or locked, there's nothing in the record ever

7

indicating that the glove compartment was locked.

8

the only natural inference from this record is that it was

9

closed at the time the car was stopped.

I think

The officer saw

10

the drug - excuse me - saw the money in the glove

11

compartment when the driver went to retrieve his vehicle

12

registration, and then after the officer obtained consent

13

to search the car, he then opened the glove compartment

14

again and seized the money.

15

I think it's ironic that the rule that is being

16

suggested by respondent is the bright line rule that the

17

driver should always be arrested.

18

absolutely inconsistent with this Court's Fourth Amendment

19

law. In closing, unless the Court has any questions -

I think that's

20

QUESTION: Yeah, I do have one -

21

MR. BAIR: Yes.

22

QUESTION: - which is, I think she said, look,

23

there are three possible inferences.

One is that the

24

passenger had nothing to do with it, didn't know about it.

25

Two is, everybody knew about it but that's all.

Page 50
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th St., NW 4th Floor Washington, DC 20005

And

1

three, they knew about it and wanted to help sell the

2

drugs.

3

great that three isn't probable cause, but about, at least

4

two.

5

All right.

Now, she says, one plus two are so

MR. BAIR: Your Honor, I think all - the nature

6

of probable cause is that the officer is entitled to

7

accept under the totality of the facts any of those

8

inferences.

9
10
11

I think any - any -

QUESTION: Two - two isn't a crime, I mean, if
they just all knew about it?
MR. BAIR: Under Maryland law, they have to have

12

an intent to exercise control over the drugs.

13

simply knew about it, that would not be enough for a

14

conviction, but I think -

15
16
17

QUESTION: It has to be all three - it has to be
three is great enough, so despite one plus two - okay.
MR. BAIR: Yes, but I think for probable cause

18

purposes, clearly that would be sufficient.

19

Your Honor.
