CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

4

now in No. 90 -- it's 02-9065, Shakur Muhammad, also known

5

as John Mease v. Mark Close.

6

Ms. Beckwith.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CORINNE BECKWITH

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MS. BECKWITH: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
The petitioner in this case, Shakur Muhammad, is

12

a state prisoner who has brought a civil rights action

13

alleging that a prison guard framed him on a false

14

disciplinary charge in retaliation for his having

15

exercised his constitutional right to seek redress in the

16

courts for this same prison guard's previous misconduct.

17

For three reasons, this Court should not engraft onto this

18

type of Section 1983 claim a favorable termination

19

requirement that would make this prisoner have to win his

20

claim in another forum before he can seek his remedy in

21

Federal court.

22

First, the favorable termination requirement is

23

a habeas protecting advice - device - that was borne of

24

this Court's recognition that Congress would not have

25

wanted a general civil rights action to be the vehicle for

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

undoing a state criminal judgment, particularly given the

2

more specific habeas exhaustion requirement.

3

Second, extending the favorable termination

4

requirement beyond this original rationale lacks any basis

5

in the statute's terms or history, and it's devoid of the

6

kind of common law pedigree that might suggest Congress

7

envisioned a broader application to cases that do not look

8

like habeas cases in that they don't involve a direct or

9

an indirect challenge to the fact or duration of custody.

10

And finally, any remaining qualms about

11

Congress' intent are resolved by the Prison Litigation

12

Reform Act, where, after carefully weighing the interests

13

of overburdened courts and of prison officials, Congress

14

imposed an administrative exhaustion requirement, not a

15

favorable termination requirement.

16

QUESTION: But I don't understand this about this

17

case.

18

case, and - and it seemed to me what had happened was that

19

the - your client, who's certainly well represented, he is

20

sitting there at lunch and he makes some faces or gestures

21

and the prison guard then has him up for a couple of

22

charges and he basically is acquitted of the more serious

23

one and they punish him for the more - less serious,

24

threatening behavior, no, it's insolence or something like

25

that.

I'm having an awfully hard time understanding this

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

He never says a word about retaliation, never

2

says a word about it.

3

have done, his conviction.

4

authorities, hey, throw this out.

5

based on the guard's desire to retaliate.

6

suddenly have his - not having done any of that, we're in

7

Federal court, and the Federal magistrate says, you know,

8

he has no evidence of retaliation, or at least not enough.

9

He never appeals, which he could
He never says to the prison
The whole thing was
And now

And now we're up here arguing about Heck v.

10

Humphrey, sort of like the Finnegan's Wake of the habeas

11

corpus law, and I - I can't really understand how we even

12

got here.

13

this isn't an unexhausted claim, or at least the

14

magistrate said you don't - your client, unfortunately for

15

him, has not enough evidence.

I - I don't understand why, if you're right,

How do we get into this?

16

QUESTION: Well, I suppose one of the reasons you

17

got into it was that the Sixth Circuit said that you had -

18

had to comply with Heck against Humphrey, and you didn't

19

agree with it.

20

MS. BECKWITH: Well, that's right, and you know,

21

this is undoubtedly a valid First Amendment retaliation

22

claim.

23

know, he - he made perfectly appropriate allegations in

24

the courts against this prison - this prison guard in

25

prior lawsuits, and the guard set out to get him -

The idea here is our - our client is saying, you

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: Can we reach this - I can't reach the

2

Sixth - the question that the circuit thought was here.

3

don't see what we're supposed to say.

4

supposed to say?

5

nonetheless, in 1983 states a claim?

6
7

What are we

That - that this unexhausted claim,

MS. BECKWITH: It's not - I don't believe it's an
-

8
9

I

QUESTION: If I said what I said, is that correct
what I've said?

10

MS. BECKWITH: I don't think so, because it's not

11

an unexhausted claim, and I believe the whole point of

12

this case is the - is the misstatement of the law by the

13

Sixth Circuit that would deem this a non-civil rights

14

claim, basically a habeas claim completely contrary to

15

this Court's precedent in Preiser.

16

Preiser v. Rodriguez, which set up the way, you know,

17

followed up on by Heck v. Humphrey, the way that we decide

18

which way these cases should go.

19

claim?

20

we're worried might swallow the habeas exhaustion

21

requirement?

We have, you know,

Is this a civil rights

It should go through 1983.

Or is it something

22

QUESTION: Well, does the Heck Humphrey issue

23

that comes to us one that is affected by whether good-

24

time credits are lost?

25

MS. BECKWITH: The - whether good-time credits

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

are lost is a - is a consideration and whether this is a

2

fact or duration case.

3

QUESTION: Right.

4

MS. BECKWITH: And this case is nothing about -

5

QUESTION: So after all the briefing, the

6

additional briefing that's gone on, do we know now for

7

sure whether good-time credits are affected here?

8

MS. BECKWITH: I think we do.

9

The most important

point on that question, Justice O'Connor, is something

10

that I - a point I unfortunately made in a footnote

11

instead of in the text, footnote 6 on page 5 of the yellow

12

brief, which I wish had been the first sentence of my

13

issue in bold, and that point is that it doesn't matter,

14

because we're not - no part of our constitutional claim

15

challenges the insolence conviction.

16

QUESTION: But is - is that really the point?

17

It's not what you challenge, it's the implication of what

18

you want to be held.

19

MS. BECKWITH: It - that's right.

20

QUESTION: And those are quite different things.

21

I mean, if in fact good-time credits are lost, even though

22

you are not asking for any adjudication on good-time

23

credits, then it necessarily follows that the length of

24

the sentence can be affected, and it necessarily follows

25

that at some point there could be a habeas claim because

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the individual was not being released.

2

MS. BECKWITH: That's right, but there's nothing

3

about this claim that would ever, you know, ever lead to

4

the result, under the test necessarily imply the

5

invalidity of the deprivation of good-time credits, which,

6

by the way, I don't believe we were deprived of good-time

7

credits, because of the reasons I state in my brief.

8

client is a habitual offender and this claim was not

9

raised in the lower court but -

10

Our

QUESTION: Well, let - let's - could we just make

11

a short excursus there?

12

credits are lost with respect to the minimum sentence, the

13

point of - determining the earliest point at which he

14

could be paroled, isn't it the case under state law that

15

good-time credits still would be applied to the maximum

16

sentence?

17
18
19
20

Assuming that no good-time

MS. BECKWITH: That - that is true.
believe that would ever -

QUESTION: Then - then isn't that the end of your
argument -

21

MS. BECKWITH: I don't think so.

22

QUESTION:

23

I don't

- because doesn't it - I mean, let me

just finish -

24

MS. BECKWITH: Sure.

25

QUESTION: - my - my question so you know where

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I'm going.

If - if - if the good-time credits would apply

2

to the maximum sentence, then it seems to me that if he is

3

not released at the point at which he says he should be

4

entitled to good-time credits, he's got a habeas claim.

5

MS. BECKWITH: I don't think that - I think that

6

that aspect of the claim, you know, aside from waiver and

7

aside from not challenging the conviction that led to the

8

good-time credits, if they exist, is still not true, I

9

don't think.

It - it's too hypothetical.

Most of these

10

cases are like Preiser, where there would be immediate

11

release.

12

Michigan law, so he's not ever going to get out earlier

13

than his minimum.

14

good-time credits.

15

He has to serve his minimum sentence under

He - those will not be shortened by

After that, he's going to see the parole board

16

several times.

17

hits his maximum sentence.

18

actually not be dismissed until his maximum sentence, you

19

know, be discharged as opposed to paroled earlier than

20

that and have his sentence terminated long before his

21

maximum, you know, just makes it impossible that this

22

would be anything but hypothetical -

23

He's going to be 103 years old when he
The likelihood that he would

QUESTION: Well, but for ease of judicial

24

administration, do we really want to have to look at how

25

old he's going to be and all of these things?

Is it not

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

possible to say at the end of the day, good-time credits

2

still apply to the maximum, so you're out of here?

3

MS. BECKWITH: Well, that may be true in another

4

case, but it's not true in our case, because we're not

5

challenging, you know, nothing about our constitutional

6

claim would necessarily imply the invalidity of that

7

insolence conviction.

8

QUESTION: Well, sticking with Justice O'Connor's

9

question, suppose good-time credits were involved here,

10

but insofar as the prisoner is concerned, it was wholly

11

peripheral, and assume that the good-time credits would

12

not click into operation for another 20 years.

13

make sense for us to insist on Heck v. Humphrey in those

14

circumstances?

Would it

15

MS. BECKWITH: In - I mean, I think that - that

16

Preiser created a clean line, and this Court has decided

17

repeatedly that good-time - the loss of good-time credits

18

falls on the fact or duration side of that line, and I

19

think it makes sense to continue to maintain that clean

20

line, and it's the kind of thing where good-time credits

21

are the hard case.

22

There's -

QUESTION: So you think it does - so you think

23

that if good-time credits were unequivocally involved

24

here, that the Heck rule would apply?

25

MS. BECKWITH: I don't - I - I think that's what

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this Court's precedents would suggest.

There might be

2

room for reconsideration of the good-time credits in the

3

future when it - when it starts to get real hypothetical

4

or when there - if there might be some abuses, such as

5

prison, you know, evidence that prisons were, you know,

6

had the perverse incentive of tacking on good-time credits

7

to -

8

QUESTION: Well, this is - this is very strange

9

when we - when the original idea, I thought, of Heck was

10

typing the kind of claim.

11

case, this is not a prison condition case like my dietary

12

law is not observed, am I not getting medical treatment,

13

but it - it is like - there was an analogy to malicious

14

prosecution, and here this has the same flavor, that this

15

is - the complaint is that this guard had it in for me,

16

and there were trumped up charges.

17

I think the Court said in that

And the way you get around - would you say

18

you're not really attacking the insolence, what he - he

19

was convicted, so you're only concerned with the six days

20

pre-hearing detention, but I don't see how you can, in all

21

candor, chop up your complaint that way, because if the

22

officer hadn't been retaliatory, the officer wouldn't have

23

confronted him in the first place, he wouldn't have been

24

insolent, and nothing would happen.

25

is, well, we'll accept the insolence but really we don't

So how you can say

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because this is a retaliation and there never would have

2

been any charge at all.

3

MS. BECKWITH: Well, I - that's - part - along

4

the lines of the argument the respondent makes in trying

5

to use a - sort of a but-for kind of take, or test, or a

6

relevance kind of test, but that is not the test.

7

test is whether the claim, the constitutional claim, would

8

necessarily imply the invalidity of the conviction or

9

sentence -

10
11

The

QUESTION: I - I thought your response to that
was that provocation was no defense to the charge -

12

MS. BECKWITH: That's right.

13

QUESTION: - to the charge of insolence.

14

MS. BECKWITH: The respondent is - is arguing

15

that - that it goes to credibility.

16

enough.

17

Credibility is not

That's about relevance or admissibility.
QUESTION: But is not your position, and I don't

18

know that the other side has contested it, that

19

provocation would not have been a defense to the charge of

20

insolence?

21

MS. BECKWITH: That's right.

22

QUESTION: And therefore, your provocation claim

23
24
25

There's no -

does not invalidate the insolence conviction.
MS. BECKWITH: There's - there's - that's
correct, Justice Scalia.

There's no way of litigating -

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: How - how do I decide that, because

2

that, it seems to me, is why I kept thinking I'm having

3

trouble with this case?

4

MS. BECKWITH: Well -

5

QUESTION: It is inconceivable to me that under

6

any law of any place that if a guard has gone and brought

7

this whole thing about as a way of retaliating against a

8

First Amendment right, I can't imagine a tribunal that

9

wouldn't throw out the whole thing.

I mean, I know you

10

say, oh no, that isn't what they would have done.

11

had gone to that disciplinary body and it said, look, I

12

have proof here that this is total fake by the guard in

13

retaliation for my First Amendment right, what that body

14

would have said is, we convict you still of insolence but

15

not of the greater charge.

16

If he

That to me is inconceivable, but whether that's

17

so or not is a pure matter of state law, and - and it

18

seems to me that this case then turns on a pure matter of

19

state law, because I think if it is totally separate maybe

20

you're right.

21

how you could be right.

22

If it isn't totally separate, I don't see

MS. BECKWITH: And it is.

I have several answer

23

that.

24

the retaliation claim in - in a - in a prison misconduct

25

hearing, just as Rodney King couldn't -

It is totally separate.

You - you can't litigate

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: You couldn't - you couldn't say,

2

hearing examiner in the prison, I want to tell you

3

something.

4

earlier claims against him.

5

about doing that?

6

The guard's doing this because I filed some
What - what would be so hard

MS. BECKWITH: In fact, we actually - the hearing

7

officer himself, in his deposition, which is at joint

8

appendix 102 to 103, indicates he - he - retaliation was

9

not a defense.

10

consider that -

11

It might go to credibility, but he can't

QUESTION: No, but that's a - that's an issue of

12

fact.

13

the same thing that's bothering me, and that is it seems a

14

- it seems like a very strange statement of law to say

15

that there would be no retaliation defense, and if - and

16

yet it seems to me you've got to say that in order to

17

avoid Heck and Humphrey.

18

it?

And the thing that's bothering Justice Breyer is

So what's your basis for saying

Do you have -

19

MS. BECKWITH: It's -

20

QUESTION: - any state law authority for saying

21

that so that we could make that assumption that you are

22

correct in your statement when we decide this case?

23

MS. BECKWITH: To tell you the truth, I just

24

assumed it as - as a logical matter.

25

saying before, Rodney -

It's like, as I was

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: You assumed that in - in the - in the

2

disciplinary proceeding for - that, let's say, in a

3

disciplinary proceeding for insolence, he would not be -

4

the prisoner would not have the opportunity of saying, he

5

got me into this situation in retaliation for filing these

6

actions?

7

You just assumed that?
MS. BECKWITH: Right.

It's just like assault on

8

a police officer.

9

and then you assault that police officer, you - you know,

10

your - your 1983 claim on the illegal arrest is not, you

11

know, it's - it's separate and apart from -

12

QUESTION: But we're talking here about

13

insolence.

14

or other.

15
16

said that QUESTION: Well, is there any state law authority
that we could look to?

19
20

I mean, he gave him a dirty look or something

MS. BECKWITH: The - the hearing officer himself

17
18

If you're arrested because you're black

MS. BECKWITH: I'm not aware of any and I'm sorry
that I -

21

QUESTION: Well, it doesn't seem unreasonable to

22

me.

23

violation for - for whacking a demonstrator cannot please

24

- plead as a defense, I was provoked.

25

you're provoked, you're not supposed to do - do the act,

A police officer who's charged with a civil rights

Doesn't matter if

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and I don't know why it would be any different with - with

2

a prison inmate if - if he was provoked -

3

QUESTION: But he doesn't admit that.

4

QUESTION: - to resist the provocation.

5

MS. BECKWITH: And in any event -

6

QUESTION: What's so unreasonable about that?

7

MS. BECKWITH: - I think that what - whether we

8

challenge the - the misconduct - the result of the

9

misconduct proceeding in this case is really not relevant

10
11

because QUESTION: Well, his - his complaint doesn't say

12

the kind of thing you just said.

13

says, I'm sitting there, the officer made some faces,

14

lured me into this whole thing, and then what he charged

15

me with was false.

16

Justice Ginsburg, I think, was talking about at the

17

beginning.

18

on it, but I saw this being chopped up.

19

incident, it being chopped up as if there were several

20

things, one insolence, one threatening behavior, and then

21

separating that out, and I got totally confused about the

22

Heck v. Humphrey part, the exhaustion part -

23

I think his complaint

So I - I didn't see - it's what

I'm just - maybe you have nothing else to say
I saw one

MS. BECKWITH: The - the complaint is very clear.

24

I mean, the gist - the most tangible part of - of the

25

complaint is that I was overcharged, you know, and I had

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to do pre-hearing detention, six days in pre-hearing

2

detention that I would not otherwise have had to do

3

because this guard was retaliating against me for suing

4

him, for exercising -

5

QUESTION: This is the amended complaint.

It was

6

not his original complaint, and one of the many puzzling

7

features in this case is the Sixth Circuit is addressing

8

the original complaint, where this man says, I want the

9

whole thing expunged, not that, yes, I was insolent, but I

10

wasn't engaged in threatening behavior.

11

complaint said, this officer retaliated against me, the

12

whole thing is no good, court, expunge the discipline.

13

And it was only in the amended complaint that they came up

14

with this theory, oh, insolence was all right, and the

15

only thing that we're attacking is the threatening

16

behavior.

17

The initial

MS. BECKWITH: Well, the two complaints are

18

actually very similar, maybe identical, except for the -

19

removing the request for expungement.

20

Sixth Circuit's -

And, of course, the

21

QUESTION: Well, isn't that a rather significant

22

difference, because that says the whole thing is no good,

23

the insolence is no better than the threatening, the whole

24

thing is no good?

MS. BECKWITH: Mr. Muhammad was - was not

MS. BECKWITH: No.

MS. BECKWITH: Well, it was the complaint that

error, but it's one that didn't matter.

They just made a factual

QUESTION: Nonetheless, they ruled on a complaint
that is not the one he was complaining about.

18

MS. BECKWITH: But - but it doesn't matter,

19

because they relied on Huey v. Stine and the case law in

20

the Sixth Circuit.

21

for expungement or not if you are challenging the result,

which the Sixth Circuit thought -

It wouldn't matter whether you asked

All of this is relevant

Because of the issue of whether he's lost any good-

is preliminary.

and if good-time credits are not at issue, it doesn't

They dispute you, but too late.

If you're right on that point,

10

then it's the easiest case ever, you're obviously right.

If it has nothing to do with good-time credit -

MS. BECKWITH: Well -

- if you can chop up the - the action

in that way, if all you're complaining about is six days

that he spent in pre-trial detention and your winning on

that would have nothing to do with anything else, would

not set aside the rest of the - of the loss of good time

if I may reserve the balance of my time.

11

QUESTION: Very well, Ms. Beckwith.

12

Mr. Casey, we'll hear from you.

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THOMAS L. CASEY

14

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

15
16
17

MR. CASEY: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
I agree this is a very confusing case.

We

18

believe there are several reasons why summary judgment

19

should be affirmed.

20

Muhammad did lose good-time credits, and because the

21

nature of his challenge necessarily implies the invalidity

22

of his misconduct determination, we think this case is

23

controlled by Edwards v. Balisok.

24
25

The first is that because Mr.

QUESTION: Why didn't you waive the question of
good-time credits?

I mean, why - you - you heard the

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

discussion before.

2

MR. CASEY: Yes.

3

QUESTION: Why - why is this something we should

4
5

consider?
MR. CASEY: First of all, we believe it's - it's

6

a matter of straightforward statutory - not even

7

interpretation, just reading the text of the Michigan

8

statutes on good time, so it's not some fact issue that -

9

that can be waived.

Secondly -

10

QUESTION: Excuse me?

11

legal issues can't be waived?

12

Only fact issues can be -

MR. CASEY: No, it's not a legal argument.

This

13

is a straightforward - a straightforward application of

14

the statutory language that says he did lose good time.

15

QUESTION: You did not - did you make the point

16

below that the other side has to lose because he lost

17

good-time credit?

18

MR. CASEY: In our first motion for summary

19

judgment, which was in 1998, we argued that Heck and

20

Edwards controlled the case, that he was in effect

21

challenging his good - or his misconduct hearing

22

determination.

23

denied that motion, saying he is not challenging his

24

misconduct.

25

stand-alone retaliation case.

The magistrate of the district court

They agreed with his theory that this was a
So nobody - neither party

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

nor the district court nor the Sixth Circuit got into the

2

fine points of the argument about whether this was a

3

duration case or a conditions case.

4

QUESTION: Then why isn't it waived?

5

MR. CASEY: Well, we submit it's - it's a

6

straightforward matter.

7

in his opinion or his recommendation denying our motion

8

for summary judgment, was under the impression he did not

9

lose good time.

10

It appears that the magistrate,

QUESTION: Okay.

And let's assume the magistrate

11

was wrong.

12

district court and say, the magistrate is wrong on this

13

point and this point can be dispositive under Heck.

14

correct?

As I understand it, you did not go to the

Am I

15

MR. CASEY: We did not argue it in those terms.

16

We argued, as I say, the broader application of Heck and

17

Edwards to the effect that he was - the nature of his

18

challenge necessarily implied that his -

19

QUESTION: But your position - your position as I

20

understand was that even if he did not lose any good-time

21

credits, that you - nevertheless, Heck controls.

22

MR. CASEY: Yes.

23

QUESTION: And that's the question -

24

QUESTION: And that's what -

25

QUESTION: - on which we granted certiorari.

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

That's the question we - whether a plaintiff who wishes to

2

bring a 1983 suit challenging only the conditions rather

3

than the fact or duration of his confinement must satisfy

4

Heck v. Humphrey.

5

if indeed the duration of his confinement is what is

6

affected.

7

by saying, actually, this question is not even in the

8

case?

9
10

Now, that question is not in the case,

And did you respond in the brief in opposition

MR. CASEY: Yes.

We -

QUESTION: But even if you did, it's not in the

11

case, none of it's in the case on the assumption your

12

colleague there was making, or your opponent.

13

that Mr. Muhammad wins his claim in the 1983 action, which

14

the fact that they thought didn't have enough evidence

15

suggests he wouldn't, but suppose he did.

16

what I've showed was illegal under the Constitution or

17

whatever, was, by being put in confinement for six days

18

before my hearing, and my being charged with threatening

19

behavior, that's it, that's all.

20

beside the point.

21

don't complain about the seven days.

22

about the loss of good time.

23

anything except the six pre-hearing days and the later

24

dropped charge of threatening.

25

Imagine

Then he says,

The rest of it is all

I don't complain about my insolence.

I

I don't complain

I don't complain about

So, if he's right about that, if you can do

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that, if in fact his winning on that in no way calls into

2

question the conviction or the loss of good time or the

3

seven later days for insolence, then under Heck, of course

4

he can bring it.

5

MR. CASEY: Yes, that - that's correct.

6

the favorable termination requirement of Heck only applies

7

when the nature of the challenge necessarily implies -

8
9

QUESTION: Fine.

Heck -

So now I've got to the point

that either she's obviously right or you're obviously

10

right, and what it depends upon is a matter of state law,

11

which is whether, as a matter of state law, should he win

12

this claim, it is true that his showing the retaliation in

13

respect to the six previous days and threatening in no way

14

calls into question the validity of the insolence

15

conviction, the seven days, and the loss of good time.

16

I say, what is the answer to that question of state law?

17

Or a sister concluded - it's fairly obvious under the law

18

that they are separate.

19

So

Now what do you conclude?

MR. CASEY: We argue that they are not separate,

20

that the nature of this challenge does in fact necessarily

21

imply the invalidity of his misconduct determination.

22

What he's challenging in this Federal lawsuit is

23

retaliatory disciplinary action.

24

language that he used in his amended complaint.

25

saying is that the guard acted with an improper motive and

That - that's the
What he's

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that these adverse consequences flowed from that.

The

2

only adverse consequences that he's alleging are involved

3

in the misconduct hearing.

4

fact that he was found guilty of insolence and not

5

threatening behavior has any bearing at all on this

6

question.

7

particular hearing officer felt should be reduced to a

8

lower charge, but the nature of his challenge, if - if Mr.

9

Muhammad is correct that this guard acted

So we don't think that the

It was one incident, one charge that this

10

unconstitutionally, there should not have been any

11

misconduct charges, should not have been a hearing, should

12

not have been any pre-hearing detention or post-hearing

13

punishment.

14

QUESTION: Is - is - is that so?

You - you think

15

it, as a matter of constitutional law, you - you could not

16

- you could not say that a prisoner has no right to

17

threaten a guard even if he - even if he claims to have

18

been provoked or has no right to insolent behavior even if

19

he claims to have been provoked?

20

constitutional law, the prison cannot have such rules?

21

As a matter of

MR. CASEY: The Heck v. Humphrey analysis says

22

that there were certain claims that are not cognizable on

a money damage action under 1983.

24

such a claim.

25

duration of confinement, the loss of good time, then under

Our argument is this is

1

Edwards v. Balisok, termination requires -

2

QUESTION: I'm saying it - it does not affect it

3

if he would have been convicted anyway, and the contention

4

of the other side is that he was guilty of the offense,

5

both the major offense, if he had been guilty of that, and

6

the minor offense, regardless of whether there was

7

provocation on the part of the guard.

8
9

MR. CASEY: Correct.
Our argument is that -

10
11

That - that's his claim.

QUESTION: Well, why - why do you - why do you
assert the opposite?

12

MR. CASEY: Well, that - that implicates the

13

elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution,

14

as discussed in Heck and Edwards, and those elements

15

include favorable termination and probable cause.

16

QUESTION: But I think what you're not - it isn't

17

the issue of whether provocation is a defense to a charge

18

of insolence.

19

whole string never would have happened, nothing would have

20

happened.

21

none of this would have happened, and it's just one

I thought what you were saying is that this

If he - if he establishes the retaliation, then

23

MR. CASEY: Well, if - if he's correct that this

24

retaliation is independent of the hearing process, that's

25

- that's his argument.

Our argument is that the only

thing he's complaining about is the retaliatory action,

2

and the retaliatory action was charging him with

3

misconduct.

4

He -

QUESTION: Is not - not retaliation separate in

5

the hearing process.

6

when the guard looked at him from outside the cafeteria

7

and made faces at him, and then he came in, and then the

8

prisoner stands up and gives him some very dirty looks,

9

according to the guard.

You're saying, is his point that

Now, if you can separate out

10

there the retaliation, if you can separate out there what

11

the guard did by way of retaliation, making some very bad

12

faces through the window, and insolence under state law,

13

which would exist even if the guard were badly motivated

14

in making the bad faces, then you've got your two separate

15

things.

16

MR. CASEY: Under Sixth Circuit law, to establish

17

a claim for retaliation, there has to be protective

18

conduct that the inmate engaged in and there has to be

19

adverse action taken against that plaintiff that would

20

deter a person of ordinary firmness from continuing to

21

engage -

22

QUESTION: Fine.

23

MR. CASEY: But that's -

is that - that - has to do with that -

QUESTION:

not his insolent look.
MR. CASEY: If this situation had proceeded

5

exactly as petitioner alleges up to the point where they

6

were nose to nose for a few seconds and then they had both

7

walked away, there would be no retaliation claim, there

8

would be no constitutional violation at all.

9

thing that gives rise to a constitutional right is the

The only

10

adverse action of charging him with misconduct.

11

why we say that this charge is necessarily implicated in

12

the hearing process.

13

implicates that his misconduct determination is invalid.

That's

It necessary - necessarily

14

If he's right that there should have been no

15

charge at all, if he's right on that, then the Heck v.

16

Humphrey analysis doesn't even come into play.

17

he's wrong on that.

18

right on that and - and ruled against us on our Heck v.

19

Humphrey motion.

20

right on that, that the nature of this challenge does

21

implicate the hearing process, and under Sixth Circuit

22

precedent, they said, therefore, it falls.

23

We think

The - the district court felt he was

24

complaint that looked like it was attacking the whole

3

stage - call to the attention of the Sixth Circuit that it

had addressed the wrong complaint?

5

Why didn't you

MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit issued its order.

6

The petitioner filed a motion for rehearing.

7

court rules, we're not permitted to respond to that, but

8

our argument is that even though the Sixth Circuit -

Under the

QUESTION: You could have made a motion to remand
or something.

11

MR. CASEY: We could have, but we did not.

In

12

retrospect, I wish many things had been done differently

13

in this case.

14

QUESTION: Well, do you aggrieve, looking at the

15

Sixth Circuit opinion, that it was examining the original

16

complaint, not the amended complaint?

17

MR. CASEY: It referred to the original

18

complaint, but the - the holding of the Sixth Circuit on

19

page 106 of the joint appendix, they say in an earlier

20

Sixth Circuit case, and they quote it, in order to grant

21

the plaintiff in this case the release he - relief he

22

seeks, we would have to unwind the judgment of the state

23

agency.

24

judgment.

25

That is the basis on which they affirmed the

QUESTION: I thought you agreed that the Sixth

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

Circuit was looking at the initial, original complaint,

2

not the amended.

3

MR. CASEY: That they - they mentioned the

4

initial complaint and not the amended complaint.

5

correct.

That's

6

QUESTION: Yeah.

7

MR. CASEY: But we believe that the rationale

8

that they used, that his challenge did implicate the

9

validity of his misconduct hearing, is correct on both his

10
11

original complaint and his amended complaint.
QUESTION: May I ask you a hypothetical question?

12

Assume we had the case with the same facts except the

13

remedy a different - if the, say the prison authorities

14

had said you can't use your television set for 30 days and

15

that was the only remedy and otherwise everything else was

16

the same, and he said it was - they did that in

17

retaliation because I exercised my First Amendment rights.

18

If that were the discipline, would Heck v. Humphrey

19

preclude relief in this case?

MR. CASEY: Yes, we believe - that's the question

the Court granted cert on.

agree, Your Honor.

We argue that -

QUESTION: And why would it preclude relief in
that case?

That's what I'd be interested in hearing.

4

MR. CASEY: Because as in the Edwards v. Balisok

5

and - and Heck v. Humphrey, the proper method of analysis

6

is to look to the most closely analogous common law tort,

7

look to traditions of common law, public policy

8

considerations in light of the purposes of Section 1983.

9

In Heck v. Humphrey and Edwards v. Balisok, the Court

10

said, in the prison context - prison disciplinary context,

11

the favorable termination requirement applies.

12

facts of those cases, there was good time involved, so

On the

14

QUESTION: More than the facts of the case, we -

15

the reason we - we - we adopted that common law rule was

16

to prevent a collision between 1983 and habeas corpus law

17

and prevent 1983 from being used as an end-run around

18

habeas corpus limitations.

19

MR. CASEY: Again, on - on the facts of the case,

20

that's - that was the situation presented, because in that

21

case there was a collision between the habeas statutes and

22

the 1983 -

23
24
25

QUESTION: And that collision was - was in the
reasoning of the Court.

It isn't -

MR. CASEY: Yes, it was.

But additional

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

reasoning was based on common law traditions and we argue

2

that that same rationale applies even if good time is not

3

involved, even if it's just conditions of confinement as

4

punishment.

5

QUESTION: So that even if setting a - a ruling

6

in favor of the plaintiff would not in any way call into

7

question the prison disciplinary proceeding, it still

8

should - Heck should still apply?

9

MR. CASEY: No.

11

is invalid, then the Heck v. Humphrey analysis doesn't

apply.

QUESTION: Well, it looked like the Sixth Circuit

19

is on the short side of a five-to-one split among the

courts of appeals on how Heck v. Humphrey is to be

applied, that the Sixth Circuit views it differently than

22

the other circuits that have addressed it.

23

MR. CASEY: I believe that's correct.

24

25

MR. CASEY: I believe that's correct.

QUESTION: - its own Huey decision, and I really

4

thought very likely that was why this Court granted cert

5

here, to see whether the Sixth Circuit rule is out of step

6

with what we said in Heck v. Humphrey.

7

MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit, and all of the

8

court of appeals' decisions that have attempted to apply

9

the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to conditions cases, are

10

necessarily involved in - in extension of the Heck

11

rationale to this other factual context, because Heck and

12

Edwards involved good-time losses.

13

assume that's why the Court took the case.

14

our brief in opposition, we suggested that there are these

15

alternative reasons why the Court should not grant cert.

16

One of them was the loss - that he did in fact lose good

I agree that's - we

10

MR. CASEY: That's - that's correct.

11

QUESTION: - that the Sixth Circuit simply

12

thought that if this individual wins, if Mr. Muhammad

13

wins, they would have to unwind the entire judgment of the

14

hearing, which would include the judgment having to do

15

with insolence.

16

MR. CASEY: That's correct.

17

QUESTION: And so if that's what they base it on

18

-

19

MR. CASEY: That's correct.

20

QUESTION: - is their rule different from that of

21
22

any other circuit?
MR. CASEY: The way the Sixth Circuit is

23

different from most of the other circuits is that they

24

apply the Heck v. Humphrey analysis to punishments of

25

conditions and not just to punishments affecting the

MR. CASEY: The Sixth Circuit applies it to

5

conditions, punishments, and duration punishments.

7

MR. CASEY: What do you mean by a conditions
punishment?

8
9

QUESTION: The - the punishments that Mr.
Muhammad received were the loss of good time, confinement

10

to administrative segregation, essentially remaining in

11

his cell, plus loss of privileges for 30 days. So only the

12

loss of good time affects the duration of his sentence -

13
14

QUESTION: Thus, only the loss of good time could
have been challenged in habeas?

15

MR. CASEY: Correct.

16

QUESTION: And the conditions couldn't have been

challenged in habeas?

18

MR. CASEY: Correct.

MR. CASEY: The distinction in this case -

QUESTION: - that the other circuits think is

MR. CASEY: Correct.

19

QUESTION: That's the difference?

MR. CASEY: Correct.

below that there's no cause of action because there's no

on that ground, did you?

response to the question that the Court granted certiorari

if the only punishment he received affected the conditions

10

look to the traditions of the common law and public policy

The adverse action in this case is not the
The

10

adverse action is charging misconduct, and we say, if he's

11

right in his complaint that there would not have been a

misconduct charge but for this action, that necessarily

13

implies that the misconduct proceeding is invalid, and

14

that triggers the analogy to malicious prosecution and its

15

element of favorable termination.

16

QUESTION: So that you say basically, the

17

importance of Heck and Humphrey here is the way it says

18

you ought to refer to common law analogies in analyzing

19

whether there ought to be a 1983 action, and that has

20

nothing to do in the final analysis with whether there's a

21

collision between habeas corpus and 1983.

22

that is an independent requirement of the way you go about

23

analyzing 1983 actions.

That is an -

24

MR. CASEY: Yes, that's correct.

methodology?

You say the same

methodology applies whether it's just conditions or

5

duration of confinement.

6
7

If it's a -

QUESTION: Are you essentially making an
exhaustion of - of state remedies then?

It seems to me -

8

are you - you're not saying that this person would have

9

no complaint, no Federal complaint, not in habeas, not in

10

1983?

Are you saying that -

11

MR. CASEY: Yes.

12

QUESTION: - or are you saying 1983 is premature?

13

MR. CASEY: If he gets favorable termination.

14
15
16

say QUESTION: Where does he get the favorable
determination?

17

MR. CASEY: The - if he got favorable termination

18

by review of the misconduct - if he - if he had won at the

19

misconduct or if he had appealed and won on appeal, that

20

would be favorable termination.

21

QUESTION: So you're saying essentially he hasn't

22

exhausted his internal administrative remedies, and that's

23

why the 1983 is improper?

24
25

MR. CASEY: We say the - his failure to exhaust
is another independent reason why he does not have -

6

with at least the negative implication of the Federal

MR. CASEY: Well, the - the Court addressed that
