ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In 1967, Congress enacted section 209(a) of the

13

Clean Air Act, which is reproduced in the petitioners'

14

brief at page 1.

15

localities from adopting or attempting even to enforce,

16

quote, any standard relating to the control of emissions

17

from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.

18

That statute prohibits States and their

In this case, a political subdivision of the

19

State of California has adopted fleet rules that prohibit

20

the purchase by certain fleets of various classes of -- of

21

vehicles that are otherwise certified for purchase in the

22

State of California and, indeed, have essentially

23

precluded the purchase by those organizations of diesel-

24

fueled vehicles in toto.

25

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, this is a facial

challenge?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, it is a

facial challenge.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

QUESTION:

Claiming total preemption.
Yes, claiming total preemption.

What if we were to think that at

7

least as applied to the district's own purchases of

8

vehicles, that it could limit itself to what kinds of

9

vehicles it wanted to purchase and therefore is valid at

10
11

least in part?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the -- there are two

12

answers to that.

13

in order to purchase its own vehicles.

14

for adopting a standard that controls that particular

15

situation.

16

One, the district doesn't need a statute

QUESTION:

There is no basis

Well, but let's suppose it wants to

17

establish a standard to apply now and in the future for

18

itself and for any other jurisdiction, public

19

jurisdiction, within its area?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if it goes beyond --

If it's authorized to do that.
Well, if it goes beyond what it

23

wants to purchase itself and imposes requirements on

24

others, then it seems to me that's a standard that falls

25

within the ambit of the preemption.

1

QUESTION:

What if -- what if the State -- what

2

if the State of California says that all of our officials,

3

including the Governor, shall have a low emissions

4

vehicle?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think that -- that there is a

6

serious question as to whether or not that would be

7

preempted.

8

by the particulars of this case.

9

sounds like a --

10

I -- I don't think it's presented, obviously,

QUESTION:

I mean, it still look --

Well, but it seems -- it seems to me

11

that -- that it is from -- from the standpoint of -- of

12

governmentally owned and operated vehicles.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think the answer to the

14

question at the end of the day, Justice Kennedy, would be

15

that you would require a clearer statement from Congress

16

than what you have in section 209(a) to interfere with the

17

kind of purchasing decisions that localities are -- are

18

making in contrast to this.

19

QUESTION:

Right, but -- but it seems to me not

20

-- not an answer to Justice O'Connor's concern to say that

21

it goes beyond the particulars of this case because when

22

you make a facial challenge, you are going beyond the

23

particulars of this case.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:
Scalia.

Well, I understand that, Justice

Well, there are two answers to that, one that I

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

was trying to answer before which is I don't think that

2

this provision actually covers that particular situation

3

because you don't need this provision in order to have

4

authority as a local jurisdiction to make purchases on

5

your own as to what you're going to buy.

6

don't think, a standard within the meaning of the statute.

7

That's not, I

But second of all, I also don't think that the

8

-- it must be unconstitutional in all respects as the

9

controlling standard of law in this particular context

10

either.

11

of this -- of these fleet rules that is preempted, and

12

perhaps all of them are preempted.

13

out at the earliest stages of these proceedings without an

14

opportunity to demonstrate the metes and bounds of the

15

regulations as they would particularly apply at this -- at

16

-- at this particular juncture.

It is clear that there is a significant component

But we were dismissed

17

QUESTION:

No, but we may --

18

QUESTION:

I'm still not sure -- sure where we

19

are.

20

about some private vehicles, trash hauling and airport

21

shuttles, but it also talks about exclusively

22

governmentally owned vehicles.

23

the State can do whatever it has -- whatever standard it

24

wants for its own vehicles.

25

It -- it seemed to me that the regulation talks

MR. PHILLIPS:

And it seemed to me that

Well, our -- our challenge is not

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

intended, frankly, to interfere with the local

2

jurisdiction's ability to purchase their own vehicles on

3

their own behalf.

4

QUESTION:

Local jurisdictions.

I mean, you

5

know, what's that?

Are you saying that it is a standard

6

if the City of Los Angeles has a regulation through the

7

city council that applies to the purchasing of every

8

little local area?

9

a general regulation respecting only governmental

Or suppose the State of California has

10

purchases.

Are you saying right now that all those -- in

11

other words, rules, regulations, standards, practices by

12

the State of California or some part thereof -- that does

13

nothing more than control purchasing by governmental units

14

of that State is fine?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18
19

They can do that.
Yes.

That's what we're saying.

All right.
We don't -- we don't have any

challenge to that.
QUESTION:

In that case we're now down to the

20

possibility that we're talking about some garbage trucks,

21

I think, and some airport vehicles because I think all the

22

rest of it did just involve the State.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, it's difficult to know

24

precisely what the metes and bounds of it is, but the

25

portion of this that offends us and the portion that we

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

think does not require a clearer statement, which is that

2

which goes directly to non-governmental entities.

3

if you're talking about regulating the purchasing choices

4

of pure governmental entities, then you expect Congress to

5

speak with a -- with a clearer voice.

6

If --

But the purpose of these fleet rules is not

7

simply to restrict the purchases by governmental entities.

8

It is quite clear that the purpose of these fleet rules is

9

to regulate the purchasing choices that are made with

10

respect to a much broader scope of purchasing entities,

11

including private entities, and it is that portion of the

12

regulation, frankly, that we are challenging and

13

challenging on its face.

14

QUESTION:

Mr. Carter, if these regulations had

15

been adopted by the State of California rather than a

16

regional district as its 246, in -- in lieu of the Federal

17

plan, would that have been permissible?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Assuming, Justice Ginsburg, that

19

you -- that California took -- complied with all of the

20

requirements of section 246, and there are specific

21

requirements in order to get a -- in the -- in the State

22

action plan that -- State implementation plan that need to

23

be satisfied.

24

envisioned that for States with nonattainment problems,

25

that they would be able to use fleet restrictions as a

But to be sure, the Congress clearly

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1
2

mechanism for promoting their overall emissions quality.
QUESTION:

So your objection is to this on a

3

regional basis.

4

you follow -- I guess you need EPA approval?

5

Statewide you say is permissible provided

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yes, providing you comply with

6

the standards of section 246.

7

QUESTION:

8
9

But -- so -- but the substance of it

would be okay statewide.
MR. PHILLIPS:

So -- so -Well, I don't know if the precise

10

terms of this -- of these rules would qualify under

11

section 246 or not.

12

point, but the truth is it's clear that you could have

13

certain fleet rules implemented that are consistent with

14

section 246.

15

Nobody has actually analyzed that

But realize, Justice Ginsburg, that what -- by

16

saying all our concern is is that every -- every one of

17

thousands of jurisdictions can impose purchase and sale

18

requirements on vehicles --

19
20
21

QUESTION:

Well, it's not sale requirements.

It's a purchase requirement.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, under the respondents'

22

theory of this case which limits the term standards to

23

production mandates imposed on manufacturers, then it

24

seems to me that it clearly extends to all purchases and

25

sales and whether it extends to fleets, it wouldn't --

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it's not limited to fleets at all.

2

theory of this case, the field that has been preempted

3

here really is limited to the manufacturers.

4

every local jurisdiction to come in and bring forth

5

additional requirements is to make a hash out of a scheme

6

that was clearly designed to create a unitary market for

7

the manufacture, sale, purchase, and licensing of new

8

motor vehicles.

9

QUESTION:

Under the respondents'

And to allow

Well, if -- if one local jurisdiction

10

affects other governmental jurisdictions, but the latter

11

don't care, then it's just as if, as the hypothetical just

12

posed, the State had the -- had -- had the rule.

13

Is there sort of an ultra vires component to

14

your argument that this -- that this district here is

15

affecting what other governmental entities can do and

16

that's the problem?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, this Court has long

18

recognized that you can't analyze a preemption case solely

19

on the basis of the single action by a single actor, that

20

in fact you have to consider the possibility that all 50

21

States or, in this case, every local jurisdiction could

22

follow suit.

23

And remember, it's not just follow suit with

24

respect to this kind of fleet rules under the respondents'

25

theory of this case, which is that all purchase and sale

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

restrictions --

2

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I had not understood your

3

argument to be based on any conception that this

4

particular district would be treated differently than the

5

State as a whole, but I -- I -- am I wrong in that?

6

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the State of California

7

would have certain prerogatives, obviously, under the

8

entire scheme that are different, but even if California

9

had simply done what the district did here, which is to

10

just announce a set of fleet rules, not made any effort to

11

comply with 246, not made any effort to comply with

12

section 209(b) --

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, what -- what does -- what does

246 provide?

15

MR. PHILLIPS:

Section 246 provides that in

16

certain nonattainment States, one of the options they have

17

available in order to eliminate the overall -- or to -- to

18

improve the overall ambient air quality is to adopt

19

certain types of fleet rules.

20

lengthy.

21

include that in your State implementation plan.

22

And the provision is very

It's very detailed about -- and you have to

What California did was it used the substitute

23

route and adopted its LEV rules saying that those would be

24

equally effective.

25

QUESTION:

So it didn't comply in your view with

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

246.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, it clearly didn't comply.

I

3

don't think there's any question that California has made

4

no effort to satisfy the Clean Air Act with respect to

5

this.

6

But this Court -QUESTION:

Your -- your argument, as I

7

understand it, going back to your answer to Justice

8

Ginsburg, is that although there is an avenue for the

9

State, as it were, to get where -- where it might want to

10

go on a -- on a fleet policy under 246, the district

11

simply does not have that avenue open to it.

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15
16

Yes, that's absolutely clear.

Yes.
And that's -- and that's part of

the way this entire scheme operates.
QUESTION:

But that gets me back to my question.

17

If we disagree with you, to the extent we think some

18

application of the district's fleet rules are not

19

preempted, then how does that leave your challenge, which

20

is a facial one?

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- I think the answer is

22

that there are various components of the fleet rules, and

23

I think unlike if you're -- if you're seeking pre-

24

enforcement of a statute, where you'd have to find every

25

application of it, the question is are there subcomponents

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of these rules that are properly challengeable and

2

therefore properly enjoinable rather than being allowed to

3

go in.

4

I don't -- I don't understand -QUESTION:

That eliminates the doctrine

5

entirely, I mean, the doctrine that facial challenge has

6

to show the statute is -- is invalid in all its

7

applications.

8

challenging all of its applications.

9

challenging this particular set of applications.

10
11

You could always say, well, we're not
We're -- we're just
I mean,

that -- that -MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, no, Justice Scalia, I think

12

it's a little more complicated than that because what

13

you're really talking about is a -- is a host of rules.

14

And if you look at the appendix to the respondents' brief

15

with all of the rules that are laid out there, there are

16

literally dozens of rules.

17

quote, fleet rules in the sense of recognizing that there

18

are clearly areas of those rules that intrude into

19

preempted Federal activities, it doesn't seem to me that

20

you have to challenge the entirety of the rules.

21

should be entitled to pick those rules that you're going

22

after and a complaint and go forward.

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

And in order to challenge the,

You

And that's --

But --- that's what we've done.

I

understand if you have a simple unitary statute that

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you're challenging, the Salerno rule may suggest that the

2

statute has to be unconstitutional in all its respects,

3

but if you adopted a rule that if part A is good and part

4

B is not good, you should be allowed to -- to challenge

5

part B facially without worrying about part A.

6

QUESTION:

But I thought -- I thought this was

7

the case in -- in which part A applies both to the

8

district, as in Justice O'Connor's question, and to non-

9

governmental entities so that it's not that A applies to

10

-- to one kind of buyer and B to another.

11

there's a rule that applies to buyers.

12

correct me if I'm wrong.

13

effect says, if there is a substantial -- if there is an

14

application of that rule that in a substantial number of

15

cases at least would not be preempted, then isn't that the

16

end of the facial challenge?

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

There's a --

And Justice -- and

Justice O'Connor's question in

And my answer to you is I don't

18

think that's the proper application of Salerno and I don't

19

-- I mean, I recognize --

20

QUESTION:

I'm not applying Salerno.

I'm -- I'm

21

applying a substantial application rather than a one-

22

instance kind of rule.

23

was, well, we don't have to challenge all rules.

24

challenge A but not B.

25

covers the governmental situation and the private

And -- and your answer to that
We could

And my response is the rule that

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

situation is the same rule, and if that rule has a

2

substantial number of constitutional applications or -- or

3

non-preempted applications, doesn't that, in -- in effect,

4

defeat the facial challenge?

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, except for the fact that if

6

-- if we don't get past the ruling of the court below at

7

this stage, which is that none of this is preempted, that

8

-- whether it's a facial challenge or a non-facial

9

challenge, we're going to have rules that are out there

10

that are being implemented at this stage and will be

11

upheld as constitutional under the Ninth Circuit's ruling

12

as the -- as the controlling rule of law, and we won't be

13

in a position even to get at any portion of those rules

14

that are clearly unconstitutional because they --

15

QUESTION:

You can, can you not -- I'm just

16

trying to draw this back because it seems to me you're not

17

challenging the public part.

18

the public part, then -- I've looked at pages 7 and 8 of

19

the SG's brief where he's listed these rules.

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

21

QUESTION:

22

Right.

And I take it what you're challenging

is rule 1194 insofar as it applies to private operators.

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

24

QUESTION:

25

So if you're not challenging

Right.

Rule 1193, the same, and rule 1186.1,

the same, and nothing else.

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

2

QUESTION:

I think that --

In each of those rules, having looked

3

at them, it does say at the beginning, these apply to

4

public and private.

5

and private, written in the text of those rules that

6

you're challenging.

7
8

MR. PHILLIPS:
our primary concern.

9
10

So I take it it's those two words,

QUESTION:

That -- that is our -- I mean,

The -- the problem here is -Well, but that's what you're

challenging, nothing else.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

Well, I mean, the

12

question is whether or not -- I mean, I'm not sure that is

13

precisely what we're challenging.

14

a difference between a public entity deciding on its

15

own --

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

It seems to me there is

Yes.
-- that it will make a certain

18

purchasing decision as a purchasing decision.

19

fundamentally different proposition when another entity

20

demands that it must make a purchasing decision based on

21

emissions control.

22
23

QUESTION:

What do you mean?

There is a

Another public or

private?

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

QUESTION:

A public entity.

Oh.

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PHILLIPS:

What I was saying is -- what --

2

what I meant to answer your question earlier, Justice

3

Breyer, was to say if you're asking me can public entities

4

make purchasing decisions free of the restrictions of the

5

Clean Air Act, I think the answer is yes because I don't

6

think Congress spoke to that.

7

But if what you're saying is can a -- can one

8

governmental entity demand that another governmental

9

entity make a decision for purely environmental reasons

10

and not as a -- as a contracting matter, no.

11

to me is still a standard --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14
15

That seems

Well, now just let's think --- that controls emissions and is

unconstitutional.
QUESTION:

-- of the complexity of State and

16

central government in light of what you just said.

17

saying that the State of California board A couldn't say

18

all the -- I mean, I don't know where to go with this.

19

you see -- do you see the problem?

20

MR. PHILLIPS:

You're

Do

No, but the -- the problem is

21

much simpler than that, Justice Breyer, because there's a

22

scheme in place where if you don't like the way the

23

comment on your adversary's argument that the word

2

standards just refers to numerical figures and so forth

3

and that you -- you have a -- it means the same thing when

4

the government is -- Federal Government is implementing

5

its own standards and it is in this provision.

6

do you have a response to that basic argument?

MR. PHILLIPS:

Do you --

So there -- there are two answers

to that.

mandates, those kinds of numerical standards, even -- even

One, section 202 is not limited to production

10

within 202.

11

Congress used about standards relating to the control of

12

emissions is inherently broader than 202 in any event, and

13

if you expected 209 and 202 to be read in para materia,

14

you would have expected Congress to cross reference.

Yes.

QUESTION:

What about the distinction between

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, the use of requirement in

with standardless obstacles to implementation.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE B. OLSON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

9

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

10
11

MR. OLSON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

12

The South Coast rules prohibit the purchase of

13

certain motor vehicles and require the purchase of others

14

based on explicit emission standards.

15

reasoning, every other State and local government agency

16

in the United States could adopt its own individual and

17

unique blend of prohibited and permitted motor vehicles.

18

But --

19

QUESTION:

Under respondents'

General Olson, does -- does the

20

Government take the position that petitioner has just

21

taken, that these rules are invalid even insofar as they

22

apply to governmental subdivisions in California?

23

MR. OLSON:

I think the answer is -- is no, but

24

let me explain, that to the extent that agencies of

25

government, the State or subdivisions, are purchasing

unconstitutional.

They can purchase --

QUESTION:

No, no.

I'm not talking about

4

whether their doing of it is unconstitutional.

5

the State's -- whether the State's prescribing that they

6

do it violates the statute.

7

MR. OLSON:

Whether

Our -- our position -- I don't --

8

I'm not sure I know the answer to that because I don't

9

know what authority this agency has with respect to

10

requiring different units of -- of the government of the

11

State of California to purchase or not purchase vehicles.

12

And it hasn't -- it's not a subject that was briefed, if

13

at all, extensively in the briefs.

14

But the -- the force -- the force of the

15

preemption provision here is that Congress determined that

16

there should be a uniform standard with respect to

17

controls on the emissions of motor vehicles.

18

was given an exception provided that certain requirements

19

were met.

20

be submitted to the EPA and approved under a process

21

that's open and transparent and allows the national agency

22

to make sure that there are uniform standards that can be

23

met that also comply with the requirement that the

24

national economy not be disrupted, so that there would be

25

different -- by different standards in every little

QUESTION:

That's the thrust --

Has it happened, General Olson?

One

pier that you raise is if -- that -- if this district can

have these fleet rules, so can every district in the

5

country, and these -- these rules have been in operation

6

now for some years.

7

copied what this one has done?

MR. OLSON:

The

-- the district was given the authority to adopt these

11

rules in 1987, if I'm correct, did not adopt them until

12

the year 2000.

13

The arguments -- the principal arguments that

14

are made by respondents that standards are production

15

mandates finds no basis in the statute.

16

section 202 or section 209 is not so limited.

The language of
The -- what

And there should be no mistake about it.

These

20

fleet rules are directly related to emission standards.

21

One of them, for example, rule 1194, uses the phrase,

emission standards, 12 times and it requires all

23

purchasers to be vehicles that meet certain emission

24

standards, adopting by reference the State of California

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

17

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

18
19
20

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The question in this case is whether section

21

209(a) of the Clean Air Act, which is reproduced at page

22

36a of our brief, preempts very modest fleet purchase

23

rules which apply only to vehicles that are already

24

commercially available, that is, that cannot have an

25

effect on manufacture -- cannot require manufacturers to

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

produce or sell anything, and which were adopted by a

2

unique airshed in which 90 percent of all toxic air

3

pollution derives from motor vehicles.

4

And the answer to that question is no because

5

the text and the context of the Clean Air Act, title II of

6

the Clean Air Act that deals with motor vehicles, show

7

that Congress intended the word standard in section 209 to

8

be used in the same way that it is used in section 202

9

and, indeed, throughout the entirety of title II -- title

10

II.

11

section 202 alone, and every single time that it is used

12

there, it is used to refer to an obligation placed on

13

manufacturers, that the vehicles they produce and sell

14

meet specified emissions characteristics.

15

that that definition, the way the word is used in section

16

202, covers the rules in this case.

It's used 100 times, I'm told by an amicus, in

2

sellers.

3

And in fact, if you look at section 203 of the

4

act, which is called Prohibited Acts -- it's the

5

enforcement provisions -- it is directed at manufacturers

6

and sellers.

7

QUESTION:

I agree with you completely that the

8

statute imposes these obligations on the manufacturers to

9

comply with the standards.

But the word standard is -- is

10

a different concept from the obligation to comply with the

11

standard.

12

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, I think the -- the word

13

standard -- I'll -- I'll say this one more time and then

14

retreat to another -- another argument.

15

standard, as it is used, for example, in 202(g), is used

16

both to refer to the emissions characteristics, numerical

17

or otherwise, and an obligation placed on manufacturers

18

and sellers to do something about that.

And the -- let me -- let me give you my second
line of argument here -QUESTION:

Excuse me.

23

it was just manufacturers.

24
25

The word

Now you say it's not just

It's manufacturers and sellers.

MR. WAXMAN:

I thought

Well, there are provisions in

section 203, which is the Prohibited Acts, that it -- it

34
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is imposed on the people who make cars and requires them

2

or limits them in what those people can make.

3

QUESTION:

I mean, it -- it's hard enough to say

4

that the word standards on its own is automatically

5

limited to manufacturers, but it's doubly hard to say it

6

is limited not to just to manufacturers, but to

7

manufacturers and sellers, but not to manufacturers,

8

sellers, and purchasers.

9

MR. WAXMAN:

It -- it is -- Justice Scalia,

10

there is a provision in section 203 of the act, the

11

Prohibited Acts, that deals with the instance in which a

12

manufacturer, for example, produces cars overseas and then

13

tries to sell noncompliant cars through a distributor or

14

some other entity.

15

Those people are covered.

But when Congress considered in 1990 its own

16

fleet purchase rules, we're talking here about very

17

limited fleet purchase rules that -- talking about my

18

rules -- have a commercial availability exception.

19

do not -- they cannot be read to require manufacturers to

20

make anything they don't make or sellers to sell anything

21

they don't sell.

22

QUESTION:

They

Yes, but as soon as there's -- as

23

soon as there's one commercial vehicle available, that's

24

going to have effect on the manufacturing.

difficult to get.

MR. WAXMAN:

There -- the petitioner does not

page 8 of their brief is truly the 13th chime of the clock

12

told by my client that these exemptions are sought for

13

some of these rules never because the vehicles are -- are

But my point generally about the -- the meaning

12

of the word standard in the Federal act, title II, is in

13

1990 Congress enacted its own fleet purchasing rules, and

14

they are codified in --

15

17

QUESTION:

When you say its own, you mean fleets

that were going to serve Congress?
MR. WAXMAN:

No, no.

Congress put into --

amended the Clean Air Act to require certain States that

19

have nonattainment areas to include within their State

20

implementation plans either a fleet -- a set of fleet

21

purchase rules or some alternative that they would propose

22

that would be equally efficacious in cleaning the air.

23

QUESTION:

Just to be clear on your position, do

24

you think that California as a State could enact a law

25

saying that no purchaser of a motor vehicle in California

MR. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

MR. WAXMAN:

I --

Is that -- is that preempted or not?
It is not expressly preempted by

5

section 209(a).

preemption principles, as this Court went through in Geier

7

v. American Honda, if it could be shown that --

It would be subject to conflict

8

QUESTION:

9

preempted or not in your view?

10

Well, by any theory.

MR. WAXMAN:

Is that

I think -- I think it may well be

11

preempted by -- under conflict preemption principles, not

12

express preemption, if it could be shown that this is

13

really a sales or production -- this is really an

14

obligation that is masquerading as a purchase requirement.

15

That would be the analysis --

16

QUESTION:

Nobody can buy a gasoline-powered

17

vehicle in California would require the manufacturers

18

totally to dramatically change the kinds of vehicles they

19

produce.

20

MR. WAXMAN:

21

QUESTION:

To be sure --

So why wouldn't it fall right within

22

the word standard relating to the control of emissions for

23

motor vehicles?

24

MR. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

Because standards, as I said --

That isn't a standard?

6

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

It's not a standard?
That is correct.

Because?
A standard is -- is a requirement

7

that is imposed on manufacturers and that distinction is

8

drawn throughout title II --

9

QUESTION:

Well, it is a -- what -- what do you

10

do with 209(b) which says -- it -- it authorizes EPA to

11

waive application of 209(a) in the case of, quote, any

12

State which has adopted standards, other than crank case

13

emission standards, for the control of emissions from new

14

motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines?

15

Now, most of the States do not have automobile

16

manufacturers located within the States.

17

possibly impose a requirement on automobile manufacturers?

18

It is obviously referring to State standards that deal

19

with the operators of -- of cars -- you have to go in and

20

-- and have your -- your emissions checked -- or the -- or

21

the purchases of cars.

22

MR. WAXMAN:

How could they

Justice Scalia, it's -- I actually

23

think that 209(b) is important proof for our premise that

24

section 209(a), the word standard, has to be read -- it

25

has to be read to be used in the same way as section 202.

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And clearly the way that -- when I -- when we

2

talk about production mandates, I -- it's -- it's actually

3

the Congress in section 249(h) used the word production or

4

sales mandates.

5

that was submitted under a primary jurisdiction referral

6

to the First Circuit talks about production requirements.

7

It's shorthand.

8
9

The EPA in its rules and in its letter

But I readily agree that when 209(b) or 209(a)
or 202 apply -- when I'm talking about production

10

mandates, I'm talking about an obligation that's placed on

11

the manufacturers about what they produce and can sell.

12

It's one and the same.

13

would try and sell what they produced and they would

14

produce the things that they want to sell.

15

There was a presumption that they

The point is that in -- when Congress enacted

16

the Federal fleet purchase program, it drew a -- the same

17

distinction that is shot through title II between

18

standards, which has a very limited meaning, and

19

requirements.

20

116 of the act, which is on page 3a of our appendix, that

21

preserves State authorities.

22

what the EPA said and what Senator Levin, who was very

23

ably representing the interests of Detroit in 1990, said

24

is these fleet purchase rules, because they are directed

25

at purchasers may very well have a tremendous impact on

It's a distinction that exists in section

they are different than production standards, production

They may cause a race to the top.

QUESTION:

But

I -- I don't understand your response

6

to my question.

7

that standards always refer to manufacturing standards.

8

But in 209(b), they clearly do not refer to manufacturing

standards.

My question is -- you just said again,

MR. WAXMAN:

My submission to the Court, Your

5

Honor, is that standards, as the term is used throughout

6

title II, refers to the supply side of motor vehicles, the

7

people who make them and the people who sell them, and

8

that when Congress wanted to make a rule that dealt with

purchasers, which applies only indirectly against

10

it's tremendously revealing, in terms of the purposes,

11

what Congress intended by standard in 209, to understand

12

that in 1963 Congress enacted the first version of the

do their part in cleaning up the air.

16

And it basically didn't authorize the

MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, indeed.

Yes.

QUESTION:

And -- and I thought your answer to

2

that was because you don't have to buy anything that is

3

not commercially available, that nixes the third car

4

effect argument, and therefore there isn't preemption.

5

MR. WAXMAN:

6

QUESTION:

That is absolutely correct.

No, but that's completely wrong in

7

principle for the reason that the rules don't talk about

8

commercial availability but in averages.

10

MR. WAXMAN:
QUESTION:

No.

So, in fact, if they're only supposed

11

to make three ZEV's -- see, they're only supposed to make

12

three ZEV's.

13

could have a rule say buy only ZEV's and that would be a

14

major change in the EPA rule.

ZEV is commercially available.

MR. WAXMAN:

(Laughter.)

19

MR. WAXMAN:

But you

With respect, Justice Breyer --

Yes.
Here you are completely off base.

The rules each -- I'm not talking

20

about CARB's statewide standards, but the rules challenged

21

here have an exception for anytime somebody can show that

22

the vehicle they want is either not commercially available

23

or can't be used.

24
25

Look at page 50a of the joint appendix.
rules are all in the joint appendix.

The

That happens to be

the rule that deals with the one that my book opened up

2

to.

3

appendix that this -- an exception -- an exemption to

4

these fleet purchase rules where no alternative-fuel

5

engine and chassis configuration is available commercially

6

or could be used.

7

It's buses.

And it says on page 50 of the joint

And so this is the situation that -- our

8

submission is that these things can't possibly have --

9

impose a mandate on manufacturers.

And in fact, look --

10

we -- we discuss in our brief a little bit that California

11

has a program where it provides, I think, a 75 or 90

12

percent rebate to school districts if they buy buses that

13

are fueled by alternative-fuel vehicles.

14

going to have an effect on the kinds of buses that school

15

districts buy?

16

effect on manufacturers?

17

Of course.

Now, is that

And is it going to have a big

Sure.

And therefore, when we're talking about

18

something that is mandatory, as opposed to something that

19

is voluntary, they -- on page 7 of their reply brief, they

20

make a distinction between voluntary standards and

21

mandatory standards.

22

is the perspective of the manufacturer, they are the same,

23

as Senator Levin and the EPA explained.

24

the manufacturers through the market.

25

From the relevant perspective, that

They operate on

Now, to be sure, there -- you can come up and I

51

1

think Justice O'Connor came up with the extreme example of

2

no one in our State can buy a diesel vehicle.

3

I'm saying is that one could argue and one might make a

4

very good argument that if it is a mandate that's imposed

5

on manufacturers or sellers that is masquerading as a

6

purchase rule, where it really has that effect, you may

7

find that substance will prevail over form, or you may

8

find -- I think it would be more appropriate -- that this

9

simply conflicts with the fundamental objective of the

10
11

Clean Air Act under the Hines v. Davidovitz test.
But that's not the challenge that was brought

12

here, and that's --

13

QUESTION:

14

express preemption.

15

And what

It would be conflict preemption, not

MR. WAXMAN:

Conflict preemption and not express

16

preemption.

17

of analysis will allow the courts to deal with this parade

18

of horribles that has never come true and may never come

19

true if the political branches don't.

20

And that will -- that analysis and that mode

But if you look at the history of what was going

21

on in 1965 or 1967 -- this is Congress' purpose -- no one

22

was talking about -- no manufacturers were concerned about

23

purchase rules.

24

engineer and manufacture a third vehicle.

25

They were concerned about having to

But if you need -- if you need

conflict preemption to answer such a basic hypothetical as

2

that put by Justice O'Connor, the statute doesn't mean

3

very much.

4

MR. WAXMAN:

Oh, I think -- no, no, no.

With --

5

with respect, this -- this statute shut down cold, Justice

6

Kennedy, precisely what was going on in 1967.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

14

Let me start with Justice O'Connor's

15

hypothetical.

16

year-old would have a hard time understanding that a flat

17

ban on all gasoline-fueled engines in the State of

18

California is not a standard relating to the control of

19

emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle

20

engines.

21

We are told in language that I think a 6-

Justice Kennedy is absolutely right.

It has

22

rendered the scope of preemption.

preemption.

24

preemption that is created under that interpretation.

25

It's not consistent with the language of the word

There is no field of

standard.

2

It's not simply how it gets enforced.

3

Justice Stevens is clearly correct in that regard.

4

Standard means more than what manufacturers do.
It's broader, and

The one provision that seems to have gotten lost

5

in the -- in all of this, which I think is terribly

6

important, is section 177 which states that State -- and

7

this is at the -- the respondents' brief's appendix at 4a

8

-- 4a.

9

directly or indirectly the manufacture or sale of a new

The States are not authorized to prohibit or limit

10

motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine that is certified in

11

California.

12

That is precisely what is being done here, is

13

that vehicles that are certified in California are

14

prohibited by a subagency.

15

which is why I submit the answer to your question, Justice

16

Scalia, is the State wouldn't have the authority to place

17

the kind of restriction on its own subentities without

18

running afoul of section 177.

19

could get approval for that would be to go to the EPA in

20

the way that Justice Breyer has already described.

21

QUESTION:

The State can't even do this,

And the only way California

Mr. Carter, Mr. Waxman said in his

22

brief that the position he's taking is the position that

23

EPA takes, and EPA is not with us this morning.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, I believe EPA is very much

with us this morning because the Solicitor General speaks

United States Government.

absolutely clear, Justice Ginsburg --

QUESTION:

And -- and the EPA has made it

So you -- you say that's just wrong

when --

MR. PHILLIPS:

Oh, absolutely that's just wrong.

7

There is no -- there is no way -- I have seen nothing to

8

justify departing from what the Government's brief says.

Phillips.
