ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. HARDY MYERS

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. MYERS: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:

10

When a state prisoner decides to attack his

11

conviction on the basis of a claimed violation of Federal

12

constitutional right, your cases have held that he must

13

first alert the state courts he is raising a Federal

14

claim, if that claim is to be exhausted for Federal habeas

15

purposes.

16

courts to tell them he is raising a Federal claim

17

continues to be a - a troubled area of Federal habeas law.

18

It is one that has divided the circuits and is producing

19

very different analyses and results.

But what the prisoner must say to the state

20

Some cases are holding that the prisoner must

21

make some explicit citation or reference to the Federal

22

source of his claim.

23

Federal claim has been fairly presented even when - even

24

though what the prisoner is saying to the state courts

25

could as - as - as reasonably be interpreted as stating a

Some cases are holding that a

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

state law claim.

And some courts have held that a Federal

2

claim is fairly presented even when the statement of the

3

claim is clearly a claim under state law only.

4

This continuing - and in this - in this case -

5

QUESTION: Well, we're reviewing a Ninth Circuit

6

holding, which seems fairly open-ended.

7

characterize the Ninth Circuit rule?

8
9

How would you

MR. MYERS: Your Honor, I was about to describe
it is a transformation of the responsibility of the state

10

prisoner to present his claim, a transformation of that

11

into a responsibility of the - of the state court - state

12

courts to, in effect, step into the shoes of the state

13

prisoner and complete or try to complete an incompletely

14

presented claim.

15

This - this overall division among the circuits

16

and this case from the Ninth Circuit, we think, Your

17

Honors, illustrates or confirms very strongly the need for

18

further clarification by this Court as to exactly what

19

must be said by -

20

QUESTION: Well, do you agree with your opponents

21

here on at least some of the ground rules that would

22

suffice?

23

constitutional provision or a Federal statute or other

24

provision describing the right as Federal?

25

agreement that would do?

I mean, is it enough to cite a Federal

You're both in

1
2

MR. MYERS: Yes.

We believe that is so, so long

as -

3

QUESTION: How about if you cite at least a - a

4

reported case that has decided the claim on a Federal

5

basis?

You make your claim and cite a case that -

6

MR. MYERS: Yes -

7

QUESTION: - clearly has decided the claim on a

8

Federal basis.

9

would do?

Is that - you're both in agreement that

10

MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honors, so -

11

QUESTION: And what if a - a claim is spelled out

12

that necessarily must be based on a Federal right to exist

13

at all?

14
15
16

MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor, that is part of the
test that we propose QUESTION: Why yes?

I don't understand that.

17

mean, why is it necessarily a Federal claim?

18

necessarily a Federal claim only if it's a valid claim.

19

It might be an erroneous state claim.

20

It's

MR. MYERS: Well, we are referring to

21

necessarily, Your Honor, in the sense that the - the

22

source of the claim, that is its Federal source, is -

23

QUESTION: Who -

24

QUESTION: But the - the -

25

MR. MYERS: - is unmistake 5

I

1

QUESTION: He hasn't read the state constitution.

2

He - he makes a due process claim.

3

going to say, since there is no Due Process Clause in the

4

state constitution, but there is in the Federal

5

Constitution, we must assume it's a Federal claim.

6

It may be an erroneous state claim.

7
8

Now, you're - you're

Why?

MR. MYERS: Your Honor, we think that the state
court -

9

QUESTION: And I don't want to have to go through

10

the trouble of figuring out whether there's a valid state

11

claim.

12

court every time there's such a claim to go through state

13

law and determine whether there is anything to this under

14

state law.

15

mean, why aren't your first two requirements enough?

16

at - cite a Federal case, cite a Federal provision.

17

is this an enormous burden?

I - I mean, this is going to require a Federal

18
19

Why, I
Look
Is -

MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor, and we would be quite
content -

20

QUESTION: So why do you want to add anything to

21

it?

22

that.

23

Why should - why should we do that?

I - I don't - I don't really understand going beyond

QUESTION: Let me ask you the other - the

24

contrary question.

Suppose the - the prisoner alleges, I

25

had a lawyer who didn't even graduate from law school, and
6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because I had such a law - lousy lawyer, I lost the case

2

and I'm in jail, and I would be innocent if I were not in

3

jail, but he doesn't cite any cases or any constitutional

4

provision.

Would that have - present a Federal claim?

5

MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION: You don't think so?

7

MR. MYERS: Not - not necessarily -

8

QUESTION: Yeah, but if he added, and therefore,

9
10
11

Inasmuch as -

it violated the Federal Constitution, then it would be a
Federal claim?
MR. MYERS: Your Honor, it would - the - a

12

Federal source of the claim would have been identified,

13

but, of course, whatever further clarification the Court

14

might consider adopting or adopt, the balance of the

15

statement of the claim also has to meet the requirements

16

of fair presentation.

17

QUESTION: But why - why doesn't the state judge

18

know he's raising a claim of inadequate assistance of

19

counsel that violates the Federal Constitution?

20

that give the state judge a fair opportunity to decide the

21

Federal question?

22

Doesn't

MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor, because the

23

description of the claim that you just gave, apart from

24

whether it's factually adequate or whatever could as -

25

could equally address, or state a claim under state law.
7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: Well, certainly -

2

QUESTION: But that anybody knows -

3

QUESTION: - but the question is whether it

4

states a Federal claim that has been exhausted.

5

it also state a Federal claim?

Doesn't

6

MR. MYERS: Not necessarily, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION: I - I thought the Federal standards -

8

and I was going to get into this, but let's do it in

9

relation to Justice Stevens' hypothetical - I thought the

10

Federal standards and the state standards for adequate

11

assistance of counsel were - were in substance the same,

12

and in, you know, in Oregon.

13

same, why is it unfair to the state or to the state courts

14

to construe a - a - a statement like the one Justice

15

Stevens just read, as stating a Federal as well as a state

16

claim?

17

how it construes it.

18

And - and if they are the

The court is going to do the same thing no matter

MR. MYERS: Your Honor, when state judicial

19

authority is invoked to address a claim before it, it's of

20

paramount importance for that court to know whether it is

21

addressing a state claim -

22

QUESTION: No, my -

23

QUESTION: Well, we - we need to lay down a rule,

24

I think, that is - can be applied generally and not just

25

to Oregon, so that, of course, a peculiarity of Oregon law
8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ought not to control what we're trying to do in making a

2

more general statement.

3

MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor, and I would like to -

4

QUESTION: May - maybe I didn't make my - my

5

point.

6

matter of fact, which under the law of the state and the

7

law of the United States is governed by identical

8

standards, what is unfair about construing that as a

9

Federal as well as a state claim, regardless of what label

10

My - my point was, if a claim is stated as a

is put on it?

11

MR. MYERS: And, Your Honor, as I was saying a

12

few moments ago, it - the answer to that goes to the fact

13

- or rests on the fact that the state court's authority to

14

address a state law-based claim is very different, of

15

course, from its authority to address a Federal law-based

16

claim.

17

law claim any way it - it thinks is correct under state

18

law.

19

claim, follow the precedents faithfully of this Court -

20

It has the ability to judge and decide the state

It must, of course, in the relation to a Federal

QUESTION: No, but I'm - my - the - the - my - my

21

question assumed that the - that the substantive law

22

governing the claim was the same under - under the state

23

system and under the Federal system.

24

that you're going to get the same result, and the result

25

is going to be equally right or equally wrong, regardless

So my assumption is

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of - of - of whether you construe it as a state claim and

2

a Federal claim.

3

MR. MYERS: But, Your Honor, the - the - the

4

authority issue is crucial, because if the state court

5

does not know whether it, in fact, has a state law claim

6

before it, it does not know whether it has the prerogative

7

in that case to change the rule.

8

QUESTION: Suppose -

9

QUESTION: Well, it -

10

QUESTION: - Oregon had said in prior decisions,

11

as states sometimes do in dealing with constitutional

12

provisions, we interpret inadequate assistance of counsel

13

in our state to be strictly in tune with the way the

14

Supreme Court interprets inadequate or ineffective

15

assistance of counsel.

16

same, identical, to the Federal, so there isn't any doubt

17

about there being a difference between the state law and

18

the Federal law.

19

we take our lead from the Federal definition.

20

That is, our state standard is the

The - the state supreme court has said,

MR. MYERS: Your Honor, I - I would still assert

21

respectfully that the - the - the clarity with which the

22

claim is presented in terms of making clear whether there

23

is a state claim or a Federal claim present is still of

24

great importance, because the state court can still change

25

its decision with respect to the state claim if it is a
10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

state claim.

2

QUESTION: Sure it can, but the question is, what

3

does it know when it sets out to adjudicate the case?

4

it fairly on notice at day one on a premise like Justice

5

Ginsburg's that the claim is equally state or Federal?

6

And it seems to me that on a premise like hers, of course

7

the state can fairly say the law is the same, doesn't

8

matter at this point whether - whether I call it state or

9

whether I call it Federal, so it's fair to assume it's

10
11

Is

both.
If the state court, let's say the state supreme

12

court, later on says, we think we'll change our rule, then

13

all the state court has to do is to say, the claim is

14

either good or bad under Federal law and this - the result

15

is now going to be different under state law.

16

state courts at each stage on a premise like Justice

17

Ginsburg is fairly on notice of what it has to decide.

18

There's no unfairness to it.

19

getting at, and I - and I don't understand your answer

20

when you say it's important for them to know the source if

21

there's no unfairness.

But the

That's the point that we're

22

MR. MYERS: Well, Your Honor, with respect, we do

23

think that there is unfairness if it is not absolutely and

24

explicitly clear to the court that a Federal claim is

25

being presented by a state court.

2

QUESTION: You mean because it's just nice to
know?

3

MR. MYERS: No, because it -

4

QUESTION: It doesn't make any difference in the

5

law.

It doesn't make any difference in - in the standards

6

by which they would go about adjudicating it.

7

MR. MYERS: But it could, in the sense that they

8

might want to change their position or interpretation with

9

respect to state law.

10

QUESTION: Yes, but that - the change in position

11

to allow the claim.

But we're only concerned with cases

12

in which the state has denied relief.

13

the state grants relief, there's no exhaustion problem.

14

He got the relief.

If you could - if

15

MR. MYERS: That's true, Your Honor.

16

QUESTION: And so if he's denied relief without

17

knowing whether it's Federal or state, is there any

18

possibility that if it were refiled, and clearly named

19

Federal Constitution as the background, he would then

20

grant relief?

21
22

MR. MYERS: I'm not sure, Your Honor.

I don't

think so.

23

QUESTION: I don't see how it could possibly

24

happen.

If the rules are the same, he made a

25

conscientious examination, they claim, and said, you lose.
12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

If he came back and added the words, cited some Federal

2

case, he'd still lose.

3

opportunity to consider that claim and the interests of

4

Federal is in par not, why are they not accommodated by

5

that - by just saying, if you - if you made a claim that's

6

clearly Federal on its facts and you've had a chance to

7

decide it, why - why shouldn't that - that not count - be

8

sufficient exhaustion?

9

So why hasn't the state had a fair

MR. MYERS: Well, because we think at - again,

10

Your Honor, we think - not only do I still feel the

11

authority issue, very respectfully, is important, but also

12

our whole approach toward fair presentation of Federal

13

claims places a choice on the petitioner to make as to

14

whether or not to assert a Federal claim.

15

QUESTION: General Myers, doesn't the burden on

16

the habeas court have anything to do with this?

17

this hypothesis is adopted, the habeas court will have to,

18

I suppose, consider the facts and determine whether that

19

statement of facts makes out a Federal claim or not, thing

20

one.

21

to examine state court, a state law, to assure itself that

22

state law and Federal law, with regard to this matter, are

23

exactly the same.

24
25

If - if

Thing two, the Federal habeas court will then have

And all of this is in order to save the habeas
petitioner what burden?

claim when he files his - his complaint.

What - does it

2

seem to you a close question who should bear that burden?

3

MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION: How often are these habeas -

5

MR. MYERS: There is -

6

QUESTION:

- petitioners represented by counsel

7

in Oregon?

8

for Federal habeas petitioners?

9

Is this - are - is counsel regularly appointed

MR. MYERS: For Federal habeas?

10

QUESTION: Right.

11

MR. MYERS: Yes, I - well, like indigent Federal

12

habeas, yes, I believe so, Your Honor.

13

QUESTION: You don't know that?

14

QUESTION: In - in the state courts?

15

MR. MYERS: Oh, I'm sorry.

16

QUESTION: In - in the Federal court you think

17

I - I -

they're routinely appointed by the state?

20

MR. MYERS: In Federal court, no, Your Honor.

21

They - they are -

QUESTION: No.

23

MR. MYERS: They would -

24

QUESTION: It would be up to the Federal rules.

25

MR. MYERS: - they would probably be Federal,
14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

yes.

But they are -

2

QUESTION: And must - must the petitioner seeking

3

habeas relief also fairly present the factual basis for

4

the claim?

5

MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.

6

QUESTION: Was that done here?

7

MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.

8

QUESTION: And did the state point that out

9

alone?

10

MR. MYERS: No, Your Honor.

In the - in the

11

habeas proceedings in the district court, we focused

12

solely on the issue of the adequacy of that - of the

13

identification of the claim as Federal in nature.

14

QUESTION: Well, but if the petition contains no

15

facts, you wouldn't point that out?

16

understand.

I - I don't

17

MR. MYERS: Your Honor -

18

QUESTION: Why wouldn't you say, but there are no

19
20

facts?
MR. MYERS: Your Honor, in this case, we made a

21

choice to concentrate or focus on the issue of the - of

22

the sufficiency of the - of the identification of the

23

claim as Federal, and we maintained that as the focus and

24

that was the - the focus of the petition, of course, for -

25

QUESTION: And you want us to decide this case on

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the assumption that facts were presented when indeed none

2

were?

3

MR. MYERS: In this case, yes, Your Honor,

4

inasmuch as we have not appealed from - we have not made

5

that an issue below and appealed from it.

6

for review solely confined to the issue of the adequate -

7

the adequacy of the - of the sufficiency of the - of the

8

identification of the claim as Federal in nature.

9

could -

10
11
12

We have asked

If I

QUESTION: May I - may I go back to the question
QUESTION: Just to make it clear where - where

13

your - what your rule is, the very asset Justice O'Connor

14

said, does it suffice if you cite a constitutional

15

provision, a case, a - a formulation.

16

another discussion, but that was only part of your test,

17

because you also, I take it, assert that you - that the

18

petitioner must set forth the factual basis for its claim

19

- for his claim?

And then we had

20

MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.

21

QUESTION: So that that's a two-part test.

It -

22

and it seems to me that in some cases it's going to be

23

fairly obvious what the facts are and in some cases it's

24

fairly obvious what the legal standard is, and depending.

25

In the case that Justice Stevens puts, where he alleges

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

just the facts that his - that his lawyer was not even a

2

lawyer and - and indicates why it was ineffective, but -

3

but doesn't cite a Federal provision, it seems to me any

4

judge knows you have to have adequate assistance of

5

counsel under the Sixth Amendment, and that in the case

6

put by Justice Stevens, it is simply a formalistic

7

requirement.

8
9

Now, it may be that you're going to say,
although it's formalistic in some cases, it's necessary to

10

run the habeas system that we have this rule.

11

is the latter your position?

12

Is - is -

MR. MYERS: It - well, Your Honor, we don't -

13

yes.

14

claim so described could equally describe a violation of,

15

conceivably, I suppose, state statute, but certainly a

16

state constitution.

17

the whole notion of - of - of Federalism or comity, as

18

applied in habeas, that this Court enforce the reality

19

that we have state constitutions that are offering

20

protections -

21

We don't believe that it's formalistic inasmuch as a

And I think it's at the very heart of

QUESTION: We certainly enforce it with respect

22

to people raising claims in our Court.

23

specifically that they refer to a specific source of

24

Federal law before we will even decide it.

25

MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.

We require very

QUESTION: How does the case decided, the

2

Fitzgerald case, which is cited in page 34 of the red

3

brief, it was just last term, when - when this Court said

4

that the Court would consider a state court decision as

5

relying on Federal grounds sufficient to support this

6

Court's jurisdiction, if under the state's decisional law,

7

the state and the Federal constitutional claim are treated

identically, the content of the right is treated

identically.

10

That - that decision from just last term says,

11

you've got a claim out there and it's a constitutional

12

claim and the Federal law and state law are identical, the

13

content of the law is identical, we will treat it as

14

Federal.

That was a decision just from last term.

15

MR. MYERS: I - I may have misunderstood the -

16

that interpretation, Your Honor, because I thought this

17

was still a very much open question as to whether -

18

QUESTION: This was not in the habeas context.

19

MR. MYERS: Yes, I understand.

20
21

And in the habeas

context QUESTION: And it - what I read to you is - is

22

from the decision itself.

The Court will consider a state

23

court decision as relying upon Federal grounds sufficient

24

to support the Court's jurisdiction.

25

state courts have in other cases declared that they will

That is, when the

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

apply the same analysis in considering the state

2

constitutional claim as the Federal courts would, I think

3

in that case it was equal protection.

4

- that was critical to the Court's deciding that case last

5

term.

6

But the - the Court

MR. MYERS: Well, if I am understanding it

7

correctly, Your Honor, I would very much advocate for the

8

Court not extending - I'm understanding it correctly - not

9

extending that - that doctrine or view, if you will, into

10
11

the habeas context.
QUESTION: It had to do with jurisdiction, not

12

with pleading.

13

Federal law.

14

the Court was claiming a violation of Federal law.

15

the case held was that there is jurisdiction because the -

16

we will assume that the state court made a ruling on a

17

question of Federal law where it relies on state law that

18

looks to Federal cases.

19

pleading question that you have before you.

20
21
22

There was pled in the case a violation of
There was no doubt that the person before
What

That's quite different from the

QUESTION: May I ask you what you understand to
be the purpose of the exhaustion requirement?
MR. MYERS: It is, Your Honor, to assure that the

23

states have a meaningful first response - opportunity to

24

consider Federal attacks on their convictions, and to -

25

QUESTION: Do you - do you think the hypothetical
19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that I gave you would give a state court a meaningful

2

opportunity to decide the Federal question?

3

MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION: Then it would seem we would follow the

5

exhaustion requirement is satisfied.

6

MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION: May I go back to the question of

8

appointment of counsel?

Is counsel routinely appointed

9

for state petitioners in the state courts of Oregon -

10

MR. MYERS: Yes, Your Honor, by statute -

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. MYERS: In the post-conviction relief

13

- for state habeas -

process, yes.

14

QUESTION: Okay.

15

MR. MYERS: Always, by statute.

There is one

16

further reason also I'd like to mention to the Court for

17

not adopting a view that generally says, if a state

18

court's interpretation of a particular assertion of - of a

19

- of a right, and the Federal interpretation are the same,

20

therefore the Federal claim has been presented

21

automatically.

22

very transitory rule for the Court to adopt inasmuch as

23

the state interpretation of its own law could change at a

24

given point in time, and thus, in a given jurisdiction,

25

what was congruent ceases to be congruent.

And that is that I think that represents a

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

This Court's interpretation of Federal law could

2

change so that, again, where there might have been

3

congruencies before, they - they have now become

4

incongruent, and -

5

QUESTION: Don't you think it's likely that

6

Federal judges sitting in the state would be aware of

7

those changes?

8
9

MR. MYERS: Yes, I think they would be aware of
them, Your Honor.

But also to come back to a point that

10

Justice Scalia made, it - there could be also renewed and

11

further issues as to whether there has been a change,

12

whether they are congruent or not congruent -

13

QUESTION: But are you thinking of changes that

14

are favorable to the claimant or favorable to the state?

15
16
17

MR. MYERS: Well, I think it could go either way,
Your Honor.
QUESTION: But certainly if it's favorable to the

18

claimant, it couldn't cause any harm.

It's only if you

19

make it narrower that it would make a difference.

20

MR. MYERS: Yes.

21

QUESTION: I guess in every case where the

22

Federal habeas court has some doubt whether a Federal

23

claim was raised, the Federal habeas court, that is, where

24

it is not explicitly stated, the Federal habeas court will

25

have to inquire into state law to see whether it is indeed
21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

congruent with Federal law.

Isn't that right?

MR. MYERS: Yes, that's correct.

Any event, with

3

the present state of the law within the circuits, and in

4

light of the Ninth Circuit's decision, Your Honors, we

5

very much hope that this Court will take the opportunity

6

in this case to both reaffirm that it is the petitioner's

7

responsibility to set forth, to choose and to set forth

8

his Federal claim as Federal, and that you will provide

9

further guidance as to how that must occur.

That furthers

10

clarification can certainly work to serve all the

11

interests that are at stake here, a true meaningful

12

opportunity for the states to be able to - to have the

13

first opportunity to decide the Federal questions.

14

It can reduce the amount of litigation that is

15

occurring around the exhaustion issue, and, I think - and

16

- and save precious resources, and I think, Your Honors,

17

that a clear, further - a further clarification of the

18

rule will actually serve the interests of petitioners by

19

make - bringing meritorious Federal claims to - to

20

decision more - sooner and more consistently.

21

QUESTION: What was wrong with the Ninth

22

Circuit's position, at least with respect to the

23

intermediate appellate court?

24

decision of a court below.

25

written all over it.

That is, it's reviewing a

That court below has Federal

Why isn't that a - a reasonable
22

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

assumption that the - that the intermediate appellate

2

court where there is jurisdiction as a matter of right,

3

it's reviewing a decision, it's bound to read that

4

decision?

5

MR. MYERS: Actually, Your Honor, in the petition

6

for review in Oregon, the decision of the court below is

7

included, but that in this case was a summary affirmance

8

of the - of the trial court's decision.

9

QUESTION: Well, you're talking about the court -

10

the Supreme Court of Oregon.

I think Justice Ginsburg was

11

asking about the Oregon Court of Appeals.

12

MR. MYERS: Yes, that's -

13

QUESTION: The - the appeal from the trial court

14
15

to the court of appeals.
MR. MYERS: I beg your pardon, Your Honor.

Well,

16

insofar as that stage is concerned, the - the - the papers

17

that were submitted to the court of appeals did not advise

18

or tell that court that a Federal question was being

19

raised, a Federal claim was being raised.

20

simply a claim of inadequate assistance of appellate

21

counsel, but there was no indication that - whether that

22

was a state claim, state law-based claim or a Federal law-

23

based claim.

24
25

There was

And both state and Federal law-based claims of
inadequate assistance of appellate counsel had been - had

stage.

4

QUESTION: Do you wish to reserve the rest of
your time, General Myers?

5

MR. MYERS: I do.

6

QUESTION: Very well.

Mr. Balske, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DENNIS BALSKE

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11

Thank you.

MR. BALSKE: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:

12

We have a narrow question of fair presentation

13

here, and it isn't a great effort for the courts, I don't

14

believe, in Mr. Reese's case, to go searching to find that

15

he did fairly present.

16

petition itself, which alleges the violation both under

17

the state and Federal Constitution.

18

and Fourteenth Amendments.

19
20

We start out by going to the PCR

It mentions the Sixth

And then, when the -

QUESTION: You're talking about the trial court,
correct?

21

MR. BALSKE: Yes, I am.

22

QUESTION: You have to - you agree you have to

23
24
25

And when -

present the claim all the way up through the state?
MR. BALSKE: I do, I do.

And when the trial

court decides it, we go right into the Oregon clear
24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statement rule.

2

the appellate courts know the basis of those trial court

3

rulings, so we have the clear statement rule under

4

138.640.

5
6

Oregon post-conviction is designed to let

QUESTION: Well, there were - there were two there was a petition and an amended position, as I recall.

7

MR. BALSKE: Correct.

8

QUESTION: Correct me if I'm wrong.

9

MR. BALSKE: You're right.

10

QUESTION: And the - the original petition did

11

not recite the - the factual basis to support the claim.

12

That was only in the amended petition, and the amended

13

petition was not - the amended petition, I - I take it,

14

please correct me if I'm wrong, was - was the one in which

15

the allegation of conflict of interest and the precise

16

reasons for it was cited.

17

case because then it's not - that amended petition, which

18

contained the factual basis, is - is not incorporated or

19

cited to the court of - the state court of appeals.

20

That seems to drop out of the

MR. BALSKE: Well, well the - the way it works in

21

PCR is the court, under the pleadings, decides the case

22

based on the first amended petition.

23

states the legal basis of the claim under the Federal and

24

state Constitution.

25

the state trial court made and - and relied on.

That's the one that

That's the one that the judgment of

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

So under the clear statement rule, then, when it

2

made its decision and cited a Federal ground, under

3

Oregon's clear statement rule, we have a decision on

4

Federal grounds at that -

5
6

QUESTION: No, you're - you're - you refer to a
clear statement rule.

Is that a rule of Oregon law -

7

MR. BALSKE: Yes.

8

QUESTION: - or a rule of Federal law?

9

MR. BALSKE: That is a rule of Oregon law, and

10

that -

11
12

QUESTION: And what does - what does it - what
does that - what's the case for it, and what does it say?

13
14

MR. BALSKE: It's not a case, it's a
statute.

15

QUESTION: Okay.

16

MR. BALSKE: It's 138.640.

It's at the state's

17

brief in the appendix at page 4, and it reads as follows,

18

quote, the order making final disposition of the petition

19

shall state clearly the grounds upon which the cause was

20

determined, and whether a state or Federal question, or

21

both, was presented and decided.

22

And in Mr. Reese's case, the trial court

23

followed that rule and filed a memorandum of opinion that

24

cited that its decision of the ineffectiveness claim was

25

on Federal grounds only.

And then Mr. - then Mr. Reese
26

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

appeals.
QUESTION: Did - did - did the order of the

3

Oregon trial court specify the facts upon which the

4

Federal claim was -

5

MR. BALSKE: No.

6

QUESTION: - was based?

7

MR. BALSKE: No.

But again, that's not before

8

the Court in the issue presented, and that issue was

9

waived by the state in the Ninth Circuit.

They abandoned

10

any position that Mr. Reese's claim wasn't sufficiently

11

factually based, and we're presented with the question of

12

fair presentation, whether or not he indicated -

13
14

QUESTION: Well, all right, but it wasn't, okay?
I mean, I'm in an appeals court, I've a lot to do -

15

MR. BALSKE: Right.

16

QUESTION: - thousands of cases.

17

judgments of all sorts below.

18

when I have thousands of cases.

19

this individual complaining about?

There are

I don't read the judgments
I look and see, what is

20

MR. BALSKE: Right.

21

QUESTION: So I look to see what the arguments

22

are that he's making that the lower court made a mistake.

23

Now, if I was in the Supreme Court of Oregon, and I

24

thought, but I lost this, that you shouldn't have to

25

present it in the Supreme Court of Oregon, but the rule is
27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

you do.

2

MR. BALSKE: Right.

3

QUESTION: All right?

Well, I'm there as a busy

4

judge, I look at it, he makes no mention of the Federal

5

claim, goodbye, that's the end of it.

6

the Federal claim.

7

hold to the contrary?

8
9

I don't look up at

So - what - what - why - how could we

MR. BALSKE: There - let - let me help you there.
If you will turn to the - page 44 of the joint appendix,

10

what you're going to find there is the petition for review

11

to the Oregon Supreme Court.

12

and 44 and 45 across, what you see is it follows the

13

standard form, it's in proper form, nothing more.

14

And when you get to page 44,

But when you turn the page, as a busy judge

15

you're scanning, as you're talking about, and you look and

16

you say, what's it about, is this a state case or a

17

Federal case, look on the first page, 46, index of

18

authorities, constitutions.

19

Constitution, four constitutional amendments cited, Fifth,

20

Sixth, Eight, Fourteenth -

21

Only one, the Federal

QUESTION: But all that tells me is that

22

somewhere in this brief they're cited, that's the table of

23

authorities they cite.

That isn't what the argument is.

24

MR. BALSKE: And - well -

25

QUESTION: So if I'm going to look to see what
28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the argument is, I'll try to turn the page and -

2

MR. BALSKE: A judge -

3

QUESTION: - where does it say he's making the

4

argument -

5

MR. BALSKE: You're not going to look for an

6

argument because you're an Oregon Supreme Court judge, and

7

under the Oregon Supreme Court rule, I'm - yeah,

8

9.05(4)(A)(v), the petitioner only presents a brief

9

argument if he wants to, it's optional.

10

argument into a petition for a review, so -

11
12

You don't put

QUESTION: Do you have to have your reasons why
they're wrong and so on?

13

MR. BALSKE: Yes, and in -

14

QUESTION: Where is that?

15

MR. BALSKE: - that's where we turn to the next

16

page, 47, statement of legal questions presented on

17

review.

18

Constitution, ineffectiveness - ineffective assistance of

19

both trial court and appellate court counsel.

20

paragraph, statement of reasons for reversal of court of

21

appeals.

22

trial court and appellate court counsel.

We - we see on the page across from the Federal

The next

Again we see ineffective assistance of both

23

So, it - we're scanning it, we're busy, we're

24

just trying to decide whether we're going to review the

25

case.

We're not deciding it on the merits.

We've got a

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Federal case.

2

by Mr. Reese.

We've got a Federal issue.

It's presented

3

QUESTION: I see.

4

QUESTION: I - I couldn't possibly tell from this

5

what - what the case was about, other than some free-

6

floating ineffective assistance of counsel case.

7

MR. BALSKE: And that -

8

QUESTION: And - and are you saying that Oregon

9
10

rules make it optional as to whether he's going to tell me
what the case is about?

11

MR. BALSKE: Yeah, what - well, whether you're

12

going to brief it, whether you're going to present legal

13

argument.

14

It's optional under QUESTION: But there are no facts.

I mean, if

15

you're in the Federal habeas court, why aren't you just

16

out right there for having no facts?

17
18

MR. BALSKE: Because the state waived that
defense in this case.

I'm - I - that's just the way -

19

QUESTION: But it - but the point is -

20

MR. BALSKE: I'm sorry.

21

QUESTION: - as I understand my colleague's

22

question, if the judge sees that there are no facts set

23

out, why doesn't the judge just say, you're out of here?

24
25

MR. BALSKE: The judge might say that, but the
judge would say that in the context of a Federal question,
30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a Federal issue presented of ineffective assistance of

2

counsel under the Federal Constitution.

3
4

QUESTION: But think he would say that on the
basis of Oregon procedural law that -

5

MR. BALSKE: Well -

6

QUESTION:

7
8
9

- you - you just haven't said

anything.
MR. BALSKE: Well, I don't - well, it's
conjecture what they would have decided or thought.

10

What's critical here is what was presented, the question

11

today is what was presented versus -

12
13

QUESTION: Okay.

What - what - what is the

hardship for a - for a petitioner in PCR Oregon -

14

MR. BALSKE: Sure.

15

QUESTION: - to either say, I'm relying on

16

section, you know, article XIV of the United States

17

Constitution, or I'm relying on some Federal case.

18

mean, that - that just seems a very minimal requirement.

I

19

MR. BALSKE: Well -

20

QUESTION: What's - what's hard about that?

21

MR. BALSKE: Well -

22

QUESTION: Could - can you answer that?

23

MR. BALSKE: I - I can answer it by saying that

24

the prisoners are pretty ignorant.

Their lawyers in the

25

state post-conviction system, bless their souls, are not

the sharpest lawyers in the world.
QUESTION: Well, you - how sharp do you have to
be to figure that out?
MR. BALSKE: Well, tell you what, let me give you

5

the perfect example in this case.

6

state's brief for its application of the rule.

7

sharp you have to be.

8

of the brief, we see that five lawyers, including the

attorney general of Oregon have -

Here's how

Now, I think if you read the cover

QUESTION: No, where - are - are you reading from
some - in the brief?
MR. BALSKE: Yes.

I'm sorry.

Please look at the

13

top and then look at number IIA and read their language,

14

alert the state court to the Federal legal source of the

15

claim by, A, citing to the Sixth Amendment, quote, my

16

appellate attorney violated my right to effective

17

assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment.

18

sorry, you didn't pick that up.

I'm

It's page 42 -

19

QUESTION: Go ahead.

20

MR. BALSKE: If Mr. Reese followed the formula

21

written by the attorney general, he would fail their test,

22

because the right to ineffective assistance of appellate

23

counsel comes under the Fourteenth Amendment, not the

24

Sixth Amendment.

25

are writing the test for you, can't even get it right.

But the state's attorney generals, who

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

How is a poor indigent prisoner going to know how to say

2

the right number?

I mean -

3

QUESTION: Touche.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. BALSKE: I - I think, Justice O'Connor -

6

QUESTION: I - I think it's - it's - it's common

7

to, you know, you've heard of the incorporation doctrine,

8

which is that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates and

9

applies to the states the first ten amendments, or at

10

least portions of the first ten amendments.

11

MR. BALSKE: But -

12

QUESTION: So it is not inaccurate to say that -

13

that it's a Sixth Amendment right, which has been applied

14

to the states via the Fourteenth.

15

MR. BALSKE: I thought when we're talking about

16

appellate counsel, though, the Sixth Amendment doesn't

17

cover it, because the Sixth Amendment doesn't give you the

18

right to effective counsel on your appeal, only at trial.

19

And the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection and due

20

process are what actually cover them.

21

claiming ineffective assistance of appellate, not trial,

22

appellate counsel, it is Fourteenth Amendment, it's not

23

Sixth Amendment.

24
25

So, if - if you're

QUESTION: What would happen if the Oregon
constitution happened to contain the right in the same

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

number amendment, like the Sixth was - they were both

2

Sixth Amendment.

3

the Federal Constitution?

4
5
6

Then you have to say Sixth Amendment of

MR. BALSKE: Well, the - it - the trouble here,
the heart QUESTION: Or is this - is this one of the ones

7

that it doesn't contain it in the Oregon constitution

8

Sixth Amendment so this is one of the ones that, by

9

necessity, must refer to.

10

MR. BALSKE: No.

This isn't one of those,

11

because that's at article I, section 11, it doesn't.

12

this isn't the easy case, this is a -

So

13

QUESTION: But the - the court of appeals -

14

MR. BALSKE:

15

QUESTION: - thought that the only way in which

- tougher case.

16

trial court.

MR. BALSKE: I think they said that, and I don't

I only defend the judgment.

MR. BALSKE: I only say to you he fairly
presented the claim in this case.

12
13

QUESTION: Right.

In - in your opinion, as a

lawyer who, I take it, is involved in these things -

14

MR. BALSKE: Yes.

15

QUESTION: - is there really a big problem of

16

differences among the lower circuits - among the lower

17

courts?

18

it the rule now is called fair presentation?

To what extent do we have to find a rule?

I take

19

MR. BALSKE: Correct.

20

QUESTION: And there are dozens of ways it could

21

be done.

And so the court is just like - supposed to look

22

at the individual circumstance, say was it done, was it

applying this fair presentation test?

Now, is there a

MR. BALSKE: Well, I -

MR. BALSKE: - I don't think they are in the

Otherwise, it was not going to make it.

And - and I just have to - I can't speak for my

QUESTION: - but the - the petition that you read

11

me at the appendix, where that just cites the Federal

12

constitutional provision and then says ineffective of

counsel - ineffective assistance of counsel - does not

give the court any clue as to what it's supposed to do -

MR. BALSKE: Well -

QUESTION: - other than to review a record.

17

MR. BALSKE: Well - sorry.

18

exhaustion requirement was designed to give the court some

assistance in determining whether or not it showed -

should spend more time with the case in order to review

And it just - by the - by the state appellate

2

court - and it just didn't have that information.

3

MR. BALSKE: Well, what the purpose of the

4

exhaustion rule is to give him a fair opportunity to

5

decide it.

6

review, it's a little different because it's not your

7

brief on the merits where they're actually deciding -

And when you're talking about petitions for

That gives us very, very little

12

MR. BALSKE: Well -

13

QUESTION: Sixth Amendment.

14

MR. BALSKE: - here - here we're talking about

15

ineffective assistance of counsel.

16

with an Oregon statute that required the Oregon court to

17

even tell the appellate courts whether it had been decided

18

under the state or the Federal Constitution.

19

they said this was decided under Federal.

20

he uses ineffective, I know that that's less than

21

satisfying, but in Oregon too, if you look in the state's

22

brief, I think, at page 4, footnote 5, what you're going

23

to find there is Oregon's - the State of Oregon's position

24

on what a inmate means when he says ineffectiveness.

25

We're talking about it

And here

And then when

There it says that in applying article I,
38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

section 11 of the Oregon constitution, quote, Oregon

2

courts often refer to inadequate assistance of counsel

3

instead of ineffective assistance of counsel, the term

4

usually employed by the state and Federal courts in

5

applying the analogous provision of the Federal

6

Constitution.

7

So as the Oregon courts are reading the

8

pleadings, the definition we're looking at, ineffective

9

assistance of counsel, the term usually employed by the

10

state and Federal courts.

11

aside, which aren't with this case at this point, legal

12

only, the Oregon courts were fairly presented with the

13

Federal question because -

14

We're giving, factual parts

QUESTION: Well, it seems to me that argument

15

that you're making now that inadequate is the buzzword for

16

a state claim, ineffective for a Federal claim, is at

17

least in tension with your argument that - that in - with

18

respect to ineffective assistance of counsel, the state -

19

the content of the state standard and - is identical to

20

the Federal.

21

content is identical, so how -

22

So these labels don't mean anything if the

MR. BALSKE: Right.

Well, I - all I'm, I guess I

23

inartfully stated it.

I - the position I wanted to

24

convey, and I didn't, is that we started out with a clear

25

Federal claim, and when he used ineffective twice more in
39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

his appeals, he did nothing at all to dispel anybody of

2

the fact that it was a Federal case.

3

Federal and he had allegations under state and Federal

4

Constitution.

5

ineffectiveness.

6

narrowing the case at all.

It started out

It got decided Federal and then he said
He gave no indication that he was

7

And a good contrast is another Ninth Circuit en

8

banc case, Peterson, because Peterson raised it just like

9

Mr. Reese initially, under both constitutions.

He raised

10

it again that way in the appellate court.

11

to his petition for review, he indicated that, to the

12

Oregon Supreme Court, that he was going on the state

13

constitution, because he only said in his petition for

14

review that this violated article I, section 11 of the

15

Oregon constitution.

16

But when he got

That's a contrast, and much - and he, as the

17

Ninth Circuit held, did not exhaust his state remedies,

18

because he didn't give the Oregon Supreme Court the fair

19

opportunity, because what he did was he took their eyes

20

and led them over to the state constitution.

21

Reese didn't do that.

22

And Mr.

QUESTION: Well, if you - you say that the Ninth

23

Circuit approach to this was wrong, which - which seems to

24

be anchored in, if it's clear that the court of first

25

instance relied on the Federal ground, that stays with the
40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

case all the way up.

2

you - you are asking us to affirm the judgment, not that

3

reasoning.

4

You - you reject that, or you say,

What is your reasoning?
MR. BALSKE: Sure.

What is enough?

My reasoning is that it's

5

fairly presented when a state inmate clearly articulates

6

it under the Federal Constitution, and then continues to

7

appeal that judgment without indicating in any way

8

whatsoever that he's relying on anything but the Federal

9

Constitution.

10

QUESTION: But may I -

11

QUESTION: Then I don't see how that differs from

12

the Ninth Circuit -

13

QUESTION: That's the Ninth Circuit.

14

QUESTION: - because you have to start with the

15

court of first instance, and you seem to be saying that

16

the court of first instance relies on a Federal ground

17

that stays with the case.

18
19

MR. BALSKE: That - I - that's true.
with that portion of it.

I agree

I guess maybe I -

20

QUESTION: I thought you said before that you

21

were not defending the - the Ninth Circuit's approach.

22

MR. BALSKE: I -

23

QUESTION: Now you tell me you are.

I thought

24

you were relying upon the statement in the - in the brief

25

to the supreme court that he was relying upon - upon the
41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Federal Constitution.

2

MR. BALSKE: That's correct.

3

QUESTION: And I was going to ask you if you're

4

relying on that now, why didn't you rely on it in your

5

brief in opposition?

6

was, does a state prisoner alert the state's highest court

7

that he is raising a Federal claim when, in that court, he

8

neither cites a specific provision of the Federal

9

Constitution nor cites at least one authority that has

10

The question presented by the state

decided the claim on a Federal basis?

Why - why didn't -

11

MR. BALSKE: I did -

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. BALSKE: I did, but I -

14

QUESTION: - by simply saying the question is not

- you respond to that -

15

presented because, in fact, he did cite a specific

16

provision of the Constitution?

17

MR. BALSKE: I did, but I didn't -

18

QUESTION: I mean, we're wasting our time here if

19

- if you want us to decide whether this brief -

20

MR. BALSKE: It's -

21

QUESTION: - you know, contains the - the Sixth

22

Amendment or not.

The question we granted cert on is,

23

does he alert it when he neither - neither cites a

24

specific provision of the Federal Constitution nor cites

25

at least one authority?

I - I mean 42

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

MR. BALSKE: I understand.

2

QUESTION: What - we're just spinning our wheels

3

here.

4
5

QUESTION: You - you said you did raise that in
the EIO?

6

MR. BALSKE: But, yeah -

7

QUESTION: Where?

8

MR. BALSKE: - it's argued in -

9

QUESTION: I need to go back to it.

10

MR. BALSKE: It's in section III of my brief.

11

QUESTION: I've just looked at it.

12

I - I didn't

see it.

13

MR. BALSKE: Okay.

14

QUESTION: I didn't see it presented very

15
16

clearly.

It seems to me QUESTION: All right.

Anyway, what you're asking

17

is - that's why I started at the beginning.

I thought the

18

question was - I thought what the Ninth Circuit did was

19

cite a case called Lyons, and in Lyons they say you do

20

have to either cite a particular provision of the Federal

21

Constitution or a case that's clearly a Federal case.

22

then they held that the brief you pointed out to me did

23

not do that.

24

good enough because in the lower courts or other courts

25

they had cited the Federal Constitution explicitly.

Then they said, but anyway, that brief is

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

And

1

Now on that question, I would think they're

2

wrong, aren't they?

Because, as I started out, you can't

3

expect judges to start going back and filing - looking

4

through all the briefs they filed in the lower courts, or

5

the opinions below.

6

MR. BALSKE: Well, I -

7

QUESTION: That was, I thought, the question.

8

MR. BALSKE: Well -

9

QUESTION: And on that question, do you - what do

10

you want to say?

11

I mean, if you're -

MR. BALSKE: Well, I guess what I want to say is

12

this.

13

necessarily espousing a rule, I'm trying to say that my

14

client, Mr. Reese, fairly presented.

15

Mr. Reese fairly presented, I don't think that our

16

approach is going to place a great burden on the courts by

17

any stretch, because all you have to look at is his

18

pleading in the state court that started it, where he says

19

Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment.

20

brief in the court of appeals and his petition for review,

21

and the answer is there.

22

I think - if the rule that I'm - I'm not

But in saying that

Then you just look at his

And -

QUESTION: So - so - so now you're - you're -

23

what you - in order to win your case, you're going to have

24

to give us a standard, and your standard is, it seems to

25

me, that state appellate courts are bound to look at the
44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

2

MR. BALSKE: I guess you're seeing my focus being

3

back in the state courts, and I'm looking at Federal

4

court.

5

petition and the state steps forward and says failure to

6

exhaust.

7

coming forward and saying, take a look at what was in the

8

briefs and what was presented, not what was in the minds

9

of the state courts when they looked at them -

I'm looking at when the petitioner files his

Petitioner's counsel then has the burden of

10

QUESTION: No, but the exhaustion rule -

11

MR. BALSKE: - but what did he present?

12

QUESTION: - depends upon whether or not the

13

state appellate courts had fair notice of the claim.

14

MR. BALSKE: Yes.

15

QUESTION: And that's - that's what we're trying

16

to discuss here and -

17

QUESTION: That sounds -

18

QUESTION: - and it - and - and the - and the

19

only way you can save your case, in the posture that comes

20

to us, as I see it, is that that state appellate court is

21

bound to look at the pleadings in the - in the court of

22

first instance.

23

MR. BALSKE: Well, what we have here -

24

QUESTION: And - and that is a rule.

25

MR. BALSKE: Well - well, here's -

your judgment, we're going to have to do it with a rule.

3

MR. BALSKE: Well, and I think with the rule,

4

here's - here's the caveat to the rule, so to speak, and

5

it's that comity goes both ways.

6

respecting the state courts have given him the

7

opportunity, but we're also going to respect the state's

looking at petitions and appeals.

And here we're looking

10

at Oregon.

11

Oregon, we have the statute that I read early - earlier,

12

the plain statement, clear statement rule.

13
14

So -

QUESTION: But that just goes to the trial
court's judgment, doesn't it?

don't need the Ninth Circuit rule when we get to the

MR. BALSKE: I mean, I know that -

QUESTION: I mean, what's bothering me about it

5

is it sounds like a reasonable position, but it also

sounds like a position I agreed with in dissent, which

means it isn't the law, the opposite is the law.

MR. BALSKE: Well, at - I don't disagree that

13

preserved in the Ninth Circuit that whatever else, this

14

doesn't tell us what the facts were, would not that have

been a - a ground for saying you didn't exhaust?

16

MR. BALSKE: That would have been a bigger

17

problem for me than this problem, yes, because although he

18

said, and part of his saying was under the Oregon Balfour

19

procedure when he didn't have a lawyer, he said, my lawyer

20

and I disagreed on what issues to raise.

21

Mr. Reese didn't say factually was what those issues were,

and that would be my problem if their position were that

factually it wasn't clear enough.

MR. BALSKE: Yes, I - that's true.

They did

4

QUESTION: Do we have to ignore that too?

5

MR. BALSKE: I think you should, and I've argued

6

in my brief that you should because they dropped it from

7

the case and abandoned it, and because the only issue

8

presented is the issue of whether or not he fairly

presented it.

So I would espouse that, whether you have

to or not, obviously your decision.

QUESTION: But if this - if this Court is going

to give any guidance, certainly that should be the - the

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEN. HARDY MYERS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. MYERS: Your Honor, so two quick comments or

4

points.

First, this case illustrates the fallacy of any

5

kind of doctrine which says that a appellate court can

6

tell what issues have been chosen to be asserted to it,

7

put before it, by going back and looking at the decision

8

of a - of a lower court.

9

disposed of one of the Federal inappellate assistance of

Here, the trial court in Oregon

10

counsel claims, citing Jones against Barnes, but it had

11

before it state law claims of inappellate - ineffective

12

assistance of counsel, as well as Federal.

13

court didn't mention the state claims, but they were all

14

dismissed as well by the judgment that was ultimately

15

entered at the trial court level.

16

The trial

So both state and Federal claims were dismissed.

17

You couldn't tell by looking at the trial court judgment

18

what the - what the prisoner was choosing to actually

19

assert among those dismissed claims at the court of

20

appeals level.

21

dismissed state ineffective assistance of counsel claim.

22

He could as well have been asserting his

QUESTION: General Myers, do you have any

23

response to the - to the new point raised - it was new to

24

me anyway - that - that this in fact, the Federal claim

25

was raised in the petition?

1

MR. MYERS: No.

2

QUESTION: What - what is that?

3

I'd really like

to know that.

4
5

Yes, I do, Your Honor.

MR. MYERS: It - at page 47-48 of the joint
appendix, which you may have already been referring to -

6

QUESTION: Yes.

7

MR. MYERS: - the petition for review is set

8

forth.

9

which is at the very - second paragraph of the argument

10

And if you go to the argument portion, Your Honor,

portion, I think that's going to be on page 48.

11

QUESTION: Yes.

12

MR. MYERS: You'll see the last - second sentence

13

of the second paragraph: Moreover, since petitioner

14

asserts he was coerced and threatened by counsel to waive

15

his right to trial by jury, petitioner believes his Fifth,

16

Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights have been -

17

QUESTION: I see, I see.

18

MR. MYERS: - have been violated.

So - so the

19

ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim was

20

specifically Federalized, if you will, and that's the -

21

that's the only place where those Federal citations

22

appear.

23

QUESTION: Okay.

24

MR. MYERS: Your Honors, again, the - the state

25

of the law in this area, we think, can fairly be described

1

as still disturbed, a term I used earlier, and we very

2

sincerely hope that this Court will use this case both in

3

relation to the Ninth Circuit decision to reaffirm that it

4

is the state petitioner, not the state courts, who have

5

the responsibility to assert - fairly present the claim,

6

and secondly, to go for further - and further clarify

7

specifically what state prisoners must do in order to

8

clearly indicate the Federal source of their claim -

9

QUESTION: If you prevail, I hope you're not

10

unhappy with what you get, because you're going to have

11

petitions in which there's a huge laundry list of cases.

12

We have to then qualify that by saying there has to be a

13

fair and concise statement of the legal and the factual

14

basis for the claim.

15

MR. MYERS: Your Honor, indeed, the fact that

16

Federal - or that the Federal source of the claim is used

17

is not the end of the fair presentation issue, because

18

there's still going to be the ongoing requirement of

19

adequately identifying your substance of your claim, to

20

use the terminology of this Court, the - the legal theory

21

as well as the adequacy of the fact.

Myers.
