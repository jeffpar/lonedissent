ORAL ARGUMENT OF SETH P. WAXMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Unlike the two cases in which you heard

12

argument yesterday, and unlike Oregon v. Elstad, the

13

original inculpatory statement in this case was

14

elicited not merely in violation of a prophylactic

15

rule, but of the Constitution itself, specifically

16

the Sixth Amendment right of an accused to the

17

assistance of counsel throughout his criminal

18

prosecution, a right designed to protect equality in

19

the adversarial process by a --

20

QUESTION:

What is your authority, Mr.

21

Waxman, for saying that this is different from the

22

Miranda warnings in the sense that it's -- it's an

23

immediate violation rather than something --

24

something like Miranda?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, it's -- Your Honor, I
3

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

guess I have a two-fold answer.

First of all, the --

2

the constitutional right involved is the Sixth

3

Amendment right, unlike in Miranda, the Fifth

4

Amendment right of self-incrimination.

5

Oregon v. Elstad and Chavez v. Martinez, this Court

6

recognized that although the Fifth Amendment

7

self-incrimination right is not completed until the

8

statement or its fruits are introduced at trial, the

9

primary illegality, as this Court has used the

And in -- in

10

phrase, is the coercion of the confession, and the

11

Elstad rule doesn't apply where the primary

12

illegality is constitutionally-proscribed conduct.

13

And here, this Court has not formally

14

decided whether the Sixth Amendment is violated at

15

the time the uncounseled, post-indictment statement

16

is deliberately elicited, or only when the statement

17

or fruits are admitted, that briefs of both sides

18

rehearse for the Court somewhat conflicting

19

statements in different opinions.

20

We rely on the cases cited in footnote 5

21

on page 8 of our reply brief, but for purposes of

22

this case, Your Honor, it doesn't matter, because in

23

Elstad, this Court made clear, and reiterated in

24

Chavez, that although the Fifth Amendment violation

25

is incomplete at the time a confession is coerced,
4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

nonetheless the fruits of that confession have to be

2

suppressed under the derivative evidence rule, unless

3

the Government carries its burden to prove sufficient

4

attenuation of taint.

5

conduct deliberately eliciting from Mr. Fellers his

6

inculpatory statement at a time when the officers

7

knew he had been indicted, and the prosecution knew

8

that he had a right to the advice of counsel, the

9

fruits of that statement under Nix and Wade have to

And therefore, even if the

10

be suppressed.

11

applied in Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and

12

Sixth Amendment cases.

13

That's a rule that this Court has

QUESTION:

Do police officers generally

14

know this distinction, that when an indictment has

15

been handed down, suddenly the Sixth Amendment is in

16

the case as well as the Fifth?

17

fiction to it in that the person doesn't have a

18

lawyer yet.

19

some point to know when proceedings have commenced,

20

but I - I still think there's an element of fiction

21

in it.

22

There's an element of

As a bright line rule, I guess, we need

Well, Justice Kennedy, I

23

don't -- I don't think I would call it fiction.

I'm

Court would be as to exactly what training the police

maintained that the Sixth Amendment cuts very bright

lines.

only when, but when, the state makes the unilateral

determination to change its formal relationship with

an individual from one in which the individual may or

may not be under investigation, but the --

But this Court has long established, long

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, you -- you're

making a -- a very technical distinction, if I

10

understand you correctly.

11

in the case of no indictment yet, who has been

12

arrested, and the person who has been indicted and

13

then arrested, and they're both alone with the same

14

police officers in the same jail cell, and they're

15

both subjected to the same interrogation.

16

the derivative evidence rule apply to the one or not

17

the other?

18

rights, it seems to me that these two individuals are

19

similarly situated.

20

If we focus on the suspect

Why should

If we're talking about constitutional

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, they -- they aren't,

21

Your Honor, and I don't think this is a matter of

22

technicality or formality.

23

formalism, but the two different amendments -- the

24

Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,

25

and the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of

2

different things.

and the second protects the right of someone as to

4

whom the Government has formally set its face and

5

invoked a formal adversarial process.

6

The first protects voluntariness,

The point is why -- why should

the bright line?

As in Justice Ginsburg's

10

same investigation, just the grand jury has -- hasn't

11

got around to indicting the second defendant until

12

the next day and then their rights are different.

13

MR. WAXMAN:

Your -- Your Honor, it's --

14

it is entirely true that if the Court agrees with --

15

agrees with our submission here, that the Government

16

can very easily conform its conduct simply by not

17

conducting uncounseled interrogations or elicitations

18

prior to changing its status.

19

have to examine, this Court has exhorted counsel over

20

and over again to be clear about what the underlying

21

right is protected in determining what the

22

appropriate remedy is.

23

But the -- the -- we

2

fact the hallmark of our adversary system that once

3

the Government decides to invoke a formal adversary

4

process, it proceeds on the supposition that each

5

side deals with each other, A, at arm's length, and

6

B, assisted by the advice of counsel, who will

7

prevent each side, and in particularly the defendant,

8

from, as this Court has explained in -- from

9

conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his

10

legal and constitutional rights, and that's what's

11

being protected.

12

You may call it technical, but it is in

The unindicted individual, as to whom the

13

Government may be conducting an investigation,

14

doesn't have that formal right, but once the

15

Government invokes our adversarial system, it invokes

16

a set of protections that protect, not an

individual's right to be protected from coercion or

involuntariness -- that's protected no matter when

QUESTION:

Well, how -- how far does this

right go, Mr. Waxman?

police officers can't talk to someone who has been

indicted?

MR. WAXMAN:

Oh no, of course not.

Court in Patterson v. Illinois -- I believe it was

2

Your Honor -- in any event, the Court made clear in

Patterson v. Illinois that the Sixth Amendment right

to the assistance of counsel doesn't prevent the

5

Government from eliciting statements from an indicted

defendant.

counsel or make a waiver of the right to counsel, and

8

the Court --

It requires that the accused either have

QUESTION:

Well, but it's - it's - I'm -

10

I'm talking about a situation where, say the police

11

simply say something to a -- an indicted defendant.

12

There's no violation of a right there, is there?

13

MR. WAXMAN:

There only is a violation of

14

a right, Your Honor, if what -- if the police

15

statements and conduct amount to what this Court has

16

deemed deliberate elicitation.

17

the Court has said in a half a dozen cases is that

18

the Government may not do without counsel is

19

deliberately elicit incriminating statements in the

20

absence of his lawyer.

That is, that what

happened here?
MR. WAXMAN:

certain that that's what happened here, and the -QUESTION:

magistrate and the -MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

The magistrate who

3

heard that police officers, Justice O'Connor, found

4

specifically that officers --

5
6
7

QUESTION:

He found deliberate eliciting

of the comments at the first statement?
MR. WAXMAN:

Yes.

He said it was, quote,

8

designed to elicit a response -- I'm quoting from

9

page 103 of the joint appendix --

10

QUESTION: Is that a factual finding or --

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION: -- or a legal conclusion?

It is.
I

13

mean, it seems to me he can -- he can find as a fact

14

what the officer said, but whether it constitutes

15

deliberate elicitation within the meaning of our - of

16

our opinion, it seems to me, is a legal question.

17

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, it's - I think, Your

18

Honor, Justice Scalia, it's -- this is a mixed

19

question of law and fact under Miller v. Fenton and

20

Thompson v. Keohane.

21

QUESTION:

But because -And the Eighth -- the Eighth

22

Circuit said, the Eighth Circuit is the closest court

23

to this one, and I thought that the Eighth Circuit

24

said, and that it's a threshold question in this

25

case, that it wasn't anything like interrogation, and
10

1

that that's -- wasn't that the -- the --

2

MR. WAXMAN: The Eighth --

3

QUESTION: -- prime ground of the Eighth

4

Circuit?

5

MR. WAXMAN:

Justice Ginsburg, the Eighth

6

Circuit -- two judges, the majority, the panel in the

7

Eighth Circuit, concluded that it wasn't

8

interrogation.

9
10
11

The concurring judge --

QUESTION:

But wouldn't we have to answer

that -MR. WAXMAN:

-- pointed out, Judge Riley

12

pointed out, that under the Sixth Amendment, unlike

13

the Fifth, interrogation is not the standard.

14

standard is deliberate elicitation, or, as this Court

15

has also phrased it, whether the prosecution, quote,

16

intentionally creates a situation likely to induce

17

the accused to make incriminating statements without

18

the advise of counsel.

19

QUESTION:

The

I thought the Eighth Circuit's

20

position was that all this was was the police

21

informing the defendant that he had been charged with

22

this and this crime.

23

MR. WAXMAN:

That is -- the -- the -- I

24

don't believe the Eighth Circuit made any such

25

finding, but the magistrate who heard the two
11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

officers testify and evaluated their credibility made

2

a determination, Justice Scalia, that is a mixed

3

question of fact and law.

4

Sixth Amendment, deliberate elicitation or

5

intentional creation of a situation, or purposeful

6

conduct, which are the words this Court has used,

7

involve a determination, among other things, about

8

the credibility of what the officers said.

9

The inquiry under the

And when the magistrate concluded that

10

they -- that their conduct was designed to elicit a

11

response, and that it was not made for any purpose

12

other than to get a response --

13

QUESTION:

14

Well, was - was there any

debate or controversy about what they in fact said?

15

MR. WAXMAN:

There was no debate about

16

what they said, but -- but there was a credibility

17

finding made by the magistrate, because the --

18

QUESTION:

If there was -- if there was no

19

factual dispute, why - why did -- why was credibility

20

involved?

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, when you have -- when

22

you -- because there is a subjective intent here, the

23

subjective intent of whether Officer Bliemeister, he

24

came to the house knowing that this man had been

25

indicted, and said, we are here to discuss with you
12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

your involvement with methamphetamine and your

2

involvement with four individuals.

3

QUESTION:

Well, why -- why should

4

subjective intent make any difference here?

5

the -- the effect on the -- on the accused is exactly

6

the same.

7

MR. WAXMAN:

I mean,

Your Honor, I'm -- I'm simply

8

reciting back for -- for you the court's

9

instructions, and -- and saying that if the standard

10

is deliberate elicitation and intentionally creating

11

a situation, it essentially, in terms of providing a

12

line, it proscribes what the police may not

13

deliberately do, and --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Well --- but deliberateness, I

16

think, is a finding of the magistrate, which -- to

17

which the Eighth Circuit and this Court owe

18

deference.

19

QUESTION:

But deliberateness may refer to

20

nothing more than intending the statement that was

21

made, and whether it elicits or not, or whether it

22

constitutes elicitation -- what a terrible word --

23

whether it constitutes elicitation, it seems to me,

24

can be judged objectively, can't it?

25

MR. WAXMAN:

Your Honor, perhaps, but

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

designed to elicit, it strikes me as including a

2

subjective component.

3

submit that the magistrate was correct as an a priori

4

matter in saying, look, these people -- these

5

officers -- these agents of the prosecution, came to

6

this man's house.

7

indicted, Officer Bliemeyer had been the witness --

They not only knew he had been

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WAXMAN:

10

But even if I'm wrong, I

Bliemeister, I think.
Bliemeister -- had been the

witness before the grand jury, and he comes --

11

QUESTION:

Mr. -- Mr. Waxman, I -- I will

12

assume that that is correct.

13

looks to me just as you're describing it.

14

assuming that, do you think there is any practical

15

difference between what Deputy Bliemeister did here

16

and what the officer did in Elstad?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

officer did in Elstad.

19

QUESTION:

I mean, I -- the record
But

I don't remember what the

Well, in -- in Elstad, the --

20

there were two officers, one went with the mother of

21

the suspect into the kitchen to tell her why they

22

were there.

23

another room with the -- with the boy who was the

24

suspect and started telling them what they were there

25

to -- to investigate, there was a burglary next door.

The other one -- excuse me -- stayed in

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And at the end of the conversation that's quoted in

2

the opinion he said, you know, I -- I think you may

3

know something about that, and the boy said, yes he

4

did.

5

was functionally about the same as the elicitation

6

here.

And it seems to me that the elicitation there

7

MR. WAXMAN:

8

QUESTION:

9

Well, that -But I want to know whether you

agree.

10

MR. WAXMAN:

I -- I actually don't agree.

11

I think -- I think for other reasons, that is, the --

12

the fact that this is a Sixth Amendment it doesn't

13

matter.

But I do think --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. WAXMAN:

Well --- when the police officers

16

come and say, we are here to discuss with you the

17

following things, which happened to be the precise

18

things that he has just been indicted for, that is a

19

paradigm -- paradigmatic deliberate elicitation.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WAXMAN:

22

QUESTION:

Well, yeah, but -And --- to -- to say to a kid, you

23

know, I think you may know something about this, and

24

the person making that statement's a cop, sounds like

25

elicitation to me.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. WAXMAN:

2

QUESTION:

Well, if -- if -- Mr. -Functionally -- if -- if

3

functionally it is, let's assume -- I -- I tend to

4

think it is -- and -- and functionally in each case,

5

whether it's Fifth Amendment right or Sixth Amendment

6

right, the statement doesn't come in unless there is,

7

among other things, a voluntary waiver of the right

8

to the presence of counsel then and there.

9

in each case we didn't have it.

And in --

It's hard for me to

10

see why in functional terms it should make a

11

difference whether we're talking about Sixth or Fifth

12

and why there should be a difference between this

13

case and Elstad.

14

MR. WAXMAN:

Because the functional

15

analysis depends on the right being protected.

16

Fifth Amendment right does not embed a policy against

17

deliberate elicitation of information from suspects.

18

In fact, our system embraces that.

19

a violation in Elstad, it was --

20

QUESTION:

The

And if there was

Well, neither does the Sixth.

21

The -- what the Sixth says is, before you try

22

anything like that, you've either got to have his

23

counsel present or his counsel permission or his

24

waiver of it.

25

What's the difference?

MR. WAXMAN:

It -- the difference is

what's being protected.

the Fifth is coercion.

Sixth in this instance is precisely what --

What's being protected in
What's being protected in the

Well, Mr. Waxman, isn't it also

5

true that in one case there was an indictment, in the

6

other there wasn't?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

Well, yes.

And what the

8

Sixth Amendment protects in terms, Justice Souter, is

9

that in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall

10
11

enjoy the right to the assistance of counsel.
QUESTION:

And -- and recognize he's got

12

that right because there was the indictment.

13

the Fifth Amendment case, the Miranda case, we

14

recognized that he's got that right, because this

15

Court has said that's the only way you're going to

16

make the Fifth Amendment work.

17

assumption that he's got the right, and that in fact

18

the elicitation or statements that produce his

19

statement are -- are -- are improper.

is inadmissible unless there's a waiver of the right

21

to the presence of counsel at that time.

22

MR. WAXMAN:

And in

So we start with the

Absolutely.

His statement

And that gets us

23

right to Elstad, and the line that this Court drew in

24

Elstad at the very outset of its opinion, which is

25

that the consequences of an interrogation in

violation of Miranda differ importantly from the

2

consequences of a violation of the Constitution

3

itself, that is, primary illegality that goes

4

directly, without prophylaxis, to what the

5

Constitution proscribes.

6

and over and over again in Elstad that we will not

7

apply a derivative evidence rule where the violation

8

is only the former, but we will apply it in the

9

latter.

10

And this Court said over

And that is the key distinction in this

11

case.

12

that they elicited from Mr. Fellers at his home

13

didn't also violate Miranda, if he was in custody and

14

the court found that he was, they did.

The distinction is not that the statements

MR. WAXMAN:

to you that it doesn't matter as a matter of

If it -- if it please the Court, this is
Once there is an indictment, the

10

police are not acting on their own.

The police are

11

part of the government prosecution, and if police

12

don't know that, and are trying to game the system

13

the way we heard it yesterday, it's the burden of the

14

prosecution -- the prosecution and the Government to

15

make sure that they do understand that.

16

What we're talking about here is the

17

preservation of -- as this Court has said it --

18

equality -- equality of each side once the Government

19

unilaterally define -- changes its posture with

20

respect to someone so that that person is accused,

21

and when it does that, it has to make -- it has to

22

take steps to avoid interfering with the ability of

23

the defendant at all critical stages and all

24

confrontations to proceed based on ignorance or

misapprehension of his rights or the legal

2

I realize this sounds like --

QUESTION:

Mr. Waxman, can I -- Mr.

4

Waxman, can I just clarify that we do have the

5

threshold question in this case, right?

6

it stands in the Eighth Circuit, you don't even have

7

a foot in the door because there was no

interrogation, it was only -- so we have to overturn

9

the Eighth Circuit on that point before we get to

10
11

Because as

what you're now talking about.
MR. WAXMAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

Now, the --

12

the Eighth Circuit was incorrect, because it applied

13

the wrong standard.

14

interrogation, when this Court made clear in Rhode

15

Island v. Innis that that is not the test under the

16

Sixth Amendment for good reasons, and in any event,

17

this was the, quote, functional equivalent of

18

interrogation.

19

It asked whether there was

I mean --

QUESTION:

Well, because of the Eighth

20

Circuit's position on the original statements, it

21

really didn't address the subsequent jailhouse

22

statements in any proper fashion, did it?

23

MR. WAXMAN:

No.

It -- it said -- what

24

the Eighth Circuit said is, look, we don't think that

25

there was a primary illegality, and therefore, we

MR. WAXMAN:

5

Right.
-- what the fruits

consequences are.
QUESTION:

So I suppose -- if we were to

6

agree with you on the first statements and conclude

7

they were deliberately elicited, we'd have to remand,

8

I suppose --

9

MR. WAXMAN:

I don't think so, Your Honor.

10

QUESTION: -- on the second question.

11

MR. WAXMAN:

Because the question

12

presented in the petition, the second question

13

presented in the petition is, okay, assuming that

14

there was a violation of the Sixth Amendment in the

15

first interrogation, does the invocation, the mere

16

invocation of Miranda warnings, cleanse that taint?

17

QUESTION:

No, it wasn't that --

18

QUESTION:

Well, except the Eighth Circuit

19

didn't address that second question.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WAXMAN: That's correct.

22

Right.

Well, would you like to say

something about it --

24

MR. WAXMAN:

I would.

taking drugs with these people.

5

question was whether he distributed drugs at the

station.

7

did consciously waive it.

8

since this case is about a right to a lawyer, maybe

9

if he'd had a lawyer it would have made a difference,

10

but it's hard to see how the decision not to have the

11

lawyer flowed from the first.

First, the questioning at the

They did ask him if he wanted a lawyer.

12

MR. WAXMAN:

13

QUESTION:

He

And therefore, in fact,

Well -So they're different subject

14

matters.

Time passes and it's pretty attenuated to

15

say that that first violation led him to the second.

16

All right.

Those are the arguments, et cetera.

17

MR. WAXMAN:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. WAXMAN:

Okay.
What do you say?
I'll -- I'll answer Justice

20

O'Connor's question first and then your question.

21

Justice O'Connor, the -- the -- the point here is

22

that this Court has uniformly held that where there

23

is conduct that constitutes primary illegality in

24

violation of the Fourth, Fifth, or Sixth Amendments,

25

not just a prophylactic rule, but the constitutional

1

requirement itself, the remedy is, you apply the

2

derivative evidence rule, which puts the burden on

3

the Government to prove that the taint has

4

sufficiently attenuated.

5

QUESTION:

But certainly the -- the -- the

6

defendant can waive his right to counsel later on,

7

and he did.

MR. WAXMAN:

QUESTION:

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION:

14

And our

case doesn't --

10

13

He absolutely can.

And he did.
He -Do you think it's tainted

simply because if we find a violation originally?
MR. WAXMAN:

Our -- our case, Your Honor,

15

doesn't depend on any argument or showing that the

16

second statement was either involuntary or that the

17

waiver of the right to counsel was not knowing and

18

intelligent.

19

statement is the fruit of the poisonous tree, just as

20

if it were a piece of inanimate evidence.

21

nothing wrong if somebody said -- with what the -- if

they got the -- that information derived from a

But he can certainly waive his

Sixth Amendment right later.

why what you say necessarily follows.

held that squarely, have we?

7

MR. WAXMAN:

I just don't understand
We've never

Well, you -- you have never

held in a Sixth Amendment --

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. WAXMAN:

No.
You've never held the -- the

10

precise question that's presented here for sure.

11

you have held that where there is conduct that

12

violates the Sixth Amendment, this is Nix and Wade,

13

the fruits of that conduct, regardless of what

14

happens thereafter, are excludable as fruit of the

15

poisonous tree, unless the Government shoulders its

16

taint-attenuation burden.

17

But

And you have also held in a variety of

18

cases that, starting with Wong Sun, that where the

19

fruit is testimonial evidence, it too has to be

20

excluded with the understanding that the administer

21

-- the intervening administration of Miranda warnings

22

are potent evidence, but they are not sufficient in

23

and of themselves to establish taint attenuation.

24

You said it in Brown.

You said it last term in Kaupp

You've said it in Dunaway and any number

of other cases.

3

QUESTION:

How is the second statement the

fruit of the first?

4

MR. WAXMAN: The first statement in the

5

first -- I mean, as a -- that -- this is a sort of a

6

common sense, practical analysis, but in the first

7

statement he was -- he acknowledged that he had used

8

methamphetamines and he had associated with the four

individuals that the police officer named.

And you,

Justice Breyer, the indictment was conspiracy to

and to distribute.

13

statements.

14

He made very inculpatory

Thirty minutes later, he executes a

15

Miranda warning -- waiver -- in the station house,

16

and he is asked, okay, tell us more about this

17

possession and tell us person by person about your

18

association with those four people.

19

and ask more questions about other people, but in

20

this case, the link between the two is as direct as

21

one can possibly imagine.

established a -- has long recognized a presumption

that where the -- when the Government acquires

evidence in violation of the Constitution, any

subsequent to that derives from it unless the

Government can prove it doesn't.

3

QUESTION:

That was waived.

I can under -- I can understand

4

the position, although I'm not entirely persuaded by

5

it, that where -- when you are violate -- have

6

violated the Fifth Amendment and gotten a confession

7

that's already on the table, the second confession is

8

sort of the fruit of that, because the person thinks,

9

what the heck, I've already confessed, I may as well

10

-- that's the argument that it's the fruit.

11

MR. WAXMAN:

12

QUESTION:

The taint -But I don't -- but I don't see

13

how the waiver of -- of counsel the second time is

14

the -- is the fruit of the improper approach the

15

first time.

16

saying, what the heck, I waived counsel the first

17

time, I may as well waive it the second.

I mean, I -- I don't see somebody

18

MR. WAXMAN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

Your Honor, the taint -That doesn't follow the way --

the way confession does.
MR. WAXMAN:

The taint, which this Court

22

in Elstad, in part IIa of its opinion in Elstad, said

23

was insufficient -- IIb -- was insufficient to prove

24

involuntariness, is in fact what demonstrates that

25

there is fruit of the poisonous tree here in the
26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

link, and that is the accepted, common sense

2

proposition that an uncounseled accused, from whom

3

the Government deliberately elicits an unwarned,

4

incriminatory statement after it institutes

5

adversarial proceedings, is erroneously likely to

6

believe that there is little to be gained and much to

7

be lost from attempting to avoid further

8

incrimination.

9

QUESTION:

Well, now, but is there -- is

10

there some authority for that specific proposition

11

that you just said?

12

MR. WAXMAN:

13

Bayer, in Brown, in --

14

This Court recognized it in

QUESTION: Did it say -- I -- I'm -- you --

15

you just recited kind of a litany.

16

recite that sort of a litany in Bayer?

17

MR. WAXMAN:

Did the Court

Well, in Brown, for example,

18

it said that the second warrant statement, quote, was

19

clearly the result and fruit of the first.

20

that Brown had made one statement believed by him to

21

be admissible bolstered the pressures for him to give

22

the second, or at least vitiated any incentive on his

23

part to avoid self-incrimination.

24
25

QUESTION:
a first statement.

The fact

But that -- that's a -- that's
That's -- you're -- you're
27

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

talking here about a waiver of counsel and you're

2

saying that's the same thing.

3

MR. WAXMAN:

It is the same thing.

In

4

that case they were talking about the second

5

statement, which was preceded by a waiver of counsel,

6

and making not the, Your Honor, not the legal

7

judgment that the second statement was there for

8

coerced or involuntary, but the practical -- what

9

this Court has described as the psychological and

10

practical disadvantage of having confessed a first

11

time can be regarded as a fruit of the first.

12

QUESTION:

Yeah, but isn't the -- the --

13

isn't the -- correct me if I'm wrong.

I think your

14

theory is that the waiver itself is likely to be a

15

fruit because a person is going to say, I've already

16

let the cat out of the bag, what do I need a lawyer

17

for.

Is -- is --

18

MR. WAXMAN: Yes.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. WAXMAN:

That's -- as --

-- that your position?
-- as -- as Justice Harlan

21

stated in his concurrence in Darwin, which is only a

22

concurrence, but I think is sort of the --

23
24
25

QUESTION:

Well, but that -- that's -- the

cat out of the bag is what we rejected in Elstad.
MR. WAXMAN:

You rejected it, Your Honor,
28

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as evidence or as constituting or -- or eliciting a

2

presumption of involuntariness.

3

after -- in part IIa of your opinion in Elstad, you

4

said, derivative evidence rule doesn't apply.

5

are not going to be excluded from Elstad -- from a

6

Miranda violation.

7

now we have to deal with the contention that he says

8

it's involuntary, and his only evidence that it's

9

involuntary is that it was the cat out of the bag and

10
11

But you did it only

Fruits

Now, the Court said in part IIb,

there was this psychological compulsion.
That's too attenuated and hypothetical to

12

constitute a presumption of compulsion, but it is

13

precisely what this Court has recognized in Brown and

14

Dunaway and Bayer and Taylor and Harrison as being a

15

psychological fact --

16

QUESTION:

And that should make the case

17

-- that case that we heard yesterday easier than this

18

one if that's the standard, because there, the first

19

unwarned set of questions was much more intense, much

20

more detailed than in this case.

21

MR. WAXMAN:

Right.

And the -- the only

22

burden in the -- in the case yesterday that I don't

23

have is that the primary illegality was a violation

24

of Miranda, and not of the Fifth Amendment

25

prohibition against coerced confessions itself.

Mr. Dreeben, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

5

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

6
7

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

8
9

Thank you, Mr. Waxman.

On the central legal issue in this case,
the critical fact is that, at the jailhouse, after

10

petitioner was transported from his home, petitioner

11

received a full set of Miranda warnings, which

12

apprised him of his right to counsel, and knowingly,

13

voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to

14

counsel.

15

QUESTION:

Did the Eighth Circuit ever

16

decide whether there was a knowing and voluntary

17

waiver at the jailhouse?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

Yes.

I believe that the

19

Eighth Circuit did, Justice O'Connor, because the

20

Eighth Circuit applied Oregon v. Elstad to reject

21

what appears to be a Miranda-style argument that

22

petitioner made in addition to his Sixth Amendment

23

argument.

24
25

QUESTION:

I thought that perhaps since

they didn't think the first statement posed a problem
30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that they never really got to the crux of the

2

jailhouse inquiry.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- I think in -- in

4

part, Justice O'Connor, your reading of the opinion

5

is correct.

6

the Sixth Amendment argument that petitioner is

7

making in this Court doesn't get out of the starting

8

gate, because there was no interrogation, it used the

9

word interrogation.

The court did say that under Patterson,

There was an issue about whether

10

interrogation is equivalent to deliberate

11

elicitation, and I'll try to address that.

12

But before the court got to the Sixth

13

Amendment question, it addressed on pages 121 and 122

14

of the joint appendix the argument based on Elstad,

15

and the argument that the petitioner made was that

16

the statements made at the jailhouse should be

17

suppressed -- and this is on page 121 of the joint

18

appendix -- because the primary taint of the

19

improperly elicited statements made at his home was

20

not removed by the recitation of his Miranda rights

21

at the jail.

22

And then the court went on to discuss

23

Oregon v. Elstad in detail and rejected that holding,

24

that argument.

25

passage is that the court affirmed the district

And the way that I interpret that

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

court's explicit finding of a knowing, voluntary, and

2

intelligent waiver, and applied Elstad to reject that

3

claim.

4

QUESTION:

Just so I understand what the

5

Sixth Amendment rule is, if the Sixth Amendment

6

prohibits the state from eliciting statements when

7

the defend -- when proceedings have begun, outside

8

presence of counsel, is it wrong for them to give the

9

Miranda warning and if he's then silent, then go

10

ahead and say, now you've had your Miranda warning,

11

would you like to talk to us?

12

with the Sixth Amendment rules that we impose?

13

is to say, can you elicit the statement after you've

14

given the waiver, consistently with the Sixth

15

Amendment right?

16

MR. DREEBEN:

Is that consistent

Yes.

That

Patterson v. Illinois

17

specifically addressed the question of what does it

18

take for officers to obtain a waiver of counsel.

19

only point where I would disagree, Justice Kennedy,

20

with your summary is that presence of counsel is not

21

required.

22

whether to have or to waive counsel.

23

The

The defendant has the right to choose

And in Patterson, the Court held that the

24

Miranda warnings conveyed to a suspect who has been

25

indicted all of the information needed to make a

2

counsel in custodial interrogation.

3

petitioner got.

4
5

QUESTION:

That's what

And they can attempt to elicit

that waiver consistently with the Sixth Amendment?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

That's correct.

They can

7

approach the defendant, apprise him of his rights,

8

and if the defendant then makes a knowing and

9

intelligent waiver of his rights --

10

QUESTION:

No, that wasn't my question.

11

Can they -- can they advise him of those rights, he's

12

silent, and then try to elicit the statement?

13

now we've apprised you of your rights and we want you

14

to talk to us.

15

Amendment?

16

Say,

Is that consistent with the Sixth

MR. DREEBEN:

I think so, if that's

17

construed as seeking a waiver of his right to

18

counsel.

19

there was in fact a waiver of the right to counsel.

20

The police officers can't simply read Miranda

21

warnings, provide no interruption whatsoever to make

22

sure that the defendant actually understood them, and

23

then barge right ahead.

24
25

Of course, there has to be a finding that

Now, there are cases where the courts have
to decide whether there was an implicit waiver of
33
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

2

case like that, because the Miranda waiver form in

3

the record clearly indicates --

4

QUESTION:

But, Mr. Dreeben, maybe I'm

5

wrong on the facts, but you're relying on the waiver

6

at the station house?

7

MR. DREEBEN:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Do you agree that prior to that

waiver there had already been a violation of the
Sixth Amendment?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

12

QUESTION:

13
14

That's correct.

No, Justice Stevens.

Our --

Well, then -- then you don't

need the waiver.
MR. DREEBEN:

That -- that is true.

I --

15

my submission is on the critical legal question.

16

Even if the Court finds against us on what I would

17

acknowledge is a close question about whether the

18

interaction at the home constituted deliberate

19

elicitation under the Sixth Amendment --

20
21
22

QUESTION:
elicitation.

Assume it was deliberate

Would you say it was a violation then?

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I wouldn't say that it

23

was a -- an actual violation of the Sixth Amendment

24

at the time.

25

The right to counsel has to be evaluated by reference

The Sixth Amendment is a trial right.

the Constitution?

MR. DREEBEN:

I -- I

want to make it perfectly clear, Justice Stevens --

7
8

Not at that time.

QUESTION:

It seems to me a rather extreme

position.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I -- I don't think it

10

is extreme, because I'm going to follow it up with

11

what I think Your Honor is getting to, which is, can

12

the police simply go to an indicted suspect's home,

13

ignore his right to counsel, and engage in

14

questioning?

15

sometimes yes.

16

defendant has been indicted, the right to counsel

17

provides a -- a direction to the police not to

18

interfere with or circumvent the right to counsel.

19
20
21

And the answer is, generally no,
The generally no is that once the

QUESTION:

Well, what is the sometimes

yes?
MR. DREEBEN: Sometimes yes is that, this

Court has recognized in its seminal case in this

MR. DREEBEN:

That -- that has been the

way that this Court has formulated the test, and I

would suggest that if --

QUESTION:

And so should we apply that

test here to those early statements?
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, but I think the Court

8

should clearly reformulate it to make it in the

9

context of overt interrogation by the police, known

10

police officers, to be an objective test.

11

deliberate elicitation standard, as so phrased, gives

12

rise to some confusion, because it does suggest that

13

there's a subjective component to it, where

14

deliberate elicitation does have a different

15

application than interrogation for purposes of

16

Miranda with respect to undercover agents.

17

has made clear that once a suspect is indicted, the

18

police cannot use an undercover agent, not known or

identified as such to the defendant, to circumvent

his right to counsel.

deliberate elicitation is broader.

The Court

And in that respect,

But in footnote 12 of Maine v. Moulton

23

where the Court was discussing deliberate elicitation

in some detail, the Court made clear that intent is

hard to prove, and it's really not the main issue

here anyway.

What we should be interested in is

2

whether the Government must have known that its

3

conduct would be likely to elicit incriminating

4

statements, and that is essentially the same as the

5

Rhode Island v. Innis standard for interrogation.

6

fact, it's a little bit more onerous for the

7

defendant, because it says, must have known, and the

8

Rhode Island v. Innis standard is should have known.

9

In any event, the Government submits that

In

10

the Court should make it clearer that when you're

11

dealing with identified police officers interacting

12

with suspects post-indictment, the Rhode Island v.

13

Innis standard, the objective test should be the

14

definition of deliberate elicitation.

15

question becomes, was there deliberate elicitation on

the record in this case?

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

3

Justice --

Wasn't it Bliemeister's

statement, I'm here to discuss with you?

4

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, on three

5

occasions when Officer Bliemeister was asked to say

6

what he said in his own words, he said, we're here to

7

discuss your methamphetamine activities.

8

occasion, when defense counsel in cross-examination

9

reformulated what Officer Bliemeister said, and said,

10

didn't you say you're here to discuss with petitioner

11

his methamphetamine activities, Officer Bliemeister

12

answered yes.

district court did not use the with you language in

describing what the officer said.

On one

Both the magistrate judge and the

15

And to the extent that this case turns on

16

a rather subtle distinction in language, I think the

17

distinction is relevant, because what the officers

18

were essentially doing is introducing the topic of

19

what they were going to tell petitioner, namely, your

methamphetamine activities have landed you in

21

trouble, we're here to arrest you, we have an

8

MR. DREEBEN:

Who

I don't think there was any

9

ambiguity about the object of the statements, but the

10

question of what the officers were intending to do is

11

somewhat informed by the way they phrased it.

12

QUESTION:

No, but the -- the usual sense

13

of the word discuss is something that involves other

14

than -- something involving more than a monologue.

15

So I mean, I -- as Justice Scalia said, I -- it might

16

make it clearer if he had said with you each time,

then what, with regard to the subsequent conversation

of the jail, after the warnings had been given?

19

MR. DREEBEN:

Then I think, Justice

20

O'Connor, that this Court should apply its rule in

21

Oregon v. Elstad that the knowing, voluntary, and

intelligent waiver of the right to counsel

23

constitutes an independent act of free will that

24

breaks any causal link that might otherwise have been

posited between the statements that were made in the

MR. DREEBEN:

Not only do I think that it

8

was made explicitly in the district court and

9

implicitly in the court of appeals, but I don't

10

believe that petitioner contests it.

11

that petitioner's position is that the waiver of

12

rights was actually tainted.

13

petitioner's position to be is that there was a

14

violation of a primary constitutional norm at home

15

when -- when petitioner was interrogated or

16

statements were deliberately elicited.

MR. DREEBEN:

I don't believe

The same fruits

22

Amendment precedents, which the Government does not

think are -- are applicable here.

24
25

QUESTION:

I - I think -- I think he would

say it is a fruit because it is not totally

1

voluntary, given the fact that he had already let the

2

cat out of the bag.

3

don't think he would acknowledge that the second

4

waiver -- that the waiver of counsel in the second

5

interrogation was entirely free, given what had

6

preceded.

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, Justice Scalia, I'll

have to let petitioner's briefs speak for what --

10

I -- I -- I don't think -- I

QUESTION:

Well, we -- we've destroyed his

right of rebuttal, so --

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION:

And that's the question

13

basically, because I think that's an important

14

question and -- and the question is whether there is

15

a right to a lawyer, and when the Government violates

16

the right to the lawyer, like the Fourth Amendment or

17

any other amendment, they can't use a fruit.

18

Oregon v. Elstad is talking about a right that isn't

19

complete until you fail to introduce the -- until you

20

use it as testimony at trial, and therefore Oregon v.

21

Elstad is a different, and considerably more lenient

22

test.

23

this moment that our Court cases said you apply the

24

fruits because the violation is complete.

25

Now,

I confess I always would have thought until

Now, it seems to me in advocating the
44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

second, you're advocating a considerable change, but

2

whether it's a change or not a change, I want to know

3

the reason for it.

4

MR. DREEBEN:

There are two critical

5

reasons, Justice Breyer, why Oregon v. Elstad should

6

apply in this context.

7

that the defendant did not get, by hypothesis now, at

8

home, was the right to make an informed waiver of the

9

right to counsel.

The first is that the right

When the defendant got the Miranda

10

warnings at home, that fully cured any deficiency in

11

knowledge that the defendant previously had about his

12

right to counsel, and enabled him to make an act of

13

free will that broke any causal link between the

14

first statements and the second statements.

15

And the second crucial reason why Elstad

16

should apply here is Elstad is not simply limited to

17

reasoning that is only applicable in the context of

18

compulsion under the Fifth Amendment.

19

clearly and explicitly said, it's very speculative

20

and attenuated to posit that a defendant who spoke at

21

one time is therefore going to believe that the cat

22

is out of the bag and I should speak again, I don't

23

really have a choice.

24
25

QUESTION:

Right.

It also

But as to the first, my

Constitution says you have a right to a lawyer, not
45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- of course you can waive it, like anybody -- other

2

right.

3

Amendment right, which is a right not to testify

4

against yourself, which is in complete to a trial.

But that's quite different than the Fifth

5

As to the second, of course, attenuation

6

is relevant.

7

doctrine.

8

prove attenuation, fine.

9

why do we have to change the law here?

10

It's relevant under the tree -- fruits

It's relevant under Elstad.

So if you

So, given those two things,
Or is it a

change?

11

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, I don't think it's a

12

change, Justice Breyer, because the Court has never

13

addressed the specific dynamic involved in this case

14

under the Sixth Amendment of a defendant who makes an

15

unwarned statement --

16
17

QUESTION:

Well, the Nix v. Williams case

bears on it to some extent, doesn't it?

18

MR. DREEBEN:

19

QUESTION:

20
21

It does --

That was a Sixth Amendment

case.
MR. DREEBEN:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, and I

22

-- I accept, although I think it's fair to say that

23

Nix did no more than assume that there would be a

24

fruits rule as to physical evidence.

25

QUESTION:

Yeah.

And the Court in Nix
46

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

2

fruits suppression.

3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10

MR. DREEBEN:

Correct.

As to physical

evidence.
QUESTION:

But applied some other reason

to let the body -MR. DREEBEN:

Well, the Court -- the Court

there relied on inevitable discovery.
QUESTION:

Right.

MR. DREEBEN:

Here, our basic position is

11

that the voluntary testimony of the defendant himself

12

is different from physical fruits or from the

13

situation involving a tainted line-up, which was

14

involved in Wade, and that the decision, made

15

voluntarily and intelligently by a defendant to waive

16

counsel, is a per se break in any causal chain that

17

would be positive.

18

And our second argument is that the Court

19

has already rejected in Elstad the idea that there is

20

a causal link between a defendant's letting a cat out

21

of the bag in the first statement and then being

22

confronted with the question whether to waive his

23

rights in the second.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Dreeben, do -- do I

understand correctly that essentially you are saying
47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that Mr. Waxman in wrong in bracketing the Sixth

2

Amendment with the Fourth Amendment, that it belongs

3

with the Fifth Amendment?

4

large difference between the two of you is Mr. Waxman

5

describes the Sixth Amendment violation of -- as

6

occurring on the spot.

7

it's just like the Fifth Amendment.

8

inchoate until the Government seeks to introduce it

9

at a trial.

And one, it seems to me,

You have said in your brief
It's sort of

Is that still your view, so that the --

10

the right to counsel isn't complete -- the violation

11

isn't complete until the Government makes an effort

12

to introduce it at trial?

13

MR. DREEBEN:

It is.

My view that the

14

violation is not complete until the evidence is

15

introduced at trial, but I think where I put the

16

Sixth Amendment is not numerically accurate, but it's

17

somewhere in between the Fourth and the Fifth

18

Amendment rules, in that there are circumstances in

19

which I believe that there is a fruits rule attached

20

to conduct that infringes a Sixth Amendment norm.

21

The right itself may not be a completed violation

22

until evidence that results from infringing a Sixth

23

Amendment norm is actually used against the

24

defendant.

25

Sixth Amendment.

Adversarial fairness is the goal of the

the Constitution.

2

QUESTION:

Because if -- if the -- we

3

describe that right, that Sixth Amendment amendment

4

right as a right to counsel at every critical stage

5

in the criminal proceeding, then that sounds like

6

there's a critical stage and you haven't been told

7

and haven't waived your right to a lawyer, the

8

violation is complete.

9

MR. DREEBEN:

No, I don't think so,

10

Justice Ginsburg.

11

the point very clear is this Court's ineffective

12

assistance of counsel cases.

13

only that a lawyer performs deficiently, below any

14

reasonable professional standard, but also that there

15

be an effect on the fairness of the trail in the form

16

of prejudice.

I mean, we're playing with words.

What

we're saying in the counsel cases is, if we have to

than simply the deficiency.

The question here is -- is asked, I think,

was the denial of the -- of the opportunity to waive.

11

But he's got to have an opportunity to waive

12

something, and I suppose that implies that he has, at

13

least on a prospective basis, a right to the presence

14

of counsel there if the police are going to question

15

him, absent a -- a waiver.

But you don't have quite the

QUESTION:

But Mr. Dreeben, it's -- the

the waiver was intelligent and voluntary and so

QUESTION:

It's a rather dramatic

13

difference in the kind of waiver of this very

14

important right.

15

MR. DREEBEN:

True.

But that's what the

16

Court held over Your Honor's dissent in Patterson v.

17

Illinois.

18

of what kind of a waiver is necessary, and the Court

19

held that the issuance of Miranda warnings provides

20

the defendant with all the information that he needs

21

to know.

22
23

The Court explicitly considered the issue

QUESTION:

MR. DREEBEN:

And we're not claiming that

2

there was a waiver of the right to counsel.

3

our claim for whatever favor it may meet with the

4

Court is that there was no deliberate elicitation of

5

statements.

6

We are unequivocally claiming a waiver at the

7

jailhouse.

8

Our --

We're not claiming a waiver at the home.

QUESTION:

Don't you think it is a rather

9

-- rather strange that the judges are as careful as

10

they are in a trial setting, whereas the police can

11

just do what they did here?

12

trouble you?

13

Does that -- doesn't

MR. DREEBEN: No, I don't think it's

14

strange at all, because as the Court explained in

15

Patterson, the question of a waiver is a functional

16

question that turns on what the role of counsel might

17

be at a particular setting.

18

at trial is considerably more complex in dealing with

19

evidentiary matters and legal claims than the role in

20

pre-trial interrogation.

21

QUESTION:

Now, the role of counsel

Actually, in -- in a situation

22

like this, the whole outcome of the proceeding is

23

determined by what happened in his home.

24
25

MR. DREEBEN:

Well, in this particular

case, and this is my third and final point, if the
53
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Court should determine that the waiver of rights is

2

not a per se independent act that attenuates any

3

taint, on any record the Court should not find that

4

there is any taint that is unattenuated.

5

violation at home, if there was any, was an extremely

6

mild violation.

7

the bag, it was really at most one paw, not an entire

8

cat.

The

If the defendant let the cat out of

(Laughter.)
MR. DREEBEN:

The -- the defendant barely

11

spoke at all about his activities relating to the

12

charges that were identified in the indictment.

13

said that he had business and personal problems and

14

he was a methamphetamine user, and he rambled on for

15

a while until the police cut him off.

16

house, he was asked specifically person by person

17

what his relationship was with the individual and

18

what the activities were, and of course, he gave more

19

elaborate information at that time, but -- and this

20

is critical too.

21

admitted the charges in the indictment.

22

a case where a defendant said, well, I've confessed

23

once, I might as well confess again now that I have

24

my Miranda warning.

25

about his problems at his home, then he gets down to

He

1

the station house and he's essentially talking about

2

all the things that make him not liable, criminally

3

liable under the indictment.

4

It was an instance in which, I would

5

submit, the motive for the defendant to talk was not

6

that the cat was out of the bag, but that he was

7

hoping to minimize any suggestion of guilt and

8

persuade the officers that the indictment was not

9

properly founded.

10

And finally, of course, the officers never

11

exploited any prior statement and they did give him a

12

thorough, complete administration of Miranda

13

warnings, and under the circumstances of this case,

14

even if the Court were to apply a taint analysis

15

sometimes, or to assume that a taint analysis

16

applies, the facts of this case demonstrate enough

17

attenuation so that the jailhouse statements should

18

be admitted, while the statements at home were

19

suppressed.

20

QUESTION:

Are -- are you arguing that the

21

fruits rule does not apply, or are you arguing that

22

this is not the fruits?

23

MR. DREEBEN:

I am arguing that a fruits

24

rule applies under the Sixth Amendment.

I'm

25

conceding that by virtue of the Court's assumption in

Nix v. Williams and its holding in United States v.

2

Wade.

3

statements should be treated as a special case under

4

a fruits rule in which there is per se attenuation in

5

the form of an independent act of free will that

6

intervenes between the violation and the ensuing

7

waiver.

8

receives full and complete information about his

9

rights.

10

But the case of a defendant's own voluntary

And that comes about when the defendant

There is no suggestion of involuntariness in

his waiver and he decides to speak.

11

The ultimate test in attenuation law is

12

was there an independent act of free will when you're

13

speaking of a confession that breaks the causal link

14

to the prior illegality.

15

of law under Oregon v. Elstad's reasoning, there was.
