ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Petitioner, like thousands of other employers

12

throughout this country, has a policy that if an employee

13

is discharged for violating a workplace rule -- usually

14

that involves serious misconduct in the -- in the

15

workplace -- then he becomes permanently ineligible to be

16

rehired by that particular employer.

17

The court of appeals in this case correctly held

18

at Fed.App. 12a, note 17, that there is no question that

19

petitioner applied this policy in rejecting respondent's

20

application.

21

there's no question that this policy on its face is not

22

unlawful.

And the court of appeals also held that

23

Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit declared that

24

even in a case alleging only disparate treatment, the,

25

quote, policy violates the ADA as applied to former drug

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

addicts whose only work-related offense was testing

2

positive because of their addiction.

3

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, it -- the Ninth Circuit

4

in its opinion on about page 8a in the appendix said,

5

Hernandez raises a genuine issue of material fact as to

6

whether he was denied reemployment because of his past

7

record of drug addiction.

8

court may have said there is a genuine issue of fact here,

9

that it wasn't clear whether there was a no-hire policy

10

that was either adopted or if it was used in this case,

11

that there's something else at stake due to the different

12

responses of the man who wrote the letter versus the woman

13

who actually made the decision, and that there's some

14

issue of fact here.

15
16
17

And I'm concerned that the

Now, if that's the case, maybe the rest of the
opinion is just dicta.
MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't know.
It's pretty clear that the rest

18

of the opinion is not dicta, Justice O'Connor.

19

that portion of the analysis is -- is directed solely at

20

the question of whether or not the plaintiff had made out

21

a prima facie case, and what the court said was, you know,

22

is there any evidence from which anyone could draw the

23

inference that there was discrimination because of a

24

disability.

25

very close question, that if you read even the -- the

The --

And it recognized frankly that that was a

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

statement made to the EEOC, you can read that in different

2

ways.

Maybe you should look at Bockmiller.

3

But the truth is in making the prima facie

4

showing, all that you really needed to look at was the

5

policy statement -- or the -- the response to the EEOC,

6

and that would be enough, I think, to get you past the

7

prima facie showing.

8
9

It -- it is at page 10a where the court then
turns its complete attention, and it says, you know, so in

10

sum we hold that -- that Hernandez's prima facie case of

11

discrimination has been made out, and now we turn to the

12

next stage in the process, which is to look and see

13

whether or not there is a -- a non-pretextual

14

justification.

15

QUESTION:

I might agree with you that a no-hire

16

policy, if that's what was used, is certainly not

17

unlawful.

18

what -- what do we do?

19

But if there is a genuine issue of fact here,

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if there were a genuine

20

issue of fact, you -- you would -- you know, you'd remand

21

to allow the case to go forward.

22

genuine issue of fact because if you -- once you get past

23

just looking at the EEOC statement that was made by the

24

employer and -- and you're in the district court and

25

you're looking at summary judgment and the question is

There's clearly not a

5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whether or not the action of the employer is pretextual,

2

we only have the burden to come forward and say we had a

3

-- a perfectly lawful reason for doing what we did.

4

QUESTION:

Well, aren't the two questions really

5

severable, whether the Ninth Circuit's treatment of the

6

no-rehire policy was correct under ADA law, and second,

7

whether the employer was entitled to summary judgment?

8

-- I think those are two different questions.

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I -- yes, they are two

10

different questions, Mr. Chief Justice.

11

answer is that I think we probably would have been

12

entitled to summary judgment even on the prima facie

13

showing.

14

I

I think the

The only way the court of appeals got to its

15

analysis -- the only way it could have gotten there under

16

Hazen Paper -- is to say that the pretextual basis -- the

17

pretextual argument that was put forward by the employer

18

-- we have to take that off the table because if that --

19

if that policy is in this case, there is not a shred of

20

evidence that that policy was not applied in this

21

particular case.

22

appeals said in -- in the footnote in its opinion.

23

said that's unquestioned.

24
25

And that's exactly what the court of

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, I'm having the same

problem that Justice O'Connor and the Chief expressed.

6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

One thing is if we take this case, there's a no-hire rule.

2

Can an employer have such a rule and apply it with even

3

hand?

4

That's a question of law.
But this case seems to be underneath messier.

5

For example, this no-hire policy was unwritten.

8

testify we had a right, not that we'd apply it every case,

9

but we had a right not to rehire someone who was

Why was it unwritten?

11

The -- the record is suspicious on, one, whether

12

there was a policy; two, whether it was applied with an

13

even hand.

14

take this as given that there was indeed such a policy and

15

that it -- it was applied with an even hand?

16

questions remain in the case?

17

they had such a policy and if they applied it with an even

18

hand, they would not be offending --

19

That one can't tell.

MR. PHILLIPS:

So why should a judge

Don't those

Even if you prevail on if

I mean, there's no question that

20

respondent has asserted arguments that the -- that -- that

21

there's a question as to whether the policy exists.

Ninth Circuit expressly held that the policy exists and

23

was applied in this particular case --

Well, they held it in a footnote, and

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't take footnotes seriously

in all court's opinions, Your Honor.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, but I mean, it could not

5

have been more explicit in terms of dealing with this

6

particular issue.

7

was -- did the policy exist and was it applied in this

8

particular case?

9

Was the policy presented and was it --

There's no question about that.

And there's no testimony that raises any doubt.

10

It may be that it's an unwritten policy, but the testimony

11

in the joint appendix at 22a, 57a, 59a, 71a, 72a, and 73a,

12

which is the affidavit and deposition testimony of

13

Bockmiller who was the decision maker in this case and

14

Medina who signed the -- the statement, is consistent,

15

that -- that there is an absolute policy and practice that

16

this employer uniformly uses.

17

QUESTION:

We don't know from this record, for

18

example, whether someone who had sexually harassed a

19

fellow worker and for that reason was fired, whether such

20

a policy would apply -- has, in fact, been applied to such

21

a person, whether someone who assaulted a co-worker would

22

also be barred permanently from re-hire.

23

firm policy, then it's unquestionably legal, but -- but

24

there isn't in this anything except two employees who gave

25

testimony, no other examples, other than this very case,

If there is the

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to show that this has been applied across the board.

2

MR. PHILLIPS:

But Justice Ginsburg, the

3

respondent had a full opportunity for discovery in this

4

case.

5

of any instances in which this rule hadn't been applied,

6

he could presumably have brought that forward.

7

could have discovered any instance in which this rule had

8

not been applied consistently --

He was an employee for 25 years.

9
10

QUESTION:

If he had known

If he

I thought he said that he didn't even

know the rule existed.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

Actually he's not specific in --

12

in regard to that.

13

this stage in the proceedings, but there's nothing in the

14

record, certainly nothing during the deposition testimony,

15

in which he says -- there's nothing in his affidavit.

16

I mean, he's made that argument at

But -- but, Justice O'Connor, it's worth reading

17

the joint appendix -- I'm sorry, Justice Ginsburg.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

But, Justice Ginsburg, it's worth

21

reading on joint appendix 70a.

22

stealing or fighting or anything like that.

24

unequivocal, absolutely uncontradicted testimony in this

25

record.

QUESTION:

Mr. Phillips, can I ask you a

2

question that makes the assumption that you want to make

3

for the whole case, that the policy was just applied in

4

this case?

5

-- and has the history of this person, and say you would

6

admit he's qualified.

7

that in this case.

8

history of drug or alcohol use and was fired for that

9

years ago, writes a letter to the company and says I'm

10

totally aware of your policy of not hiring -- rehiring

11

people who were previously discharged for cause, but I

12

want you to know I am a rehabilitated person and therefore

13

I'm handicapped and I come within the statute.

14

think the -- the rule against discriminating against

15

handicaps requires you to make a special accommodation for

16

me.

Suppose a person, aware of the policy, right

I know there's some doubt about

A qualified applicant, who has a

And I

Please do so.

17

Now, why could you turn him down?

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, you could -- you could

19

continue to assert that the -- that our policy is our

20

policy and we're entitled to assert that policy.

21

Now, you know, there are alternative theories

22

that could be brought forward.

23

the policy has a disparate impact, which wasn't litigated

24

in this case --

25

QUESTION:

One -- one could be that

reason for the policy doesn't apply --

answers to that in terms of the reasonable accommodation

This is one

who's merely regarded as or has a record of.

18

First of all, remember that this is not an

So there -- there are no

So I think (b)(5) by its terms doesn't

QUESTION:

Is it your view there's no duty to

19

accommodate for applicants?

20

your view that the statute does not require any

21

accommodation for applicants as opposed to actually

22

employed persons?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm just trying to -- is it

No, I don't -- I don't know that

24

that doesn't require any -- anything with respect to

25

applicants or any accommodation with respect to

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

applicants.

I don't -- I -- I think what it doesn't do is

2
3

allow you to look beyond whether there are limitations

4

that need to be accommodated.

5

I don't think it is a reasonable accommodation within the

6

meaning of (b)(5) to say that you're entitled to a second

7

bite of the apple.

8

and been discharged for that reason, whether it's drug-

9

related or not, it seems to me clear under the statute --

10

certainly it's clear under -- under 114(c)(4) -- that that

11

is precisely the situation in which the employer is

12

allowed to discharge you and to impose on you a permanent

13

ban.

14

QUESTION:

And I don't think it -- and

If you have violated a misconduct rule

Well, the discharge isn't in

16

handicapped within the meaning of the statute and who was

17

previously discharged for a reason that clearly does not

18

justify rehiring now, other than the fact you want to have

19

a rule with no exceptions to it.

20

little unclear as to if you don't say the duty to

21

accommodate has no application to applicants as opposed to

22

employees, I'm a little unclear as to why this isn't like

23

a rule in the gender discrimination cases, you can't lift

24

over 100 pounds or something like that.

25

The question is whether a person who is now

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't really -- I'm a

Well, because I think the reason

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

is is that in order to allow this employee to come back

2

under these circumstances, you have to -- you have to

3
4

discriminate in his favor because if -- if this were a

5

person who --

6
7

QUESTION:

That's right, and that's always the

case of -- of accommodation.

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

QUESTION:

10
11

Right.

It's always a discrimination in favor

of the applicant.
MR. PHILLIPS:

Right, but that's why you have to

12

look at 114(c)(4), which says specifically that you are

13

entitled to treat former drug addicts precisely the way

14

you would treat any other employee.

15

I think is if this employee had been discharged originally

16

because he was a sex offender or a sexual harasser and --

17

and had a psychological reason for it, and he came back in

18

and he said, I'm -- I'm cured, I'm fixed, I want to come

19

back to work now, the answer there might be one thing.

20

don't know the -- you know, there may be a reasonable

21

accommodation issue there.

22

So then the question

I

But with respect to 114(c)(4), which very

23

specifically says that you're allowed to impose

24

qualification standards that are the same where you're not

25

going to allow that other employee to come in -- that's

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the way your policy operates -- applying that rule fairly

2

to this situation means that this employee is not entitled

3

to come in.

4
5

I don't think it's a flat rule against

6

applicants versus non-applicants.

7

-- 114(c)(4) rule that says that you are always entitled

8

to treat the rehabilitated drug addict exactly the same

9

way you would treat anyone else who engaged in misconduct.

10

QUESTION:

I think it's a (c)(4)

Mr. Phillips, I guess the Ninth

11

Circuit did not address at all the reasonable

12

accommodation question, did it?

13
14

MR. PHILLIPS:

I don't think it did address the

reasonable accommodation issue.

15

QUESTION:

16

in getting into it, but it --

No.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

So I guess we'd have a hard time

Any more than it --

-- may be a serious question.
Well, it might be and -- and I

20

don't think it would be in this case.

21

114(c)(4) is a complete answer to the reasonable

22

accommodation argument, and I think frankly 114(c)(4) is a

23

complete answer to the disparate impact argument, which

24

the court of appeals also not only didn't get into, but

25

found had been expressly waived.

As I say, I think

14

That's why I think, Justice O'Connor, at the end

of the day, what this case is about is Hazen Paper.

is not a shred of evidence that it wasn't applied.

QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Phillips, one of the things

7

is -- doesn't quite fit is in the case of this very

employee.

9

-- no-rehire rule.

He was given a test despite this firm no-hire
They did give him a test in 1999, and

10

it turned out he flunked it badly.

11

recognizes that flunking in 1999, when you're a little

12

rusty, doesn't mean you would have flunked in 1994, which

13

is the critical time here.

14

has this firm -- firm, no-exception policy, no rehires,

15

why did it give him the test to see if he was qualified?

16

MR. PHILLIPS:

But everyone

But why did the company, if it

Well, because any employers who's

in the middle of litigation would be irrational not to try

problem.

20

solution to the problem.

21

1999, it wasn't available to us to bring him back or to

try to come up with some other kind of a settlement.

think it completely inappropriate to hold it against us to

have required us to take the time of the court at that

Mr. Phillips, looking at 114(c)(4), I

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I think the answer to that

is (c)(4) would -- would trump the reasonable

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

accommodation argument, if -- if it had been properly

2

raised and it were before the court.

3

of the day, we'd win that, but Justice O'Connor -- I got

4

the name right there -- is clearly right that that issue

5

wasn't resolved by the Ninth Circuit, and therefore

6

remains open.

I think at the end

I mean, it is not an issue for this Court

7
8

at this point.

9

I just want to make it absolutely clear that the

10

rule was applied -- I don't think there is any way that

11

you can question that there is an issue of fact to be

12

resolved as to how this rule was applied in this

13

circumstance.

14

the rule as the basis for Mr. Hernandez's rejection, you

15

have to declare that Ms. Bockmiller flat-out lied, and she

16

didn't.

17

consistent with the idea that she looked at the summary

18

separation, she concluded that there was no basis to go

19

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

8

10
11

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. CLEMENT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

12

A policy -- a mutual policy of refusing to

13

rehire individuals previously terminated for serious

14

misconduct does not constitute disparate treatment for

15

purposes of the Americans with Disabilities Act even as

16

applied to an individual previously discharged for drug-

17

related misconduct.

18

who are addicted or those who test positive for drugs for

19

disfavorable treatment.

20

misconduct, whether drug-related or not, the same.

21

The policy does not single out people

The policy treats all serious

As a result, an individual who is refused re-

22

employment pursuant to that policy is simply not subject

23

to disparate treatment because of their disability.

24
25

QUESTION:

Mr. Clement, does the Government take

a position on whether there's an issue of fact hidden in

18
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

this case about whether there is a neutral no-hire policy?
MR. CLEMENT:

Justice O'Connor, in our brief we

3

suggested that it would be possible to grant summary

4

judgment for the employer here on this record.

5

confess, though, that that issue is of considerable less

6

importance to the Government than the broader validity of

7

this rule.

8

summary judgment might be appropriate, but I want to

I have to

One thing I -- I'll address why we think

9
10

emphasize, though, that even if the Court thinks that

11

summary judgment is not appropriate here, the proper

12

disposition would be to vacate and remand.

13

But it's very important to vacate the opinion

14

because the theory of the Ninth Circuit, if you can divine

15

one here, is that, all right, there's a pretextual case

16

for discrimination and the employer comes in and says, we

17

didn't discriminate on the basis of disability.

18

applied a neutral, across-the-board rule.

19

the Ninth Circuit opinion, what they say is that neutral

20

rule is not a legitimate, nondiscriminatory basis for your

21

employment action.

22

of law, and that is a profoundly wrong decision as a

23

matter of law, especially in a disparate treatment case

24

because Justice Stevens suggested that maybe you could

25

have a reasonable accommodation theory but that's not in

We

And as I read

And they -- they do that as a matter

1

this case.

2

12112(b)(6), which embodies the Americans with

3

Disabilities Act disparate impact principles, could be

4

used to challenge the neutral policy.

5

is true, when an employer applies a neutral policy, it has

6

not engaged in disparate treatment on the basis of

7

disability.

8
9

It is possible that the language of 42 U.S.C.

But whatever else

Now, if I can get back to the summary judgment
question.

I think there's two reasons why we thought

10
11

summary judgment was -- would be appropriate for the

12

employer.

13

One is as suggested by Mr. Phillips.

14

footnote 17, after the court of appeals finishes with its

15

pretext analysis, it seems to suggest that there's really

16

no dispute that both sides agree that this policy was

17

invoked.

18

court record, it doesn't seem like the gravamen of the

19

respondent's case was that the policy doesn't exist.

20

was more a -- a suggestion that whether or not you have a

21

policy, as to me in particular that's not the reason for

22

the discharge, and the best evidence of that, of course,

23

is the letter that George Medina sent to the EEOC.

24
25

In

And I think in -- in looking through the lower

QUESTION:

It

You mean the best evidence supporting

the plaintiff.

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT:

Yes, the best evidence that the

2

plaintiff has is that letter to the EEOC from Mr. Medina.

3

And, of course, that letter suggests that it was more

4

complicated than simply application of a neutral policy,

5

and it's for that reason that the EEOC issued a -- a cause

6

to sue letter.

7

Unfortunately, though, Mr. -- Mr. Medina was not

8

the ultimate decision maker in this case.

9

Bockmiller.

10

That was Joanne

And the record is clear -- and this is at

joint appendix 51a and then 64a.

It's clear that Ms.

11
12

Bockmiller did not participate in the preparation of that

13

Medina letter.

14

QUESTION:

Then why did the company --

15

QUESTION:

I don't know that -- I don't know

16

that that's enough, though, to defeat summary judgment.

18

though perhaps the -- you don't show any bias on the part

19

of the witness.

20

MR. CLEMENT:

A

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, that's

21

not the way I read this Court's decision in Anderson

22

against Liberty Lobby, which seems to suggest that simply

23

the possibility that the jury will not disbelieve

24

testimony even if there's no other evidence that draws

25

that testimony into question --

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

But there is.

2

MR. CLEMENT:

3

QUESTION:

-- it's not enough.

You mentioned Medina, Medina's

4

letter, which says, look, we -- we refused to hire this

5

person because he didn't show -- he didn't show that he

6

was no longer an addict.

7

MR. CLEMENT:

And I think that if the Medina --

8

certainly if Medina were the decision maker or even one of

9

the decision makers in this case --

10
11

QUESTION:

But didn't the company designate him

to put in the response to EEOC?

12
13

MR. CLEMENT:

They certainly did, but the -- the

14

facts of this case are that Bockmiller was the ultimate

15

decision maker.

16

that in these kind of disparate treatment cases, what

17

you're looking for is if --

18

And in Hazen Paper, this Court suggested

QUESTION:

What is the relative position in the

19

company?

20

level employee than Bockmiller.

21

I had the impression that Medina was a higher

MR. CLEMENT:

I think that's correct, Justice

22

Ginsburg, but at the end of the day, he just wasn't the

23

decision maker.

24
25

I think, though, I -- I've made our position
clear, which is when you have a case where there's an

22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

ultimate decision maker who suggests a neutral policy was

2

involved, our position would be a -- a straight statement

3

by somebody who was not involved in -- directly in the

4

decision making process shouldn't preclude summary

5

judgment.

6

I do want to be clear, though, that that really

7

is the less important issue for the -- from the

8

Government's perspective because the Ninth Circuit's

9

decision in this case does embody the position that this

10

kind of neutral policy, assuming it exists for a moment,

11

is somehow per se unlawful as applied to drug addicts.

12

And I think, again as Justice Stevens suggested, there may

13
14

be ways that a plaintiff could try to go after such a

15

neutral policy.

16

a reasonable accommodation theory, a reasonable

17

accommodation must be given.

18

forward, I think an employer would have an opportunity to

19

say, no, that reasonable accommodation imposes an undue

20

hardship.

21

They could suggest that it -- that under

But if that were brought

In similar fashion -- and I would say this.

I

22

think if you look at the statute as a whole, the provision

23

of the statute that most specifically speaks to a neutral

24

qualification criteria that is alleged to have a disparate

25

impact on individuals with a disability is -- is 42 U.S.C.

Well, there's no disparate impact

MR. CLEMENT:

MR. CLEMENT:

No, that was never addressed in

the lower courts.

The Ninth Circuit didn't

QUESTION:

No.

That's what I thought.

So we

don't have to get into that.

14
15

MR. CLEMENT:

You don't have to get in, and we

16

would suggest that you not definitively resolve the

17

reasonable accommodation issue or the disparate impact

18

theory.

19

But that doesn't mean that it's sort of harmless

20

error if the Ninth Circuit opinion stays on the book

21

because the Ninth Circuit assumes that the answer to the

22

question on reasonable accommodation is that you could

23

never justify such a policy.

24

reasonable accommodation.

25

You'd always have to grant a

The Ninth Circuit opinion assumes that there

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would be a disparate impact even when there's not or even

2

if the employer could justify the policy as job-related

3

and consistent with business necessity.

4

I wanted to be responsive to Justice Stevens'

5

question, though, even though I think this Court should

6

ultimately not reach it.

7

accommodation, there's no question that reasonable

8

accommodation applies in the application process.

9

if you have -- for example, if you're going -- an employer

10

wants to give a application test for the job, and puts it

11

in a facility that's not wheelchair accessible, that

12

reasonable accommodation would have to be given, and that

13

would be a reasonable accommodation in the hiring process.

14

With respect to reasonable

And so

I do think, though, that subsection (b)(6)

15
16

addresses very directly a neutral qualification standard

17

that's alleged to screen out an individual with a

18

disability or to tend to screen out an individual with a

19

disability.

20

trigger the employer's burden to come forward and show

21

that the requirement was job-related and consistent with

22

business necessity.

23

And with respect to that claim, that would

One of the real sort of ironies, if you will, of

24

the Ninth Circuit's opinion is on the same page of the

25

opinion and in consecutive footnotes, after they -- they

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

clearly hold that the disparate impact theory is not in

2

this case, they also fault the employer for not justifying

3

the neutral rule as consistent with business necessity.

4

But the business necessity defense, as its status as a

5

defense, suggests is not some sort of free-floating

6

obligation on the employer, especially in a disparate

7

treatment case where the employer has already pointed to a

8

neutral and legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for their

9

actions.

The business necessity defense comes into a case

10

when a plaintiff has properly preserved a claim under

11

subsection (b)(6) and triggers the obligation of the

12

employer to come through.

13

I would like to also point out, though, that we

14

largely agree with Mr. Phillips that there is -- there is

15

much in 42 U.S.C. 12114(c)(4) that suggests that there may

16
17

be a basis for an employer to maintain this kind of

18

neutral policy, and I think an employer may be able to use

19

that section as a defense.

20

I would agree with Justice Stevens that it

21

doesn't speak directly to this situation because all it

22

does is allow -- with respect to current drug users who

23

aren't entitled to any protection under the act, it

24

clarifies that an employer can apply a neutral

25

qualification standard, and it doesn't matter whether the

26
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

underlying misconduct has its roots in -- in drug use or

2

drug addiction.

3

but implicit in that provision is the idea that an

4

employer can use uniform and neutral sanctions for

5

violations of those uniform conduct rules.

And I think it doesn't directly say it,

6

The difficult question becomes whether or not

7

there's something special about a bar on re-employment,

8

when you say that if you violate our conduct rules not

9

only are you terminated, but you need never darken our

10

door again.

11

policy, there are two -- the act, in a sense, points in

12

two different directions.

13

a clear distinction between current drug users who are --

14

who are not protected by the act and draws a distinction

15

between recovered addicts who are protected by the act.

16

In --in any event, the Court can reconcile those competing

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN G. MONTOYA

22

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

23
24
25

MR. MONTOYA:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In the Ninth Circuit's opinion, the court made

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it emphatically clear that there were two predicates for

its decision.

analysis, what Raytheon's intent was upon dismissal.

4

this is all very clear, reprinted at page 12a and 13a of

5

the appendix.

6

quote, presented sufficient evidence from which a jury can

7

conclude -- could conclude that he was qualified for the

8

position he sought in 1994 and that is application was

9

rejected because of his record of drug -- drug addiction.

One was a traditional discriminatory impact
And

The court says that Mr. Hernandez has,

10

Period.

11

of whether or not this alleged uniform practice is, in

12

fact, valid under the Americans with Disability Act.

13

there are two grounds for the decision.

14

Additionally -- and then it goes to the question

So

And moreover, because this could be a mixed

15

motive case, even if this Court concludes that the alleged

16

oral practice is valid, the case would still have to be

17

remanded because you -- even if the employer had a valid

18
19

reason to terminate Mr. Hernandez, if it also had a mixed

20

motive and the other motive was invalid, it was -- he was

21

also terminated and based upon his history of drug and

22

alcohol addiction, the case has to be resolved by a jury.

23

And the question --

24

QUESTION:

25

Mr. Montoya, I'd like to go back to

the opening statement you made because you -- you said

28
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this was a legitimate disparate impact case, but looking

2

on that same page in the footnote, the Ninth Circuit is

3

agreeing with the district court that because Hernandez

4

failed to timely raise disparate impact, this has got to

5

be a disparate treatment case.

6

MR. MONTOYA:

Your Honor, I misspoke.

If I said

7

disparate impact, I meant to say discriminatory intent.

The question of Raytheon's intent.

I won't speculate on that, Your

Honor.

12

But I -- I will say that I disagree with my

13

learned friends representing Raytheon that we admitted

14

that this oral practice was applied to Mr. Hernandez in

15

this case because we don't even think that the practice

16

exists.

17

is because in Raytheon's first official written statement

doesn't mention a practice.

25

It just says there's a right, which is

QUESTION:

But the Ninth -- the Ninth Circuit

again, Mr. Montoya, in footnote 17 simply says there's no

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

question that Hughes applied this policy in rejecting

2

Hernandez's application.

3

MR. MONTOYA:

I know it says that Justice --

4

Chief Justice Rehnquist.

5

meant in that footnote is that there's no question that

6

Raytheon claims that it applied that.

7

the Ninth Circuit was trying to get at was that even if

8

Raytheon's story is true, Raytheon still doesn't

9

necessarily win because Raytheon's alleged practice could

I think what the Ninth Circuit

And I think what

10

be violative of the ADA as applied to Mr. Hernandez in

11

this particular case.

12

intent remains.

13

But the question of discriminatory

Moreover and just as importantly, the question

14

of whether or not this alleged practice exists remains.

15

This is an oral -- this is a right that Raytheon alleged.

16

There's no -- no evidence that this rule was ever applied

17

to anyone else.

18

QUESTION:

We -- we didn't take the case to --

19

to determine whether -- you know, to determine that.

20

mean, I -- the court of appeals proceeded on the

I

21
22

assumption that it did exist, and -- and the reason we

23

have the case is that it is a very important proposition

24

of law, which the Ninth Circuit adopted, that where you

25

have such a policy, it will not be applicable to someone

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

who's a rehabilitated drug addict.

2

MR. MONTOYA:

3

QUESTION:

Yes, that's --

That's the reason we took the case,

4

and you're telling us we can't get to it because --

5

because in fact the Ninth Circuit was just wrong that

6

there was the policy at all.

7
8
9
10

MR. MONTOYA:

That is correct, Your Honor, and I

believe that that is a question of disputed material fact.
QUESTION:

Did -- did you raise this in your --

in your brief in opposition to certiorari?

11

MR. MONTOYA:

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. MONTOYA:

Yes, we did, Your Honor.

That particular question?
Yes, we did.

We believe that the

14

question presented in the petitioner's cert petition is

15

hypothetical because it's contingent upon at least two

16

dispositive material factual disputes, the question of

17

discriminatory intent and the question of whether or not

18

this uniform practice actually exists.

19

QUESTION:

Well, but the Ninth Circuit, I take

20

it, was entitled to proceed on the assumption that the

21

factual determination might turn out as -- as Hughes says

22
23

it is, and it then went on and gave instructions as to how

24

the case ought to be resolved.

25

that if we think it's in error.

And we certainly can reach

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MONTOYA:

Yes, you can.

However, I think

2

that in order to reach that, you have to make a factual

3

assumption that might be incorrect, and I think that it

4

would be premature for the Court to render that assumption

5

or to make that assumption at this juncture because it

6

could be that if this case were remanded to the trial

7

court, jury instructions would render that aspect of this

8

Court's opinion moot.

9

affirmatively whether or not --

10

QUESTION:

For example, a jury could answer

Did the court of appeals exceed its

11

authority under Article III in making the statements it --

12

it did with respect to the lawfulness of the termination

13

policy?

14

MR. MONTOYA:

Your Honor, I think that it -- it

15

certainly reached the borders of Article III.

16

declaratory judgment action could have been filed --

17

QUESTION:

22

it would be binding.

Well, it would depend upon the

If the assumed facts were identical, then perhaps
However, those facts are clearly

23
24
25

assumptions in this particular case.
QUESTION:

Well, if -- if facts might be proven

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

from the record, courts of appeals routinely give

2

directions to the trial courts as to how the law is to be

3

applied, don't they?

4

MR. MONTOYA:

That's true, Your Honor.

However,

5

that makes this case much less worthy of this Court's

6

consideration at this juncture because even though the

7

Ninth Circuit is perhaps closer to the district court and

8

has more judicial resources to resolve those types of

9

declaratory questions, those questions might, once again,

10

be rendered moot in this particular case if the jury

11

concludes that there was no oral practice and that in fact

12

it was made up, or if the jury concludes that

13

notwithstanding any oral practice --

14

QUESTION:

Well, that's all right, but we would

MR. MONTOYA:

Well, they -- they didn't get to

Well, but surely, if they had meant

the -- the part of the -- the part of the act that

requires accommodation, they would have said so.

MR. MONTOYA:

QUESTION:

6
7

Well --

I mean, you're really kind of

rewriting the court of appeals' opinion, it seems to me.
MR. MONTOYA:

Well, Your Honor, I don't know

8

whether you'd call it a reasonable accommodation or a

9

relaxation of the qualification requirement because the --

10

the ADA, under 12112(b)(6), does apply to qualification

11

standards, employment tests, or other selection criteria

12

that screen out or tend to screen out an individual with a

disability or a class of individuals.

MR. MONTOYA:

definition of disability set forth by the ADA, Justice

Scalia, someone with a record of a disability is in fact

disabled under the statute.

QUESTION:

He is in fact disabled, but -- but

what -- what disability of his are you accommodating?
MR. MONTOYA:

His former -- you're relaxing a

8

qualification standard that would -- that would hinder the

9

entrance of a reformed alcoholic who was disabled under

10

the statute into the job market, which is the purpose of

11

the ADA, not to segregate disabled individuals who can

12

work from the job market.

he's not disabled.

MR. MONTOYA:

It doesn't fit.

accommodation analysis.

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. MONTOYA:

No.
However, it does fit into the

24

statute, to the language of the statute, 12(b)(6), those

25

qualification standards that screen out.

Under the ADA,

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

those have to be relaxed.

of those standards reasonable accommodation or whether you

call it something else, substantively it's the same thing.

4

It is an accommodation of a qualification standard or a

5

relaxation of a qualification standard based upon a

6

particularized inquiry regarding an individual applicant.

7

That's what the ADA expressly demands in the language of

8

the statute itself, and that's what the Ninth Circuit was

And that's what the Solicitor General

says is not really presented in this case, though.

MR. MONTOYA:

Well, it's hard to say that it's

Ninth Circuit addressed that very issue.

Well, it didn't cite 112, but it

-- it -QUESTION:

They didn't cite it, and they said

it's not a disparate impact case, too.
MR. MONTOYA:

And I -- I think what the Ninth

23

Circuit meant by that, Justice Stevens, is that we're not

24

talking about a class of individuals treated disparately.

25

We're talking about one individual who was treated

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

discriminatorily.

2

And the ADA also --

QUESTION:

He's only discriminatorily treated

because he's a member of a -- of a specially defined

4

class, namely, reformed alcoholics and -- and drug-

5

addicted persons.

7
8

That for that record makes him a
He's kind of in a unique class.

The -- the court of appeals really did not focus
on this part of the case.

9

MR. MONTOYA:

Well, Your Honor, even though

10

there's that language regarding disparate impact, it

11

nevertheless ruled the way it did and said that this --

12

and -- and in fact, the -- the Ninth Circuit --

13

QUESTION:

But the ruling that it adopted, as I

14

understand the statute, really deprived the employer of an

15

opportunity to -- to set forth any of the affirmative

16

defenses that would be available, business necessity, and

17

so forth.

18

MR. MONTOYA:

Well, Your Honor, the employer had

19

the ability to assert those affirmative defenses in its

20

complaint in the district court, which is part of the

21

record in this case, and it did not.

22

business necessity, direct threat, all of those --

23

QUESTION:

Undue hardship,

They don't need to assert those

24

defenses if someone was claiming a failure to accommodate,

25

and if that was not what was before the house, they'd have

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

no incentive to do that.

2

MR. MONTOYA:

Well, clearly, Justice Scalia, Mr.

3

Hernandez was challenging this rule that screened him out,

4

and if in fact --

5

QUESTION:

But why do we even get to that?

This

6

is -- this case is so puzzling on -- for many reasons, but

7

one thing is Medina or Medina said he didn't come up with

8

one shred of proof that he's no longer an addict, and we

9

are permitted -- being an addict is not a disability

10

within the ADA, being an addict.

11

is.

13

from Alcohol Anonymous.

14

longer an alcoholic, but there's not one thing here that

15

says he's no longer addicted to cocaine.

16

I don't -- I didn't find anything either that said that.

17

Being a reformed addict

So said this employer, look, he sent a letter -- he

MR. MONTOYA:

He sent a letter

Maybe that shows that he's no

And there -- and

Well -- well, Your Honor, I think

18

that if you construe the facts and the inferences in Mr.

19

Hernandez's favor, as you must, Mr. John Lyman's letter,

20

who is the AA sponsor, says that he is in recovery from

21

addiction.

22

Hernandez's favor on a motion for summary judgment, I

23

think that that would also include his addiction from

24

other substances as well.

25

And if you construe the inferences in Mr.

QUESTION:

Even though this is -- this is solely

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

from someone who knows him from the alcohol program.

2

Isn't the most logical assumption if he's got a letter

3

from an AA counselor, that what they're talking about is

4

alcohol addiction?

5

MR. MONTOYA:

Yes, Your Honor.

However, because

6

AA offers a rehabilitation program for any type of alcohol

7

or substance abuse, I don't think it would really matter

8

in this case if you construe the facts and the inferences

9

in favor of Mr. Hernandez, as you must, because he was the

10

non-moving party in the context of a motion for summary

11

judgment.

12

QUESTION:

The inference you want us to construe

13

in his favor is that alcohol means things other than

14

alcohol.

Is that --

15

MR. MONTOYA:

16

QUESTION:

17

Well -- well --

Is that a favorable inference, or is

it a wild leap into the -- into the dark?

18

MR. MONTOYA:

I -- I don't think it's a wild

19

leap into the dark, and I think it's supported by the text

20

of Mr. John Lyman's letter.

21
22
23

QUESTION:

Where is that letter so we can

look -MR. MONTOYA:

It is appendix 14a, Justice

24

Ginsburg, and it says, Joel attends AA regularly,

25

participates in discussion when appropriate, and is

MR. MONTOYA:

25

That is true, Justice Ginsburg.

And it says he's -- he's committed to

this program, demonstrates his willingness to accept

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

responsibility for his recovery.

2

MR. MONTOYA:

But this letter -- this letter is

3

unequivocal that he was in recovery.

4

unequivocal that he was maintaining his sobriety, and I --

5

and I contend that it is reasonable to believe that

6

there's more than -- alcohol is just one form of drug, and

7

alcohol is a drug that impacts sobriety.

8

drugs that impact sobriety, and cocaine impacts sobriety.

9

I think that the clear import of this letter is that he is

This letter is

There are other

10

clean and sober in all respects and is taking

11

responsibility for his recovery in all respects.

12

And the point that Justice Ginsburg brings up is

13

not a point that the trial court gave any credence to.

14

It's not a point that the court of appeals gave any

15

credence to.

16

I would contend should be presented to the jury.

17

and that's especially true in this case because Raytheon

18

claims --

19

And that is really the type of argument that

And --

Whether or not summary judgment

20

should be granted is a question of law, not -- not a

21

question of fact.

22

in -- in every court that's considering it I think.

23

And so the same arguments can be made

MR. MONTOYA:

That is -- that is correct.

24

However, depending upon the weight of the evidence,

25

some --

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

2

QUESTION:

The weight of the evidence has

nothing to do with summary judgment.

3

MR. MONTOYA:

Well -- well, if -- if there's a

4

factual dispute, Justice Rehnquist, then the summary

5

judgment is no longer -- then summary judgment is no

6

longer appropriate.

7

What I perhaps should have stated is that this

8

-- this letter renders summary judgment inappropriate in

9

reference to the question of whether or not Mr. Hernandez

10

is maintaining his recovery.

11

QUESTION:

I thought you were going to say that

12

the -- what the plaintiff claimed is a witness.

13

plaintiff says, I've had this whatever the -- the moment

14

was.

15

I woke up one day and said no more and ever since then

16

I've been clean.

17

that was the only proof.

18

convincing, but it was a statement --

19

The

I reached rock bottom or whatever you called it, and

So the -- so the -- the plaintiff did --

MR. MONTOYA:

That might not be very

That -- that is true.

That is

20

part of the record.

21

that is unrebutted below.

22

did Raytheon ever question Mr. Hernandez's rehabilitation.

23

On July 4th of 1992 in his affidavit, Mr. Hernandez said

24

that he embraced Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior and

25

foreswear drugs and alcohol.

And moreover and more importantly,
At no time in this proceedings

That is in his affidavit.

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

That is unrefuted.

2

And more important -- and just as importantly,

3

Raytheon didn't subject him to an IME.

4

hey, you say you're -- you're rehabilitated?

5

Let's send you to a physician to let him ascertain that.

6

The question of rehabilitation is in fact a question of

indicating that Raytheon believed that he was still

Mr. --

And not only does Raytheon say that once in a

QUESTION:

Of course, if he's still addicted,

then he's not protected by the act.

8

MR. MONTOYA:

9

that they believe he's addicted.

Well, they -- it's a false belief
And -- and if he's

10

regarded as taking drugs and alcohol and is -- and is

11

disabled as a result of that addiction, then he is

12

regarded as disabled under the act, which is exactly what

13

Raytheon said in writing in its first official statement

14

regarding this case.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Montoya, in your -- you say now

16

that you question the existence of such a rule, and yet

17

you've had an opportunity for discovery in the district

whatever other reasons?

23

I -- I don't see that you ever asked any

MR. MONTOYA:

Do you

You never, never tested the rule.
Your Honor, the rule was tested in

24

the context of the deposition examination of the only two

25

witnesses that Raytheon produced who testified about the

Bockmiller and Medina.

2

And, first of all, no one knew the genesis of

3

the rule where -- or -- or not -- they didn't even

4

describe it as a rule.

5

it as a practice, and they didn't know the origin of the

6

practice.

7

They didn't know why it hadn't been written down.

In the depositions, they described

They didn't know how often it had been applied.

8

And moreover and -- and very importantly, this

9

oral practice contradicted Raytheon's written practices.

10

For example, under Raytheon's written rules, a temporary

11

employee who tests positive for drugs and alcohol, quote,

12

will have their assignment terminated and will not be

13

eligible for assignment or for regular employment for the

14

succeeding 12 months.

is actually contrary to its alleged oral practice, which

impeaches the testimony regarding the existence of the

That's true, Justice Ginsburg.

6

However, that's a two-edged sword.

7

adduce any evidence of its application to any other

8

individual and that would actually be Raytheon's burden.

9

If we, as the Ninth Circuit concluded, established a prima

10

facie case, then it's Raytheon's duty to rebut that prima

11

facie case with some form of evidence.

12

that Raytheon produced in reference to this oral practice

13

was the testimony of Bockmiller and Medina, and they

14

didn't adduce any applications of this rule either.

not only a question of reasonable accommodation, it's also

a question of whether or not he's the most qualified.

It's also a question of whether or not he constitutes a
