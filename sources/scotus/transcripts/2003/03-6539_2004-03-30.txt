CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

We'll hear argument

now in No. 03-6539, Jay Shawn Johnson v. California.

5

Mr. Bedrick.

6

ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. BEDRICK:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

I would like to address three points.

11

First, the correct prima facie standard under

12

Batson is whether there is sufficient evidence to permit a

13

reasonable judge to infer discrimination.

14

threshold is too high and incorrectly conflates step one

15

and step three of Batson analysis.

16

QUESTION:

The California

Well now, Mr. Bedrick, are -- are you

17

talking about enough evidence, say, to -- for a trial

18

judge to let a case go to a jury or enough evidence to

19

persuade a trial judge who's sitting as the finder of

20

fact?

21

I think those are two different things.
MR. BEDRICK:

I would say the former rather than

22

the latter, Your Honor.

23

evidence to permit a reasonable trial judge to infer that

24

there was racial discrimination in jury selection.

25

QUESTION:

I'm suggesting sufficient

So it -- it doesn't have to be proven

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

by a preponderance of the evidence.

2

MR. BEDRICK:

Absolutely not.

California uses a

3

standard of preponderance of the evidence and we believe

4

that is substantially higher than that which the -- the

5

standard which this Court suggested in Batson and in

6

Purkett v. Elem and in Hernandez v. New York.

7

standard is substantially higher than used by anywhere

8

else in the country.

9

QUESTION:

This

What's the best analog that you have?

10

Probable cause doesn't seem to fit.

11

reasonable grounds for belief.

12

which tell us what little semantic formulation you want to

13

use?

14

MR. BEDRICK:

Reasonable suspicion,

Are -- are there cases

That's a good question.

In

15

discussion with associates, we thrashed that around.

16

Probable cause is much too high.

17

which is lower than probable cause, starts to get near it,

18

but I know the Court had a reasonable suspicion case last

19

week and I don't know all the intricacies of it.

20

is somewhat -­

21

QUESTION:

Reasonable suspicion,

My sense

Well, that's -- that's not the

22

standard for letting a case go to the jury, though.

It

23

seems to me that if that's what you're appealing to, what

24

the test ought to be is not whether the judge thinks it's

25

more likely than not, but whether a reasonable jury could

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

think that it's more likely than not.

Surely that's the

2

standard for letting a case go to the jury, not a

3

suspicion.

You know, if the judge thinks --

4

MR. BEDRICK:

5

QUESTION:

No.

-- he has to say a reasonable juror

6

could find that it is more likely than not that the

7

plaintiff's case is -- is sustainable.

8

test for going to the jury?

9

MR. BEDRICK:

Isn't that the

When the test goes to the jury,

10

the plaintiff has the burden of proving his case by a

11

preponderance of the evidence.

12

QUESTION:

13

The jury has to find it by a

preponderance.

14

MR. BEDRICK:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.

But in order to let it go to the

16

jury, I had always thought that the criterion was not

17

whether the judge thought it was more likely than not but

18

whether in his view a reasonable jury could think it more

19

likely than not.

20

MR. BEDRICK:

I think that is close to the test

21

that I'm asking for, Your Honor.

22

QUESTION:

Okay.

23

QUESTION:

You had a model -­

24

QUESTION:

Of course, that standard applies

25

after the -- after the case has been -- has been tried and

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

-- and both sides have had an opportunity be heard.

2

-- all you're asking for is the opportunity to make

3

inquiry.

4

MR. BEDRICK:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

All

All we're

5

asking is that prosecutor be -- or the -- or the

6

challenger, whoever that may be, be asked the reason.

7

what we are ask -- our standard is somewhat closer to a

8

discovery standard.

9

QUESTION:

You're asking more than that.

You're

10

asking under our law that if the -- if the prosecutor

11

doesn't come back with a reason, you win.

12

MR. BEDRICK:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. BEDRICK:

15

So

Absolutely not, Your Honor.

You're not?
I respectfully disagree.

The

series -­

16

QUESTION:

The -- the prosecutor can stand

17

silent and -- and -- and the -- the judge can still find

18

against you.

19

MR. BEDRICK:

Very much so because the -- the

20

series of cases from this Court, the Batson-Hernandez-

21

Elem trilogy, and -- and also the -- some of the Title VII

22

cases provide that even though the burden of producing

23

evidence shifts, the burden of persuasion never shifts.

24

So -­

25

QUESTION:

But the persuasion burden would be

2

facie case.

3

where you've made the prima facie showing.

4

necessarily win if the defendant comes up with a

5

nondiscriminatory reason.

6

stands silent -- you've made your prima facie case.

7

Defendant says nothing.

8
9

The Title VII cases deal with a situation

MR. BEDRICK:

You don't

But if the defendant just

Don't you win at that point?
No, Your Honor, I do not win

either under Batson or under Title VII.

This Court

10

decided a couple of cases, including Reeves and St. Mary's

11

Honor Center in which the finding was a prima facie case

12

was made, the employer gave a reason, the trial judge said

13

I disbelieve that reason -­

14
15

QUESTION:

Yes, of course, but suppose the

employer gives no reason.

16

MR. BEDRICK:

17

QUESTION:

Suppose that the prosecutor stands

18

silent.

I don't -­

Those are all cases where the prosecutor does

MR. BEDRICK:

But if no reason is

23

we have never come across a case -- there may be one.

24

have never come across one where the prosecutor stood

25

silent.

The prosecutor always has a reason.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

Well, you -- you were asked to

2

consider what -- what does it mean, this prima facie case,

3

if the defendant does stand silent.

4

that the prosecutor would or a defendant would in Title

5

VII.

6

MR. BEDRICK:

It may be implausible

Yes, but even so, even -- even in

7

this theoretical and I think inconceivable hypothetical

8

situation, if the challenger stood silent, the trial judge

9

still has to determine whether or not the objector has

10

proven discrimination at that point, at stage three, by a

11

preponderance of the evidence.

12

QUESTION:

I -- I suggest that the reason you've

13

never come across a case in which the prosecutor stands

14

silent is because the prosecutors know that if they stand

15

silent, they lose.

16

MR. BEDRICK:

17

QUESTION:

No.

The prosecutor -­

It's not at all inconceivable.

I

18

mean, that -- that's why they always come up with a reason

19

because, as I understand the way we formulated our -- our

20

Title VII test, you -- you have to come up with an excuse,

21

and if you don't have an excuse, the plaintiff wins.

22

-- I'm not sure I agree with that, but that's what our law

23

is.

24
25

MR. BEDRICK:

I'm

The prosecutor knows that he will

look bad if he does not come up with a reason.

But our prosecutors are

So in this case -- and even there are many

7

cases.

In the many cases where the question of prima

8

facie case is being discussed and it looks like it's a

9

close case, in many of those, a careful prosecutor will

facie level.

I would like to tell you what

What -- what would you do with

Would that be a prima facie case or not?
MR. BEDRICK:

With one juror challenged, six

23

remain, from the defense perspective, I would say I have a

24

very lousy -- lousy chance of making a prima facie case,

25

and I would not make that argument.

Perhaps he

I'm -- I'm positing a case in which

7

for reasons beyond the control of the prosecutor, they

can't tell what the real reason was of the man who

conducted the voir dire.

10

MR. BEDRICK:

At that point I would suggest that

MR. BEDRICK:

QUESTION:

6

If -­

The only prospective black juror was

struck.

7

MR. BEDRICK:

That is why we are arguing here

8

for this -- for the threshold that we are arguing for,

9

which is a relatively -- relatively low threshold at which

10

the trial judge examines all the circumstances and, when

11

in doubt, rules that there should be a prima facie case,

12

and then we get an answer, and then the trial judge makes

13

a decision based on an answer, and then we get a record.

14

QUESTION:

Why do you say when in doubt?

I

15

mean, isn't it enough to say the trial judge has to -- can

16

find that there's a prima facie case of discrimination,

17

but why slant it one way or the other?

18

MR. BEDRICK:

Because in response to the last

19

question, I was trying to show that one of the things that

20

are missing when a -- when the questions are not asked of

21

the challenger is a record.

answer would be, and that puts the appellate court in a

11

there may be something going on here.

12

under California procedure do you think you should make

the objection?

14

does that work?

How

I would say it depends on the

discretion of the objecting party.

If there was only one

then defense counsel might make the challenge at the time

MR. BEDRICK:

there are exceptions under our Cox case, and I've looked

at them.

No.

But may I ask on the finality

final with respect to the disposition of the Batson claim?

Is the decision of the California Supreme Court

It very much is, Your Honor.

QUESTION:

There's nothing more to be decided

relevant to that issue.

3

MR. BEDRICK:

Absolutely not.

4

So that what I was hoping to argue to the Court

5

was we have a very distinct and sharp conflict between the

6

State of California and the Ninth Circuit and, indeed,

7

between the State of California and the rest of the

8

country on several of these issues.

9

QUESTION:

What is the -­

May I ask you one question that is

10

relevant to that?

11

understand it, is taking the position each State is free

12

to implement Batson as it chooses, and California points

13

out that it has a standard that's more stringent than the

14

Federal standard on disqualifying a juror for race bias.

15

The California standard is significant likelihood that the

16

juror is biased, where the Federal standard is a

17

reasonable possibility.

18

a more stringent standard on disqualifying a juror for

19

race bias, why can't we have a more stringent standard on

20

Batson.

21

And that is, that California, as I

MR. BEDRICK:

So California says if we can have

Batson.

2

QUESTION:

I thought part of that was that

3

Batson leaves room for the States.

It doesn't require

4

every State to -- to handle Batson challenges the same

5

way.

I think that is an argument that California made.

6

MR. BEDRICK:

There are -- there -- there are

7

some -- I'm not sure what aspects were left to the States,

8

but California's Supreme Court did not -- the State makes

9

this argument, but the California Supreme Court did not.

10

The California Supreme Court did not say anything

11

addressing any independent State ground.

12
13
14

QUESTION:

More a question for the State than

for you.
I -- I can't really think of an analog here.

15

Our search and seizure jurisprudence, our arrest

16

jurisprudence, our Miranda jurisprudence is all uniform.

17

Here, of course, State jury selection procedures vary, and

18

so there has to be some allowance for that.

19

hand, I'm not sure what the State is going to tell me so

20

far as a helpful analog for having a different -­

21

different rule.

22

MR. BEDRICK:

On the other

The best standard we could come up

23

with, Your Honor, was something that was similar to the

24

standard on a Federal civil procedure 12(b)(6) motion.

25

a motion to dismiss, could a reasonable trial -- could a

QUESTION:

You're not talking about a motion to dismiss a

7

MR. BEDRICK:

That -- that's what 12(b)(6) would

8

be, Your Honor.

So the question is can the plaintiff get

9

out -- can the plaintiff get out of the batter's box.

So

10

that that is -- that is the type of language that -- that

11

we are seeing in the Federal courts interpreting the raise

12

in inference.

13

That's also what we are -- in Title VII context

we're actually seeing a lower threshold.

16

that he was part of -- of a protected group, that he was

qualified for a job, that he applied, that he was

rejected, and the employer is still looking.

19

QUESTION:

In Title VII, to

But you -- you do have some

20

difference on a motion to dismiss because the rule is that

21

if any conceivable allegations could have been proved in

support of what the complaint says, it shouldn't be

dismissed.

24

I think it's a little more stringent.

But at the close of the plaintiff's evidence,

MR. BEDRICK:

I -- I guess I'm persuaded that we

are somewhat higher than rule 12(b)(6).

I think we're

also somewhat lower than reasonable suspicion.

think this standard comes up in many other kinds of

motions where ordinary civil procedure motions where a

subject of what sort of a standard should apply in that

MR. BEDRICK:

But it -- it could turn out to be

21

appealable.

The chances of them showing prejudice are

22

limited, but it's the same kind of situation.

plaintiff here is trying to obtain some evidence, and here

it's actually the crucial evidence so that in my discovery

But I suppose the prosecutor is.

MR. BEDRICK:

The prosecutor is, and then the

that there is something wrong with that answer which

therefore shows prejudice.

said I challenge this juror because in voir dire, the

QUESTION:

MR. BEDRICK:

When this Court considered Batson,

the argument made by the State is we have a peremptory

shouldn't just brush it aside.

And this Court decided in

Batson, yes, peremptory challenge statutes are important,

but the Equal Protection Clause and the U.S. Constitution

12

are even more important, and as in the conflict between

those two, the Equal Protection Clause, which is

preventing racial discrimination, which is protecting the

rights of the individual jurors not to be discriminated,

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT
MR. SCHALIT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The more likely than not standard identified by

19

interest in using peremptory challenges to select a

qualified and unbiased jury.

guess, that argument and -- and with the California

position is this.

I assume that under Batson when and if

10

the time comes for the prosecutor to make a response, we

11

want a -- a context in -- in which the prosecutor at least

12

has got a fair shake to -- to persuade the court.

13

the California system, which you're defending, the judge

14

does not, in effect, ask the prosecutor for a response

15

until the judge, in effect, has already found against him

16

on the merits because on your view, the prosecutor has

said implicitly, by a preponderance of the evidence, they

MR. SCHALIT:

In the -- in the Batson setting,

5

in the Title VII cases, in any case in which there is a

6

prima facie case found, going back to Kelly v. Peters with

7

Justice Story, there is such evidence that unless

rebutted, the party with the burden of persuasion will

prevail.

QUESTION:

That is true if you've got a

12

the plaintiff shows the McDonnell Douglas factors and the

at that point, plaintiff wins because there's a reasonable

Every time there's a challenge in a Batson setting, the

There can't be those four elements.

The -- the reference in Batson to the Title VII

create the prima facie case.

that is helpful in a case in which there's a run of the

that is presumed, more likely than not, follows from the

MR. SCHALIT:

The -- the first step perhaps

could be, but at some point there's going to need to be

most likely further proceedings or to then go back and

25

determine whether those reasons are pretextual.

this Court has already rejected in the voir dire context.

16

It maintains the proper balance between the anti­

17

discrimination goals of the Equal Protection Clause and

18

the peremptory challenge system what this Court -- which

19

this Court has repeatedly recognized plays an important

20

function in serving the selection of a fair and qualified

21

jury.

It avoids using an inference standard that does

The judgment should, therefore, be affirmed.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN B. BEDRICK

3

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

4

MR. BEDRICK:

Thank you, Your Honor.

In this case, the prosecutor preempted all three

African American jurors, leaving a black defendant to be

7

tried before an all-white jury in a case that had racial

8

issues.

9

facie case.

If this Court -- this is a paradigm of a prima
This is a much stronger prima facie case than

10

that which is required in virtually all of the Federal

11

courts.

12

If this Court does not reach this question

13

because it finds something that still is alive below, I

14

respectfully submit that this Court would be sending a

15

very poor message to the State courts and a very poor

16

message to the Federal courts, namely, that yes, it is

17

technically in error but it's not important enough for us

18

to decide.

I'd respectfully ask the Court to reach this

In terms of what would happen if the States -­

21

at the State court, I don't think I -- I could never get

22

counsel, on the Batson issue we'd like to rule for you but

You'd have a decision from the

You could come here from that.

So will you.

MR. BEDRICK:

3

QUESTION:

Yes.

Well, and importantly, we know what

the California Supreme Court's final word is on it

already.

MR. BEDRICK:

We don't know.

moving in the direction of denying the opportunity to show

16

whether or not there's discrimination.

They may

We don't know what they're

If the California court's standard of

preponderance of the evidence is allowed to apply, we

believe that will eviscerate Batson because that means you

MR. BEDRICK:

2

QUESTION:

3

That is possibly true.

It's definitely true.

Hasn't the

Ninth Circuit disagreed with the California Supreme Court?

4

MR. BEDRICK:

Yes, and we have this continuing

5

battle where counsel is required to spend and waste

6

enormous amounts of time going back and forth and back and

7

forth.

8

I'd sort of ask the Court --

I mean, I guess this case could become my career.

9

(Laughter.)

10

MR. BEDRICK:

-- to let me go on and -- I want

11

to represent my client, but I'd ask the Court to let me go

12

and do something else.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. BEDRICK:

In conclusion, I would ask to

15

point out to the Court that obtaining the reason is the

16

most important thing we're asking here.

Most of the time it will solve the problem.

It's very simple.
