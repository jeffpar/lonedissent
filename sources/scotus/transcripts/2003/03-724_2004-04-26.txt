ORAL ARGUMENT OF STEPHEN M. SHAPIRO

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. SHAPIRO: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:

10

The United States, joined by seven other

11

nations, has concluded that the decision in this case is

12

an error and should be reversed.

13

plaintiffs here are foreign claimants which allege that

14

they paid too much for vitamins outside of U.S. commerce.

15

Trying these claims in our courts would conflict with the

16

principle that the Sherman Act does not regulate the

17

competitive conditions of other nations' economies, and

18

stretching the antitrust laws to include such claims is a

19

recipe for international discord and for heavy new burdens

20

on our Federal district courts.

21

The reason is that the

Now, when Congress passed the FTAIA in 1982, it

22

did not expand the domain of the antitrust laws, but

23

rather clarified limitations.

24

on U.S. commerce and the claim arising from that same

25

effect.

It required both an effect

As the Government explains, this is language that

3
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

refers most naturally to a claim of the plaintiff before

2

the court, and not a claim of some other person.

3

court of appeals, of course, believed that it was enough

4

for somebody else to have a claim arising from a U.S.

5

effect.

6

The

QUESTION: Did -- did the court of appeals

7

explain how that issue would be litigated or decided

8

whether someone else had a claim?

9

MR. SHAPIRO: It really had -- had no explanation

10

of that, Your Honor, and it's quite an extraordinary

11

assumption that you would inquire into the bona fides of

12

some unknown person whether they have a claim or not, and

13

indeed, there is a case pending before this Court, the

14

Sniado case, where the litigants have no idea whether

15

there's another person who has such a claim in the United

16

States, and yet discovery has to take place on that -­

17

that issue.

18

QUESTION: The -- the respondent says in -- in

19

its brief without much detail, just makes the allegation,

20

well, it's the single market, this is the nation, this is

21

a global market, so there's nothing you can do.

22

does seem to me that there would be difficulties in -- in

23

defining what is the foreign commerce affecting the United

24

States and what is foreign commerce that does not.

25

this resolved in your -- best resolved in your view?

It -- it

How is

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, in our opinion, the

2

characterization of the market and the scope of the

3

conspiracy is irrelevant to the reach of the antitrust

4

laws.

5

commerce of the United States.

6

explicitly says commerce within the United States, among

7

our states, and with foreign nations.

8

our commerce too.

9

was attempting to regulate commerce in other nations or

10

between other nations with this extraordinary remedy of

11

treble damages.

12

Their -- their domain is defined in terms of the
Both the Sherman Act

The FTAIA refers to

There was no indication that Congress

QUESTION: I -- I guess my point is, is it -- is

13

it all that clear in the real world that these are

14

discrete concepts?

15

MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, Congress had in mind that -­

16

that this would be a bright line test whether or not our

17

commerce was injured, defined as commerce that's domestic

18

or import or export, and it distinguished that from wholly

19

foreign transactions, wholly foreign commerce, and it

20

wanted to draw that line so that these cases would be

21

allocated to the correct judicial system in the world

22

community and they would not all be -­

23

QUESTION: The -- the claim here is that because

24

of the -- because of the worldwide nature of the market,

25

our foreign commerce is necessarily injured, because the

5
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

market being worldwide, if a lower charge had been

2

assessed in the United States, which would have been the

3

case absent the alleged violations of the antitrust laws,

4

there would have been arbitrage, and we would have

5

exported some of these drugs abroad by reason of the fact

6

that they had been purchased at lower prices in the United

7

States.

8

foreign commerce?

9

Why -- why doesn't that make out an injury to

MR. SHAPIRO: It -- it makes out an injury to

10

wholly foreign commerce.

11

Australia, Ecuador, Panama, and the Ukraine, and it isn't

12

enough to say there's some interrelationship among these

13

prices.

14

as a matter of law.

15
16

The overcharge took place in

The Fifth Circuit correctly rejected that claim

QUESTION: No, but there -- there was an
overcharge in the United States.

You're -- you're not -­

17
18

MR. SHAPIRO: Right.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. SHAPIRO: At all -­

21

QUESTION:

22
23

-- contesting that -- that -­

-- that the conspiracy included the

United States?
MR. SHAPIRO: All of the people who were

24

overcharged in the United States have been compensated in

25

the settlement and our fines here have been geared to the

6
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

overcharge -­

2

QUESTION: Yes, but I'm talking about the effect

3

on foreign commerce.

4

in the United States, if realistic market-based prices had

5

been charged in the United States, we would have re­

6

exported a lot of these drugs to foreign countries that

7

were still being overcharged, wouldn't we?

8
9

If there had not been the overcharge

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, if -- if the
FTAIA was interpreted to permit that argument, the

10

consequences, all of the foreign claimants could come to

11

our courts, our courts would be flooded, other nations

12

would be antagonized, because they believe that they

13

should be able to apply their law to those foreign

14

transactions.

15

relationships among prices in these two systems, because

16

the statute requires a line to be drawn between effect in

17

the United States -­

18
19

QUESTION: Mr. Shapiro, can I ask you a question
-­

20
21

It isn't enough to speculate about

MR. SHAPIRO:

-- and effects, purely foreign

commerce.

22

QUESTION:

-- about your theory, about your

23

theory?

What if the plaintiff is engaged in business in

24

both the United States and in a foreign market and suffers

25

injuries in both?

May he recover for both injuries or

7
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

only the injury in the United States in your view?

2

MR. SHAPIRO: Only for injury in the United

3

States, and the House report talks about that, companies

4

that are involved in jurisdictions -­

5
6

QUESTION: And it -- would that have been the
case before this statute was passed, do you think?

7

MR. SHAPIRO: Yes, I -- I do, because the -- the

8

Clayton Act limits the private treble damage action to

9

injuries stemming from a restraint on U.S. commerce,

10

commerce among the states, and with foreign nations, not

11

commerce that is wholly in foreign nations or between

12

foreign nations.

13

makes the conduct illegal, which is the U.S. restraint.

14

The injury has to flow from that which

QUESTION: No.

The injury in the -- under the

15

statutory language, they has to -- the plaintiff has to

16

suffer an injury to his business or property, but you say

17

that does not include the business or property that's

18

conducted abroad?

19

MR. SHAPIRO: That's correct, because if -- if

20

the -- if the United States claimant has participated

21

overseas in purely foreign commerce, Congress expected

22

that that plaintiff would invoke the laws of the other

23

nation.

24

commerce, Congress expected that the plaintiff would come

25

to our courts.

To the extent that it participated in U.S.

It was a division of judicial labors among

8
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

the sovereign nations to try to encourage other nations to

2

adopt their own antitrust laws and to avoid the kind of

3

antagonism that we see with these amicus briefs from other

4

countries.

5

QUESTION: Do you think that -- do you think

6

maintaining that position is necessary for you to prevail

7

in this case?

8
9

MR. SHAPIRO: Well -- well, of course not, Your
Honor, because the plaintiffs here -- we're talking about

10

the Winddridge Pig Farm in -- in -- as one of the

11

plaintiffs in Australia that's claiming it paid too much

12

for vitamins in Australia, and the other countries wonder

13

why -- why are they complaining about the price of

14

vitamins in the United States court?

15

foreign transaction -­

16

It's a purely

QUESTION: Suppose they -- suppose these foreign

17

buyers had alleged, well, they heard that the United

18

States is a good place to buy things and they tried to buy

19

the vitamins in the United States and found the same

20

rigged prices?

21

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, first, the

22

complaint does not allege any attempt to deal in the

23

United States.

24
25

QUESTION: I'm asking you if that would do under
your theory.

They said, we really wanted to make these

9
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1
2

purchases in the United States.
MR. SHAPIRO: There -- there is one case that I

3

would refer Your Honor to.

4

Trading case, 1981 decision from the Tenth Circuit that

5

says it's not enough to say we might have done something

6

different, we could have done something different, we wish

7

we had done something different.

8

trading pattern.

9

It's the Amex v. Montreal

There has to be a

QUESTION: Suppose they show that they in fact

10

attempted to buy drugs here and they found -- vitamins

11

here -- and they found that the price was the same.

12

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, the Tenth Circuit held that

13

there had to be an interrupted course of trading before a

14

plaintiff could make that allegation, and that's very

15

similar to what this Court held in Holmes v. SIPC -­

16

QUESTION: Mr. Shapiro, I -­

17

MR. SHAPIRO:

18
19

-- that you have to have an actual

transaction that's been interrupted.
QUESTION: I would think your defense against

20

that is -- is -- is not to assert that there's no effect

21

on -- on foreign commerce, on our exports, because I think

22

-- I think there is.

23

defense is -- is in -- in Section 2 of the Foreign Trade

24

Antitrust Improvements Act, which requires that this

25

effect on commerce, on export commerce, gives rise to a

I -- I would -- I would think your

10
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

claim under the provisions of Sections 1 to 7, and -- and

2

the only way it gives rise to a claim on the part of these

3

people is a claim as second purchasers, and Illinois Brick

4

would have excluded their claim, I assume, if they are re­

5

buying from the -- the -- from people in the United

6

States.

7

Wouldn't that be the case?
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, yes, we do rely on the second

8

prong of the FTAIA, which requires that the particular

9

claim derive from an anti-competitive effect in the U.S.

10

And here it doesn't, it derives from an effect overseas,

11

and of course, these plaintiffs don't allege that they

12

purchased some export coming from the United States.

13

QUESTION: No, they -- they're alleging that they

14

would have purchased from -- from Americans.

15

have been down the stream, it seems to me.

16

That would

MR. SHAPIRO: It certainly would be, and it would

17

be extremely speculative, and it's the sort of claim this

18

Court has always rejected under Holmes against SIPC, under

19

Blue Chip Stamps, in the securities context, which has

20

been followed in the antitrust case law.

21

to say we might have done something different. That does

22

not make them into participants in U.S. commerce, and

23

Congress wanted the treble damage remedy to be available

24

to protect our commerce.

25

adopt their own laws to deal with overcharges within their

It's not enough

It expected other countries to

11
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

own territories, and other nations, of course, have done

2

just that.

3

legislation all around the world, from Albania to Zambia,

4

we see new antitrust laws that have been passed, and it

5

would discourage that process if the U.S. courts attempted

6

to subsume all of these foreign overcharge disputes into

7

our court system.

8
9

They've passed over 100 different pieces of

QUESTION: Let's -- let's assume that -- that we
find the textual argument in -- in effect a -- a draw.

10

One way to go your way would be to accept a comity

11

analysis, but I take it comity was never raised.

12

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, there is a kind of comity

13

that Justice Scalia referred to in the Hartford case that

14

we think is raised here, and that is comity bearing -­

15

comity among nations, not judicial comity where the judges

16

weigh various and sundry factors, but it's a rule of

17

interpretation that -- that discourages interpretations of

18

laws, where you have two interpretations that are

19

available, you pick the interpretation that is most

20

consistent with international law and which avoids

21

antagonizing our allies and our trading partners.

22

that concept is very much before the Court here, and I

23

think it argues very much in favor of the narrower

24

interpretation, particularly because Congress was

25

expecting that wholly foreign transactions, that's the

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

term used in the House report, would be litigated in

2

foreign nations, and -- and our -- our allies and trading

3

partners -­

4

QUESTION: Well, if we -- if we accept that and

5

textually the statute is a draw, we -- we wouldn't have to

6

get to this interpretative principle.

7

for getting to the interpretative principle that you now

8

suggest is -- is simply the submissions of -- of foreign

9

countries as well as the United States in this particular

11

I mean, one reason

case.
MR. SHAPIRO: Well, yes, we -- we think the

12

literal language and the structure of the statute are

13

sufficient to reverse here.

14

Court's endowed, it's very appropriate to use these

15

traditional tools of interpretation that go all the way

16

back to the Charming Betsy case that the Court, faced with

17

a choice between two readings of a statute, picks the

18

interpretation that is compatible with international law

19

and which avoids antagonizing our allies.

20

But to the extent that the

QUESTION: Well, how -- but how -- how do we know

21

those two factors?

How do we know what's consistent with

22

international law?

How do we know what's consistent with

23

not antagonizing our allies?

24
25

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, on the latter, we have amicus
briefs from seven of our -- our most significant trading

1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

4

partners, of allies -­
QUESTION: But surely there -- there are other
partners who have not been heard from.
MR. SHAPIRO: That's true, but all of the foreign

5

nations that have spoken up here agree with the United

6

States that this is contrary to their ability to regulate

7

commerce in their own nations.

8
9

No nation -­

QUESTION: These are nations with -- with fairly
effective antitrust laws and antitrust enforcement.

10

MR. SHAPIRO: Absolutely.

11

QUESTION: What about the majority of nations in

12

the world that don't have effective antitrust enforcement,

13

if indeed they have any antitrust laws?

14

eager to have us do the job for them?

15

Might they not be

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, there are 100 nations now

16

that do have aggressive antitrust enforcement programs,

17

and Congress' view in 1982 was that we should draw back in

18

our attempt to police the world because we want all these

19

other nations to adopt these rules.

20

the United States takes all of these cases into its

21

jurisdiction.

22

-- that they were encouraged to do by Congress.

23

That won't happen if

Other nations won't go the route that they

And I think it's also important to consider the

24

burden on our judicial system that the interpretation

25

advocated by my friends would impose.

14
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: Well, their argument is that these

2

cases simply come together anyway, these cases will

3

piggyback their way in or at least come hand in hand with

4

the domestic cases.

5

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, Your Honor, it -- these cases

6

are difficult to administer under the best of

7

circumstances, but consider global plaintiffs from 192

8

countries coming to the United States and asking a single

9

district court judge to decide how much they've been

10

overcharged, how much competition there was locally, what

11

trade barriers there were that might have prevented

12

competition, calculate the damages for every man, woman,

13

and child on the face of the Earth that perhaps is -- has

14

an antitrust claim.

15
16

QUESTION: Of course, I suppose that's the
penalty for engaging in worldwide conspiracy.

17

MR. SHAPIRO: But that penalty is imposed on our

18

district court judges.

They would -- would be forced to

19

untangle these incredibly difficult procedural problems,

20

and how are they going to give notice to people around the

21

globe in 192 languages with different dialects?

22

we even accomplish that and how could we make sure people

23

are actually protected in this global forum that's being

24

advocated?

25

do this.

How could

U.S. courts are not world courts equipped to

QUESTION: Could you just deny class action

2

certification if that's -- if you have that kind of

3

problem, but no -- nobody, none of these plaintiffs are

4

trying to sue on behalf of the whole world.

5

MR. SHAPIRO: Well, the plaintiffs here are -­

6

are alleging a class action of all the purchasers around

7

the world outside of the United States, and every one of

8

the cases that's been filed under this theory has been a

9

class action, so that's -- that's what we're seeing.

And

10

of course, in -- in a broad array of future cases, not

11

just price-fixing cases, but all Sherman Act cases are

12

subject to this FTAIA regime -­

13
14

QUESTION: Has any Federal court ever certified a
class that size, that all purchases around the globe?

ORAL ARGUMENT OF R. HEWITT PATE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

8

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. PATE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
Given the key role of deterrence, both in the

12

opinion below and in the respondents' arguments here, the

13

United States thinks it important to offer the Court an

14

accurate understanding of how international cartel

15

enforcement really works.

16

that we've begun to see dramatic success in detecting and

17

punishing international cartels, and that has come about

18

only by international cooperation with other enforcement

19

agencies and through the use of amnesty programs.

20

It's only in the past 8 years

There's nothing in the FTAIA, much less any

21

clear congressional statement, in a statute that after all

22

was jurisdiction-limiting in intent, that would require

23

jeopardizing our progress in those enforcement efforts

24

through a dramatic extraterritorial application of U.S.

25

treble damages litigation.

Even if there were,

17
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

established principles of standing under Section 4 of the

2

Clayton Act would nonetheless preclude that result.

3

QUESTION: Can you tell us how -- how it would

4

jeopardize your -- your efforts?

5

respondent here, wouldn't that make foreign conspirators

6

and -- and American companies all the more eager to come

7

to you, because then they could get immunity both for U.S.

8

actions and -- and the global effects?

9

Suppose we rule for the

MR. PATE: The -- the important point, Justice

10

Kennedy, is that under these amnesty programs, there is no

11

amnesty given for civil liability.

12

experience that when a company finds that its employees

13

have been engaged in wrongdoing, it balances the potential

14

for freedom from criminal liability against the certainty

15

that civil treble damages will follow.

16

type of sea change in the law that's advocated by

17

respondents here to provide for unquantifiable,

18

potentially unknowable worldwide liability will in our

19

type of conduct will instead hunker down and simply hope

not to be detected.

QUESTION: Mr. Pate, do you agree with Mr.

5

Shapiro's answer to my question about a plaintiff, an

6

American plaintiff who has business both in this country

7

and abroad and suffers -- and both are hurt by the

8

conspiracy?

9

MR. PATE: Yes, Justice Stevens, I do, because

10

under Section 4 of the Clayton Act, the plaintiff must

11

show that his own injury is, by reason of -­

12

QUESTION: Well, in my hypothetical it is his

13

injury, he does business both in the United States and in

14

Europe.

15

MR. PATE: Exactly.

But with respect to the

16

foreign incurred injuries, he must show injury by reason

17

of that which makes the conduct illegal, and since Alcoa

18

in 1954, and certainly under Hartford, it is the effect on

19

U.S. commerce that makes the conduct the concern of the

20

Sherman Act in the first place so that he cannot show that

21

he's been injured by reason of that which makes the

22

conduct illegal.

23

QUESTION: I don't follow the -­

24

QUESTION: I -- I thought Hartford left that

25

question open.

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. PATE: Hartford -­

2

QUESTION: I mean, Hartford specifically

3

addressed the export, but it -- it -- my recollection is,

4

in the footnote, it expressly left any -- any further

5

effect of the statute in open question.

6

MR. PATE: That's correct, Justice Souter.

The

7

Court did not address the statute.

I was simply pointing

8

out that in foreign commerce cases, it is the effect on

9

U.S. commerce rather than the conduct itself that causes

10

that conduct to be the concern of U.S. antitrust laws.

11

Absent the effect on U.S. commerce, there would be no

12

application of the U.S. antitrust laws.

13

Alcoa and true under Hartford.

That's true under

14

Now, with respect to the FTAIA, we think the

15

most natural reading of the statute is simply that the

16

Court look at the party bringing the claim before the

17

Court in construing section (a)(2).

18
19

QUESTION: The FTAIA was passed in 1982, is that
right?

20

MR. PATE: That's correct, Justice Breyer.

21

QUESTION: The division keeps track, I guess, but

22

is there any instance, or what instances are there, I'd

23

like to write them down unless there are dozens, in which

24

a foreign cartel injures the United States and also

25

separately injures people abroad.

What instances were

20
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

there in which the people in Uruguay or wherever could sue

2

the perpetrators in Holland in an American court prior to

3

1982?

4
5

MR. PATE: We're aware of no instance of such a
case and it -­

6
7

QUESTION: No such instance.

I'll ask the other

side the same question.

8

MR. PATE: It was clear and it is accepted as a

9

commonplace that a plaintiff who did not participate in

10

U.S. commerce, in trading in U.S. commerce, simply would

11

not have had the same -­

12

QUESTION: So you've looked it up and you can

13

find nothing in your opinion that counts as such an

14

instance?

15

MR. PATE: We're aware of no such case.

The

16

respondents have attempted to cite district court cases,

17

but if you look at each of those, you will find an effect

18

on U.S. commerce, and with respect to the Industria

19

Siciliana case mentioned in their brief, you'll find that

20

that was a case that was expressly disapproved by the

21

Congress when it passed the FTAIA, even if it could be

22

read that way, so that under the FTAIA, we think the

23

natural reading is simply to ask the court to look at the

24

claim before it and to ask whether the U.S. effect gives

25

rise to a claim on behalf of the party in court.

21
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

Where the United States is bringing a claim, any

2

time we can meet the direct, the effects test of Hartford

3

and Alcoa, we will always have a claim that has arisen

4

from a U.S. effect, so that there is no danger here to

5

U.S. enforcement, which continues under the application of

6

the FTAIA without any burden.

7

plaintiff, the private plaintiff must show that its own

8

claim is one that has been given rise to by a U.S. effect.

9

But as to a private

Turning to standing, we think even if the FTAIA

10

did not apply, that the proper result here would

11

nonetheless be reached under the Clayton Act, not only for

12

the -- by reason of rationale that Justice Stevens

13

mentioned in his question, but also because the plaintiffs

14

are not within the zone of interests that are protected by

15

the antitrust laws under this Court's opinion in

16

Matsushita and elsewhere, which makes clear that our

17

Sherman Act is not intended to set the competitive

18

conditions for other nations' economies.

19

And finally, if the Court simply were to apply

20

the remoteness or proximate cause rationale that's also

21

very prevalent in the Court's antitrust standing cases,

22

which excludes injuries, for example, to shareholders, to

23

employees, that the case also would not be proper under a

24

remoteness rationale, because these plaintiffs do not in

25

fact allege that they were the victims of an overcharge in

22
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

U.S. commerce.

2

that they made any attempt to purchase in U.S. commerce,

3

but would rather seek to use speculative transactions that

4

never occurred to make an end run around the FTAIA by

5

defining a so-called one-world market or one big

6

conspiracy theory.

7

They do not even allege, Justice Ginsburg,

To do that would certainly again be completely

8

contrary to this Court's holding in Matsushita, where the

9

Japanese aspects of a conspiracy were sought to be put

10

together with American aspects into one big claim.

11

Court plainly rejected that.

12

proceed on that theory, why would not the claim here be

13

equally seen to have been given rise to by effects in

14

France, effects in Great Britain, Russia, or elsewhere.

15

There is simply no limiting principle.

16

The

Indeed, if we were to

And as Mr. Shapiro suggests, to pursue this path

17

would embroil the district courts around the country in

18

all forms of satellite litigation, and it's very important

19

to recognize that this is not a test that would apply only

20

to a notorious worldwide criminal conspiracy, such as was

21

at issue here, but would apply to rule of reason cases,

22

joint venture cases, could apply even to Section 2 cases

23

under the Sherman Act any time a plaintiff was able to

24

allege that some other plaintiff somewhere suffered from a

25

U.S. effect that was related to that conduct.

And the

23
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

cases that Mr. Shapiro mentioned are good indications of

2

that.

3

So in our judgment, the Court should pay

4

attention to the practical realities of enforcement and

5

avoid doing damage to them, avoid creating friction with

6

our trading partners in a situation where whatever else

7

can be said, there is no clear congressional statement

8

that the FTAIA should be read to expand jurisdiction.

9

fact, the statute cannot on its terms expand jurisdiction

10

by reason of its language, which begins with a statement

11

that the antitrust laws shall not apply, and then puts the

12

plaintiff back where it was prior to the FTAIA if certain

13

conditions are met.

14

give additional causes of action or create additional

15

standing on behalf of parties who didn't have it prior to

16

the FTAIA.

17

In

In no case can the statute operate to

In short, all the Court need do is evaluate

18

respondents' own claim rather than the hypothetical claims

19

of others, and doing so will require dismissal.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
Justice Breyer, I will come to your question in

4

just a moment.

The petitioners are more than 20 U.S.

5

companies and their foreign affiliates who were caught

6

red-handed perpetrating the most damaging anti-competitive

7

conspiracy in the history of -­

8

QUESTION: Mr. Goldstein, do you agree with the

9

position of your opponents that the FTAIA was a limiting

10

statute and that if there was no claim before FTAIA, that

11

there certainly is none afterwards for your case?

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, but not

13

because the FTAIA applies.

14

have had a claim before the Sherman Act, before the '82

15

Act was adopted, and we intend to do so.

16

however, think that the '82 Act is illuminating because it

17

eliminated claims of other people and not ours, and that

18

would be the victims of a U.S. export cartel.

19

We have to prove that we would

I do know -- do,

Now, the reason our position is critical is the

20

one identified by Justice Kennedy, and that is that the

21

conspirators' cartel encompassed a worldwide market for

22

bulk vitamins and the worldwide market is relevant because

23

geographic boundaries don't have any meaning here.

24

conspiracy limited to U.S. commerce would have collapsed

25

as U.S. purchasers bought abroad, as Justice Scalia has

A

25
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

said, and there is a critical fact about the nature of the

2

worldwide market and how the United States enforces the

3

antitrust laws that has not been touched on in the first

4

half hour, and that is that U.S. antitrust law -- and Mr.

5

Chief Justice, this is prior to the 1982 Act -- deems

6

their conspiracy -- Justice Breyer, it's not the

7

individual transactions, it's the entire conspiracy -­

8

illegal, lock, stock, and barrel.

9

The U.S. Government in this case prosecuted the

10

petitioners not for price fixing in the United States and

11

not for market allocation in the United States, but price

12

fixing and market allocation in the United States and

13

abroad.

14

Sherman Act means, including after the 1982 Act, then it

15

will be the prosecutions of the United States that fall

16

along with our position.

17

If the petitioners are right about what the

QUESTION: No, no, I mean, their argument I take

18

it is simply, of course, there -- the quinine cartel,

19

which I had heard of, I'd not heard, the quinine cartel

20

sets in Holland and raises the price of quinine that's

21

sold all over the world, and of course it violates our law

22

and we're out there and they're lobbing these shells at us

23

in a sense, and so of course we can bring a claim against

24

them, it hurts us.

And so what business

do we have telling Uruguay, which thinks depression

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Breyer, I'm going to

answer it in three parts that will explain why it is that

you can't separate the civil and the criminal liability.

19

As you know much better than me, what's good for goose is

good for the gander.

Those cases do not say that

the quinine cartel was illegal insofar as it hurt us.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It's illegal, including the sales

in Ecuador and in Holland.

8

rollover between pages 1 and 2 of our red brief.

9

case, the Federal Government prosecuted Mr. Shapiro's

10

clients for price fixing and market allocation in the

11

United States and abroad.

12

Ecuador likes price fixing. I will come to the fact that

13

they don't, but it doesn't matter.

14

Sherman Act reaches the conspiracy and this Court's

15

precedents reach every bit, as I said, lock, stock, and

16

17

Justice Breyer, I -- I urge

Now, let me give you the reason why.

That was

18

your question.

Okay, assume -- you wanted to know why

19

Congress made that choice, and it made that choice

20

because, as Justice Scalia explained, we can't separate

21

what happens in Ecuador from what happens in U.S.

22

commerce.

23

consumers and our economy, it makes no difference at all

24

whether the sale was between Holland and Holland, New

25

Jersey, or instead Holland and Ecuador, because the cartel

It doesn't make, in terms of protecting our

Alderson Reporting Company

gets sustained, and that's also the point of Pfizer.

Congress recognized that and it made the cartel -­

it, it's a fact, so you're -­

(Laughter.)

10

MR. GOLDSTEIN: And it -- and we accept it.

12

MR. GOLDSTEIN: With good reason, I think.

Mr.

13

Chief Justice, our point is that the rationale -- I don't

14

want to -­

15

QUESTION: But I -- if you're on a -- it sounds

16

to me like you're a verbal point, which I'm not against.

17

Of course we say it is illegal what they do in Holland.

18

It's illegal when they hurt us, it's illegal when we hurt

19

them, we think it's illegal plain and simple.

20

that.

21

give a claim for damages by a -- to person in Uruguay for

22

activity that takes place in Holland, which we think is

23

illegal, but the Dutch and the Uruguayans don't.

that out of words in indictments that say American

I like -­

I think the antitrust laws are a marvelous policy, okay,

3

so I'm tempted to say, yes, it's illegal everywhere.

But

4

that isn't where I'm having the problem.

5

problem about finding -- I -- I'd be repeating myself, so

6

have you taken it in?

I'm having the

7

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

8

QUESTION: Okay, what's the answer?

9

MR. GOLDSTEIN: The answer is that the -- let me

10

take you to the text of Section 4 of the Clayton Act,

11

which I know you know, but it can't hurt to come to it,

12

and that's at the page 1a of the red brief.

13

of the Clayton Act says, any person who shall be injured

14

in his business or property by reason of anything

15

forbidden in the antitrust laws has the cause of action,

16

and that's what Congress said.

17

The Section 4

It's not, Justice Breyer, merely that we say, we

18

think you shouldn't do this in Ecuador.

19

not do it in Ecuador in order to defeat the cartel on the

20

whole.

21

QUESTION: Correct.

It is, you may

And if we had that alone,

22

that would be strong support, and the problem is we have

23

another sentence, which is the first sentence in the

24

FTAIA, whatever it is, and then you get to the second.

25

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay, but -­

Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: I'm -- I'm not -- I got off the train

2

even earlier.

I'm not -- I'm not sure that -- that when

3

an indictment describes an international conspiracy as an

4

international conspiracy, it amounts to saying that that

5

portion of the international conspiracy which does not

6

affect this country in any way is illegal.

7

that -- I think you're bound in your indictment to

8

describe the -- the actual conspiracy, and if it indeed is

9

one that covered the whole world, you're -- are you

I don't think

10

supposed to describe it as one that only applied to the

11

United States?

12

conspiracy.

13

which does not affect the United States is in any sense

14

illegal under United States law.

15

illegal.

16

Of course not.

You describe the actual

That does not prove that the portion of it

I don't think it is

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Justice Scalia, let me tell you

17

why I think that is contrary to settled precedents, and

18

Mr. Chief Justice, these are precedents just like Rose v.

19

Lundy that Congress would have had in mind in the 1982

20

act.

21

law on whether or not the Sherman Act actually made the

22

transactions, if we were to focus on them, illegal.

23

then, Justice Breyer, I want to come to whether or not the

24

'82 act changes that.

25

So I want to talk, Justice Scalia, about pre-1982

And

Justice Scalia, the decree in National Lead

31
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

affirmed by this Court, which is at pages 330 to 331 of

2

the Court's opinion, cancelled contracts that were in

3

purely foreign commerce.

4

- that established the decree, several agreements relating

5

to manufacture and trade, we deem the European markets are

6

but some of the links in the chain which was designed to

7

enthrall the entire commerce in titanium.

8

Bearing did the exact same thing, and the Solicitor

9

General argued in Timken that acts would have -- that

10

those acts would have violated the Sherman Act even if

11

they had related solely to the commerce of the foreign

12

nations.

13

To read from the opinion that ­

Timken Roller

Those precedents, Justice Scalia, if you look at

14

them, do say that the underlying activities that are in

15

the overt acts, if you will, in furtherance of the

16

conspiracy, are illegal under U.S. law, and that's for a

17

good reason.

doing.

You have to attack

QUESTION: But all of that is true and it does

22

not necessarily follow that we do or should permit a cause

23

of action.

24
25

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely, Justice Souter.

I

have to take this -- there are -- there are three parts to

32
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

the equation, and let me just, at each stage, because it

2

can get very complicated, talk about where we are in the

3

logic.

4

There is the second question, okay, is there a private

5

right of action?

And, Justice Souter, you identified the

6

third part to it.

What does comity have to say about it?

7

What do we do, assuming even if nominally the statute

8

applies and they can sue, but it nonetheless would bring

9

us into conflict with our trading partners.

10

There is the question, does the Sherman Act apply?

So I was answering, Justice Scalia, on the

11

first.

Justice Breyer and you have taken me to the

12

second, and that is, is there a private right of action,

particularly after the 1982 Act?

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It said that the FTAIA, the '82

Act didn't bar our claim.

We think that's right for two

6

reasons, the first it doesn't apply at all, and the second

7

is that clause 2, which is what gave rise to the split in

8

the circuits, doesn't require that the person's injury,

9

that the person's injury arise from an effect on U.S.

10

commerce.

It accepted the second of those propositions,

how in the world are we going to tell if some other person

The Second Circuit said, before the 1982 Act was
adopted there was a split.

There was a rule of the Second Circuit in a

original version of the 1982 bill, and it said, look, in

problem in our country, and so they added clause 2, and

21

that's, as I said, the United States said so in 1982, in

1983, every treatise did, every antitrust commentator.

lose part 3, and let -- let you focus on that, the comity.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

5

QUESTION: One possibility floating through my

6

mind is that there are international quinine or maybe

7

this, international vitamin cartels, where it's pure price

8

fixing, and in such instances, prices in one country may

9

be interdependent on another, and in such instances if you

show this interdependent thing, but anybody could come in

countries don't like at all, and bring lawsuits and

20

there's no way to prevent our law from becoming generally

21

imperialistic in this sense that I've been talking about.

22

That's a way of focusing you back on the comity question,

23

and you can answer mine, the comity, whatever you like.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.

And although he says the issue is nonetheless

10

here, his page -- page 41, note 16 of their brief in the

11

court of appeals expressly acknowledged that the question

12

is different from the question of comity presented in

13

Hartford Fire.

So that -­

14

QUESTION: But how -- how is it, in -- in the

15

hypothetical that Justice Breyer posed, that comity is

16

built in?

17

doesn't mean that it is.

18

If they -- simply because someone says it
I -- I just don't see how it is.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: I understand.

Justice Kennedy,

19

the courts of appeals leading up to Hartford Fire were

20

unanimous and then Hartford Fire cites with approval, for

21

example, a case called Mannington Mills, and that is that

22

the courts of appeals had always understood up to the

23

point of Hartford Fire, and then Hartford Fire applied the

24

same analysis, that comity is a restriction on the

25

exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by the Sherman Act,

38
Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

and so Hartford Fire endorses it.

2

And then subsequent to Hartford Fire -- and

3

Justice Breyer, I am coming back to the substance of the

4

comity analysis -- but let me just say that subsequent to

5

Hartford Fire, the courts of appeals have applied comity

6

robustly.

no cause to consider whether or not this case would

analysis in the case of monopolization or unfair trade

practices would preclude the exercise of U.S. antitrust

because you are dividing the universe up in to claims that

everybody agrees and more controversial applications of

U.S. antitrust law, but one of the principal objections,

23

as I understand it, from other nations is to the treble

24

25

they regulate antitrust, there are no treble damages.

They say, for their consumers, the way

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

So Justice Breyer, I'm

2

going to put on the table for a second whether or not our

3

law applies at all.

4

were to agree with that, if we were to say that our choice

5

of treble damages and their choice of single damages

6

represented a true conflict, and that is we were

7

undercutting a policy judgment by them, the solution would

8

not be to eliminate the jurisdiction that Congress

9

conferred in the Sherman Act.

In detour, Justice Ginsburg, if we

It would be to say you

10

can't get greater damages here than single damages,

11

because that's the norm.

12

the position is that comity, Congress intended comity to

13

carve back, what you would say is that Congress would have

14

intended in this instance not to allow the foreigners to

15

get treble damages.

16

That would be the solution.

QUESTION: What about a forum non conveniens

17

policy that says, you're a foreign purchaser, you

18

purchased abroad, you have a nice forum abroad to go to,

19

don't burden the U.S. courts.

20

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Absolutely.

There's no question

21

that -- I just cannot remind you enough times that the

22

petitioners are attempting to seriously jump the gun.

23

There was no forum non conveniens argument below, there

24

was no comity argument below, there was no conflict of

25

laws argument.

All of those -- for example, if there is a

2

There is a private class action ongoing in Australia.

3

have already had one of our claimants drop out of the case

4

and go to Australia, because everyone recognizes that's

5

where your remedy is at.

6

We

We have, however, a dilemma that Congress

7

recognized, and that is, as Justice Scalia said, with

8

respect to the great majority of the world, and we cite in

9

our brief the OECD's formal report on cartels, the seminal

10

report to the Attorney General on international antitrust,

11

a source after source after source that says there is

12

grave under enforcement of cartels, and I can illustrate

13

it here with two facts.

14

more than half of the volume of commerce in bulk vitamins,

15

more than half of it, they are going to get away with it.

16

The first is, with respect to

And that leads to the second fact, because

17

there's no enforcement, public or private, that leads to

the second fact, and that is, if they win here, they will

That is not a

So, Justice Ginsburg, that's quite right.

There

23

are mechanisms for dealing with the fact that there are

24

other remedies.

I would just put back on the table the

1

QUESTION: I don't really see what it's doing on

2

the table. I mean, it didn't require a Nobel Prize winner

3

to make me figure out that in fact the worse you treat the

4

people who make the cartel, the less likely they are to do

5

it.

6

quartered them or whatever, they'd do it even less.

7

what -- what is that to do with the price of fish, so to

8

speak?

But I mean, fine, you're right, if we hung and

9

But

MR. GOLDSTEIN: It -- it's the judgment that

10

Congress made, Justice Breyer, in the worldwide markets

11

that Justice Kennedy referenced in the first half hour,

12

and that is that we will be hurt, unless we go after them.

13

But it doesn't mean, Justice Breyer, that we go after them

14

for every Section 1 or every Section 2 violation.

15

So let me come all the way back to your original

16

question, and that is, okay, why is the comity analysis

17

different here and there?

18

argument that I was making, that's this is per se illegal.

19

It is -- the second point is that there are disagreements,

20

it's related, there are disagreements about whether the

21

primary conduct is illegal in that instance.

22

think a monopoly is a bad thing.

23

that everyone agrees that price fixing is bad.

24

an infringement on their ability to regulate primary

25

conduct.

Justice Ginsburg pointed to one

They don't

It is not

Alderson Reporting Company

If, for example, there was a country that said,

we love price fixing, I mean, we just think it's so much

better if things are expensive, well, then that might be a

different case and there might be a forum non motion, but

there are no such countries.

the rule you're advocating -- you say that don't -- don't

worry about the other case, because your case is okay.

But we are worried about the other case.

11

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Justice Kennedy, I -- I

think that's right.

I think that it is not sufficient for

13

me just to say, look, there'll be a comity analysis later

in the day.

But I would say that we are articulating a

17

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Okay.

18

QUESTION: It's still on the table.

19

MR. GOLDSTEIN: The rule, Justice Kennedy, is

20

that the Sherman Act applies, but unless there is a

21

worldwide market, so that we can say that the injury to

22

the person abroad is inextricably intertwined with the

23

injury to the person here, that claim lacks antitrust

24

standing because it will not directly advance U.S.

25

interests.

It is not necessary to advance the protection

2

QUESTION: So you have flushed them all out that

3

way.

Now, the ones you have left, which is yours which

4

you like, why can't you bring -- fit right within the

5

language here that where this worldwide market is in fact

6

such that its price in Bolivia is never going to hold up

7

unless the price in the United States holds up if you've

8

got the necessary causal relationship to effects in the

9

United States.

That's the second half which you said we

10

should remand.

I mean, maybe that's a good half.

11

wrong with that?

12

What's

MR. GOLDSTEIN: No, we're -- Justice Kennedy, let

13

me relate this to your question.

14

is saying, look, the first argument in the red brief is

15

this, this is a case in which the effects in the United

16

States -- and I will come to your Illinois Brick

17

objection, Justice Scalia -- the -- the effects in the

18

United States did give rise to our claims.

19

accept what they say, accept the Fifth Circuit's rule.

20

Look, if the cartel had not operated in this country, it

21

would have collapsed, he doesn't need a Nobel Prize, we

22

have one in case you did, and that means that our people

23

were injured.

24

our brief.

25

cases that you were worried about, Justice Breyer, because

We accept that.

That is, Justice Breyer

He says,

It's the first argument in

It means that the -- it limits out all of the

Alderson Reporting Company
1111 14th Street NW, Suite 400

Washington, DC 20005

1

in a monopolization case that won't be true, unfair trade

2

practices, that won't be true.

3

And then, Justice Ginsburg, notwithstanding that

4

we have a narrow field of cartel cases, there are only six

5

that have been filed, there are still other options on the

6

table for limiting the claim in the instance that there is

7

an available foreign remedy.

8

We would accept their argument, we would say there's a

9

narrow class of cases that, Justice Kennedy, are a true

So that's how it would work.

10

worldwide market where Congress recognized that, in cases

11

like American Tobacco that it had in mind in the 1982 Act,

12

and then we say, look, that's it, that's the full ball of

13

wax, we don't become an imperial source of law for the

14

world.

15
16

That's how we would analyze the case.
Now, we think that that too addresses any

concerns about manageability -­

17

QUESTION: If you think that the forum non

18

conveniens point would work, let's say, for our trading

19

partners who have told us they don't like treble damages

20

in any case, so are we going to make a distinction then

21

and accept the complaint of customers, purchasers of

22

vitamins in countries that don't have any antitrust laws,

23

but we would reject claims coming from, say, the U.K. or

24

QUESTION: Well, but that -- that in itself is a

7

rather elaborate inquiry that you find nowhere in the

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Well, Justice -- Mr. Chief

10

Justice, the reason is that forum non conveniens is a

11

principle that's generally applicable to the law and -­

12

QUESTION: Yeah, but forum non conveniens is

13

ordinarily not that you have different law, but there are

14

other factors that make it inconvenient to try the case.

15
16

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, that's right.
I think Justice Ginsburg's view is that where we have -­

If you'd just answer your -- my

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Mr. Chief Justice, those factors

21

are relevant.

and vindicate your claim?

very important part of the analysis.

that the ones that don't can sue here, and the ones that
do can't sue here.

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.

thought, that the Canadians could sue here, but I -- now

QUESTION: But would you get to my Illinois Brick

question before your time runs out.

4

MR. GOLDSTEIN: Yes.

5

QUESTION: And just so I put the question as -­

6

as clearly as possible, it seems extraordinary to me that

7

if this -- if a foreign company had been injured by buying

8

drugs from an American company that bought them from the

9

conspirators at an excessively high price, that foreign

10

company would not have a cause of action.

11

saying that a foreign company has a cause of action by

12

reason of the fact that had the American company not

13

purchased at the artificially high conspiratorial price,

14

but at a lower price, they might have purchased from that

15

-- from that intermediate person, and -- whereas Illinois

16

Brick would clearly bar the first suit, you're saying it

17

doesn't bar the second suit as a rationale for allowing

18

them to sue here, and that strikes me as very strange.

19

But you're

MR. GOLDSTEIN: There are three answers, Justice

20

Scalia. The first two relate to the technical requirements

21

of Illinois Brick and the third explains why you shouldn't

22

read Illinois Brick to bar such claims.

23

we're not merely talking about arbitragers.

24

The intermediary isn't a necessary part of

The second is that even though you buy from an

4

intermediary, under Illinois Brick you still have a claim,

5

and that is you have a right to bring an action for an

6

injunction.

7

The third is that, look, our reading, the one

8

that says, and that Justice Breyer has hypothesized,

9

accept what they're saying and allow the claim only if the

10

injury is tied into a worldwide market.

11

that protects U.S. interests.

12

the structure, whereas -- that would allow you to look at

13

the foreigners through clause 2, but eliminate all of

their claims on Illinois Brick grounds, would render the

ineffectual.

That's a reading

deterrence concept here, but it's important to remember

that the Government, supported by seven of our allies and

16

trading partners, has said that this position is going to

undermine deterrence.

19

you get zero deterrence if you don't have actual detection

20

of overseas cartel behavior.

Why?

Because it's going to reduce

21

The key to getting the detection is the amnesty

200 years ago, and what it means is that if a particular

alternative is presented that broadly construes our laws

11

to intrude into the affairs of other nations and cause

12

friction, that interpretation is going to be rejected, and

13

that was certainly not rejected in the Hartford case.

14

That's a rule of statutory interpretation that

Professor Areta, in his treatise, pointed out

15

that our antitrust laws do not rule the entire commercial

16

world, and that's a concept that's written right into

17

Section 1 of the Sherman Act.

18

is commerce among the states and commerce with foreign

19

nations, not commerce within foreign nations, not commerce

20

between foreign nations.

discord in the form of claw-back statutes, blocking

So if our courts take these issues over

Our closest allies have responded to

overreaching that way, and Congress wanted to minimize

that problem with passage of the statute.

Now, the Timken case that counsel referred to

Now, on this worldwide market point, the -- the
