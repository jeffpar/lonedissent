ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. CORDRAY: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:

11

I'd like to reserve 2 minutes of my time for

12

rebuttal.

13

the face of a judicial warrant that the court of appeals

14

held deprived Agent Groh of qualified immunity, subjecting

15

him to personal liability for damages in this Bivens

16

action.

17

fact that the record here shows Agent Groh's manifest good

18

faith and reasonable course of conduct, including three

19

key points.

20

This case concerns a mistaken description on

The Ninth Circuit reached this result despite the

21

application submitted to the magistrate were sufficient

and comprehensive.

out in the affidavit and -

3

QUESTION: Mr. Cordray, what does the
Constitution provide specifically about this?

4

MR. CORDRAY: The Constitution provides that

5

individuals will not be subject to unreasonable searches

6

and seizures and that warrants will not issue except upon

7

probable cause, and stating with particularity the items

8

to - place to be searched, items to be seized.

9
10

QUESTION: With regard to that last phrase, why
don't we just apply it?

11
12

MR. CORDRAY: I think you do apply it in this
case and this warrant here -

13

QUESTION: But the warrant refers to the house.

14

MR. CORDRAY: Yes.

15

QUESTION: It doesn't list anything that they

16

were searching for.

17

MR. CORDRAY: The warrant itself - and if we turn

18

to the petition for certiorari appendix, page 26a,

19

specifically references the affidavit.

20

application, and draft warrant form were submitted to the

21

magistrate as one package.

24

QUESTION: Who prepared the warrant?

25

MR. CORDRAY: The draft of the warrant form

1

itself was done initially by Agent Groh.

2

signed and executed by the magistrate who approved it.

3
4
5

QUESTION: Well, but on its face it referred to
the house, not the items being looked for.
MR. CORDRAY: It did, and that's the mistaken

6

description on the face of the warrant.

7

the application and -

10
11

It was then

If you look at

QUESTION: Well, you know, why not just apply the
constitutional provision?

I mean, why couldn't the agent

be responsible for checking the warrant?
MR. CORDRAY: Well, I - I think there's two

12

questions there.

13

constitutional provision here, the warrant here

14

specifically references the affidavit.

15

says, I am satisfied, page 26a -

16
17
18

I think if you - if you apply the

The magistrate

QUESTION: But the affidavit was not attached to
the warrant.
MR. CORDRAY: It was attached to the warrant,

19

accompanied the warrant when - when the materials went to

20

the magistrate for approval - it was -

21
22
23

QUESTION: Yeah, but not - not when it was taken
to be executed.
MR. CORDRAY: It - it also accompanied the

24

warrant when the officers were briefed on the nature of

25

the search.

It did not accompany the warrant at the scene

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because it was placed under seal by the court, which is

2

done routinely in many cases for - for a variety of

3

important law enforcement purposes.

4

But here -

QUESTION: It - it - it seems to me that at - at

5

some point in this analysis of - and specifically on the

6

point that you're addressing with Justice O'Connor - that

7

you have to confront the language in - in Leon in which

8

the Court said, depending on the circumstances of the

9

particular case, a warrant may be facially - so facially

10

deficient that it cannot comply with the Leon rule.

I was

11

reading your - your brief and kind of waiting with

12

suspense for you to address this point and it only comes

13

up at the last few pages of the reply brief and you say

14

it's a dictum.

15

point, but it seems to me rather central for what you're

16

discussing right here.

17

facially deficient, no - no question about that.

I think you have answers to the - to the

This was in one sense of the word

18

MR. CORDRAY: Yes, although this Court has -

19

QUESTION: And it might be that the Sheppard case

20
21

is what helps you, but MR. CORDRAY: I think it does, Your Honor.

The

22

Sheppard case makes clear - footnote 7, the Court says

23

that if the warrant says, has some sort of suitable words

24

of reference, see attached affidavit or see affidavit,

25

that you then can move beyond the four corners of the

1

paper itself and look to the materials that are part of

2

the document or your record in front of the magistrate

3

that are subject to subsequent judicial review, and the

4

contents of the affidavit can inform the contents of the

5

warrant.

6

QUESTION: Mr. Cordray -

7

QUESTION: Well, did - did the warrant here and

8

the warrant in Sheppard, were they on all fours insofar as

9

a cross-reference?

10

MR. CORDRAY: They were on all fours in two

11

respects.

12

facially defective.

13

controlled substances.

14

evidence of homicide investigation.

15
16
17

First of all, the warrant in Sheppard was
It said that you would search for
In fact, they were searching for

QUESTION: Right, almost as bad as the mistake
here.
MR. CORDRAY: Yeah, in - in some ways worse,

18

because it specified the search for different evidence.

19

Here at least on the face of the warrant it's clear that

20

there's some sort of discrepancy, and you can inform that

21

by looking at the affidavit -

22

QUESTION: But did the Massachusetts case have a

23

cross-reference to an affidavit even though the affidavit

24

wasn't appended?

25

MR. CORDRAY: It did not, in fact, and the Court

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

said that if it had contained some sort of cross-

2

reference, then you could inform the contents of the

3

warrant from the contents of the affidavit.

4

we believe -

5

That's what

QUESTION: But doesn't it make sense to assume

6

that the cross-reference has to be capable of informing of

7

what is left out?

8

nothing attached to the warrant.

9

warrant could possibly figure out what within this house

And in this case, number one, there is
No one reading the

was - was being searched for.

11

MR. CORDRAY: I think that's -

12

QUESTION: And once again I guess I go back to

13

Justice O'Connor's question.

14

Fourth Amendment the way it's written, and it says that

15

the warrant shall particularly describe, not some other

16

document under seal.

17

Why don't we apply the - the

MR. CORDRAY: I - I think that that's not true in

18

the important respects under the Fourth Amendment.

19

affidavit was part of the documents given to the

20

magistrate for prior judicial approval -

The

21

QUESTION: The Fourth Amendment says it's the

22

warrant that is supposed to particularly describe, not

23

documents given to a magistrate.

24
25

MR. CORDRAY: What I'm saying is there are three
different potential times that matter here.

One is prior

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

judicial approval of the search.

The warrant and

2

application and affidavit were all together to the

3

magistrate.

4

conduct the search, which they did here in accordance with

5

the constraints, the - the material was provided to the

6

officers.

7

the scene has some independent constitutional right to see

8

the warrant and the supporting materials before a search

9

can proceed.

Second, in informing the officers of how to

The third question is whether the homeowner at

This Court has never held that that's a

10

constitutional requirement and would be flatly

11

inconsistent with criminal -

12

QUESTION: Whether - whether the homeowner has

13

the right or whether the point is to make sure that the

14

officers executing the warrant can check what's in front

15

of them and find out how far to go, the fact remains that

16

the Fourth Amendment says the warrant is supposed to

17

particularly describe.

18

appended to it that did.

19

This didn't, it had no document

MR. CORDRAY: That's not correct, Your Honor.

20

This warrant specifically references the affidavit and the

21

affidavit accompanied to the magistrate and to the

22

officers before they searched -

23
24
25

QUESTION: It may refer to it, but if it's not
there, nobody can figure out what it says.
MR. CORDRAY: Well, they can, in fact, because

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the documented record before the magistrate allows

2

posterior judicial oversight of how the search -

3
4

QUESTION: Not when the police are at the scene
they can't.

5

MR. CORDRAY: That is correct.

At the scene -

6

the Ninth Circuit made a fundamental flaw in its opinion.

7

It assumed that the Fourth Amendment is about allowing

8

homeowners at the scene to -

9

QUESTION: It doesn't have to make that

10

assumption in - in order to apply the Fourth Amendment as

11

written.

12

the point of the Fourth Amendment description was to make

13

sure that the officers at the scene knew how far they

14

could go.

15
16

It could perfectly well make the assumption that

MR. CORDRAY: Correct.

And they had the warrant,

affidavit, and application -

17

QUESTION: But there's some might not - some

18

might not have been like the officer here, like Officer

19

Groh, might not have even seen the attached affidavit.

20

the face of this, this does look like the hated general

21

warrant.

22

all, so it looks like this is exactly what the Fourth

23

Amendment was getting at.

24

had a question, maybe you can straighten me out on that.

25

Sheppard said the good-faith exception applies, but to

On

It says, here's a house and there's no bounds at

And with respect to Sheppard, I

1

apply - apply an exception, wouldn't you need to have a

2

Fourth Amendment violation in the first place?

3

MR. CORDRAY: This was a subject of discussion in

4

Sheppard.

5

specifically, and presents an argument for why the Fourth

6

Amendment was not violated in that case.

7

willing to assume a violation on the record before it,

8

didn't specifically decide the Fourth Amendment question

9

but assumed such a violation and went on to apply the good

The majority was

faith -

11
12

The separate opinion by Justice Stevens states

QUESTION: So that - that case doesn't answer the
question, was there a Fourth Amendment violation?

13

MR. CORDRAY: I would agree with you that -

14

QUESTION: And why do you have to ask that

15

question?

16

MR. CORDRAY: Beg your pardon?

17

QUESTION: Why do you have to ask that question?

18

Why do you have to establish, as you seem to be trying to

19

establish, that this complied with the Fourth Amendment,

20

which, if you read the Fourth Amendment, it clearly

21

didn't.

22

remedy for its failure to comply with the Fourth

23

Amendment, aren't we?

But what we're discussing here is what is the

24

MR. CORDRAY: Well -

25

QUESTION: If - if I disagree with you that there

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

- that there is a Fourth Amendment violation, do I have to

2

find that it was proper as a remedy for that violation to

3

hold - to hold this agent liable?

4

MR. CORDRAY: Certainly not, Your Honor, and I do

5

agree with Justice Ginsburg's point that Sheppard is

6

probably more germane to the qualified immunity inquiry

7

here than perhaps to the Fourth Amendment inquiry, given

8

that the Court did not explicitly decide the Fourth

9

Amendment issue in Sheppard.

But here, we would say that

10

qualified immunity applies on two distinct grounds.

11

First, the Court has adverted in Malley v. Briggs, it

12

wasn't a specific holding, that if in fact the conduct of

13

the officers is such that the good-faith Leon exception

14

would apply in a criminal suppression hearing then, in

15

parallel, qualified immunity should apply in a civil

16

action against the officer.

17

finding qualified immunity here and a sufficient ground.

That would be one ground for

18

In addition, if the law was not clearly

19

established at the time that - a number of points that the

20

Ninth Circuit decided for the first time in this case -

21

that the warrant cannot, by suitable words of reference,

22

incorporate the contents of the affidavit.

23

that the officers are obliged constitutionally after a

24

warrant issues to double check the magistrate's handiwork

25

and correct any errors that they find.

Number two,

And number three,

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that they cannot at the scene, as Agent Groh attempted

2

reasonably to do here, inform the homeowner of exactly

3

what the nature of the search was.

4

in person with the wife and over the telephone with the

5

husband, and -

6
7
8
9
10

It was done verbally

QUESTION: Well, you - you say, the Ninth Circuit
said they couldn't inform the homeowner?
MR. CORDRAY: Said that that would not be
sufficient to - to correct QUESTION: Yeah, it didn't say that they couldn't

11

have, but it's - it's - the Ninth Circuit said that the

12

homeowner had a right to be shown the warrant, I take it,

13

did it not?

14

MR. CORDRAY: Didn't specifically hold that, but

15

certainly seemed to presume it, that the - not only the

16

warrant but all the supporting materials so that the

17

homeowner could exercise some self-help right at the

18

scene, block the officers, and attempt to interfere with

19

their execution of -

20

QUESTION: The Ninth -

21

QUESTION: What do the Federal rules say about

22

the - what the police or the officers have to do with the

23

warrant in the search of a house?

24
25

MR. CORDRAY: Criminal Rule 41, which this Court
has said incorporates or is certainly consistent with

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Fourth Amendment principles, says that a warrant needs to

2

be left at the scene after a search is completed if

3

property is taken along with an inventory of the property.

4

There's no suggestion the rule does not require the

5

warrant be given to the homeowners at the outset as long

6

as they're reasonably informed -

7
8

QUESTION: Doesn't it talk - or correct me if I'm
wrong - about serving the warrant?

9

MR. CORDRAY: It - it talks about a number of

10

things.

It talks about obtaining a warrant, keeping a

11

documentary record in front of the magistrate so that

12

subsequent judicial review is available.

13

about executing the warrant at the - at the scene.

14

Court wishes to refer to Criminal Rule 41, it's been

15

amended a couple of times, I believe the current version

16

is 41(f) -

It also talks
If the

17

QUESTION: Where is that in the papers?

18

MR. CORDRAY: It's not in the documents here.

I

19

apologize, Your Honor.

But 41(f)(3), it's referred to in

20

the Solicitor General's brief and in our brief, is that

21

they must give a copy of the warrant, receipt for the

22

property taken, after the search is completed, but not

23

before the search begins, and that makes a great deal of

24

sense.

25

there is - there is prior judicial authority to proceed

The Fourth Amendment is about making sure that

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

with a search and that there is documentation available

2

later to check the search and make sure it did not exceed

3

the authority -

4

QUESTION: You mentioned the later documentation,

5

but isn't there an interest in letting the homeowner know

6

that the man has authority to make the search?

7

MR. CORDRAY: Yes, which Agent Groh -

8

QUESTION: So, shouldn't - shouldn't he have to

9

display it if - if requested?

10

MR. CORDRAY: I believe that if - if he's asked

11

for the warrant before he can enter, what would be

12

reasonable in the circumstances would be to show the

13

warrant.

14

QUESTION: And he'd have a duty to do that?

15

MR. CORDRAY: I - I believe that in many cases

16

that would be the most reasonable thing, and therefore

17

perhaps the Constitution would have required it.

18
19

QUESTION: That's not my question.
a duty to do that?

20
21

Would he have

MR. CORDRAY: I'm not certain of that, but I
think it would be better practice and reasonable conduct.

22

QUESTION: Go back -

23

QUESTION: It doesn't say it in the rule at all.

24

QUESTION: Could you go back to Justice Scalia's

25

question?

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CORDRAY: Sure.

2

QUESTION: I thought that this was a very simple

3

case.

4

made a technical mistake.

5

for and seize some guns, they said, look for and seize a

6

house, all right?

7

any sense.

8
9

Somebody really mucked up the warrant, okay?

They

Instead of saying, seize - look

Now, nobody could think that that made

MR. CORDRAY: Yeah, except that before printing
the affidavit -

10

QUESTION: Nobody.

No - you don't think it does,

11

I don't think it does.

12

things: A, that the warrant is constitutional, which is

13

what you're arguing, which is a little tough, because I

14

guess if we said this was constitutional, we'd have to say

15

a warrant is constitutional.

16

says I'm not going to tell you, look in vault three of the

17

Kremlin, you know, to see what we're supposed to seize.

18

mean, that's a tough route that you're taking.

19

So you can say one of three

If it says seize and then it

I

The second route is what Justice Scalia

20

suggested, which is to say, well, it isn't really his

21

fault, the search team leader, because he was in good

22

faith.

23

eye on this piece of paper and just glanced at it, he

24

would have seen it was faulty.

25

they're right in their lawsuit, let them bring it,

For me, that's tough because I - if you cast his

Route three is to say,

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

damages, by the way, are going to be pretty low, okay?

2

Now you explain to me why it should be route two, which is

3

Justice Scalia's question, rather than just route three.

4

MR. CORDRAY: Sure.

This Court said in Malley

5

that if in fact the officers make a mistake of fact in

6

good faith that, if in fact Leon would apply to avoid

7

suppressing that evidence in a criminal prosecution, the

8

parallel should apply and qualified immunity would be

9

appropriate in a civil action.

10

I think that that is what

makes the most sense of the objective -

11

QUESTION: Now - now tell me why, because as I've

12

made my point, it sounds to me that this man did not

13

behave sensibly, because if he just looked at the piece of

14

paper he would have seen in 3 seconds it says, seize the

15

house, and we're not out here to seize the house, we're

16

out to seize some guns.

17

MR. CORDRAY: The magistrate -

18

QUESTION: So it wasn't like a minor, common

19

mistake -

20

MR. CORDRAY: The magistrate -

21

QUESTION: - so why was that reasonable?

22

MR. CORDRAY: The magistrate also looked at this

23

piece of paper and failed to notice the error.

24

materials were made -

25

The

QUESTION: How do we know that the magistrate did
look at the piece of paper?

3
4

MR. CORDRAY: Because he signed the piece of
paper.

5

QUESTION: Any magistrate who looked at that

6

piece of paper would say your warrant - your warrant

7

application or the form you've given me does not indicate

8

My point was that you -

18

MR. CORDRAY: That's fine.

19

QUESTION: - not that we don't have to decide it.

20

MR. CORDRAY: That's fine.

Let me - let me say,

21

under Massachusetts v. Sheppard, this is clearly in good

22

faith here.

23

Because this agent prepared all the materials, submitted

it all to the magistrate, is the one who personally had

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AUSTIN C. SCHLICK

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE

14

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

15
16

MR. SCHLICK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:

17

This Court has rejected a technical perfection

18

standard in construing a warrant.

In Steele v. United

19

States, the warrant authorized a search of 611 West 46th

20

Street.

21

circumstances of the case, including the affidavit that

22

was submitted to the magistrate in that case, that the

23

search properly was conducted for 609 West 46th Street, as

24

well as 611, and the rules - the rules stated in Steele v.

25

United States is that a warrant satisfies the

This Court determined, in light of the

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

particularity requirement of the warrant clause if an

2

officer executing a search could determine with reasonable

3

effort what the magistrate authorized.

4

QUESTION: So do you say this is just a technical

5

mistake?

6

seize the Empire State Building, that's just a technical

7

mistake?

8

reason, but you'd have no idea what they're supposed to

9

look for.

10

If it said, go to the Empire State Building and

I mean, they may have made it for a technical

MR. SCHLICK: And it - the question in that case,

11

Your Honor, would be, is it clear what the magistrate

12

authorized?

In this case -

13

QUESTION: No, it isn't clear.

How is it clear?

14

MR. SCHLICK: In - in that case, if it is not

15

clear, then there is a violation of the particularity

16

requirement -

17

QUESTION: But you're saying here it's clear

18

because the affidavit said it, but the affidavit's locked

19

away somewhere and nobody can look at it.

20

MR. SCHLICK: No, it's - it - is - in fact it was

21

unsealed, and typically when warrants are put - when

22

applications are placed under seal, there's a provision

23

for unsealing the application upon the indictment or after

24

a period of time, or a motion to unseal can be brought,

25

which could have been done in this case, but in fact, the

1

motion was brought by the Government in the - in the first

2

place.

3

QUESTION: So, in fact, what a homeowner's

4

supposed to do is if the warrant - he looks at it, by the

5

way, it's blank, it's blank.

6

worry, I'm not going to tell you what I'm looking for, but

7

just go somewhere to a court house and make a motion to

8

unseal an affidavit and that will solve the problem.

9

And the officer says, don't

Is -

is that what the Fourth Amendment is about?

10

MR. SCHLICK: The Fourth Amendment does not

11

protect, contrary to the Ninth Circuit's belief, the

12

Fourth Amendment does not protect the - a supposed

13

interest in reviewing the warrant during the search.

14

Mr. Cordray explained, that's inconsistent with Rule 41.

15

It also would render impossible electronic surveillance.

16

The - there also would be a serious safety concern.

simply do not want citizens contesting at the scene of the

19

is lawful.

QUESTION: Well, I don't want - the - the court

21

of appeals seemed to envision some sort of a collaborative

proceeding where there's a conversation between the

MR. SCHLICK: Under Rule 41, the right attaches

9

He says, well, oh no, you can't see

Is that - is that your position?

MR. SCHLICK: No, again that would be analyzed

10

under the law of knock and announce, and it may be

11

reasonable under the circumstances -

12
13

And

QUESTION: If they have a warrant, do I have a
right to read the warrant?

14

MR. SCHLICK: And the question would be -

15

QUESTION: The homeowner.

16

MR. SCHLICK: If - if the homeowner denied entry

17

until a copy of the warrant is provided, the officer would

18

be faced with the question, is this a constructive denial

19

of entry?

Is there some exigency for getting into the

20

property?

And it may be reasonable under the

21

circumstances -

22

QUESTION: No, there - no, there - there's no

23

exigency because there's only one person there and he's at

24

the door and that person says, I'd like to read this

25

warrant.

Does he have the right to do that before the

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

officer enters?

2

MR. SCHLICK: If there were no exigencies, then

3

ordinarily the reasonableness principle probably would

4

require that, but the purpose of the particularity

5

requirement, it's very clear, is to ensure that the search

6

is conducted in accordance with what the magistrate

7

authorized.

8

QUESTION: Why isn't that in our rule if - if

9

you're willing to concede that that's a constitutional

10

requirement?

11

MR. SCHLICK: We - we are not conceding it's a

12

constitutional requirement.

14

We're saying that under

QUESTION: Well, that - you say - you say it's

15

18

there is no exigency where the request to see the warrant

20

QUESTION: Under normal circumstances, when there

MR. SCHLICK: Our position, Your Honor, is there

MR. SCHLICK: A - a search would not be rendered

The question would be how the

11

MR. SCHLICK: That - that's true and, of course,

the things that are seized may not conform to the warrant

because of the plain view rule that the officer may seize

MR. SCHLICK: Now, under the law of qualified

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:

5

The Ramirez home was searched pursuant to a

6

nonsensical warrant.

They were deprived of the

7

protections of the essential function of the warrant,

8

which this Court has said is to assure the individual

whose property is being searched and seized of the lawful

10

authority of the executing officer, his need to search,

11

and the limits of his power to search.

requirement has -

The particularity

QUESTION: Where - where do - where do we say
that?

Did we say that in a case that MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, Your Honor, you say that

16

in - it was actually quoted in the McGrew case.

17

stated in Illinois v. Gates and in citing Chadwick at page

18

9 in California v. Acevedo.

19

It was

QUESTION: If - if - if that is indeed the

20

purpose of the warrant, isn't it passing strange that the

21

rules relating to warrants do not require that the warrant

22

be served, be presented to the individual, unless and

23

until something is taken, at which point the warrant has

24

to be left plus a list of the things taken?

25

just find it remarkable that our rules of criminal

procedure would not require the service of a warrant, and

2

indeed, if that is the purpose of a warrant, what do you

3

do about warrants for electronic surveillance, for

4

wiretaps?

5

the wiretap with a warrant saying, we're going to be

6

tapping your phone, so he'll say, oh, thank you very much,

7

you know, I'll use another phone.

Does - do - do you have to serve the object of

8

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: With - with respect to a

wiretap, you have some exigent circumstances there.

What

10

the - what the Ramirezes were facing were the search of

11

their home -

12
13
14

QUESTION: It's not - what's exigent - what's
exigent about it?

Not necessarily, I -

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: There's no necessarily -

15

there's - with a wiretap there's no invasion, a physical

16

invasion of the home and the rummaging through their

17

personal belongings.

QUESTION: Counsel, I suppose you don't have to

19

take the position that there's some right of the homeowner

20

to examine the warrant before the officer is admitted to

21

the home to win this case, do you?

22

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's true, Your -

23

QUESTION: Why are you taking that position then?

24

That gets you into a lot of hot water, because it hasn't

25

been clearly defined.

I mean, the Ninth Circuit seemed to

1

place a lot of weight on the point, but I'm not sure it is

2

necessary for you to prevail in this case.

3

hear your views.

4

I'd like to

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Your - Your Honor, that - that

5

is correct.

6

it was plain to see, but the - the Ninth Circuit has

7

established a very - clearly established rule to say that

8

Under those circumstances it would become part

of the warrant and they would recognize that, and the

months after the conduct in question?

that the executing officer has to read the warrant, but

3

that wasn't on the books when this search occurred.

It said

However, the

QUESTION: But what made the law clear in the

10

Ninth Circuit was not the timing of the McGrew search, but

11

the ruling of the Ninth Circuit.

12

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The - the McGrew decision said

13

that it was clearly established at - through their - their

14

prior decisions of the requirement that the warrant refer

15

to and either have attached to or accompany the affidavit

particularity requirement, and it - it looked at other

18

cases besides just that one.

QUESTION: I see that there is a serious

21

question, I think, underlying what you're saying.

22

saying that this is really a question of cross-reference.

23

The Constitution requires the warrant to describe the

24

things to be seized.

25

this - we have permitted in cases that requirement to be

Now, what the Government says is

blank or erroneous, but it cross-references another

document.

7

Scalia, I think, asked why - why is that?

8

purpose of the Fourth Amendment is not to alert the

9

homeowner, but simply to be certain there is a check on

10

the searcher, why have the cases come out the way you've

11

just described them?

12

And you've said, it can do that where that

There was one case that said in the

Because if the

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because it's a - not to have

13

that warrant or the supporting documentation to the

14

warrant present to meet the particularity requirement is

15

an opportunity for abuse.

16

QUESTION: What kind of abuse?

17

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: To be abuse to - to the - that

18

the officer can come to the home, say I'm planning - I'm

19

planning to search for - for something, ransack the house,

20

find nothing, leave no warrant, and the person has no idea

21

of the legal authority of - of why the officer was there,

what he was doing there.

decide he wants to go in and rummage through the personal

24

papers and -

25

He could have the opportunity to

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

question that Justice Scalia raised earlier.

2

there is a violation of the Fourth Amendment, you're

3

bringing a Bivens action, and if we recall the facts in

4

Bivens that - the police acted as rough as can be, they

5

manacled the man, they told him they were going to arrest

6

his wife and children, they hauled him off to jail and

7

they strip-searched him.

8
9

Assuming

Nothing like that happened here.

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's correct, Your Honor.
However, Bivens 19 - in 1983 action, depending upon

10

whether the actor is State or Federal agent, follow the

11

same - same line of reasoning of whether - was the action

12

a violation of constitutional right and was it objectively

13

reasonable.

14

QUESTION: But the damages here, nothing happened

15

here that would not have happened if the right portion of

16

the application had been copied into the warrant.

17

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The - the - the damages was to

18

- to the - the homeowner's ability to be assured of the

19

authority of the officer to be here.

20

QUESTION: Well, I'm not sure about that.

Does

21

the homeowner say, well, I'd like to - this is a long

22

warrant, I have to sit down and read this, and they sit

23

down by the fire and read the warrant and discuss it?

24

That's not the way it works.

25

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Under the circumstances of this

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

case, there was no opportunity ever for the - the

2

homeowner to - to know what -

3

QUESTION: Well, but we're asking what the

4

general requirement is.

Once - once the homeowner finds

5

that the police have the authority to enter, then don't

6

the cases teach us that the purpose of the warrant is to

7

control the discretion of the officer, not the knowledge

8

of the homeowner, and incidentally, I think you might be

9

able to read Rule 41 as saying that when an officer leaves

10

he has to give a copy of the warrant whether he takes

11

anything or not.

12

right interpretation.

I'm - I'm not quite sure that that's the

13

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Well, you're -

14

QUESTION: Let's assume that that's done.

I

15

don't think the homeowner has the right to monitor the

16

search.

17

Ninth Circuit seemed to say - think that.

18

There's - there's no authority for that.

The

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, Your Honor, the Ninth

19

Circuit said that and, in fact, in the Gant case, which

20

was cited in - in McGrew, they said that there's a - a

21

duty of the officer under the rule to provide the

22

homeowner with the warrant prior to leaving the scene.

23
24
25

QUESTION: Under the rule, they said?
rule?

Under the

Well.
MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, Your Honor.

1
2

QUESTION: That's not true, is it?

I mean, you -

you can create such a duty -

3

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No.

4

QUESTION: - but it doesn't appear in the rule at

5
6

all, does it?
MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The - the Gant decision that

7

referred to the - to the rule was looking at the - the

8

argument was made in that case by the Government that the

9

rule only required it, and said that since the - the Katz

10

decision says that it - the rule does not invariably

11

require it to - the Government to serve the warrant, that

12

it must usually require that it be done.

13

QUESTION: Doesn't say anything at all about

14

warrant when no property is taken.

As far as - I have the

15

text of Rule 41 in front of me.

16

the warrant when you've taken property.

17

word in this that I can see about leaving the warrant when

18

you haven't taken property.

It talks about leaving
There's not one

19

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's correct, Your Honor, and

20

that's the - the real problem in this - in this case, when

21

if - if there is no duty to leave a warrant, as suggested

22

by the - the United States in their - their brief when no

23

property is taken, then it's the invitation to abuse that

24

I - I talked about earlier.

25

QUESTION: Well, but do you - do you have to - do

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

you have to maintain that position to win your case?

2

mean, do you have to get us to accept your - that - that

3

proposition in order to win your case?

4

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No.

I

I think the plain language

5

of the particularity requirement is all that is needed and

6

this does not meet the particularity requirement.

7

QUESTION: Can we get back to the question I

8

think that you hadn't completed your answer to before?

9

So, assuming that there is a violation of the Fourth

10

Amendment, what harm to this family - I mean, the contrast

11

with Bivens in that regard is stark, because the - the -

12

what you recited, the same thing would happen if the

13

warrant had copied the right paragraph of the application.

14

There was no rough stuff.

15

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: The damage is the fact that

16

their constitutional right to have a - a properly executed

17

and a properly written warrant prior to the invasion of

18

the home.

19

QUESTION: So -

20

QUESTION: Of course, that's really not what the

21

Fourth Amendment says, is it?

22

you need - you need - I mean, surely there's some play in

23

the joints, isn't there?

24

prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, right?

25

It just - it doesn't say

It's - it categorically

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Correct.

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

And then it goes on to say, and any

2

warrants, you know, where you need a warrant shall

3

particularly describe the - the person or place to be

4

searched and the items to be seized.

5

categorically that you can't - you need a warrant all the

6

time, so there's some play in the joints.

7

say that at least in this case where there was a good-

8

faith attempt to get a warrant and where the affidavit

9

would have justified a warrant, it is not the one thing

But it doesn't say

Why couldn't we

10

that the Fourth Amendment prohibits, an unreasonable

11

search and seizure, to go ahead with this defective

12

warrant?

13

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because there was no effort on

14

the part of Agent Groh to comply with that particular

15

requirement, and that leads to the opportunity for abuse

16

because he - there is no evidence in the - in the record

17

to show that he had any - did anything to comply - to see

18

that he had a warrant that met the particularity

19

requirement.

20

QUESTION: But - but there's nothing in the

21

Fourth Amendment that requires a warrant, even for the

22

entry into a home, and as you know of, many entries into

23

homes are done without a warrant when there are exigent

24

circumstances.

25

an unreasonable search and seizure, why can you not say it

Now, if - if you can say that that is not

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

is not an unreasonable search and seizure to proceed on

the basis of a warrant that has a - a technical - clear

3

technical defect, but nonetheless was sought and - and

4

would have issued in perfect conformity with

5

constitutional requirements.

6

unreasonable search and seizure?

7

it a search and seizure without a proper warrant as

8

defined in Article IV - in the Fourth Amendment - but the

9

Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant all the time.

10

Why does that make it an
I can see that it makes

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: It does not require a warrant

11

all the time if there are exigent circumstances.

12

were no exigent circumstances in this case.

13

There

QUESTION: Well, that's not the only exception.

14

I mean, that's one exception that - that we've developed.

15

Why can't we say another exception is where you've done

16

everything that is necessary to get a warrant, and the

17

warrant you've gotten, yeah, it doesn't really comply with

18

the description of the warrant there, but still to proceed

19

that way is not unreasonable search and seizure?

20

mistaken but it's not an unreasonable search and seizure.

21

It's

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Because I think the - that

22

would trivialize the - the requirement of the

23

particularity clause, because particularity as well as

24

probable cause weigh into the - the general warrant

25

situation and -

QUESTION: Are you - you suggesting that maybe it

was unreasonable?

circumstances this warrant could have been executed the

4

next day for as far as we know from this record, to go

back and say, oh my goodness, look at this, it's a general

6

warrant, I better get it particularized.

8
9

Since there were no exigent

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That - that's correct, and he he should have done that, because the - the problem here
is that there was - it was plain for everyone to see.

10

This was the - the Leon - the warrant that was envisioned

11

in Leon that was so facially valid that no reasonable

12

officer could rely on it -

13

QUESTION: With respect to Leon, Mr. Cordray

14

urged that if you would meet the good-faith exception, in

15

any case where the good-faith exception would apply so the

16

evidence isn't suppressed, the officer would have

17

qualified immunity.

18

equation?

19

Do you agree that that's a - a proper

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Only if there is good faith

20

that the officer attempted to comply with the

21

particularity requirement, because if there was good faith

22

that there was probable cause, that does not supply the

23

particularity any more than the oath and affirmation to

24

say that this was oath and affirmation.

particularity requirement is one of those.

2

QUESTION: May I ask you a question about the -

3

QUESTION: So what you are saying is not because

4

the - the same reason it's not a qualified immunity is the

5

same reason it isn't an unreasonable search.

6

reasonable search, isn't a reasonable search, and there is

7

no qualified immunity because he didn't even glance at the

8

document, and for the head man not to glance at the

9

document is not good faith and is unreasonable.

It isn't a

If that's

10

your argument - as I guess you're going to accept this now

11

-

12

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes.

13

QUESTION: All right, fine.

I'd like to go back

14

for one second to Justice Ginsburg's - one of her initial

15

questions, is, what is it you are seeking here?

16

in damages and an apology?

7

QUESTION: Is there any way it could be more than

because, after all, you have filed a complaint and they

10

I mean, you must have thought this through,

hired you and -

11

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, it is - yes, it is, Your

Ramirez went through by agents coming into her home and

they correctly - at least in the petitioner's brief - they

8

say that they correctly notified the homeowner about the

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That would be an oral

through oral notification, he could make up anything he

QUESTION: May I ask you another question about

9

the warrant?

Everybody's been assuming that there's only

10

one particularity requirement in the Constitution.

11

are two.

12

to be searched and also the items to be seized, and I was

13

wondering if one couldn't read this warrant as just

14

satisfying the particularity requirement with regard to

15

what was to be searched, because as I understand it, it

16

was - the ranch was a very big ranch and they only wanted

17

to search this one house with a couple of - the garage

18

next to it, and they didn't search the entire ranch, did

19

they?

20
21

There

There's the - particularly describing the place

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, they did go to search the
entire ranch.

22

QUESTION: Oh, they did?

23

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: And they did look in various

24

other buildings.

There was a statement in the affidavits

25

- in the complaint, which has not been denied that they -

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

in some ways secured - they - there was admissions in in answers -

3

QUESTION: I see.

I thought one might read the

4

warrant as describing this particular blue - blue house

5

and so forth as the particular part of the ranch that was

6

to be searched for the guns and so forth, but that's not

7

the case?

They searched everything?

8

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: Yes, that's -

9

QUESTION: I see.

10

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's correct.

11

were to - if you were to read it that it was the - to

12

search the ranch for the blue house, then -

13

But if you

QUESTION: This would be - no, I wouldn't - you

14

wouldn't obviously be searching for the blue house, but

15

you might read this as having confined the search to the

16

blue house as opposed to the entire ranch, which is

17

described - but you - but that - that wasn't done.

18

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: No.

19

QUESTION: So then it is really nonsensical on

20
21
22
23

its face.
MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's the position that we've
taken all along.
QUESTION: Well, so far as damages are concerned,

24

I suppose your claim is analogous to a common law

25

trespass, that someone has come on the - come on your

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

property without any right to do so, and so you - you

2

could analogize that to whatever damages you could get for

3

a trespass.

4

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That would be correct, Your

5

Honor.

6

- since the - the motion to dismiss was - was granted and

7

we've been arguing the - the points of law.

8
9

We - we haven't thought about damages in - in your

QUESTION: But I thought you did make some kind
of enumeration.

You mentioned Mr. Ramirez's drafting

10

table was broken and you said she was frightened, and I

11

think one other thing you alleged.

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That's - that damage would have

fact that the search was done and there was no - since the

21

search was under a illegal warrant, we contend that the

22

search was illegal and any damages coming through from the

23

illegal search are compensable, but that's to be decided

24

down - down the road.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD A. CORDRAY

14

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

15

In

MR. CORDRAY: Your Honor, on the qualified

16

immunity point, there is plain language in the

17

Constitution as to what the Fourth Amendment says, but

18

this Court said in Anderson v. Creighton, that is not the

19

correct approach.

20

Constitution says in the abstract.

21

in particular circumstances.

22

did move the law in specific respects, and this Court is

23

being asked to move the law and to answer questions that

24

we either open, and in fact are controverted in the lower

25

courts as we speak.

It's not at the level of what the
It's how it's applied

And here, the Ninth Circuit

Sheppard had established that you can go beyond

2

the four corners of the page of the warrant to look at

3

supporting materials when there's any kind of suitable

4

words of reference.

5

clarified since this case, in U.S. v. Vesikuru, 314 F.3d

6

1116, suitable words of reference can be that we're

7

relying on the sworn complaint to supply probable cause,

8

very similar, in fact indistinguishable, from the words of

9

reference in this warrant in this case.

The Ninth Circuit itself has

You're being

10

asked to retreat from Sheppard and to clarify when a

11

warrant can or cannot incorporate accompanying affidavit

12

materials and that's a question you're being asked to

13

answer in this case and then apply against this officer

14

retrospectively to give damages and deny qualified

15

immunity.

16

case law.

17

That's inappropriate under this Court's settled

Second, you're being asked in this case to say

18

specifically an officer has a constitutional duty to

19

proofread and re-check a warrant after it has been issued

20

by the magistrate, which this Court has never held, and

21

this Court has said in prior cases, including Illinois v.

22

Gates, that the officers' sole duty once they apply for an

23

order of authority is to execute the warrant faithfully in

24

accordance with the constraints imposed upon them.

25

McGrew moved the law in this case.

decision below in this Ramirez case moved the law further,

3

and yet the Court is being asked to deny qualified

4

immunity to this officer here.

This

As for the Leon dictum, Justice Kennedy, you

6

asked, we believe that if in fact Agent Groh had noticed

7

this error, if anyone had called it to his attention

8

during proceeding to execute the search, the more

9

reasonable course of conduct would be to stop and seek

10

clarification from the court, as the officers did in

11

Maryland v. Garrison.

12

having gone ahead and executed the warrant in good faith,

13

having executed the search in compliance with the request

14

made to the court, that is good faith and -

15

Having not noticed the error,

QUESTION: Would they have had a duty to turn

16

around if they'd noticed the error 5 minutes before they'd

17

come to the property?

18

MR. KOZAKIEWICZ: That is a debatable question.

19

I think that the better approach would have been to stop

20

at that moment and seek clarification from the court since

21

there were no exigent circumstances.

22

officer had not noticed the error, the magistrate had not

23

noticed the error, no one on the team had noticed the

24

error.
