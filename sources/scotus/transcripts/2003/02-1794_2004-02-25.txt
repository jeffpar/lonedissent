CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We'll hear argument now

Ms. Blatt.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
Customs officials have the responsibility to

11

protect the Nation's borders against the entry of dangerous

12

or unwanted items.

13

sovereign necessity, customs officials have historically had

14

the power to open containers and conduct a thorough search

15

of items without a warrant, probable cause, or any

16

particularized suspicion.

17
18

Consistent with that fundamental and

QUESTION: Well, now in this case, I suppose the
Government did have reasonable suspicion.

19

MS. BLATT: That's correct, but we did not rely on

20

it and the evidence was suppressed on -- based on the Ninth

21

Circuit's rule that a gas tank cannot be removed and opened

22

without reasonable suspicion.

23

QUESTION: Can you make us, i.e., I'm not saying

24

this pejoratively, but can this Court be required to decide

25

what might be a hypothetical question, it seems to me, the

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

dog barked and therefore they had grounds for thinking their

2

were drugs in the gas tank, and he kicked the gas tank and

3

it was hollow, and no one disputes those facts.

4

want to decide -- us to decide this case, as does the other

5

side, as if those facts didn't exist.

6

a hypothetical question, almost in the direction of an

7

advisory opinion.

8

didn't exist?

9

But you

It sounds to me like

What would we have decided if those facts

But they do.

So how does that work?

MS. BLATT: Well, I don't think it's an advisory

10

opinion in that the evidence has been suppressed.

11

Justice Breyer, let me directly answer your question on why

12

the case is here.

13

Constitution is violated if customs officials remove and

14

open a gas tank without reasonable suspicion, and in that

15

case there was reasonable suspicion, making the case very

16

difficult to challenge.

17

But,

In 2002, the Ninth Circuit held that the

The Government legitimately wanted to challenge

18

the case in a -- in a -- in a case where the officers

19

actions could not be subject to a potential Bivens liability

20

for violating the clearly established law of the Ninth

21

Circuit.

22

Ninth Circuit's decision as posing an immediate and present

23

danger to their ability to protect the border, and they

24

thought it imperative to try to challenge a -- bring up a

25

case that challenged that rule as soon as possible.

At the same time, customs officials viewed the

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

5

1

So two weeks after the Ninth Circuit's decision

2

was decided, respondent drove across -- drove across the

3

border with a gas tank full of 80 pounds of marijuana, and

4

the Government, we think legitimately, told the district

5

court, and there was no secret at any time in this case,

6

including at the petition stage, that we were not going to

7

put on evidence that there was reasonable suspicion, even

8

though the dog alerting and the solid-sounding tap of the

9

gas tank, we could have established or presumably could have

10
11

established that that was reasonable suspicion.
And both the district court and the Ninth Circuit

12

summarily affirmed the -- suppressed it and then affirmed

13

the suppression, because there was not reasonable suspicion,

14

and that's why this case is here.

15

this case as a threat to their ability to deter and detect

16

smuggling at a container that is relatively large and that

17

is commonly used -- in fact, it is the most common container

18

used along the Mexican border -­

The customs officials see

19

QUESTION: Can we go back to your -­

20

MS. BLATT: -- to conceal contraband.

21

QUESTION: You gave a Bivens justification for what

22

is extraordinary.

23

for us to decide it on your basis, but still, this Court

24

deals with concrete cases with actual facts and not with

25

abstract questions.

I mean, it's not a violation of article 3

So is it -- is it your notion -- is it

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

6

1

correct that what the Ninth Circuit says becomes clearly

2

established law so that an officer would genuinely be -- be

3

subject to Bivens liability when this Court hasn't addressed

4

the question?

5

MS. BLATT: No, but we didn't want to have to tell

6

the men and women who were in charge of enforcing the border

7

that they should be subject to a potential suit, at least

8

being named in their personal capacity in a lawsuit.

9

seemed more appropriate from our perspective to try to bring

It

10

a case as soon as possible where we think we could have

11

proven reasonable suspicion, but it squarely fit within the

12

Ninth Circuit's rule that reasonable suspicion was required.

13

QUESTION: I suppose you could also say it's a

14

question of resources.

15

to put on witnesses, get officers up from the border, have

16

them sit in court, go through the motion to suppress, so

17

that you have a very real interest simply in expediting

18

trial procedures by taking the course you did.

19

if that helps you on this article 3 problem or -­

20

The Government does not want to have

I don't know

MS. BLATT: It -- it helps to explain why we

21

thought there was a paramount interest in getting the case

22

as soon as possible.

23

away from the border into having to prove our reasonable

24

suspicion.

25

terms of trying to prove reasonable suspicion when we search

We didn't want to divert resources

In fact, there's already been serious fallout in

gas tanks, because the Ninth Circuit has said that all of

2

our discovery on how we train our dogs has to be produced,

3

and this is extremely sensitive information.

4

QUESTION: This is a -- I wasn't doubting the

5

Government's motive here.

motive, though maybe Bivens, maybe it was a little

overconcerned about the Bivens, maybe it wasn't.

I'm interested in is the law.

But what

That is, this isn't the first

decide this issue.

14

facts that everyone agrees are there.

I'm sure they would.

QUESTION: Have you ever looked this up?

18

Are there

any -- have you come across this kind of a problem?
MS. BLATT: I think it's -- it's clearly an -- as

19

Justice Ginsburg said, it's not an article 3 problem.

20

me say, Justice Breyer, there's no finding that there was

21

reasonable suspicion, nor do we put on any evidence that

22

would have permitted that.

that there reasonable suspicion?
MS. BLATT: There's no finding, Justice Scalia.

It

is our position that we could have put on proof that this

24

constituted reasonable suspicion by putting the dog's

25

handler on and the agent explaining what a -- what a solid-

We didn't do that, so there's no

titled to discovery on that so that the -- the handler.

let me just say, Justice Breyer, as a prudential matter, I

to take apart of a car to make a search?

we look at how easy it is to remove a gas tank and look at

Does that enter

Does that matter?
MS. BLATT: Well, it might matter, but it certainly

doesn't matter where the -- the compartment or container in

25

mechanics.

4

QUESTION: To take it off and put it back?

5

MS. BLATT: Well, in this case it took under a half

6

an hour, but, Justice O'Connor, I want to stress that in

7

other cases, depending on the type of car, it might take an

8

hour or two hours, and the last thing we want is our customs

9

official to be on a Fourth Amendment stopwatch and telling

10

the mechanic to rush.

11

So they need -­

QUESTION: On the 25 percent figure, you say 25

12

percent of all seizures from vehicles?

13

percent of seizures where you search the person or?

Does that include 25

14

MS. BLATT: No, it's 20 -­

15

QUESTION: What's -- the 25 percent is a percentage

16
17

of what?
MS. BLATT: Twenty-five percent of narcotics

18

seizures in terms of amount of seizures along land borders.

19

That doesn't include seaports -­

20

QUESTION: Oh, 25 percent in terms of quantity?

21

MS. BLATT: In terms of number of seizures.

It

22

doesn't necessarily mean how much volume, but it's a lot,

23

given that the gas tank is one of the largest containers.

24

QUESTION: But included in that base is seizures

25

from the person where somebody has it in their pocket and so

forth?

2

MS. BLATT: Yes, that's correct, but -­

3

QUESTION: Well, the gas tank here had 80 pounds in

4

it, didn't it?

5

MS. BLATT: Eighty pounds of marijuana with five

6

gallons of gas, and that's an enormous amount, and this

7

could have been another -- another -- other dangerous items,

8

it doesn't have to be just marijuana.

9

all.

And they have seen it

At the same time, someone does not store personal

10

effects in their gas tank.

11

And this involved far less of an intrusion on privacy

12

interest than the type of searches that can happen and do

13

happen at the border, such as the traveler's baggage and the

14

passenger compartments in the vehicle.

15

It's just a repository for fuel.

QUESTION: May I ask of you if the Government has

16

procedures in place for the cases in which inadvertently

17

they damage the car or -- or maybe the thing might blow up

18

on some occasion or something like that?

19

remedy does the citizen or the maybe an alien or the citizen

20

have in that situation?

21

What -- what's

MS. BLATT: Any time there's damage to any types of

22

property at the border, the person is handed a claims form,

23

which is processed through customs, first under the Federal

24

Tort Claims Act.

25

arising out of the tension of properties by customs under 28

Now, there's an exemption for claims

12

U.S.C. 2680(c), but assuming that happens, customs can pay,

2

and does pay, up to $1,000 under the Small Claims Act, under

3

31 U.S.C. 3723.

4

statute, a customs-specific statute, 19 U.S.C. 1630, that

5

would permit customs to pay up to $50,000, but the

6

restriction is for -- it has to be for non-commercial

7

properties, so that would be personal property that customs

8

damage.

And Justice Stevens, there's another

So there's -­

9

QUESTION: I would think there are a lot of cases,

10

repair bills are getting pretty expensive now, where $1,000

11

wouldn't cover it, the damage to a car.

12
13
14

MS. BLATT: Well, that may be, Your Honor, but this
case doesn't involve claim of damage and -­
QUESTION: No, I just -- but it's -- it's sort of

15

in the background as we're asking whether it's reasonable in

16

the -- in the -- in an ultimate sense, and I just -- that's

17

one of the things that I'm concerned about is -­

18

MS. BLATT: Well, sure, a gas tank is about $100,

19

$200 item, and it's conceivable that any search can result

20

in damage.

Now, respondent has never claimed -­

21

QUESTION: You mean to repair it or to replace it?

22

MS. BLATT: Well, you're right.

23
24
25

You could have -­

you could have -­
QUESTION:

When you say $100, to reconnect it,

it's about $100?

13

1

MS. BLATT: That's right.

You would -- no, the

2

item itself probably costs under $200, but you would have

3

labor costs.

4

QUESTION: Well, that's not true.

5

to get one, and it's quite expensive, I can tell you.

I recently had

6

(Laughter.)

7

MS. BLATT: Well, depending on the car, the ones

8

I've seen have been under $200, but you would have

9

associated labor costs and maybe other parts.

But the basic

10

point is that this is a container, it's a paradigmatic type

11

of item that can be opened up by the -- at the border

12

without any particularized suspicion.

13

And -­

QUESTION: Ms. -- Ms. Blatt, may I just go back

14

before you go on with your argument to follow up on Justice

15

Stevens' question?

16

for damage or, I guess, destruction of non-commercial

17

property.

18

assume it would mean, that a truck or lorry that is driven

19

as a -- as a carrier would not be covered, damage to that

20

would not be covered by the $50,000 coverage?

21

MS. BLATT: That's right.

22

QUESTION: So if the -- if the -- if the truck, I

You spoke of the $50,000 limit as being

Does -- does the non-commercial mean, as I would

And property is -­

23

mean, if the commercial truck catches fire as a result

24

because there's a spark in the gas tank and everything goes

25

up in flames, in effect there's no redress?

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

14

1

MS. BLATT: Well, I don't know too many commercial

2

importers that don't have insurance that would cover damage

3

by customs, but the important thing is -­

4
5

QUESTION: No, but the customs isn't going to pay
for it.

6

MS. BLATT: Customs is not going to pay for that.

7

QUESTION: But this would happen in a -­

8

MS. BLATT: But -­

9

QUESTION: -- reasonable search too, wouldn't it?

10

MS. BLATT: Excuse me?

11

QUESTION: I'm -- this would happen in a search

12

where there is probable cause as well, it could happen,

13

couldn't it?

14

suspicion, the same thing could happen, couldn't it?

15

you also wouldn't have to pay for the truck?

When there's -- when there's reasonable
And

MS. BLATT: Well, that -- that's absolutely true,

18

QUESTION: Right, and you would also -­

QUESTION: And that would -- and that would not

20

render what was otherwise a reasonable search unreasonable,

21

would it?

22

MS. BLATT: It would depend.

As long -- assuming

23

they're acting reasonably in carrying out the search, it's

24

still reasonable and -­

25

QUESTION: The mere fact that there's no

15

1

compensation for actual damage, accidental damage to -- to

2

the truck would not render the reasonable search

3

unreasonable if there were suspicion, right?

4

MS. BLATT: That's correct.

5

QUESTION: And the reason -­

6

QUESTION: So why should it do it here?

7

MS. BLATT: There have been thousands of

disassemblies at the border -­
QUESTION: But isn't -- isn't the point that in -­

10

in the -- in the hypothetical that Justice Scalia puts, with

11

the probable cause, we start with the assumption that the

12

offices are in there acting reasonably.

this case is posed by Justice Stevens' question.

14

potential for damage -- is it reasonable to go in there in

15

the first place without probable cause?

16

different issue, isn't it?

17

The question in
Would the

So that is a

MS. BLATT: Well, no, I think it's reasonable to

18

search property at the border by virtue of the fact it's at

19

the border, and given the Government's overriding interest

20

and the person's reduced expectations.

21

there has been no known or reported instance of this

22

hypothetical risk materializing at the border with respect

23

to a customs search.

24
25

But Justice Souter,

QUESTION: Ms. Blatt, you mentioned, you started to
give a number, 1,000 searches, fuel tank searches, and then

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

16

1

you gave a number earlier about how many gas tanks turned

2

out to have contraband or something.

3

percentage of those gas tanks were -- was there disassembly

4

and what percentage were done by a less intrusive means by

5

the dog and the tapping on the fuel tank?

6

Do you know what

MS. BLATT: Well, all gas tank seizures, which

7

there have been thousands, have to be done by removal and

8

disassembly of the tank.

9

searches, because that's what they are, of gas tanks that

There are, you could call them

10

don't involve removal and disassembly, if you use

11

sophisticated equipment such as density busters and X-rays.

12

But all these seizures that are occurring at the border, in

13

order to get to the drugs, you have to unscrew the bolts

14

that are holding the tank to the undercarriage of the

15

vehicle and remove the tank and open it up.

16

QUESTION: Is the practice then to just go straight

17

to that procedure and skip the dog and the tapping, or do

18

they go through the whole thing?

19

MS. BLATT: Well, they have dogs at all the major

20

ports of entry, but the dogs don't always alert, so I

21

wouldn't say it's necessarily skipping, but the dog may not

22

alert.

5

have that, presumably they try that first, and if it's

blocked, then they put the car up on a lift and unscrew the

metal bolts that are holding them that -- to the metal

8

straps that are holding the tank and they'll remove the

9

tank.

10

It's an extremely expensive

It costs $16,000 per unit.

But if they

And then from there on it's pretty straightforward on

how to open up the tank.

11

QUESTION: But if we -- if you prevail in this case

where the procedure imposes only a modest intrusion on

take -- to call the mechanic, pay for the mechanic to take

just not sure whether that gas tank has been altered.

a bolt looks different than another bolt or it looks like

back and see that there have been 10,000 searches and

MS. BLATT: Yes, they keep statistics on seizures

of narcotics and what are known as positive and negative

seizures.

23

their drugs, and what type of evidence they may leave

10

behind, and that's what the agent is looking for.

QUESTION: So, for example, you have a customs

20

agent whose experience leads him to believe that parents

with small children are more likely to be smuggling heroin.

8

MS. BLATT: Yeah, it's about -- cost runs about a

9

cost of $90 to $140 per visit, but Justice Scalia, there are

10

also, very consistent with your point, hundreds of cars in a

QUESTION: Does that mean, for example, that you

2

could rip out all the upholstery because you can hide drugs

4

MS. BLATT: Well, ripping out the upholstery would

first present a question of what kind of intrusion there is

MS. BLATT: That's our -- that would be our

position, but I'm saying it also involves a very distinct

factor, and that is that there's a deprivation of a

significant property interest if the item is going to be

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

MR. HUBACHEK: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:
The Court's decision in Montoya established that

6

for a search other than the routine border search,

reasonable suspicion was required.

QUESTION: Well, Mr. -- Mr. Hubachek, Montoya
discussed that in the context of a search of the person.

It

-- it said we reserve judgment on whether a strip search of

his body --- it was talking about people, not gas tanks.

12

MR. HUBACHEK: Absolutely, Mr. Chief Justice, but

13

four courts of appeals have unanimously applied the analysis

14

in Montoya to searches of property or effects under the

15

Fourth Amendment.

what we're supposed to do about it is to use the methods

interest on their side and no privacy interest and very

things that I've just mentioned.

1

MR. HUBACHEK: Right.

Well, people who smuggle

2

drugs in gas tanks are willing to take a lot of risks, but

3

the average traveler who comes to the border and is faced

4

with the possibility of random disassembly of their gas tank

5

is not going to be willing to take those risks.

6

QUESTION: Well, how -- how often does that happen

7

that an innocent person has his gas tank person random -­

8

randomly disassembled?

9

MR. HUBACHEK: Well, there's -- one of the

10

weaknesses of this record is -- is that although the customs

11

service claims that it's important for them to be able to do

12

random disassemblies, they haven't established any sort of

13

program under which they do random disassemblies, but there

14

were several hundred gas tank disassemblies in which there

15

were no drugs found.

supports the notion that when they act upon suspicion and

upon those suspicions.

2

They're -- they're talking about -- I -- I think -- I think

Ms. Blatt said hunches.

there are just some intuitions that agents get that may not

articulable suspicion, and they shouldn't -- they shouldn't

have to worry about whether they have to prove that or not.

there's no reason whatever to do it?

it's easy to observe somebody who's abusing the system, it

important though that officers not be able to act

about that that would -- would support it.

there's going to be some inconvenience any time you cross a

really a Fourth Amendment factor?

Certainly

we've talked about, the potential diminution in value, the

the privacy interest is much stronger in what we already say

MR. HUBACHEK: I -- I agree that the suspicion -­

that the privacy interest in the gas tank is not as high as

the other items that you've mentioned.

17

true that when you put your Gucci shoes on, you're planning

18

to take them off, so if an officer takes them off to look at

them, that's not a problem.

that random searches or disassemblies of gas tanks would be

at all effective.

disapproved the process of pulling over people randomly to

MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that -- I think that

there -- at least with the every 15 cars, there would be

more of a deterrent because then they would know that every

It's not demonstrated to be effective here.

QUESTION: But -- but you just can't transplant a
case involving a car on a highway inland to the border.
MR. HUBACHEK: No, I understand.

My point is -- is

that the empirical evidence was important in the Delaware v.

10

Prouse case, and that's how this Court distinguished it in

search of any container that might include the object of the

5

MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I -- I think that -­

6

QUESTION: Now, why isn't that applicable here?

7

MR. HUBACHEK: I think that it -- actually, it's

8

consistent with our position, because the statutes that Ross

9

was talking about were the statutes from 1789 and 1790 that

10

I was referring to earlier, and what they allowed was the

11

customs officers to go on board the ships to mark things and

12

to make their records and so on and so forth, and then the

13

packages would then be opened by the customs officer, and

14

the first Congress thought this was a very significant act,

15

because not only did they require the customs officer to

16

open up the packages, but they had to have two reputable

17

witnesses, merchants outside the customs service, to observe

18

those.

19
20

So that was a very significant event.
But nothing in those statutes allowed disassembly

of vessels.

all of the abilities they have to bring to bear on that, all

inside?

If -- if I

MR. HUBACHEK: Yes, they can, and that would be

consistent with the 1790 statute, which said that you could

that I'm drawing is -- is the line that was drawn by the

first Congress when they said that you can open up packages

10

and they didn't provide any additional authority on board

MR. HUBACHEK:

QUESTION: Yeah, but you're -- you're arguing a

constitutional restriction here.

16

not that Congress has not provided the authority.

Your

argument is Congress can't provide the authority.

So what,

18

it seems to me what Justice Souter is asking is, if Congress

19

can provide the authority to uncrate the statue, what

20

constitutional prohibition is there to uncrating the gas

21

tank?

22

Your -- your argument is

MR. HUBACHEK: Well, of course, in their brief, the

23

Solicitor Generals argued that that statute is -- does go

24

along with the constitutional protection, so I think that

the fact that the same Congress that passed the Fourth

And they were also

the difference in principle for constitutional purposes

7

between opening up, disassembling my crate, and

disassembling the gas tank?

9

think of is, based on what you've said so far, is the

disclose it to a subsequent purchaser, or the emissions

The Government offered no evidence below that

QUESTION: Yeah, but those -- those cases it didn't
involve gas tanks, if I understand correctly.
MR. HUBACHEK: That's -- that's correct.

They

11

didn't involve gas tanks, but they involved vehicles, and

12

basically the theory was is that if smugglers -­

13

QUESTION: May I -- may I ask you a hypothetical?

14

Supposing Congress passed a statute specifically authorizing

15

gas tank searches and providing in the statute that after

16

the search shall be conducted, the -- there will be two

17

people on hand, one, Mr. Goodwrench, and one Mr. Value

18

Appraiser, and they would have to give a good certificate,

19

both of them have to give a certificate that the value of

20

the car has not been impaired by what has been happened, and

21

if it has, the amount of value will be reimbursed

22

immediately by the Government to the owner.

23

constitutional statute?

24
25

Would that be a

MR. HUBACHEK: Well, I think that, you know, since
ultimately we're talking about reasonableness, that would

address some of the objections that I've made today, but I

2

still think -­

4

QUESTION: Would it -- would it cure enough of them
to be constitutional is the question?

5

MR. HUBACHEK: I don't -- I don't think that it

6

would, because I still think that that's beyond what the

7

First Congress envisioned and that's a -- our best guide to

8

what the Fourth Amendment was intended to mean.

authorize the disassembly of the ships that were coming into

They didn't

11

builders on board.

12

the packages, things that are intended to be opened, but you

13

have to have two witnesses, and if it turns out that there's

14

nothing in there, you have to -- the customs officer would

15

have to pay -­

They didn't say that, you know, if you took two ship
What they said was, you can take apart

16

QUESTION: My hypo gave you your two witnesses.

17

MR. HUBACHEK: I -- I understand, Your Honor.

18

QUESTION: If 85 percent of the people with the gas

19

tanks that were searched have the contraband, what you're

20

asking us to do is to protect the expectation of the other

21

15 percent.

22

the percentages get these high, it -- it seems to me to put

23

the exclusionary rule somewhat into question with reference

24

to the border.

25

to protect the 5 percent of the people?

I -- I suppose that's the rule, but it -- when

Suppose it was 95 percent.

Do we still have

I mean, I guess

51

that's the law.

2

MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Kennedy, there's no

3

showing that adopting the rule that we're asking for would

4

have any effect on the effect -- effectiveness of the border

5

searches.

6

the -- if you deprive them of the ability to do random

7

searches that there will be even one more person who would

8

get through.

9
10
11

There's no evidence offered below that, you know,

So I think that if they -­

QUESTION: Well, that works the other way around as
well.
MR. HUBACHEK: Well, that's true, but it would

12

still vest the absolute discretion across the border for any

13

customs inspector for no reason at all to disassemble

14

valuable property.

15

the Fourth Amendment, it's inconsistent with the Nation's

16

earliest statutes, it's even inconsistent with section 1461,

17

which applies directly to entries from contiguous countries,

18

and that -­

19

That's inconsistent with the history of

QUESTION: Well, for -- for no reason at all they

20

can -- they can conduct searches of -- of the person, right,

21

without any suspicion?

That's okay.

22

MR. HUBACHEK: That's correct.

23

QUESTION: The Gucci shoes and everything else.

24

But somehow when you -- when you reach this -- this magical,

25

what, disassembly of a vehicle, that that has some special

52

1

constitutional status.

2

I -- I find that quite implausible.

MR. HUBACHEK: Well, Justice Scalia, I think that

3

the importance is, is that it is very -- we're asking for a

4

standard that's -- comports with what was adopted in 1789

5

and 1790, and the 1461 statute that's currently applicable

6

talks about allowing the customs inspectors to look inside

7

the vehicle by providing a key, not by providing a lift or

8

providing tools, but by providing a key.

9

reasonable, that's what's routine, that's what's should be

10

That's what's

protected by the Fourth Amendment.

11

QUESTION: Do you -- do you question the -- the

12

Government gave an example, I think from fiscal year 2003.

13

They said 300 fuel tanks were disassembled and put back

14

along the southern border without incident, that is, no

15

explosion and no malfunction in the vehicles for the

16

travels.

17

MR. HUBACHEK: I don't have any additional

18

information about those.

19

violated those individuals' leases, whether they felt a lack

20

of security as was discussed in the Molina-Tarazon case,

21

whether their warranties were any way affected, they simply

22

don't have any information.

23

I mean, I don't know if that

QUESTION: But it would be a graver concern than a

24

warranty if the vehicle might blow up after.

25

there doesn't seem to be any evidence of that, that there's

And -- but

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

53

1

a high risk that that would occur.

2

MR. HUBACHEK: Well, there's no risk -- apparently

3

there's no evidence of anything blowing up, but that doesn't

4

mean that individuals' security was implicated as they drove

5

away from the border knowing that their valuable property

6

had been altered by unknown government functionaries.

7

If the Court has no further questions, I'll

8

submit.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF LISA S. BLATT

12

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13

MS. BLATT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Justice

14

Kennedy, you asked about the 25 percent figure, and in the

15

appendix to the petition at 12a, that 25 percent figure

16

relates to vehicle drug seizures, so what customs meant by

17

seizures was from the vehicle.

18

found in someone's pockets.

19

That wouldn't include stuff

Justice Breyer, you asked about how we track

20

searches.

21

system where customs tracks all of their searches, both

22

positive and negative, and when there's a positive report

23

search, it's called a seizure.

24

it's called an incident report, and the agent is in fact

25

required to document what his reasons were -- were for

There's apparently a nationwide computer tracking

When there's a negative,

conducting the search, and the supervisor must read that,

2

and if there was a problem developing about improper use of

3

his resources at the border, the agent would be either

4

trained or disciplined.

5

QUESTION: Are those public documents?

6

MS. BLATT: I would doubt it.

I don't know,

7

Justice Kennedy, but given that it includes the reasons for

8

conducting the search, but I -- I just don't know.

9

it's called the TECS, but I don't know whether that's public

10

or not.

11
12

I know

QUESTION: Is it public that such a thing exists?
Is there -­

13

MS. BLATT: I've just made it public.

14

(Laughter.)

15

QUESTION: But -- but -- I mean besides your word

16

for it.

17

cite something other than you.

I trust you implicitly, but I'd like to be able to

MS. BLATT: I -- I'd have to go -­

something else to say.

QUESTION: I just want -- I do think it's correct

2

though, is it not, that what really we're asked to decide is

3

whether you have the power to make random searches?

4

that they're costly and unlikely, but I think it -- it's --

5

it's not unlikely in today's world that you might decide you

6

want to search every one-hundredth vehicle or ever twenty-

7

fifth vehicle to let the world know that even if they hire

8

Ronald Coleman they might get searched.

9

isn't it?

10

I know

That is correct,

MS. BLATT: That's correct, Justice Stevens, and

11

it's quite conceivable if the country ever went on a red

12

alert that the commissioner of customs might say, or if

13

there was some vague intelligence about smuggling in pick-up

14

trucks, they might want to do very extensive searches of

15

pick-up trucks.

16

that I hope not, but yet, this -- the -- the border power -­

17

the power to conduct a border search is one without any

18

particularized suspicion.

Now whether they'll actually ever come to
