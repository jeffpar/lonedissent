ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. DREEBEN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. DREEBEN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it
please the Court:
Before this Court's decision in Dickerson v.

12

United States in the year 2000, it was the uniform rule in

13

the lower Federal courts that the failure to issue Miranda

14

warnings meant that the unwarned statement was not

15

admissible in the Government's case, but that there was no

16

requirement to suppress physical evidence that was derived

17

from those unwarned statements.

18

Following this Court's decision in Dickerson,

19

which affirmed that Miranda has constitutional stature,

20

the majority of the Federal courts of appeals to address

21

the issue continued to adhere to the pre-Dickerson rule

22

that physical fruits of an unwarned statement were

23

admissible.

24
25

In this case, the Tenth Circuit broke ranks with
that uniform body of authority and held that, as a result

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of Dickerson's ruling that Miranda has constitutional

2

stature, there is a derivative fruits suppression

3

component to the Miranda rule.

4

reversed.

5

That holding should be

Miranda stands as a rule that implements the

6

Fifth Amendment, not by requiring the compulsion that the

7

Amendment literally speaks of, but by providing an extra

8

level of protection for the core of the Fifth Amendment

9

right, the right for the defendant's own statements that

10

are incriminating not to be used against him in a criminal

11

trial.

12
13
14

QUESTION: Is it a Fifth Amendment right or not a
Fifth Amendment right?
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, as I understand it,

15

it is a right that implements the Fifth Amendment's

16

protection.

17

QUESTION: It - it has to be based on something

18

in the Constitution or we would have had to respect the

19

statute enacted by Congress in Dickerson.

20

there is obviously some provision of the Constitution that

21

enabled us to disregard that statute.

22

provision is that?

So it is -

What - what

23

MR. DREEBEN: The Fifth Amendment.

24

QUESTION: All right.

25

What the -

It's a Fifth Amendment

right then.

1

MR. DREEBEN: What the Court concluded in Miranda

2

and then reaffirmed in Dickerson is that the traditional

3

totality of the circumstances test for ascertaining

4

whether a statement is voluntary or has been compelled by

5

the Government is not adequate when the statements are

6

taken in the inherently pressuring environment of

7

custodial interrogation.

8

protection to avoid the violation of the defendant's Fifth

9

Amendment rights, the Court adopted a prophylactic

10
11

And to provide an extra layer of

warnings and wavier procedure.
QUESTION: Whether it's prophylactic or not, it

12

is a constitutional right, is it not?

13

constitutional right.

It is a

14

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Scalia, it is a

15

constitutional right that is distinct from the right not

16

to have one's compelled statements used against oneself.

17

QUESTION: Well, so is the constitutional right

18

not to be pistol-whipped in order to - to confess.

19

MR. DREEBEN: Well -

20

QUESTION: That's distinct from the introduction

21

of the coerced confession at trial, but we don't

22

distinguish between the two, do we?

23

MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I think you do, Justice Scalia.

24

That is a violation of the core due process right not to

25

have substantive violations of one's liberty interests.

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

What we're talking about in this case is not a substantive

2

violation of the defendant's rights, but a procedural

3

violation of the Fifth Amendment that this Court has

4

defined in Miranda, but has defined it in a way that is

5

highly distinct from the basic, textually-mandated rule of

6

the Fifth Amendment that compelled statements may not be

7

used.

8
9

QUESTION: Let me - let me take out the pistolwhipping.

It - it - it is a coerced statement because of

10

the application of mental coercion.

11

violation of the Fifth Amendment, I suppose, until the

12

product of the - of the coercion is introduced at trial.

13

Will you say the same thing?

14

Now, that is not a

MR. DREEBEN: I would - I'm not sure, Justice

15

Scalia, that your question addresses what Miranda

16

addressed.

17

which it was extremely difficult for the courts to sort

18

out whether a statement was coerced or not coerced, and to

19

avoid the risk that an actually coerced statement would be

20

used in evidence against the defendant, thus violating the

21

core Fifth Amendment right.

22

Court has later explained, adopted a presumption, a

23

presumption for a limited purpose.

24
25

What Miranda addressed was a situation in

The Miranda Court, as this

In the government -

QUESTION: May - may I ask a - a modified version
of Justice Scalia's question?

Supposing that the

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Government used official powers, such as a grand jury

2

subpoena or a congressional committee subpoena, to - to

3

get a confession out of a person under threat of contempt

4

of court, so it was clearly just a Fifth Amendment was a -

5

he made an answer that revealed the existence of the gun

6

and then he - would that be a - would the gun be

7

admissible or un - inadmissible in that scenario?

8
9
10

MR. DREEBEN: If your hypothetical, Justice
Stevens, presupposes an assertion of the Fifth Amendment
right and actual compulsion of the -

11

QUESTION: The threat of contempt, yeah.

12

MR. DREEBEN: - information, presumably under a

13

grant of immunity, then the gun would not be admissible,

14

because this Court has defined a violation of the Fifth

15

Amendment that involves actual compulsion as entailing two

16

different evidentiary consequences.

17

consequence is that the statements themselves may not be

18

used.

19

derived from the statements may be used.

20

feature of that hypothetical and its distinction from

21

Miranda, is it involves actual compulsion.

22

One evidentiary

The other evidentiary consequence is that nothing
But the critical

Miranda -

QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben - Mr. - Miranda itself

23

said, but unless and until such warnings and waivers are

24

demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence

25

obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

him, no evidence as a result of interrogation.

That

2

sounds like a - a - a derivative evidence rule to me.

3

MR. DREEBEN: It does, Justice Ginsburg, and

4

there are many things in the Miranda opinion that have not

5

stood the test of later litigation in this Court, because

6

they extended the implications of Miranda far beyond where

7

this Court has gone.

8

The rule, at the time of Miranda and today, is that if

9

there is actual compulsion, the Government may not make

And let me be precise about this.

10

use of the actual statements that are taken or their

11

evidentiary fruits.

12

statement for impeachment, and there is no public safety

13

exception that could -

14

The Government may also not use that

QUESTION: Well, how are we going to determine

15

actual compulsion if it's a situation where the police

16

knowingly engage in conversation hoping to pick up

17

information without giving the Miranda warnings, and then

18

the minute they start hearing something useful, give the

19

warnings, but then rely on what they learned earlier to

20

further that information gathering.

21

that out?

22

How - how do we parse

MR. DREEBEN: Justice O'Connor, the determination

23

of whether the statements reflect voluntariness at the

24

outset and then a knowing and - and intelligent waiver of

25

Miranda warnings later on after they are given needs to be

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

determined based on the totality of the circumstances.

2

But this Court has recognized, in allowing the

3

use of unwarned statements for impeachment and in adopting

4

the public safety exception, and in permitting a second

5

warned statement, as the Court did in Oregon v. Elstad, to

6

be admitted into evidence, notwithstanding an earlier

7

unwarned statement, that there is a difference between the

8

Miranda presumption and a finding of actual compulsion.

9

QUESTION: May I ask you - you mentioned the

10

public safety exception.

11

need a public safety exception if you're correct in this

12

case, do we?

13

We wouldn't - we really don't

MR. DREEBEN: No, we still do, because the

14

crucial thing about Miranda that is not challenged here is

15

that a failure to issue Miranda warnings, followed by

16

custodial interrogation, means that the unwarned statement

17

is inadmissible in the Government's case in chief.

18

is the core ruling of Miranda.

19

That

QUESTION: But the core ruling of the public

20

safety exception, as I remember it, is that you can use

21

the gun.

22

MR. DREEBEN: No, the core ruling of the public

23

safety exception is that you can use the statement.

The

24

Court held, in New York v. Quarles, that when pressing

25

public safety needs justify the conduct of custodial

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

interrogation without prior issuance of Miranda warnings,

2

that situation falls outside of the Miranda paradigm, and

3

the statements themselves can be used.

4

Now, Justice O'Connor's dissenting opinion

5

argued that there should be no exception for public safety

6

for the statements themselves, but the gun, as derivative

7

evidence, should come in, because it was not the product

8

of actual compulsion at which the Fifth Amendment is

9

aimed.

10

QUESTION: Mr. -

11

QUESTION: The - the difficulty that I have

12

accepting that as the final answer is that there isn't any

13

functional difference in a case like this between

14

admitting the statement, the admission that he had the gun

15

on the shelf in the bedroom, and admitting the gun.

16

that, in functional terms, the - the Miranda protection,

17

even as you describe it, disappears on your theory.

18

So

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, if - if I accept

19

that that accurately describes this case, it does not

20

accurately describe the large class of cases in which

21

physical evidence is discovered as a result of unwarned

22

statements.

23

In many -

QUESTION: Mr. Dreeben, doesn't it occur - cover

24

quite a wide number of cases?

This was a case where the -

25

the crime that the police were after were - was gun

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

possession.

2

stolen goods.

3

that the constitutional rule is that a police chief can

4

say to his officers, go in and get him to tell you where

5

the narcotics are, where the gun is, where the stolen

6

goods are?

7

want the goods.

8
9

It might be narcotics possession, it might be
And in all those situations, are you saying

We don't worry about his statement, but we

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Ginsburg, that is my
position, but I don't think it would be a prudent policy

10

for law enforcement to adopt.

11

which the Government can prove knowing possession of a

12

firearm by the defendant even without the benefit of his

13

statements, but police officers are not going to be able

14

to predict in advance that that is going to be true in the

15

vast majority of cases.

16

that if you have a statement that links the defendant to

17

the gun, that allows you to show knowing possession.

18

the absence of that, having the physical evidence alone

19

will not necessarily guarantee a conviction.

20

This case may be one in

What they are going to know is

In

QUESTION: You don't think the gun on the shelf

21

in the guy's bedroom is going to be sufficient to prove

22

knowing possession?

23
24
25

MR. DREEBEN: Oh, I do in this case, Justice
Souter.
QUESTION: You know what's in your bedroom.

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DREEBEN: I think that the Court should

2

decide this case not based on the particularities of this

3

factual scenario, but on the class of cases in which

4

physical evidence is at issue, and should regard the

5

question of what incentives the police may have as

6

informed by the totality of cases that may arise.

7

Police officers who decide to conduct custodial

8

interrogation without giving Miranda warnings know that

9

they will not be able to use the statements that the

10

defendant makes in the Government's case in chief, and

11

they have no way of knowing before they conduct custodial

12

interrogation what the defendant may say.

13

defendant offers up information that is incriminating on

14

unanticipated crimes or provides leads to information that

15

the police haven't previously anticipated, then the police

16

officers run two risks.

If the

17

The first is that they won't be able to use

18

those statements against the defendant in the case in

19

chief.

20

warnings, they increase the likelihood that a later court

21

reviewing the facts will conclude that this is not a case

22

of a mere failure to give Miranda warnings, but is a case

23

involving actual compulsion.

24

that the statements are actually compelled, involuntary -

25

QUESTION: Well, Mr. Dreeben, supposing that the

The second is that by failing to issue Miranda

And if a court concludes

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

police decide that they're going to follow this strategy

2

that is perhaps suggested by Justice Ginsburg.

3

itself be evidence of compulsion?

4

won't give Miranda warnings and see - see what the person

5

says, then they give them.

6

compulsion?

7

Would that

In other words, they

Would that be evidence of

MR. DREEBEN: It would be evidence that a

8

defendant could argue is relevant, but I don't think that

9

it would be evidence of compulsion.

What's relevant in

10

the compulsion analysis is what the police officers

11

actually say and do and communicate to the suspect.

12

uncommunicated intent or law enforcement policies would

13

not add up to compulsion by itself.

14

Their

QUESTION: If we were to reject your position and

15

- and say that this is purely a constitutional violation,

16

would you then lose the case?

17

MR. DREEBEN: No, Justice Kennedy.

The Court

18

should still do as it has done in other contexts, balance

19

the costs of a Miranda suppression remedy against whatever

20

incremental benefits there may have.

21

QUESTION: What's your -

22

QUESTION: And why - why is this different than

23
24
25

the rule under the Fourth Amendment, say Wong Sun?
MR. DREEBEN: What the Court has done in the
Fourth Amendment context is deal with an actual violation

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

of the Fourth Amendment and establish very exclusion -

2

various exclusionary rules that are designed to deter that

3

kind of police conduct.

4

different, because even if the Court holds that Miranda

5

prescribes a rule of substantive conduct for the police,

6

which we submit it does not, even if the Court were to

7

hold that, it still is a rule that merely presumes

8

compulsion.

9

compulsion.

10

The Miranda rule is very

It doesn't constitute a finding of actual

QUESTION: Well, we said last year in Chavez that

11

the Miranda - that the Constitution was not violated by

12

failure to give Miranda warnings until they were offered

13

in evidence, didn't we?

14

MR. DREEBEN: That - that is correct, Mr. Chief

15

Justice.

16

Amendment -

17
18

QUESTION: Is it correct, was there a majority to
take that position?

19
20

But what the Court has done under the Fifth

QUESTION: That was the trial court's opinion,
wasn't it?

21

QUESTION: That - that - I believe to - you're

22

taking all the opinions together.

23

for that.

24
25

There were six votes

MR. DREEBEN: I think this Court will be better
able than I am to say what Chavez held.

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. DREEBEN: But the - the reason that that

3

principle alone does not decide this case is that the

4

Court has, in instances of actual compulsion out of court,

5

applied a derivative evidence suppression rule.

6

the rule that the Court adopted in Counselman v.

7

Hitchcock, and it's followed it in its immunity line of

8

cases where it has held that to displace the Fifth

9

Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, you

10

That's

need to suppress both the statement and the fruits.

11

QUESTION: Is part of your - is - is part of your

12

reasoning that in the Fourth Amendment violation case,

13

exclusion is the - really the best available, most direct

14

remedy?

15

remedies, number one, excluding the statement, so that

16

when you - when you find tangible evidence, it's - it's

17

just a - an ancillary and less necessary remedy.

18

the whole -

And in - and in this case, there are other

Is that

19

MR. DREEBEN: That - that's -

20

QUESTION: - thrust of the argument.

21

MR. DREEBEN: That's the core of it, Justice

22

Kennedy.

What the Court did in Miranda was create a rule

23

that operates in the very heart of the Fifth Amendment by

24

creating a prophylactic buffer zone against the risk, not

25

the certainty, but the risk, that actual compulsion has

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

been exacted.

2

targets as the core concern.

3

It is that risk that the Fifth Amendment

QUESTION: What's the theory of the compulsion?

4

That is, what - why, assuming that there's compulsion but

5

there hasn't been an introduction of the statement that

6

was compelled into evidence.

7

that the compulsion doesn't rise to the level of the due

8

process violation.

9

but - but if they don't, then what's the theory of keeping

10
11

Under that - and suppose

I mean, I - maybe - maybe they all do,

out the evidence derived from that sort of compulsion.
MR. DREEBEN: Justice Breyer, as the Court

12

explained it in its immunity line of cases, the starting

13

point of analysis is that a defendant under the Fifth

14

Amendment can claim his privilege against testifying based

15

not only on incrimination from the statements that he

16

makes, but also that evidence that the Government can

17

obtain as a result of the statements is incriminating.

18

If his testimony is a link in a chain of

19

incrimination, he can stand silent, and the Court reasoned

20

from that that the Government should not be able to

21

circumvent that right of the defendant not to be a witness

22

against his - himself, by calling him out of court,

23

compelling testimony over his objection that - based on

24

the Fifth Amendment, and then obtaining the very

25

incriminating information that the privilege shielded him

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

from having to provide.

2

QUESTION: So why doesn't all that apply here?

3

mean, is - is that - I can understand it if they compel

4

the testimony, then you introduce it.

5

have the completed violation of what the Fifth Amendment

6

forbids, all right, the completed violation.

7

understand it if you compel the person to the extent that

8

it violates the Due Process Clause, beating him up

9

severely, whatever.

10

I

Then - then you

I can

Now, I don't understand why, if you have neither

11

of those two things, you would keep the evidence that's

12

the fruits out, under some theory that doesn't also say

13

you should keep this out.

14

MR. DREEBEN: Well, the - the distinction between

15

this situation and the true compulsion situation is,

16

Miranda does not involve an actual finding of compulsion,

17

and the Court has been very frank about this.

18

result, the Court has repeatedly drawn distinctions

19

between the use of unwarned statements and the use of

20

actually compelled statements.

21

statements may not be used to impeach a defendant's trial

22

testimony.

23

right.

As a

Actually compelled

That too would violate the Fifth Amendment

24

But the Court held in - in the Hass case and in

25

the Harris case that statements that are merely unwarned,

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

but not compelled, can be used for impeachment.

The Court

2

similarly held in Michigan v. Tucker and then again in

3

Oregon v. Elstad that statements that are unwarned, but

4

not compelled, can be used as leads to find another

5

witness' testimony, or to obtain a second statement from

6

the defendant himself.

And if -

7

QUESTION: So is this distinction that the - that

8

- that one case is just more egregious, more an affront to

9

the Constitution, more dangerous, i.e., physical

10

compulsion as opposed to the compulsion that's just

11

presumed from Miranda?

12

MR. DREEBEN: One case, Justice Kennedy, involves

13

a literal violation of the Fifth Amendment.

14

involves a presumption that this Court -

15
16
17

Miranda

QUESTION: Well, then - then you're back into
metaphysics.
MR. DREEBEN: It is a little metaphysical,

18

Justice Kennedy, but there's a - a pot of truth, I think,

19

a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow here, which is

20

that the Miranda presumption does not mean, this Court has

21

held, that a statement is actually compelled.

22

against the most crucial right contained in the Fifth

23

Amendment itself, which is -

24
25

It protects

QUESTION: But you don't think we should
differentiate based on the gravity of the - of the wrong

in either case?

2

MR. DREEBEN: You could look at it that - that

3

way, Justice Kennedy.

What - what the Court has done when

4

it's dealt with a - a failure to issue warnings, is

5

balance.

6

presumes compulsion in lieu of proving it, the Court has

7

taken a step beyond the core of the constitutional right

8

itself, and the Court's language in its previous cases of

9

calling Miranda warnings and the exclusionary rule under

It has recognized that, by providing a rule that

10

Miranda a prophylactic right is understandable in that

11

sense.

12

compelled under the Fifth Amendment.

Miranda excludes some statements that are not

QUESTION: May - may I ask this question, Mr.

14

Dreeben?

The - there's a distinction in - in your - you

15

submit, between a presumption of involuntariness and

16

actual involuntariness.

17

law in which we've differentiated between a presumed

18

result and an actual result?

Do you know any other area of the

19

MR. DREEBEN: I - I - I don't want to go off into

20

an excursion into rules of law that might occur to me as I

21

stand here, Justice Stevens.

22

the Court's own Miranda jurisprudence -

23

But what I do know is that

QUESTION: My understand - you're - you're -

24

there's - there's a lot in the case that support what you

25

say.

But I'm suggesting it is kind of a unique

1

development of the law, because normally I would think if

2

you presume X from Y, that would be the same as proving X.

3

MR. DREEBEN: It -

4

QUESTION: But you say that's new - that's not

5
6

true in this line of - this area of the law?
MR. DREEBEN: There is language in the Miranda

7

opinion, as Justice Ginsburg has mentioned, that would

8

support the view that the original vision of Miranda was

9

that it would constitute compulsion -

10

QUESTION: Right.

11

MR. DREEBEN: - not merely presume it.

12

the Court developed the rule and considered what the costs

13

and benefits would be of having a rule that merely

14

presumed compulsion, any context in which it was not

15

necessarily true.

16

that not all statements taken in custodial interrogation

17

without warnings are compelled.

18

a prophylactic rule, it's incumbent upon the Court to

19

balance the benefits against the burdens of the rule.

20

But as

The Miranda Court itself recognized

Once you are dealing with

QUESTION: Of course, one of the benefits of -

21

under the Miranda analysis, we will - we avoid the

22

necessity of resolving difficult issues of fact sometimes.

23

There are a lot of borderline cases to whether there

24

really was compulsion or it's just presumed.

25

to get back into that, under your view.

1

MR. DREEBEN: Well, I think the Court has put

2

itself back into it by adopting the holdings that permit

3

statements that are not warned to be used for impeachment

4

and to be used to obtain leads for other witnesses.

5

QUESTION: Well, I guess we tell juries they can

6

disregard presumptions, but they can't disregard facts.

7

MR. DREEBEN: And I think that that's what the

8

Court has really decided is the right approach when you

9

are outside the core concern that the Miranda Court was

10

addressing, namely the use of the unwarned statement

11

itself.

12

function of a criminal trial to suppress reliable,

13

physical evidence that was obtained not as the result of a

14

core constitutional violation involving literal compulsion

15

or a substantive due process violation, but merely a

16

failure to issue warnings.

17

There is a terrible cost to the truth-seeking

QUESTION: It's a terrible cost, but it's a

18

terrible cost for which the law provides a ready means of

19

avoidance.

20

There is - there's no excuse at this point in our history

21

for the police to say, gee, I - I don't quite understand

22

what Miranda is getting at.

23

to me the cost argument is a weak one -

I mean, Miranda's been around for a long time.

And - and that's why it seems

24

MR. DREEBEN: Well, I -

25

QUESTION: - and is a - let me just finish this

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

sentence.

2

to me a fairly strong argument that if you accept your

3

position, there is a, in - in effect, a recipe for

4

disregarding Miranda, because in every physical evidence

5

case, as in Justice Ginsburg's examples, there's going to

6

be an inducement to say, never mind the statement, just

7

get the evidence, the evidence will take care of the case.

8
9
10
11

And as against that weak argument, there seems

So I - it - it - it's seems to me that we got a
weak argument on one side and a strong argument on the
other side.
MR. DREEBEN: Well, there - I - the argument

12

based on cost, Justice Souter, is - is not weak, because

13

the costs are quite real.

14

evidence that's suppressed -

The jury does not hear the

QUESTION: The costs are quite real, but the

16

state knows how to avoid having to pay those costs.

18

MR. DREEBEN: This Court has repeatedly

19

recognized though that there are situations in which there

20

are ambiguities in the way that Miranda actually applies,

21

and law enforcement officers are going to make mistakes in

22

the way that they apply Miranda.

23

QUESTION: I thought the main rule was, the

24

police, when they take someone into custody, are supposed

25

to give them four warnings, and that seems to me a simple,

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

clear rule.

2

they don't have to give the warnings up front, that's

3

okay.

4

Now you - you're shifting this to say, well,

MR. DREEBEN: Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

Our

5

position is that if they don't give the warnings up front,

6

they lose the statement that is taken without warnings.

7

That is the Miranda rule, and it responds to the core

8

concern that Miranda had.

9

The question is, how much further should that

10

rule go?

11

yourself earlier, police officers do not know before they

12

get hold of evidence whether they are going to be able to

13

link it to the defendant with other admissible evidence

14

and prove the violation at trial.

off following the Miranda script, getting the admissible

16

evidence of - of the defendant's own statements, and using

it to tie the defendant to the evidence.

And, as I think I answered Justice Souter and

They are much better

And in a large

QUESTION: Then - then why do we have - if that's

20

the case, why do we have a case coming up in - in a few

21

minutes in which a - a contrary policy has been adopted?

22

I mean, it - your - your statement that - that the police

23

have much to gain and much to lose if - if - if they - if

24

they follow the practice of avoiding the warnings is - is

not intuitively clear this morning.

MR. DREEBEN: Justice Souter, I think as the

in that case acknowledged that he was rolling the dice.

4

There are many reasons why -

QUESTION: And there was a policy to roll the

MR. DREEBEN: That officer testified that he had

you smooth the path to admissibility of the evidence, you

ensure that the warned statements are admissible.

The FBI policy has been, even before

You avoid difficult voluntariness inquiries,

QUESTION: No, I - I'm - I'm sure that that is

17

the FBI policy, but it - the point is, there is a

18

substantial, apparently a substantial body of thought

19

outside the FBI within American law enforcement that dice-

20

rolling pays off.

21

MR. DREEBEN: Well, it - I think that in many

cases it pays off with risks that responsible law

enforcement officers often choose not to run.

Ms. Wichlens, we'll hear from you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JILL M. WICHLENS

3

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

4
5
6

MS. WICHLENS: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin by responding to the

7

Government's argument that Miranda warnings are not a

8

requirement, they may be simply a matter of proving

9

policy, but are not a requirement.

Just three terms ago,

10

this Court reaffirmed in Dickerson that - and I'm quoting

11

from Dickerson - Miranda requires procedures that will

12

warn a suspect in custody of his right to remain silent,

13

which will assure the suspect that the exercise of that

14

right will be honored.

15

QUESTION: Yeah, but I think, Ms. Wichlens, if

16

you read through the entire opinion in Dickerson, it's

17

clear that the warnings are required in order to make the

18

statements admissible.

19

to give the warnings without seeking to follow up with

20

admission is a constitutional violation.

21

They don't say that mere failure

MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor, but in

22

this case they are seeking to admit the evidence.

So if

23

there are two components to a Miranda violation, one being

24

the violation in the field by the police officer, the

25

second component is admitting the evidence at trial, and

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that is exactly what the Government is attempting -

2

QUESTION: Well, is - isn't this a fruits case?

3

MS. WICHLENS: It is a fruits case, Your Honor.

4

QUESTION: It's not the statement.

5

MS. WICHLENS: Correct.

6

QUESTION: It is - it is derivatively obtained

7

information.

8

MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, absolutely.

9

QUESTION: Which might make a difference to you.

10

MS. WICHLENS: It could make a difference, and -

11

QUESTION: At least I've thought so.

12

MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor, and

13

following up on a question asked by Justice Kennedy,

14

whether, if this is a constitutional violation, the

15

derivative evidence rule, the fruits rule, would apply.

16

And my answer to that is yes, absolutely, under Wong Sun.

17

If this is a constitutional violation, it would apply in

18

Chavez, just -

19

QUESTION: Well, what - what's the magic about

20

that metaphysical rule when we're talking about a

21

different amendment and a different kind of statement or a

22

different kind of - a different kind of evidence than is

23

in the - than the rule itself was designed for primarily?

24

I mean, I don't know why we're just bound by that

25

metaphysical rule.

1

MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, I'm speaking of Wong

2

Sun for the general proposition that when we have a

3

constitutional violation, turning to the Fifth Amendment

4

specifically, the amendment that we're, of course,

5

concerned with here.

6

plurality opinion in Chavez made it clear that if we have

7

a violation of the Fifth Amendment, then application of

8

the derivative evidence rule is virtually automatic.

9

In Chavez, a plurality - the

Now, my argument doesn't rest entirely on the

10

argument that this is a constitutional violation.

11

first position is that, if it is, it's an automatic

12

application of the derivative evidence rule.

13

it is not, then we go to a balancing and we balance the

14

costs, the benefits of applying a derivative evidence

15

rule.

16

My

But even if

QUESTION: Why - why would there be any cost here

17

to anything if you took the position, as we might take,

18

that if a policeman goes in and purposely doesn't give the

19

warnings when he knows that he should, or even if he

20

reasonably should know and doesn't, we're not going to let

21

in derivatives.

22

MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor -

23

QUESTION: But in the unusual case, we're quite -

24

it was an honest mistake, as it could be here, because he

25

tried to give the warnings and the defendant said, no, no,

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

I know what they are, okay.

2

there?

3

So - so what cost, if - if -

MS. WICHLENS: Justice Breyer, we need a bright

4

line in this area of the law.

5

always applied bright lines, particularly in the area of a

6

Miranda violation.

7

This Court has virtually

QUESTION: Well, we've had - we've had, Ms.

8

Wichlens, probably somewhere between 40 and 50 cases since

9

Miranda was decided, deciding was this interrogation or

10

was it not, was this custody or was it not.

11

factual disputes about every single aspect of Miranda.

12

There are

MS. WICHLENS: I think Your Honor's cases, which

13

were, particularly in the early years following Miranda,

14

have now made those rules quite clear what is

15

interrogation, what is custody -

16

QUESTION: Well, we - we apply in this area, as

17

regrettably in a lot of others, what we call the totality

18

of the circumstances test.

19

line?

Do you call that a bright

20

MS. WICHLENS: Well -

21

QUESTION: It seems to me the fuzziest of all

22
23

lines.
MS. WICHLENS: For the voluntariness

24

determination, it is a fuzzy totality of the

25

circumstances, but no, in Miranda, we apply bright lines

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

determining whether there was interrogation, whether there

2

was custody.

3

individual police officers -

4

We don't try to get inside the head of the

QUESTION: Well, the brightest line, it seems to

5

me, would be if the policeman knew or should have known

6

that he was supposed to give a warning, fine, the evidence

7

stays out.

8

MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor -

9

QUESTION: But now all we're excluding, we're

10

just letting in evidence in those cases where it genuinely

11

is fuzzy and no policeman knows what he's supposed to do,

12

or - or it's at least reasonable for him not to know.

13

Now, under those circumstances, what you do is lose

14

evidence, lose evidence that could be useful in convicting

15

a criminal, and what you gain is precisely nothing, since

16

the policeman, by definition, was confused about the

17

matter and reasonably so.

18

Now, what's the answer to that?

MS. WICHLENS: The answer to that is, drawing

19

that bright line, if it is one, Your Honor, I think does

20

require us to get inside the head of the police officer.

21

It requires us to make determinations about whether it was

22

reasonable or not.

23

mixed motives.

An individual police officer may have

We're not giving -

24

QUESTION: We're - we're - we're saying whether a

2

MS. WICHLENS: If -

QUESTION: Just as - just as you say, you say for

4

custody we apply a bright line.

5

line for custody.

6

whether a - a reasonable person would have believed, given

7

the totality of the circumstances, that he was free to

leave.

9

We don't apply a bright

The test for custody is whether -

MS. WICHLENS: Perhaps, Your Honor, I -

10

QUESTION: That - that is anything but bright.

11

MS. WICHLENS: Perhaps I shouldn't say bright

12

line.

13

what I urge this Court not to do is impose a subjective

14

test, which requires us to get inside the head of the

15

police officer.

16
17

What I mean is objective versus subjective, and

QUESTION: Okay.

Well, we can apply objective -

an objective test then.

18

MS. WICHLENS: Under an -

19

QUESTION: If a reasonable police officer in the

20

position of this police officer would - would have been

21

confused about the necessity of giving a Miranda warning,

22

then you're - we're at a different situation.

23

MS. WICHLENS: And if it is an objective test,

24

Justice Scalia, then in this case the police officer fails

25

that test.

Didn't the

suspect here say, don't give me that warning, I know what

3

my rights are, I know about that.

4

MS. WICHLENS: The record shows that the

detective said, you have the right to remain silent.

6

Patane said, I know my rights.

7

this is the most crucial thing - is the detective not only

didn't go on to read the other very critical Miranda

He didn't -

because it seems to me you could have one simple rule

I'm just tying - trying it out for all these

cases.

You say if the policeman knew or reasonably should

have known, well, we're talking about derivative evidence,

not - not the evidence itself, but derivative - knew or

concerned, what - what difference does it make to him

whether the officer's failure to give the warnings was

intentional or just negligent?

15

MS. WICHLENS: No difference whatsoever, Your

Honor, none whatsoever.

The suspect is still not informed

of his constitutional rights.

brighter line, a simpler test, if you will, Your Honor, is

more appropriate.

That's why I believe a

argument?

Is it not correct, as your opponent argued in

MS. WICHLENS: My response to that, Your Honor,

8

is I think the lower courts have been mistaken.

decision, of course, did include some language about

MS. WICHLENS: With respect, Your Honor, it makes

things simpler, but it doesn't achieve the purposes here

for the reasons that some of the Justices here today have

pointed out.

physical evidence is the equivalent of the statements.

and I'll - I'll go back and read Miranda to - to make

concern that compelled statements - we'll call them that -

are unreliable?

To what extent was the Miranda rule founded on the

Wasn't that a - a significant factor?

6

MS. WICHLENS: That was one of the factors.

7

QUESTION: Now, when you have tangible evidence,

8

then the reliability component substantially drops out of

9

the case.

10

MS. WICHLENS: That's correct, Your Honor.

11

QUESTION: And it seems to me that that makes

12

the, what you call dicta in Elstad, with reference to

13

physical evidence, point to a case that's even easier than

14

one - than the one that was in Elstad.

15

MS. WICHLENS: Well, Your Honor, I disagree with

16

the conclusion there, because the flip side of that is the

17

- the reliability of the physical evidence and the fact

18

that if the police find out where it is through a Miranda

19

violation, they just go and pick it up.

makes the deterrence factors different here.

Justice Kennedy was making -

Now, there - there may be other things that

work in Miranda, not just to make sure that the statement

MS. WICHLENS: Absolutely, Your Honor.

used to beat people up, say, they beat people up.

13

that's very repulsive.

Now,

14

MS. WICHLENS: That's correct.

come even close to that, we'll keep the statement out and

false testimony from - from being introduced, then it

3

seems to me quite reasonable to say that police can indeed

make the choice, do I want to use this testimony.

don't want to use this testimony, I won't give a Miranda

warning, and anything the testimony leads to, if it leads

7

think the primary - the primary function of Miranda is to

prevent browbeaten statements by - by - by confused people

14

MS. WICHLENS: The problem is, it lets the

individual officer on the street decide whether he or she

16

is going to give the Miranda warnings in a particular case

17

or not.

18

in, here I'm referring to an amicus filed in - in the

Perhaps I've been presumptuous to -

14

part of - a central part of the holding in Elstad, as I

understand it, was that in that case, the initial

constitutional violation is cured by the time the

18

have a Miranda violation, the Miranda warnings are not

read, the person is interrogated, then the Miranda

warnings are carefully and thoroughly read.

And if I could say another word about Elstad,

In other words, you

And as this Court stated in Elstad, and I'm

hear them.

4

QUESTION: But you have to read it to him anyway?

5

MS. WICHLENS: It's not hard to say, sorry, pal,

6

I have to read them to you, and even if you don't want to

7

require the officer to do that, how about, okay, pal,

8

would you like to waive those rights?

9

part of Miranda law also: A, inform the suspect of his

rights, B, ask him if he would like to waive them.
QUESTION: We take the case on the assumption,

12

the Government's question that there was a failure to give

13

a suspect the Miranda warnings here, do we not?

14

MS. WICHLENS: Correct.

Although the

15

Government's concession in the lower courts, district

16

court and Tenth Circuit, is that Miranda was violated

17

because there was a lack of a knowing waiver of those

18

Miranda rights, and that's the basis on which the district

19

court accepted the Government's concession.

20
21

But the -

QUESTION: What did the court of appeals - what
did the court of appeals -

22

MS. WICHLENS: The court of appeals assumed a

Miranda violation, and I believe repeated the language

about the waiver problem.

about the settled state of the law before this case arose

argument.

If you

MS. WICHLENS: Your Honor, simply that those

7

cases were mistaken.

This Court had never spoken directly

8

on the subject of derivative evidence rule in the context

9

of physical evidence.

And the times have changed, Your

10

Honor.

11

New York v. Harris, that followed Miranda most

12

immediately, we all assumed, naively it turns out, that

13

police officers would at least try to comply with Miranda.

14

And now there's this movement afoot to basically thumb

15

their noses, if you will, at this Court's Miranda decision

16

and say Miranda is just an option.

17
18
19

The time of Elstad and some of this Court's cases,

QUESTION: May I ask you if the state courts were
uniform in the same way the Federal courts were?
MS. WICHLENS: The state courts were not.

I've

20

cited some cases in my brief, both pre-Dickerson and post-

21

Dickerson, where the state courts were not at all uniform.

22
23

QUESTION: And was that on both the matter of
subsequent confessions and physical evidence?

24

MS. WICHLENS: Correct, Your Honor, as I recall.

25

If there are no further questions from the

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. DREEBEN: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

10

Miranda is a rule that is perfectly matched to the problem

11

that the Court sought to address, namely the risk that the

12

defendant's own self-incriminating statements would be

13

obtained by compulsion and admitted against him to prove

14

his guilt.

15

the Fifth Amendment, one going to reliability, the other

16

going to the state's burden to prove guilt with evidence

17

other than that extracted from the defendant's own mouth.

18

That risk implicated two central concerns of

Extension of Miranda to this case, which

19

involves physical evidence that does not involve the

reliability concerns that are at the heart of the Fifth

the defendant's own self-compelled words to incriminate

to the purpose of truth-seeking in a criminal trial that

is central to the Court's jurisprudence in this area.

Justice Stevens, I - as far as the Government is

4

aware, there was no more than a handful of cases in the

5

state courts that have followed the rule, other than what

6

the Federal rule had been.

7

opinion from the denial of certiorari in the Patterson

8

case, I believe, collects them, but this was by no means a

groundswell movement in the state courts.

Justice White's dissenting

QUESTION: Well, I understand, but I noticed that

11

in your brief, in your oral statement you said that they

12

were unanimous, your brief said there was a strong

13

majority in the Federal courts.

14

myself but is it - is it a unanimous view in the Federal

15

courts?

16

I haven't checked it out

MR. DREEBEN: My understanding is that there are

17

eight Federal circuits before Dickerson, including the

18

Tenth Circuit, that it held that suppression of derivative

QUESTION: Well, wait, can I - if you have a

4

What if the policeman deliberately fails to give

5

the Miranda warning in order to get the physical evidence?

MR. DREEBEN: In our view, Justice Breyer, no

7

different rule is warranted in that situation, because

8

Miranda continues to protect against the risk that it's

9

aimed at.

Absent actual compulsion, there is no warrant

10

for a rule that does anything other than suppress the

11

actual statements.
