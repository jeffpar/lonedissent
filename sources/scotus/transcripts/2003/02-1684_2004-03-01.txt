ORAL ARGUMENT OF DEBORAH J. CHUANG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MS. CHUANG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
For nearly 4 decades, the ultimate inquiry as to

12

whether a person is in custody is whether there is formal

13

arrest or restraint in freedom of movement to the degree

14

associated with formal arrest.

15

The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that the State

16

court had identified the correct legal standard for

17

determining custody, that no Supreme Court case had

18

addressed whether age and experience needed to be

19

considered for that determination, and that it was

20

borrowing legal principles from another area of

21

jurisprudence.

22

unreasonable for the State court to have abstained from

23

innovating such a new role.

24
25

Yet, it held that it was objectively

This case illustrates why Federal habeas relief
cannot be granted under 28 U.S.C., section 2254(d), when a

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

State court decision does not extend Supreme Court

2

precedent to a new context.

3

with the provisions of section 2254(d) for three reasons.

4

Such relief is incompatible

First, to require a State court to extrapolate

5

Supreme Court precedents from the voluntariness context to

6

the custody context cannot be fairly characterized as

7

applying this Court's custody precedents.

8
9

QUESTION:

Ms. Chuang, there are two questions

presented in the petition for certiorari.

One is what I

10

took it to be -- is the rule that the Ninth Circuit

11

announced correct under our precedents, and the second,

12

under AEDPA, was it objectively unreasonable for the State

13

court to rule otherwise.

14

those questions?

15

MS. CHUANG:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. CHUANG:

Are you going to address both

Yes, Your Honor.

Thank you.
The Ninth Circuit fundamentally

18

changed the rule for resolving custody claims by juveniles

19

and, second, Federal law as determined by the Supreme

20

Court refers -- is limited to the Supreme Court's

21

holdings.

22

that of this Court when it recognized that this Court had

23

never held so in the custody context.

24
25

The Ninth Circuit substituted its holding for

And third, to say that an extension of Supreme
Court precedent to a new context is clearly established

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

law would define clearly established at such a high --

2

QUESTION:

But how is it a new context?

I mean,

3

the -- the rule was how a reasonable man in the suspect's

4

position would have understood his situation.

5

new to say you -- I mean, it might be new if in fact there

6

was blind person and the agent who was holding him wrote

7

on a note, you are free to leave.

8

it.

9

to say that's ridiculous?

10
11
12

You know, he can't read

Now, would you need a new, special Supreme Court case

MS. CHUANG:
not.

So is it

No, Your Honor.

You -- you would

What -QUESTION:

Then why do you need a new, special

13

Supreme Court to say a very young person might feel very

14

differently about whether he's in custody from a person

15

who's a -- not -- not a child and not a minor?

16

MS. CHUANG:

Well, because this Court's

17

precedence as for custody determination has only

18

considered the circumstances encountered by the person --

19

QUESTION:

Well, we haven't considered blind

20

people either.

21

someone might whisper, you're free to go.

22

point is it's so obvious that -- that being a child or a

23

juvenile would make a difference, that you don't have to

24

write it in all the cases.

25

that obvious?

We haven't considered deaf people whom
I mean, the

So my question is, why isn't

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. CHUANG:

I believe that the answer is that

2

the ultimate inquiry for custody determinations is whether

3

there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom of

4

movement.

5

QUESTION:
case?

How old was the respondent in this

17-and-a-half, wasn't he?
MS. CHUANG:

Yes, Your Honor.

He was 17-and-a-

half years old during the interview.
QUESTION:

And I suppose, in the view of the

10

Ninth Circuit, he would have had to be treated quite

11

differently if he were 6 months older, if he were 18.

12

MS. CHUANG:

13

QUESTION:

I thought --

14

QUESTION:

What -- what if he were 6?

Yes, Your Honor.

Would --

15

would you acknowledge that -- that that factor should be

16

taken into account?

17

MS. CHUANG:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

18

that a 6-year-old -- that age and experience should be

19

considered because the test -- the ultimate inquiry is

20

whether there is a formal arrest or restraint in freedom

21

of movement.

22

QUESTION:

No, but that depends upon what a

23

reasonable person in the circumstances would understand to

24

be his situation whether a reasonable person would believe

25

he was being detained.

Isn't that the test?

So, I mean,

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

it doesn't -- it doesn't help to simply say that, you

2

know, the question is whether there's an arrest.

3

there is.

4

Yes,

That is the question.
But our standard for whether there has been an

5

arrest is what would a reasonable person believe.

6

he believe he was arrested?

7

into the determination of what a person would believe.

8
9

Would

Which gets you right back

Now, would we take into account the fact that
somebody is 6 years old?

10

MS. CHUANG:

We don't deny that a 6-year-old

11

would certainly be more vulnerable to overall coercion.

12

Yet, that is -- overall coercion is addressed by the

13

voluntariness test and really the custody question is only

14

concerned with one aspect of coercion and that is custody.

15

And to --

16

QUESTION:

Why -- why isn't it?

Look, I'm not

17

-- I guess let me try again because I can understand you'd

18

say there's only 6 months difference here.

19

case, being a juvenile didn't matter.

20

you're talking about.

21

So in this

But that's not what

You're talking about the standard that says the

22

nature of a person as a child or an adult is something

23

that can make a difference.

24

agreed being blind could make a difference to custody.

25

You agree being deaf could make a difference to custody.

All right?

To custody.

You

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Why can't being a child in principle make a difference to

2

custody?

3

whether the first part of your argument, not the second.

4

That's the question.

MS. CHUANG:

And it has only to do with

Well, Your Honor, I suppose that a

5

blind person, if you hand the blind person a note saying,

6

you are free to leave, would not -- you could not use that

7

note as an indication that he was free to leave.

8

couldn't use that as a circumstance to show that he was

9

free to leave.

10

QUESTION:

You

Well, isn't what you're objecting to

11

in the Ninth Circuit's decision the idea that there is

12

some sort of a bright line cutoff date when the person

13

turns 18?

14

would be treated differently than a 17-year-old, I

15

suppose, for determining the objective test.

You don't deny that a person 6 -- 6 years old

16

MS. CHUANG:

17

QUESTION:

18

Is that -- I thought you said age is

irrelevant.

19

MS. CHUANG:

20

QUESTION:

21

That's correct, Your Honor.

Yes.

That age is -- you -- you said age is

irrelevant to the custody determination.

22

MS. CHUANG:

23

QUESTION:

That's correct.

Age --

Other things like language is --

24

language is relevant if the person doesn't -- is not

25

conversant with English.

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. CHUANG:

Language might not be relevant,

2

Your Honor, because -- or -- or it might relevant because

3

if the person did not understand English and the officer

4

said, you are free to leave, that is -- that is a

5

circumstance that the person encountered that is within

6

the officer's control that the -- and the person doesn't

7

understand English, that would be something that could not

8

be relied upon later on to show that he was -- he

9

understood that he was free to leave.

But then again,

10

that might not mean that he could use it to show that he

11

was in custody as well.

12

QUESTION:

13

in -- in this particular case.

14

And correct me if I'm wrong.

15

Let -- let me ask you about two facts
The first one is this.

I think I'm right on these.

When the -- when the sheriff's department wanted

16

to question this -- this young man, they went to his

17

parents and the parents said, in effect, yes, we will --

18

we will bring him down or take him down with us, and they

19

took him to the station, so that as I understand it, the

20

sheriff's department didn't ask him to make a choice as to

21

whether they would go down to the headquarters and talk

22

with him.

23

The parents did that.
The second fact I want you to comment on is that

24

when they got down there, the parents said, in the boy's

25

hearing, can't we go in with him or can we go in with him?

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

They -- they made it clear that they would like to go into

2

this interrogation.

3

them out.

4

And the deputy sheriff said no, kept

The sheriff and the boy disappeared.
Are those two facts relevant in making the

5

determination of whether he would reasonably understand

6

that he was being under -- held under conditions

7

equivalent to a formal arrest?

8
9

MS. CHUANG:

No, Your Honor, I don't believe

they are relevant.

10

QUESTION:

11

MS. CHUANG:

Why -- why not?

Why not?

Because once -- again, if his -- if

12

his parents were asked for permission to interview, the

13

detective had asked the parents for permission to

14

interview him, and his parents said yes, the meaning of

15

that question was that he could have said no, and --

16
17

QUESTION:

Wait a minute.

You just lost me.

How -- how is it that he could have said no?

18

MS. CHUANG:

He could have refused to have

19

submitted to the interview, and there's no indication in

20

the record --

21

QUESTION:

Well, but he -- but he -- he didn't.

22

His parents said, yes, you can interview him.

23

bring him down, and the boy came along.

24

know.

25

MS. CHUANG:

We will

That's all we

That's correct, Your Honor.

That's

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

-- that's what we know.
QUESTION:

And why is that?

And that is

3

irrelevant you say because the boy might have said, well,

4

I won't go?

5

MS. CHUANG:

6

QUESTION:

That -- yes, Your Honor.

You don't know whether he would have

7

felt free to say that or not, do you?

8

in the record on that?

9

It's --

MS. CHUANG:

Do we have anything

There's no indication one way or

10

the other.

11

voluntarily being interviewed.

12

QUESTION:

But there was no indication that he was not

Well, there is an indication.

I -- I

13

mean, that's what I'm trying to get at.

14

indication is that he was taken down to the station house

15

by his parents.

16

got down there, the parents, who wanted to be present

17

during the interrogation, were told that they couldn't.

18

The -- the

He didn't make the choice.

And when they

The -- the -- it seems to me that the objective

19

appearance of -- of these two facts is, number one, the

20

boy appears to be under the control of his parents and his

21

parents appear to be under the control of the sheriff's

22

department when they get down to headquarters.

23

those two facts, I would think it would be difficult --

24

standing alone, those two facts, it would be difficult to

25

infer that this boy would have felt that he was free to

And on

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

turn around and -- and walk out of the interview and

2

leave.

3

not relevant.

4

And -- and I don't understand why those facts are

MS. CHUANG:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I -- there's

5

no indication, though, that he was at the station

6

involuntarily.

7
8
9

Certainly he came with his parents, but --

QUESTION:

Well, the indication is that his

parents brought him.

That's all we know.

MS. CHUANG:

Well, Your Honor, Mr. Alvarado --

10

it indicated in the record that Mr. Alvarado lived at home

11

with his parents and that he did not have a car.

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. CHUANG:

14

QUESTION:

He has to go where his parents tell

15

him to, doesn't he?

Isn't that what being in the status

16

of -- of a minor means, that if your parents tell you stay

17

at home, you're grounded, you're grounded?

18

essentially the disability of being a minor?

19

He's a minor, isn't he?
Yes, Your Honor.

Isn't that

So I guess maybe the proper inquiry is whether

20

his parents thought that they could let him leave if they

21

wanted to.

22

minor can be interrogated in -- in a police station

23

because it always requires the consent of the parents, and

24

when the parents tells him, you know, you go be

25

interrogated, he thinks he can't leave.

Either that's the proper inquiry or perhaps no

It's a terrible

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

problem, isn't it?
MS. CHUANG:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I believe

3

that custody by -- custody in the sense of a parental and

4

juvenile situation is not the same as custody as you are

5

under formal arrest or restrained in freedom of movement

6

to the same degree --

7

QUESTION:

Well, then that's the whole point.

8

That's why I think Justice Souter asked that question,

9

saying, look, you're -- you're used to your parents

10

telling you what to do and maybe even sometimes you do it.

11

All right?

12

(Laughter.)

13

QUESTION:

So the parents bring them down --

14

bring him down.

15

then asks Ms. Comstock, I guess, who was the arresting

16

officer that brought him in there, can I take my parents

17

in this room.

18

And the policewoman -- I think it was a woman, wasn't it?

19

I think she said no.

20

certainly want to get into the room, can't.

21

sitting there and that, together with all the other things

22

that are going on -- and there are quite a few -- would

23

lead a reasonable person, who's used to being under the --

24

the rule of his parents, to think, my goodness, this

25

police woman controls the situation.

He doesn't think he has any choice.

He

The parents say we want to go in the room.

And they, who desperately -- or
So he's

Of course, I have to

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

do what she says, and of course, I can't leave until, as

2

she said, I've finished answering the question and she can

3

-- tells me I can leave.

4

adult wouldn't be thinking that.

5

that's a reasonable question.

6

I'm in custody.

Now, maybe an

Maybe he would.

But our standard here is, you know, not whether

7

they were right in the State but whether they were

8

reasonable.

9

that.

10
11

But

But a juvenile certainly would be thinking

That's -- that's I think what the point is.
Now, I'd like to hear sort of a full-blown

response to that.

12

MS. CHUANG:

13

QUESTION:

Just as full-blown as the question.

14

QUESTION:

I mean, not just yes or no.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MS. CHUANG:

17

A juvenile -- unless the Court is willing to say

Yes, Your Honor.

Well, first a --

Yes, Your Honor.

18

that the parents in this case operated as agents of law

19

enforcement by bringing him into the sheriff's station and

20

that when the officer -- the detective had asked him if he

21

-- if the parents would give permission, that somehow that

22

really wasn't an option that the detective was giving, Mr.

23

Alvarado was not in custody.

24
25

QUESTION:

What I -- what I can't understand --

and this was Justice Souter's question.

Forget how these

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

factors play out one way or the other.

2

-- the circumstance that the parents brought the juvenile

3

to the station; two, that the parents wanted to go in or

4

asked someone -- asked to go in and they couldn't -- are

5

those objective factors that the Court can consider in the

6

custody determination?

7

MS. CHUANG:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

Are these factors

No, Your Honor, because --

So -- so if -- if the defense counsel

bring this up, the judge rules that it's to be excluded.
It's irrelevant.

11

MS. CHUANG:

12

QUESTION:

13

MS. CHUANG:

Yes, Your Honor.

All right.
Because as this Court alluded to in

14

Colorado v. Connolly what the Fifth Amendment is concerned

15

with is government coercion, and to the extent that the

16

parents brought Mr. Alvarado to the station, that is not

17

government coercion.

18

And as far as the parents not being allowed in

19

the interview room, there -- Mr. Alvarado actually did not

20

present any evidence that his parents were not permitted

21

into the interview room.

22

door was open, as indicated at joint appendix page 150.

23

QUESTION:

And indeed, the interview room

Well, would yo just correct me on the

24

facts?

25

parents had asked to go in, and as Justice Breyer pointed

I thought the -- the record indicated that the

15

out, that in fact the boy at one point said, you know, do

2

I have to go alone?

3

are -- is there testimony to that effect in the record?

4

Isn't anybody coming with me?

MS. CHUANG:

No, Your Honor.

Are --

There is no

5

testimony to that.

attorney, but his attorney relied upon the transcript of

7

the interview.

Indeed, it was only argued by his

This was at the suppression hearing.

11

MS. CHUANG:

QUESTION:

13

Yes, Your Honor.

Okay.
And --

Did -- did the State object to those

facts as being untrue and not in evidence?

14

MS. CHUANG:

Well, the State didn't -- no, Your

15

Honor.

16

relying on the fact that it was the interview transcript

17

that Mr. Alvarado's counsel was using, and indeed, at the

18

trial when Mr. Alvarado testified, he never stated that he

asked for his parents to be in there, and he had testified

20

that he didn't feel coerced or --

The State did not, but the -- the State was

QUESTION:

May I --

QUESTION:

Where -- where did this fact come

23

from?

It's in the interview transcript?

MS. CHUANG:

QUESTION:

I'm sorry?

Where did this fact or factoid come

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

from that -- you know, that -- that his parents wanted to

2

go in but they were told they couldn't?

3

from?

5

MS. CHUANG:

Where did it come

His -- it came from his attorney's

argument during the suppression hearing.

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. CHUANG:

It's not in any evidence.
No, Your Honor.

It's not in any

8

evidence.

9

to extrapolate from this Court's voluntariness precedents

10

that predated Miranda to decide what types of individual

11

characteristics needed to be considered for a Miranda

12

custody, is not what section 2254(d) requires.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN P. ELWOOD

6

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

7

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

8
9
10

MR. ELWOOD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit erred when it held that a

11

juvenile's age and experience must be considered in

12

determining whether or not he is in custody for purposes

13

of the Miranda test.

14

QUESTION:

Do you agree that the fact that the

15

parents brought the person to the station and that they

16

were -- requested to be in the room it -- are -- are not

17

relevant to the custody determination?

18

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that they can be considered

19

by the court in determining the -- the circumstances

20

surrounding the interrogation, just as in Oregon v.

21

Mathiason they considered the fact the -- the person came

22

to the station on his own power.

23

QUESTION:

So that they are relevant to the

24

objective inquiry whether or not a reasonable person

25

thought he was under custody in these circumstances.

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that they are facts that

2

can be considered by a -- under the reasonable person

3

standard to determine whether a reasonable person would

4

have felt that he was not free to leave or rather that he

5

was under formal arrest at that point.

6
7

QUESTION:
that point.

8
9

So you disagree with the State on

MR. ELWOOD:

I -- I think it's a -- it's a

slightly different viewpoint because I -- I don't think

10

that's what the Ninth Circuit was getting at.

11

Ninth Circuit was basically saying is that you don't

12

employ the reasonable person standard.

13

employ a reasonable juvenile standard, and you view all

14

the circumstances differently.

15

What the

You, rather,

I think, though, that you can consider the fact

16

that he -- particularly the alleged fact that he -- his

17

parents were excluded from the interview in determining

18

what a reasonable person would have felt from that.

19

Unfortunately, because it was simply argued by his

20

attorney at the suppression hearing and there were no

21

findings on it, we don't know exactly how that happened.

18

we may have -- I -- I don't recall -- the defendant's own

19

testimony at the -- the trial itself.

20

But in any event, our point with respect to the

21

exclusion is you have to look at what -- how a reasonable

22

person would view that, not necessarily a reasonable

23

juvenile, but a reasonable person.

QUESTION:

draw any inference about whether he could leave at --

2

anytime he wanted to?

3

MR. ELWOOD:

Again, I think it depends on how it

4

was put because if they just say, no, you may not come in,

5

I think a reasonable person could conclude from that that

6

they're exercising control over the interrogation and that

7

they -- that might extend to whether or not he's free to

8

go.

9

along the lines of, no, we'd rather you not because he'll

QUESTION:

Do you think it would make a

14

difference in that inquiry if the person being

15

interrogated was 35 years old, on the one hand, and 10

16

years old on the other hand?

17

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that it doesn't make a

18

legal difference for Miranda purposes, and that's our

19

basic argument, is that Miranda doesn't -- didn't develop

20

a rule that provides protection tailored for the specific

21

circumstances of -- of the person who's under

interrogation.

And you're telling me that the 35-

year-old example and the 10-year-old example should be

MR. ELWOOD:

I think that they should be treated

the same for purposes of the Miranda prophylactic rule.

6

They should not be treated differently for voluntariness.

8

QUESTION:

For the purposes of determining

whether he thinks he's in custody.

9

MR. ELWOOD:

Yes, that is correct.

And I think

10

that traditionally what the Court has done is it has

11

viewed the circumstances that you look to, the totality of

12

the circumstances, as being external to the reasonable

person.

MR. ELWOOD:

The point is that one -- one of the

16

important factors to determine when you're figuring out

what the totality of the circumstances is that you apply

MR. ELWOOD:

Is that the -- is the -- is that

11

the person -- you can consider what the police officer

communicated to them, and when you're figuring out what

13

the police officer communicated to them, the police

14

officer doesn't get to, you know, pretend that a blind

15

person can see.

16

when you hand them a written notice, they're not going to

17

see it, just as though -- just as if you whispered it to

18

them in a voice too low for them to hear.

19

is that you didn't communicate anything to them.

20

They have to take into consideration that

The basic point

And our objection to the Ninth Circuit's

21

standard is they're trying to make you view the entire

22

world through the viewpoint of a reasonable juvenile,

23

which means that we're not talking about whether or not

24

the person was unable to leave the room when they wanted

25

to because they couldn't reach the doorknob because they

25
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

were short.

2

something about the way they view the entire world because

3

they're a juvenile.

4

more likely to be submissive to authority.

5

they're a juvenile, they're more likely to feel that --

6

that anything that the police officer says is a command.

7

The point is that we're trying to infer

Because they're a juvenile, they're
Because

And I think that it's very different to adopt a

8

whole different world view thing versus simply asking

9

police officers to take notice of things that are

10

objectively very plain or rather observable and very

11

plain, such as a blind person cannot see the warning that

12

you give him.

13

difference between what is permissible under the

14

reasonable person test, as it has always been applied, and

15

the Ninth Circuit's innovation of it.

And I think that that is the basic

16

Now --

17

QUESTION:

On -- on your view of this case, is

18

it -- suppose we say, all right, reasonable person doesn't

19

mean 16.

20

the totality of the circumstances and see if they add up

21

to in custody using the reasonable person standard?

22

Could -- would a remand be appropriate to view

MR. ELWOOD:

Justice Ginsburg, I think that a

23

remand isn't necessary because I think that what the State

24

court of appeals did is approximately right, or at least

25

it's within the range of reason.

So, no, I don't think

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

that you would need to do that.
Now, if I could get back to one -- one of the

3

questions that Justice Scalia asked, which was do we apply

4

the same standard for a 6-year-old.

5

seem kind of intuitively wrong, yes, we would apply the

6

same reasonable person standard that we would to anybody

7

else, with the point being that it's a very difficult

8

thing to require police officers not only to know that a

9

6-year-old is more vulnerable, but also to know exactly

10

where along the continuum of custody versus non-custody

11

that -- that puts them because they have to take

12

themselves out of their reasonable person mind-set that

13

they're used to applying and figure out how it applies

14

differently here.

15

And although it may

And I think that it doesn't make a lot of sense

16

to develop this whole different kind of sideline to the

17

normal Miranda reasonable person test for 6-year-olds

18

because the very factors that would make them more likely

19

to view themselves to be in custody would also make them

20

less likely to be able to use these Miranda rules if they

21

were actually -- Miranda rights if they were given them.

22

If -- if a -- if a 6-year-old is going to feel too

23

submissive to authority, it doesn't make a lot of sense to

24

apply a lower custody threshold if then he's not going to

25

be able to take advantage of it.

I really don't understand.

If you

inexorably he, therefore, would reasonably feel he could

5

not leave when -- where an older person would?

you say that you -- the 6-year-old would feel more

follow that he would be less likely to think he was free

Right.

And our point is that --

And if it -- if it makes a difference

of his age, why doesn't that make it relevant?

Because what we're talking about

In that case, it recognized that juvenile status

procedural safeguards.

16
17

In Miranda in 1966, this Court found that those
procedural safeguards would be the Miranda warnings.

18

And then in In re Gault in 1965, the Court found

19

that the greatest care must be taken to assure a minor's

20

confession was voluntary not only in the sense that it was

21

coerced, but also that it's not a product of ignorance of

22

rights.

23

It follows --

that the police are supposed to do.

I mean, isn't it -- isn't it really a -- a warning

And so that the situation is as -- as

MS. ALLEN:

It's just an objective thing that --

If you were to recite a Miranda

8

warning to a 6-year-old, in the waiver determination they

9

would decide whether that 6-year-old understood the waiver

10

of his rights, and the evidence would come in there as

13

QUESTION:

Oh, so -- so that even the giving of

a Miranda warning would not suffice.

MS. ALLEN:

The giving of a Miranda warning

doesn't suffice.

you can contest coercion.

It severely cuts down the cases in which

indication here that the State did not take account of the

fact that he was a juvenile, but having taken account of

it in the State proceedings, they just reached the

conclusion that it didn't in this case matter that much?

14

Now, why do we think that that isn't what happened?

15

MS. ALLEN:

When you read the California State

opinion in this case, they don't mention Michael's age.

17

They don't mention anything about the fact that he was a

18

juvenile or how a reasonable juvenile would have assessed

19

the situation.

QUESTION:

I can understand why they might not

MS. ALLEN:

It's more than the age in this case.

to me you have a rather bad case on the facts to press the

difference in age of somebody who's almost 18.

15

MS. ALLEN:

I think even if Michael had been 18

If juvenility must be taken into

account for the custody determination, how -- how is it

13

that it is not taken into account for the purpose of what

14

the nature of the warning has to be, assuming custody?

15

mean, we have one Miranda warning that presumably I have

always thought is given to everybody from the 6-year-old

to the senior citizen.

MS. ALLEN:

19

QUESTION:

I

And -Now, if -- if, indeed as you say,

relevant to this whole thing is -- is the age of the

year-old Miranda warning, a 17-and-a-half-year-old Miranda

23

warning, and so forth.

24
25

MS. ALLEN:
Justice Scalia.

I have two things to say about that,

One is many States do employ a different

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Miranda warning for juveniles in their statutes.

2

Secondly, this Court in Miranda, when putting down the

3

warning, I assume it applies to both juveniles and adults,

4

and ignoring the -- the juvenile status is basically

5

making it an adult standard.

6

standard to juveniles instead of providing for the

7

greatest care, you would actually be giving them less

8

protection to which they're entitled under the clearly

9

established Federal law.

10

QUESTION:

If you're applying an adult

many cases, voluntariness may remain an issue, for

1

trying to protect people's rights from the beginning, it

2

should be taken into account at the beginning instead of

3

waiting until the end when it's too late essentially.

4

It's very hard to meet a voluntariness test when this

5

could be taken care of on the front end by police giving

6

people their 15-second Miranda warnings, particularly

7

juveniles who they know are going to assess their freedom

8

to leave differently than adults.

9
