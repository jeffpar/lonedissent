ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. FELDMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
This case concerns 47 U.S.C., section 253(a)

12

which preempts State laws that prohibit or have the effect

13

of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide

14

telecommunications services.

15

Now, it's common ground that section 253(a)

16

preempts State laws that keep private firms from the

17

telecommunications market.

18

whether the law also reaches into the structure of State

19

government and invalidating even a State statute that

20

declines to grant the State's political subdivisions the

21

authority to provide telecommunications.

22

The question presented is

In Gregory against Ashcroft, this Court held

23

that Federal statutes should not be construed to intrude

24

on core areas of State sovereignty unless Congress has

25

made its intent to do so clear.

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Now, in our tradition, political subdivisions

2

are creatures of the State and they have the authority and

3

only the authority that the State has granted them.

4

respondents' interpretation, section 253(a) would be a

5

sharp and unprecedented break with that tradition because

6

it would be a grant of power by the Federal Government to

7

political subdivisions of powers that the State, which was

8

hitherto the sole source of their authority --

9

QUESTION:

10

wouldn't be a grant of power.

11

preserve power granted by the State itself.

12

I don't think that's right.

MR. FELDMAN:

Under

It

It would be -- it would

Well, I don't -- I'm not even sure

13

whether that's true.

14

difficulty in construing the statute the way the court of

15

appeals did.

16

subdivisions or some political subdivisions and say you

17

have only the authority that we have given you, and it's

18

not -- other States create political subdivisions and say

19

you have any authority you want except --

20

That actually goes into another

Some States create their political

The only -- the only thing I question

21

is your statement that the statute itself is a grant of

power to a local entity.

23

anybody.

It doesn't grant any power to

The statute doesn't.

24

MR. FELDMAN:

25

QUESTION:

Well, I think --

It preserves power from being

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

preempted.

2
3

MR. FELDMAN:

Well, perhaps it's a question of

semantics, but --

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FELDMAN:

It is.
-- but -- but the -- but the --

6

the issue here is that in Missouri political subdivisions

7

do not have the authority to provide telecommunications

8

services.

9

that -- that reaches that result is preempted, and

Under the court of appeals' ruling, the statute

10

therefore they do have that authority.

11

would be a sharp break with the tradition that because it

12

would be Congress specifying what the authority of a

13

political subdivision is even when a State has chosen not

14

to give it that authority.

15

QUESTION:

In any event, that

Is it your view that in all instances

16

we must interpret this statute so that any entity -- that

17

phrase -- does not include a local subdivision of the

18

State?

19

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, because under the Gregory

20

rule, if you -- if the Court were to construe the statute

21

so that it did include political subdivisions, it would be

22

a intrusion into State sovereignty.

23

QUESTION:

It would be under the circumstances

24

of this case.

25

would not intrude on the right of the State to allocate

Are there other circumstances in which it

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

powers between itself and the localities so that this

2

statute -- so that this interpretation would have an

3

effect in some other instance?

4

MR. FELDMAN:

The other -- I can't imagine cases

5

-- and I'm not aware that any have come up in the cases

6

that have addressed the -- the question presented here --

7

where there are some other restriction that a State has

8

passed that has nothing to do with political subdivisions.

9

And the question might arise whether a political

10

subdivision could challenge that -- that provision of

11

State law as well as a private party.

12

And -- but, however, since the Court is in the

13

business here of construing the statute and the question

14

is what is the meaning of the word any entity, I think

15

under the Gregory rule, that -- that term has to exclude

16

political subdivisions.

17

think it -- there's no --

18

QUESTION:

And if it excludes it here, I

Mr. Feldman, do we need to apply the

19

clear statement rule of Gregory v. Ashcroft for you to

20

prevail?

21

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it's our understanding --

22

it's our understanding that the rule would apply here.

23

guess the rule applies for the reasons I've already given,

24

which is this is an intrusion on State sovereignty.

25

that were not the case, the question would be whether a

I

If

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

general term like the term, any entity, is whether that

2

would just naturally be construed to extend so far or

3

whether it wouldn't.

4

QUESTION:

5

MR. FELDMAN:

Exactly.
And I would say that it raises the

6

question that I was -- the -- the problem that I was

7

referring to before in responding to Justice Stevens,

8

which is State -- the application of 253(a) would depend

9

on the form in which a State chooses to give or not give

10

its power to its political subdivisions.

11

State -- a home rule State where the cities have all the

12

powers except what's expressly denied them, then a State

13

that tried to pull back the power to provide

14

telecommunications -- that would be preempted.

15

State --

16
17

QUESTION:

If it was a

In another

Are those home rule States

established in that fashion by the State constitutions?

18

MR. FELDMAN:

19

QUESTION:

I think so sometimes.

In which case the language of section

20

253(a) which says no State or local statute or regulation

21

or other State or local legal requirement may prohibit or

22

have the effect of prohibiting.

23

would reach a constitutional question.

24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

I'm not sure that -- that

It would at least be a difficult

question to try to figure out whether there is still

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

something that prohibits or has the effect of prohibiting

2

rather than something which just never granted the

3

authority before.

4

subdivision of a State that's a special purpose water

5

district or fire prevention district that just doesn't

6

have the authority, was never intended to have the

7

authority, and nothing in State law suggests that it

8

should have the authority to provide telecommunications.

9

It would be hard to find something that should be

10

You could consider a political

preempted in that case.

11

QUESTION:

Suppose you didn't give that very

12

broad meaning to any entity, but you included State

13

entities that had been in the business and were otherwise

14

authorized by State law to go into this business and then

15

the State changes its law and without having a section (b)

16

requirement, because you have loads of power under section

17

(b), so we assume the entity meets section (b)'s test, but

18

it passes another law which says, by the way, the

19

municipality can't go into it.

20

So -- so we're not -- we're -- we're talking about only

21

entities that have proved themselves fit, willing, and

22

able to offer the -- the -- to offer the business.

23

MR. FELDMAN:

24

QUESTION:

25

And previously they had.

I -- I don't --

Now, why -- why would that not be

included?

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FELDMAN:

I -- I don't think it -- because I

2

-- I think that there is -- it's very difficult to imagine

3

that Congress intended that the -- the scope of this

4

statute should turn on the exact historical steps --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. FELDMAN:

7

QUESTION:

No, no.
-- that they once had or --

But what we want -- we want -- we

8

have implicitly there and it would be necessary in the

9

State case but not in the private entity case an entity

10

that is fit, willing, and able.

11

is fit, willing, and able can include a municipality.

12

what this statute is after is the State passing a new law

13

changing the status of an entity that was previously fit,

14

willing, and able.

15

MR. FELDMAN:

And -- and an entity that
So

But I guess what I was responding

16

to was it's not -- the -- the definition of what a

17

political subdivision is fit, willing, and able to do is

18

something that -- it is a creature of State law.

19

defined by State law, by the State laws that have --

20

QUESTION:

It's

That -- that's correct, but it's

21

defined by State regulatory law in respect to those

22

entities at least that have previously offered the

23

business.

24
25

MR. FELDMAN:

I think there's actually very few

-- before 1996, I think there were very few -- and I'm not

aware of examples.

There may be a few in the amicus

briefs.

of these political subdivisions that offered

telecommunications services.

only arisen --

There are very, very few entities in this country

6

QUESTION:

This is a question that has

You see, in other words, but your

7

argument here is coming down to the difficulty of trying

8

to draw the distinction I'm suggesting.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

I think that -- I think part of my

10

argument is the difficulty of drawing that distinction,

11

but the most important part of it is that this is an

12

intrusion into a State's understanding of its government

13

and what it wants to do with its authority.

14

State --

15

QUESTION:

And where a

If the -- if the statute were clear,

16

if it said public -- it said any entity, public or private

17

-- but you're -- you're making an argument now that seems

18

to say no matter how clear this was, there would still be

19

a vulnerability.

20

MR. FELDMAN:

No.

I don't -- I don't think so.

21

I think there would be interpretive problems that would

22

arise in the statute if it had said -- specified any

23

public -- any governmental entity or something like that

24

that really would have clearly referred to States and

25

political subdivisions.

MR. FELDMAN:

I think it's likely that that

would do.

7

kind of general term without the -- the reference to

8

public or private or without specific references to State

9

governments and political subdivisions.

The problem here is that any entity is just the

It's just the

10

kind of general term that this Court referred to in Raygor

11

and said that where there's a clear statement rule, that

12

kind of general term is not sufficient to overcome it.

13

And here, there's nothing in the statute that suggests

14

that Congress thought about, considered, and intended to

15

put into question the issue of State sovereignty that

16

would be -- that -- the intrusion on State sovereignty

17

that would be raised by construing 253(a) the way the

18

court of appeals did.

19

Beyond the statute itself, in the legislative

20

history there's -- there is a -- the committee report

21

repeatedly refers to the private sector deployment of

22

advanced telecommunications as what the bill is designed

23

to achieve.

cited in, I think, Southwestern Bell's reply brief -- show

also people consistently referring to the private sector

QUESTION:

May I ask you this one more sort of

general question?

the statute as an anti-monopoly statute.

grant any exclusive privilege.

8

that's really what it does.

9

were the purpose, why wouldn't they write it that way that

As I understand your theory, you read
No State shall

Isn't that -- you say

And my question is if that

10

no State shall grant a monopoly or grant exclusive

11

privilege?

12

MR. FELDMAN:

It actually is broader than that.

13

There is another provision which says -- I don't remember

14

the number -- which says that there can't be exclusive

15

franchises.

16

would by terms give an exclusive franchise or keep a

17

particular company out of the telecommunications business,

18

but also that would have the effect of doing that by

19

imposing high taxes on one category of -- of participants

20

rather than on another category.

21

in fact, in the Texas case that came before this, the

22

Federal Communications Commission found a couple of

23

provisions of Texas law preempted because they did just

24

that.

25

This is intended to get at laws not only that

There -- there's the --

And the statute was designed -- it is an anti-

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

monopoly law, but it is a little bit broader than just

2

granting exclusive franchises.

3

at one -- one company or one class of company or the

4

incumbent telephone company over other new entrants into

5

the field.

6

It's also favoring one --

Respondents cite the -- Lead-Deadwood case as

7

the closest that they can come to this, and I'd just like

8

to point out that that case has a dramatically different

9

question than the one here.

In that case, there was no

10

question of the Federal Government giving authority to

11

local -- to political subdivisions that the State itself

12

had not -- had not given.

13

to this case if, for example, the State there had said we

14

don't want our political subdivisions to be providing

15

education because we do that at the State level, and then

16

the political subdivision had taken the Federal money that

17

was at issue there and said we want to open up a local

18

university or something.

19

presented the question that's presented here of an

20

intrusion of that sort on State sovereignty, but that

21

wasn't before the Court there and therefore the Court

22

didn't apply a clear statement rule.

Commission's position is if, under State law, it's treated

11

as a private entity, the fact that stock, some or even all

13

wouldn't be -- it would still be an entity.

14

-- if it's treated under State law as a private company.

In this case, the FCC looked at Missouri law and

16

determined, I think, correctly -- it hasn't been

17

challenged here -- that this is simply a law that prevents

18

political subdivisions as political subdivisions from

19

providing telecommunications services, and therefore,

20

since it's really operating on the political subdivision

21

itself and not on some other corporation, it's not

preempted.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RONALD MOLTENI

2

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER NIXON

3
4

MR. MOLTENI:

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

the Court:

5

The Eighth Circuit interprets entity to include

6

political subdivisions of the States, and that would mean

7

that Congress has -- it would have the effect of Congress

8

giving Missouri's political subdivisions authority that

9

the -- the very State that created them has withheld.

And

10

that would intrude drastically on the structure of State

11

government.

12

A general language term like entity is too broad

13

to meet the Gregory test because it doesn't clearly and

14

unmistakably include State subdivisions.

15

general term entity, without a contextual compass, as it

16

appears in 253(a), satisfies the clear and unmistakable

17

test, then clear and unmistakable really has little

18

meaning.

19

If -- if the

But that standard is important to the States

20

because it gives the States some notice and opportunity to

21

react to proposed legislation that may intrude on State

22

sovereignty, and it requires Congress to be clear in the

23

wording that it uses and to demonstrate cognizance of the

24

impact of legislation on State sovereignty.

25

QUESTION:

Why isn't any entity clear?

that need to be there.

within the statute that -- that demonstrates that Congress

12

was cognizant it intended to intrude on State government.

13

There are other instances -- and I think Southwestern

Bell's brief does a nice job pointing out that entity is

15

used 600-and-some times in various statutes.

16

multiple times even in the Telecommunications Act,

17

oftentimes with a modifier, sometimes without, and

principles that -- that we've cited in our brief regarding

14

Hunter and -- and the City of Trenton case that the States

15

control the -- the creations that they have, that they've

16

made, all their political subdivisions, and -- and that is

17

-- is something that this Court has always honored.

18

QUESTION:

You're saying that it's one thing for

19

the Federal Government to supersede State regulation

20

substantively, but another thing to say -- to tell the

21

State not only do we do that, but we're going to change

22

the relationship you have with your local subdivisions.

25

MR. MOLTENI:
Justice.

That's exactly right, Mr. Chief

That's exactly right.
QUESTION:

Suppose they -- they did -- is it

2

totally Ashcroft you're relying on?

Gregory v. Ashcroft?

The -- suppose you looked at the statute as

3

saying it doesn't prohibit States from enacting all kinds

4

of laws that have the effect of prohibiting people to

5

enter the business.

6

them without money to do it.

7

specific laws aimed at saying you can't enter.

8

it's aimed at specific laws saying you can't enter this

9

business, then couldn't you say where a State's entity

10

otherwise would have the authority to enter, then the

11

State cannot pass a law that says in those circumstances

12

you cannot enter telecommunications such as municipality

13

as well as private company?

14

Tax laws, for example, might leave
It's only talking about
And if

Now, what's wrong with that interpretation?

15

What I'm doing is I'm trying to deal with what I thought

16

of myself and they confirm is the major objection that

17

this can't be administered once we start down the path I'm

18

just starting down.

19

MR. MOLTENI:

Justice Breyer, I think it would

20

create an anomalous situation where if a State's political

21

subdivisions had been providing telecommunications prior

22

to 1996, they would be treated differently under the --

23

under 253(a).

24
25

QUESTION:

No, no.

It would be -- the question

would be whether they had the authority to do it.

If they

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

had the authority to do it, then the State -- what it

2

could not do is it could not pass a law which aims at

3

primarily -- aims at primarily their authority to enter

4

telecommunications.

5

things including removing authority as long as it were

6

general, and then there would be middle cases where the

7

authority, you see, is --

8

They could do all kinds of other

MR. MOLTENI:

But I -- I still think, Justice

9

Breyer, that what that does is it make -- it divides the

10

States into two categories and makes the Federal statute

11

treat the States in two different ways so that if a State

12

had granted authority prior to 1996, the -- they -- they

13

may never -- that State is never allowed to change its

14

mind about --

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. MOLTENI:

17
18

It's a one-way ratchet.
-- about the scope of authority

that it grants its own political subdivisions.
QUESTION:

I -- I suppose it would also allow

19

States to adopt a -- a system of chartering corporations

20

which charters the corporations according to various

21

categories, mining, manufacturing, and it just does not

22

happen to name the category of telecommunications.

23

that would not be touched by -- by this type of an

24

interpretation enabling the State to create a monopoly --

25

well, to -- to exclude any -- any telecommunication

And

company.
MR. MOLTENI:

Justice Scalia, I believe that I

3

agree with you, although I think the more and more we talk

4

about what States authorize and don't authorize their

5

political subdivisions do -- to do, the more and more that

6

becomes really the -- a State issue and -- and really what

7

I -- what I would call an intramural issue that would --

8

that would be a matter litigated between the States and

9

their political subdivisions at the State court level.

10

And what -- what I really think this case is about is an

11

application of 253(a) that, because of the general

12

language that -- that Congress used, won't be presumed and

13

cannot meet the clear and unmistakable standard in Gregory

14

to -- to allow or at least have the effect of -- of

15

Congress' intruding into the structure of State

16

government.

17

QUESTION:

So suppose that a State says that no

18

political subdivision in this State shall have the

19

telecommunications facility that does interactive

20

television unless the carrier that it contracts with pays

21

the city a fee of $1 million.

22

MR. MOLTENI:

23

QUESTION:

Could the State do that?

I believe --

And you'd say -- in other words, it's

24

conditioning the ability of its subdivisions to engage in

25

this by demanding that it extract certain financial

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

consideration, and suppose that this is prohibitive.

2

MR. MOLTENI:

If -- if the State were addressing

3

that in terms -- through the private sector, I don't think

4

there would be -- I'm not sure I understand exactly where

5

your question is going, Justice Kennedy.

6

-- the State can't create barriers to entry to private

7

sector competitors.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MOLTENI:

But the -- could

Well, suppose -- suppose -That's clearly preempted by the

10

Commerce Clause and -- and it's prevented specifically by

11

253(a).

12

And I think what -- what that derives from, if

13

one looks at the purpose of the Federal Telecommunications

14

Act of 1996 and you look at the -- the history of what was

15

going on, huge swatches of the country were provided

16

service by regional Bell operating companies and they were

17

granted the exclusive franchise in -- in areas.

18

whole purpose of the '96 act was to accelerate private

19

sector deployment and -- and to -- to take these -- these

20

swatches of territory that regional Bell operating

21

companies maintained monopolies on and encourage private

22

sector deployment and people would come in and utilize

23

either those -- the -- the facilities that -- that were

24

provided -- that -- that exist that the regional Bell

25

operating companies had or unbundle network elements or to

And the

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

-- to resell and -- and hopefully even the encouragement

2

of -- of building their own facilities base.

3

But that's all -- that all ends up being a red

4

herring discussion in terms of the clear language of

5

253(a) because 253(a) uses those general terms.

6

Now, the FCC's reading of entity won't bar

7

States from entering commercial phone business through

8

their -- through their political subdivisions because the

9

FCC's reading allows that States who want to go into the

10

phone business -- they'll be able to do that.

11

like Missouri that want their political subdivisions

12

focused on core missions will be able to make that choice

13

if this Court allows the FCC's reading.

14
15

QUESTION:

Do we know how many States allow

their municipalities to enter this business?

16

MR. MOLTENI:

17

QUESTION:

How many States allow their own --

Yes.

In other words, you're arguing

18

for a position it's up to the State.

19

municipalities enter or not if they choose.

20

fact, what has happened across the country?

21

But States

MR. MOLTENI:

They can let the
So in -- in

Justice Ginsburg, I -- I do not

22

know that.

23

political subdivisions to -- to enter the commercial phone

24

business and -- and which, like Missouri, have made that

25

choice to have -- made the choice to have their -- their

I have not surveyed which States allow their

23
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

political subdivisions focus on their core missions.
Another problem that's created with the

3

respondents' reading of -- of entity is that it literally

4

means the State cannot regulate itself, and that -- that

5

creates an anomaly and -- and it doesn't make a lot of

6

linguistic sense or a lot of public policy sense.

7

The clear and unmistakable standard requires

8

more of Congress than this use of general language and

9

where there is doubt, States are entitled to the benefit

10
11

of that doubt.
If the Court has no further questions, Missouri

12

would respectfully request that the Court reverse the

13

Eighth Circuit and preserve the ability of the State of

14

Missouri to determine the functions of its own political

15

subdivisions.

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Our position in this case is straightforward and

23

I can state it very simply.

24

applies in circumstances where the statutory language is

25

ambiguous.

Gregory against Ashcroft

The Court has said that three times, including

MR. STRAUSS:

I -- I wouldn't -- I wouldn't -- I

10

guess it doesn't mean any fish, Justice Breyer, but of the

11

-- I think it has a very broad meaning.

12

any entity and --

13

QUESTION:

I think it means

When you -- when you say the statute

14

has to be ambiguous, the Gregory rule as put forth in the

15

opinion is that there has to be a clear statement covering

16

the Federal -- Federal aspect of the thing.

17

to me that that cuts away from the idea it has to be

18

ambiguous.

19

MR. STRAUSS:

And it seems

What the Court -- the Court said

20

in Gregory that the statute has to be ambiguous and it

21

reiterated that in Salinas and more recently in Yeskey.

22

QUESTION:

It depends on what you mean by -- by

23

ambiguous.

24

was -- was employees, wasn't it?

25

MR. STRAUSS:

What -- what -- the -- the language in Gregory

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Gregory was employee.

The ambiguous language was at the

2

policymaking level.

3

an important point, Justice Scalia.

4

the Court thought it was unambiguous that employee, State

5

employee, included State judges.

6

linguistically to say that State employee includes State

7

judges is more of a stretch than saying any entity

8

includes local governments, but that's what --

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes.

Atascadero, Justice Scalia,

19

I think the Court has applied a different, stronger, much

20

stronger, form of a clear statement rule in the State

21

sovereign immunity cases where it has required specificity

22

in the Court's words.

23

QUESTION:

I think there are various levels of

MR. STRAUSS:

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

illustration of that is the contrast between the Court's

2

decision in Raygor and the Court's decision in Jinks which

3

have the advantage of focusing on exactly the same

4

statutory language, any claim asserted in a supplemental

5

jurisdiction statute.

6

that language overrode State sovereign immunity, and the

7

Court said no.

8

language overrode a State's decision to immunize its

9

subdivisions, and the Court said, yes, it did.

10
11

In Raygor, the issue was whether

In Jinks, the question was whether that

The same

language.
Jinks is the case like this.

In fact, Jinks is

12

more of an intrusion because the Congress was taking away

13

a power that the State wanted to confer and the locality

14

wanted to have, and the Court just very unanimously and

15

with no difficulty said Congress can do that with the

16

language, any claim asserted.

Raygor was a State

17

sovereign immunity question.

The Court analyzed it

18

differently.

19

And I think that makes the point that the kind

20

of rigor the Court expected in cases like Atascadero does

21

not apply in Gregory cases.

22

unambiguous, that's the end of the case.

23
24
25

QUESTION:

In Gregory cases, if it's

Does the word, any entity, cover the

State itself?
MR. STRAUSS:

Yes, I think it covers the State

itself.
QUESTION:

So if the Governor is about to sign a

3

contract to -- to allow the State to enter into

4

communications facilities and the legislature instructs

5

him not to, that statute is void?

6

MR. STRAUSS:

No, that statute is not void,

7

Justice Kennedy.

8

that situation is exactly the same as if a board of

9

directors of a private corporation decided not to go into

I think that statute -- analytically

10

the telecommunications business and the CEO defied it.

11

And the solution is the State can say under our neutral

12

principles of corporate governance, the CEO can't do that

13

not because the corporation is not an entity.

14

QUESTION:

Why don't neutral principles of

15

corporate governance apply to the relations between the

16

State and its subdivisions?

17

MR. STRAUSS:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

They --

Suppose there's a constitutional

provision.
MR. STRAUSS:

They absolutely do if they are

21

truly neutral principles.

22

law that says, for example, subdivisions may not engage in

23

any commercial activity and there's no argument that

24

that's just a subterfuge to keep them out of

25

telecommunications, it's a truly neutral provision, States

If it's a provision of State

28
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

can absolutely enforce that.

QUESTION:

3

precise to telecommunications.

But you say that it can't be made

4

MR. STRAUSS:

5

QUESTION:

6

That's right.

That was my example in the State

hypothetical, in the first hypothetical.

7

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, the -- what's -- what's

8

operating there is the general rule that Governors have to

9

do what the State legislature tells them to do.

10

QUESTION:

Well, here it was operating as a

11

general rule that subdivisions have to do what the State

12

tells them to.

13

MR. STRAUSS:

14

QUESTION:

Well, when this --

I don't see why the general rule

15

applies in one instance and not the other, given your

16

definition of entity.

17

MR. STRAUSS:

Because in the -- in the case like

18

this one, what the State has done is to enact a specific,

19

targeted rule not competitively neutral -- that issue is,

20

strictly speaking, not before the Court yet -- a targeted

21

rule that keeps an entity out of the telecommunications

22

business.

23

that a private firm is an entity.

24

any entity.

25

And a municipality is an entity in the same way
Congress' language was

That language is simply not --

QUESTION:

Yes, but Raygor had any entity too

29
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and we said that was not conclusive there.

2

MR. STRAUSS:

Raygor said any claim.

That's

3

right.

4

case decided in the shadow of State sovereign immunity.

5

The Court said a constitutional doubt was created by

6

principles of State sovereign immunity.

7

That's right, Mr. Chief Justice.

But Raygor was a

As I -- as I said to Justice Scalia, Jinks

8

interpreted exactly the same language, any claim, to be

9

sufficient to allow Congress to deprive local governments

10
11
12

of an immunity that States wanted to grant them.
QUESTION:

Well, that was not the only

difference.

13

QUESTION:

No.

14

QUESTION:

I mean, there were other factors in

15
16

Jinks besides -- besides just the language, any claim.
QUESTION:

And also the fact that sovereign

17

immunity had never extended -- a State Eleventh Amendment

18

immunity had never -- had never been extended to counties.

19

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, that's of course right, Mr.

20

Chief Justice.

21

take exception with the picture painted by petitioners

22

that what -- our position here would lead to some

23

dramatic, unprecedented intrusion on State authority.

24
25

And in fact, that is the reason I want to

It's actually quite familiar for Federal law to
interfere, quote/unquote, with the relations between State

and local governments.

local governments.

3

QUESTION:

Section 1983 imposes liability on

But those are all under the

4

Fourteenth Amendment where the Thirteenth -- Fourteenth

5

Amendment altered the Federal balance with reference to

6

those.

7

That's not what's involved here.
MR. STRAUSS:

Well, I understand that the

8

Fourteenth Amendment has special significance for purposes

9

of State sovereign immunity.

I've never known the Court

10

to say that the Fourteenth Amendment has special

11

significance for purposes of Gregory against Ashcroft.

12

don't -- I don't think that -- that is a -- a --

13

QUESTION:

I

If -- if for purposes of -- will you

14

assume with me -- and I may be the only one who thinks

15

this.

16

the word any, that there's an implicit scope, and since I

17

think there's an implicit scope, I'm trying to define that

18

scope.

19

help me for you to say, well, it's clear because I don't

20

think it's clear.

21

But I think when you use words like any entity or

So I don't want to -- I mean, it's not going to

But at that point, I now want to -- to find out

22

whether -- explore what you said that, well, if we did

23

apply this to the States and their municipalities, all we

24

would really be doing is targeting laws.

25

Now, I did my best to pose some questions along

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

those lines, but I was met with the answer which strikes

2

me as a pretty good answer.

3

what you're suggesting.

4

Justice Scalia suggested one reason it was a nightmare.

5

And I'd add that in the case of private companies, this

6

statute is designed to give the private company the right

7

to enter or the right to quit.

8

municipal entity, it has the right to enter, but it could

9

never quit.

There's just no way to do

It's going to be a nightmare.

Once you apply it to a

Now, that would be bizarre.

10

MR. STRAUSS:

11

QUESTION:

No.

So given the -- the sovereign

12

immunity -- you know, the sovereign -- all -- all the

13

things we've been talking about in general, given the

14

difficulty of drawing a line, which seems virtually

15

impossible or very hard, and given the one-way ratchet I

16

just described, it can't be that Congress intended to

17

include municipal entities within the scope of the word,

18

any entity.

19

to get to the merits.

What -- what is your -- that's -- I'm trying

20

MR. STRAUSS:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes.

What's your response to that?
Yes.

I don't agree that there's a

23

one-way ratchet at all, Justice Breyer.

24

the purpose of 253(a) is to eliminate barriers to entry.

25

It's not to force anyone, private or governmental, to go

I think the --

QUESTION:

And if a -- if a local

The State -- the State cannot tell it

not to enter.
MR. STRAUSS:

The State cannot tell it not to

enter by a targeted, non-competitively neutral provision.
QUESTION:

I don't understand.

Why does it

11

matter whether it's targeted or not?

12

counties can enter into the following commercial

13

businesses.

14

telecommunications.

15

It lists seven or eight.

MR. STRAUSS:

Suppose it lists

It does not list

It -- the reason why it's targeted

16

-- targeted is what I'm using to embrace the notion stated

17

in 253(b) which preserves an enormous realm of regulatory

18

authority to the States.

19

neutral regulations that satisfy certain other criteria.

20

And that's an important part of this picture because if

21

you had 253(a) in isolation, that would -- that would

22

certainly be draconian.

23

remarkable --

25

States may enact competitively

Is that targeted or not?

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, I think that would be -- if

2

it -- if it specified certain commercial activities but

3

not others, I think that would be a difficult question.

4

The question would be is that a gerrymander --

5

QUESTION:

6

MR. STRAUSS:

That's why I asked it.

I mean --

Well, the question -- the question

7

would be a 253(b) question for the FTC in the first -- FCC

8

in the first instance.

9

QUESTION:

Well, it had nothing to do with

10

whether it's competitively neutral.

11

neutral.

12

It's competitively

Nobody can enter except these fields.
MR. STRAUSS:

I mean --

If it -- if it were a gerrymander

13

designed to keep -- really just designed to keep entities

14

out of telecommunications, it would be unacceptable.

15

QUESTION:

So we're going to have to get into

16

inquiring into whether State legislatures -- well, of

to keep them out of telecommunications because it said

these are the only fields you can get into.

20

MR. STRAUSS:

21

QUESTION:

It was designed

That's -- that --

If your question is whether it was

22

designed to keep them out of telecommunications, the

23

answer is unquestionably yes.

24

MR. STRAUSS:

QUESTION:

This -- I agree --

But -- but if you say it's okay if

they not only keep them out of telecommunications, but

2

they keep them out of a lot of other stuff as well, does

3

that make it okay?

MR. STRAUSS:

This is the question that would

5

have to come up when the FCC applied 253(b) to a public or

6

a private entity --

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. STRAUSS:

9

QUESTION:

But why should we --- public or private.

Why should we interpret a statute in

10

that awkward way, that the FCC has to make this kind of

11

factual inquiry in every case?

12

MR. STRAUSS:

I think the FCC is in that

13

business with respect to private entities anyway.

What is the -- I don't even

understand what the factual inquiry is.

MR. STRAUSS:

MR. STRAUSS:

What is it --

Well, the inquiry --

-- that the FCC would be looking for?
The inquiry -- it's 253(b).

It

says States may enact measures that are competitively

21

neutral and necessary to promote certain public

22

objectives.

MR. STRAUSS:

That is the business -- that is

3

unquestionably the business Congress put the FCC in with

respect to private entities.

5

about that.

6

QUESTION:

There is no disagreement

I see the answer to that part, which

7

is you're saying they have to do it anyway, and I

8

understand that.

9

understand it.

10

Whether -- I'm not sure I agree, but I

What about the part that it's a one-way ratchet?

11

And there I think that local governments unlike local

12

private businesses act through regulation, at least

13

normally.

14

local requirement or a local regulation, and therefore, a

15

State, State A, that does not permit its municipalities to

16

go into the business, then passes a statute that does

17

permit it, then the local council passes a regulation that

18

says we'll do it, which is now a requirement, and when

19

either tries to repeal either, they run right straight

20

into your -- to this statute forbidding it as you

21

interpret it.

22

ratchet in respect to municipalities, but not a one-way

23

ratchet in respect to private businesses.

24
25

And so the statute talks about a requirement, a

And now, that's why I say it's a one-way

MR. STRAUSS:

The reason it's not a one-way

ratchet, Justice Breyer, I think turns on the word

MR. STRAUSS:

The State could not repeal the

11

statute unless it were part of a competitively neutral

12

reorganization of local government or something like that.

13

Then it could repeal it, but it couldn't enter a targeted

14

repeal of it without running afoul -- it seems to me

15

without running afoul --

16

QUESTION:

Why -- why would Congress design such

17

a strange system where -- where the municipality can get

18

in and then get out, but the State can't allow the

19

municipality to get in and then decide, no, we want to

allow them to get out?

MR. STRAUSS:

QUESTION:

23

MR. STRAUSS:

I --

It's just bizarre.
I think it applies -- I think for

5

implicit in that sense, in the -- in the ordinary meaning

6

of those words -- saw them as another source of

competition.

QUESTION:

That's why municipalities

Just so I understand you, a State can

have to grant them the power to enter into -- into

telecommunications activity.

MR. STRAUSS:

13

QUESTION:

14
15

Yes.

Right?
Yes, that's right.

It does not have to grant them that

power.
MR. STRAUSS:

Well, the -- the restraint is the

16

competitively neutral language which will ordinarily allow

17

municipalities to say -- the States to say, look, here's

18

what you can do and here's what you can't do --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. STRAUSS:

Right.
-- provided they aren't acting in

21

a way that is competitively non-neutral with respect to

telecommunications.

QUESTION:

Right, but -- but once they have let

24

them get into telecommunications, it's -- it's only the

25

municipality that can decide to get out of it.

MR. STRAUSS:

No.

The State could repeal the

2

authority if it does it, again, in a competitively neutral

3

way.

units of local government or if a State decides to say,

5

okay, we are assigning special functions to municipal

governments.

If a State decided, for example, to abolish all

Okay, but -- but the municipality

itself can say we're going to get out of

telecommunications.

MR. STRAUSS:

QUESTION:

12

Yes.

The State cannot say no -- no

municipality shall do telecommunications.

MR. STRAUSS:

That's right.

can decide for itself because then it's not prohibiting

anyone from doing anything.

QUESTION:

It's simply making a

Mr. Strauss, may I go back and ask a

variant on Justice Breyer's question, assuming that there

19

is some implicit limitation on -- on the scope of any

straight, is the -- is the drafting history in this case,

and I'd like you to tell me whether I have got the facts

1

As I understand it, at least the Senate version

2

of the original bill had a provision in it that

3

affirmative -- expressly provided that any existing

4

utility, whatever its object of service, could go into the

5

telecommunications business.

6

out at one point in your brief, this would be -- this

7

would be good for your argument because a lot of those

8

utilities are municipal utilities.

9

And this, as -- as you point

As I understand it, in the -- in the conference

10

committee, that language was, in fact, removed entirely,

11

and subsequent to its removal in the conference committee

12

report, there were references to any private entity being

13

able to go into the telecommunications business but not

14

the old, pre-conference committee references to -- to any

15

-- any public as well as private entity.

16

That suggests to me, the -- the combination of

17

the drafting change and the conference committee report,

18

that the implicit scope they were getting at was an

19

implicit scope that says any entity is a reference to

20

private, not public.

21
22
23

What -- are my facts straight, and if so, what
-- what's your response to that argument?
MR. STRAUSS:

Two points, Justice Souter.

24

First, I think it is common ground that Congress did

25

envision utilities as among the any entities.

And the --

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the likely reason Congress didn't spell that out was that

2

it was already included in the notion any entity, and

3

Congress didn't want to begin spelling out specifics and

run --

7

QUESTION:

So you say the -- the excision was a

redundancy excision.
MR. STRAUSS:

Yes, that's right.

And I think

8

there is no dispute that not only that utilities are among

9

entities, but that Congress really saw utilities as a

10
11

primary source of -- of competition.
QUESTION:

Okay.

The answer to that I think is

12

in -- in part a response to something in your brief.

13

mentioned that the original House and the original Senate

14

reports were speaking, among others, expressly of -- of

15

public entities.

16

didn't look myself.

17

the briefs.

18

report -- after this excision, which is arguably just a

19

redundancy excision, the conference committee report

20

started using the adjective private entities rather than

21

public entities as being subject to this kind of universal

22

preemption.

23

merely a redundancy excision?

24
25

You

As I understand it -- and again, I
I just got this from -- from one of

As I understand it, the conference committee

Doesn't that nix the theory that it was

MR. STRAUSS:

The conference committee report, I

believe, Justice Souter, used the word private to describe

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

-- in describing the sort of competition it believed would

2

be brought about.

3

committee report was then incorporated almost verbatim in

4

the preamble to the statute, but the word private was left

5

out when it was transferred to the statute so that the

6

word private that does occur prominently in the conference

7

committee report -- I agree with that -- dropped out of

8

the statute, which simply talks about encouraging

9

competition.

10

That passage from the conference

QUESTION:

Okay.

What we're left with, it seems

11

to me, is -- is at least -- maybe let's call it tension

12

between the conference committee report and the preamble

13

language which was then inserted.

14

perfect situation to provide -- to -- to apply a Gregory

15

kind of rule, saying when we're not sure what they meant,

16

we want them to spell it out more clearly before we

17

conclude that they, in effect, are -- are limiting the --

18

the power of a -- of a State to determine what its

19

municipalities can do?

21

MR. STRAUSS:

And isn't that a

Isn't this a good situation for a

I think the ambiguity to which

Gregory refers -- I mean, I don't think.

it is clear the ambiguities to which Gregory refers is

MR. STRAUSS:

2

QUESTION:

And --

And -- and maybe what I'm saying is

3

we -- we ought to -- those of us who would look into the

4

-- the legislative history, as I would, maybe ought to

5

take advantage of a slightly broader Gregory rule.

6

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, the -- the case I think that

7

would stand in the way more than any other perhaps --

8

well, many would I think, but the clearest example I can

9

think of is Yeskey where the -- the question in Yeskey

10

whether the ADA, the Americans with Disabilities Act,

11

applied to inmates of State prisons.

12

that prisons were special and that the Gregory rule

13

applied to legislation that assertedly reached prisons.

14

The Court assumed

The Court also assumed that Congress never

15

specifically contemplated that prison inmates would be

16

covered, and it said, nonetheless, unanimously that if the

17

language -- the language is something like State

18

instrumentalities -- if the language included prisons,

19

Gregory was satisfied.

20

QUESTION:

Isn't the difference, though -- and I

21

-- I see your argument.

22

that case we didn't have anything in the history either of

23

the drafting or of the legislative consideration of the

24

statute that suggested that there really was an -- an

25

argument each way as -- as to whether they -- they were --

They simply didn't deal with -- with that situation at

all, and they used absolute kind of -- of language.

The drafting certainly could have
There is a

In other words, we've -- we've got a -- a

MR. STRAUSS:

Justice Souter, I guess the

13

difficulty I'd have with that approach in general would be

14

it has to be common for there to be this sort of

15

uncertainty in legislative history with feints in a

16

certain direction and withdrawals for reasons that are

17

difficult to -- to fathom.

18

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I grant you that, but when

19

-- when the -- when the issue relates to the kind of State

20

sovereignty issue that -- that Gregory addresses, that's a

21

good reason for having a Gregory rule.

22

MR. STRAUSS:

Well, but as to the legislative

23

history, I think that sort of uncertainty is going to be

24

easy to generate, and what we do have here -- in addition

25

to any entity, what we do have here, not just in the

1

legislative history, but on the face of the statute, is,

as I said, agreement I think all around that utilities are

prominent among the entities that Congress envisioned.

4

think that's completely clear.

5

QUESTION:

I

But would you also say that the

6

legislative history makes it pretty clear that there's a

7

distinction in meaning between the term private entity on

8

the one hand and the term entity on the other hand, and

the statute used the term entity?

All the purposes the

And the way to Chevronize, Justice Breyer, to

15

use your term, is by saying that these -- that

municipalities are entities, but that these admittedly

17

somewhat difficult issues about what special problems do

municipalities pose, those should be handled under 253(b),

19

which is what Congress had in mind.

20

the States can enact laws so that there can be licensing

requirements and basic fitness requirements and various

22

kinds of regulation --

That's -- of course,

You say -- you say that that's -- I

I don't think that that is unambiguously within the

12

statute at all.

13

You're not willing to say that -- that

That would certainly

You -- you insist that we derive this very subtle

What's -- what the unambiguous choices are are

14

that the States are not included or that the States are

included, and that means that -- that the States cannot

exclude counties or, for that matter, even departments of

17

the State government itself from entering into the

18

telecommunications business.

19

But if you're not willing to embrace that, it seems to me

20

you are arguing that the statute is ambiguous.

21

MR. STRAUSS:

That would be unambiguous.

As -- as to 253(a), Justice

22

Scalia, I am absolutely embracing that.

23

embracing the notion -- and maybe I disagree with Justice

directly.

was that that law required States to give their judges --

5

their judges life tenure, a major structural issue.

6

the Court said, well, if they had stopped at employees,

maybe they would be giving judges life tenure, but they

said employees at the policymaking level and that's just

too ambiguous for us to think Congress was doing such a

11

In Gregory, Congress passed an antiThe claim

And

dramatic thing to the structure of State government.
This is nothing like that.

This -- this statute

12

simply says that among the universe of entrants that we

13

want in this robust, wide-open, newly competitive field of

14

telecommunications, if municipal corporations, true to

15

their roots as corporations, want to get into this

16

business, the States can't keep them out except if they're

17

doing the kinds of regulation that States can reasonably

18

do to private and public corporations alike.

19

to me not only a coherent reading of the statute, not only

20

one that is consistent with what everyone agrees is the

21

very dramatic pro-competitive turn that the 1996

22

Telecommunications Act took, but also one that really is

23

not a significant incursion on State sovereignty,

certainly not an unprecedented incursion on State

sovereignty.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. FELDMAN

17

ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL PETITIONERS

18

MR. FELDMAN:

I'd like to contrast this case

19

with the Yeskey case, which came up during Mr. Strauss'

20

argument.

21

Disabilities Act referred to public entities, I think, and

22

then it defined them as including any department of the

23

State.

24

specifically considered that it was going to intrude

25

deeply, as Justice Scalia said, in State government, and

In the Yeskey case, the Americans with

Once -- that meant that in that act, Congress had

it had made the decisions of how to do it and the whole --

2

in fact, title II of the act is designed to -- to tailor

3

that, exactly how Congress wanted to.

In this statute, there's no indication that
Congress crossed that initial dividing line and wanted -QUESTION:

Well, Mr. Strauss points to

7

subsection (b) of the statute as indicating Congress did

8

contemplate giving some leeway.

9

MR. FELDMAN:

Yes, Congress did contemplate

10

giving some leeway to the States when it was competitively

11

neutral, but the question of what competitive neutrality

12

means in this context is not an easy one.

13

And -- and I'd like to add that if Congress had

14

had to take the -- do what it did in Yeskey and -- and

15

decide yes, we do want this to apply to the States, it

16

might have occurred to Congress that they were going to

17

have to think about exactly what that means, applying a

18

statute like this to State governments that grant their

19

political subdivisions different kinds of powers in

20

different kinds of ways.

21

that first choice that it consciously wanted to intrude on

22

State -- State sovereignty the way the Eighth Circuit

23

held, and therefore it never answered those other

24

questions.

25

QUESTION:

Congress didn't -- never made

What is the rationale for saying a

1

municipal utility, a wholly owned electric company, wholly

2

owned by the city, that's okay?

3

the State can't stop that from going into the

4

telecommunications, but it can stop the municipal

5

corporation.

6

MR. FELDMAN:

That doesn't matter --

Well, I mean, that isn't at issue

7

in this case, but the FCC's rationale is that insofar as

8

under State law you have a thing that is treated just like

9

a private corporation, it's -- it's an entity.

That's

10

exactly who Congress was clearly and directly and most

11

importantly targeting this law at.

12

-- if it's a municipally owned utility that is really

13

treated like the political subdivision of the State, as

14

they are in Missouri, then that would be different because

15

that would raise these other questions, and Congress had

16

never made the decision that it wants to intrude on --

17

really in an unprecedented way, on the authority of the

18

political subdivisions.

It's -- it's where the

States decide to give --
