ORAL ARGUMENT OF NARDA PIERCE

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MS. PIERCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

11

To preserve freedom of conscience for all

12

its citizens in matters of religious faith and

13

belief, Washington's constitution limits the

14

involvement of government.

15

ability to regulate religious activities and to fund

16

religious activities.

17

QUESTION:

It limits both the

Do you think the fact that that

18

provision is in Washington's constitution makes it

19

different than, say, if it were in a -- simply in a

20

statute?

21

MS. PIERCE:

Mr. Chief Justice, the

22

recognition that this Court has given to a state

23

constitution, as opposed to a statute, is that it is

24

adopted by all of the voters of the state.

25

both the constitution and the state laws are subject

However,

1

to Federal constitutional provisions.

2

is our --

3

QUESTION:

At issue today

Is -- is it a program at issue

4

here that provides basically money to the student to

5

be spent as the student wishes?

6

program in that sense?

7

MS. PIERCE:

Is it like a voucher

Justice O'Connor, the Promise

8

Scholarship is to be provided to the student for

9

purposes of educational expenses and they're required

10

to use it for certain educational expenses.

11

purpose of the Promise Scholarship established by the

12

legislature is to strengthen the length between --

13

the link between K-12 education and higher education,

14

and in a recognition --

15

QUESTION:

The

Well, I'm just trying to find

16

out how it works, whether it's like a voucher

17

program, you give the money to the student and the

18

student decides how to use it.

19

MS. PIERCE:

It -- it works like a voucher

20

program to the extent that it's for educational

21

expenses.

22

voucher programs, but the student is required to use

23

it for those educational expenses.

24
25

I'm not familiar with the specifics of

It is not, for example, like a paycheck,
where a person has those funds as their private funds

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and can dedicate those to any uses that they choose.

2

And that's a key point under the Washington

3

constitution, because article I, section 11 says that

4

public funds shall not be applied to religious

5

worship, exercise, or instruction --

6
7
8
9

QUESTION:

How -- how many states have

similar provisions in their constitutions or laws?
MS. PIERCE:

It varies, Justice O'Connor,

according to the particular provisions.

This

10

provision refers to not using public funds for

11

religious instruction.

12

no public funds shall be spent at schools under

13

sectarian influence.

14

the neighborhood of 36 states who have some

15

provisions relating to use of public funds for

16

religious instruction, but those vary.

17

QUESTION:

We also have a provision that

I - I believe it's something in

They were all adopted at about

18

the same time, weren't these so-called Blaine

19

Amendments?

20

MS. PIERCE:

Your Honor, this is not the

21

Blaine Amendment.

22

those that refer to use of public funds in schools

23

under sectarian control.

24

provision of the Washington constitution.

25

article IX, section 4, and that was required by the

The so-called Blaine Amendment are

enabling act that provided for our statehood, but

2

this is a different provision.

3

was separate and apart, that was debated, that was

4

added to Washington's constitution as a separate

5

provision.

It's a provision that

6

QUESTION:

And was that --

7

QUESTION:

So this was add -- this was

8

added after Washington was admitted in 1889?

9

MS. PIERCE:

No, Your -- Mr. Chief

10

Justice, I'm sorry -- it was at the same time of

11

adoption, but it was not the provision that was

12

required by the --

13

QUESTION:

14

MS. PIERCE:

The enabling.
-- enabling act.

It was not

15

in the original proposed constitution set before the

16

framers.

17

constitutional convention, that's where this language

18

was added.

19

And during the course of that

And I know, referring to the Blaine

20

Amendments, there's been much made in the briefs of

21

whether or not those amendments stemmed from

22

anti-Catholic motivation.

23

evidence in Washington that there was any discussion,

24

any evidence of anti-Catholic motive.

25

There's certainly no

In Washington, both article I, section 11

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and article IX, section 4, which is -- more directly

2

stems from the Blaine Amendment, Federal level,

3

they've always been implemented in a

4

non-discriminatory manner, prohibiting both the

5

practice of any religion of any sort in our public

6

schools, as well as any funding for private sectarian

7

schools.

8
9
10
11

QUESTION:

But what if -- what if a state

prohibited only the study of theology from a Catholic
perspective?

Would that survive?

MS. PIERCE:

No, Your Honor, we don't

12

believe it would.

13

is prohibited public funds for religious instruction

14

wherever it occurs, including in a college --

15

But what the state has done here

QUESTION:

Wait.

How -- how do you

16

reconcile that?

17

seems to me that if you say it does not violate the

18

religion clauses to prohibit the use for any

19

religious instruction whatever, you would also have

20

to say that it does not violate the religion clauses

21

to say no public funds shall be spent for Jewish

22

theology studies.

23

That's what I don't understand.

It

Why -- why -- I mean, the state is not

24

permitted to discriminate between religious sects,

25

but it's just as much not permitted to discriminate

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

between religion in general and non-religion.

2

can you possibly -- I mean, if we say that -- that

3

you can do this, it seems to me, we have to say you

4

-- you can also prohibit Jewish studies.

5

MS. PIERCE:

6

QUESTION:

7

MS. PIERCE: -- I don't believe that

So how

No, Justice Scalia --

Why not?

8

follows.

9

and for religious purposes is a line that's been

The line between funds for secular purposes

10

recognized by this Court in various funding cases and

11

in reviewing government activities.

12

recognizes both the values of the Establishment

13

Clause and the values of the Free Exercise Clause.

14

It's a line that

Here, simply because the State of

15

Washington is extending those values of the

16

Establishment Clause beyond direct funding into

17

indirect funding does not convert those values into

18

hostility.

There's still the values --

19

QUESTION:

20

MS. PIERCE:

21

It's -- it's treating --- of protecting religious

freedom.

22

QUESTION:

-- it's treating religion

23

differently from non-religion.

24

anything you like and get it subsidized except

25

religion.

You can study

Why is that not violating the principle of

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

neutrality?

2

MS. PIERCE:

It is treating religion

3

different from a realm in which religion -- religious

4

belief or non-belief does not enter what we refer to

5

as secular studies.

6

QUESTION:

It's -You're making the -- are you --

7

are you making the -- or is Washington making the

8

distinction between training in how to be religious,

9

training as it were in the practice of some -- of a

10

religion that leads to the truth, on the one hand,

11

and study about what people believe on the other

12

hand.

13

religious versus what religions believe.

14

distinction?

I thought that was the distinction, how to be

15

MS. PIERCE:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. PIERCE:

18

I meant to articulate.

19

QUESTION:

Is that the

Yes, Your Honor.

Okay.
And that was the distinction

So, I take it, then, if it

20

that's the distinction, you would -- you would agree

21

that if Washington funded a school of atheism, but

22

wouldn't fund a school like this one, that there

23

would be a violation of one or both of the clauses?

24
25

MS. PIERCE:

Yes, Justice Souter, because

whenever you enter into the realm of faith or belief,

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

whenever you try to affect someone's belief in that

2

realm, that has been a particularly protected realm

3

of individual conscience, that becomes religious,

4

whether it's non-belief or belief.

5

QUESTION:

It's when you --

But it's the difference between

6

being religious and studying religion.

7

line, isn't it?

8
9

MS. PIERCE:

That's your

Yes, Your Honor, and I

believe that's the Court's line.

It's the line

10

that's been drawn in many of the direct funding cases

11

of this Court, to teach about religion --

12

QUESTION:

Can -- can you not study

13

atheism under this statute?

14

course debunking, debunking all religious belief.

15

Would that be prohibited?

16

this statute?

17

the funding of that?

18

Suppose there is a

Would that be funded under

I don't see any -- any prohibition of

MS. PIERCE:

Justice Scalia, I think when

19

the statute is read in conjunction with Washington

20

case law, and particularly the Calvary Bible

21

Presbyterian Church case, that the definition --

22

QUESTION:

What does the statute say?

23

don't see how it can possibly apply to that.

24

does it say?

25

MS. PIERCE:

I

What

Well, the statute says that

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

no aid shall be awarded to any student pursuing a

2

degree in theology.

3

QUESTION:

4

MS. PIERCE:

5

QUESTION:

6
7
8
9

In theology.
But --

Now, is -- is a degree in

atheism a degree in theology?
MS. PIERCE:

I believe it would be under

the interpretation -QUESTION:

That would be a question, would

10

it not, for the state supreme court to decide?

11

may decide it needs to carry that limitation in order

12

to be compatible with the Free Exercise Clause.

13

MS. PIERCE:

14

QUESTION:

It

I --

And I think that certainly the

15

Free Exercise Clause answers the question, can you

16

give it to the Catholics but not to the Jews.

17

that's -- that's not an issue.

18

MS. PIERCE:

So

Yes, Justice Ginsburg, and I

19

think that the Washington Supreme Court would

20

interpret it that way, not only to be consistent with

21

the Free Exercise Clause, but to be consistent with

22

its own state constitutional provision and its

23

purposes, which is to not use public funds for

24

instruction in the realm of faith and belief and --

25

QUESTION:

What cases do you cite for the

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

proposition that you're asserting that the -- that

2

the Free Exercise Clause or the Establishment Clause

3

applies differently to discrimination between

4

different religions than it does to discrimination

5

between religion in general and non-religion?

6

-- what cases do you cite for that distinction?

7

MS. PIERCE:

What

What we cite, Your Honor, is

8

that line between the secular and the religious

9

activity.

I believe it's the line that was drawn in

10

the Schempp case, referring to the study about

11

religion versus the study of religion, which is not,

12

in our view, discrimination in the classic sense of

13

that word.

14

QUESTION:

No, but that doesn't -- that --

15

the issue there was whether you were discriminating

16

against religion or not.

17

prohibiting study about religion, that isn't the

18

question here.

19

And since you are not

The question is, assuming you are

20

discriminating between religion and non-religion, you

21

can't study theology but you can study anything else,

22

what is there in our cases that says that is okay,

23

although it would not be okay to distinguish between

24

Jewish studies or Catholic studies or Protestant

25

studies and other studies?

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

I don't know a single case that says the

2

principle of neutrality somehow applies differently

3

so long as you're discriminating against all religion

4

than it does when you're just discriminating against

5

one denomination.

6

Did you have a case?

MS. PIERCE:

Well, Your Honor, in the

7

context of this Court's aid to education under the

8

Establishment Clause, and Mitchell v. Helms is a

9

classic example, there's a distinction between

10

providing materials, educational materials that are

11

to be used in secular education, as opposed to those

12

materials that might be diverted to religious,

13

ideological education and --

14

QUESTION:

But that's -- that's the

15

Establishment Clause, isn't it, in Mitchell against

16

Helms?

17

MS. PIERCE:

Yes, it is, Your Honor, and

18

-- and we believe the same -- many of the same values

19

underlie the Washington constitution.

20

believe that the distinction is made invalid because

21

it is extended to indirect funding and doesn't apply

22

only to direct funding.

23

QUESTION:

And we don't

Well, I wanted to ask you about

24

these values.

25

have done exactly what he in fact did if only he did

As I understand, this student could

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

not declare a double major.

2

of these religious perspective courses, if only he'd

3

called his major business administration, which in

4

fact it was because he had the credits for that, too.

5

That would have been permissible.

6

or am I incorrect?

7

MS. PIERCE:

He could have taken all

Is that correct,

Well, the statute focuses on

8

whether a student is pursuing a degree in theology

9

and -- and --

10

QUESTION:

If -- suppose that he pursued a

11

degree in business administration and yet, ancillary

12

to that or as options, took all of these other

13

courses.

14
15
16

Could he have had the aid that he seeks?
MS. PIERCE:

Yes, Your Honor, we think

that could have happened, but it's an unlikely -QUESTION:

All right.

What is the state's

17

interest in denying him aid simply because he

18

declares a double major?

19

MS. PIERCE:

I believe the reason the

20

legislature has focused on the nature of the degree

21

program is because it's an inherently religious

22

program, and if they were to --

23

QUESTION:

What is the state's interest in

24

denying him funds simply because of the way he labels

25

the major he chooses, if all the other instructions,

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

all the other elements of the case are the same?

2

takes all the same courses, he has all the same

3

commitment as a Christian, and yet he's denied the

4

relief in one case and given it -- the subsidy in one

5

case, and given it in the other.

6

interest in doing that?

7

MS. PIERCE:

He

What is the state's

Justice Kennedy, I think the

8

state's interest is not in that particular student,

9

but in how you administer it overall.

And the way

10

the state administers it overall, in order to avoid a

11

class-by-class, student-by-student determination, is

12

to look at the degree programs that are inherently

13

religious that have, or ask the universities actually

14

to do that --

15
16

QUESTION:

Ms. Pierce, I thought that the

QUESTION:

Well, what is the state's

--

17
18

interest in -- in denying aid for programs that are

19

inherently religious?

20

a compelling interest?

21

MS. PIERCE:

22
23

it is.

What is that interest?

Is it

Yes, Your Honor, we believe

The interest is -QUESTION:

May I ask you just to clarify

24

what I thought was the purpose of this, was that the

25

state has decided it does not want to fund the

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

training of clergymen, and it cites a long history of

2

that.

3

can with that limitation.

4

And it's tried to be as accommodating as it

I mean, certainly if what you're doing is

5

vulnerable, it would be no less vulnerable if the

6

state said, well, we won't fund that school at all

7

because it's an evangelical school.

8
9

MS. PIERCE:

Justice Ginsburg -- excuse me

-- the focus is on the religious nature of the

10

instruction.

11

the clergy and yet took a secular course of

12

education, they would not be denied funding.

13

If someone had a career goal to enter

Certainly one of the underlying values of

14

our Freedom of Religion Clauses at the Federal and

15

state level is not to require people to support the

16

promotion of a doctrine or religious belief with

17

which they may not agree, and that, returning to

18

Justice Kennedy's question, is -- is the interest.

19

The way it's implemented by Washington,

20

and it has been by Congress and by other states in

21

other contexts, is to look at that core course of

22

study because --

23

QUESTION:

But we've decided in Witters

24

that it's unnecessary to do that to conform to the

25

Establishment Clause.

1

MS. PIERCE:

2

QUESTION:

3

So, after -- after that, then

what is the state's interest at this point?

4

MS. PIERCE:

5

QUESTION:

6
7

Yes, Justice Kennedy --

Well, the state's --

Is the state's interest in

redefining the Establishment Clause?
MS. PIERCE:

No, Your Honor, but the state

8

has a different, although somewhat concurrent, scheme

9

for religious freedom, and that involves not just

10

avoiding a government endorsement of religion, which

11

is what the Establishment Clause primarily turns and

12

focuses on --

13
14

QUESTION:

But Witters said there is no

endorsement.

15

MS. PIERCE:

16

QUESTION:

17

MS. PIERCE:

18

QUESTION:

And -- and --

So you can't use that.
No, and I'm not trying to.

I still don't see what your

19

interest is, and once you do define it, I want you to

20

tell me if it's compelling, rational basis.

21

MS. PIERCE:

Okay.

Washington's interest

22

expressed in 1889 was to protect the freedom of

23

conscience of all its citizens, and that included not

24

compelling its citizens to provide enforced public

25

funds to support the promotion of religious beliefs

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

with which they may or may not agree.

2

QUESTION:

I think --

Does that mean that the state

3

can decline to provide fire protection to churches

4

and synagogues?

5
6

MS. PIERCE:

distinction has been made.

7
8

QUESTION:

11

And Washington doesn't do that,

does it?

9
10

No, Your Honor, and that

MS. PIERCE:

It does not decline that, and

there's -QUESTION:

So that -- that general public

12

benefit is extended to both religious and

13

non-religious institutions equivalently, and people

14

don't get upset about that, do they?

15

MS. PIERCE:

No, Your Honor.

I think

16

providing the essential services that include people

17

as part of our civilized community has been

18

distinguished from other kind of funding when these

19

questions are asked.

20

QUESTION:

Well, Washington's position, I

21

take it, is that, although it -- it will certainly

22

put out the fire in the church, it won't spend money

23

for the purpose of persuading people that they ought

24

to be inside the church.

25

you're making?

Is that the -- the point

MS. PIERCE:

Yes, Justice Souter.

There

2

is a distinction there and it's a distinction that's

3

been made in a variety of contexts, but --

4

QUESTION:

And you're saying that even

5

though it would not offend the Establishment Clause

6

if the state did provide this sort of funding, there

7

is still, I think your point is, there is still an

8

area within which it has a choice, even though that

9

choice may not be determined by the Establishment

10

Clause?

11

MS. PIERCE:

Yes, Your Honor, because the

12

purpose of the state constitution, which of course,

13

when it was adopted in 1889, was not viewed as

14

greater than the Establishment Clause, it was viewed

15

as the only protection for religious freedom at the

16

state level, since it wasn't until 1947 that the

17

Establishment Clause was held to apply to the states.

18

And to return to your question, Justice

19

Souter, the distinction between providing police and

20

fire services to an organization and providing

21

funding to assist in the educational purpose of that

22

organization was made in Norwood v. Harrison in this

23

Court.

24

-- for similar reasons, this Court held that

25

textbooks could not be provided to segregated schools

In the very different circumstance, but for

19
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

because that would aid the discrimination of those

2

schools in violation of --

QUESTION:

Well, isn't that an

Establishment Clause issue?

MS. PIERCE:

QUESTION:

7

It's been litigated under the

Establishment Clause, right?

In that particular --

MS. PIERCE:

The provision of the -- the

aid --

10

QUESTION:

Providing textbooks or other

11

aid to religious schools.

12

Establishment Clause challenges, and we had a -- the

13

Witters case from your state, and determined that the

14

Establishment Clause is not violated by giving aid to

15

the blind, which is used then to study for the

16

ministry, right?

17

Those have been

MS. PIERCE: Yes, Justice O'Connor, and

18

that's because under the Establishment Clause, the

19

question is, is the government endorsing religion?

20

Under Washington's article I, section 11, the

21

question is, is -- are public funds being used for

22

the promotion or -- of religious belief or disbelief

23

and --

But do you -- do you think that

QUESTION:

Ms. Pierce, may I ask you a

2

question there on how you draw the line?

Because I

3

want to get clear on one thing, and it was raised in

4

effect by the questions earlier about the Blaine

5

Amendment, I guess, but is my understanding correct

6

that the State of -- that this clause that we are

7

dealing with here, and nothing else for that matter

8

in the Washington law, forbids the state from paying

9

-- we'll call it a tuition voucher here -- that is

10

going to a sectarian school like this one, so long as

11

it's not being used for theological education?

12
13
14

MS. PIERCE:

Justice Souter, there's a

distinction in our state constitution -QUESTION:

No, but isn't the answer, there

15

is nothing that forbids that?

16

back to Justice Kennedy's question, if this same

17

student said, I want to study business and I want to

18

study it at this sectarian school, there would be no

19

impediment in Washington law to paying him the -- or

20

giving him the voucher or whatever you call it and

21

letting him spend it at this sectarian school?

22

that correct?

23

MS. PIERCE:

In other words, going

That's true at the higher

education level.

QUESTION:

But isn't it also true he could

2

even take the same courses and get it as long as he

3

didn't declare his major until he was a junior?

4

MS. PIERCE:

Your Honor, we -- the statute

5

says pursuing a degree in theology, so I think it

6

should be properly read and is properly read by

7

Northwest College as a student who is, during the

8

academic terms that are funded, working toward that

9

degree in theology.

10

QUESTION:

But I -- I just want to be sure

11

I understand how it works in response to Justice

12

Kennedy's inquiry.

13

taken all or most of the religious courses he did

14

take if he'd only declared a different major or

15

postponed the time when he declared his major?

Is it not true that he could have

16

MS. PIERCE:

17

QUESTION:

I believe he --

Which has a double aspect.

In

18

one hand, as Justice Kennedy points out, the state

19

interest doesn't seem all that compelling there, but

20

on the other hand, the burden on him is also pretty

21

slight, because all he had to was take a -- just

22

manage his curriculum a little differently.

23

MS. PIERCE:

24

QUESTION:

25

Yes, Your Honor.

I --

And -- and I just want to know,

am I correct that he could have taken either all or

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

substantially all of the religion -- religious

2

courses and qualified for the scholarship if he just

3

declared a different major?

4

MS. PIERCE:

You're partially correct,

5

Justice Stevens.

6

the same religion courses.

7

declaring your major later is what meets the purpose

8

of the statute.

9
10

I think he could have taken some of

The statute says are you pursuing --

QUESTION:

Wasn't he counseled -- wasn't

he counseled specifically by the school to be honest?

11

MS. PIERCE:

12

QUESTION:

13

I don't think just simply

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

And not try to hide what his

purpose was, which he was perfectly open about?

14

MS. PIERCE:

15

QUESTION:

Yes, Justice Ginsburg.

And, of course, if -- if you

16

take a whole bunch of religious courses, it may be

17

they can't be counted for some other major other than

18

the -- the theology.

19

MS. PIERCE:

Well, the theology degree,

20

Your Honor, does require, I believe at Northwest, 125

21

credits, and 79 of those credits are required to be

22

in various Bible and theological courses, so I think

23

it is -- it would be possible, but unusual, for

24

another student to have those same courses and not

25

being pursuing a degree in theology.

QUESTION:

Could we go back to Justice

2

Kennedy's second part of what he was asking, because

3

it's bothering me, too.

4

well-established, whether there's a case or not, that

5

people have thought it's different when what the

6

Federal government or state government says is, what

7

we have here is a secular program, we're paying for

8

secular programs, whether it's schools or social

9

services or any one of a million things, or if it

I think it's absolutely

10

were to say, well, it's a Baptist program, but not a

11

Catholic program.

12

I think if they said the second, they'd

13

have to pass something like strict scrutiny as far as

14

their reasons are concerned.

15

the first, so far I don't think they would have to

16

pass anything like that kind of test, but that's the

17

question.

18

I think if they said

And I think that Justice Kennedy was

19

saying, very well, what is the test?

20

scrutiny should you give under the Equal Protection

21

Clause, where what the state has done is said we have

22

a secular spending program.

23

because if the atheist is a program which concerns

24

principles that in the mind of the atheist are

25

similar to those that are religious in the mind of a

That's not what I'm talking

I'm talking about just a regular secular

aid program.

6

the basis of?

7

What do we judge that distinction on
What kind of a test?

MS. PIERCE:

Justice Breyer, I believe it

8

is a rational basis test, that is, it is a neutral

9

line, it's a recognized line between the secular that

10

does not involve the realm of belief and faith, and a

11

religious that does.

12

QUESTION:

I didn't think this was an

13

Equal Protection Clause case at all.

14

was -- the challenge was freedom of religion.

MS. PIERCE:

The Free Exercise Clause of the

First Amendment?

case, so maybe it's totally different under free

2

exercise, but you see the question.

3

MS. PIERCE:

4

QUESTION:

5

Yes, and Justice Breyer --

And your answer's rational

basis.

6

MS. PIERCE:

7

QUESTION:

Yes.

Rational -- you -- you think

8

there's a difference in free exercise if what the

9

state says is, we are burdening the free exercise of

10

all religions, as opposed to, we are burdening the

11

free exercise of one particular religion.

12

there's a different -- a different standard?

13

I would ask for the case that -- that suggests that.

14

MS. PIERCE:

You think
Again,

Justice Scalia, in the first

15

instance, this case involves application of public

16

funds in a funding program, and we believe that the

17

principle that a state's decision not to fund the

18

exercise of a fundamental right is not a burden on

19

that right, it's not an infringement on that right.

20

All that the State of Washington has done here is

21

decline to fund theology studies --

22

QUESTION:

Certainly in our -- in our

23

Rosenberger case there was a rational basis for what

24

the University of Virginia did, but we held it

25

violated the Free Exercise Clause.

26
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MS. PIERCE:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, and

2

the purpose of the public forum principles that were

3

applied in Rosenberger are to protect the open public

4

forum.

5

that that was a forum for the publication, for the

6

expression of ideas, and that the expression of those

7

ideas in that open public forum would be incomplete

8

if certain viewpoints were excluded.

There the Court specifically acknowledged

9

But certainly the purpose of the Promise

10

Scholarship is not to open a public forum.

11

akin to the American Library Association case, where

12

Internet access was provided, not to provide a forum

13

for the Web publishers, but to promote education and

14

learning.

15

QUESTION:

It's more

You think there is a -- a

16

rational basis suffices for the state to prohibit

17

this student from declaring one of his legitimate

18

majors?

19

MS. PIERCE:

We believe -- yes, Your

20

Honor, we believe there is a rational basis to not

21

fund religious instruction wherever it occurs,

22

including a theology course.

23

QUESTION:

Is it essentially your position

24

that not everything that is compatible with the

25

Establishment Clause, not everything that the state

27
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

could do under the Establishment Clause, it must do

2

under the Free Exercise?

3

position, how do you define the space in between

4

those two where the state has a choice?

5

MS. PIERCE:

And if that's your

That is our position.

We

6

don't think states should be in constitutional

7

pincers where whatever they're allowed to do under

8

the Establishment Clause or required to do,

9

particularly given the history that states have come

10

to their own path to religious freedom.

11

And I think applying the various

12

principles on when you burden the exercise of

13

religious freedom leads you to the latitude in this

14

area.

15

or burden a fundamental right, and that's all that

16

the state has done.

Here, not providing funding does not infringe

MR. SEKULOW:

You're

reviewing the Promise Scholarship program, the state

then decided that in fact there would be a

what the case turns on.

14

what one, what a state is permitted to do, what it's

MR. SEKULOW:

QUESTION:

Yes.

Suppose the -- the state would

say, we are going to fund professional education,

lawyers, doctors, architects, engineers, but we're

not going to fund people who are -- who are in a

fall also?

3

Would that qualify or would that

MR. SEKULOW:

Well, I think a program that

4

were to just limit it to specific professions would

5

not necessarily have to go towards theology.

Justice Ginsburg, there is a shortage of nurses right

now.

program includes all professions, save one, and --

13

and that is ministry.

14

MR. SEKULOW:

Well, if it was as you

15

described it, I would be here arguing the same point

16

in this context.

17

the professions and then say we are going to fund

18

everything but those students studying theology would

19

be again that religious classification, and I would

think unless the state could establish its compelling

21

governmental interest --

22

The idea that you would list all of

QUESTION:

As I -- as I understand your

answer to Justice O'Connor, if we decide in your

favor, we necessarily commit ourselves to the

proposition that an elementary and secondary school

narrower issue than that.

college student who is being required to surrender

6

his -- his conscientious beliefs by declaring a major

7

which otherwise would have been completely funded by

8

the school, and I -- I just don't see any interest in

9

doing that.

It -- it seems

Here we have a -- a

It seems to me a -- a very severe

10

violation of -- of religious conscience.

I think

11

that's quite different from an overall neutrality

12

principle, which would foreclose this Court on the

13

voucher issue.

14

MR. SEKULOW:

15

agree, Justice Kennedy.

16

to go that far here.

But certainly that's what

Well, I don't think -- I
I don't think the Court has

you're arguing.

I mean, your -- your brief and your

21

MR. SEKULOW:

22

QUESTION:

If --

Now, have we -- have we, in

23

looking at funding issues, have we dealt differently

24

with the requirement of funding something out of

25

public funds than for other purposes?

MR. SEKULOW:

Well -- well, certainly in

2

the -- in the direct aid cases and in the

3

Establishment Clause context, but this is very

4

similar to the Witters program, so there is not the

5

countervailing Establishment Clause issue, and that's

6

what I was going to address, Justice Kennedy.

7

Depending on how the voucher program is established

8

would depend on whether the religious institutions

9

would be included.

For instance, again I go to the

10

eligibility issue.

Here, Northwest College was an

11

accredited institution --

12

QUESTION:

Okay.

Let's assume that all

13

the public schools and all the private schools,

14

including all religious private schools are -- are

15

accredited in whatever way the state accredits them,

16

and that the criterion, apart from religious

17

education, is simply that the ultimate recipient of

18

the voucher has to be an accredited school.

19

to me, following Justice O'Connor's question, that

20

the argument that would be made in any case in which

21

a state says we will -- we will allow a voucher to be

22

spent in a private school, but not a private

23

religious school is the same argument that Justice

24

Kennedy was suggesting a moment ago, and that is that

25

the religious student must somehow surrender a

It seems

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

conscientious belief and go from a religious school

2

and seek to be enrolled in a non-religious private

3

school or a public one to get the voucher.

4

don't see why that argument would not be just as

5

applicable there as the argument that you are making

6

here.

7

MR. SEKULOW:

And I

Justice Souter, in this

8

particular -- using that example, here the school is

9

a qualified school.

10

admittedly has a religious affiliation, it isn't --

11
12

The Northwest College, which

QUESTION:

Sure.

That's a wash.

Everybody agrees.

13

MR. SEKULOW:

14

QUESTION:

It's their major.

Everybody -- the only criterion

15

is, will we fund religious training in how to be

16

religion -- religious -- or will we not?

17

fact, a -- a similar argument would be made as

18

between the -- the religious school that teaches

19

religion, and the private school that doesn't teach

20

religion.

21

MR. SEKULOW:

And in

In this context, the way the

22

program is implemented within that hypothetical and

23

within the facts here, here students can take these

24

very same courses in religion that Josh Davey --

25

QUESTION:

Well, that may show that the

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

state draws a kind of a funny line.

2

-- a bad job of line drawing, and I -- I have to

3

admit, I'm not quite sure why they draw it the way

4

they do, but on -- on the -- on the basic proposition

5

that the state raises as -- as its position here,

6

that it will not fund ministerial education or

7

education in how to be religious versus funding other

8

kinds of training, the argument, it seems to me, from

9

the Free Exercise Clause would be the same in the

10

voucher case as the argument that you are making

11

here.

12

MR. SEKULOW:

Maybe it was a

If in fact the programs were

13

put forward this way with the accreditation as you

14

suggested, and there is no countervailing

15

Establishment Clause issue and the eligibility issue

of the school is met, yes, I wouldn't see the --

20

submajor from a religious viewpoint.

QUESTION:

Mr. Sekulow --

23

do you know?

24

25

would allow students to go to any private school, you

2

religious schools?

3

MR. SEKULOW:

Twenty-five states have

4

voucher-type programs that have no restrictions at

5

all as long as it's an accredited institution, so

6

that's the -- usually the standard.

7

any school that's accredited.

8

and it's about a half-dozen, as I said, Justice

9

Scalia, it's a little bit of a moving target because

10

policies change, that actually have this prohibition

11

for religious education, and even within some of

12

those states, the programs are inconsistent.

13

have different type of financial aid programs here.

14

They can go to

There are some states,

They'll

In this particular situation, and the way

15

this particular program is implemented, though,

Joshua Davey had already made, Justice Stevens, his

17

declaration of a major before he was notified he was

18

disqualified.

19

notification until October, some two months after he

20

rolled -- enrolled.

21

The state didn't do the formal

QUESTION:

But I suppose he could have

22

changed his mind and taken another major in most of

23

the courses and then postponed that decision.

24

matter of conscience, he didn't do it.

25

MR. SEKULOW:

As a

It -- it was a matter of

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

conscience.

There were some students at the school

2

that did change their mind.

3

not.

4

the financial aid counselor, did state in the joint

5

appendix that she cautioned them if they are in fact

6

going to major in a degree that would be pursuing a

7

theology to tell the truth, which he clearly did

8

here.

9

already made in the sense that the state came back

10

afterwards and said oh, by the way, these group of

11

students don't qualify for this.

12

QUESTION:

But wouldn't it be --

13

QUESTION:

Am I -- am I correct or

There were two that did

Joshua Davey was one that -- and the counselor,

So his implementation of the decision was

14

incorrect that the state would fund a student who

15

majored in literature at a institution which was

16

sectarian and had instructors who taught literature

17

from a religious perspective or -- am I correct about

18

that?

19

QUESTION:

Yes.

20

QUESTION:

Well, but the state is saying,

21

I don't know if we can escape the broader ground, the

22

state's saying, look, we understand that, you know,

23

applying our standard there'll be all kinds of

24

anomalies that you can get.

25

But what we're doing by and large is to say, we don't

2

program, we'll do it subsidiary, you know, the odd

3

example doesn't matter, but people who major in

4

philosophy are likely to become priests or at least

5

spend a lot of time studying theology.

6

in theology, or they spend a lot of time studying

7

theology, that's going too far.

many administrative lines, a very crude effort to

identify those people who are taking too much of

So this is, like

their time in totally religiously-oriented matters.

11

Now, of course that's unconstitutional if

we accept your argument that the state must treat the

13

religious study the same way as any other.

14

your broad ground.

15

ground, I don't quite see at the moment how we can

16

accept the narrow one, which turns on these details

17

of the administrability of the line.

18

That's

But if we reject the broad

MR. SEKULOW:

Well, the reason that I want

19

-- let me address the latter, if I might, Justice

20

Breyer.

21

line drawing albeit may be crude on the State of

22

Washington, here is within the context of the Free

23

Exercise Clause, because here the school is an

24

eligible institution, so that's not even at issue.

25

There is no countervailing Establishment Clause issue

The reason those details matter because the

2

dealing with is a statute which on its face states

3

that a student who qualifies based on academic

4

excellence and economic need makes the decision for

5

him or herself where they're going to go to school

6

and what they're going to major in, and they can

7

major in literally the universe of courses.

8

only one exclusion.

9

a situation with a number of majors.

10

Witters foreclosed that.

QUESTION:

So all we are

There is

It's not even, Justice Ginsburg,
It's one.

Mr. Sekulow, I think that

11

Justice Breyer is getting at the same point I tried

12

to get at, and it's in part the other flip side of

13

what Justice Kennedy asked you.

14

not standing here to tell us that, oh, if they were

15

more restrictive, if they said we're simply not going

16

to fund scholarships to students who go to sectarian

17

schools, that that might be all right.

18

don't want to win on the ground of the school was too

19

generous in what it did fund.

MR. SEKULOW:

Certainly, you are

I mean, you

Well, two responses.

First,

21

the -- on the issue of the state and their

22

obligation, to recast this as a -- the state is being

23

required to fund Joshua Davey's education, I think is

-- is a miscast of the issue.

25

to employ, to develop a scholarship program that's

The state has decided

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

very broad-based and in that program they have given

2

the student the ultimate choice of where they could

3

go to school as long as it's within Washington state

4

and accredited and literally they can major in any

5

major except for one, and that is a theology

6

exclusion.

7

QUESTION:

Wouldn't be any better if they

8

said, you can go to any school except a -- a church

9

school.

10

MR. SEKULOW:

No.

I think it would raise,

11

if it's accredited I think it would raise the same

12

problem.

13

universities don't teach courses in theology and

14

religion.

15

there's a listing of the courses offered at the

16

University of Washington, and it covers a broad array

17

of religious courses, albeit from --

18

But it's not to say that the state

On pages 66 and 74 of the joint appendix,

QUESTION:

You -- you don't know of any

19

case that says that the less significant the interest

20

the state has is the more latitude it has in

discriminating against religion.

22

any case that said that?

23

MR. SEKULOW:

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

May I ask -- ask you a broader

question?

breathing space between the Establishment Clause and

the Free Exercise Clause.

or just what is your position on whether or not there

8

is such a breathing space?

A number of the briefs discussed the

The play in the joints as

it's referred to.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SEKULOW:

Yeah.
I -- I think the play in the

13

joints gives the state broad flexibility in

14

establishing the programs and -- or not establishing

15

a program at all, but to use the play in the joints

16

to not accommodate religion but rather to target

17

religion as an exclusion I think is a misuse in my

18

view of what the Court has at this point --

QUESTION:

Give me an example, any

example.

22

contend that any violation, any time there is no

violation of the Establishment Clause that then the

Free Exercise Clause would necessarily kick in?

25

MR. SEKULOW:

No, absolutely not.

I don't have -- I only have

20 minutes, so I cannot reserve any more time.

8

That's okay.

9

But I would normally be happy to.

(Laughter.)

QUESTION:

If -- if you can give me an

11

example of a case where the state can say we know we

12

can give this funding to religious schools if we want

to, but we don't want to?

where that would be legitimate on your view of free

exercise?

16

MR. SEKULOW:

Can you give any example

Sure.

Under the latter

20

hypothetical, that -- that would be our position,

21

that once you have gone into the private schools and

the school meets the neutral secular criteria, our

view would be at that point the state should be equal

and not target out religion for an exclusion, which

is precisely the viewpoint neutrality issue that we

breathing space, especially with respect to the

find entanglement or endorsement under certain

Court has said is that distinguishing -- that

discriminating against Catholics and discriminating

go over, you'd have to go over each of them and

there'd be a claim in each instance that they cannot

not a major step at all in this Court's jurisprudence

heavens that it is, that this principle as the -- I

12

think one of the questions, I think it was Justice

13

O'Connor's question, asked with respect to the

funding cases and this Court dealt specifically with

15

that in the Maher v. Roe case when it said the

QUESTION:

comes down to an argument, I think, about the

MR. OLSON:

2

QUESTION:

About -About the following

distinction.

4

look, there is a line to be drawn, not between

5

funding Catholics and Protestants or atheists or

6

what-not.

7

funding education about a religion, education that

8

says this is what Catholics believe, this is what

9

atheists believe, and on the other hand, education

The other side says, Washington says,

The line to be drawn is the line between

10

that says, this belief is valid, and you ought to go

11

out and persuade other people to hold this belief.

12

They say, that is the distinction we are trying to

13

draw.

14

neutrality criteria?

15

Why is that distinction invalid under a

MR. OLSON:

For the reason that the same

16

argument was rejected in the Rosenberger case, that

the notion of --

QUESTION:

But Rosenberger was not said --

19

the opinion in Rosenberger said these people are not

proselytizing on the one hand, how to do it, why it's

23

valid, and instruction on what people believe as a

fact on the other.

MR. OLSON:

I -- I respectfully submit

that it is, that the students in the Rosenberger that

were publishing those articles were publishing

articles that advocated belief in God.

That was -I -- I couldn't -- I couldn't

11

get four colleagues to agree with me on that, and

12

they went off on -- on another -- another course.

13

MR. OLSON:

Yeah, but the Court went on to

14

say that this was a free exercise violation as well

15

as a First Amendment violation.

16

The other point that I think is very, very

17

important with respect to that, if the state starts

18

to distinguishing between discussion of a subject and

19

proselytizing, the entanglement problem is going to

20

be enormous.

do we even bother with the -- the criterion of direct

MR. OLSON:

Because we -- we could have

No, because the line has been

4

drawn by individuals, individuals making genuinely

5

free, independent choices to make a dispensation.

6

It's like the Court's example in those cases of an

7

individual receiving a check and then deciding

8

exactly how to spend it so there's a great difference

9

between those kind of cases.

This is no different

10

than the example that Justice Scalia raised as

providing fire protection or -- or providing tax

deductions.

QUESTION:

But we've held in Witters that

5

there is no problem with that -- with that kind --

6

with that kind of subsidy.

7

MS. PIERCE:

For purposes of the

8

Establishment Clause.

9

that our state supreme court has questioned in a

And I just wanted to point out

10

dissent in the Gallway v. Grimm case, some justices

11

of our state supreme court have asked, is focusing on

12

the degree program sufficient for our state

13

constitution?

14

for it that's not yet been addressed by our court,

15

and that's to avoid that kind of class-by-class

16

determination, not necessary in Witters because there

17

the focus is, does the Establishment Clause -- is it

18

violated by government endorsement?

19

But we believe there are good reasons

But Washington does take a different

20

approach to both prongs, both twin prongs of

21

religious freedom, and this is my second point. For

22

purposes of funding, it looks beyond government

23

endorsement and looks to the freedom of conscience in

24

religious matters of a broader range of citizens,

25

including citizens who may not want to have their

1

compelled tax payments used for religious

2

instruction.

3

So it's the same principle.

It doesn't

4

become hostility to religion just because it extends

5

that one principle beyond what the Establishment

6

Clause requires.

7

Washington also puts greater restrictions on

8

government where their regulations may impact

9

someone's free exercise of their religion so that

10

unless a state -- the state can show a substantial

11

need, certain regulatory laws cannot be applied in a

12

fashion that burdened the free exercise.

13

On the other hand, the State of

The Munns v. Martin case is a classic

14

example that we have cited to the Court.

15

where historic landmark laws could not prevent a

16

church from building a pastoral center because the

17

historic landmark laws were deemed not to be

18

substantially needed by the state to protect the

19

public.

It's a case

20

So we do think there is wide latitude, and

21

my final point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that this Court

22

has accorded the states wide latitude in funding

23

decisions for the states to make their own policy

24

judgments.
