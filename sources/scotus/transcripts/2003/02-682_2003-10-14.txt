Mr. Taranto.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RICHARD G. TARANTO

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. TARANTO:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
On the facts alleged, Trinko cannot sustain its

11
12

complaint unless the Court newly recognizes a section 2

13

duty of a monopolist to turn over its sales to rivals by

14

sharing its assets at specially discounted prices, that

15

is, a duty to dismantle itself.
Our argument is that that hasn't ever been a

16
17

section 2 duty and shouldn't now be made into one.
QUESTION:

18

We have an Illinois Brick problem

19

before we even get to the substantive question, don't we?

20

I mean, why -- why should we entertain this -- this case

21

at all?
MR. TARANTO:

22

I don't think that Illinois Brick

23

-- in fact, I think Illinois Brick is not a jurisdictional

24

point.

25

certain kinds of damages.

It is a question of cause of action that goes to

QUESTION:

Well, I understand, but -- but those

2

-- those standing rules that are not jurisdictional are

3

still standing rules, and we normally apply them.

4

should we not apply our normal rule of standing in this

5

case?
MR. TARANTO:

6

Why

Well, we -- we do think you

7

should, but that it shouldn't preclude the Court from

8

reaching the merits, which are of much broader importance.

9

That is, in the absence of the rule being a jurisdictional

10

one, the Court has the option of considering either of two

11

grounds for reversing and reinstating the dismissal, just

12

as the Court did in the sovereign immunity case involving

13

Israel last year where there were two alternative grounds.

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. TARANTO:

16

Well, it seems to me -The merits question is a much

more --

17

QUESTION:

18

rush to the merits.

19

issues are very serious issues here.

20
21
22

It seems to me you're just trying to
I -- I think the standing and the

MR. TARANTO:

Oh, we -- we think so as -- as

well, and let me -- let me address that briefly.
QUESTION:

What you're -- what you're saying

23

basically it's a claim for relief issue rather than a --

24

than a jurisdictional issue.

25

MR. TARANTO:

Yes, yes.

The -- the statutory

26

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

standing question has always been treated as a question of

2

what the meaning of section 4 of the Clayton Act, the

3

damages provision, is here, and both the indirect

4

purchaser rule and the more general indirectness aspect of

5

Associated General Contractor has to do with who can get

6

what kinds of relief.

7

question, and therefore it remains open to this Court to

8

do what we think the Court should do, which is also to

9

address the question that is directly dividing the

10

That's not a jurisdictional

circuits, what is the scope of section 2.
QUESTION:

11

And --

Mr. Taranto, you made a -- an

12

interesting classification, and I think I tend to agree

13

with it, but I'm not sure that these Court's cases fit

14

that mold.
I had thought that the things that are put under

15
16

the head of, quote, prudential standing sound like does

17

this person have a claim under this statute for relief.

18

That's a 12(b)(6) question.

19

-- think that there's something in between constitutional

20

standing, which everyone agrees exists here, and 12(b)(6),

21

and that's this prudential standing notion.

But the Court seems to have

Is there a difference between the 12(b)(6)

22
23

inquiry, does this statute afford this plaintiff a claim

24

for relief, and what this Court has called prudential

25

standing?

1

MR. TARANTO:

The best that I can do with that

2

is to describe what the Court has done in the cases that

3

we rely on for saying there's no statutory standing.

4

Associated General Contractors and Illinois Brick and its

5

follow-on, Kansas against UtiliCorp, are all about the

6

interpretation of section 4 of the Clayton Act.

7

sense, they are classic 12(b)(6) questions.

8

analysis in Associated General Contractors is about what

9

the term injury to business or property means.

In that

The entire

They are

10

interpretive questions in that way.

11

prudential standing questions somewhere between

12

constitutional standing and statutory coverage.

13

that's why we think it is both proper and really quite

14

important for purposes of the several other circuit cases

15

that are now sitting in cert petitions in this Court on

16

the merits question that divides the circuits.

17

They're not separate

And

There is no section 2 duty on the merits now to

18

turn over your sales to a rival.

This Court said, as far

19

back as 1920 in the U.S. Steel case, section 2 does not

20

condemn mere size.

Section 2 does not compel competition.

21

The 1996 act does.

It has a quite different policy.

22

says we will mandate creation of competition.

23

says we protect against affirmative interferences in

24

independently arising competition.

25

different statutory approaches to a highly general goal of

QUESTION:

3
4

case?

Is this a kind of refusal to deal

So it could be covered in theory by section 2?
MR. TARANTO:

It is a kind of refusal to deal.

5

It is -- all of the claims in this case, all of the facts

6

allege inadequate help to rivals to come and displace

7

one's own sales.

8

section 2 protects the right to just make your sales and

9

not turn them over to rivals with a category of

This Court has broadly recognized that

10

exceptions.

11

deal cases, involves discrimination.

12

voluntarily in the business of selling the product that

13

the plaintiff wanted, and the plaintiff wanted it at the

14

terms that the firm was selling it to others, and the

15

defendant said, no.

16

Every one of those exceptions, the refusal to
The firm was

That threshold condition has so far been the

17

only sufficiently reliable one to trigger the inquiry, if

18

you're selling it to some -- to everybody else, why not to

19

the particular plaintiff?

20

selling to the plaintiff because the plaintiff is a rival

21

or the plaintiff is dealing with a rival, has been the one

exception to the general rule that forced sales to help

-- mean illegality.

25

far has been the necessary threshold condition for

And the answer, we're not

Discrimination doesn't mean that

There may be good reasons, but it so

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

demanding an inquiry.
This case does not involve any kind of

2
3

discrimination like that.

4

There couldn't be an allegation that Verizon was in the

5

business of renting out its facilities to rivals at

6

specially discounted prices before the 1996 act compelled

7

that.
So for Trinko to prevail here, it would have to

8
9

There's no allegation here.

-- the Court would have to recognize something brand new

10

under section 2.

It would have to expand section 2 to

11

where it has never been before, and we submit there are

12

extremely good reasons for not doing that.
QUESTION:

13

And the reason Otter Tail -- Otter

14

Tail seems like the strongest precedent against you.

15

Before you say the reasons against expansion, I'd just

16

like to hear 30 seconds on why in your opinion Otter Tail

17

is different than this.
MR. TARANTO:

18

Otter Tail was also a case of

19

discrimination.

If -- the opinion in Otter -- in Otter

20

Tail is a little bit shy on full explanation for what

21

factors matter, and so one has to look at what the facts

22

were.

23

the district judge, which are in the -- not the appendix

24

of this case but the appendix in Otter Tail, there's an

25

entire section called discrimination.

If you look at the extensive findings of fact by

Otter Tail at -- at

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

JA 103 to 111.
Otter Tail was undisputedly in the business of

2
3

wholesaling power and of wheeling power to others.

When

4

particular communities came and said we want from you the

5

same thing that you're happily selling to others, Otter

6

Tail said no.
That's exactly the same kind of discrimination

7
8

that existed in Aspen Skiing where the three mountain

9

defendants said, we won't even take full price ski tickets

10

from people who are using the fourth mountain because

11

that's a rival.

12

too.

13

So discrimination was the predicate there

This is not a case of discrimination.

In the

14

absence of discrimination, any court entertaining a

15

section 2 duty would have to undertake tasks that

16

antitrust has never viewed as appropriate.

17

to ask what are the effects on long-run investments, the

18

long-term effects on investments.

of whether we should recognize this plaintiff?

10

That is, Trinko

The additional considerations
There's obviously a better

AT&T.

QUESTION:

8
9

The injury here is indirect.

But AT&T didn't bring an antitrust

action.
MR. TARANTO:

Well, the -- the final -- final

11

reason I'll mention here is that recognizing the statutory

12

cause of action here would also interfere with the

13

voluntarily agreed upon nonjudicial dispute resolution

14

mechanism that AT&T and Verizon entered into.

15

QUESTION:

Mr. Taranto, Judge Katzmann in the

16

Second Circuit, whose decision we're reviewing, seemed to

17

think that AT&T was not, as you expressed it, the better

18

complainant, but that the remedy for AT&T was the

19

administrative context.

20

suggested that for AT&T the remedy was the administrative

21

route, but for the customer who has no place else to go,

22

it was court or nothing because the customer would not

23

have access to that administrative process.

24
25

I -- I thought his opinion

Now, is there -- first of all, is -- would AT&T
have standing or state a claim for relief if AT&T had been

the plaintiff here?
And second, if you're right that this plaintiff

2
3

has no claim in court, is there anyplace that this

4

plaintiff can go with the complaint?

and we accept what the complaint alleges as true for

Is there anyone in the world that that can be

asserted against?
MR. TARANTO:

11
12

The reality is --

Let me take those in -- in order,

if I may.

13

AT&T could, of course, have brought a Sherman

14

Act suit had it not expressly waived its right to go to

15

court.

16

relief far more promptly than any antitrust case would

17

have -- would have obtained.

18

It adopted instead a mechanism by which it secured

QUESTION:

So it's like --

But it had no choice in that.

19

mean, that's a statutory mechanism.

20

independent waiver that AT&T, as apart from others, what

21

they call them, CLEC's.

22

imposed on all the participants, isn't it?

Many agreements contain it.
This one does.

Some agreements do

And it serves very

And that's --

Okay, and if -- if there hadn't been

an agreement, AT&T would go where?
MR. TARANTO:

To the commission?

It -- it could go to the

commission or it could bring a Sherman Act suit unless, of

10

course, as we do contend, there is no legitimate section

11

-- section 2 claim.

12

the customer, that is, AT&T, has standing.

13

QUESTION:

But as far as standing is concerned,

Mr. Taranto, would you clarify one

14

thing for me?

15

York area problems or was it nationwide?

16

Did the AT&T settlement just settle the New

MR. TARANTO:

The New York Public Service

17

Commission settlement settled the New York problem.

18

was an FCC national level consent decree that on a going-

19

forward basis settled -- solved the problem.

20

was in fact a -- a New York-specific one, and here we're

21

talking about the only concrete instance in --

22

QUESTION:

There

The problem

Well, I was under the impression AT&T

23

retained the right to sue in other parts of the country.

24

In fact, they filed an amicus brief in this case, which

25

suggests that they still have an interest in the ongoing

26

12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

controversy, but not in New York.

2

MR. TARANTO:

I -- I'm -- I'm -- I don't know

3

that AT&T has signed similar agreements for the rest of

4

the country.

5

this problem was fully resolved in New York with

6

compensation to AT&T and nationally at the FCC level.

7

I -- I -- AT&T certainly, wherever it hasn't adopted an

8

arbitration agreement, the way any other plaintiff can

9

adopt, certainly has a right to go to court and to argue

This particular problem that gave rise to

So

10

as -- as Covad has in the Eleventh Circuit case, as

11

Cavalier has in the Fourth Circuit case, to argue that

12

there is a Sherman Act claim, and that's the merits claim

13

that is before this Court as part of this case as well.
QUESTION:

14

Of course, their position is that

15

this isn't the best test case because this plaintiff

16

didn't make all the right allegations, as I read their

17

brief.

18

MR. TARANTO:

Well, I -- I don't think there

19

could have been any different allegations on the

20

dispositive point.

21

incumbent insufficiently helped the rival --

22

QUESTION:

As long as the allegations are the

Yes, but they -- they alleged that in

23

other areas, that there had been -- that there's been sham

24

litigation, fraudulent misrepresentations, and -- and

25

affirmative misconduct, in addition to failing to comply

2

with all the requirements of the '96 statute.
MR. TARANTO:

And -- and those -- those claims,

3

to the extent that they're not helping hand kinds of

4

claims, would of course be outside the analysis.

5

Cavalier case, the Covad case are overwhelmingly, as this

6

case is, helping hand cases, as the Goldwasser case in the

7

Seventh Circuit was, and that's the core issue that --

8

that all of these cases are about.

9

The

Now --

10

QUESTION:

Would you get to the --

11

MR. TARANTO:

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

-- the last part?

Does this customer

13

of AT&T have any remedy for the bad service that the

14

customer attributes not to AT&T but to Verizon?

15

MR. TARANTO:

Yes.

Well, first, in this very

16

case the Second Circuit reinstated the section 202 claim

17

of this plaintiff and this Court denied cert on that.

18

that claim is alive in this very case.

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. TARANTO:

So

Are damages available on that claim?
The claim is -- is a claim under

21

the damages provision of section 207 for an alleged

22

violation of the substantive Communications Act provision

23

in section 202.

24

They, of course, also have any remedies any

25

customer has for lousy service here against AT&T, the

26

14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

provider of the service, which received compensation.
QUESTION:

2

But you -- you say that under --

3

under 202 that there would be if -- if plaintiff prevails

4

on that claim against Verizon, not AT&T, there would be a

5

damage remedy for the loss that the plaintiff could prove?

6

In other words, does it give the plaintiff the same thing

7

that the plaintiff is seeking here except it's not

8

trebled?

9

MR. TARANTO:

The plaintiff certainly asks for

10

the same damages.

11

liability damages provision of the Communications Act.

12

The Second Circuit said that that provision was available

13

to this plaintiff to seek recovery for injury from the

14

alleged violation of section 202.

15

Section 202 -- section 207 is the

QUESTION:

Then why did Judge Katzmann say a

16

couple of times the only opportunity for the plaintiff to

17

get damages is if there is this second section 2 suit?

18

MR. TARANTO:

I'm -- I'm afraid I can't answer

19

that question, having -- the court having reinstated that

20

-- that claim.

21
22

That is a damages claim.

If the Court has no further questions, I would
reserve the balance of my time.

13

MR. OLSON:

We did not brief and we did not take

we believe that in order to ascertain antitrust standing,

MR. OLSON:

We -- we felt, Justice Scalia, not

of prudential standing in the context of antitrust

we felt that the Court would have to first answer the

18

question whether there is an antitrust injury itself.

19

there any violation of the antitrust laws that would give

20

rise to a section 2, Sherman Act claim in this case.

QUESTION:

But you're asking us to do that in a

22

case where a -- a plaintiff without a real interest may be

23

the one that's -- that's demanding that -- that

24

adjudication.

25

This is very odd.

MR. OLSON:

Well, we do think -- we do think --

1

and had we briefed the question, we would have -- we would

2

have thought that there was -- that -- that Trinko had

3

some points here, that it -- this is not an Illinois Brick

4

case -- that Trinko was depending in part upon service

5

provided by the Verizon loop and that it had a choice, as

6

the plaintiffs -- the plaintiff -- that Trinko has alleged

7

in this case, that it had a choice between deficient

8

service from AT&T or -- or paying perhaps a higher price

9

or something else from Verizon, that there are

10
11

distinctions.
And we think that they might -- but because we

12

didn't brief that, because we thought it was -- the Court

13

first -- we have a litigant here that alleges, and we have

14

a Second Circuit decision, and we've got other circuit

15

decisions that have addressed this very antitrust issue --

16

that it's very important to resolve that case,

17

particularly in the context of where we have an -- a

18

significant, extraordinary effort by Congress to create a

19

comprehensive, complex, carefully modulated effort to

20

create something.

21

QUESTION:

And do you -- do you take the

22

position that that effort gives Trinko a cause of action

23

under the statute?

MR. OLSON:

MR. OLSON:

Yes.
There is a -- there would be -- and

the Second Circuit did decide that there was a right to

action under the discrimination provisions of section 202.

And this appears -- it's the -- the first full --

9

QUESTION:

Is --

10

QUESTION:

But I -- I thought Mr. Taranto said

11

this -- there is no discrimination in this case.

12

if that's true, then there wouldn't be a remedy under 207.
MR. OLSON:

13

So that

Well, first of all, to the extent

14

that there is and to the extent that there are allegations

15

of that, the court addressed that and reinstated that very

16

cause of action.

17

That --

18

This Court decided not to review that.

QUESTION:

Okay, but on the -- just on the facts

19

pleaded, do you take -- does the United States take the

20

position that -- that Trinko has pleaded a cause of action

21

under 202 or any other section of the statute?

22

MR. OLSON:

We do not dispute, Justice Souter,

the existence of the cause of action recognized by the

competitive?
MR. OLSON:

2

Actually we submit, Justice Kennedy,

3

that what the Communications Act does is something that

4

the antitrust laws never did do.

5

Communications Act was in -- in fact necessary to break up

6

the monopolies, to cause legitimate, lawful monopolies to

7

do something that the antitrust laws wouldn't require,

8

that is, to open up their markets, which they had no

9

obligation under the antitrust laws to do, at a subsidized

And the reason that the

10

rate to invite in competition -- that entire regulatory

11

scheme was something that Congress decided was necessary

12

to do which no other laws in existence had been able to

13

do.

14

Therefore, not only -- and I think that this is

15

clear from the Court's jurisprudence as well, but also

16

well articulated in the Town of Concord decision that was

17

authored by Justice Breyer on the First Circuit.

18

regulatory regime, which monitors the conduct on an

19

ongoing basis, which the antitrust laws are not well

20

equipped to do, prevents the occurrence of antitrust

21

injury and inhibits the ability to accomplish antitrust

22

benefits and monitors the process in a way that succeeds

23

in dealing with the possibility of anti-competitive

24

conduct, but conduct that was not required at all under

25

the antitrust laws, that on opening of the markets to

That

1

selling one's assets at a discount, to going into a

2

business that the lawful monopolist was not already in.

3

The additional point there is that the treble

4

damage remedy is considerably more draconian.

It acts in

5

an ad hoc, specific case under the supervision of

6

generalize -- generalist judges and ad hoc juries.

7

Whereas Congress decided that the scheme was most -- that

8

was most appropriate -- the regime that was most

9

appropriate to create this new world that this Court

10

specifically recognized in the two previous

11

Telecommunications Act cases was this regulatory regime,

12

inhabited by experts, administered by experts, where there

13

are prompt, efficient, effective remedies, and -- and a

14

scheme which is adjustable from time to time to deal with

15

any anti-competitive conduct.

16

So it's not only a reason why Congress said we

17

do not change the antitrust laws by this statute.

18

good reasons why Congress decided to do that.

19

also additional reasons why the section 2 remedy would be

20

a sledge hammer in an area where Congress has enacted a

21

scalpel to deal --

MR. OLSON:

I agree with that, Justice Scalia -You do.

-- we addressed those principles because we felt we had an

9

obligation.

And we have addressed -- the Government has

10

articulated those same principles not only in this

Court -QUESTION:

12

How can you say the Communications

13

Act has superseded the Sherman Act when the statute itself

14

says it didn't?
MR. OLSON:

15

It does -- no, we are not suggesting

16

-- we're not saying that the -- that the act provides any

17

immunity.

18

say is that this was not -- this conduct was not a Sherman

says --

unwarranted to adopt the discrimination test that my

the antitrust laws in that act should be enforced in

Now --

QUESTION:

And at some point in -- in your

MR. VERRILLI:

event, because Trinko has -- has an is a proper plaintiff

19

under section 4 of the Clayton Act, is entitled to invoke

20

the Sherman Act, the fact that they had -- it has other

21

remedies seems to me beside -- beside the crucial point.

22

Now, under Reiter against Sonotone, this Court

23

held that consumers have standing under section 4 of the

24

Sherman Act -- under section 4 of the Clayton Act to sue

25

when they are injured by anti-competitive conduct that

There would be

raises prices or lowers quality in the market where they

2

purchase.

That is what Mr. Trinko is alleging.
Illinois Brick is not a reason to cut off that

3
4

standing here, as General Olson indicated, for the

5

following reason.

6

Shoe applies, and Hanover Shoe does not apply here.

7

Illinois Brick is just the flip side of Hanover Shoe.
Hanover Shoe says that in a case of a price-

8
9

Illinois Brick applies when Hanover

fixing overcharge -- the same as in UtiliCorp -- price-

10

fixing overcharge -- when a middle man pays too much, the

11

middle man is entitled to sue under the Sherman Act for

12

the entire amount of the price-fixing overcharge, and the

13

-- and the defendant can't assert a pass-through defense.

14

And -- and the reason for that is to ensure full and

15

effective use and enforcement of the Sherman Act's damages

16

remedy.

17

Now, in that situation, what Illinois Brick

18

holds is that, well, once the -- once the middle man has

19

sued for the full value of the overcharge, then the people

20

subsequently down the chain can't bring antitrust claims

21

themselves because that would create a problem of

22

duplicative recovery.

in 1927 that AT&T's measure of damages would be its lost

QUESTION:

10

But that -- it only

And here, of course, AT&T is a
AT&T would bring a monopolization

And --

So as long as the consumer can bring

11

an action for something that AT&T couldn't bring, no

12

Illinois -- no Hanover, no Illinois Brick.
MR. VERRILLI:

13

Correct.

In fact, it would

14

disserve the very policies of Hanover Shoe here because it

15

would result in the -- the monopolist not being

16

responsible for the full value of the antitrust injury it

17

inflicts.

18

So there's no Illinois Brick problem here.
And I think that's why my friends on the other

19

side in Verizon relied so much on Associated General

20

Counsel -- Associated General Contractors rather than

21

Illinois Brick.

22

-- as this Court made clear in Holmes, is a rule of

23

proximate cause.

24
25

But, of course, all that case states, as

And remember the facts in Associated General
Contractors.

The allegation was that a landowner

pressured a contractor to hire non-union subcontractors,

2

and as a result the union subcontractors had less

3

business, and as a result, they had fewer employees, and

4

as a result, the union had fewer dues to collect.

5

Court quite properly held that proximate causation can't

possibly extend that far.

You -- you represent a

there are many, many members of the class who have

different kinds of injuries from the other members of the

class?

13

how the wrongdoing that affected AT&T necessarily carries

14

over to customers of AT&T.

15

It's a little hard for me to understand precisely

MR. VERRILLI:

The means by which Verizon was

16

trying to monopolize the market, as the complaint alleges

17

-- and I think this is clear from paragraphs 1 and 2 and

18

54 of the amended complaint -- was that it was -- Verizon

19

was using its control of the local loop that competitors

20

needed to lease to get service going to degrade the

21

service that its competitors, including AT&T, were able to

22

provide to customers.

23

the antitrust scheme was effectuated, and as a result --

24
25

QUESTION:

That was the means by which the --

Because that's a little different

from the way the court of appeals described the complaint.
MR. VERRILLI:

Well, I -- I understand it, Your

8

Honor, but the -- but the complaint -- one of the

9

difficulties of this case, of course, is that we're here

10

on a complaint and the test under rule 8 is a notice

11

pleading test, and it can -- and the complaint can only be

12

dismissed if there is no conceivable set of facts that

13

could be proved consistent with the allegations in the

14

complaint that would support relief.

15

QUESTION:

And --

Yes, but you have to have alleged in

16

your complaint just how it was that -- that Verizon's

17

misconduct hurt your clients.

18

MR. VERRILLI:

Yes, Your Honor, and I think the

19

-- I think paragraph 2 of the amended complaint says that

20

Bell Atlantic deterred and will continue to deter

21

potential customers from switching to another company for

22

local phone service or cause customers that switch back to

Bell Atlantic in frustration for the poor services

4

QUESTION:

Under the -- what bothers me about

5

the Illinois Brick problem is -- I completely agree with

your characterization, but the law would seem odd that

7

would say when Smith, a price-fixing ring, charges Jones

8

$3 extra, we don't let Jones' customers sue for the actual

9

overcharge he undoubtedly suffered.

But in fact, when

10

Smith, the monopolist, drives Jones through predatory

11

pricing out of the market, we let Jones' customers come in

12

and say, oh, my service isn't as good, I -- I may -- I

15

that is, how much more uncertain it is, how much more

13

Customer, we're going to wreck your service unless you buy

from us, or indeed carried that out in -- through

surreptitious ways, but that's what he was saying.

don't see that in the complaint.

QUESTION:

You

If that's what the
But I

Well, under --

Rather, what I see in the complaint

21

-- and I want you to point out where it's the contrary --

22

is that every claim of bad service is connected through a

24

Verizon to hook up AT&T, i.e., to provide them with the

25

Verizon service so they can provide service to the

QUESTION:

8

MR. VERRILLI:

9

First, paragraph 2, which is at

2 is the overview.
Yes, but what it says, Justice

Breyer, is that they degraded service.

Well, the -- the

10

degraded service has to occur not only during the -- the

11

process of switching over, but after the switching over,

12

and of course, under Swierkiewicz and under Leatherman,

13

the test here is whether there's any set of facts that

14

could be proved consistent with these notice pleading

15

allegations that would support a cause of action.

16

think Your Honor's question proves that there is, the

17

first set of facts that Your Honor described.

18

QUESTION:

And I

So --

Well, I'm not with you completely for

19

the reason that the overview seems to be an overview which

20

is explicated by the specific complaints of exclusionary

21

conduct which appear later in the complaint.

22
23

MR. VERRILLI:

But I think those complaints are

fairly construed to -- to include denial --

24

QUESTION:

And I would like you to point out.

MR. VERRILLI:

I think it's true about paragraph

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

52.

I think it's true about paragraph 54.

2

that is the essence of the complaint here.

3

that makes sense because these are exactly the kinds of

4

allegations -- this is -- this is the way monopolization

5

occurs.

6

in this -- in this arena.

history that goes back to MCI against AT&T and

QUESTION:

9

I think that

There's a long and unfortunate

All right.

10

MR. VERRILLI:

11

QUESTION:

-- to this present day.

Then with paragraph 54, which I

12

thought was the heart of the complaint, what it seems to

13

say at the end is when they did these bad things, the

14

Mr. Verrilli?
MR. VERRILLI:

I'm sorry, Mr. Chief Justice.

12

It's at page 46 of the joint appendix, paragraph 54 of the

13

amended complaint.

14

What it alleges is that AT&T and other

15

competitors weren't able to provide service at the -- at

16

the level of quality -- provide service at the level of

17

quality that -- that Verizon could.

18

that they weren't able to provide service at all.

19

both of those things.

20

there in 54, and I think the -- and it's described in the

21

22

23

It doesn't only say
It says

And so I think the allegation is

And paragraphs 1 and 2 of the

And I'd like to -- if I could, go to -- to the

24

core antitrust issue here.

I think it is common ground

25

with my friends on the other side that a monopolist's

1

right to refuse to deal with competitors is not an

2

unqualified right.

3

That's where the monopolist discriminates.

4

that's the only time a section 2 duty ought to be imposed

5

because that -- in that situation you can be confident

6

that it's anti-competitive conduct, and you won't have

7

problems with dampening incentives and you won't have

8

administrability problems because you can refer back to

9

the prior course of dealing.

They acknowledge one qualification.
They argue

But where they're wrong is in suggesting that

10
11

that's the only time that you can find liability under

12

section 2 for monopolist refusal to cooperate with its

13

rivals.

14

situation where, as Justice Kennedy, your question earlier

15

indicated, there is a regulatory regime in place that

16

requires competitive access on the part of the monopolist

17

in order to bring competition into the market.

18

you have -- and -- and I think these allegations are

19

consistent that -- what I am about to say is consistent

20

with the allegations in the complaint, and what you have

21

is a course of conduct on the part of the monopolist that

22

is intended to subvert the competitive entry that those

23

regulations require.

24
25

It is equally true in this case, in this

QUESTION:

And what

Well, you -- you say then that the

1996 act gives you affirmative momentum that you wouldn't

2

antitrust laws?

3

MR. VERRILLI:

I wouldn't put it quite that way,

4

Your Honor, but I -- and I will answer Your -- Your

5

Honor's question directly.

6

Sherman Act, for exclusionary conduct applies in the same

7

way that -- it's the exact same test whether the '96 act

8

is there or not.

9

rivals' opportunities to compete in the market and whether

The -- the test, under the

The test is whether the conduct impairs

10

the -- the conduct does or does not further -- by the

11

monopolist further competition on the merits.

12

That test would apply to a different factual

13

scenario after the 1996 act was passed than before.

14

it's clear that that must be the case.

15

And

For example, Your Honor, one thing that the 1996

16

act did -- this is section 253 of the act, which I think

17

is at page 90 of the appendix to the petition -- it

18

eliminated, preempted State monopoly franchises.

19

prior to passage of the 1996 act, if -- if Trinko went to

20

sue -- bring a section 2 claim against a local telephone

21

provider in a State where -- where there was a monopoly

22

franchise law, Trinko would be out of court on the State

23

action doctrine.

24

Well, section 253 of the act preempted the defense.

25

Now,

There would be an ironclad defense.

So obviously in that situation, there is an

26

36
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

antitrust claim that wasn't there before, and so it can't

2

be the case that what -- that -- that the passage of the

3

1996 act has no relevance whatsoever to the application of

4

section 2 of the Sherman Act.

5

would impermissibly -- it would violate the savings clause

6

and impermissibly modify the applicability of the

7

antitrust laws to conclude that the 1996 act is the sole

8

remedy here for a person in Trinko's position.
QUESTION:

9

And indeed, we think it

Well, you're modifying it either way,

10

aren't you?

I mean, you're modifying it if you say sole

11

remedy.

12

Chief Justice's words, momentum.

You're modifying it if -- if it gives, in the

MR. VERRILLI:

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. VERRILLI:

I don't think so.

It's modification either way.
I don't think so, Justice Souter,

16

because the -- the statute says that nothing shall modify

17

the -- modify, impair, or supersede the applicability of

18

the antitrust laws.

19

QUESTION:

And the momentum theory, in effect,

20

says the applicability is being modified because there's a

21

declaration of certain anti-competitive conduct.
MR. VERRILLI:

22

Well, I don't -- I don't think

23

so.

I think it -- the exact same test applies before the

24

act was enacted and after, so it doesn't -- it doesn't

25

modify the substantive antitrust rule one iota.

act for the characterization of those facts as anti-

6

MR. VERRILLI:

Well, yes, in the following

7

sense, Justice Souter.

But I don't think it constitutes a

8

modification of the applicability of the antitrust laws.

9

It might change the result under the antitrust laws, but

10

not modify the applicability because the general rule

11

under the antitrust laws is that one takes the regulatory

12

context into account, and the fact that conduct violates

13

extrinsic norms, and in particular, when it violates, as

14

it did in MCI v. AT&T and in the Litton Systems case and

15

the court -- cases in the court of appeals, when it

16

violates extrinsic norms that are designed to promote

17

competition, that counts against the --

QUESTION:

Telecommunications Act imposes new duties and the

MR. VERRILLI:

2

QUESTION:

They -- I --

But it seemed to me the thrust of

3

Justice Souter's question as well was that the

4

Telecommunications Act imposes new duties, and violation

5

of those new duties is -- is really the gravamen of your

6

complaint.

7

MR. VERRILLI:

I don't think that -- I don't

8

think that's quite right, Justice Kennedy, and let me try

9

to explain why.

10

The test is whether the monopolist's conduct

11

prevents competition, obstructs competition, whether it

12

does so on a basis other than competition on the merits,

13

and whether it is -- there's otherwise a legitimate

14

business justification.

15

United States acknowledges at page 14 of its complaint.

16

That's the rule that was applied in Aspen, the rule that

17

was applied in Kodak.

18

That's the general rule, as the

That's the rule.

That rule applies here.

When one answers the

19

first part of that test that -- which is does the

20

monopolist's conduct obstruct competition, the -- the --

21

it's not the case that any violation of the 1996 act would

22

obstruct competition.

23

the monopolist's conduct is sufficiently grave,

24

sufficiently serious, sufficiently sustained that it --

25

that it amounts to an overall pattern that obstructs

What has to be shown there is that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

competition.

2

-- that there's a -- an automatic transference of a -- of

3

a duty under the 1996 act into an antitrust duty.

4

So it's not the case that there is a -- that

But where the -- where the 1996 act becomes

5

relevant is when you get to the next stage of the inquiry.

6

And I think -- and it's just what Your Honor said earlier.

7

At that stage in the inquiry, it is -- the monopolist does

8

not have open to it the argument that this is pro-

9

competitive behavior and that I have a legitimate business

10

justification for it because in that circumstance, it is

11

unlawful to do it.

12

business justification to say I don't want to do something

13

that the law compels me to do because I'll be better off

14

as a competitive matter if I don't do it.

15

enter the analysis.

16

But it doesn't transform or change in any way the

17

antitrust standard.

20

So it does

It's not irrelevant by any means.

But it -- it does have this -- this additional

19

And so it can't be a legitimate

effect -QUESTION:

Or does it say we define pro-

21

competitive in a -- in a new way based on the

pro-competitive.

MR. VERRILLI:

The Telecommunications Act is

can no longer say that it is -- that it is consistent with

competition on the merits for a monopolist to refuse to

cooperate when a law designed to promote competition

insists on the cooperation.

MR. VERRILLI:

I -- I disagree with that, Your

4

Honor, and the reason why is this.

5

question -- if I may say so, I think it picks up on what I

6

believe to be a false choice that my friends on the other

7

side are presenting, and that's a choice between, on the

8

one hand, a -- a duty to deal relegated solely to the

9

circumstance of discrimination and, on the other hand, a

Because I think that

10

wholly unqualified duty to deal that -- that might raise a

11

lot of the problems that Your Honor has identified.

12

But there's a middle ground here, and it's the

13

middle ground that I -- that I submit to Your Honor that

that makes a world of sense.

it's always going to be argued, no, you're in compliance;

14

yes, I am in compliance.

MR. VERRILLI:

I -- I think the answer is

16

if it can't be resolved on summary judgment -- of course,

17

Matsushita says that summary judgment has a particularly

15

Judge Wood said one of the problems with reading the

Telecommunications Act effectively into section 2 is that

it then -- then section 2 of the Sherman Act might eclipse

16

that the Federal Communications Commission is not on the

21

the -- the access duties and specific obligations, ought

22

to be enforced under the antitrust laws as well as under

that.
The fact is that the regulatory regime that the

2
3

FCC tried to put in place to bring long distance

4

competition and to bring telephone equipment competition

5

was insufficient, standing on its own with all of those

6

regulatory mechanisms, to make that competition occur.

7

That competition occurred only when vigorous antitrust

8

enforcement was brought to bear in part to enforce those

9

very regulatory requirements.
And that makes a great deal of common sense, of

10
11

course, because the incumbents in this situation have

12

every incentive in the world for this system not to work

13

because they want to retain as many customers as they can

14

and they want to make as much money as they can, and they

15

have ample ability to do it.

16

which they could subvert this -- this regulatory regime by

17

-- with -- with using low-level, low-intensity

18

obstructionist conduct that history has shown is beyond

the power of the regulators to -- to capture and prevent.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

MR. TARANTO:

Thank you, Your Honor.

10

The words competition, obstruction of

11

competition, pro-competitive mask a fundamental

12

distinction between the 1996 act and the Sherman Act.

13

'96 act creates competition.

14

has always gone no further than protecting independently-

15

developed competition.

16

regime for policing the thousand ways, as Mr. Verrilli

17

said, in which the obligations to create competition might

18

be violated.

19

The

Section 2 of the Sherman Act

The '96 act is a comprehensive

This complaint, if you look at the two

20

paragraphs that Mr. Verrilli cited, paragraph 2 and

21

paragraph 54, are all -- is all about helping to create

22

competition.

23

is that Verizon was making it difficult to obtain full use

24

of Verizon's local loops.

25

obstruction of AT&T's independent efforts to create

Paragraph 2 says the conduct we complain of

There is no allegation of

seller/buyer transactions on its own without help.
What we ask the Court to say on the merits here

3

is not that there is a rigid requirement of discrimination

4

or anything else.

5

that up till now -- till now -- helping hand cases have

6

been limited by the requirement of discrimination between

7

customers, not between self and others, but between

8

customers, and there are compellingly strong reasons not

9

to expand section 2 beyond that.

What we ask the Court to recognize is

For institutional

10

reasons, the antitrust courts are not capable of reliably

11

making the necessary determinations and for fundamental

12

incentive reasons, the incentives of incumbents to invest,

13

the incentives of rivals to invest rather than piggy-back.

14

In this context, a common law-like context,

15

there's no question of overriding preexisting, settled

16

antitrust obligations.

The question is should the Court

17

create something new.

And in a common law-like area, the

18

existence of another regime is one strong reason not to

19

create something new.

20

Decker case only last term involving the common law of

21

ERISA obligations when the Court said the scope of

22

permissible judicial innovation is narrower where other

23

Federal actors are engaged.

24

to decide, that the 1996 act is one compellingly good

25

reason not to create new section 2 law here.

The Court said so in the Black &

That's what we ask the Court
