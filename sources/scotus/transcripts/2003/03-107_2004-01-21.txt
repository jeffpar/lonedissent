ORAL ARGUMENT OF EDWIN S. KNEEDLER

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

We'll hear argument

MR. KNEEDLER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

14 years ago in the Duro decision this Court

11

held that under the state of Indian law, as it then stood,

12

and Indian tribe could not prosecute an Indian who was not

13

a member of that tribe.

14

that its decision might create a jurisdictional gap on

15

many reservations, but the Court concluded that if the

16

present jurisdictional regime proves insufficient to meet

17

the needs of reservation law enforcement, the proper body

18

to address that concern is Congress, which has plenary

19

power over Indian affairs.

20

The Court recognized, though,

Congress responded immediately to this Court's

21

decision.

It -- it conducted an extensive inquiry and

22

heard hearings about the consequences of the Court's

23

decision and heard strong expressions of concern by many

24

Indian tribes, by the Federal Government, and by numerous

25

States about the law enforcement vacuum that would be
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

created over many misdemeanor offenses on Indian

2

reservations.

3

Congress to restore the power to Indian tribes to exercise

4

their sovereign power to prosecute non-member Indians.

5

And there was widespread support for

QUESTION:

Why didn't -- why didn't they extend

6

it to non-Indians?

7

non-member Indian commits an offense on an Indian

8

reservation, why isn't it an equivalent problem when a --

9

a white man commits the same crime on an Indian

10

I mean, if it's a problem when a -- a

reservation?

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think the answer lies in -- in

12

the longstanding jurisdictional regime on Indian

13

reservations.

14

crimes statute has authorized prosecutions by the Federal

15

Government over crimes committed by non-Indians, including

16

misdemeanor crimes, and so there was not a jurisdictional

17

void.

18

difficulty came from the fact that that statute, again

19

since the earliest times, had -- has exempted crimes

20

committed by one Indian against the person or property of

21

another.

Going back to 1817, the general Indian

The difficulty came -- the -- the most acute

22

QUESTION:

Well, why couldn't they have changed

23

that?

They could have solved the problem by simply

24

treating non-member Indians the same way they treat non-

25

Indians.

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Congress could have done so, but

2

Congress, with the plenary power over Indian affairs,

3

chose -- decided that the proper course or the most

4

appropriate course was to have that jurisdiction exercised

5

by the Indian tribes.

6

considerable evidence that that power had long, in fact,

7

been exercised by Indian tribes over other Indians who

8

were not members of the particular tribe.

And Congress heard considerable --

QUESTION:

What's --

10

QUESTION:

There's some ambiguity about what

11

Indian refers to.

12

enrolled in an Indian tribe or can it be anyone who is the

13

child of Indian parents?

14

Is it -- must it be someone who is

MR. KNEEDLER:

It -- generally, it has been

15

understood to require a tribal affiliation.

16

the definition under -- under the Indian Civil Rights Act

17

for tribal power, Congress adopted the same meaning of

18

Indian that is applied under the Federal criminal statutes

19

for the purpose of having the two mesh completely.

20
21
22

QUESTION:

Yes, but what is that?

First of all,

What is that

definition?
MR. KNEEDLER:

And under that, obviously,

23

someone who is an enrolled -- formally enrolled member

24

would be an Indian, but as this Court pointed out in

25

footnote 7 of its Antelope decision, the -- that provision
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has not been construed to require that strictly, that

2

ordinarily someone who is an Indian and has a tribal

3

affiliation and is recognized by the tribe is also

4

regarded as an Indian.

5

In this case, though, we have a situation where

6

someone who is an enrolled member of another tribe.

7

questions about the -- about the -- how the statute should

8

be construed or applied in situations where there's not

9

one -- someone who's formally a member are -- are not

10

So

present in this case.

11

QUESTION:

Mr. Kneedler, is it the case that the

12

Bill of Rights is -- has not been thought applicable to

13

criminal defendants who are members of the tribe in a

14

tribal court or to non-tribal Indian -- non-tribal member

15

Indians?

16
17

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

Under this Court's

decision, this --

18

QUESTION:

In -- in tribal court.

19

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

This Court's decision in

20

Talton v. Mayes said that the Fifth Amendment did not

21

apply to the exercise of powers by Indian tribes, and

22

that's been understood to apply to --

23

QUESTION:

Would that be perhaps one reason why

24

Congress didn't go ahead and subject non-Indians to tribal

25

prosecution?

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it -- it may be, but -- but

2

it's important to recognize what -- what Congress has also

3

done here was to enact the Indian Civil Rights Act which

4

extends to Indian tribes many of the requirements of the

5

Bill of Rights.

6

QUESTION:

But not all.

7

MR. KNEEDLER:

Not all of them, but Congress in

8

1968 examined the question of the -- of the rights of --

9

of Indians and others subject to tribal jurisdiction and

10

-- and applied the -- the provisions of the -- of the

11

Indian Civil Rights Act.

12
13

QUESTION:

So there -- the -- the --

Should we consider in this case the

due process and equal protection arguments that are --

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

I don't -- I don't believe they

15

are before the Court.

16

those questions go to what restraints are on the tribe

17

itself when it's exercising its own power.

18

the basis of the court of appeals decision in this case.

19

The court of appeals decision was really on the separate

20

ground of what happens when you have, first, the tribe

21

exercising its sovereign power and then the United States

22

exercising power after that under the Double Jeopardy

23

Clause.

24
25

QUESTION:

What was before the -- those --

That was not

Well, I suppose under one view of the

case -- and it's -- it's not your view -- if this were

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

deemed to be a delegated power, then the absence or the --

2

the presence of obligations under the Bill of Rights would

3

become very important.

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- it depends what one

5

means by delegation.

The word delegation is -- is used in

6

a variety of ways.

7

common to speak of Congress delegating power to an

8

executive agency to carry out a certain function, but when

9

the executive agency does this, it's not exercising

I mean, for -- for example, it's

10

congressional power.

It's exercising power that Congress

11

in its plenary authority has -- has conferred on the

12

executive branch to --

13

QUESTION:

But -- but it --

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

15

QUESTION:

-- to then execute those laws.

But it is exercising the power of the

16

United States as distinct from the power of some other

17

sovereign.

18

the -- as I understand it, is -- is whether the tribe is

19

exercising its own power or the power of the United

20

States.

21

And -- and the issue in this case is whether

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right.

I -- I was using that by

22

analogy to say that the word delegate is -- is often used,

23

including in this Court's opinions I think, in a -- in a

24

somewhat looser sense in terms of -- of authorizing

25

someone else to act.

But I think -- I think -8

QUESTION:

Well, if it's authorized --

2

exercising its own power, how then can Congress make the

3

Bill of Rights applicable.

4

exercise of sovereignty?

5

MR. KNEEDLER:

As -- as a condition to the
Is that the way it works?

Yes.

And that's -- I think

6

that's exactly what Congress did in the Indian Civil

7

Rights Act.

8

said in Wheeler and has said in numerous other decisions

9

that Congress has plenary power over the exercise of a

It -- it require -- and -- and this Court

10

tribe's own sovereign powers.

11

the Indian Civil Rights Act was precisely to regulate

12

that.

13

QUESTION:

And what Congress did in

Mr. Kneedler, may I raise the -- the

14

point that is -- is the greatest trouble for me so -- so

15

you perhaps could address that?

16

what Justice Kennedy has raised.

17

Because it follows from

As I understand what we held -- forget our

18

language about delegation for a minute.

As I understand

19

what we held in Oliphant, which we followed in Duro, was

20

that the very concept of -- of this dependent or

21

subordinate sovereignty that tribes are -- are understood

22

to have, the way we look at Indian issues, is inconsistent

23

with the exercise of tribal jurisdiction over a -- a non-

24

member.

25

dependent sovereignty is constitutional or common law

Whether that notion of subordinate or -- or

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

doesn't really matter.

2

that concept, that concept is inconsistent with the

3

exercise of the tribe's own sovereign jurisdiction over a

4

-- a non-tribal member.

5

As long as we're going to have

If we are going to stick with that concept then,

6

it seems to me that we have got to understand the statute

7

in question here as a statute that confers Federal power

8

on the tribe as distinct from one that restores the

9

tribe's sovereign power because the tribe can't have the

10

sovereign power as long as we are going to understand that

11

tribe to have this subordinate sovereignty.

12

therefore, for me the concepts that we're using pretty

13

much force the conclusion that the -- that the power

14

that's being exercised is Federal not Indian.

And

15

Could you comment on -- on that analysis?

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

17

Yes.

I -- I think there -- there

are several responses to that point.

18

First of all, I think it matters a lot whether

19

one views the limitations on tribal power as mandated by

20

the Constitution or as a product of Federal common law.

21

And in -- and --

22

QUESTION:

Well, it may have a great deal to do

23

with whether we can change our conceptualization about

24

dependent sovereignty, but as long as we keep that

25

conceptualization, it seems to me we've got to accept the
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

conclusion that -- that I suggested.

2

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I -- I -- with respect, I

3

don't think that's correct because I think if it -- if it

4

is not -- if this conception is not constitutionally

5

mandated, then Congress has the authority, the plenary

6

authority, over Indian affairs to regulate, to modify

7

tribal jurisdiction.

8

that --

9

QUESTION:

And -- and in fact, I think that --

Okay, but if it does so, we have to

10

accept the -- if we're going to follow that route, we will

11

have to accept the conclusion that the whole concept of

12

dependent sovereignty has -- has been modified in -- in

13

some way because you can't have it both ways.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I -- I believe that's --

15

that's an expression of the dependency or a manifestation

16

of the dependency, not in derogation of it, because

17

dependent means that your ability to exercise authority --

18

in this case, the Indian tribe is always subject to the

19

overriding powers of the Federal Government.

20

this Court said precisely in the --

21

QUESTION:

And what

Well, if that -- if that were all we

22

meant in Oliphant, we would have said the -- the Federal

23

Government could take away this power by statute.

24

didn't say the Federal Government could take away the

25

power by statute.

We

We said it is gone by virtue of the -11

the sovereignty relationship.
MR. KNEEDLER:

But it -- if -- if one looks back

3

at the Oliphant decision, what the Court there described

4

its -- its undertaking was was essentially a -- a -- an

5

articulation of what it called Indian law which is a -- a

6

combination of judge-made law but against the backdrop of

7

treaties and statutes.

8

not themselves embodying constitutionally mandated rules.

9

They are the product of the political branches.

Those treaties and statutes are

They

10

sometimes don't answer precise questions, and this Court

11

is required to articulate judicial principles as best it

12

can against the backdrop of those principles.

13

those principles themselves are traced to treaties and

14

statutes, it must be up to -- Congress must have the

15

authority to modify those rules, and that's consistent

16

with its plenary power over Indian affairs.

17

But because

What this Court said in the Montana decision,

18

which -- which has been identified as the path-marking

19

decision over -- concerning jurisdiction over non-tribal

20

members, was what tribes lost by virtue of their dependent

21

status was the power independently to determine their

22

external relations.

This is not what we have here --

1

MR. KNEEDLER:

2

QUESTION:

3

No.

No, it isn't --

-- when we talk about sovereign

power?

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

This is not a unilateral

5

assertion of tribal power.

This Court held in -- in

6

Oliphant and Duro, by looking at the -- at the backdrop of

7

-- of statutory enactments, that its power had been

8

limited, but -- and the tribe did not unilaterally

9

overcome that.

What Congress did was lift the limits so

10

that the tribe -- the tribe would then be authorized to

11

exercise sovereign power that it previously had -- had

12

had.

13

And it's in that -- it's directly analogous to

14

two important examples that I think are very instructive

here.

between the Bill of Rights and the rest of the

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, under -- under this Court's

21

decision -- decisions, Congress has been authorized to

22

allow States to regulate in areas it -- it would otherwise

not be able to, and when it does so, it's exercising its

own sovereign power, not power delegated by the Federal

Government.

The other -- the other instructive example is

Indian law prior to the adoption of the Constitution,

5

States have not been able to exercise jurisdiction over

1

QUESTION:

And -- and since this has nothing to

2

do with prior Indian tribal power but simply with

3

arrangements that Congress chooses to adopt, it

4

necessarily follows that Congress could provide that

5

anyone in this room, whether an Indian -- whether an

6

enrolled Indian or not, could be subjected to trial by a

7

-- a tribal court and then subjected to a second trial,

8

despite the Double Jeopardy Clause, by a court of the

9

United States.

10

MR. KNEEDLER:

Congress could provide that.
Yes.

And --

12

Right?

QUESTION:

I -- I find it hard to think that

that's all that the Double Jeopardy Clause means.

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the -- this Court held in

15

Wheeler that prosecution by an Indian tribe of a -- of a

16

member of the tribe in that situation, followed by a

17

prosecution by the Federal Government for what would --

18

the same conduct, was not the same offense because the

19

ultimate authority to prosecute derived from different

20

sources.

21

And we think the same -QUESTION:

But derived from inherent tribal

22

authority, which had not been taken away.

What's

23

different here is that it had been taken away and was

given back, and it's hard to decide -- it's hard to

consider that inherent tribal authority, even though the

-- the statute refers to it that way.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, it -- I -- I think by

inherent what the Court meant in both Oliphant and -- and

4

in Duro was original sovereignty that has continued

5

unlimited or unrestricted down to the present day.

other words, it -- it has been -- it has been allowed to

provides a limitation to -- you know, to jurisdiction over

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

14

QUESTION:

Well, I -- I --

It doesn't matter what has been

15

allowed to -- to continue down to the present day.

16

Congress can change all of that and permit jurisdiction

17

over non-tribal members and, it necessarily follows,

18

permit jurisdiction over non-Indians without violating the

19

Double Jeopardy Clause.

20

MR. KNEEDLER:

If -- if we -- if we look at the

21

reality of the nature of the prosecutions here, this was a

22

prosecution brought by tribal officials in a tribally

23

constituted court enforcing provisions of tribal law, not

24

title 18, under a tribal constitution.

25

QUESTION:

That --

Are you saying that Congress could

require the trial of non-Indians before a -- an Indian

2

tribal court?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

I -- I believe the -- this

4

Court's decision in -- in Oliphant says so in several

5

respects.

6

the Court said in Oliphant is that the -- the tribes

7

necessarily lost their dependent -- excuse me -- by virtue

8

of their dependent status, lost their ability to prosecute

9

non-Indians except in a manner acceptable to Congress.

What the Court -- in several locations.

What

10

the -- the Court necessarily assumed that Congress could

11

revest this authority in the Indian tribes.

12

QUESTION:

So

This is maybe -- it's very

13

interesting.

14

then that the rights that the individual tribe gets is a

function of the Due Process Clause.

applicable.

for distinguishing between whether the defendant in such a

case is, A, a member of that tribe; B, a non-tribe member

25

Suppose -- I would think on your approach

And -- and is there

apply of its own force to the tribe.

is the Indian Civil Rights Act.

4

that void by -- by -- as a statutory matter requiring that

5

certain rights be --

6

QUESTION:

But what does apply

What -- Congress filled

Well, the statute isn't going to help

7

in terms of my question because I'm interested in

8

Congress' power.

9

MR. KNEEDLER:

10
11

QUESTION:

I -- I think --

And -- and maybe we don't have to

reach that in this case.

12

MR. KNEEDLER:

13

QUESTION:

14

Yes.

I -- I think --

And maybe the answer to this case

makes no difference in respect to that.

15

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I think -- I think in asking

16

a due process question, you might be asking -- a

17

procedural due process question, you might be asking an

18

equal protection type question.

19
20

QUESTION:

I'm asking a question in respect to

right to counsel, for example.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Right -- right to counsel is not

to the Indian Civil Rights Act, you can -- you can -- and

MR. KNEEDLER:

QUESTION:

You -- you can
You -- you

Yes.

But to now extend the Government's

11

power to subject people to this kind of trial beyond

12

members of the -- of the tribe that -- that has the tribal

13

court to members of other tribes and, as you necessarily

14

acknowledge, even to non-Indians, that's a -- that's a

15

step I'm -- I'm not prepared to contemplate.

16

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, with -- first of all, with

17

respect to members of tribes other than the prosecuting

18

tribe, Congress in the exercise of its plenary authority

19

over tribes we think certainly should have the power to

20

regulate the relationship among tribes, tribes with each

21

other, and relationships of tribes and their respective

22

members with each other.

Mr. Kneedler, just to bring it back

14

to this case, as I understand it, there was no due process

MR. KNEEDLER:

I think it's important to -- to consider the

12

scope of Congress' plenary powers within the framework of

13

the structure of the Constitution itself.

14

QUESTION:

The --

But -- but -- so -- so what you're

15

saying is that if the Court has very substantial concerns

16

over the Government's proposition that within the

17

territorial United States a non-constitutional entity can

18

be allowed to try a United States citizen, if we have

19

concerns about that, you're giving us no ability to draw a

20

line so that you can prevail in this case.

21

seems to me that you are conceding, by your last

statement, that if we rule in favor of your position, it

must necessarily apply to non-Indians.

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

Here we're talking about --

this case involves non-member Indians, and as I said, the

5

ability of Congress to regulate relationships between

6

tribes and -- and their members would seem to be at the

7

core of the power.

And as this Court has said in its federalism

QUESTION:

If we take your approach then in

14

we'd have to say that the first prosecution doesn't count

5

MR. REICHERT:

Your Honor, I believe that

6

Congress' intent was clear on two points.

7

was that they were attempting to restore tribal

8

sovereignty, which they cannot do by its definition.

9

they were also clearly trying to close a jurisdictional

11

Under the Government's contention, the entire

12

statute should be thrown out and neither one of those

13

clear intents from Congress can be saved.

14

-- under what the Eighth Circuit did and under what I'm

asking this Court to do, the -- one of those intents can

be saved and that is --

5

later just repealed the statute.

6

delegated the power to elect the chiefs the way they did

7

it for 100 years?

8
9

MR. REICHERT:

Would they then have

I think technically they would,

but in that situation it's -- it's not so important

10

whether they're using a delegated power or a sovereign

11

power because this case presents unique facts where

12

sovereignty becomes of paramount importance because of

13

this Court's adoption of the dual sovereignty doctrine.

14

In many instances, Congress delegates authority and it --

15

the importance of whether it be a delegation or whether it

16

be a -- a re-recognition or a restoration of inherent

17

tribal sovereignty is not nearly as important.

18

that case, I think it would be a delegation of Federal

19

power, but I don't think it would affect the election of

20

the tribal chairmen.

United States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

I

1

would have thought it had considerable power there.

2

if it can do it there, why can't it do it here?

3

And

I mean, you could enter into a treaty changing

4

the nature of the sovereign power and the House of

5

Representatives and the Senate have basically taken to

6

themselves through statute the treaty-making authority.

7

And so what's -- why is this any different from -- from

8

redefining the nature of the sovereign relationship

9

between, say, Guam, Puerto Rico, a whole -- you know,

10

those entities that are not States?

11

MR. REICHERT:

When Congress acts with -- as it

12

acts towards Puerto Rico, it can use its treaty powers and

13

not be conferring sovereign power on Puerto Rico.

14

Puerto Rico is considerably --

15

QUESTION:

Suppose it does.

And

Suppose it says the

16

commonwealth, which is a totally uncertain concept,

17

henceforth means A, B, C, D, and E.

18

now, whether that's wise or not wise I have no idea, but I

19

don't see anything in the Constitution that would stop

20

Congress from doing that.

21

why is there here where, in fact -- I don't want to repeat

22

myself.

23

All right?

Now --

And if there is nothing there,

But my understanding of this is that over the

24

years Congress has, through legislation -- or Congress has

25

changed the making of the treaty to define the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

relationship into a situation where we define the

2

relationship with the Indian tribes through legislation.

3

QUESTION:

What about Philippines?

4

QUESTION:

At least I don't see why they --

5

QUESTION:

I assume we did precisely that with

6

the Philippines, and I -- I guess Justice Breyer is

7

suggesting that we can simply revoke Philippine

8

independence, which we -- which we graciously gave them,

9

and now, since it was all done through the treaty power,

10

we can just revoke it.

11
12

QUESTION:

But this is the opposite.

I suppose

we could --

13

MR. REICHERT:

To address that, Puerto Rico is

14

different than a State and Puerto Rico and States are very

15

different from tribes.

16

They are a unique body within our constitutional

17

framework.

18

Tribes are dependent nations.

And when Congress acts in relation to tribes,

19

they can act in a number of different ways.

20

Congress can completely take away a tribe's sovereignty,

21

but it cannot restore that sovereignty once it's -- it has

22

taken it away.

23

this is --

change that relationship, or at least it hasn't changed

that relationship of -- of dependent sovereignty.

23

A second way that -- that is being explored here

is -- is on the assumption that Congress by some act took

25

away the sovereignty to prosecute non-tribal members and

I'm not sure what the answer should be in the

second case, but I thought your argument depended on the

first case or the first example.

MR. REICHERT:

6

QUESTION:

Is -- is that correct?

The --

In other words, it's -- it's the

7

sovereign relationship rather than an act of Congress that

8

takes away that is crucial for understanding the issue

here.

10

MR. REICHERT:

If I could just -- it's this

11

Court that said that that -- that recognized -- and its

12

role is to say what the law is -- looked at the dependent

13

nature of the Indian tribes and said this does not exist.

14

This power to prosecute --

Can I interrupt --

Do we -- we have to get --

4

QUESTION:

What transformed the tribes from

5

independent sovereigns to dependent sovereigns was not a

6

decision of this Court and the act of Congress.

7

the acts of the legislature and they took over a lot of

8

things that were previously independent sovereignty of the

9

tribes.

It was

And if you go back a couple hundred years, they

10

clearly had their own inherent power to try non-members.

11

Maybe they lost it in the change in the relationship

12

between the United States and the tribe, but that's not as

13

a result of an act of Congress or a decision of this

14

Court.

It's the result of historical events.

15

MR. REICHERT:

It's a result, Your Honor, of

16

their accepting the dependent -- accepting the protection

17

and the benefits and the burdens of the United States.

18

And that boils down to the essential question which is who

19

has the -- who has the final authority on what the limits

20

on inherent sovereignty are.

21

Congress?

22

Is it this body or is it

And -QUESTION:

Essentially the trouble I have with

23

your case is that it depends on making a distinction

24

between the status of -- of Indian sovereignty which

25

hasn't yet been taken away but which exists totally the

does not allow the Double Jeopardy Clause to be invoked

because -- I don't know what.

that dependent sovereignty?

Congress acts to take it away, then it can't give it back.

6

And that, you say, is not -- is -- that

You call that sovereignty,
But you say, however, if

It seems to me in both cases whatever power the

7

Indian tribe has is power that exists at the pleasure of

8

the United States, and I don't know why in -- the one case

9

is any better than the other as far as the Double Jeopardy

10

Clause is concerned.

Whatever power they exercise, they

11

exercise because we let them exercise it.

12

right?

13

MR. REICHERT:

14

QUESTION:

Isn't that

That's right, and --

Well, why shouldn't the -- I mean, I

15

-- I -- if the Double Jeopardy Clause doesn't apply in one

16

situation, it seems to me it shouldn't apply in the other.

MR. REICHERT:

And Billy Jo Lara was prosecuted

using Federal power, and that's -- and that's the premise.

He -- when he was prosecuted by the tribe, he was

prosecuted using Federal power.

QUESTION:

And then his subsequent

of the tribe?

I think that it should apply.

QUESTION:

To -- to any Indian tribal

prosecution of its own -- even of its own members.
MR. REICHERT:

Because this Court said in United

5

States v. Wheeler that the -- the member of a tribe has

6

accepted the benefits and the burdens of being a member of

7

that tribe, and one of the burdens is that the Bill of

8

Rights does not apply.

9

can decide to leave his or her tribe and no longer be a

And at any time that tribal member

10

member, no longer accept the benefits and no longer accept

11

the burdens, which is the fundamental unfairness of either

12

placing a non-Indian or a non-member Indian before a

13

tribal court which does not give that person their full

14

constitutional rights.

15

QUESTION:

So -- so the answer then to the due

16

process problem, which you've just given, is that the --

17

the member -- the tribal member, the non-tribal Indian,

18

and the non-Indian are all persons subject to the Due

19

Process Clause, but what counts is due process may vary

20

between whether you are a tribal member or not because of

21

the argument you just gave.

22

solves that problem.

23

Now, if that's so, that

Then we're back to the question of why not allow

24

Congress to define sovereignty.

I thought Justice

25

Scalia's point was a very good point to mention the

1

Philippines.

2

authority in the United States to give the Philippines

3

independence?

4

making that kind of decision through a congressional law,

5

why could we not do the same to the Indian tribes?

6

If you reverse it, don't we have the

And if in fact, we get into the habit of

And if there is a boundary there, it must have

7

to do with the nature of a Constitution of the United

8

States, not some language.

9

that would suggest that in doing this, that boundary is

10

passed.

11
12

And I can't find anything here

So what's -- what's the answer to that kind of
argument?

13

MR. REICHERT:

Your Honor, as I understand your

14

question, you're looking for where in the Constitution

15

Congress has the power or this -- or this body has the

16

power.

17

QUESTION:

To the contrary.

I'm saying

18

naturally Congress has the power to take, let's say,

19

something that is not a State -- it is like Puerto Rico or

20

the Philippines -- and to say we are changing the status

21

of that entity.

22

Now, I would think you'd start from the

23

proposition that they do have the power to define the

24

relationship of entities that are not States to the United

25

States.

Now, if there is a limit on that, it must be
39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

found either explicitly, which I can't find, or implicitly

2

in the nature of the constitutional document itself.

3

am looking to you to tell me any kind of limit like that

4

which might prevent what Congress tried to do here.

5

MR. REICHERT:

So I

Congress has specific enumerated

6

powers in the Constitution.

7

enumerated powers -- and the Government has pointed to no

8

specific enumerated powers that allows Congress to take

9

the action they did.

10

QUESTION:

Nowhere in those specific

I want to turn the question then.

11

Which is the power that allowed us to give independence to

14

Relations Act that defines the relationship with Puerto

15

Rico?

16

powers in the -- I'm not saying they're not there.

17

saying that I'm not an expert in this area and I -- I'd

18

like you to make this argument of where they are.

19

Which is the power that allowed us to

Which is the power -- where -- where are these

MR. REICHERT:

In the Treaty Clause.

I'm

And

20

Congress and the executive branch can have relations with

21

other nations through the Treaty Clause and can define

22

their relation.

23

But this Court has said that dealings with the

24

tribe is more than treaties and more than statutes, that

25

it also depends on the relationship of the tribes to this
40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

dependent nation.

And in giving their -- in -- in

2

accepting the protection of the United States, the tribes

3

accepted the burdens and necessarily gave up certain

4

aspects of their sovereignty.

5

QUESTION:

Now, my impression is that we used to

6

do this through treaty, but at some point the House of

7

Representatives was somewhat unhappy about not having a

8

role in this and therefore it became changed such that the

9

relationship with the Indian tribes is defined through

10

agreement ratified and enacted into law by both houses of

11

Congress.

12

Now, was that unconstitutional to do that?
MR. REICHERT:

I'm not sure that it was -- if it

13

was unconstitutional or not, but I don't think that's the

14

important distinction, Your Honor.

15

distinction is is where does this power to now deal with

16

Indian tribes and to -- what they're trying to do is

17

define sovereignty and take any role that this Court has

18

in defining sovereignty away.

QUESTION:

What the important

Under the Government's

Well, I -- I suppose that if this

21

Court said that the nature of sovereignty is such that it

22

has certain limits and that this is imposed because of the

23

Constitution and because of long use, perhaps Congress

24

couldn't change it.

25

But we haven't said that.

MR. REICHERT:

That's all.

Insofar as the territories, because that's under

this case.

7

MR. REICHERT:

And Congress is already

8

attempting to -- with the Hicks fix to overrule Hicks,

9

Montana, and Oliphant.

And if this Court gives to

10

Congress all the powers that the Government is asking them

11

to --

12

QUESTION:

That may well be a different case

13

because then we're concerned with the powers of -- of

14

Indian tribes as a historical matter of their sovereignty

15

over citizens of the United States who have direct

16

relations, responsibilities, obligations, and rights both

17

with their States and with the National Government, and

18

under the insular cases, the Constitution applies with

Then you're making a -- then you're

making a constitutional argument and it's an appropriate

I -- I just don't think you need that

11

MR. REICHERT:

In -- and thank you.

The -- and it is -- it is

12

critically important to look at what a tribe -- what

13

powers a tribe exerts over its members and what -- what

14

somebody who is a member of a tribe traveling across the

15

country, traveling across an interstate highway and is not

16

a member of that tribe, comes onto a reservation for no

17

reason other than to get through that reservation --

18

QUESTION:

What about someone who lives on the

19

reservation, marries a woman who is a member of the tribe?

20

Why doesn't the tribe have at least the sovereign

21

authority -- it's always at the sufferance of Congress,

22

but to say when things go wrong on our reservation, when

23

our people are hurt, we are entitled to prosecute the

wrongdoer?

MR. REICHERT:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

subject non-Indians to tribal jurisdiction as well.

That's a contact --

I believe that that's in my

I don't have that cite in front of me.

The -- but in -- in Duro this Court said that in

14

the criminal -- that the criminal context is unique, and

15

that in the -- in the realm of criminal law, we must first

16

look -- no matter what we think of history, no matter what

17

our interpretation is of history and statutes and

18

treaties, this must be examined under the guise that Billy

19

Jo Lara, or in that case Albert Duro, is a citizen first

20

and foremost of the United States.

21

QUESTION:

But then you've given the answer to

22

your own question.

If you're right -- if you're right

23

that this does -- is absolutely, you know, a violation of

24

due process to subject the non-tribal member, say, to a

25

trial without a lawyer, well, then you would win, but not
44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

this case.

What you would win is a case where there was

2

an appeal from the tribal prosecution, and under those

3

circumstances, they had raised the question just as you

4

phrased it, say it may not violate due process, for the

5

reasons you gave, not to give the tribal member a lawyer,

6

but it does violate due process for Congress to pass a law

7

which subjects me to this criminal trial without a lawyer

8

because I am not a tribal member.

9

there is a vehicle to make that claim and you will win or

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

22

MR. KNEEDLER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

23

The first point I'd like to make is that this

case only involves the question of whether Congress can

authorize tribes to exercise jurisdiction over Indians who

2

tribes, not non-member Indians.

3

significant because it calls into -- into play additional

4

powers that Congress has in this area particularly

5

defining the attributes of membership in a tribe.

6

Congress has -- among those attributes are the eligibility

7

for special benefits, educational benefits, health

to identify another attribute of membership or affiliation

enacted this statute in 1991.

QUESTION:

And that is important to law and order on

Is it correct that a defendant in the

24

case right before the trial starts could disavow his

25

Indian status?

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

He could not -- I -- I think

2

he -- as long as he was affiliated at the time of the

3

conduct, I think -- I think the -- the consequences would

4

5

QUESTION:

I wonder if that -- why that would

6

follow?

7

anytime before judgment he should -- he could say I'm

8

stopped being an Indian.

9

If he had that absolute right, it seems to me

MR. KNEEDLER:

No.

I -- I think -- I think

10

Congress at least under the Necessary and Proper Clause

11

could allow a tribe to maintain jurisdiction over

12

something that happened while the person was tribally

13

affiliated.

14

The -- another fundamental point is the one that

15

Justice Breyer mentioned is that there is nothing in the

16

Constitution that prohibits, the places a limit in this

17

situation on Congress' exercise of its plenary power over

18

Indian affairs.

19

Constitution that points to the contrary.

20

Constitution refers to the Indian tribes, and as this

21

Court has said, that reference to tribes and to the

22

treaty-making power recognizes tribes as sovereigns, not

23

simply voluntary organizations, but in the Constitution

24

itself recognizes them as sovereigns.

25

said that because of those powers and implicit from that

And in fact, there's much in the

is the power of Congress to exercise protective authority

2

over Indian tribes.

protection of tribal -- tribes from crimes committed by

4

other tribal members.

5

And here that protection includes

In solving this serious law enforcement problem,

6

Congress was entitled to be guided by the Constitution

7

itself which recognizes the tribes as sovereign and to

8

vest authority in them as sovereign rather than act in

9

derogation of the Constitution by deeming the tribes to be

10

agents of the Federal Government when a tribal prosecutor

11

is bringing a prosecution under tribal law in -- in tribal

12

court.

13

And Congress could rationally reach this

14

conclusion for another important reason, and that is the

15

lesson in history.

16

affairs, and Congress throughout history, since 1817 under

17

a jurisdictional regime that remains in effect, has left

18

to tribes the power to exercise jurisdiction over members

19

of other tribes, as this Court said in United States v.

20

Rodgers where it construed the Indian against Indian

21

exception as intended to allow tribe matters not -- and it

22

expressly said, not only with -- with their own tribe but

23

other tribes, to be left to the tribe.

QUESTION:

History is very important in Indian

Could the Congress define a -- a

criminal offense between one Indian as another Indian and

Yes.

a second trial.
