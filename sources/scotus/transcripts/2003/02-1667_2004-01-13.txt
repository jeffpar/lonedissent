ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL E. MOORE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10

MR. MOORE: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may
it please the Court:
Whether the Court chooses to view Title II of

11

the Americans with Disabilities Act in the entirety of its

12

indiscriminate application through every facet of every

13

state program, activity, and service, or in the

14

alternative, as the private respondents urge, in the

15

narrow courthouse access context, presented by the

16

particular allegations of the complaint they have filed in

17

this case, the Court should conclude that Title II exceeds

18

Congress' enforcement authority under section 5 of the

19

Fourteenth Amendment for essentially two reasons.

20

First, because there was no evidence before

21

Congress that the states were involved in a widespread

22

pattern of violations of the Fourteenth Amendment rights

23

of disabled persons when the ADA was enacted in 1990.

24

second, because Title II shares all of the incongruent and

25

disproportionate features that proved fatal to Title I of

And

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

the same statute in the Garrett case and then some.
Title II's lack of congruence and

3

proportionality to any identified constitutional injury

4

inflicted upon disabled persons by the states is apparent,

5

we say, on the face of the statute.

6

effort to tailor its provisions to those contexts which

7

might conceivably pose a threat to the exercise of

8

fundamental constitutional rights by individuals with

9

disabilities.

10
11

Congress made no

Instead, Title II applies indiscriminately

to every service, program, or activity of the states.
QUESTION: Let's assume that the - that the state

12

- and it's just an assumption - would concede that

13

sovereign immunity could be abrogated insofar as access to

14

courthouses for handicapped people, so that Congress could

15

have drafted a congruent and proportional statute.

16

fact that this injury comes within a statute which has a

17

much larger coverage is grounds for striking the statute

18

down, even though this case involves what we will assume

19

to be a - an injury that could be remedied under the

20

Fourteenth Amendment with money damages?

21

The

MR. MOORE: Your Honor's question focuses on a

22

debate that we really haven't engaged in.

23

between the respondents and the United States, because in

24

our view, whether the Court views the statute in its - in

25

overall operation, or as focused narrowly on the

It's - it's one

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

courthouse access context, either analysis leads to the

2

same conclusion.

3

Having said that, I would say that the

4

prohibition of Title II is a single, unitary, very elegant

5

one-sentence prohibition in section 12132 of Title 42.

6

doesn't purport to subdivide the statute - the statute's

7

prohibitions into particular subject matter areas.

8

the United States points out in its brief, this Court's

9

prior congruence and proportionality cases in - in the

It

And as

10

abrogation context suggest that the Court looks usually at

11

the overall operation of the statute.

12

If the Court chooses that perspective on this

13

problem, we think yes indeed, even if the statute,

14

assuming the statute, a narrowly-tailored statute could

15

have been drafted that would validly abrogate sovereign

16

immunity in the courthouse access context, Title II's flaw

17

is that it is not so targeted.

18

activities it covers, Your Honor, a very small percentage

19

conceivably implicate the exercise of any constitutional

20

right.

In fact, of the myriad

21

QUESTION: Mr. Moore, does Tennessee provide any

22

cause of action for the alleged violations here, the lack

23

of access to the courthouse?

24
25

MR. MOORE: No private right of action under our
State Public Buildings Act.

Our State Public Buildings

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Act, Your Honor, was enacted in 1970.

2

buildings constructed on or after that date.

3

It applied to all

QUESTION: So you're satisfied that under

4

Tennessee law, there would be no monetary relief

5

available?

6
7
8
9
10

MR. MOORE: I think that is - I think that is
right.
QUESTION: And would there be any enforcement
action at all available to compel under Tennessee law the
courthouses to be accessible?

11

MR. MOORE: No, Your Honor, because under

12

Tennessee law, the - the injunction to build fully

13

accessible buildings applies to buildings constructed

14

after the enactment of the Public Buildings Act in 1970.

15

There is no provision in the Public Buildings Act

16

requiring retrofitting.

17

Tennessee does not dispute its obligation to comply with

18

Title II, and we do not dispute that our state officials

19

can be called to account for a failure to comply with the

20

provisions of Title II in an Ex parte Young action.

21

But, of course, in this case,

QUESTION: Well, do you take the position that

22

Title II, even if this Court were to find monetary damages

23

are not available, is there a way to enforce Title II by

24

the Federal Government against the State of Tennessee?

25

MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor, there is, in an

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

enforcement action by the United States, injunctive relief

2

and monetary damages would be available against the state.

3

In addition -

4
5

QUESTION: Under what power?

I guess - I guess

you're arguing that there's no section 5 authority -

6

MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.

7

QUESTION: - for enactment of this provision.

8

And that would leave what, the Commerce Clause?

9

MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.

10
11

QUESTION: And you think it would survive the
Commerce Clause challenge, do you, as applied to states?

12
13

MR. MOORE: Your - Your Honor, of course, this this case doesn't present that question.

14

QUESTION: Right.

15

MR. MOORE: But -

16

QUESTION: But I'm asking.

17

MR. MOORE: But we have not challenged and do not

18

question Congress' -

19
20

QUESTION: Other states have though, have they
not?

21

MR. MOORE: I - it's my understanding that that

22

claim has been raised in certain lower Federal courts,

23

yes.

24
25

QUESTION: How about an action under Ex parte
Young -

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. MOORE: Absolutely, Your Honor.

2

QUESTION: - against a state official, not for

3

money damages, but for compliance?

4

MR. MOORE: Absolutely, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION: Well, I can understand that if the

6

state official was standing at the door saying, no, you

7

cannot bring a wheelchair in here.

8

itself simply does not allow for - for - for ready access,

9

how would an Ex parte Young action be a source of remedy?

10

But if the building

MR. MOORE: Well, of course, Your Honor, Title II

11

doesn't really apply to buildings.

12

services, programs, and activities, and so long as they -

13

It applies to

QUESTION: Well, if the - if the activity - the -

14

the conduct of - of the business of courts is taking

15

place in a courthouse, I think that gets us to focus on

16

the building, doesn't it?

17

MR. MOORE: But so long as the - so long as the

18

court in question offers the service in - in a - in

19

another venue, for example, as occurred in this case, Mr.

20

- at every step of Mr. Lane's interaction with the Polk

21

County criminal court, an accommodation was offered to

22

him, albeit it was rejected.

23

QUESTION: So they're - they're saying, look, you

24

- you could have an Ex parte order - Young order - saying

25

hold court on the first floor.

That's - that's what

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

you're getting at?

Okay.

MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, the - I - I

3

should think a - a court could fashion whatever remedy is

4

- is deemed appropriate to ensure that a - a person in Mr.

5

Lane's circumstance enjoys the full panoply of his - of

6

his constitutional rights in - in -

7

QUESTION: But I - I take it your position would

8

be that under Ex parte Young, a court could not say to a

9

state official, build an elevator?

10

MR. MOORE: Well, I think courts have wide

11

discretion to fashion injunctive relief in Ex parte Young

12

actions, and if, in a particular circumstance, that were

13

the only reasonable way of delivering the service, I - I

14

think that would be inappropriate.

15
16
17

QUESTION: So you would as - as a last ditch, you
would concede that?
MR. MOORE: Yes.

I think - I think in an Ex

18

parte Young action, courts have enormous discretion to

19

fashion equitable relief that is appropriate to - to

20

whatever the particular facts and circumstances are

21

presented -

22

QUESTION: But that would still be Commerce

23

Clause-based, right?

24

Fourteenth Amendment altogether.

25

Because you're excluding the

MR. MOORE: That would be true, Your Honor, yes.

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: And there is something strange about

2

that, given that it was Congress' purpose to enable people

3

to exercise the rights - the full rights of citizenship.

4

I mean, it's a kind of a dignity right that Congress was

5

recognizing, and it doesn't fit as comfortably under the

6

Commerce Clause, does it, as it would under the Fourteenth

7

Amendment?

8
9

MR. MOORE: I think it fits quite comfortably
under - under the Commerce Clause, Your Honor.

But, of

10

course, under this Court's case law, in order to invoke

11

its Section 5 power, Congress had to have evidence before

12

it or some reason to believe that the states were engaged

13

in a widespread pattern of violating the constitutional

14

rights of disabled or - or - of - of whatever group is

15

involved, and here there was no such evidence, certainly

16

not in the courthouse access context.

17

QUESTION: Well, what about the - that's what I

18

want to get to.

19

you, I'm assuming we're talking here to use the statute

20

about judicial or courthouse-related services, programs,

21

or activities.

22

applied challenge, and if it's constitutional in this

23

area, maybe we leave the other areas for a later time.

24
25

I - I mean, to put the whole question to

So I was seeing this as a kind of as-

Now, on that assumption, as you well know and I
do, the majority criticized my appendix in Garrett -

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.

3

QUESTION: - for certain inadequacies.

And among

4

those inadequacies which it highlighted was, one, the

5

inadequacy that it talked about public employment instead

6

of, says the majority, public accommodations and public

7

services.

8

and public services.

9
10

Here we're talking about public accommodations
Second, the majority criticized it -

I'm, you know, aware of these criticisms, I read them
carefully.

11

(Laughter.)

12

QUESTION: The - the - the - criticized it

13

because the Senate reports hadn't said anything.

14

here the committee report talks - says discrimination

15

still persists in such critical areas as public

16

accommodations and public services.

17

concurring opinion says there is no record of litigation

18

on this point and the SG has filed a whole brief with

19

loads of - and fourth, the majority made a major point of

20

there being a relaxed, rational basis standard of judicial

21

review, but here we have access to a courthouse, something

22

that would seem to call for more strict scrutiny than

23

that.

24
25

All right.

Well,

And third, the - the

Those are the four things that I

could see as distinguishing this case, and I think it's

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2

reasonable to ask you, why don't they?
MR. MOORE: They don't, Your Honor.

Let me take

3

each one in turn.

First of all, in the appendix to the

4

Solicitor General's brief, indeed, if the Court will look

5

at all of the hundreds of pages of briefs filed in this

6

case by respondents and their amici, the Court will not

7

find a single case from a single jurisdiction that has

8

held that anytime, anywhere in the United States, a

9

person's fundamental constitutional rights of access to

10

the courts has been denied as the result of architectural

11

barriers at courthouses.

12

which one would expect to find case law, it is in the

13

courthouse access context, because after all, the business

14

that takes place there is litigation.

15

particularly telling point.

16

And if there's one context in

We think that is a

Similarly, in - we find in the Government's

17

brief, who has - the Government has called from Your

18

Honor's appendix the pertinent entries, and we find eight

19

of them that have sufficient detail that would permit one

20

to actually ask the question, was a constitutional

21

violation involved?

22

most creative interpretation of any of them, they don't

23

make out a constitutional violation.

24

references to courthouses in appendix C to Your Honor's

25

opinion, we've pulled every single one of them, and they

And we say that under the - even the

All of the other

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

simply - they simply label courthouse facilities as

2

inaccessible.

3

But, of course, under the ADA, inaccessible is a

4

term of art.

5

around the building and no one can get in.

6

they are inaccessible in the sense that the - the

7

amenities required by the ADA are not present, so that

8

there are not - there is no evidence before this Court,

9

and there was no evidence before Congress, that anyone's

It doesn't mean there's literally a wall
It means that

10

constitutional rights, rights of access to the courts,

11

were being violated as the result of the existence of

12

these architectural barriers.

13

don't think the - the so-called task force report, which

14

is summarized in the appendix to Your Honor's dissent in

15

Garrett, helps the respondents.

16

And for those reasons, we

There is no mention in the text of the act

17

itself, of course, of courthouse access, and if one looks

18

at the Senate and House reports on the legislation, one

19

will discover that there is not a single mention of the

20

subject anywhere and no other indication that Congress

21

thought courthouse access was a matter of particular

22

concern.

23

QUESTION: Mr. Moore, I'm sort of concerned about

24

this.

25

scope of Congress' - whether Congress' power under the

Our prior cases dealing with this issue of - of the

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Fourteenth Amendment has been properly exercised, none of

2

our prior cases parse it out issue by issue.

3

example, doesn't - doesn't just limit it to, you know, to

4

- to whether, given that there was no - no discrimination

5

in this case, Congress could move.

6

Boerne, for

You're - what you're -

the State of Tennessee is entirely happy to have us

7

change course and begin to rule upon congressional

8

legislation of this sort, case by case -

9
10

MR. MOORE: No, Your Honor.
QUESTION: - whether there was enough evidence on

11

courthouses, whether there was enough evidences - enough

12

evidence on each of the other innumerable state functions

13

that - that were covered by this bill.

14

that's the argument you're making.

15

to - to say there's not enough evidence about courthouses,

16

and therefore, in this case, they can't do it.

17

hear - we'll hear another case further down the line

18

about, you know, any of the other innumerable state

19

functions that are impinged upon by this law.

20

But, I mean,

You - you just want us

And we'll

MR. MOORE: I would agree with Your Honor that -

21

that the Court's prior abrogation cases, each one of them

22

looks at the overall operation of the statutory scheme and

23

does not look at its application in a context-by-contact -

24
25

context basis.

And we would agree that if the Court

chooses to continue that practice and - and for many of

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the reasons discussed in the United States brief, we think

2

that is probably the better view of it, this statute

3

clearly falls, because under no circumstances can - can

4

one say that it - it - it is congruent and proportional to

5

a valid, remedial objective.

6

QUESTION: How - how do you do that?

Because if

7

I think of the antitrust laws, for example, or other

8

congressional statutes in olden days when the Court, you

9

know, was worried about the scope of the Commerce Clause,

10

what would happen is they would say, of course the

11

antitrust law is valid, the statute's valid, but it's not

12

valid to apply it to baseball, because baseball's not an

13

interstate commerce, or it's not valid to apply it to

14

insurance.

15

approach here, that this statute may be valid as applied

16

to X, Y, and Z, where they did have enough evidence, but

17

not A, B, and C, where they didn't?

18

Well, why wouldn't the Court take the same

MR. MOORE: I - because I think the abrogation

19

inquiry is fundamentally different.

20

inquiry focuses on whether Congress invoked its power

21

under Section 5 in a fashion that is congruent and

22

proportional with a valid, remedial objective, that being

23

a - a - an identified pattern of unconstitutional

24

behavior.

25

The abrogation

MR. MOORE: And in order to - excuse me, Mr.
Chief Justice.

3

QUESTION: In City of Boerne, we certainly did

4

not go in and analyze whether the church has a claim under

5

the Constitution or not.

6

MR. MOORE: That's true.

That's true, and - and

7

the same can be said of the Kimel case.

8

focus on the peculiar allegations of the complaint in that

9

case.

10

The Court didn't

QUESTION: Justice Breyer's question, how can you

11

do that, reminds me of, you know, there's a story about

12

the Baptist minister who was asked whether he believed in

13

total immersion baptism, and he said, believe in it, I've

14

seen it done.

15

(Laughter.)

16

QUESTION: And that - that is surely the

17

situation here.

18

other cases involving this area.

19

We've done it before in - in each of the

MR. MOORE: Yes, Your Honor.

The statute lacks

20

congruence and proportionality also, not just because of

21

its sheer breadth, which Justice Scalia's question

22

highlights, but also because in the myriad contexts to

23

which it applies, it imposes obligations on the state that

24

go far beyond what the Constitution itself commands.

25

It really does so in two ways generally.

First,

16
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

most of the rules under Title II promulgated by the

2

Justice Department to enforce its provisions require

3

states to modify otherwise disability-neutral policies and

4

practices in order to eliminate adverse, disparate effects

5

those policies may have on the interests of disabled

6

persons, whereas, as this Court noted in the Garrett case

7

itself, under the Fourteenth Amendment, disparate -

8

disparate effects of that - those sorts, without more, do

9

not make out any sort of constitutional violation.

10
11

Second

- yes, Your Honor?
QUESTION: I was going to ask you to get out of

12

the courthouse area of the case for a minute.

13

Government's brief contains a statement that in 1975,

14

approximately one million disabled students were excluded

15

entirely from the public school system.

16

true, and if - because of their disability, if that were

17

true, would that constitute a constitutional violation?

18
19
20

The

If that were

MR. MOORE: I don't think we have enough facts to
draw any conclusion.
QUESTION: And then my next question is, there's

21

nothing in the record - suppose you had several

22

Congressmen who said, I'm going to vote for this statute

23

because I'm convinced that this fact is true, but there's

24

nothing in the hearings, but - but it definitely motivated

25

the voting of people who voted for this statute, could -

17
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would it be valid in that fact, that situation?

2

have to have evidence in a - in a congressional hearing in

3

order to justify a congressional decision?

4

Or do we

MR. MOORE: I think there must be evidence of a

5

pattern of constitutional violations, and merely saying

6

that a particular class of persons is excluded from public

7

schools, for example -

8

QUESTION: Is it - is it -

9

MR. MOORE: - without more information doesn't

10

permit a conclusion necessarily that a constitutional

11

violation is going on.

12

QUESTION: Is it true then that in a case like

13

this, we must examine legislative history in order to

14

determine the validity of the statute?

15

MR. MOORE: Unless - I mean, there are certain

16

contexts where - where the - the history of discrimination

17

is so well known and has been documented in this Court's

18

own opinions, that perhaps that's unnecessary.

19

QUESTION: Well, it hasn't been - I'm assuming it

20

hasn't, but it's just clear that the Congressmen who voted

21

for the statute thought it was true.

22

from their constituents and acted on that sort of

23

information, and that - but that can never be sufficient

under your understanding of our cases?

the - in the record that establishes a state - state

3

participation in a widespread pattern of unconstitutional

4

behavior, yes, Your Honor.

5

QUESTION: Mr. Moore, you - you don't concede, I

6

assume, that the Constitution is violated by not - not

7

providing educational - public educational facilities that

8

will be accessible to all handicapped persons?

9

concede that that's a constitutional violation, do you?

You don't

10

MR. MOORE: No, I do not.

11

QUESTION: I didn't think it was.

12

MR. MOORE: The - the - and in fact -

13

QUESTION: I mean, you - you need a rational

14

No, I do not.

basis.

15

MR. MOORE: That's right.

16

QUESTION: And - and if - if the - the additional

17

expense for constructing the buildings in - in a manner

18

that would render them accessible to all handicapped

19

persons is excessive, it's not a constitutional violation.

20

Now, it may be a very bad idea, but we've never held that

21

that's a constitutional violation.

22
23
24
25

MR. MOORE: I - I think that's right, Your Honor.
The only QUESTION: So saying that so many handicapped
persons couldn't get into public schools would prove

nothing at all, would it?

2

MR. MOORE: I think you're absolutely right, Your

3

Honor.

4

heightened scrutiny in - in the education context is where

5

there was a - a - a punitive class-based exclusion, and -

6

The only context in which this Court has applied

and there only in the K through 12 context, and so merely

7

reciting that a certain number of students were being

8

excluded without more information, Your Honor, I think

9

would not make out a constitutional violation.

10

QUESTION: Just out of curiosity, in your view,

11

is the requirement that Congress have a kind of

12

legislative - I've called it an administrative or court

13

record - to document the evidence of unconstitutionality

14

of practices applicable only in Section 5 of the - of the

15

Fourteenth Amendment, or is something - is it a

16

constitutional requirement that applies to all the

17

provisions of Article I, including the Commerce Clause and

18

other provisions?

19

MR. MOORE: Quite frankly, I focused only on this

20

Court's cases construing Section 5 requirements in this

21

context.

22

Congress invokes one of its powers in a way that intrudes

23

upon the sovereignty of the states, it must document that

24

it has an adequate basis in fact for concluding that that

25

power exists.

But I - I think - I think Congress - when

QUESTION: It's like - it's like a mean question,

2

because if you - if you answered the question that they

3

had to be different, I'd said why, and if you answered the

4

question they'd have to be the same, each of us can cast

5

our minds over dozens of pieces of important legislation

6

where, let's say, the underpinning - let's take the

7

Copyright Clause or let's take any one of a dozen where

8

there isn't really much of a legislative record. I mean,

9

that's - do you want to say anything about that?

10

I mean,

that's the problem I see there.

11

MR. MOORE: Well, of course, here, this case

12

deals with a specific context, the - the - the invocation

13

of Congress' power to - to abrogate the state's sovereign

14

immunity, and it seems entirely reasonable for the Court

15

to construe section 5 as requiring that before the

16

Congress alters the Federal-state balance in such a grave

17

way, that it document very carefully its basis for doing

18

so.

1

QUESTION: That power exists only - only when, as

2

- as we - we found was not well-enough established in

3

Boerne, only when there has been a constitutional

4

violation by the states, so why isn't that an adequate

5

reason for the difference?

6

QUESTION: But is that quite correct?

Isn't it

7

true that under section 5 they prohibited the poll tax and

8

literacy tests, even though they'd been held permissible?

9

They were not unconstitutional, they were prophylactic

10

measures.
MR. MOORE: But that was, Your Honor, only after

12

a - a well-documented history of discrimination and

13

discriminatory application of those -

QUESTION: But you would agree that it's not
essential that there be a constitutional violation?
MR. MOORE: I - I think there must be evidence of
a pattern of a unconstitutional behavior.

The answer is no.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM J. BROWN

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS LANE AND JONES

MR. BROWN: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please
the Court:

10

Unlike Garrett and Kimel, and entirely

11

consistent with this Court's opinion in Hibbs, Title II as

12

applied to the case that is before the Court today

13

presents a constitutional application of the powers of

14

Congress under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

15

QUESTION: When you say, Mr. Brown, as applied to

16

the case that's before the Court, you're suggesting that

17

it can be kind of sliced up and just, say, address

18

courthouses?

19

MR. BROWN: Your Honor, please, I think the

20

history that this Court has used in the past is to focus

21

on the case and the circumstance and the issue that's

22

before the Court.

23

involves the fundamental right of access to the court.

we've taken that position.

2

the City of Boerne, the Government response must be

3

congruent and proportional, which suggests that there may

4

be constitutional violations, but they're simply not

5

sufficient to justify what Congress did.

6

meaning of - I understood - of the term, congruence

7

proportionality.

We have said, particularly in

That's the

Now, if you - if you simply focus down narrowly
enough and say, was there a constitutional violation in

10

denying the church the zoning, the - that really

11

eliminates the idea of proportionality entirely.

12

MR. BROWN: Respectfully, Chief Justice, the way

13

that I took Boerne was that this Court made a direct

14

statement to Congress that they had overstepped their

15

bounds in interpreting the First Amendment and the

16

Fourteenth Amendment and its applications.

17

looked directly at Congress and said not that in these

18

particular circumstances, but on this particular

19

constitutional issue, you went too far.

20

The Court

Now, what we're talking about in this case today

21

is not about whether or not Congress dealt with a

22

fundamental right.

23

we're talking about here is what I would suggest to the

24

Court the quintessential element of the Fourteenth

25

Amendment, and that is the right of each of us as

That's unquestionable.

3

QUESTION: The legislation doesn't deal with that

4

constitutional right.

5

know, due process and - and - and courthouses

6

specifically.

7

what you're saying is, because one of the innumerable

8

things that it embraces happens to involve a

9

constitutional right, the legislation is a valid exercise

It doesn't - doesn't mention, you

It - it embraces innumerable things.

10

of - of section 5 power as to that particular

11

constitutional right.

12

And

And I - that doesn't strike me as - as accurate.

13

If Congress wants to enact such a sweeping statute, a

14

statute that - that, in effect, as we said in Boerne --

15

what was going on in Boerne was that Congress was

16

rewriting the First Amendment, and here Congress is

17

rewriting the Equal Protection Clause essentially, saying

18

that - that - that there must be constitutionally or by

19

virtue of this - of this supposedly constitutionally

20

remedially statute, there must be equal treatment of - of

21

handicapped people.

22

And it - it seems to me it's exactly parallel to

23

what was going on in - in Boerne, rewriting the First

24

Amendment versus rewriting the Equal Protection Clause,

25

and we looked at the whole sweep of - of Congress' action,

not just at the particular First Amendment claim.

2

MR. BROWN: Justice Scalia, respectfully,

3

Congress does not have a real good record of writing

4

memorandum opinions.

5

law deals with the Fourteenth Amendment, and what the

6

statute says is that citizens, qualified citizens for

7

programs and services and activities of the state, have a

8

right to participate in those activities without having

9

the onerous issue of their disability come into play.

What it said specifically was, this

10

QUESTION: Mr. Brown, are you saying that these -

11

what fits within this statute would independently violate

12

the Constitution, and all that the statute does is

13

provide, in this case, a damage remedy?

14

MR. BROWN: I think it does.

15

QUESTION: So that in - in all the cases that

16

would fit under this legislation, someone could come in,

17

say, and seek injunctive relief -

18

MR. BROWN: Well, absolutely.

19

QUESTION: - for a violation of a constitutional

20
21

right?
MR. BROWN: Well, the beauty of Title II is that

22

we don't have to chase all those rabbits.

whose sole purpose and interest was, one, to make sure

25

that our courthouses in Tennessee were accessible, and

7

seat in - in a public stadium, which is also covered, or a

8

theater, and it's inaccessible to certain people with

9

disabilities, would that be a violation of the

10

Constitution, for which this statute provides a remedy?

MR. BROWN: It may not provide or deal with a

constitutional violation, but it certainly deals with a

16

audience of individuals in that particular stadium, and

that they wanted to go and hold up a sign that says, Mr.

19

President, make our buildings accessible.

21

that they can't get there implicates their right to

And - and let me give you this

Congress has the power to ensure that we as individuals

have all the rights of citizenship without reference to

20

I think we do have to establish a category.

21

that Title II nor this Court would ever suggest that

has to state a constitutional violation, because then it

takes away from the prophylaxis benefits of Title II.

MR. BROWN: Respectfully, Your Honor, that is why

Title II is there, to make the State of Tennessee

anticipate that problem, solve that problem, so our

citizens don't have to confront those obstacles and face

17

pain, suffering, and public humiliation as a condition of

discriminate against them.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL D. CLEMENT

8

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENT UNITED STATES

9
10
11

MR. CLEMENT: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and
may it please the Court:
Unlike Title I of the ADA, which regulates

12

states as employers and treats public and private

13

employers alike, Title II of the ADA focuses on states and

14

state governments as governments in their distinct role as

15

providers of public services.

16

focused specifically on the conduct of state and local

17

officials rather than simply extrapolating from the

18

experience of private employers.

19

As a result, Congress

Equally important, Congress in the statutory

20

findings and legislative reports, the same reports this

21

Court found lacking in the Garrett case because they did

22

not include specific findings of public sector

23

discrimination in employment, those same findings and

24

reports found persistent discrimination in such critical

25

areas as access to public services and voting.

Moreover,

35
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.

1

as this Court -

2

QUESTION: That - that - that's persuasive or

3

not, depending on what was meant by the term

4

discrimination.

5

handicapped were not accommodated by special provisions,

6

such as elevators, that might be quite true, but it would

7

also not be a constitutional violation, would it?

8
9
10

If it simply meant that - that the

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Justice Scalia, I think that
brings us to the second important distinction between
Title I and Title II, which is because -

11

QUESTION: Well, let - let's stay on your first

12

one.

13

Congress made that has anything to do with constitutional

14

violations by the states -

I'm - I'm - I'm waiting to hear what - what findings

15

MR. CLEMENT: Well, and - and -

16

QUESTION:

17
18

- which is the premise for this

legislation.
MR. CLEMENT: And again, Justice Scalia, I think

19

the problem in Garrett, when this Court saw findings of

20

discrimination in an area like employment discrimination,

21

that's governed by rational basis review, then there's

22

very little reason to think that the small "d", if you

23

will, discrimination Congress found resulted in

24

unconstitutional discrimination.

25

focuses on government services, many of which implicate

But because Title II

36
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

fundamental rights, there's every reason to believe that

2

when government - when - when the Congress found - take

3

voting for example - discrimination in voting, that they

4

were actually finding unconstitutional discrimination in

5

voting, because voting and access to polling places

6

triggers fundamental rights and heightened scrutiny.

7

as this Court recognized in -

8

QUESTION: Well -

9

MR. CLEMENT: - in the Hibbs case, when -

And

10

QUESTION: These two sections - these - these two

11

things were debated and - and passed simultaneously, or at

12

very different times?

13

MR. CLEMENT: Title I and Title II?

14

QUESTION: Right.

15

MR. CLEMENT: They - they passed at the same

16

time.

17

QUESTION: And - and they're - they're using

18

discrimination to mean one thing in - in one half and

19

another thing in the other half?

20

want to argue to the Court?

21

That's - that's what you

MR. CLEMENT: I think whatever way they were

22

using discrimination, I think that that finding of

23

discrimination is going to be much more likely to be

24

correlated with actual constitutional violations in an

25

area that implicates fundamental rights.

And I think when

37
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

there's a specific finding in the text of the legislation

2

itself of discrimination in voting, I think it's very

3

likely, given the heightened scrutiny that applies to

4

voting -

5

QUESTION: Okay.

You said - but now what - what

6

does it mean to say discrimination in voting?

7

mean that a person was actually not allowed to vote?

Does that

8

MR. CLEMENT: In - in some cases, Mr. Chief -

9

QUESTION: How - how many cases do they - do you

10

have where the person was not actually allowed to vote

11

instead of not being facilitated in the ability to vote?

12

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, let me say

13

the - the relevant congressional committee heard testimony

14

of individuals that were turned away from the voting place

15

on - on election day, so there is that kind of evidence.

16

Now, I can't articulate for you how many instances of that

17

there were.

18
19
20
21
22
23

QUESTION: What - what do you mean by turned
away?

Turned away because there was no elevator?
MR. CLEMENT: Turned away because there was no

elevator, turned away because QUESTION: Is - is that a constitutional
violation?

24

MR. CLEMENT: If - if the voting official tells

25

the individual, we - you can't vote here, because this -

38
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: He tells them -

2

MR. CLEMENT: - this is not accessible -

3

QUESTION: - we - we don't have an - we don't

4

have an elevator.

5

MR. CLEMENT: Right.

6

QUESTION: So if you want to get up to vote, you

If he tells them -

7

have to find assistance to get up there.

8

and this legislation is directed against it, and can

9

remedy it upon a suit by the United States, but is it a

10

It's very bad,

constitutional violation?

11

MR. CLEMENT: With respect, I think maybe you'd

12

need to know more, but if the individual in the polling

13

place is turning people away because of their disability

14

and they're not offering, don't worry, we have a school

15

down the road that is accessible, that's not the facts.

16

They're saying, you can't vote, I'm sorry, we don't have

17

the facilities.

18

violation.

19

I think that would state a constitutional

QUESTION: How - how many of these instances did

20

Congress find of people who were actually refused the

21

right to vote?

22

MR. CLEMENT: Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there was

23

testimony of individuals, I don't have the exact number,

24

and -

25

QUESTION: What - what order of magnitude?

39
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. CLEMENT: I - I think it was anecdotal

2

evidence, and I would say - I mean, to give you a feel for

3

the - the - the sort of order of magnitude, in the state

4

task force reports that Congress authorized, there were 35

5

instances of inaccessible voting places.

6

tell you the breakdown of how many of those involved

7

people refused at the door and how many of those involved

8

simply physical barriers.

9

there was a significant problem in this area.

10

Now, I can't

But I do think it shows that

QUESTION: I don't think it does at all.

11

Inaccessible voting place proves nothing at all.

12

proves that the state did not go out of its way to make it

13

easy for the handicapped to vote, as it should, but as it

14

is not constitutionally required to do.

15

many voting places are inaccessible proves nothing at all.

16

It just

To simply say

MR. CLEMENT: And again, Justice Scalia, I think

17

that when you couple an inaccessible voting place with

18

local officials who are saying, you can't vote today, we

19

don't have any facilities for you, that does violate the

20

Constitution.

21

QUESTION: They're not saying you can't vote,

22

they're saying we don't have facilities for you to get to

23

the voting place.

24
25

MR. CLEMENT: I - I guess I fail to understand
the difference in that in a practical way.

40
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION: I do too.

2

MR. CLEMENT: And I think this Court has said on

3

a number of occasions, in areas of fundamental rights, it

4

is simply not true that only intentional discrimination of

5

the kind you have in mind would violate the Constitution.

6

In the access to court context, in particular, this

7

Court's decision in M.L.B against S.L.J. suggests that in

8

many instances in order to avoid unconstitutional

9

discrimination, the courts have to waive filing fees of

10

indigent defendants or indigent individuals trying to

11

provide their constitutional right.

12

If that's true in areas of fundamental rights,

13

it's not clear why - why state officials don't have some

14

obligations under the Constitution itself to make

15

accommodations for individuals with disabilities.

16

QUESTION: I'm not under - I really don't

17

understand one - one argument that's going on.

18

know why one violation wouldn't be enough to justify

19

congressional action.

20

triggers a legislative response.

21

example be enough?

22

I don't

It often is that one - one incident
Why wouldn't one - one

MR. CLEMENT: Justice Stevens, I think one

23

example might be enough, especially when coupled by other

24

evidence in the record that is reinforcing and suggestive

25

of the problem, especially when coupled with judicial

41
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

decisions that we provide in appendix A of our brief.

2

you put all that evidence together, it's clear that

3

Congress was reacting to a real problem in this context.

4

If

QUESTION: And solve that problem by requiring

5

access to - to state-owned hockey rinks or any state-

6

owned buildings, whether it's a courthouse or anything

7

else.

8

all Congress was directing this legislation at was - was

9

the problem of people getting to the voting place or the

I mean, you're - you're talking about it as though

10

problem of people getting to - to courthouses.

11

how the legislation reads.

12

by the state, hockey rinks, whatever.

13

That's not

It's all public facilities run

MR. CLEMENT: That's true, Justice Scalia.

And

14

let me say two things in response.

15

Congress was entitled, once it found a problem in areas of

16

fundamental rights, to say that it's permissible

17

prophylaxis to - to provide a remedy for a broader array

18

of government services.

First of all, I think

19

QUESTION: Well, there - do -

20

QUESTION: Where there are no conceivable

21
22

constitutional rights involved.
MR. CLEMENT: Well, if I could respond to that, I

23

don't think it's that there's no conceivable

24

constitutional rights involved.

25

implicate fundamental rights, this Court itself has found

Even in areas that don't

42
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

a constitutional violation in the disability context in a

2

case like Cleburne.

3

states are engaging in unconstitutional discrimination in

4

areas implicating fundamental rights, that may lead to an

5

inference that they're simply not turning off the switch

6

when they get into other areas.

7

And I think if Congress finds that

QUESTION: Well, would it - would it be a

8

violation - a constitutional violation to refuse to afford

9

special access to a hockey rink?

10

MR. CLEMENT: I - I don't think standing alone,

11

Mr. Chief Justice, it would, and I think I would defend

12

that in part as part of the permissible prophylaxis of the

13

statute.

If I could say -

14

QUESTION: This is what I'd like to get at.

15

I have the impression from your brief that you were

16

suggesting that we could just address the fundamental

17

rights aspect of this case and forget about the rest, but

18

you seem to be saying now that we should consider the

19

whole thing and consider it all valid as a prophylaxis

20

proposition.

I -

Which is it -

21

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I guess -

22

QUESTION: - that you're proposing?

23

MR. CLEMENT: In fairness, Justice O'Connor, it's

24

both.

25

the statute as a whole, but I also think it would be fair

I mean, I'm here defending the constitutionality of

43
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

for this Court to follow the practice that I think was

2

suggested in a case it decided called United States

3

against Raines, and focus in on the aspect of the statute

4

that is constitutional, that is valid, and that would be

5

fundamental rights.

6

QUESTION: Well, we haven't really done that in

7

other cases of this type, of the sovereign immunity of the

8

states, have we?

9

MR. CLEMENT: You have not, Justice O'Connor.

10

QUESTION: No.

11

MR. CLEMENT: And we pointed that out, and I

12

think there is some tension between the proportionality

13

and congruence test in this as-applied mode of analysis.

14

But I do think the Raines case points out -

15
16

QUESTION: It was decided maybe 50 years ago,
before any of our more recent cases.

17

MR. CLEMENT: I think that's fair, Mr. Chief

18

Justice.

19

that there's nothing inherently inconsistent between

20

analyzing a section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment or

21

section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment piece of

22

legislation, an as-applied analysis.

23

an important relationship between this Court and Raines,

24

because in Raines, this Court in a sense identified a

25

fault line in a statute that was broadly applicable.

I simply point to Raines because Raines shows

And I think there's

It

44
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

applied both to state actors and private individuals.

2

in a case in which it applied to state actors, they said,

3

we may have some concerns about whether it can validly

4

apply to private actors, but we're going to uphold the

5

statute as applied to state actors.

6

And

And in the same way, I think if this Court

7

thinks that the statute is constitutional as applied to

8

fundamental rights, but has concerns in its applications

9

to non-fundamental rights, that it could, in effect,

10

decide the case along the same lines.

11

narrowest ground this Court could decide the case on would

12

be to simply focus on access to the courts.

13

And, of course, the

QUESTION: Suppose the state is building a new

14

stadium, a new hockey rink.

15

obligation to make it accessible to the handicapped?

16

Does it have a constitutional

MR. CLEMENT: I'm not sure that it does, Justice

17

Kennedy.

18

non-fundamental right and ask the question of whether or

19

not that standing alone violates the Constitution -

20

I think that if you isolate the example of the

QUESTION: So - so the Government - the

21

Government's position is citizens don't have some rights

22

of access to public facilities as a matter of the

23

Constitution?

24
25

MR. CLEMENT: I think they have - they might have
some access under the Constitution and some right.

I'm

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

not sure though that I'd be able to make an argument that

2

that constitutional right is protected by something more

3

than that rational basis review.

I think that -

4

QUESTION: You're - you're saying that if the

5

only public facility without a ramp was a hockey rink,

6

you'd have a tough row to hoe, but if every public

7

facility, courthouses, schools, et cetera, have no ramps,

8

then you've got a broader context and you've got a

9

different argument?

10

MR. CLEMENT: That's exactly right, Justice

11

Souter.

12

in mind is that -

And one other thing I think that's worth bearing

13
14

QUESTION: And what is - what is the
constitutional right?

15
16
17

Freedom of movement?

MR. CLEMENT: In - in - in the hockey ring
context?
QUESTION: What is the - what is the basis for

18

the constitutional right that you accepted in your

19

response to your question - in response to Justice

20

Souter's question?

21

MR. CLEMENT: Well, I think it would depend on

22

the facility in particular.

23

- in - in trying to get access to a court, it would be

24

access to the courts.

25

polling place, it would be the right to vote.

I think in the access to the

In trying to get access to a

46
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

thing I'd like to emphasize though is that the - that

2

Title II -

3

QUESTION: There's - there's no - there's no

4

greater right to freedom of movement or general - on the

5

part of citizens, freedom of access to all governmental

6

facilities?

7
8

MR. CLEMENT: I - I'm not sure that - that this
Court has said that yet.

9
10

If it's interested in -

QUESTION: I'm asking your position whether or
not in your view there is such a right.

11

MR. CLEMENT: It's certainly not one that this

12

Court has ever articulated, and - and - what I would say

13

though is that -

14
15
16

QUESTION: So you don't have a position on the
point?
MR. CLEMENT: I have - it's not - it's not a

17

matter I've really given any thought, Justice Kennedy.

18

apologize for that.

19

emphasize is that Title II does not just give an access to

20

buildings, it doesn't give an access to hockey rinks.

21

gives an access to programs, services, and activities, and

22

in many cases, it's going to be the same municipal

23

building that has the courthouse in it as well as other

24

non-fundamental rights, and that's exactly a good

25

illustration of why Title II is appropriate prophylaxis,

I

I think the one thing I would like to

It

47
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

because by making the municipal building accessible, even

2

for something like a kiddie concert that might not

3

implicate fundamental rights, you're also making the

4

courtroom in the same building accessible to individuals

5

who have a constitutional right to access to that

6

building.

7

One other point I'd like to make is with respect

8

to the damages remedy, which is precisely what seems to be

9

the gravamen of the concern of the state here.

As Justice

10

O'Connor pointed out, this is not a situation like other

11

cases, where, if the Court strikes this down as

12

inappropriate section 5 legislation, there's going to be

13

lots of other remedies.

14

people are raising constitutional challenges to the

15

Commerce Clause legislation.

16

The state provides none and

The damages remedy that's particularly provided

17

in Title II of the ADA is provided by double cross-

18

reference.

19

under the Rehabilitation Act, which in turn incorporates

20

the remedies available under Title VI.

21

entirely judge-made, and as the Thornburgh amicus briefs

22

points out, to the extent that those remedies are the

23

gravamen of the constitutional concern, their judge-made

24

origins gives this Court unique flexibility to interpret

25

the compensatory damages remedy in a way that renders the

Title II incorporates the remedies available

Those remedies are

statute as a whole constitutional.
Broadly speaking, Congress, in passing this

3

statute, found a real problem with the individuals and the

4

entities that are responsible for protecting the civil

5

rights of everyone, denying the rights of individuals with

6

disabilities.

7

of compensatory damages.

8

an appropriate response, but it would be very sad if that

9

one element of the statute was used to bring down the

One element of its solution was the element
Those compensatory damages are

10

entirety of Title II, given that it remains vitally

11

necessary to make the promise of the Fourteenth Amendment

12

a reality for individuals with disabilities.

13
14
15

QUESTION: Is there a reason why there's a damage
remedy in Title II and not in Title III?
MR. CLEMENT: I think there is, Justice Ginsburg.

16

I think that one thing, I think, is that Congress - the

17

difference in remedies between Title II and Title III

18

reflects two things.

19

that unconstitutional action by a state is worse than

20

unconstitutional action by a private entity.

One, it reflects a judgment that -

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

briefly, the type of discrimination Congress was referring

2

to in the statement of findings of - and purpose of the

3

act itself is made clear if the Court examines the fifth

4

finding, which - which tells us what sort - what - what

5

concept of discrimination was in Congress' mind when they

6

used the term throughout those findings.

7

about not just outright intentional exclusion, but it

8

talks about discriminatory effects of architectural,

9

transportation, and communication barriers.

And it talks

It talks

10

about overprotective rules and policies and their effects.

11

It talks about failures to make modifications to existing

12

facilities and practices, and exclusionary standards that

13

screen people out, in other words, an another disparate

14

impact sort of conception of discrimination.

15

And I think for that reason one can reliably

16

conclude that - that - that Congress was not using

17

discrimination in the sense of completely arbitrary and

18

irrational discrimination of the sort that's prohibited by

19

section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to

20

disabled persons, but rather, in the findings and purpose,

21

Congress makes clear that it is addressing a very real

22

social problem, one that needs addressing, but one that

23

does not arise to the level of a - a widespread pattern of

24

constitutional violations on the part of the state.

25

QUESTION: But it begins section 5 by saying,

50
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

individuals with disabilities continually encounter

2

various forms of discrimination, including outright

3

intentional exclusion.

4

it all.

So it seems to want to deal with

5

MR. MOORE: Right, but out - of course, outright

6

intentional exclusion is not necessarily unconstitutional

7

either if it is rationally based, with respect to disabled

8

persons.

10

So one - the use of the term discrimination QUESTION: What - what's your authority for that

proposition?

MR. MOORE: The City of Cleburne case, Your

14
