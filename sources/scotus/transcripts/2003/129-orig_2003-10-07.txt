ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW H. BAIDA

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

10

MR. BAIDA:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
There are two reasons why the State of Maryland

11

has the authority to regulate Virginia and its citizens

12

when they seek to place structures in and withdraw water

13

from the Potomac River.

14

First, as confirmed by the Black-Jenkins Award

15

of 1877 and this Court's decision in Morris v. United

16

States, the State of Maryland is and has been the owner of

17

the Potomac River since 1632, and Maryland has never --

18

QUESTION:

Mr. Baida, before you get into your

19

argument, can I just ask you a preliminary question?

20

made the mistake of reading the Master's report before I

21

read the briefs.

22

the entire river issue in there.

23

longer making that point?

I

There's an awful lot of discussion of
Is that -- you're no

24

MR. BAIDA:

25

Maryland is and has been the owner of the river,

Correct, we are not.

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and it has never relinquished the sovereign authority that

2

its title to the river gives it to regulate what takes

3

place on and over the bed.

4

And the second reason --

5

QUESTION:

Do you think the compact covers

6

withdrawals of water by Virginia?

7

directly cover that at all?

8
9

MR. BAIDA:

I mean, does it

It's not the privilege of making and

carrying out orders, Justice O'Connor, although that

10

privilege would seem to apply to building something into

11

the river to exercise a riparian right, and there is a

12

riparian right to withdraw water.

13

QUESTION:

Well, do you -- do you take the

14

position that Maryland could reject every effort by

15

Virginia to withdraw water from the river?

16
17

MR. BAIDA:

QUESTION:

19

MR. BAIDA:

21
22

We -- we have

never taken that position.

18

20

No, Justice O'Connor.

What is your position then?
That Virginia has riparian rights

with respect to the Potomac River.
QUESTION:

Which includes the right to use some

of the water.

23

MR. BAIDA:

24

QUESTION:

25

MR. BAIDA:

Correct.
And take it out of the river.
Correct.

Subject to a standard of

reasonableness, Justice O'Connor.
QUESTION:

Is that reasonableness in part

assessed by the fact that Maryland is a sovereign?

MR. BAIDA:

It's --

QUESTION:

Pardon me.

15
16

Only with Maryland's

That Virginia is a

sovereign?
MR. BAIDA:

No.

It's assessed by the fact that

17

Maryland owns the river, but that Virginia, as -- as a

18

riparian owner, has rights with respect to the river that

19

Maryland must be reasonable with respect to which in its

20

regulations.

QUESTION:

rights are no greater than any private landowner?

MR. BAIDA:

QUESTION:

25

Virginia rights are -- Virginia

That's precisely correct.
Even -- even assuming that's true, I

-- I thought a right is a right.

right to something.

down.

It doesn't mean somebody can turn it

MR. BAIDA:

QUESTION:

5

to take the water.

And -- and -And riparian rights include the right

That's clear.

6

MR. BAIDA:

7

QUESTION:

And -And that's the right to take water,

8

not -- not the right to come and beg Maryland to take

9

water.

10

MR. BAIDA:

The river, Justice Scalia, is

11

entirely within the State of Maryland, and that is

12

undisputed from the -- the language of the Maryland

13

charter back from 1632.

14

QUESTION:

The entire river is in Maryland.

But the compact reserves to the State

15

of Virginia and its citizens riparian rights.

16

rights include, as I think they do, the right to take

17

water, it seems to me that aspect of the case is -- is

18

quite easy to decide.

19

MR. BAIDA:

If riparian

Maryland's ownership of the Potomac

20

gives it to right -- gives it the right to regulate what

21

takes place on and over the bed.

22

rights, but as this Court has recognized, those riparian

23

rights have always been subject to government regulation.

24
25

QUESTION:

There are riparian

I'm mixed up.

I'm sorry.

Maybe -- I

didn't think the case was basically about taking water out

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

of the river.

I thought it was about building something

2

for the purpose of taking water out.

3

MR. BAIDA:

4

QUESTION:

There -Is -- is it actually that you're

5

saying -- I may have misread this and so is it actually --

6

you're saying if -- if somebody -- if the Governor of

7

Virginia goes to the river with a bucket and takes water,

8

a little bit of water, to wash some pans that he has, that

9

they have to get Maryland's permission?

10

taking the water out of the river?

11

something, or both?

12

MR. BAIDA:

13

QUESTION:

Is it about

Is it about building

It's about both.
All right.

So now you're just

14

addressing the problem of taking water out of the river.

15

So can a person who lives next to a river under the common

16

law from 1302 or whatever -- now, can he go to the river

17

and just take some water when he's thirsty?

18

MR. BAIDA:

19

QUESTION:

Yes.
Yes.

All right.

So Virginia is just

20

taking water when they happen to have a lot of people who

21

are thirsty.

22

(Laughter.)

23

QUESTION:

So what's the -- what's the special

24

thing about the water?

25

intake system.

I thought it was building a water

you're thirsty.

Then would you have an objection?

to build into the Potomac which the compact --

3
4

It's -- it's about both.

QUESTION:

There are too many thirsty people is

what your objection is.

10

MR. BAIDA:

Right?

The -- the objection is simply that

11

Maryland has the right to regulate what takes place in its

12

territory, and what takes place --

13

QUESTION:

It doesn't.

What they do is they --

14

they build a -- a hole which fills up with the water from

15

the Potomac and that hole, which happens to be in

16

Virginia, is filled up with water and they drink it.

17

is there any objection?

18
19
20

MR. BAIDA:

Now,

They haven't built a thing.

I think that's a different question.

That's -QUESTION:

No.

I'm asking you, are you

21

objecting to the building or are you objecting separately

22

-- because I hadn't focused on that -- to just taking

23

water without building anything?

24
25

MR. BAIDA:

If they're taking -- if they are --

the low-water mark on the Virginia side --

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

No.

They have nothing built over

2

there.

What happens is water comes up out of the Potomac

3

into Virginia and they drink it.

4

MR. BAIDA:

But I'm trying to understand the

5

nature of your question, Justice Breyer.

6

a hole, are they building the hole in Virginia?

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. BAIDA:

9

When they build

In Virginia.
So they're building a trench in

Virginia.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. BAIDA:

Yes, that's right.
Maryland may have some objections to

12

that at some future point in time, but that's activity

13

that's taking place in Virginia.

14
15

QUESTION:

Yes.

That's what I thought the case

was about.

16

QUESTION:

Unless the trench creates a new low-

17

water mark for the Potomac.

18

Maryland's argument would be, that when you make an inlet

19

into Virginia, that's -- that's the low-water mark of the

20

Potomac.

21
22
23

MR. BAIDA:

I mean, I think that's what

Well, that may -- that -- I don't

know whether that would actually change the -QUESTION:

I didn't want to get it mixed up.

24

All I wanted to do is I focused on this case as a matter

25

of building something.

I didn't focus on it as a matter

And I'm -- and that's -- that was my

Now, maybe just forget my problem.

QUESTION:

Maybe I'm

So skip --

Let -- let me ask you this.

There's

5

a Potomac River Flow Allocation Agreement of 1978.

6

it deal with the right of Virginia to use water or take it

7

out?

MR. BAIDA:

Does

That imposes restrictions on the

three major users of the Potomac River, the Washington

10

Aqueduct, the Army Corps of Engineers, the -- the Fairfax

11

County Water Authority and the Washington Sanitary --

12

Suburban Sanitary Commission, and imposes limitations on

13

the amount of water that they can take --

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. BAIDA:

QUESTION:

17
18

On the amount, but it acknowledges --- in periods of low flow.
-- that water can and will be removed

by Fairfax County?
MR. BAIDA:

Subject to a permitting system that

19

was in place at the time and still is in place.

20

only permitting system that's ever been in place with

21

respect to the Potomac River has been the permitting

22

system established by the State of Maryland.

23

And the

And I think I'd like to just go back to the

24

initial point I tried to make at the beginning, which is

25

why Maryland has the right to do what it's doing here.

9

Before you do that, can I ask a
How is Maryland, if it is, adversely
Is there any

So even though our people are

Is there any adverse impact on Maryland or its

MR. BAIDA:

Well, the Maryland administrative

10

and judicial review proceedings answered that question

11

"no."

12

But the reason why Maryland took the -- the

13

action that it did was because Fairfax County already had

14

an existing waterway intake pipe in the -- in the river.

15

They wanted to build another intake pipe 725 feet into the

16

river, and the edge of it would be 30 inches above water

17

with a 5-foot walkway.

18

see if there are less intrusive alternatives that are

19

available.

20

Maryland took the position let's

Virginia wanted to do this.

Fairfax County

21

wanted to do this because it was concerned about the

22

effect of the -- the water on the shoreline which is where

23

the existing intake pipe was and wanted to get cleaner

24

water from the -- from the middle of the river.

Maryland took the view, well, let's see if there are less

QUESTION:

Why?

QUESTION:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Because -- because there wasn't

think you're saying Maryland had no such objection.

10

MR. BAIDA:

That's --

Another is our people are

Maryland had no objection to the

11

Fairfax County Water Authority withdrawing water.

12

Maryland's objection was to minimize the impact on the

13

Potomac River.

QUESTION:

I

What authority did you have to

15

minimize the impact?

16

the State and its citizens riparian rights, including the

17

right to build structures into the river so long as they

18

do not impede navigation.

19

-- that this new structure would impede navigation of the

20

river?

21

isn't it?

The compact between the States gives

MR. BAIDA:

Well, there was -- that was part of

it because it -- it was in the scenic portion of the

QUESTION:

Well, you should have reserved that

5

right in the -- in the compact.

6

said, you know, provided it does not impede navigation or

7

be ugly.

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. BAIDA:

The compact could have

What the -- what the compact does,

10

Justice Scalia, is it provides that the Potomac River

11

could be used as a common highway by the citizens of both

12

States, and it also secures important private property

13

rights.

14

of both States.

15

Private property rights, again for the citizens

QUESTION:

All right.

Let -- if I may, let me

interrupt you there.

Do you concede that the State has

21

about citizens.

MR. BAIDA:

That's exactly what this Court has

1

said in --

2
3

QUESTION:

Well, is that -- I mean, is that a

premise of your argument?

4

MR. BAIDA:

5

QUESTION:

Yes.
Do you -- do you also deny that the

6

State with respect to withdrawal of water for its citizens

7

that the -- do you deny that the State stands in the shoes

8

of its citizens?

9

MR. BAIDA:

The -- the State -- the Commonwealth

10

of Virginia brought this action on behalf of its citizens

11

to seek --

12
13

QUESTION:

No.

I realize that, but are you

denying that it may properly do that?

14

MR. BAIDA:

15

QUESTION:

No.

No, we are not.

So, in effect, are you saying the

16

State -- it -- it is just as though the State had express

17

rights under article VII because in making the claim that

18

it's making, it stands in the shoes of its citizens, and

19

its citizens do have rights.

20

concede that?

21
22
23

MR. BAIDA:

Yes.

Is -- is that -- do you

The -- we've never denied that

the -QUESTION:

Then it's irrelevant that the -- that

24

article VII speaks only of citizens and not of the State.

25

Is that correct?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. BAIDA:

No, it's not irrelevant, Justice --

2

QUESTION:

Then what -- what difference does it

MR. BAIDA:

Because all that the compact does,

3

make?

4
5

it secures -- it -- it makes a -- there is -- the compact

6

drafters recognized the difference between jurisdiction

7

and sovereignty and private property rights, and when they

8

wanted to, they knew exactly how to go about addressing

9

issues of sovereignty.

10

QUESTION:

Now, one of my questions in this case

11

is this.

12

questions this way based on article VII or paragraph --

13

clause VII of -- of the compact.

14

interpret that too according to the Black-Jenkins Award,

15

particularly paragraph 4 at page C-4 of -- of the -- of

16

the Special Master's appendices?

17

says Virginia -- not citizens.

18

riparian rights, and both of those two phrases are not

19

used in the compact.

20

think is used in the compact, and the compact talks about

21

citizens.

22

You've answered Justice Souter and he posed his

But must we not

That uses the -- that

That says Virginia has

The phrase, riparian rights, I don't

But the Black-Jenkins Award goes -- it seems to

23

me, interprets authoritatively -- and you correct me if

24

I'm wrong -- what the compact means.

25

-- at least I think it's a permissible reading -- to say

And I read the Black

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

that Virginia -- and we'll argue about as a sovereign.

2

That -- that's -- that's a phrase I add -- has riparian

3

rights.

4

VII, but on part 4 of the Black-Jenkins Award, do we not?

5

So we really do have to focus not just on section

MR. BAIDA:

Yes.

And we -- Maryland's view is

6

that that part of the award confirms Maryland's rights

7

over the river.

8

more fully.

And I'd like to explain this a little bit

9

What the Black-Jenkins arbitrators did was they

10

rejected Virginia's claim to any right in the soil -- any

11

right in the soil -- beyond the water mark, any right to

12

any of the islands in the river, and any right to any part

13

of the bed of the river.

14

QUESTION:

Now --

Yes, but it said, as has been pointed

15

out, that Virginia was given a proprietary right and a

16

privilege to erect any structures necessary to the full

17

enjoyment of Virginia's riparian ownership, which

18

presumably encompasses taking out water.

19

MR. BAIDA:

And the presumption, Justice

20

O'Connor, is overcome by looking at the rest of the award,

21

and what the -- the arbitrators did, they did give

22

Virginia title to the middle of other bodies of water,

23

namely the -- the Tangier Sound, the Pocomoke Sound, and

24

the Pocomoke River.

25

QUESTION:

But they specifically rejected -Yes, but do you deny that Virginia

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

has riparian ownership up to the low-water mark of the

2

Potomac?

3

MR. BAIDA:

The arbitrators said that Virginia

4

has full dominion over this right in the soil up to low-

5

water mark, but beyond that point, Virginia only has a

6

right to use the river.

7

it's not title, it's not sovereignty.

A right of use is not dominion,

8

QUESTION:

But it says --

9

QUESTION:

Why?

But it is a right of use, and

10

that's what you're -- and that's what you're contradicting

11

here.

12

the river.

That's all they want.

13

They're not trying to govern

They just want to use it.

MR. BAIDA:

A right of use, Justice Scalia, is

14

subject to governmental authority and regulation, and

15

that's exactly what this Court said --

16

QUESTION:

Well, but it says here in the Black-

17

Jenkins Award and in the earlier compact, the privilege to

18

erect structures necessary to the full enjoyment of the

19

riparian ownership.

20

out.

21

MR. BAIDA:

That might mean a pipe to take water

This Court has said in, for example,

22

Massachusetts v. New York that Massachusetts' right to use

23

Lake Ontario was still subject to the regulatory authority

24

of New York because New York had title to the bed of Lake

25

Ontario.

17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

QUESTION:

Mr. Baida, can I ask you sort of a

2

basic question?

3

between the right that Virginia has, the riparian rights

4

of Virginia, on the one hand, and the riparian rights of

5

Maryland's citizens who -- who own the property on the

6

Maryland shore of the river?

7

Or what is the difference between the riparian rights of

8

the people on the opposite sides of the river?

9

In your view is there any difference

MR. BAIDA:

Do -- are they equivalent?

The -- Maryland is to treat them

10

identically, and that's set forth clearly in article VII

11

of the compact.

12

QUESTION:

So that either -- on either side of

13

the river, a property owner could stick a pipe in and

14

drain the river.

15

MR. BAIDA:

Not -- not if it has any kind of

16

adverse impact from Maryland's perspective, whether it's

17

in Maryland -- if -- if the City of Rockville wanted to do

18

this, it would encounter presumably exactly the same kind

19

of reaction that Fairfax County initially did.

20

QUESTION:

You say the riparian rights on either

21

side of the river are subject to the paramount authority

22

of the Maryland -- the State of Maryland to -- to govern

23

what happens to the water.

24

MR. BAIDA:

25

QUESTION:

Yes.
And -- and in the exercise of that

authority, could Maryland give a higher priority to the

2

citizens of Rockville than to the citizens of Vienna,

3

Virginia?

4

MR. BAIDA:

No, and this Court said in Yates v.

5

Milwaukee that -- that the riparian right cannot be

6

arbitrarily and capriciously denied.

7

QUESTION:

No.

It's not arbitrary and

8

capricious.

9

there's too much traffic in Virginia.

10

And that --

They make a lot of findings and they said
Virginia would be

better off if it's rural.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. BAIDA:

13

QUESTION:

Well, Your Honor, I think -And -- and what is -- what is the

14

source for your statement that Maryland has to be non-

15

arbitrary?

16

constitutional obligation that one State owes to another?

17

Is this riparian water law or is this some

MR. BAIDA:

I -- I think it's again set forth in

18

Yates v. Milwaukee where the Court said that a State

19

cannot -- or a government -- municipality cannot

20

arbitrarily and capriciously deny someone the exercise of

21

a riparian right.

22

QUESTION:

So in your opinion --

23

QUESTION:

But -- but that's based on -- on --

24
25

that's a statement of riparian law?
MR. BAIDA:

Yes.

I think -- I mean, it's a

3

It is a property right, and it can't be

QUESTION:

So we're talking about -- all we're

talking about is property rights here.

5

about the definition of what a riparian right is.

We're just talking

6

MR. BAIDA:

7

And just so I'm clear, Justice Kennedy, the rule

of law, not administrative hyperbole, is what governed the

overruled, and the permit has since issued.

15

16

we don't like what's happening over there, and -- and

17

then --

Yes.

I mean, it -- there was -- it went through the
Maryland thought it had valid reasons for

And so this

QUESTION:

So your opinion is --

You -- you used the word arbitrary.

20

I didn't.

21

governs Maryland's obligation under your point of -- under

22

your submission to make these determinations.

23

said it has to just be fair among riparian owners because

24

this is what riparian law requires it to do.

25

I just want to know the source of law which

MR. BAIDA:

And you

10

MR. BAIDA:

Oh, but that's just an obligation it

No.

Virginia doesn't have any

And -- and again, it's because

11

of what Maryland gave up in this compact and -- and what

12

the Black-Jenkins Award provided.

13

And again, we have to go back -- and the -- the

14

problem with -- with the Special Master's recommendation

from Maryland's perspective is that he began at the wrong

place in history.

the charter gives Maryland this river, and -- and so the

Maryland does have sovereign authority over it.

He began with the compact.

He should

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

1

But your argument seems to hang on that 1632

2

document indisputably was it, and that everything else

3

flows from there.

4

necessarily so.

5

They finally resolved it in 1877, but it wasn't an

6

inevitable truth that it was 1632 rather than the Virginia

7

grants.

9

The Special Master said, not

They couldn't even resolve it in 1785.

MR. BAIDA:

Justice Ginsburg, the -- the flaw in

the reasoning is that it ignores the plain language of the

charter which this Court said includes the Potomac River

It doesn't

What matters is who had title, and under

basically a deed holder.

But in -- yes, in 1609 Virginia was

King Charles I in 1632 had the right to carve Maryland out

Are you saying the Black-Jenkins

implicit assumption at least of both the 1877 Black-

3

Jenkins Award and the 1785 compact -- the implicit, if not

4

explicit, assumption was that Maryland owned the river?

5

MR. BAIDA:

No.

I think a fair reading of that

6

document -- of -- of the -- the 1785 compact and the 1877

award was that reasonable minds may have differed.

8

the States decided this is how we're going to address

is -- is the rights -- or -- or ownership and stuff.

If I said that, let me retrieve it

immediately because that was not what I meant to say.

that Maryland's title has not changed one iota in almost

QUESTION:

Mr. Baida, maybe I'm missing

2

something here, but I did not understand that the State of

3

Virginia is contesting the ownership of Maryland of the

4

bed of the river.

5

Virginia?

6

right up to the low-water mark on the southern shore of

8

that does not answer the question of whether the riparian

of Virginia requires that -- that they obtain permission

from Maryland before withdrawing water or creating a

12

structure to withdraw water.

I agree, Justice Scalia, but it goes

14

a long way in resolving that question because by

acknowledging that -- that the boundary is not in dispute,

by acknowledging that Maryland does, indeed, have title to

17

this river, Virginia has acknowledged Maryland's

MR. RAPHAEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
The Special Master correctly decided the

regulation issue for two reasons.

23

the compacts in question is plain and unambiguous, and

24

second, for more than 180 years, Maryland never disputed

25

that it was entirely --

First, the language of

1
2

QUESTION:

Does that plain language tell us what

riparian rights are?

3

MR. RAPHAEL:

The plain language of article IV

4

of the Black-Jenkins Award uses the term riparian

5

ownership.

6

QUESTION:

But you said plain language of the

7

compact, and now you're all of a sudden talking about

8

Black-Jenkins.

9

MR. RAPHAEL:

10
11

QUESTION:

It's both.

The compact does not use the word

riparian.

12

MR. RAPHAEL:

13

think that the plain language --

14
15

QUESTION:

That -- That's correct.

But we

So you say it's the plain language of

the compact with the gloss of the Black-Jenkins Award.

16

MR. RAPHAEL:

17

QUESTION:

We think it's both.

What do you make -- and I don't have

18

this in front of me, so maybe I -- I'm missing something.

19

But I thought the Black-Jenkins Award also put a --

20

included a disclaimer that it wasn't, in fact, modifying

21

anything in the 1785 compact.

22

MR. RAPHAEL:

Am I right?

That's -- that's correct because

23

the enabling legislation for the Black-Jenkins Award

24

provided that neither of the States would be deprived of

25

any of the rights or privileges, nor would the citizens be

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

deprived of rights or privileges that they had under the

2

Compact of 1785.

3

QUESTION:

4

Assuming that then, how do we get from the

How -- I'm sorry.

5

language of article VII in the compact that refers to

6

citizens to the language in Black-Jenkins that talks about

7

the States?

8
9

MR. RAPHAEL:

Your Honor, the citizens in

Virginia only had those rights under the compact because

10

Virginia as a sovereign entered into an interstate compact

11

with Maryland.

12

Secondly, Maryland recognized in the enabling

13

legislation that provided for the Black-Jenkins Award that

14

the rights were the rights not only of citizens, but of

15

the States.

16

That language is used in the enabling act.

QUESTION:

So you -- you say that in

17

interpreting the Black-Jenkins Award, Virginia's riparian

18

ownership is -- is defined by its -- in part by its

19

sovereign status?

20

MR. RAPHAEL:

21

QUESTION:

22
23

Yes, that's correct.

So that sovereignty is inherent in

ownership?
MR. RAPHAEL:

I think that's correct.

If -- if

24

you look at the opinion that accompanied the Black-Jenkins

25

Award, the arbitrators said that Virginia had proven her

30
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

use of the Potomac River since her earliest days and that

2

her rights were, therefore, indisputable and that Maryland

3

assented to Virginia's use when she signed the Compact of

4

1785.

5

Now, that compact, Your Honor, was entered into

6

at a time when the boundary was disputed, and regardless

7

of where the boundary was set -- I think Mr. Baida admits

8

this -- it was recognized that that compact did not set

9

the boundary, but each State agreed that wherever the

10

boundary ultimately would be set, the citizens of each

11

State and the States themselves would have certain rights,

12

and those rights included the right to property in the

13

shores, and all advantages and emoluments thereunto

14

belonging, and the privilege of making and carrying out

15

wharfs and other improvements.

16

QUESTION:

Except for the sense of the document,

17

at least of the compact, as I read it, is that the State

18

is treated just like any other owner.

19

MR. RAPHAEL:

I don't think that that's correct,

20

Your Honor, because article --

21

QUESTION:

22

Well, can you point me to

something --

MR. RAPHAEL:

25

Yes.

-- in the compacts or the -- or the

Black-Jenkins Award to the contrary?

1

MR. RAPHAEL:

Well, the Black-Jenkins Award

2

clearly deals with Virginia as a State.

The compact deals

3

with Virginia as a State in article VIII, for example,

4

where it requires that neither State could regulate

5

fishing or navigation without the concurrence of the other

6

State.

7

rights of the citizens.

8

matter in which a State would touch the activities of the

9

citizens of the other State, it said so expressly.

Articles X and XI and XII also deal with the
Wherever the compact involved a

10

And it's inconceivable to think that the -- the

11

drafters of the compact would have agreed that concurrent

12

legislation would be required for fishing and navigation,

13

but Maryland could somehow regulate Virginia's right to

14

build improvements from the shore.

15

that they would have ratified the compact if that had been

16

required.

17

QUESTION:

It's inconceivable

Why -- why is it concurrent for

22

Article seventh says that the -- that the

MR. RAPHAEL:

Your Honor, until 1957, the States

7

had concurrent legislation governing fishing in the

9

VIII of the compact.

In 1957 -- and that was based on article
In 1957, Maryland attempted to

10

abrogate that requirement and to assume unilateral

11

authority over the Potomac River.

12

here.

This Court appointed a special master to hear the

case.

The States resolved their dispute as to the tidal

14

Potomac with the creation of the Potomac River Fisheries

15

Commission, which is a bi-State agency that now regulates

fishing in the -- in the tidal Potomac.

Virginia filed suit

17

As to the non-tidal Potomac, since 1957 each

18

State has had laws on the books that recognize permits

19

issued or licenses issued to citizens of the other State

20

as valid licenses for fishing in the non-tidal Potomac.

23

QUESTION:

What's left of the dispute now?

Is

-- does Virginia now have a permit to withdraw the water?
MR. RAPHAEL:

1
2

QUESTION:

Yes.

Is that all you're arguing

about?

3

MR. RAPHAEL:

No, Your Honor, because we contend

4

that no permit was required in the first instance, and we

5

also challenged that specific permit because the Maryland

6

legislature required that it contain a condition requiring

7

the water authority to put a flow restrictor into the

8

pipeline for the sole purpose, the Maryland legislature

9

said, of allowing Maryland to control growth and

10

development in northern Virginia.

11

authority objected to that subject to the outcome in this

12

case.

So we're -- we're talking now about a

flow restrictor in the pipe?

Would you say that right includes the right to withdraw an

assignments of sovereign powers, abrogation of sovereign

that that helps Maryland in this case.

MR. RAPHAEL:

That's -- that's exactly right.

But the answer to your question, Your Honor, is that there

19

was no need in article VII to address that specific

question because it was -- everybody would have assumed

that each State retained the authority to regulate its own

citizens.

that there is -- that that provision has not been made.

MR. RAPHAEL:

But, Your Honor, it's -- to our

4

thinking it would be inconceivable that George Mason who

-- who negotiated that compact on behalf of Virginia, who

6

opposed the Federal Constitution because it gave Congress

7

too much authority over -- over commerce, that he would

have signed an agreement with the understanding that

Maryland had the authority to decide when and where

Virginia could make use of the river.

Morris v. United States and Marine Railway, and they

21

agreed in 1785 that the bundle of sticks was over here and

22

the two States agreed that regardless of where the

boundary would be set, each State would have equal sticks

matter of sort of looking at history and all, at the time

these documents were negotiated and prepared, I don't

think anyone contemplated the possibility that a diversion

of water from the river would be so great that it might

that Virginia could syphon off enough water to reduce the

goes to the -- goes to whether the boundary is at the

historic low-water mark or at the mean low-water mark.

But you do say that even if it might

not change the boundary of the State, they could withdraw

as much water as they want as long as it doesn't interfere

MR. RAPHAEL:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW H. BAIDA

ON BEHALF OF THE PLAINTIFF

MR. BAIDA:

Prior to this case, Virginia has

never taken the position that it has any authority to take

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

any kind of regulatory action at all with respect to piers

2

and wharfs beyond the water mark.

3

Virginia has done is it has sent hundreds of its citizens

4

to Maryland and it has told its citizens that their

5

construction projects from the Virginia side of the

6

Potomac River fall outside of Virginia's jurisdiction but

7

fall within Maryland's because Maryland owns the bed of

8

the river.

9

putting aside just for the moment any agreements -- it

And in fact, what

That ownership gives Maryland the right,

10

gives Maryland the right to regulate withdrawals of water

11

from Maryland.

12

And so what we're left with at this moment is

13

article VI, the fourth paragraph, of the Black-Jenkins

14

Award, and it says it does give Virginia full dominion

15

over the right in the soil, but Justice Scalia, I would

16

disagree it gives Virginia any sovereign rights to use the

17

river beyond that point because if it gave Virginia the

18

unrestricted right to use the Potomac River beyond that

19

point, that's called quiet title.

20

gets to do what it wants.

21

this Court said in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe that that

22

kind of regulatory action, if unrestricted, is the

23

equivalent of a quiet title action.

24
25

That means Virginia

Maryland can't regulate it, and

The Black-Jenkins arbitrators rejected
Virginia's claim to any title to the middle of the river.
