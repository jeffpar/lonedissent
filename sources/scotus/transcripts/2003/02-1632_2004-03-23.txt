CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: We will hear argument first

this morning in number 02-1632, Ralph Howard Blakely, Junior,

5

versus Washington.

Mr. Fisher.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:

11

The sentencing system at issue here contains exactly

12

the same infirmities that the system -- that this

13

de-validated two years ago, in Ring versus Arizona.

14

defendant's convicted of a felony, Washington law sets a

15

statutory cap to that a sentencing Judge may not exceed unless

16

there are facts present that are not accounted for in the

17

guilty verdict.

18

Once a

These are called aggravating facts.

Yet in Washington, just like Arizona, a Judge makes

19

these findings.

20

Arizona in that the standard of proof is a preponderance of

21

the evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt.

22
23
24

And in Washington, it's even worse than

QUESTION:

But it's still within the statutory

maximum.
MR. FISHER:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, the statutory

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

maximum as Apprendi defines that term, as Apprendi and Ring

2

define that term, is the highest sentence that is allowable

3

based on the facts and the guilty verdict.

4

sentence in this case, is the top end of the standard range,

5

it would be 53 months for Mr. Blakely.

6

Washington law labels an additional cap as what Washington law

7

calls the statutory maximum which is the ultimate exceptional

8

sentence, or the ultimate enhancement that could be put

9

forward.

That -- that

You're correct that

But that is simply a second cap.

10

The question that this Court in Apprendi and Ring

11

asked was what is the maximum sentence to which the defendant

12

can be subjected to, based on the facts in the guilty verdict.

13

And that is the top of the standard range.

14

QUESTION:

Well, I assume that if your position were

15

adopted it would invalidate the Federal sentencing scheme that

16

we have.

17

MR. FISHER:

18

QUESTION:

19

MR. FISHER:

I don't think so, Justice O'Connor.

Why not?
Well, the big difference, the biggest

20

difference between the Federal system and Washington, is the

21

Federal system is a system of court rules.

22

Legislative mandates.

23

the highest penalty authorized by the legislature, or the

24

statutory maximum that is easily applied to this case, because

25

all of the

Not a system of

So when Apprendi and Ring use the term

1

3

QUESTION:

Two wrongs -- two wrongs make a right, I

would say right.
MR. FISHER:

That can sometimes be the case.

4

Because the sentencing system that is at issue here, is fully

5

legislated.

6

However, when it

QUESTION:

I can't see much difference.

Your point

7

is that if the same scheme that Washington has were adopted by

8

courts, it's okay.

9

MR. FISHER:

Well, that may well be the case,

10

Justice O'Connor, I don't think you have to decide the Federal

11

-- that issue in this case.

12

Williams and lots of other cases that if a legislature leaves

13

it up to individual judges to decide what kinds of facts they

14

want to consider in meting out sentences that is fully

15

constitutional.

16

But this Court's clearly held

And as this Court described the Federal guideline

17

scheme is Mistretta, this Court in pages 395 and 396 of that

18

opinion said what we really have is just an aggregation of

19

that same individualized discretion.

20

bit more formal in the Federal scheme.

21

QUESTION:

Just make it a little

We did think a big deal in Mistretta, did

22

we not, about the fact that the sentencing commission is in

23

the judicial branch.

24
25

MR. FISHER:

Absolutely.

holding, Justice Scalia.

That was the crux of the

I realize there was some

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

disagreement on that issue.

2

back to your question, the critical distinction is, if the

3

legislature is content to leave it up to judges, or the

4

judicial branch to decide what factors matter and where lines

5

should be drawn, then Apprendi is not triggered in the same

6

way that it is when a legislature steps in and says -- as it

7

has done in this case.

8

to go above a certain threshold unless it finds additional

9

facts.

10

However, Justice O'Connor, to get

We are not prepared to allow a court

Unless additional facts are present.
QUESTION:

But if the guarantee of jury trial for a

11

finding of fact in Apprendi, it is to be logical, why should

12

it make any difference whether the court or the legislature

13

sets out the scheme?

14

MR. FISHER:

Well, Mr. Chief Justice, there are two

15

parts of Apprendi, one is -- footnote 16 of Apprendi, this

16

Court talked about the democratic constraints that operate on

17

legislatures vis-a-vis courts.

18

in and says we're not prepared to let a sentence go above a

19

certain level unless certain facts are present, that's a very

20

different system, than when a legislature steps in and says we

21

will let courts operate however they like underneath a certain

22

-- underneath a certain system.

23

QUESTION:

And when a legislature steps

So are you here to say if Washington

24

State's legislature said that for a burglary conviction that a

25

judge can sentence anywhere from 10 to 20 years.

Based on the

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1
2
3
4

judge's discretion, that's perfectly okay.
MR. FISHER:

Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe that

that's what the holding in Apprendi and Ring would dictate.
QUESTION:

What about the other half.

You talked

5

about one half of Apprendi, what about the other half.

6

mean, the other half in effect says, when you allow fact

7

finding by judges to convert crime A into more serious crime

8

B, you're making an end run around the right to jury trial,

9

isn't the same thing going on here?

10

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that is what's happening

11

in this case, Justice Souter.

12

takes us back to Apprendi

13

QUESTION:

I

And what happens is, and it

Why isn't the same -- I mean, no matter

14

whether it's happening under the -- under the immediate

15

authorization of legislation setting up the guidelines or

16

legislation that sets up, or that authorizes a component of

17

judiciary set guidelines, isn't the same thing going on?

18

MR. FISHER:

Well, from the defendant's point of

19

view you might say that it is, but there is a difference in

20

that Apprendi talks -- the baseline of Apprendi is deciding

21

what are elements.

22

and the definition of a crime has to flow from a legislative

23

function, a legislature or the person who makes the laws sets

24

out what facts matter, or what facts don't matter.

25

And elements -- the wellspring of elements

So it's absolutely the case of course that Winship

7
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and the Sixth Amendment apply to courts just as much as they

2

apply to legislatures, however we need a baseline for where

3

those rights kick in, and I think that the proper baseline, or

4

a proper baseline would be the facts that the legislative body

5

or the lawmaker has set out that matter for punishment.

6

QUESTION:

I guess the tough question is whether the

7

sentencing guidelines, or rather the Sixth Amendment are

8

unconstitutional, right?

9
10
11

MR. FISHER:

I think the Sixth Amendment is

constitutional, Justice
QUESTION:

I just wonder what is the statute in the

12

guidelines case, says to the judge, Judge, you must impose a

13

sentence that the commission has written unless you depart for

14

certain reasons.

15

the sentence, da, da, da.

16

things, special aggravating circumstances, for example.

17

The Washington statute says, you must impose
Unless and it has similar kinds of

In neither case can you go beyond the outer limit in

18

the one case, 25 years, or 10 years in the other case, the

19

statutory max in the statute.

20

MR. FISHER:

What again is the difference?

The difference is, in the Washington

21

scheme the legislature has in effect -- the legislature has

22

caught it by the sentencing grid.

23

itself, all of the standard sentencing ranges.

24
25

The legislature has enacted

Whereas in the Federal scheme, the legislature, or
the Congress has left it up to courts to decide where the

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

standard sentencing ranges ought to fall, so long as they're

2

under an open

3

QUESTION:

You know the reason -- the difference is

4

that in sentence -- the Federal statute says, Judge, you must

5

apply the grid of sentence.

6

must apply the word eight years, unless three years, unless -­

7

in the other words, apply what the commission said.

8

the difference, right?

9
10

MR. FISHER:
QUESTION:

And in Washington it says you

That's

I'm not sure I

In the Washington statute, it says,

11

Judge, if you have an ordinary case, you must sentence the

12

person to three years.

13

more than 10.

14

an ordinary case, you must apply the sentence, now the

15

commission fills in that blank.

16

to eight years.

17

But if it's not ordinary go to 10, no

In a Federal case, it says, Judge, if you have

But if it's not ordinary, go

So the blank is filled by the commission in one

18

case, by the legislature in the other.

19

Why does that make a difference constitutionally?

20

MR. FISHER:

The first stage blank.

The reason it makes a difference is

21

because in the Washington system, in the state system the

22

legislature has, as a policy choice with democratic

23

constraints operating upon it, selected a maximum that it's

24

not prepared to let judges go above.

25

discretion of judges.

So it's constraining the

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

In the Federal system, Congress is -- you're right,

2

Congress is telling judges, we want you to come up with rules

3

and follow them.

4

judicial branch, to come up with what the rules are.

5

only significant difference that comes out of the briefing,

6

between this case and the Ring Case, is that -- is the state

7

points to the fact that unlike Ring, where you had 10

8

aggravating factors, here Washington sets out a general

9

standard, and leaves -- and says 11 -- 11 suggested

But it's leaving it up to the judges, the
So the

10

aggravators, but it calls those aggravators illustrative

11

rather than exclusive.

12

proper application of Apprendi that distinction makes no

13

difference.

14

QUESTION:

However, we believe that under a

You can -- isn't the one -- isn't that

15

Washington prescription, that we talked about in the Williams

16

case, leaving it almost completely up to the judge?

17

MR. FISHER:

It's not, Mr. Chief Justice.

You are

18

correct but if they did leave it completely up to the judge

19

that would be the Williams case, it would be a very different

20

case than this one.

21

is written, and the way it's been interpreted by the

22

Washington courts is that the eleven factors are illustrative,

23

and so therefore if a court is going to depart on a factor

24

that is not one of them on the list, it has to be analogous,

25

or fairly closely tied into the factors that are on the list.

However, the way that the Washington law

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

So in the Ammons case for example which is one of

2

the first Washington State Supreme Court cases interpreting

3

their guideline system.

4

purpose of this system was to take away the unfettered

5

discretion that we had in the past and to significantly

6

constrain it.

7

QUESTION:

They said very bluntly that the whole

So if you prevail the jury gets the list

8

of -- of all the 11 factors, plus whatever else the judge

9

thinks might come up?

10

them for that as well?

11

MR. FISHER:

During the trial do you have to prepare

Well, in a typical system, Justice

12

Kennedy, there are one, two, maybe three aggra

13

aggravating factors.

14

during the trial the prosecutor would charge an aggravated

15

crime, and simply -- just like the deadly weapon in this case,

16

they would have charged deliberate cruelty.

17

would instruct the jury on what deliberate cruelty means.

18

QUESTION:

proposed

So what we'd be proposing is that yes,

And the judge

Most -- most of these cases like this one

19

come up on pleas.

They don't -- they were trials, yes.

And

20

the jury would be instructed, but how would -- how would it

21

affect the typical case, where there's a plea?

22

of your argument that if you enter a plea you're home free,

23

from any enhancement, there's been no jury.

24

plea before the judge, and just as in here the prosecutor says

25

I'm going to recommend the top of the guidelines 29 to 53

Is the bottom

You entered a

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

months.

2

says I think you deserve more, is the terminal point of your

3

argument that with a guilty plea, for the system to be

4

constitutional, no jury now, just a judge, there can't be any

5

enhancement.

6

And you say fine I'll plead to that, and the Judge

MR. FISHER:

So long as the guilty plea does not

7

include any stipulation to an aggravating fact, yes, the top

8

would be the standard range.

9
10
11

QUESTION:

However

So the defendant would have to say, yeah,

I stipulate to 31 more.
MR. FISHER:

Otherwise it couldn't be given.

Well, I'm not sure it would work

12

exactly that way, Justice O'Connor.

13

would be that the defendant in this case

14

QUESTION:

15

MR. FISHER:

I think what would work

Justice Ginsburg, yeah.
I'm sorry.

Justice Ginsburg, is that

16

in this case for example the defendant would have pled guilty.

17

And he could have said I agree that I committed deliberate

18

cruelty in this case, which would raise the cap and the judge

19

would be able to do a sentence anywhere under that cap.

20

QUESTION:

Well, if he didn't agree to that, there

21

wouldn't be a plea.

22

claiming an aggravator here and I want the range increased

23

that would have to be part of that stipulation, the deliberate

24

cruelty would have to be part of the plea agreement.

25

wasn't, there wouldn't be a plea.

I mean, if the prosecutor says, look, I'm

If it

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. FISHER:

2

QUESTION:

Absolutely, Justice Souter.

Do judges typically impose the higher

3

penalty where there's been a plea.

4

hard to do that when you haven't had a trial.

5

judge have in front of him to, you know, to enable him to make

6

the fact finding that justifies the aggravator?

7

MR. FISHER:

It seems to me it's pretty
What does the

Well, the way it works right now in

8

Washington, is that if the defendant enters a plea, there's a

9

presentence report that goes to the judge.

The judge can

10

also, as the judge should in this case, have the victim

11

testify for example.

12

However, Washington law specifically provides that

13

if the judge wants to impose an exceptional sentence, based on

14

aggravating facts, and the defendant disputes the presence of

15

those facts, Washington law already provides in Section 370,

16

the Judge has to hold a hearing.

17

judge -- I'm sorry.

18

QUESTION:

And that's exactly what the

Are you saying that that hearing -- you'd

19

have to convene a jury specially -- in this case it was a

20

guilty plea, and the prosecutor was satisfied with 49, 53

21

months.

22

when the prosecutor is willing to make that deal, doesn't want

23

the 30 extra months, but the judge wants it, once the guilty

24

plea is made, then can the judge say, never mind, prosecutor,

25

I don't like that bargain.

The judge said I'm not satisfied.

Is it your view

13
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And this -- do you have to convene a jury specially

2

then, just this jury specially to hear the evidence on whether

3

there should be -- or the

4

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Ginsburg, certainly my

5

case doesn't stand or fall on the fact that the judge is the

6

one that did this hearing.

7

circumstance it seems a sensible result that if the prosecutor

8

isn't asking for an aggravated factor and nobody's contesting

9

it, then the judge ought to either be bound by the deal, or

10

the judge in the interest of justice, as he always has, can

11

say I don't think this is a fair plea.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. FISHER:

14

QUESTION:

However, I think that in that

That's right, he can turn down the deal.
Yeah.

I mean, and does he only get the

15

presentence report after the plea is accepted?

16

it before the plea is accepted?

17

MR. FISHER:

18

QUESTION:

Or does he get

I think it varies, Justice Scalia.

Well, so long as he has it in front of

19

him, before he rules on the plea, he can effectively achieve

20

what Justice Ginsburg is concerned about by simply refusing to

21

accept the plea, unless the defendant is willing to confess to

22

one of the aggravating factors.

23

MR. FISHER:

24

QUESTION:

25

That's right, Justice Scalia.

So this moves the entire system.

I mean

I am now -- the light has dawned slightly -- the reason I

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

guess, I'd like your view, but the defense thought like

2

Apprendi and pursues these cases because 95 percent of the

3

people in prison are not there pursuant to a jury trial.

4

Rather they're there because of plea bargaining.

5

work in the plea bargaining context, though it won't work at

6

all in the trial context.

7

And it will

You'd have to go and argue, my client was in

8

Chicago, but by the way I'd like to point out that he only hit

9

the person lightly not heavily as the -- so that wouldn't work

10

at all.

But you don't mind because your job everyday is plea

11

bargaining.

12

right?

13

If I'm right about that, I want to know if I am

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that you're right that

14

Apprendi works in plea bargaining, but with all due respect

15

I'm not sure that I accept that doesn't work in

QUESTION:

Okay.

Then let's go to the trial.

defend yourself against all those aggravators.

MR. FISHER:

All that's charged.

You want to

Now, how do you

Well, Justice Breyer, the same thing

23

happens for example when there's a lesser included offense in

24

the case.

25

QUESTION:

Of course it does, but they're very

15
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

limited numbers and you can work with a few.

2

work with is five or 10, or particularly a very important one,

3

but anyway, you explain it.

4

MR. FISHER:

What you can't

Well, as I said, the typical situation

5

in Washington is more like two or three aggravators.

I

6

understand the Federal system is more complicated, but in the

7

state system, there's typically two or three aggravators and

8

in fact Washington itself proves that this works.

9

Washington has already singled out several factors they call

Because

12

on the list that they already require to be treated exactly in

Such as using a deadly weapon, selling

say.

But what I'm -- what I want to know is why is
If my client wanted to say he basically wasn't

How do you present that to a jury?
MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Breyer, one other point

23

is important here because, in many cases it's not going to be

24

such a big problem.

25

that has adopted this system essentially the fix that we think

However, in the one state that we've seen

said that if a defendant contests aggravating factors that not

-- they have to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, the statute also provides that in the

interest of justice the judge can sever the guilt phase and

the sentencing phase, and so if -- it puts the defendant.....

I don't see the problem -- I don't see

the problem of challenging it.

introduce the evidence of the aggravators, right?

10

MR. FISHER:

11

QUESTION:

It is up to the prosecution to

That's correct.

So the prosecution puts on one of the

12

customers in the bank who says, you know, he was using a gun.

13

The defendant is not going to be testifying anyway, unless

14

it's a very strange criminal trial.

15

happen is exactly what would happen in a normal trial.

16

defense counsel would seek to break down the story of the

17

witness that this person was carrying a gun.

18

were you, what kind of a gun was it, what color was it.

19

same thing that would happen in any trial it seems to me.

20

MR. FISHER:

It seems to me what would
The

How far away
The

Well, I think that's generally the

21

case, and that's why I said it's just like what might happen

22

for example in a lesser included case, when murder and

23

manslaughter was charged and it was the defendant's position

24

that it wasn't him.

25

QUESTION:

He wasn't around.
Yeah, put on the witness that says I want

1

to tell you -- they say he hit her with a gun and your witness

2

wants to say, oh no he only he brandished a gun, he didn't hit

3

her.

4

you're claiming that he was across the room.

That's quite a good witness to put on at the time that

MR. FISHER:

MR. FISHER:

8

QUESTION:

9

Right.

Well as I said, there are

Well, sometimes works, sometimes not?
Right.

The bizarre thing about this, which of

course I said I'm in the minority here.

The bizarre thing is,

10

it's hard for me to believe that the Constitution of the

11

United States requires, not that it doesn't permit.

12

requires a sentencing commission should Congress wish to take

13

discretion, total discretion away from the judge, which of

14

course your distinction leads to.

15

But

It's also very hard for me to believe that the

16

Constitution of the United States prohibits Congress from -­

17

prohibits it from saying, you know, I don't want to leave that

18

up -- to each judge to decide whether having a gun is worth

19

two years, or five years more.

20

I want to regularize this.

So those are the two dilemmas because you have to

21

chose A or B, if there's something unconstitutional about

22

this.

23

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Breyer, I think the

24

Constitution doesn't prevent Congress or any legislature at

25

all from regularizing criminal sentencing.

1

QUESTION:

True.

2

MR. FISHER:

Sentencing guideline systems are fine,

3

and Apprendi says nothing about whether legislatures can come

4

in, and regiment out and separate all the factors.

5

thing Apprendi says, is that if a sentence is conditioned on a

6

certain finding of fact, and there is a dispute about that

7

finding of fact, the defendant should have the right to have

8

the jury make that finding beyond a reasonable doubt rather

9

than have to judge.

10

QUESTION:

The only

Transfer that whole -- your rationale to

11

the Federal system and you have the grand jury first indict us

to the aggravators?

13

MR. FISHER:

MR. FISHER:

Why not?
Well, assuming the Federal system -- if

you're assuming the Federal system was covered by Apprendi.

I'm saying, assuming we apply your rule

frankly.

aggravators.

22

You can get a grand jury indictment for all the

MR. FISHER:

Well, to whatever extent a grand jury

23

needs to charge aggravated crimes I think they would need to

24

charge it and then apply

25

QUESTION:

Well, didn't Apprendi say that all the

elements had to be charged?
MR. FISHER:

Yeah.

Apprendi says that under fair

notice principles -- I'm going to stumble here a little bit.
QUESTION:

Why don't you just say yes, what's so

5

outrageous about that.

6

for another five years, you're saying he has a right to have a

7

jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that he did the additional

8

fact -- act which justifies the five years.

9

outrageous that that needs to be

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. FISHER:

12
13
14

I'm stumbling over the grand jury

because this is a state case, and not a Federal one.
QUESTION:

Yes.

But the question was, in the

Federal system.
MR. FISHER:

16

QUESTION:

18

What's so

Can the grand juries indict him for that?

15

17

The man's going to be sent to jail,

Right.

Obviously we've never held the Seventh

Amendment grand jury requirement applied to the state.
MR. FISHER:

Right.

But to the extent the grand

19

jury requirement applied it would -- the grand jury would need

20

to charge the aggravator just like anything else.

21

Justice Scalia

22

QUESTION:

And as

It seems to me you're -- you may not be

23

defendant friendly in all instances.

In this case, if the

24

defendant really wants to bargain for the lesser offense,

25

kidnaping II instead of kidnaping I, I suppose the prosecutor

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

would say that part of the bargain is that you stipulate to A,

2

B, and C.

3

before the judge that he wasn't guilty of the aggravators.

4

other words, it could work both ways.

5

And then he doesn't have the opportunity to argue

MR. FISHER:

In

Well, it can, but I think it's

6

important to look at the injustice in this case, Justice

7

Kennedy.

8

to any aggravators, however he got a sentence that was more in

9

line with kidnaping I, based on facts that he never

He made a deal to get kidnaping II, and didn't plead

10

acknowledged and he disputed.

11

QUESTION:

Well, the cap for the kidnaping I, was

12

much higher, and judges so often when they see aggravating

13

circumstances get close to whatever the cap is that they're

14

applying.

15

So I'm not sure
QUESTION:

Mr. Fisher, if you're -- if you are

16

correct here, I suppose all 50 states have sentencing schemes

17

that would fall as a result, isn't that right?

18
19

MR. FISHER:

By my study, Justice O'Connor, I don't

think that is correct.

20

QUESTION:

Why not?

21

MR. FISHER:

Well, there are only about 17 states

22

that have guideline systems right now.

By my count, only

23

about 10 of them have a system like the State of Washington's.

24

The other seven have systems where they do create standard

25

sentencing ranges, but then they leave it up to the judge to

21
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

depart from those ranges whenever they want to based on any

2

reason.

3

this Court says today.

4

those 10 systems like the State of Washington's.

Those systems I think are just fine no matter what

MR. FISHER:

Such as capital

That's right, Justice Scalia, and

obviously this Court has thought a lot about that issue

10

already in the prior Apprendi case, as to what -- what the

11

effects of its rulings are going to be.

12

QUESTION:

I guess I'd be afraid the effect is going

13

to be enshrine the plea bargaining system forever.

Because

14

that will be the only practical thing.

15

constitutional requirement that you have to have a sentencing

16

commission and the legislature can't do the work itself, which

17

is both undemocratic, a little hard to see why that's so -­

18

and produces just as much unfairness of the kind you're

19

complaining about.

20

pessimistic views.

Or to say there's a

Disabuse me, if you can, of these

21

MR. FISHER:

22

QUESTION:

23

MR. FISHER:

I'll try.

You agree that it's undemocratic?
What is undemocratic -- leaving it up

24

to judges?

Yes, but that's the whole point of Apprendi is

25

that the democratic constraints operate on a legislature, and

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

then when a legislature steps in, that different things apply.

2

And when the legislature says something, as footnote 16 in

3

Apprendi mentioned, it's a different force than when leaving

4

it up to the judges.

reserve the remainder of my time.

If it's all right with the Court, I'll

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN D. KNODELL, JR.

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13
14

MR. KNODELL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Whether the statutory maximums in the State of

15

Washington is what the legislature says it is, or the upper

16

end of the standard range, established only for the purposes

17

of enforcing legislative limitations of judicial discretion is

18

at the heart of this case.

19

that the answer to that question lies in the examination in

20

the way that the statute works.

And I would suggest to this Court

21

In Washington, the legislature of course like all

22

States, initially defines the elements of a crime, and sets

23

statutory maximums.

24

the crime, and look at the way they work, you will see that

25

they are substantially different, the kind of sentencing

criminal elements apply equally in every case.

measurement.

18

The

There's first a standard range and I would suggest to

The standard range is a baseline.

there's absolute discretion.

QUESTION:

Just -- you can give them up to 10 years,

2

but if you want to give them two years, that's okay.

3

that's not reviewable?

4

MR. KNODELL:

That's exactly right.

And

There is no

5

review.

And I would just -- you know, I would just to -- try

6

to impress upon you, Justice Scalia, that the -- there is a

7

range then between the upper end of the sentencing -- of the

8

standard range, and the statutory maximum, which is the zone

9

where the limitations -- the very minor limitations I submit

10

to the Court that are imposed upon the sentencing court or

11

enforced, that's the zone of limited discretion.

12

This limited discretion is limited only in two ways.

13

The court cannot -- cannot impose a sentence beyond the range

14

for reasons that the legislature considered in defining the

15

crime in the first place, and the court cannot -- cannot up

16

the statutory maximum -

17

believes that the defendant committed a more serious crime

18

than the crime of which he was convicted.

19

cannot impose a sentence because he

QUESTION:

But may I ask you this.

You point out

2

that he has to enunciate reasons.

3

have -- don't they have to cover basically two components.

4

First, they have to cover the component that you've alluded to

5

and that is some kind of the reasoning for engaging in the act

6

of discretion of going -- going above.

7

that this is not just, you know, more prejudice or anything

8

like that.

9

Don't the reasons have to

It's got to be clear

Doesn't it also have to have as a component the

10

identification, the finding of facts upon which this

11

discretion can be exercised.

12

The basis for going above was cruelty.

13

whatever it was.

14

suppose that a gun was used, that the woman was kept in this

15

box a great deal of the time and so on.

16

reason for doing what I'm doing.

2

taking a very impoverished view of what this statute does.

is based in some degree on facts.

But look what happens under the Washington

Discretion lies at the heart of this case.

Discretion

factor.

I believe that that, when you take a look at how the

there's not enough evidence to support that fact.

2

defendant is entitled to get that judgment reversed, because

3

that fact is essential to his being given the additional

4

penalty.

5

I understand the Constitution, when you're sent to jail for an

additional amount of time, on the basis of a fact that is

required to be found before you can be sentenced, that has to

15

whatever else.

16

there has to be support for it.

And whichever one he selects,

That fact has to be found by the judge and

MR. KNODELL:

That process that you're describing

18

where the judge takes a look at the case -- at the individual

19

before him, and selects what facts are going to be relevant,

20

and decides what weight to give them, and weighs that fact

21

against competing interests in sentencing is exactly the kind

22

of process that the judge went on -- went through in Williams.

That is a constitutional process that is not rendered

unconstitutional

23

and the way that fact is weighed, and the way it's used.

MR. KNODELL:

That's correct.

It's based on a

emphasize to you, is that that limited -- that limited

QUESTION:

But he didn't plead to -- he pled to

kidnaping II.

3

MR. KNODELL:

He pled and he was specifically told,

4

Justice Ginsburg, that he could receive up to 10 years, and

5

that the court had the right to go up to that amount if the

6

court found aggravating circumstances.

7

would be a hearing.

9

And he knew that there

So I -- I think what's important there, is not so
much what the number was, but how it was reached.

If it was

10

reached in a way that basically -- and I don't think mimic,

11

but was similar to the traditional sentencing process, but it

12

was simply structured by the -- structured by the legislature

13

and require the judges to enunciate a reason solely for

14

purpose, not as a hurdle to it, not as a prerequisite to the

15

exercise of jurisdiction beyond the standard range, but more

16

as a way for reviewing courts to make sure that the trial

17

court was not infringing upon the very limited limitations of

18

the Sentencing Reform Act.

19

And I think it's substantially different than

20

Apprendi.

And it does not violate the Sixth Amendment and

21

that is the way that our supreme court described -- describes

22

this and interprets the Sentencing Reform Act.

23

due -- due some deference by this Court.

I think that's

If you take a look at Baldwin, for example, you see

Baldwin describing the process -- excuse me, as one where the

articulate a substantial compelling reason for the imposing a

sentence.

4

discretionary decisions affecting sentences that they don't

5

specify any particular result.

6

That the guidelines are intended only to structure

And that makes this, I think, substantially

different from the kind of enhancements that we're involving

QUESTION:

Are there any states, or many states,

11

where juries hear as many as 10 factors as part of their

12

determination, and then make special findings in the matters?

13

MR. KNODELL:

I don't know of any and I would

14

suggest to Your Honor that that kind of a system is really

15

impractical for a number of reasons, we take it.

16

separate the logistical problems here, there's some real

17

structural problems with that.

18

If we

In a state like ours where crimes almost have to be

pled.

You would basically be left with a system, where the

20

prosecutor can tell the Judge, can tell the jury, dictate to

21

them what sentencing factors will or will not be considered.

22

When you instruct the jury you have to tailor a -- some kind

of instruction that would somehow try to approximate the kind

of wide range in discretion the Judge has.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL DREEBEN

4

FOR UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE

5
6

MR. DREEBEN:

Mr. Chief Justice and may it please

the Court:

7

Sentencing guideline systems, like the State of

8

Washington's and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines fulfil

9

valuable functions in regularizing the sentencing process, and

10

are distinctly different from the systems that this Court

11

considered in Apprendi and Ring.

12

QUESTION:

Do you agree that the two standards

13

together, that if this is invalid, the Federal Sentencing

14

Guidelines are invalid?

15

MR. DREEBEN:

Justice Scalia, the United States will

16

argue if this Court applies Apprendi to the Washington

17

guideline system, that it should not be further extended to

18

the administrative guidelines that are created by the

It is consistent with what we said in

MR. DREEBEN:

It is the judicial branch.

10

MR. DREEBEN:

Thank you for the lead in, Justice

11

Breyer.

12

the problem of sentencing guideline systems is to understand

13

the penalty systems fall on a continuum.

14

continuum are the kinds of statutes that the Court had before

15

it, Williams versus New York, in which judicial findings about

16

fact were critical to what sentence a defendant actually

17

received and those findings were not subjected to a jury

18

trial, or proof beyond a reasonable doubt guarantee.

19

I think that the best way for the Court to look at

MR. DREEBEN:

QUESTION:

I don't think so at that time, there was

very little appellate review of sentencing on Williams that

38

was decided.

3

MR. DREEBEN:

Very little but sheer arbitrariness

would probably not have sufficed even under Williams.

4

But

Well, he was foolish enough to say that,

5

you know I don't like the way you comb your hair.

6

wouldn't say that.

But he

He would just say, you know, 40 years.

7

MR. DREEBEN:

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. DREEBEN:

What he did

He didn't have to give a reason.
But what happened in fact in Williams

10

is critical.

The judge made findings that this defendant had

11

a long arrest record, he posed a future danger to the

12

community and he therefore deserved a longer sentence.

13

those were facts.

And

They were ascertained by a judge.

14

And there's no dispute in this Court's jurisprudence

15

that facts that are ascertained by a judge, when the judge has

16

wide open discretion in a long range are not subject to

17

Apprendi.

18

The facts.....
QUESTION:

Not only does he have wide open

19

discretion, but he has no obligation to make those findings.

20

He did make them in that case, but there was nothing in the

21

statute that required him to.

22

MR. DREEBEN:

But what the legislature expects,

23

Justice Stevens, when it gives wide ranges to judges, is that

24

they will exercise their discretion based on facts to sentence

25

the most serious offenders at the top of the range and the

QUESTION:

That's what they expect under sentencing

3

guidelines and what they expect today.

4

expected when Williams was decided.

5

MR. DREEBEN:

It's not what they

Well, Justice Stevens, what I would

6

submit to the Court is that when a legislature established a

7

wide range, say, 10 to 30 years in prison for a particular

8

offense, it expected that the judges that heard criminal cases

9

would use their experience and discretion to take into account

10

all of the circumstances of the offense and the offender and

11

determine whether rehabilitation and retribution were properly

12

served by a longer sentence, or a least harsh sentence.

13
14

And they did this, in the expectation of calling on
judicial wisdom based on particular facts.

QUESTION:

What they

But it wasn't just facts, you left a lot

It was really up to him whether this crime, not just

of society, should be given a longer or a shorter sentence.

1

QUESTION:

It's a different system.

2

MR. DREEBEN:

I agree with that, and it was a large

3

purpose of the sentencing guideline system to provide some

4

centralization for the policy decisions that are made in

5

sentencing to ensure uniformity, and proportionality.

6

this is what's critical for purposes of the Apprendi decision

7

here, also room for individualization.

But

8

Based on the judge's traditional perception, that

9

there are things in the record, or in the character of this

the Sixth Amendment which guarantees trial by jury, if you

don't think that the meaning is, that every fact which is

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. DREEBEN:

It means, Justice Scalia, that the

2

facts -- that the legislature itself identifies as warranting

3

the harsher punishment shall be found by the jury.

4

the legislature says to the judge, impose a sentence in the

5

standard range, unless you in your discretion determine that

6

there are circumstances that take the case outside the

7

standard range, or outside the heartland.

8
9

But when

In that event, the judge may exercise his discretion
to go up to what the legislature determines is the statutory

10

maximum, then what the judge's -- what the legislature has

11

attempted to do, is combine a system that will regularize and

12

provide some uniformity but at the same time import that

13

Williams discretion, the traditional discretion that this

14

Court has recognized is consistent with the Sixth Amendment.

15

And I submit that if in the Williams era a

16

legislature had passed a law that said, judges, we are giving

17

you a range of 10 to 50 years for this offense.

18

to figure out who should be sentenced where.

of inroads on judicial discretion automatically mean that the

Does that mean that the facts that are

elements of the crime must be found by the jury.

4

that are not elements of the crime, that are pertinent to

5

punishment can be found by a judge?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

The facts

That is exactly right, and that is

7

exactly what Washington purported to do when it said there are

So it used to be that the answer

to the elements question was the people will decide what's an

14

MR. DREEBEN:

I said general -­
What's

Well, Justice Breyer, if what the

15

legislature does is say to the judge, here's a standard range,

16

but you in the exercise of your discretion identifying whether

17

a factor takes the case outside what the sentencing commission

18

calls the heartland, what Washington calls the standard range,

19

then in that event you may go up to what we have defined as

20

the statutory maximum.

21

And by doing that, by calling upon judicial

22

discretion to consider unspecified factors, the legislature

23

has not erected surrogate elements, which is what the Court

24

found in Apprendi.

25

QUESTION:

Is that the nub of your argument?

That

45
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Apprendi is concerned with the erosion of jury trial, by the

2

combined efforts of the legislative and the executive branches

3

and we don't have to worry about the erosion of jury trial if

4

the operative determinations are left entirely within judicial

5

discretion, is that what you're argument boils down to?

6

MR. DREEBEN:

That is what it boils down to, Justice

7

Souter, because we're starting from a spectrum at which one

8

end lies Williams versus New York, in which the Court fully

9

accepted that it is entirely constitutional for a judge to

10

say, in my courtroom if you commit a kidnaping and you engage

11

in deliberate cruelty which I'm going to find by a

12

preponderance of the evidence, you're going to get the

13

maximum.

14

QUESTION:

All right.

If that in fact is the

15

position, then I take it, it is open to a legislature in a

16

case like this to say, instead of having a formal maximum

17

range, I forget what it is, but from zero to 10 years, we're

18

going to make it zero to 100 years, and we're going to leave

19

everything else to the discretion of the judiciary, and

20

Apprendi in effect will be a dead letter.

21

But your argument is that's okay, because we're not

22

worrying about the judiciary.

23

what it boils down to?

24

MR. DREEBEN:

25

Is that what it is, is that

I think that follows directly from

Williams versus New York, and it's an additional reason why

46

sentencing guideline systems.

react to a decision applying Apprendi to its guidelines the

the problem is that our standard range created a top of a

one of the eleven listed factors or one that is analogous to

5

those eleven factors.

Washington, or appellate decisions saying this aggravating

fact is not good enough.

And there are case after case in

But if the Gore decision, and the Cardenas decision
both cited in my briefs.

Another example is Barnes -- the

10

Barnes decision at 818 P.2d 1088 in which for example the

11

Washington Supreme Court said future dangerous which is a

12

common aggravating factor in other contexts, it's not a valid

13

aggravating factor in Washington in most kinds of crimes

14

because the legislature did not list that out.

15

And in fact what the Washington Supreme Court said

16

there, is they said, if we were to find that we would be

17

giving ourselves too much discretion back for the very point

18

of the Sentencing Reform Act was to take discretion away from

19

us, to go above the standard sentencing range.

20

The second point about Washington law is, Mr.

21

Knodell is right, that there is some discretion built into the

22

system, but that discretion kicks in only after the judge has

23

made the required factual finding.

24

is just like the one in Ring where the aggravating fact is

25

necessary but not sufficient for the ultimate sentence.

In that respect the system

goes to your question, the judge still once the jury or the

3

proper fact finder makes all the required factual findings,

4

the judge can still consider all the facts in the case, and go

5

anywhere below that new maximum that's been established.

6

- this, Justice Breyer,

So judicial discretion is still retained in Kansas'

7

system and it would be retained in Washington's system.

And

8

the final thing I'd like to say is that Mr. Dreeben's point

9

that this case is different than Ring because the fact that

10

they're illustrative rather than exclusive would lead to

11

Apprendi simply being a mere formality because all the

12

legislature would have to do, for example in the Ring case, is

13

have factor number 11 that says anything similar to the others

14

on this list.

15

Then you'd have people saying, well, judges can do

16

just about what they were doing, which was finding one of

17

those 10 factors, but because there's factor 11, that says

18

something similar to this is also good enough that Apprendi

19

somehow doesn't apply.

20

application of Apprendi as it was stated in Ring, requires a

21

reversal in this case.
