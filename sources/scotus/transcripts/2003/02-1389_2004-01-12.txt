ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENT L. JONES

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. JONES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
Federal employment taxes owed by a partnership

12

were assessed by the commissioner, and when the

13

partnership failed to pay the taxes, the United States

14

brought this action to recover the taxes against the

15

individual partners who were derivatively liable under

16

State law for all debts of the partnership, including its

17

tax debts.

18

QUESTION:

Did the Government have to wait until

19

the partnership failed to pay?

20

immediately against the partners under -- under the

21

governing State law?

22

MR. JONES:

Could it have proceeded

You've addressed an -- an unanswered

23

question that isn't presented here, of course.

24

unanswered because Federal law --

25

QUESTION:

It's

It -- it's not presented, depending

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

on what you mean by derivative liability.

2

thought that derivative liability would be liability that

3

doesn't attach unless and until the person primarily

4

liable fails to -- fails to pay up.

5

MR. JONES:

I -- I always

And -- and I agree with that, and --

6

and the Uniform Partnership Act, which California has

7

adopted, contains a provision that specifies that the

8

creditor must exhaust his efforts to recover from the

9

partnership before he can recover from the partners.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. JONES:

12

I see.
And -- and so that's what makes it

clear this is indeed a derivative secondary liability.

13

QUESTION:

You think maybe the United States may

14

not be bound by that.

15

don't want to concede that the United States is bound by

16

that.

17

MR. JONES:

You -- you don't want to -- you

It's not so much I don't want to

18

concede.

I don't feel that I'm able to concede that not

19

because it is related to this case, but because of a -- a

20

structural intellectual problem about the extent to which

21

whose law governs in that situation.

22

limitations provision, we know Federal law governs when

23

the United States is bringing a claim that it acquires in

24

its sovereign capacity.

25

a procedural restriction that the State substantive law

If it's a

Whether this would be regarded as

1

didn't -- now, whether you want to think this is

2

substantive or procedural may affect the answer to the

3

question -- the hypothetical that you've raised.

4

QUESTION:

Well, can you tell me as a matter of

5

practice if -- if you know?

Suppose there's a partnership

6

which is a little murky.

7

they're behind, but that one of the -- the general

8

partners is in California.

9

him, do you know?

It's in the Cayman Islands and

Can you just proceed against

Does the Revenue Service ever do that?

10

MR. JONES:

Well, there --

11

QUESTION:

-- ever do that?

12

QUESTION:

There -- there is an -- the uniform

13

-- in the case law, there's a discussion of situations

14

where the partnership is known to be insolvent.

15

not required to do a senseless act.

16

to pursue and exhaust against the partnership when it's

17

known to be insolvent.

18

exhausted because the partnership is insolvent.

19

QUESTION:

You're

You're not required

So in that situation, you have

And I take it in that situation --

20

you correct me if I'm wrong -- but you can't just levy on

21

the account if the tax has not been assessed against that

22

partner individually, but you can commence some other

23

sorts of proceedings which would allow a subsequent levy.

24

Or am I wrong, or is that clear?

25

MR. JONES:

Well, you've brought me through --

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

to a lot of levels of complexity, but I think the answer

2

to the question is we -- we don't dispute that you need to

3

give a -- a notice of assessment in order to collect

4

administratively through liens and levies.

5

relevant to this case because this is a judicial

6

collection case.

7

QUESTION:

8

MR. JONES:

That's not

Of course.
But, nonetheless, there is case law

9

that says that when you give notice to the partnership of

10

its liability, that's sufficient as constructive notice to

11

the partners to permit administrative collection through

12

liens and levies.

13

QUESTION:

Mr. Kent, if you're not right about

14

that and you do have to have individual notice and demand

15

to the partners, then there's a consequence other than

16

liens and levies, isn't there, where you have whopping

17

penalties and interest attached?

18

give notice and demand within the 60-day period, then not

19

only can't you impose liens, but that the interest and

20

penalties stop running.

21

MR. JONES:

I thought if you don't

I'm -- I'm familiar with the -- the

22

concept of interest doesn't run until notice of the

23

assessment is made, but nonetheless again, notice to the

24

partnership would be constructive to the partners.

25

QUESTION:

But if you're wrong about that

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

constructive notice, then you could still say, well, the

2

statute has been extended 10 years because of the

3

assessment.

4

stops running and that you can't use administrative

5

collection procedures.

6

However, one might conclude that the interest

MR. JONES:

Well, I -- I don't mean to be -- I

7

don't mean to sound like I'm retreating from that issue.

8

I'm just -- it's not presented here, and so I'm not really

9

capable standing here --

10

QUESTION:

Well, it would be to the extent on --

11

if -- if this thing is remanded with instructions that the

12

assessment counts against all of them, that there would be

13

the question remaining about the interest and penalties.

14

MR. JONES:

That's -- I don't -- it is possible,

15

and if the Court were to reverse and remand for further

16

proceedings, it's possible that that issue would be

17

raised.

18
19
20

QUESTION:

Are you -- are you saying that we

should maybe flag it but not decide it?
MR. JONES:

Is it --

I don't -- I don't know what your

21

practice would be.

I would think your practice would be

22

to decide the issue that's presented.

23

other issues haven't been raised, but since those issues

24

haven't been briefed here, we're not really in a position

25

to advise you on their proper resolution.

3

QUESTION:

Why don't you go ahead with the

issues that are presented?
MR. JONES:

Okay.

Well, the point I was making

4

was that the court ruled against us because they said that

5

the partnership taxes had not been assessed directly

6

against the partners.

7

concede that there is no requirement of Federal law that a

8

derivative or secondary State law liability to pay a tax

9

has to be assessed before it can be collected, and that

10

concession is plainly correct in light of this Court's

11

decision in 1933 in the Leighton case where the Court held

12

that a derivative or secondary liability that arises under

13

State law to pay a tax may be recovered -- and I quote --

14

without assessment of that liability.

15

numerous cases that have applied that principle in -- in

16

related secondary and derivative liability contexts.

17

And as -- as I've already indicated, those

But respondents now correctly

And there are

18

principles plainly apply here because under the Uniform

19

Partnership Act, which applies in California, the

20

liability of the partner is derivative for the -- and

21

secondary rather than principal, as I've discussed with

22

Justice Scalia.

23

structure of the UPA, but the official comments to the --

24

of -- to that act state that the liability of the

25

partnership for partnership debts is principal and that

Not only is it clear from the legal

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the liability of partners is -- is in the nature of a

2

guarantor.

3

partnership doesn't pay its own debts.

4

It's secondary.

It arises only when the

Federal law also makes clear that this is a

5

liability that attaches directly to the partnership.

6

is a Federal employment tax.

7

because, under California law, the -- the partnership is a

8

separate and distinct legal entity.

9

It pays the wages.

10

This

It applies to employers

It is the employer.

Its payment of wages is what causes

the taxes to be imposed.

11

QUESTION:

But you -- you agree that it's the

12

law of California that imposes the derivative liability on

13

the partners?

14

MR. JONES:

That's the way the cases describe

15

it.

From my -- and that's the way this Court described it

16

in -- in Commissioner v. Stern.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. JONES:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. JONES:

What more do you want?
Pardon me?
I say what more do you want.
Well, I don't want more.

I'm just

21

being finicky I guess, because to me we -- the Court in

22

Commissioner v. Stern said that these -- historically

23

these are substantive liabilities that Congress accepts

24

from State law.

25

substantive body of State rules in -- in implementing that

And therefore, the Court applies the

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

liability.

2

You could also think of this -- and I'm not

3

asking the Court to reconsider Commissioner v. Stern.

4

you can -- even in light of Commissioner v. Stern, you can

5

think of this as Federal law borrowing State law for this

6

remedial purpose, and Congress has sanctioned that by not

7

altering the principles that have long existed on this.

8

But

The -- but the -- the point that this Court made

9

in Leighton is that these principles that they apply come

10

from State law and you don't a -- actually respondents now

11

admit there's no mechanism in Federal law to assist this

12

-- assess this sort of secondary derivative State law

13

liability, and that's correct.

14

addressed in the Leighton case.

15

in this case just misapplied those well-accepted

16

principles.

17

That's what the Court
And the court of appeals

Once the assessment of the partnership taxes was

18

made, under section 6502 the United States has 10 years

19

from the date of the assessment to bring any proceeding in

20

court to collect the taxes.

21

1930, the Court held that that 10 years applies not only

22

to actions against the directly liable party but also to a

23

person whose liability is derivative or secondary and

24

arises from State law.

25

broad purpose and broad text of 6502 applies equally in

And in the Updike case in

And the Court explained that the

10
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

both cases because in the Court's words, in a real sense

2

the action against the derivatively liable party is a

3

proceeding in court to collect the tax.

4

in Updike, the aim in the one case, as in the other, is

5

the same.

6

As the Court said

It's to collect the tax liability.
Now, in this Court respondents do not dispute

7

that accepted understanding of 6502.

Instead, they raise

8

here a new and, indeed, a radical claim that no court has

9

adopted and that they did not raise prior to their merits

10

brief in this Court.

What they argue now for the first

11

time is that the Federal statute of limitations should not

12

govern this derivative liability claim because since it

13

stems from substantive State law, the State statute of

14

limitations should govern it.

15

raise that claim at any time before their merits brief in

16

this Court -- and it is a statute of limitations which is

17

an affirmative defense -- they're -- they've waived the

18

claim as too rate to -- too late to raise it.

Now, since they didn't

19

But nonetheless, I think it is important to note

20

that their claim is plainly inconsistent with this Court's

21

decisions.

22

held that whenever the United States acquires a claim

23

acting in its governmental capacity, that claim of the

24

United States is not subject to a State statute of

25

limitations because of the sovereign rights -- sovereign

For example, in the Summerlin case, this Court

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

immunity of the United States.

And they applied that

2

holding in Summerlin to a situation where what the United

3

States obtained was a right to enforce a private note and

4

private mortgage that the --

5

QUESTION:

May I interrupt for this question?

6

You know, there are some State statutes of limitations

7

that -- or some States have limitations provisions that

8

are either affirmative defenses or some are, in effect,

9

conditions precedent to bringing an action.

If California

10

had the latter form of action, how would you decide this

11

case?

12

MR. JONES:

I think that in -- in Commissioner

13

v. Bresson where the Ninth Circuit addressed that very

14

point, they -- they were -- they wrote a very useful

15

opinion that seems to me to be perfectly correct, that the

16

-- that if it is the passage of time after the United

17

States acquires its right that causes the claim to expire,

18

that that is what is barred by the Summerlin rationale

19

because the sovereign rights of the United States can't be

20

extinguished.

21

extinguishing the claim or limiting the -- the period of

22

recovery, in either event what's instrumental is that the

23

-- the United States had the right at the time it obtained

24

the claim and that the State law could not thereafter cut

25

that right off.

And so whether you think of it as

Why -- why -- suppose that

5

6

State law govern the period of time in respect to which

7

any creditor, including the Government, has to assert a --

8

a claim under that note, let's say, or under that

9

particular written guarantee since the liability there is

10

a creation of State law and the State would have the right

11

to define its contours?

12

not the taxpayer.

solely out of the fact that he happens to have entered

into a note with a guarantor who promised to pay.

MR. JONES:

That's -- that's a -- that's exactly

frankly what happened in Summerlin --

QUESTION:

4

MR. JONES:

Yes.
-- except Summerlin involved a

5

housing program instead of the Internal Revenue Code.

6

Summerlin, the Government obtained a private note and

7

enforced it, regardless of the State statute of

8

limitations, and the Court's reasoning was that the --

9

that the United States as sovereign cannot be subject to

10
11

In

limitations imposed on the rights that it obtains.
QUESTION:

So if I -- if I enter into a promise

12

with you and say in return for my lending, you know,

13

whatever it is, I -- I promise that I will pay your tax

14

debts, but by the way, I don't want to pay any tax debt

15

that isn't definite before January the 5th, 2004 or 2010.

16

I don't want to pay anything that arises --

17

MR. JONES:

It's a limit -- if you're talking

18

about a substantive limitation in the document itself,

19

well, the United States takes its -- stands in the shoes

20

of the assignor in that situation, and we don't get a

21

better substantive right -- substantive right.

22

So it's a substantive

procedural distinction.
MR. JONES:

Court has looked at it, and I --

1

QUESTION:

But you know, in -- in other cases,

2

let's say when the -- when the Federal Government creates

3

a Federal right without establishing a statute of

4

limitations for that Federal right, State law does not

5

govern, but Federal law looks to the -- to the State

6

statute of limitations as a matter of Federal law.

7

don't know why it wouldn't be the same thing with respect

8

to a -- a Federal claim.

9

limitations whatever on Federal claims?

10

MR. JONES:

No.

I

You mean there is no statute of

Well, that's the second route

11

that the Court has used to say the State's limitations

12

don't control, and that is, when there's a Federal

13

limitations period that applies to the claim, then the

14

State provision doesn't control.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. JONES:

Of course.
And under -- under Updike, what this

17

Court concluded in Updike was that there is a Federal

18

statute of limitations that applies to these proceedings

19

in court to collect the taxes, which includes the

20

derivative claim.

21

QUESTION:

Well, that -- that's fine.

But I'm

22

talking about the more general proposition that -- that

23

you're -- that you're defending or -- or proposing that --

24

that State law does not -- never -- never applies to a --

25

to a Federal claim.

8

Well, it doesn't --

Exactly.
But it applies because of adoption by

the United States.
MR. JONES:

If the -- if the Court were to find

10

it appropriate in a particular instance to adopt a State

11

rule, that would not interfere with Summerlin, but that

12

would -- that would -- I can't think of a case exactly

13

like that.

14
15
16

There may well be some.
But most Federal claims --

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

18

QUESTION:

20

Most --- the clock keeps ticking on Federal

claims forever and ever.
MR. JONES:

Most Federal claims come within some

21

general statute of limitations, and this is certainly a

22

situation like that.

23

I

can't imagine our saying that, you know --

17

19

I can't imagine our not doing it.

QUESTION:

Is it -- is this question really

24

academic in this case because you have not one but two

25

Federal limitations, one, the regular 3-year period, then

the extension by 10 years following an assessment?
MR. JONES:

Well, I think the Updike case makes

3

this discussion somewhat hypothetical, and I understood

4

Justice Scalia's question to be in that vein.

5

QUESTION:

But here, what you're relying on are

6

the Federal limitations period.

7

worry about suppose there had been no Federal limitations.

8
9

MR. JONES:

So you don't need to

I -- I don't need to worry about

them, and I -- but I'm only addressing them because

10

respondents have raised them at this point in the case,

11

and so I'm just discussing the two theories that this

12

Court has applied in rejecting that kind of contention.

13
14

QUESTION:

You're saying it's doubly

hypothetical because they can't raise the whole issue --

MR. JONES:

16

QUESTION:

17

MR. JONES:

18

QUESTION:

Yes.
-- at this point anyway.
Yes, sir.
I thought their primary position,

19

though, was that the partners are not secondarily liable,

20

they're primarily liable, so that they are the taxpayer

21

and they're entitled to assessment notice and demand.

22

MR. JONES:

That is now clearly their primary

23

position, and for the reasons I've already described that

24

position can't be reconciled with the Uniform Partnership

25

Act or with -- or with the Federal law that applies to

QUESTION:

Can you -- can you tell me in the

3

case of a corporation, if the responsible officer does not

4

withhold employment taxes, I -- I take it -- I thought I

5

remembered that -- that the responsible officer is

6

personally liable.

7

Or am I wrong about that?

MR. JONES:

Yes.

There is a statute that

8

authorizes an assessment of that liability against a

9

responsible officer.

10

QUESTION:

11

MR. JONES:

Ah, but you have to assess it.
It -- it authorizes the assessment.

12

That's -- you know, it's interesting.

13

types --

15

QUESTION:

There are certain

Can -- can you proceed against the

responsible officer without the assessment?

16

MR. JONES:

If you have a claim based on State

17

law or common law, and that's the reason we have a

18

responsible officer statute is that this is a Federal

19

claim.

20

and in the ordinary transferee situation, there's not a

21

backup State law action.

22

There isn't -- unlike in the partnership situation

QUESTION:

Well, if -- if in the case of

23

corporate officers, there must be an assessment, then by

24

analogy it would seem that it wouldn't be too much trouble

25

for the IRS to assess the partners in your case.

MR. JONES:

Well, sometimes it is troublesome,

2

but it's not required in any situation under our

3

understanding of the existing law.

4

QUESTION:

I -- I thought that it was required

in the -- in -- in the corporate case.

be assessed against the responsible officer.

MR. JONES:

Oh, I'm sorry.

You said it has to

I thought you were

8

talking about the partnership then.

9

responsible officers -- officer liability is created by

10

Federal statute, unlike the partners' obligation for the

11

debts of the partnership.

12

QUESTION:

Yes.

I -- the

I'm simply wondering if -- if that

13

isn't a model, if that's what happens in the corporate

14

instance, in this case where the statute is -- is silent

15

on the point, whether we shouldn't just assume that since

16

it's not too much of a burden on the Government in the

17

corporate context to require it to assess the responsible

18

officer before the tax can be collected, that we shouldn't

19

say the same thing here.

20

MR. JONES:

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. JONES:

There is -I'm just -I understand.

But the responsible

23

officer liability is -- is really a radically different

24

concept.

25

knowledge of the fact that the taxes weren't being paid as

It only -- it only arises when that officer had

1

they accrued and willfully failed to pay them and -- and

2

was responsible, had the responsibility to pay them.

3

is a -- it is a malfeasance claim, whereas the derivative

4

liability claim is just under State law, you are liable as

5

is the partnership, and we can enforce that State law.

6

There's another example --

QUESTION:

MR. JONES:

9

It

There's a --- where the similar thing happened.

3505, which is the lender's liability.

There was no

10

lender's liability for employment taxes that the Court

11

discussed in the Jersey Shore case.

12

have a -- a common law precedent, and so Congress created

13

the liability because they saw a specific problem where

14

lenders were allowing or in -- in effect, helping

15

employers evade employment taxes by loaning them money

16

from which they paid wages but didn't paid taxes.

17

Congress created this separate statutory scheme.

18

That liability didn't

And so

But respondents are correct in their concession

19

that there is no mechanism under Federal law for assessing

20

the derivative State law liability of a partner for the

21

debts of the partnership.

22

in Leighton, we can proceed without assessment against

23

them to enforce that liability.

24
25

And so as the Court held in --

Now, I do want to also mention the -- the
citations that respondents make to section 6303.

That

20
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

section appears in the portion of the code that addresses

2

administrative collection through liens and levies, and it

3

states that the Secretary is to give notice of the

4

assessment to any person liable for the tax.

5

that have interpreted and applied that statute, which stem

6

from 1954, have -- have concluded correctly that that

7

statute applies only to administrative collection through

8

liens and levies and has no application to judicial

9

collection actions.

10

The cases

And there's a -- a sound historical explanation

11

for that, and that is that prior to 1954, there were two

12

independent routes for collecting taxes.

13

was authorized by the code to bring a judicial collection

14

suit, but there was a separate officer known as the

15

collector of revenue for each district.

16

of revenue was, by the code, authorized to do the

17

administrative collection through liens and levies.

18

the predecessor of 6303 had said that the collector is to

19

give notice of the assessment and make demands for

20

payment.

21

his actions in administrative collection and had no

22

application of the Secretary's independent authority to

23

bring a judicial collection suit.

The Secretary

And the collector

And

And it was well established that that applied to

24

In 1954 in revising the code, Congress

25

eliminated references to the collector in the code, placed

1

the Secretary in charge both of the -- of judicial and

2

administrative enforcement and changed the predecessor

3

language of 6303 from saying the collector is to give

4

notice to saying the Secretary is to give notice.

5

doing so, Congress did not mean to change -- and the

6

courts that have reviewed this have correctly concluded

7

did not change -- the fact that this notice of assessment

8

requirement applies only to the administrative collection

9

area, has no application to judicial collection suits like

10

But in

this one.
QUESTION:

Are you conceding then that there

could be no liens and levies against the partners here

because there was no notice and demand --

QUESTION:

So the other doesn't apply.

So I'm

2

asking you if you are now making the concession that those

3

words -- what are they -- each person liable for unpaid

4

tax, would stop you from using the administrative

5

collection route because you didn't give notice and demand

6

individually.

7

MR. JONES:

Let me -- I can't say what we did or

8

didn't do in notice because there's nothing in the record

9

on that in this case because administrative collection

10

isn't involved in this case.

11

QUESTION:

12
13

Well, let's assume you gave notice

and demand only to the partnership.
MR. JONES:

Okay, let's assume that.

If we gave

14

notice and demand to the partnership, what we would be

15

authorized to do is clearly under 6321 and -- make a lien

16

and levy against any assets of the partnership.

17

as I said, although -- the -- the cases are also perfectly

18

consistent that the notice to the partnership is valid as

19

constructive notice to the partners.

20

And then

And so, for example, if we have a partnership

21

employment tax liability from Smith Construction and the

22

two partners are Bob Jones and Bill Wilson, notice of the

23

assessment to the partnership is valid as notice to its

24

two partners.

25

the tax, but if a third party creditor is out there, First

And so our lien arises, if they don't pay

may not be notice to the First National Bank.

3

lien contest we might not have the prior lien vis-a-vis

4

this other party, but vis-a-vis the two partners, the

5

cases say that our notice is valid for 6303 purposes to

6

them because, well, of course, a partnership only acts

7

through its partners and notice to one of them or to the

8

partnership is valid, constructive notice to all the

9

others.

10

And so in a

There is no case inconsistent with that

conclusion, but again, it's plainly not presented in this

15

This is just a judicial

The only issue that is really before the Court

is whether we have to give notice -- I'm sorry -- whether

MR. HABERBUSH:

Your Honor, what we argued was

that if the Federal statutes did not apply, section 6303

Did the court of appeals touch on it?

A

10

partner's liability for the debts of a partnership may

11

arise under State law, and this Court has noted in the

12

case of United States v. Kraft that State law defines the

rights as between the parties, but the manner by which it

It has nothing to do with exhaustion

of remedies.

State insofar as it sees the partner as a guarantor of the

liability that is created by a different entity, namely

also extends.

Yes, yes.

You're back to your

11

question of whether under partnership law in fact this is

12

a guarantor or the equivalent or a surety.

that argument, but it sounds to me as if that argument is

14

resolved against you, this statute of limitations argument

15

is a serious red herring because it won't matter.

Is it a tax claim or is it a claim which

10

is derived from the partnership liability?

In other

11

words, is it a tax debt or is it a debt because they're

liable for a debt of the partnership so that it loses its

13

nature as a tax claim?

14

If that's the case, this is a bankruptcy case.

Well, Your Honor --

And State law makes them, in effect,

15

This is a tax debt.

MR. HABERBUSH:

So they're

All of the cases referred to for

the coterminous statute of limitations, which is what

17

would be suggested would be applied here if in fact they

18

are liable for this tax debt and therefore the provisions

of the Internal Revenue Code apply, are all cases where

where the collection assessment and enforcement of the tax

as the tax itself.

5

cases like Leighton and Updike where the statute of

There is nothing in the Internal Revenue Code

So it's not surprising that you have

If

10

one adopts the guarantor analogy, then this is conceivable

a case where any number of years could pass where the

partners would become liable.

Your -- I would point out the Court's record in

the joint appendix.

At pages 100 and 102, we have the

proofs of claim that were filed in these bankruptcy cases,

and these proofs of claim on their face show that the

maybe they're right about that, but that's not before the

MR. HABERBUSH:

That's not -- that may not be

before the Court, but the Government has taken the

position the only way, the sole and single way, it can

10

collect taxes is to file suits against partners.

11

suggest that if the Court were to permit assessment, rule

12

that they are taxpayers subject to assessment, subject to

So let's suppose they're like guarantors.

that that's how the normal State law runs.

11

So unless there's something Federal to the

contrary -- and by the way, if there is, they have 10 more

MR. HABERBUSH:

To that extent, the opinion is

wrong for the reason that it is a well-held proposition

that suit or assessment may be brought under section 6501

Given those two facts, then this Court's holding

in Leighton seems clearly applicable, which is that we

don't have to assess a derivative State law liability to

bring suit to recover upon that liability.

16

Now, respondents say, well, somehow that holding

17

is influenced by the fact that transferee liability is

18

provided in 6901 of the code.

19

in the Leighton case what the Court held was that the 6901

20

transferee liability is a supplementary remedy that did

21

not displace and, indeed, left in place the right of the

22

United States to bring its suit upon the derivative State

law liability without assessment.
