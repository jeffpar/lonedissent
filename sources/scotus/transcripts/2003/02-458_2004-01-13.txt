CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST:

Mr. Holifield.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. HOLIFIELD

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

8
9

MR. HOLIFIELD:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:

10

Petitioners believe that a sole owner may be a

11

participant in an employee benefit plan if another common

12

law employee participates in such plan, regardless of

13

whether that corporation or entity transacts business as a

14

sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation.

15

belief is based on a plain reading of ERISA, the plan

16

language in question here, the statutory scheme of ERISA,

17

the DOL regulations and the policy considerations beside

18

-- excuse me -- behind such regulations.

19

This

When ERISA was passed, it incorporated the term

20

employee.

21

v. Darden and held that the term employee includes a

22

common law employee.

23

plan says if you're an employee with a right to a benefit,

24

then you've met the definition of participant.

25

looking at these two terms alone, Yates was a participant

This Court dealt with that term in Nationwide

And -- and the term participant in a

In just

3
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

in this plan and it's the petitioners' position as such he

2

had the rights to enforce the rights of ERISA.

3

If you further read, the terms of the plan in

4

and of itself support this.

5

plan and the plan allowed for sole owners, sole

6

proprietors, partnerships, or even incorporated entities

7

to participate as sole owners in the plan if they covered

8

other common law employees.

9

This was an IRS prototype

On top of this, if you look at the ERISA

10

statutory schemes, when ERISA was passed, title I

11

addressed many different concerns.

12

explained the definition of employee and participant

13

specifically include the person such as Yates as allowing

14

him to participate because he is an employee.

15

As I've already

Furthermore, if you look at, for instance, ERISA

16

section 1103(b), that provision excludes as an exclusion

17

for certain aspects to the trust requirements of ERISA.

18

One of those specific exclusions if -- is that some or all

19

employees are employees as defined in the Internal Revenue

20

Code, and a specific reference is made to 26 U.S.C.

21

401(c)(1).

22

IRS Code and the ERISA law being congruent in its

23

administration of plans and a specific reference to a

24

definition of working employers that includes self-

25

employed individuals, partnerships, and -- and people such

And so you -- you see a pattern here that the

4
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

as that.

2

When ERISA was passed, title II of ERISA

3

specifically dealt with changes to the tax code.

4

with specifically amendments to code section 401.

5

Since --

6

QUESTION:

It dealt

Mr. Holifield, I'm curious whether if

7

-- if we were to agree with you that the petitioner could

8

be considered an employee under ERISA, do we have to then

9

go on and address the rest of this rather complicated

10

question on the alienation issue and so forth, or would we

11

remand on that?

12

MR. HOLIFIELD:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. HOLIFIELD:

Your Honor --

It wasn't dealt with below, was it?
No, it wasn't, Your Honor.

And

15

it -- it's -- certainly I could make an argument here that

16

Patterson and Guidry is controlling on that matter of

17

anti-alienation, but that issue wasn't the particular

18

issue --

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HOLIFIELD:

21
22

No.
-- raised in this Court, and --

and not addressed in the lower courts.
QUESTION:

What is the -- what is that issue?

23

Because I saw some -- I'm not sure that we're talking

24

about the same issue.

25

wasn't addressed?

What is the issue that you say

5
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

MR. HOLIFIELD:

The issue that was not addressed

2

in the lower courts is there is the maybe potential

3

conflict with the Bankruptcy Code as far as preference

4

laws and the ERISA anti-alienation provision.

5

QUESTION:

In other words, this $50,000 wasn't

6

put back until the eve of bankruptcy so even if -- even if

7

we agreed with you that Yates can be an employee, this

8

$50,000 still might constitute an unlawful preference.

9

MR. HOLIFIELD:

Your Honor, it -- it might.

10

There's certainly language, I believe, in the Sixth

11

Circuit opinion and the district court opinion that they

12

both held that had -- certainly indicated it would be

13

dicta that had Yates been declared a participant in the

14

plan, they would have enforced the anti-alienation

15

provisions, but there was no specific holding on that

16

point.

17
18

QUESTION:

And even if there was, that's not

before us.

19

MR. HOLIFIELD:

20

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

We -- theoretically we could agree

21

with you that he's a participant and so forth but still

22

say send it back for the bankruptcy issue.

23
24
25

MR. HOLIFIELD:

That is within the prerogative

of this Court, Your Honor.
When title II was enacted, it was enacted with

6
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the -- an understanding that in 1942 the Revenue Act of --

2

was passed that allowed shareholder employees to

3

participate in a plan.

4

Tax Retirement Act was passed and that allowed sole

5

proprietors or partnerships to form a Keogh plan in which

6

-- and whether they could participate in a plan that only

7

covered themselves or allowed it if it covered other

8

employees.

9

In 1962, Self-Employed Individuals

ERISA was passed in '74, and it was passed with

10

an understanding that these tax code provisions were

11

there.

12

amend the tax code, it did not change any of these

13

definitions.

14

working owners, if you'll let me call them that, to

15

participate in these plans and had Congress wanted to

16

exclude them, they could have.

17

people.

18

When Congress was amending title II of ERISA to

It clearly allowed these sole owners, these

QUESTION:

They knew how to exclude

Does it have to be a working owner?

19

Could it be someone who just owns shares and doesn't work

20

in the business?

21

MR. HOLIFIELD:

Possibly, Your Honor.

Yes.

I

22

mean, that is -- very rare does that occur.

23

may see that in a group health plan, but not typically in

24

a retirement plan.

25

there's nothing to prevent that.

Typically you

You may see those types of things, but

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

That -- that would be pretty far

2

afield from the word employee.

3

for example, did -- did Yates -- he was a -- a working

4

owner.

5

MR. HOLIFIELD:

6

QUESTION:

7

Yes, Your Honor.

Was -- were FICA and FUTA taxes paid

for his labor?

8
9

I mean, one could be --

MR. HOLIFIELD:

Yes, Your Honor.

In the terms

of -- I think the record is critical on this that he's a

10

common law employee.

11

defined compensation as W-2 compensation, which means FICA

12

and FUTA, as you're inquiring, was withheld.

13

W-2 employee, the monies that were contributed to this

14

plan were based on a percentage of his W-2 compensation.

15

So from a common law standpoint, just pure corporate law,

16

he was an employee of that corporation who was handed a

17

W-2 as an employee of the Yates P.C., and it was based on

18

that compensation that his contributions were made to the

19

plan.

20

The retirement plan in and of itself

And so as a

In title IV of ERISA, there's an exclusion for

21

plans maintained solely for substantial owners.

22

point I'm making, whether you look at title I, title II,

23

or title IV, you see references to sole owners being in

24

there or not -- possible ways they could be excluded, but

25

none of them that would prevent them from participating in

And the

8
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

plans such as this.

2

And I think if you look at that, as well as look

3

at the DOL regulatory scheme that has come out of this,

4

the DOL opinion letters report this conclusion, be that

5

79-08A which is in the record at J.A. -- the joint

6

appendix at 271 and 273, the opinion letter 99-04A at 274a

7

and 283a.

8

is part of UNUM Providence brief at appendix 1, and that's

9

a letter from Robert Dole to Susan Hoffman.

You see an information letter that's actually

Each of these

10

is where the DOL has opined an opinion that people that

11

are working owners can be a participant in an employee

12

benefit plan.

13

is pretty clear.

And so I think the case law on that point

14

And I think where the confusion comes into play

15

is this definition of employee benefit plan in a reg that

16

has been misread by, I believe, two circuits on that

17

point.

18

of itself shows that working owners were intended to be

19

included in these plans if they had another participant in

20

the plan.

And I think just a plain reading of the reg in and

And --

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. HOLIFIELD:

23

QUESTION:

24

MR. HOLIFIELD:

25

Here there were a couple of other -Yes, Your Honor.

-- plan participants at all times?
Yes, Your Honor.

The

stipulation of facts point that -- that there were always

9
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

other participants in the plan besides the working owner

2

since these plans were formed in 1989.

3

And so just for the policy reasons behind that

4

is I think the preambles to the reg further shed light

5

about the definition of employee benefit plan.

6

the Department of Labor was weighing here was do you

7

really want to have working owners that are the sole

8

owners, sole participants of the plan, have to comply with

9

the ERISA burdens.

And what

In other words, is there a need to

10

tell the working owner, even though there's no one else in

11

the plan, you need to give yourself a summary plan

12

description?

13

reporting about the plan.

14

rights for a health plan to yourself.

15

created that plan, you are in a situation that you are

16

aware of the benefits of the plan.

17

have one other employee, then there's a necessity for you

18

to communicate those rights and benefits and explain the

19

terms of the plan.

20

You need to file an annual tax return
You need to communicate COBRA
Presumably if you

But as soon as you

And that seems to be a pretty reasonable reading

21

of what the DOL was trying to balance here.

22

preambles, they even said, one, there's no reason to

23

protect any abuse here, and secondly, that's not a good

24

use of our resources to administer sole owner/sole

25

participant plans.

In their

And given that background, I think

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

3

that's how that reg should be read.
QUESTION:

How does it come in?

just if you could clarify.

I'm -- I'm --

This is a little --

4

MR. HOLIFIELD:

5

QUESTION:

6

But basically -- so we have all the

Sure.

-- complicated in my mind.

7

characteristics of a plan.

8

by saying that Dr. Yates is an employee of the corporation

9

called Raymond Yates, P.C.

Now, you have to start first

And then it's not a plan,

10

however, because he's -- wait a minute.

11

unless -- if there are no employees.

12

MR. HOLIFIELD:

13

QUESTION:

14

It's not a plan

Yes, Your Honor.

And an owner is not an employee for

that purpose.

15

MR. HOLIFIELD:

16

QUESTION:

Correct.

And so we look to see.

There is

17

another one, and therefore, what section 25103.3 took away

18

under (b) -- under (c) it gave back under (b).

19

MR. HOLIFIELD:

20

QUESTION:

21

Or it gave back because there was

somebody else.

22

MR. HOLIFIELD:

23

QUESTION:

24
25

Yes, Your Honor.

Yes.

But step one of that, we had to say

that he was an employee of the corporation.
MR. HOLIFIELD:

Yes, Your Honor.

11
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

QUESTION:

And where does step one come from?

2

MR. HOLIFIELD:

Well, step one is just based on

3

common law and the work -- and that is what this Court

4

held in Darden.

5

If you look at that, that --

QUESTION:

Okay.

So we have to say -- we have

6

to find -- we have to first find that he is an employee

7

and, in fact, these regs don't give a definition of that.

8

MR. HOLIFIELD:

9

QUESTION:

Exactly.

So we have to appeal to the common

10

law to say he's -- he's an employee under common law

11

principles of the corporation.

12

MR. HOLIFIELD:

13

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

Then (b) says -- (c) says he isn't

14

one for purposes of ERISA, and (b) says that really wrecks

15

the whole thing unless there's somebody else.

16

MR. HOLIFIELD:

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. HOLIFIELD:

19

QUESTION:

20

MR. HOLIFIELD:

Correct.

And that's how it works.
Exactly, Your Honor.

Okay.
And I think if you look at --

21

what the -- the holding in the Sixth Circuit, I really

22

think it really creates some policy problems for employee

23

benefit plans that are -- are pretty significant.

24

instance, the holding was that there is an employee

25

benefit plan here which -- with the issue you just raised.

For

12
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

And then it said, but there's not a participant -- Yates

2

is not a participant in that plan.

3

don't know what you call it because he's been under one

4

plan document since the passage of the plan, since it was

5

enacted, and so now there's a presumption that this aspect

6

of the plan is governed under State law, even though

7

there's never been a provision provided such as that.

8

plan document is the same plan.

9

get fiduciaries in a situation like this having

So you have this -- I

The

And you could very easily

10

inconsistent State law claims versus Federal claims.

You

11

could end up having situations that really make no sense.

12

And one of the -- the primary purposes of ERISA

13

was to avoid the very issue that that would cause and that

14

is they wanted a uniform administrative scheme for all of

15

the States and now there will be, you know, 50 States

16

having different regulatory provisions regarding these

17

plans, plus the Federal regulations.

18

don't co-exist in consistent remedies?

19

And what if they

And so I think for those reasons, petitioner is

20

asking that Yates be declared a participant in this plan

21

and remand that for further proceedings.

22
23
24
25

If you have no further questions, I'll reserve
the rest of my time.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MATTHEW D. ROBERTS

5

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

6

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

7
8
9

MR. ROBERTS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
Hundreds of thousands of shareholders, partners,

10

and sole proprietors who work for the businesses they own

11

are currently covered by benefit plans that also cover

12

other employees.

13

owners are participants subject to the rights and remedies

14

of ERISA, just like the other employees in the plans.

15

that's clear from the text of ERISA which contains several

16

partial exemptions, which Mr. Holifield referred to some

17

of, for certain plans that cover working owners, and those

18

exemptions presuppose that working owners may be ERISA

19

participants.

20

All of those different types of working

And

In addition, working owners have long been

21

eligible to participate, along with other employees, in

22

pension plans qualifying for favorable tax treatment.

23

ERISA was intended to harmonize with those tax provisions

24

and it didn't revoke the ability of working owners to

25

participate in tax qualified plans.

And

14
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Coverage of working owners also furthers ERISA's

2

purposes of ensuring that employee benefit plans are

3

governed by a single set of regulations, of encouraging

4

plan creation, and of protecting plan participants.

5

there's no question that the other non-owner employees

6

that are covered by plans that also cover working owners

7

are participants subject to the rights and remedies of

8

ERISA.

9

So

And if the working owners in those plans were

10

not also ERISA participants, they would be subject to

11

different regulations and have different rights and

12

remedies than other employees in the same plan.

13

might even be prohibited from being covered by the plans

14

at all, and that result would place the coverage

15

provisions of title I of ERISA at war with the tax

16

provisions governing pension plans and with the insurance

17

provisions of title IV of ERISA, both of which cover plans

18

in which working owners participate along with other

19

employees.

They

QUESTION:

Mr. Roberts --

MR. ROBERTS:

No.

The -- the -- it's clear and

3

it's accepted in the opinions below that it is a qualified

plan for -- for tax purposes.

5

possibility that if -- if the working owner, Dr. Yates, is

6

not an ERISA participant under title I of ERISA, that

7

title I would prohibit him from being in the plan at all,

8

which would be a very anomalous situation because the tax

9

code is encouraging him to be in the plan along with other

But it -- there's a strong

10

employees.

11

the tax code encourages, and if it were a defined benefit

12

plan, which this one doesn't happen to be, it would in

13

fact be insured also under title IV of ERISA which insures

14

plans in which working owners participate along with other

15

employees.

16

And title I of ERISA would be prohibiting what

And in addition, allowing working owners to

17

participate along with other employees, as I was alluding

18

to before, advances ERISA's purpose of encouraging

19

employee benefit plans because the ability to participate

20

themselves gives working owners an incentive to establish

21

plans for other workers.

22

of scale in plan administration and investment and it

23

encourages owners to monitor the plans to ensure that

24

they're well managed and that they're well funded.

It also could create economies

can be participants in ERISA plans.

3

share that view, and it's entitled to substantial weight.

21

QUESTION:

I -- I have no desire for --

I just want to know what the

22

Government's position is in this.

23

is not Chevron.

24
25

As I understand it, it

You're just -- Skidmore.

MR. ROBERTS:

We're not asking -- we're not

asking for Chevron deference.

As the Chief Justice

pointed out, we think that it's --

2

QUESTION:

I want to know -- I don't care what

3

you're asking for.

You do not think it's entitled to

4

Chevron deference.

Is that right?

5

MR. ROBERTS:

We read Mead to say ordinarily --

6

particularly since in Christianson, the Court was

7

confronting an opinion letter from the Department of

8

Labor, I would hesitate to suggest that an opinion letter

9

from the Department of Labor here and a statute that is,

10

as far as I can tell, no different in how it treats

11

opinion letters, would be entitled to greater deference

12

than --

13
14

QUESTION:

Well, you have Udall v. Tallman, if

you want to go into it --

MR. ROBERTS:

16

QUESTION:

Well --

-- where it's interpreting its own

regs.
MR. ROBERTS:

That's a different -- yes.

Yes,

19

Your Honor.

20

Secretary's interpretation of her regulation as to limit

21

the definition of employee to only the regulation itself

22

and to not extend to the statute, on that point the

23

Secretary's interpretation of her own regulation is

24

controlling.

25

is also a Labor Department case.

On the question -- on the question of the

That would be Udall, Auer v. Robbins, which

1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

question about that as well.

2

One point I did want to make is that we would

3

urge the Court to make clear in its opinion that all types

4

of working owners, not just those that are common law

5

employees, are -- are eligible to be participants under

6

ERISA.

7

on that in the courts of appeals and the very reasons --

8

same reasons that justify the conclusion that sole

9

shareholders can be ERISA participants also justify the

And the reason for that is that there's confusion

10

conclusion that sole proprietors and partners who are not

11

common law employees, if they are working for the

12

businesses, may be ERISA participants.

13

QUESTION:

You -- you keep stressing working for

14

the businesses.

15

question I asked Mr. Holifield about suppose you have a

16

single shareholder, 100 percent owner, but that doesn't

17

work in the business.

18

What -- what is your answer to the

MR. ROBERTS:

As a general matter, I think that

19

person could not be covered as a -- a participant.

20

person might be designated by a participant as a -- as a

21

beneficiary or in certain circumstances designated by the

22

plan as a beneficiary in connection with a participant in

23

the plan who was an -- an employee.

24

employee for ERISA is the same definition as under 401 of

25

the Internal Revenue Code which is common law employees

The

But the definition of

plus self-employed individuals who are people that are

2

providing personal services to the business and getting

3

earned income.

Responds to Your Honor.

4

If there are no further questions, we would ask

5

that the judgment of the court of appeals be reversed and

6

remanded.

7

QUESTION:

If -- I just have one question.

If

8

-- if we follow your suggestion for the writing of the

9

opinion, how do you suggest we explain and cite Clackamas

10
11

County?
MR. ROBERTS:

Well, in -- in Clackamas, the

12

Court followed the same approach that the Court followed

13

in Darden.

14

to the statute.

And the first step in that approach is to look

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. ROBERTS:

Look at the statute.
And so we would say Clackamas just

17

doesn't come in because you look to the statute.

18

statute makes clear that all the types of working owners

19

can be covered, Your Honor.

1

Justice Breyer, we -- we address this issue at

2

the very level that you -- you talked about, that first

3

common law level, and we think an important distinction

4

should be made in this case that this case is not about

5

working owners.

6

shareholder, a sole shareholder.

7

a substantial difference when you get down to the basics

8

of an organization and -- and you look at the fiduciary

9

duties a president, a director has to a corporation and

10

you look at the fact that when you have one shareholder,

11

there's one person that that duty is enforceable by, and

12

that's the same person that it applies to.

This case is about one working
And we think that makes

13

On the other hand, in this -- in this Court's

14

opinion in Clackamas, you had four shareholders, and no

15

matter what their interests were, those shareholders all

16

had fiduciary rights and expectations between themselves

17

and all had the right to enforce those fiduciary

18

obligations amongst them.

19

control that those other shareholders have when -- when

20

you try to separate one down.

21

So there is some element of

in this corporation.

Which -- what is it?
-- in this case because --

No, no.

What is not in this case.

What is it in general?
MR. TROUTMAN:

Well, in general you're -- you're

correct that -- that you would be -QUESTION:

All right.

If I'm correct in

general, then what is it about this -MR. TROUTMAN:

Okay.

In this case and in the

Clackamas case, the Court looked at what the common law

22
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

considers an employee.

2

law concepts of control in a master/servant relationship

3

and when you get down to breaking down and applying the

4

elements that are referenced in the Darden case, that all

5

of these -- all of these elements, when you're applying

6

them to Dr. Yates, will indicate that as sole shareholder

7

he is more considered an employer than he is an employee.

8
9

QUESTION:

And we think when you apply common

When you talk about control, Mr.

Troutman, you're talking about two different people

10

basically.

11

Here there is only one.

12

MR. TROUTMAN:

How much control does one have over the other.

That's correct, Your Honor, and

13

that's why we think that when you have sole shareholders

14

and when you -- and when you're dealing with trying to

15

apply a control to only one, it's almost an anomaly.

16

-- and --

17
18
19

QUESTION:

And

Well, but you -- you think then that

a sole shareholder for that reason cannot be an employee?
MR. TROUTMAN:

We think that for purposes of

20

ERISA, when ERISA is trying to determine whether a person

21

is an employee and an employer and where we're not given

22

much guidance by the statute, we don't think these --

23

number one, we don't think these other statutory

24

provisions give us guidance with a sole shareholder.

25

we think a distinction should be made within this category

And

of working owners between sole proprietors and -- and sole

shareholders.

3

context in general, an employee may constitute or consist

4

of an -- of a sole shareholder, when -- when you're trying

5

to separate that person out under ERISA and plug that

person into one of those definitions under ERISA --

7

And so while in -- in the common law

QUESTION:

Why does it have to be one

he also be an employee?

Certainly Yates is an employer, but why can't
Why -- am I right that you seem

10

to think it's got to be one or the other?

11

both?

12

MR. TROUTMAN:

It can't be

We think under Darden -- yes,

13

Justice Ginsburg.

14

apply the factors that are listed in the Darden case, the

15

control, the -- the providing of the instrumentalities,

16

the right to direct the work of other employees, we think

17

that that results in this instance with the sole

18

shareholder of classifying him as an employer, not an

19

employee.

20

We think under Darden that when you

QUESTION:

Well, he is an employer.

There's no

21

question about that.

22

this purpose just as he is for taxes on workers like

23

Social Security and unemployment compensation?

24
25

But why can't he be an employee for

MR. TROUTMAN:

Well, I -- I guess under that --

under that scenario then we would need to look at perhaps

24
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

what the employer -- how the -- how the particular person

2

is acting under the plan.

3

about is he taking money out of his paycheck and deducting

4

-- and contributing under ERISA, perhaps he's an employee.

5

Is, on the other hand, he -- exercising his -- his

6

investment decisions as trustee, does he then come under

7

the definition of employer as someone acting on his

8

behalf?

9

And if -- if we're talking

Or in this instance, we have the -- we have the

10

debt that existed for -- for many years and contrary to

11

the specific terms of the plan, that debt was not repaid

12

by a specific --

13

QUESTION:

But that's an issue that everyone

14

agrees is open, that even -- even if he's classified as an

15

employee, the creditors may have priority over the plan

16

with respect to that $50,000.

17

MR. TROUTMAN:

Yes, I agree with that, but what

18

I was going -- what I was -- what I was leading to was

19

that when he failed to make those quarterly deductions

20

that are required by the plan, he -- that more couches him

21

in terms of an employer because he's the -- he's got his

22

employer hat on, in other words, because he's the one that

23

would control what deductions come out of employees' pay

24

or not.

25

-- this case.

And -- and we think that's the very heart of this
And so if he's acting in that capacity,

He'd still be something I assume.

11

QUESTION:

That -- that's true, but we're --

12
13

But no.

But --

we're asking what his status is.
MR. TROUTMAN:

I understand.

But now, there's

14

also -- we also make the point that perhaps there can be

15

participation under the plan, but that doesn't necessarily

16

elevate him to this protected status as a participant.

17

Under the Internal Revenue provisions, he is permitted to

18

participate under this plan, but the IRS -- I mean, the --

19

ERISA distinguishes between an employer and an employee in

those -- in those definitions.

We think that

We don't think so.

We think under the Harris County

refer to this broad class of working owners, and we think

that there is a substantial difference between sole

MR. TROUTMAN:

Partners would be the same way we

think because obviously you're going to have more than one

MR. TROUTMAN:

No.

We think -- well, no.

Yes,

we would agree that if there's two or more, that that

distinguishes the situation from this case where you have

17

one sole person involved.

18

employees and deemed participants under -- under ERISA.

19

QUESTION:

So, yes, partners could be

But you don't just have one person

20

involved.

21

is a person and you have a human person?

22

really two people involved.

23

Isn't it correct you have a corporation which

MR. TROUTMAN:

So there are

You do, but you only have -- but

24

that -- that corporation, that legal fictional entity, can

25

only act through a human person, and there's only one

owes those fiduciary duties to the corporation, but as

3

sole shareholder, you know, in essence they're owed to

4

him.

5

Dr. Yates, as president or director,

So he -- there's no way to enforce those back.
QUESTION:

Well, the -- you know, you're -- if

6

-- you can't be appealing to the common law then if -- if

7

we're going to get the meaning of employee from the common

8

law.

9

like that.

The common law doesn't pierce the corporate veil

10

MR. TROUTMAN:

11

QUESTION:

No, it doesn't.

You establish a corporation and

12

there's the corporation and there's the employee.

13

fact that the employee happens to be a shareholder of the

14

corporation would have no relevance at common law.

15

MR. TROUTMAN:

16

QUESTION:

That's right.

We're appealing --

So you're arguing something apart

17

from common law, something based on what?

18

the purposes of ERISA?

19

And the

MR. TROUTMAN:

Based on the --

Yes, based on the purposes of

20

ERISA and based on this Court's opinion in the Clackamas

21

case where -- where it looked beyond the corporate

22

structure of the -- of the four shareholders there.

23

-- and in the -- in the footnote it specifically said that

24

-- of course, we had the EEOC guidelines of control and --

25

and all the others, but -- but the Court went beyond the

Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

corporate veil there to say that these four shareholders

2

under the common law may more likely be classified as

3

employers than employee, at least under the ADA.

4

QUESTION:

But -- but that was because the

5

statute was, we thought in Clackamas, silent on the point,

6

and the Government's argument is that the statute is

7

controlling here.

8

MR. TROUTMAN:

The Government is arguing that

9

the statute is different in the -- from both Darden and

10

Clackamas in that it indicates that employees may -- or

11

that working owners may participate.

12

is two things.

Our response to that

13

One, when you break it down to sole shareholders

14

and go back to the purposes of ERISA, you know, the owners

15

of the -- employers were not who ERISA -- Congress was

16

trying to protect.

It was the employees.

17

Secondly, when you look at other provisions like

18

the definition of an employer that says someone working on

19

his -- on behalf of the employee -- when you look at

20

sections 1052, 1053 of ERISA that clearly seem to

21

distinguish between an employer and employee, we submit

22

there are other inferences that may be drawn that perhaps

23

the same person cannot function in two different

24

capacities under ERISA.

25

QUESTION:

I mean, I don't understand what -- I

30
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

thought ERISA is to protect employees --

MR. TROUTMAN:

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. TROUTMAN:

5

QUESTION:

That's correct.

-- let's say, other than the owner.
That's correct.

All right?

So we put some of them in

6

the program, and then ERISA says, and by the way, if you

7

have a program like that, the owner can participate in it

8

too just like an employee.

9

purpose, to make sure you have some employees, and then if

So that seems to be the

10

you do, you let the owners and the executives, everybody

11

else involved can become as participants if they're

12

members or former members of the organization at least.

13

So if that's the purpose, how does this defeat the

14

purpose?

15

participate.

16

There are some other members and he wants to

MR. TROUTMAN:

If the -- we submit that what

17

this doctor -- what Dr. Yates is here as a sole

18

shareholder is more akin to an employer than an employee

19

and that when you start combining his interests with those

20

of other employees, that you start to muddy the purpose of

21

the congressional intent --

22

QUESTION:

No, no, no.

I'm just talking in

23

terms of purposes.

24

language, what they say is, A, the common law would have

25

considered him an employee of the corporation.

If you're talking in terms of

B, we have

31
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

the tax code which says -- doesn't happen to throw him in

2

as a member or former member.

3

because it says he's an employee.

4

Benefit Guaranty code which again refers to him as an

5

employee, and then we have the language of the reg itself

6

which says he's not deemed an employee for purposes of

7

this section, words which wouldn't have been necessary if

8

he fell -- didn't fall within it in the first place.

9

then it says, for purposes of this section, which

It says he's a participant
We have the Pension

And

10

certainly suggests that it could mean just purposes of

11

this section, otherwise he's in it.

12

we have that's what the Labor Department thinks.

13
14
15

All right.

And just to top it,

Now, that seems like a pretty good

set of considerations.
MR. TROUTMAN:

I understand.

I -- I would say

16

that under title IV, Justice Breyer, also the same

17

language is there:

18

defines a substantial owner.

19

limiting language that's in the CFR is also in the

20

provisions of title IV, and -- and as the petitioner

21

correctly points out in their brief, title IV does not

22

apply here.

23

for purposes of this section.

Then it

So we submit the same

So we think the policies of ERISA are -- are

24

furthered when you separate the two and you -- you know,

25

where Congress has intended to -- to protect employees,

32
Alderson Reporting Company, Inc.
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

and we think when the other provisions of the statute are

2

examined, that -- that this one person cannot occupy these

3

two positions of employer and employee.

4

QUESTION:

But as far as the tax exempt part of

5

the plan, that's okay.

6

Mr. Roberts that question.

8

MR. TROUTMAN:

You agree with -- I think I asked

You did, Justice Ginsburg, and we

don't think there's any tax effect here by this decision.

9

QUESTION:

On the point that would be left over

10

for remand, that is in any event, this was a -- was an

11

unlawful preference, was that something that you raised

12

below?

13

MR. TROUTMAN:

We did.

In fact, Your Honor,

14

that was the very first thing we raised and that was the

15

first issue we focused on and the -- the bankruptcy court

16

instead chose this issue to rule on and pretermitted the

17

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JAMES A. HOLIFIELD

13

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

14

Thank you, Mr. Troutman.

MR. HOLIFIELD:

Your Honor, I would just -- just

15

point out just a couple quick points here, and that is,

16

there's nothing in ERISA that prevents a person from being

17

or playing or acting in multiple roles.

18

contemplated all throughout ERISA and it's in the briefs.

19

Matter of fact, there's nothing preventing Yates PC from

employer, and the definition of persons specifically

7

includes individual, partnerships, joint ventures,

corporations, unincorporated organizations, associations,

employee organizations, mutual companies, this -- this

person.

to participate in this plan based on the other regulatory
