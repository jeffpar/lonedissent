ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. SALMONS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The officers in this case went to respondent's

12

apartment on a weekday afternoon to execute a valid search

13

warrant for drugs.

14

their purpose.

15

without hearing any response and then forcibly entered the

16

apartment.

17

Amendment.

18

They knocked loudly and announced

They waited at least 15 to 20 seconds

Those actions were reasonable under the Fourth

The Ninth Circuit concluded otherwise based on

19

its adoption of a rigid, four-part categorical approach to

20

knock and announce cases that is fundamentally at odds

21

with this Court's precedents in two critical respects.

22

First, it is inconsistent with the flexibility that is an

23

essential feature of this Court's totality of the

24

circumstances test, and second, it turns primarily on the

25

need to damage some property in order to effectuate an

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

entry, a factor that under this Court's reasoning in

2

Ramirez should have no relevance to whether the entry at a

3

particular time was itself lawful.
QUESTION:

4
5

Did the court here say that these

were the only -- the only four factors?
MR. SALMONS:

6

No, Your Honor.

What the court

7

here did -- and I would refer the Court to -- to page, I

8

believe, 6a of the appendix to the petition for

9

certiorari, actually beginning on page 5a.

What the court

10

does is it first creates four basic categories of knock

11

and announce cases, and those categories are defined by

12

two factors, one being the presence of exigent

13

circumstances and the other being the need to damage

14

property.
And then on page 6a, what it does is its says

15
16

that the essential question of whether the entry was

17

reasonable is approached in the following way.

18

characterize -- and this is the first full paragraph on

19

page 6a.

20

entries as either forced or non-forced, meaning either

21

property is damaged or not damaged.

22

must then be determined in light of the totality of the

23

circumstances.

24

factors that it thinks are relevant.

25

First, we

In addressing that inquiry, we characterize

The reasonableness

Now, the court does list a number of

QUESTION:

And -- and it says that -- that those

26

4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

factors are not exclusive.

2

include but are not limited to.

3

MR. SALMONS:

They say they're -- they

That's correct, Your Honor.

And

4

we take no issue with its list of non-exclusive factors in

5

terms of whether those factors are relevant to the

6

question under the totality of the circumstances test.

7

The difficulty we have with the Ninth Circuit's approach

8

in this case is that it has engrafted a rigid property

9

destruction rule onto the Fourth Amendment's flexible

10

standard of reasonableness and onto this Court's totality

11

of the circumstances test.

12

In other words, what the court of appeals does

13

is it requires that where an entry is non-forcible, again

14

meaning no property need be destroyed, then the officers

15

must wait a significant amount of time before entry.

16

where some property damage is required, it would require,

17

quote, an explicit refusal of admittance or the lapse of

18

an even more substantial amount of time.

19

But

And we think that that both is inconsistent with

20

the totality of the circumstances standard because it

21

imposes this rigid rule of property damage, and it's

22

inconsistent with Ramirez which makes clear that the need

23

to damage property, although it's certainly relevant to

24

the ultimate question of whether the manner of the

25

execution of the warrant is reasonable under the Fourth

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

Amendment, it's not a relevant inquiry into whether the

2

entry at a particular time is itself lawful.

3

QUESTION:

Doesn't -- excuse me.

4

QUESTION:

Go ahead.

5

QUESTION:

No, please.

6

QUESTION:

I just had this -- I was just curious

7

about one aspect of property damage and so forth.

8

citizen's property is damaged by this, who pays for the

9

damage?

10

MR. SALMONS:

If a

Well, Your Honor, there is --

11

there is a statute that Congress has enacted and that is

12

31 U.S.C. 3724, and that authorizes the Attorney General

13

to pay out sums of money up to, I believe, $50,000 to pay

14

for any damage to property that may result from law

15

enforcement activities.

16

as I understand it, Your Honor, is that there is a

17

significant fund set up based on forfeiture assets, and

18

that those funds are used to pay for damage to property

19

that may result during the course of -- of a search or --

20

or other law enforcement activities.

21

The way that it typically works,

Typically what happens is the law enforcement

22

officers will not leave the premises until it is at least

23

secured, and then they provide forms or other information

24

so that individuals can make claims --

25

QUESTION:

I see.

MR. SALMONS:

-- for any property that is

2

damaged.

And -- and at least with regard to Federal law

3

enforcement practices, those claims are readily paid out

4

and there are funds to do so through the forfeiture

5

proceeds.
QUESTION:

6

Of course, that would have -- that

7

would not apply.

This was really a State search rather

8

than a Federal search even though it was -MR. SALMONS:

9

This was a joint search, Your

Honor.

This was a -- the -- the search was conducted by a

11

joint task force.

information would be provided.

fact the -- the person is arrested and is there and is --

you get paid only if you're innocent?

MR. SALMONS:

It -- it depends, Your Honor.

2

There are -- there are factors that are considered.

3

-- I'm not entirely sure of -- of what all of them are.

4

If there is -- I would -- my understanding is that if

5

there is -- certainly if there was another individual that

6

lives in the home or -- or otherwise, that even though the

7

entry was -- was reasonable and the need to destroy or

8

damage property was reasonable, if there were other people

9

in the home, the officer -- the -- the Federal law

10

enforcement officials typically pay that.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SALMONS:

13

I'm

Well -And even when there's not, they

often do as well.
QUESTION:

14

Well, this is a background issue, and

15

-- and I don't mean to take you away from talking about

16

the Ninth Circuit's case in response to Justice Scalia's

17

question.
QUESTION:

18

Mr. Salmons, may I ask you one

19

question on -- on your timing point?

Your claim is that

20

the -- that the issue of property damage is irrelevant to

21

the question of reasonable timing as distinct from

22

reasonable execution.

23

are dealing with a situation in which there is an -- an

24

exigency, a set of circumstances that said you've got to

25

act fast.

I understand your argument when we

26

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

My question, though, goes to the situation in

2

which there is no exigency.

You're -- you're executing a

3

warrant for -- to seize a stolen grand piano or something.

4

No property is going to be destroyed if you wait a little

5

bit longer.

6

at the beginning, none develops while you're waiting,

7

doesn't the issue of property damage have some relevance

8

to the question of timing?

9

risk that anything is going away, isn't it reasonable for

In that case, where there is no exigency, not

In other words, if there's no

10

the police to say, okay, give them another minute or

11

something like that?

12

MR. SALMONS:

We submit, no, Your Honor, and for

13

the following reason, that in -- typically the -- the

14

standard would -- that would be applied in this kind of a

15

context would be whether the officers had waited

16

sufficiently long so that they could reasonably conclude

17

that there was a constructive denial of admittance or

18

that, as you indicate, other law enforcement -- excuse me

19

-- other law enforcement concerns may justify a more

20

prompt entry.

21

In the hypothetical that you gave, none of those

22

other law enforcement concerns are present, and so the

23

question then, we submit, would be whether the officers

24

could reasonably conclude that they had been

25

constructively denied admittance.

And there, the need to

26

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

damage some property, if it exists at all, is a

2

consequence of the denial of admittance, not a factor as

3

to whether the denial had in fact occurred.
QUESTION:

4

But when -- when you're dealing --

5

let's -- let's take the case in which the exigency

6

develops while you're waiting.

7

reasonable to -- to suspect that you are being denied

8

admittance, let's say, in a case where drugs are easily

9

disposable is that there is good reason to believe that

10

somebody would -- another 10 or 20 or whatever seconds

11

will use the 20 seconds to get rid of the drugs, if

12

possible.

13

of a conclusion in the grand piano case, and there --

14

there is less reason to believe, less reason to suspect

15

that you are actually being denied admittance as opposed

16

to simply being the victim of somebody who's slow at

17

getting the -- to the door.

18

reasoning?

19

One reason why it is

You don't have any basis for drawing that kind

MR. SALMONS:

Isn't that a fair line of

I mean, I think the distinction

20

Your Honor makes between those types of cases is a

21

legitimate one.

22

need to damage property is really not a factor that goes

23

into whether entry at a particular time was reasonable

24

under the circumstances.

25

-- excuse me.

We still think though, however, that the

It's a consequence of the denial

It's a consequence of the occupant's

QUESTION:

But -- but maybe --

3

QUESTION:

Are there -- are there guidebooks?

4

Is there any manual that Federal law enforcement officers

5

use that will say in -- in a knock and announce situation,

6

these are the relevant factors?

7

time span that would be appropriate?
MR. SALMONS:

8

Do they suggest a time, a

Your Honor, there is training that

9

occurs, although to my understanding, there's not a

10

specific amount of time that's -- that's provided to

11

officers that they need to wait as some sort of minimum.

12

Rather, consistent with this Court's cases, the -- the

13

guidelines and -- and the training that's conducted

14

teaches the officers that they must take into account the

15

totality of the circumstances.

16

like how large of -- of a dwelling it is, what time of day

17

it is.

18

QUESTION:

That would include factors

But there's nothing -- nothing

19

written down that suggests how many seconds, no manual

20

that Federal law enforcement --

21

MR. SALMONS:

To my knowledge, that is correct.

22

The -- it used to be the case, as I understand it, that

23

there was a suggested amount of time and that was 30

24

seconds when there are no other law enforcement concerns

25

that are at issue, but that currently the training that is

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

conducted just focuses on the totality of the

2

circumstances and that they need to wait a reasonable

3

period of time, and if there are no other law enforcement

4

concerns at issue, then that reasonable period of time is

5

typically considered to be how long it would take to

6

conclude that you were constructively denied admittance -QUESTION:

7
8

there are other law enforcement concerns.
MR. SALMONS:

9
10

But not if there are -- but not if

That's correct.

If there are

other concerns -QUESTION:

11

I mean, what troubles me is you --

12

you can't simply announce that -- that the rule is you

13

wait a reasonable amount -- what -- what constitutes a

14

reasonable of time is how long it would be expected

15

someone would take to get to the door.

16

adopt that as your uniform rule because otherwise, you'd

17

have to use the same amount of time whether there are

18

exigent circumstances or not.

19

MR. SALMONS:

20

QUESTION:

21

That -- that --

If it takes 20 seconds usually, it

takes 20 seconds.
MR. SALMONS:

You -- you can't

Honor.

QUESTION:

That isn't quite right.

QUESTION:

7

9

No.

No.

Absolutely.

I'm just saying the exigent

circumstances would not alter what is a reasonable time.
MR. SALMONS:

And that's why we submit that the

relevant question is not just how long it would take for a

10

person under those circumstances to get to the door.

11

-- the analysis must take into account as well valid law

12

enforcement concerns.

13

all this illustrates is what this Court has repeatedly

said, which is this is a contextual analysis that has to

be based on the totality of the circumstances.

reasonable person to get to the door.
MR. SALMONS:

10

That -- that's -- that is my

11

understanding, Your Honor, and I think that's exactly

12

right.

I would also -QUESTION:

13

Mr. Salmons, are you relying on

14

exigent circumstances here because it was a drug case or

15

not?

16

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, in this case, let me

17

begin by pointing out that we submit that the 15 to 20

18

seconds that the officers delayed in this case is a

19

substantial amount of time.

20

nowhere close to the constitutional line.

21

QUESTION:

And it's no -- it's really

Well, could you answer my question?

22

Are you relying?

23

do you want us to treat this as an exigent circumstance

that --

QUESTION:

3

MR. SALMONS:

4

Okay.
-- by your question you're

referring --

5

QUESTION:

That's what I'm asking.

6

MR. SALMONS:

The only reason I hesitated is

7

because I think the term exigent circumstances can be a

8

bit ambiguous, and this is not a case where the Government

9

has suggested that the officers were entitled to forego

10

knocking and announcing at any point in the process.

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. SALMONS:

13

This was a small apartment, was it?
Yes.

This was a small apartment.

It was in the middle of the afternoon.

14

QUESTION:

What size?

15

MR. SALMONS:

It was a two-bedroom apartment.

16

I'm not sure of the square footage.

17

diagrams of the apartment in the joint appendix.

18

testimony of the officers was that it was sufficiently

19

small that the officers located in the back of the

20

apartment could hear the knock and announce at the front

21

door.
QUESTION:

22

There are some
The

occupant says, wait a minute, I'm in the shower, I'm

MR. SALMONS:

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

factor that would then go under the totality of the

2

circumstances standard.

3

are a lot of other things that the officers would have to

4

consider, including whether they're being truthful,

5

whether they can hear water running, whether there's still

6

a risk that they may have drugs with them in the shower,

7

dumping them down the drain.
QUESTION:

8
9

Whether or not -- I mean, there

But in response to Justice O'Connor's

question, there are no exigent circumstances of the type

10

that would eliminate the need to knock and announce at

11

all.
MR. SALMONS:

12
13
14

That's correct, but there are

still -QUESTION:

Are you going to go on to say that

15

there are some other exigent circumstances that are in the

16

background here that --

17

MR. SALMONS:

18

QUESTION:

19
20

Well, certainly --

-- that counsel against waiting more

than 20 seconds?
MR. SALMONS:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

In fact,

21

even though there may not be sufficient concerns about

22

officer safety or the destruction of evidence to forego

23

knocking and announcing altogether, those are still valid

24

law enforcement concerns in the context of a case like

25

this where the officers are there to execute a warrant for

26

16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

drugs.

The officers are -- have strong evidence that

2

there are, in fact, drugs in the apartment.

3

controlled buy not long before they went to execute the

4

warrant, and there is the risk at a minimum of the

5

destruction of evidence, and that those are factors that

6

have to be taken into account.

7

QUESTION:

They did a

And that would be true in almost any

8

drug case where the officers know that drugs are in -- are

9

-- are in the premises or have reason to believe that

10
11

drugs are in the premises.
MR. SALMONS:

Certainly I think the potential

12

for that concern is present in almost all -- and not just

13

drug cases, but any case where the -- the evidence to be

14

sought through the search is subject to -- to readily

15

destruction and --

16

QUESTION:

And you say that's not enough to

17

forego knock and announce, but it is enough to shorten the

18

time period that you have to wait.

19

MR. SALMONS:

Yes, Your Honor, that -- that it's

20

not enough to -- at least in the context of this case,

21

that there was not enough reasonable suspicion of those

22

concerns to forego knocking and announcing altogether, but

23

those factors still have to be taken into account under

24

the totality of the circumstances in evaluating whether

25

the officers here waited a reasonable period of time.

No.

We're not suggesting some rigid rule that applies in all

What we're suggesting is that as part of the

10

totality of the circumstances, it -- it must be the case

Souter's question earlier pointed out, in a case where

2

there are no concerns that would -- that would warrant a

3

more prompt entry, we think the question is whether a

reasonable officer could conclude that he had been

constructively denied admittance.

are those concerns, even if they don't rise to the level

of foregoing knocking and announcing altogether --

This Court has never felt that the -- that the terms of

MR. SALMONS:

explanation, which is this Court has recognized that what

this statute does is it filled a gap.

16

historical explanation that this statute filled a gap that

17

then existed in Federal law because this Court had not

18

incorporated or -- or subsumed the common law principles

19

of knock and announce into the Fourth Amendment and many

20

States had.

21

Court reaffirmed this in Ramirez not long ago, that what

22

the statute does is it codifies the common law tradition

of knock and announce, and that includes all the

exceptions to knock and announce.

statute that says they cannot come in unless he refuses

the police admittance?

MR. SALMONS:

And he hasn't.
Right.

You point out a very good

I don't think it's a good point at

to make, Your Honor --

3

QUESTION:

4

MR. SALMONS:

The -- the point I was attempting

That's refusing admittance.
The point I was attempting to

5

make, Your Honor was that what this Court has recognized

6

repeatedly, and it said in Ramirez it was now decisively

7

holding and resolving the question, and that is that the

8

statute here, 3109, is not to be read literally but merely

9

is to be read as a codification of the common law

10

tradition of knock and announce.

11

indicated in its decision in Wilson, that common law

12

tradition is a flexible one, and it's one --

13

QUESTION:

And as this Court

Does that flexibility mean that there

14

really isn't this bright line between exigent and

15

nonexigent?

16

not exigent enough to do away with the knock and announce,

17

there is then a difference between the case Justice Souter

18

posed of the grand piano and the warrant is to search for

19

drugs which could easily be -- be disposed of.

exigencies in this case to justify foregoing knocking and

permitted to take into account the risks inherent in

executing a warrant in this kind of a context, including

5

the risk of destroying of that -QUESTION:

6

May I ask this question?

Does a

citizen have a right to make sure that they're really

9

like that?

Could he -- could a citizen come to the door

10

and say, slide the warrant under the door and I'll look at

11

it and I'll let you in if I think you're genuine?

22

It's somebody who wants to hold up the house,

MR. SALMONS:

purposes of the knock and announce rule, Your Honor, is to

provide notice to the occupants that it is the police that

25

are attempting to come in so that it increases public

2

occupants.

3

QUESTION:

What time did this take place?

4

MR. SALMONS:

5

Wednesday afternoon, Your Honor.

This took place at 2 o'clock on a

I think one of the remarkable things about the

6
7

Ninth Circuit's decision in this case is that the

8

officers' delay here really was nowhere close to the

9

constitutional line.

15 to 20 seconds is a substantial

10

delay.

Even if this Court were to conclude this case

11

based only on the question of whether they had been

12

constructively denied admittance, we think these other

13

factors warranted a prompter entry here.
And in fact, the testimony of the officers in

14

The officer from the Nevada

15

this case suggests that.

16

police that was at the front door stated that he waited a

17

long time in this case because he thought there was some

18

chance that the case may go to Federal court, and he

19

wanted to make sure that there were no knock and announce

20

concerns.

21

The FBI agent at the back of the -- of the

22

apartment testified that he -- he became concerned about

23

the length of the delay.

24

long and stated that he was concerned that the occupant

25

might be attempting to flee from another way.

He described it as unusually

26

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY
1111 14th Street, N.W. Suite 400 1-800-FOR-DEPO Washington, DC 20005

1

This is simply not a case that's close to the

2

line, and for the Ninth Circuit to hold that the officers

3

in this case were required to wait some additional period

4

of time that's unspecified, in addition to the 15 to 20

5

seconds, really does pose threats to law enforcement

6

officials engaged in the front-line law enforcement

7

activities in the jurisdictions covered by the Ninth

8

Circuit.
QUESTION:

9

Going back to Justice Scalia's

10

initial question, the Ninth Circuit opinion is wrong

11

because?

12

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, the Ninth Circuit

13

opinion is wrong because it adopts a rigid property

14

destruction rule and engrafts it onto the totality of the

15

circumstances test.

16

enough to be consistent with the totality of the

17

circumstances test and, two, is inconsistent with this

18

Court's decision in Ramirez which indicated that the

19

question of the timing of an entry is distinct from the

20

question of the manner in which the entry and the warrant

21

itself are executed.

22

well constitute a violation of the Fourth Amendment if it

23

is needless or wanton, but that, as this Court said in

24

Ramirez, does not make the entry unlawful and it doesn't

25

require suppression.

QUESTION:

Do you -- do you think that the

dissenting judge Fisher got it essentially right?
MR. SALMONS:

Well, certainly we think that

4

Judge Fisher was correct when he indicated that one of his

5

concerns about the court of appeals -- the panel's

6

decision in this case was that it didn't follow its own

7

list of factors.

8
9

We also think Judge Fisher was correct when he
indicated that all one needs do is do a thought experiment

10

and think to yourself, police, search warrant, and count

11

out 15 to 20 seconds to see how long a period of time this

12

really was.

13

QUESTION:

Do you -- do you say that the -- the

14

property line is improper only when there are exigent

15

circumstances or in all situations?

16

MR. SALMONS:

Your Honor, we submit that it is

17

not relevant to the question of the timing of the entry in

18

all circumstances.

19

QUESTION:

You mean a -- a police officer

20

shouldn't wait any longer before he rips my door down,

21

leaving the house exposed to -- to burglars than he --

22

than he has to wait when that isn't necessary, when the

door is open and he can just walk in?

Honor, and let me explain why.

3

QUESTION:

Why isn't that part of the totality

of the circumstances?
MR. SALMONS:

The reason we think, one, flows

4

from this Court's decision in Ramirez where the Court

5

differentiated between the timing of the entry and the

6

need to damage property.

7

And two, it's important to keep in mind what the

8

officers in that situation have to take into account.

9

They're -- they're waiting and they have to -- they have

10

to consider how long they have to wait to either conclude

11

that they've been constructively denied admittance --

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SALMONS:

14
15

Right.
-- or that there are valid law

enforcement concerns that require entry at that time.
QUESTION:

I'm -- I'm excluding the latter.

I'm

16

saying there are no other exigent circumstances, not even

17

the -- the moderate exigent circumstances that are not

18

enough to enable you to go in without knock and announce.

19

There are just no other exigent circumstances.

20

MR. SALMONS:

21

QUESTION:

Your Honor, in that case --

There's no reason whatever.

All

22

they're looking for is how long is it reasonable to wait

23

for me to come to the door.

24

me it is just as reasonable for them to have to wait only

25

15 seconds when their entry simply requires walking in and

3

of totality of the circumstances.

4

MR. SALMONS:

That doesn't seem to me to be a -- an application

Your Honor, we would disagree

5

because, first of all, it's -- it's going to be -- it's

6

often going to be the case that the officer, at the time

7

he makes the decision that he's been constructively denied

8

admittance, doesn't know whether the door is locked or

9

not, and he really can't be put in a position where he has

10

to check the doors and windows to see whether any are

11

unlocked before he's allowed to enter.

12

warrant that authorizes him to go in, forcibly if

13

necessary, secure the premises and search for the evidence

14

covered by the warrant.

15

fact that the door happened to be locked or unlocked is

16

really not a factor that the officers can take into

17

account at that stage of the process.
QUESTION:

says I don't want to see you, it's right for them to bash

9

MR. SALMONS:

Again, Your Honor, we think the

relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable officer could

10

conclude that he had been constructively denied

11

admittance.

12

QUESTION:

13

MR. SALMONS:

14

hypothetical, he probably could.

15
16

QUESTION:

Exactly, and if that's -And it seems to me under your

That's why

I put it that way.

MR. SALMONS:

QUESTION:

And so --

If that is the only question that you

19

ask, I think you are taking a very narrow view of totality

20

of circumstance.

21

MR. SALMONS:

Well, again, Your Honor, in -- in

22

-- I see my time is almost up.

We think that flows from

23

the principle this Court followed in Ramirez that the

24

timing of the entry needs to be separated from the manner

25

in which the entry and the search is conducted.

That's

ORAL ARGUMENT OF RANDALL J. ROSKE

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9
10

MR. ROSKE:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

this Court:
This case is about whether your door, my door,

11

and everyone's door is worth 15 seconds.

12

presents the component of the knock and announce statute

13

that's the refusal component that this Court has not

14

addressed previously in any of its decisions.

15

This case

In Wilson, you said that this rule is of

16

constitutional magnitude, and in the Wisconsin v. Richards

17

case, you said there can be no blanket exceptions to knock

18

and announce just based on the -- the kind of case it is.

19

And then we see in Ramirez the Court talks about 3109 and

20

-- and so we see a line of cases where from Miller where

21

we were dealing with sort of an oversight of the -- the

22

from a Federal standpoint --

Ramirez noted that there were all kinds of indications and

8

evidence known to the officers of the person, the suspect,

the fugitive that they were looking for being armed,

10

dangerous, likely to resist forcibly the officers, and

11

officer safety exceptions --

2

residence, and they had developed information that this

3

individual was, however, staying at the Ramirez residence.
QUESTION:

4

One thing I thought that the Ninth

5

Circuit opinion really was contrary to Ramirez was its

6

stress on property damage, which -- which Ramirez made

7

quite clear was not determinative.
MR. ROSKE:

8
9

Well, I think that the circuit,

Ninth Circuit, has focused on property damage as, you

10

know, we have a statute that talks about breaking, and it

11

sees that in -- in the context of delay as requiring more

12

time.

13

QUESTION:

Well, we also have an opinion, e.g.,

14

Ramirez, which the Ninth Circuit didn't even cite, which

15

says that property damage is not controlling.

16

MR. ROSKE:

Well, and that's true and I -- I

17

concede that is so.

And I would submit to the Court that

18

you can decide that those guideposts cited by the Ninth

19

Circuit are flat wrong and reach the ground there that it

20

is entirely reasonable under a totality of the

21

circumstance test that you affirm the decision.

22

do a decision saying that the guideposts are simply wrong

under Ramirez, but the result under a totality of the

24

circumstances test is correct.

No, but that's the kind of -Well, then -- then of what relevance

MR. ROSKE:

We don't know and we don't care

Right.

But the -- but the point of

activities where that would cause someone to be unable to

QUESTION:

First, just a quibble.

But I read

12

the lower court as saying 15 to 20 seconds, and I take it

13

as 20 seconds because given that statement, had this been

14

20 seconds, they would have said it was unlawful.

15

if in fact you concede that 20 seconds is too long, then I

16

guess I'd have to reverse or is -- you know.

17

what I want -- I'm -- I'm taking the outer limit of what

18

they said.

19

And so

So -- so

Now, on that, I want to be sure I've got a

20

complete answer from you because I was pushing you, and so

21

far I've said all the circuits say 15 to 20 seconds is

22

certainly enough time for the policemen to wait where it's

23

a drug case, a small house, and you could easily get rid

24

of the evidence.

25

thought that 15 seconds -- but you should say 20 -- is --

In response to that, you said that you

is actually -- they have to wait that long.

2

anything other than your opinion, which I respect, but --

3

but what I'd like to know is whether there is any basis in

4

authority or reason or something, other than that, that

5

would support your position.

MR. ROSKE:

All of the cases that were cited in

Well, why don't we take the Ninth

This is the Chavez-Miranda --

MR. ROSKE:

14

QUESTION:

Right, Your Honor.
-- where the court said, Banks

15

appears to be a departure from our prior decisions.

16

noted by the trial court, we have found a 10- to 20-second

17

wait to be reasonable in similar circumstances.

18

MR. ROSKE:

As

I think that the court in Chavez-

19

Miranda focused on the fact there were numerous occupants

20

in the -- in the residence and that even if -- if one or

21

two were engaged in some kind of private activity, the

22

others would be able to respond quickly to the door.

MR. ROSKE:

Well, there are plenty of times that

about why he entered, he simply said that he thought that

MR. ROSKE:

this Court has a supervisory power and it has to not

I just simply point out that of

the two time frames that were cited below in the record,

believe, to know how much time elapsed since he was

conducting the entry.

upon hearing the door crash in, to -- to take any step in

MR. ROSKE:

Well, the inevitable discovery

that we're dealing with a dwelling and not an office, that

occur and routinely, and that in this case there was

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY

any additional reason or justification for acting wtih

4

I would say that the court -QUESTION:

What about the -- the drugs, the --

5

the fact that it was a drug charge and that drugs were

thought to be on the premises?

7

gives then officers at least a factor other than the

9

MR. ROSKE:

Do you not think that

Well, yes, I -- I would agree that,

10

you know, obviously if it were televisions or if it were

11

grand pianos, the idea that somebody is going to chop them

12

into splinters or into fragments and the -- thwart the

13

officer's whole purpose would entirely evaporate.

14

argued by the Solicitor General that in fact they thought

15

that maybe the place wasn't even occupied and therefore

16

they were doing an -- a senseless or a needless act by --

17

by delaying and knocking and announcing repetitively.

18

any event, I think that this case is -- is one where if

19

they truly believed it was unoccupied, that there would be

20

no harm and foul on the officer erring on the side of

Your opinions do matter

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID B. SALMONS

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SALMONS:

3

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

4

Unless the Court has any further questions, the Government

5

submits that the judgment below should be reversed.
QUESTION:

6

I have a question just with regard to

7

your opposing counsel's last assertion.

8

whether the rule you're arguing for would have been

9

applied in 1791?
MR. SALMONS:

10

Do -- do you know

Well, Your Honor, what I do know

11

is that as this Court indicated in its decision in Wilson

12

where it incorporated the common law tradition into the

13

Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness, that the

14

standard at common law was a flexible one.

15

require knock and announce in all cases, and it took into

16

account a variety of law enforcement concerns and, we

17

would submit, including the risk that there might be

18

dangers to the officer's safety or that evidence might be

19

disposed of.

20

consistent both with the common law tradition and with

21

this Court's decision in Wilson that incorporated it.

So we think that our rule is perfectly

QUESTION:

22

It didn't

But you don't disagree with the fact

23

that the -- or the -- the claim that the statute does

24

apply?

25

There was a duty to knock and announce.
MR. SALMONS:

That's correct, Your Honor.

We're
