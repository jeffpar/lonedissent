CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

5

Bucklew versus Precythe.

6

Mr. Hochman.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT HOCHMAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. HOCHMAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

Missouri intends to carry out

12

Mr. Bucklew's lethal injection execution

13

without informing medical members of the

14

execution team of the well-documented and

15

extremely uncommon medical condition that will

16

very likely cause his execution to involve

17

severe harm and suffering from the time they

18

begin to gain venous access all the way through

19

his eventual death.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Hochman, can

21

you tell me the current condition of your

22

client in light of Footnote 2 of your opening

23

brief?

24

does he still have a trach in his throat?

25

if he does, doesn't that moot out certain of

And in particular but not exclusively,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

your claims, particularly I thought much of the

2

prep work and dangers related to him choking on

3

his own blood.

4

now?

5

Doesn't the trach minimize that

MR. HOCHMAN:

Yes.

So, first, to

6

answer your question, as you know, we've -­

7

we've requested leave to lodge the medical

8

records from the summer.

9

It's obviously outside the record.

10

I'm happy to answer.
I just want

to make that clear.

11

Right now, as far as I know, he still

12

has a trach in.

13

how long he's going to continue to have the

14

trach.

15

that medical people determine it's appropriate

16

to do so.

17

There is no indication about

The trach could be removed at any time

I don't think it can moot out the case

18

because without -- if -- if the trach is

19

removed, all of the problems return.

20

what would happen if the trach wasn't removed,

21

I think there would still be complications that

22

would need to be investigated.

It's certainly true the core -­

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So we may be -- we

1

may be issuing a decision on -- an advisory

2

decision because, if the trach stays, it's a

3

totally different case than if it is removed.

4

MR. HOCHMAN:

I don't think it's an

5

advisory decision, Your Honor.

6

think the problem is you have a judgment right

7

now that says Missouri can go ahead and execute

8

Mr. Bucklew according to the protocol that they

9

have in place.

I think -- I

And we don't -- at this point,

10

we cannot say he certainly is in imminent

11

danger if that protocol is used at a -- yet

12

there is no pending execution date.

14

whether the bleeding problems complicate the

15

trach for him.

MR. HOCHMAN:

Well, it certainly can

The question is -- he -- he's got

discussed in the record.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. HOCHMAN:

And so -­
-- I'm a little

8

bit upset that you would come in and lodge

9

medical records without having secured the

10

information of whether he's physically capable

11

of having the trach removed or not.

12

MR. HOCHMAN:

So this is what we know

13

about why -- I don't know whether this is the

14

precise reason, but he is scheduled to have

15

dental surgery for a -- for a tooth issue that,

16

you know, because his mouth is so prone to

17

infections.

18

surgery.

19

So he's going to have dental

My suspicion is that they're leaving

20

the trach in for the surgery.

Assuming nothing, because I don't know what's

2

going to happen, it appears that your Dr. Zivot

3

was misreading the horse study, that his

4

four-minute estimate had to do with a different

5

study having to do with a dog and a different

6

agent, not the agent at issue here.

7

Given that without that study there's

8

no basis to believe that this -- that

9

pentobarbital would take four minutes to -- to

10

take effect, it would likely be -- I think it

11

was -- the figures were at maximum 52 and the

12

average is 20 to 30 seconds.

13

evidence in the record.

14
15

Is there anything left to your case
once that information is eliminated -­

MR. HOCHMAN:

-- that factual

misstatement?

19
20

That's the only

MR. HOCHMAN:
Honor.

Yes, there is, Your

Two things to say about that.
First, in fact, the maximum period of

22

time in that study, if you -- if you actually

23

time it from the beginning of the infusion all

24

the way through the -- the time that the EEG

25

reads zero, is 161 seconds, almost three

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

minutes.

2
3

It is true that he missed -- that he
misremembered the time.

That -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

MR. HOCHMAN:

6

you have to look at the study.

7

we looked at the study.

8

of infusion times in that study, 28 seconds to

9

115 seconds.

10

But the -­

What you have to do is
I went back and

There's a wide range

And that, just for reference, Your

11

Honor, the infusion times in the study referred

12

to are at, I think -- I think it's about -­

13

yeah, it's JA 265, appendix page 265.

14

talks about the -- the infusion rate.

15

And it

The other thing that study indicates,

16

which is also confirmed by Dr. Antognini's

17

testimony at page 316, is that the slower you

18

infuse, the longer it will take for the drug to

19

take effect.

20

Now here's what happened in the horse

21

study:

22

that -- the slowest infusion rate, 115 seconds,

23

that horse took the longest time, which is

24

exactly what you'd expect.

25

There was -- for the slowest horse,

Right?

That -- the horses were infused with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

four times, four times, the amount of

2

pentobarbital.

3

-- than human beings and so they -- they take

4

about four times.

5

They're much bigger than their

Dr. Antognini testified that he would

6

expect 100 seconds, just -- you know, about one

7

second per cc, so something a little bit more

8

than 100 seconds for Mr. -- for Mr. Bucklew's

9

infusion to take place.

10

So it's the same amount of infusion

11

time for the horse, except it's four times as

12

much.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's to -­

14

your termination point at that is when the EEG

15

is zero, right?

16
17

MR. HOCHMAN:

That's correct, on those

studies.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but,

19

for major surgery, they don't wait until the

20

EEG is zero.

21

like that?

22
23

It's, what, 40 or 50, something

MR. HOCHMAN:

that -- that reading, those -- those ranges are

somewhat disputed in the science, but,

we don't conduct experiments in this sort -- in

15

this sort of field.

16

the information as best we can.

17

We don't do -­

And so we're working with

And what I'm trying to emphasize here

18

is that the infusion rate for Mr. Bucklew,

19

especially compared to the horse study, is

20

substantially slower as a proportional matter.

21

And that's good reason to believe that

22

Dr. Zivot's fundamental estimate that there's

23

going to be a prolonged period of suffering, he

24

admittedly wasn't precise.

25

And -- and, Justice Sotomayor, you're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

absolutely right that I think he just crossed

2

up the numbers in his head from the study.

3

that doesn't change the fact that there's going

4

to be several minutes.

5

counting after they gain venous access.

6

But

And that's only

A large part of the claim here is

7

what's going to happen before they gain venous

8

access, and that's very, very important.

9

And note, Judge Colloton's dissent

10

specifically talked about the trial, the -- one

11

of the things he thought needed to be hashed

12

out at a trial is not only, you know, this

13

debate between Drs. Zivot and Antognini but

14

also whether he'll be required to lie flat,

15

which we've now learned new information about

16

since Judge Colloton wrote that opinion, and

17

whether his airway will -­

18
19
20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, what -­

what new facts?
MR. HOCHMAN:

Well, that's the -- the

21

-- at page 882 of the appendix, the statement

22

from Ms. Boyles that he will lie flat, he will

23

not lie fully supine at the time they

24

administer the lethal drug, which I take to be

25

strong evidence, actually.

They had time to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

think about this, they had time to make a

2

decision about what they wanted to represent,

3

and what they chose to say is we'll make sure

4

he's not lying flat at the time they begin the

5

infusion.

6

That's critical, because a large part

7

-- if we must prove, as -- as Judge Colloton

8

observed, if we must prove that the available

9

alternative method will substantially reduce

10

Mr. Bucklew's risk of suffering -- and, as you

11

know, we don't -- we don't think that's

12

necessary -- but if we must, we will explain

13

that the risk arises early in the execution

14

process and remains high throughout, through

15

the period that Dr. Zivot talked about.

16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is that

because of the injection difficulties?

18

MR. HOCHMAN:

Yes, right.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, does

20

that include the femoral injection option, or

21

are you only talking about the regular veins?

22

MR. HOCHMAN:

We're talking about the

23

femoral.

I -- I -- I think -- I think it's

24

more or less agreed that at this sum -­

25

remember, this is summary judgment -- so, at

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

this posture of the case, there's substantial

2

reason why a fact-finder would conclude that

3

the peripheral access is going to fail.

4

And as I read the Respondent's brief,

5

they make nods in -- in -- in the other

6

direction, but, essentially, they accept, the

7

district court accepted, the court of appeals

8

accepted that there's going to be -- they're

9

going to access the femoral vein.

We do not

10

deny -- we do not deny that they can access the

11

femoral vein.

12

That's going to happen.

We're not denying that.

The question

13

is how horrible is that going to be for him.

14

The last time they accessed the femoral vein of

15

an inmate because they had failed to gain

16

venous access -- and this is at page 611 and

17

612 of the appendix -- they did it through this

18

cut-down procedure.

19

And the cut-down procedure, they have

20

the kit in the room, that's page 615 to 616,

21

this is entirely within the contemplation, what

22

they expect to do.

23

They are dealing with inmates after

24

all.

Compromised veins is hardly an unusual

25

circumstance for them.

So -- so they're going

Heritage Reporting Corporation

to have to access the femoral vein, and the

2

cut-down procedure -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

4

-- do they have a certified anesthesiologist

5

available and did Dr. Antognini testify that

6

any board certified anesthesiologist would be

7

able -- in most instances, is able to access

8

the femoral vein without a cut-down procedure?

do Mr. Bucklew's execution.

Unless they've

So whatever, generally speaking, and

22

what Dr. Antognini said -- let's be absolutely

23

clear about this -- Dr. Antognini explained in

24

his -- in his deposition, he said everyone

25

who's board certified is trained to access the

But, when asked point blank does

everyone have experience doing it, he said no.

all and you could lose the ability to do it.

6

And now we have -- of course, we

7

haven't had discovery of M2 and M3, a separate

8

issue that I'll get to in a moment, but what we

know, given what we've had access to, is that

It does seem very

logical that the state would give an affidavit

Would you have a case left at that

2

pointed out, you know, adequate information is

3

critical here.

4

To be adequately informed, you

5

probably have to do imaging studies at some

reasonable time in advance of -- of the

8

I'd want to know -- I -- I -- I -- I'd

9

want to know what kind of experience they have,

10

not only with the cut-down, but, remember,

to just intubate on the fly someone in Mr.

15

Why?

Because that tumor

And if you've got a struggling, maybe

16

convulsing person even strapped down, and

17

you're trying to put a tube down his throat so

18

that he can breathe, the chances of a

19

catastrophic hemorrhage are very, very high.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. HOCHMAN:

Could I ask -­

So this has to be taken

22

care of, thought through in advance, I think

23

it's very complicated, and the judgment we have

24

right now just doesn't do it for us, and I

25

think you have to vacate and remand.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

What you are proposing, Justice

2

Sotomayor, is entirely sensible and could

3

happen on remand before the trial court, and

4

that's where it should happen, where it should

5

have happened before.

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Could I ask

7

you to address the reasonable alternative

8

question?

9

in your case, but assuming that it is, how can

I know you think it's not required

10

it be a reasonable alternative if it's never

11

been used before?

12

MR. HOCHMAN:

Yeah, Your Honor, I

13

think -- I think there are a couple reasons why

14

that's so.

15

First, I don't think that this Court

16

ever said in Baze that it has to have been used

17

before for it to be a reasonably available

18

alternative.

19

Baze to say is -- the key passage is at page 57

20

of the opinion -- no other state has adopted

21

the method that was being proposed in Baze.

22

What I understand the language of

And Petitioner's proffered no showing

23

that is an equally effective manner of imposing

24

a death sentence.

25

Oklahoma, Mississippi, Alabama, have adopted

Well, what do we have?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

lethal gas as -- as -- as methods of execution,

2

in addition now to Missouri, and it's not only

3

-- not only have we shown that it's an equally

4

effective manner of imposing a death sentence.

5

Dr. Antognini said so.

6

his opinion.

7

That's his -- that's

That's the evidence in the case.

There's the study from Oklahoma which

8

was done which went through the process that

9

would be involved in some -- in some detail,

10

talked about the right to die community's

11

favorable experiences with lethal gas.

12

Now it doesn't mean there's nothing to

13

be worked out.

14

be worked out.

Of course, there are details to

15

I don't -- I don't doubt that it would

16

have to be 100 percent pure nitrogen, because I

17

think it's actually potentially horrible if you

18

have either a leak in the -- in the -- in the

19

system or -­

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, one of

21

the things we see often in the Eighth Amendment

22

cases is the point or allegation that things

23

can go wrong regardless of the method of

24

execution.

25

And it seems to me that if you have a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

method that no state has ever used, that that

2

danger is magnified.

3
4
5

MR. HOCHMAN:

Possibly, Your Honor,

but -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And yet your

6

claim is that this is a better -- a better

7

alternative?

8
9

MR. HOCHMAN:
here's why:

Yeah, because here's -­

I mean, when you -- think about

10

what our claim is, this as-applied claim.

11

claim is that the officials in Missouri are

12

going to do everything that their protocol

13

directs them to do.

14

Our

I'm not assuming that there's going to

15

be a mishap.

16

going to go haywire.

17

going to go exactly the way they intend it and

18

that the process of things playing out exactly

19

that way is going to be severe suffering for

20

Mr. Bucklew.

21

I'm not assuming that something's
I'm assuming everything's

So now we move to a situation where a

22

method -- where I -- where I think it's made

23

substantially less, the risk is substantially

24

lower of that kind of severe suffering, and

25

this Court's cases have made clear that mishaps

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1
2

in protocol -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that

3

gets to the point -- I mean, you understand the

4

theory between Baze and Glossip, which is what

5

the Eighth Amendment prohibits is the

6

unnecessary infliction of pain.

7

-- death penalty is constitutional, as it now

8

is, there must be a way to administer it.

9

if you can show that there's another way that

If the death

10

is less painful, then the theory is, again,

11

that it's an Eighth Amendment claim because

12

it's unnecessary pain.

13

But,

But, again, it seems to me that you

14

can't make that showing with respect to

15

something that's never been -- never been used

16

by any other state.

17

MR. HOCHMAN:

I -- I don't think that

18

-- I don't think that's true, Your Honor.

19

think what happened in Baze was you had a

20

method that, assuming it went well -- that's

21

what the background, the basis was.

22

Remember, the -- the analysis was

23

comparative.

You start with the background

24

assumption in Baze that if everything goes

25

according to plan, there's -- there's not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1
2

constitutionally significant suffering.
Here, it's exactly the opposite.

If

3

everything goes according to plan, there is

4

constitutionally significant suffering.

5

-- the -- the relative risk of the just

6

unknown, you know, not quite sure because it's

7

never been played out before, which has no

8

purchase against the background in Baze, has

9

enormous purchase here.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

So the

It's -­
What do you do with

11

the -- do I understand where we are is that the

12

district court and the court of appeals assumed

13

that you had shown enough to deny summary

14

judgment to the state, you'd shown enough that

15

this method, because of his special condition

16

and the terrible tumors and so forth, could

17

cause serious suffering, and now they

18

overturned you on the second part and said:

19

But you haven't shown that that serious

20

suffering wouldn't occur anyway, even with your

21

new method.

22

All right?

That's where we are.

So, as of this moment, though, we've

23

been talking about the first part, and even you

24

say a lot of conditions have changed.

25

had changed.

And some

And some might have changed.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

we're missing a piece of evidence about an

2

affidavit that says, hey, the nurses and so

3

forth do what they're supposed to do.

4

Okay?

Now, as to the second part, which is

5

pretty hard to look at alone without the first

6

part, as to the second part, what in your

7

opinion should we do?

8

evidence in the record said, yeah, if we use

9

nitrogen, Doctor -- the doctor that you

Because the only -- the

10

mentioned said you use nitrogen 20 seconds, 30

11

seconds, he'll -- he'll be unconscious.

12

Okay.

The Chief Justice -- I mean,

13

that is a point; it's never been used before.

14

And even their doctors, they're listening and

15

-- or knows about all this and it all is on an

16

assumption that now seems not to be accurate in

17

your own view.

18

so -- so what in your opinion should the Court

19

do?

The horse study's misread.

20

MR. HOCHMAN:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

MR. HOCHMAN:

And

I have a proposal.
Yes.

Thank you, Justice

23

Breyer, because I have a proposal.

I think it

24

will address Justice Sotomayor's concern as

25

well.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

If you look at the appendix, the

2

fourth amended complaint, page 85 of the

3

appendix and page 90 of the appendix, among the

4

allegations in the complaint is not only do we

5

think lethal gas would be a viable alternative

6

method, but we also say, if after adequate

7

discovery it turns out it might be possible, we

8

just don't know, but it might be possible to

9

alter a lethal injection protocol in a way that

10
11

would satisfy constitutional standards.
So, if you vacate the judgment, if you

12

remand it to the district court, in part

13

because circumstances have changed, we don't

14

know whether the changed circumstances will

15

prevail at the time an execution is scheduled,

16

but in part because circumstances have changed,

17

if you vacate and remand, then we can go back,

18

we cannot only look into the question of what's

19

-- how the comparison in light of any new

20

circumstances would be to the lethal -- unknown

21

aspects of lethal gas, but we can also figure

22

out whether there are other ways to modify a

23

lethal injection protocol that alleviate this

24

grave concern.

JUSTICE ALITO:

You're not?

10

MR. HOCHMAN:

So -- so the way I

understand it is the issue is not that there

12

would be a shorter twilight period.

is, what's the degree of suffering that takes

14

place during the twilight period?

that lethal gas has is it's about twice as

and Dr. Antognini's testimony.

The Oklahoma information

JUSTICE ALITO:

11

didn't -- Dr. Antognini said that it would be

deny that he has this condition?

MR. SAUER:

You don't

Absolutely not.
You don't deny

8

that he has a small tumor but a tumor in his

throat?

MR. SAUER:

The evidence is it's quite

sizable, in fact.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Very

13

sizable.

14

It doesn't -- I don't believe, and I would hate

15

to think that a -- any state would intend to

16

gratuitously subject a prisoner to untoward

17

pain because they don't want to get a gurney

18

that moves the head up or that they don't want

19

to have personnel -- you require it in your own

regulations.

21

that you have to have someone -- I read them

earlier -- with the training, education, and

23

experience to do everything that's necessary to

24

reach the veins, et cetera.

those people and have them in place.

2

MR. SAUER:

Correct, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

5

steps necessary to avoid the horrific

circumstances that your adversary says can and

7

will happen?

horrific circumstances will arise, but I
believe we have made those representations.

We vigorously dispute that

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How do you -- why

do you dispute that?

13

MR. SAUER:

Because there's -- every

14

-- every stage -- every stage of the

15

predictions that are made by the Petitioner is

16

contradicted by evidence in the record.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. SAUER:

All right.

I -- I do want to address

19

the question about what representations we have

20

made.

director of Adult Institutions testified -­

22

this is in the record.

23

affidavit that we submitted in opposition to a

24

stay motion.

25

the gurney is adjustable and that the

At 531 of the Joint Appendix, the

It's not a supplemental

In the record is testimony that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

anesthesiologist has the discretion to adjust

2

the gurney to the position that would play -­

3

that would be in the inmate's most appropriate

4

medical interest.

5

And that is consistent with what the

6

execution protocol says, which is that the

7

anesthesiologist has the discretion, for

8

example, to locate the appropriate veins and so

9

forth.

10

I don't think there's any -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that -- I'm

11

hard pressed.

12

they get that one-page -- that one-page

13

discussion that only listed his condition.

14

anesthesiologist -- no representation has been

15

made that the anesthesiologist knows of his

16

history of breathing difficulty or anything

17

else.

18

As I understand the protocol,

MR. SAUER:

I disagree with that.

The

The

19

evidence in the record from the warden of the

20

institution is that I know he receives his

21

complete medical records, and I will supplement

22

that right now by representing to the Court

23

that the anesthesiologist has access to all the

24

medical records.

25

The one-page summary, the director of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

Adult Institutions -- it's at a higher level in

2

the Department of Corrections -- said that's

3

the only thing that I give them.

4

warden testified that he has -- he has access

5

to the entire medical records.

6

But the

And the one-page summary does say he

7

has cavernous hemangioma in the lower maxilla,

8

in the jaw, so it actually flags the issue, so

9

to speak, for the anesthesiologist.

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12

what do you recommend that we do?

13

difficulty with the discussion to me that

14

you're having right now is a legal difficulty,

15

that -- that you have the district judge and

16

the court of appeals both assuming he's made

17

his case on this point for summary judgment

18

purposes.

19

Do we know -­

That seems to be -­
I mean, the

And -- and you may be right, he

20

hasn't, but it's unusual for us to go into a

21

record like this, I think, and then reverse

22

both courts on that.

23

So then we're stuck with the other

24

part of it, which we don't know all that about

25

-- much about.

And the nitrogen, they have a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

good reason for thinking that the nitrogen

2

won't be painful, that it works in a different

3

way, and yet it isn't quite there in the record

4

and -- and -- and you can argue it and that's

5

why there was a dissent.

6

So what strikes me is at that part -­

7

at that point, you should go deal with this as

8

-- as -- as a person rather than a lawyer.

9

back and hold a full hearing on it.

Go

Go back

10

and find out if this man really is special, if

11

there really is a special problem, what we know

12

about the alternatives, all the questions that

13

you've pointed out and that they've pointed

14

out, which we don't have answers to.

15

Now I -- I -- why not?

16

MR. SAUER:

17

I would say two things in

response to that, Justice Breyer.

18

First, the State of Missouri has a

19

compelling interest in seeing this just and

20

lawful sentence is carried out as quickly as

21

possible.

22

which is the principal request of the

23

Petitioner here, would interject yet more delay

24

before the execution of a sentence that's been

25

in place for 22 years now.

A remand for further fact-finding,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38

Secondly, the evidence in the record

2

decisively -- decisively supports an affirmance

3

on either of the two alternative grounds,

4

either of the Glossip elements, and I'll -­

5

I'll -- I'll address, if I may, the one that

6

you raised, which is the second Glossip

7

element, about a feasible readily implemented

8

alternative solution.

9

Nitrogen hypoxia has never been tried

10

by any state.

11

for execution by nitrogen hypoxia.

12

has ever tried it.

13

in Baze, this Court said six times, including

14

twice in the opening three paragraphs of that

15

opinion, that an alternative method of

16

execution that is untried and untested, that no

17

state has ever used, that no study supports

18

showing its efficacy, is not an alternative

19

that's reasonable.

20

At this time, no protocol exists
No state

In the controlling opinion

JUSTICE BREYER:

It could.

I mean, my

21

reaction to that is a question mark.

22

that it hasn't been tried, it's certainly a

23

strike against it, but is it a fatal strike

24

against it?

25

I mean,

And the other thing that's going on in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

the back of my mind is -- is, of course, what

2

people do think very often is, look, once we

3

send it back on this, then they'll think of

4

something else.

5

endless delay because they think that the death

6

penalty is -- is not appropriate.

7

And really what's going on is

Okay?

So can that be guarded against here?

8

They -- they've sworn up and down, no, we're

9

not going to do that.

I mean, we're -- we're

10

-- this is really an unusual case.

11

know, you've read all that stuff.

12
13
14

And, you

So do you have anything you want to
say about that?
MR. SAUER:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

15

What I would say is that it is -- the holding

16

of Baze could not be clearer -- that if it's

17

completely untested and untried, it is not -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

I -- I

19

-- Baze had to do with a generalized attack to

20

a system of execution, and it basically said,

21

if you don't like this system, you've got to

22

get another because -- you have to propose

23

another because, otherwise, what you're trying

24

to do is to abolish the death penalty.

25

intent is to do away with the death penalty,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Your

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1
2

and we're not going to let you do that.
I don't actually know where in the

3

Eighth Amendment and its history the Court made

4

up this alternative remedy idea because the

5

Constitution certainly doesn't prohibit cruel

6

and unusual punishment, unless we can -- unless

7

we can't kill you at all.

8

But putting it aside, this is -- an

9

as-applied challenge is not going to abolish

10

the death penalty with respect to everybody.

11

It's going to tell the state:

12

individual with a unique circumstance in which

13

a method of execution is going to cause that

14

person excruciating pain, cruel and unusual

15

pain, you better find a different way.

16
17
18

If you have an

I don't understand why we would extend
Baze to an as-applied challenge to start with.
Number two, if a statute, your

19

statute, the Court hasn't made it up, lists

20

available alternatives, it's your job to find

21

them and your job to put them into place.

22

not the inmate's job to do that, putting aside

23

that he neither has the resources to do it or

24

the expertise to do it.

25

It's

But I'm wondering why we're assuming

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

that Baze should be extended to an as-applied

2

challenge at all.

3

MR. SAUER:

I don't -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Secondly, address

5

the question of why feasibility -- there are

6

some courts who have now held the only feasible

7

alternative is an alternative mentioned in a

8

state statute, so now we're in a Hobbesian

9

circle.

The state gives us an option.

10

point to it.

11

option.

12

I can't

The state doesn't give me an

Now there's no alternative.
We're really in a circle that you

13

can't get out of.

14

say, once the first prong is met, and the

15

courts below didn't -- they assumed it, they

16

said there were material issues of fact, you

17

should have gone on trial for that, I don't

18

think the trial would have taken very long, and

19

once that happened, you figure out how to kill

20

him.

21

MR. SAUER:

Why don't we just simply

There was a lot there.

22

I'd like to address first, if I may, the

23

question of whether -- why the second element

24

in Baze should apply in an as-applied

25

challenge, and I'd offer four reasons for the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1
2

Court's consideration.
The first reason is that it is

3

dictated by the holding and the reasoning of

4

the Baze case.

5

decided two years after Hill against McDonough.

6

And in Hill against McDonough, the argument was

7

a challenge to a method of execution is really

8

a challenge -- it's an attempt to seek a de

9

facto exemption from the death penalty and,

Keep in mind that Baze was

10

therefore, it ought to be treated as a second

11

or successive habeas petition.

12

And this Court in Hill said no, no,

13

no, this petitioner is actually leaving open

14

the option that he could be executed by a

15

different method; therefore, it's not a de

16

facto attack on the validity of the sentence.

17

But then, when Baze came around two

18

years later, this Court held that we're

19

adopting a second element in part because we do

20

not want petitioners to be able to seek a de

21

facto exemption from the death penalty or

22

engage in -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We exempt certain

24

people from the death penalty:

the mentally

25

ill, the incompetent, people who are young.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

haven't seen that as abolishing the death

2

penalty.

3

exemption to a particular person or individual

4

for whom this method is cruel and unusual.

5

We see it as -- as an as-applied

MR. SAUER:

In all or virtually all of

6

those contexts, the person who is exempted from

7

the death penalty possesses a characteristic

8

that undermines the penological objectives of

9

the death penalty.

That is the holding of

10

Roper and Atkins, Ford against Wainwright, and

11

every one of those cases.

12
13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about the

constitutional -­

14

MR. SAUER:

This Court held that there

15

would be no deterrence or retributive purpose

16

to that.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about the

18

constitutional principle against unusual -­

19

cruel and unusual punishment?

20

every individual has that Eighth Amendment

21

right.

22

MR. SAUER:

I -- I think

That is correct.

And the

23

scope of that Eighth Amendment right is what is

24

set forth in Baze and in Glossip.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Are you saying,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

even if the method creates gruesome and brutal

2

pain, you can still do it because there's no

3

alternative?

4

MR. SAUER:

I believe that any

5

petitioner who is claiming that it would create

6

gruesome and brutal pain must, under Baze and

7

Glossip, offer an alternative method that

8

significantly reduces the pain.

9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So you're saying

10

that even if the method imposes gruesome,

11

brutal pain -­

12

MR. SAUER:

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

14
15
16

That is -­
-- you can still

go forward?
MR. SAUER:

Well, I would say again

that that petitioner has to if they want to -­

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

18

MR. SAUER:

Is that a yes?

Yes, it is, Your Honor.

19

And that is the holding of Glossip.

The

20

holding of Glossip was -- I mean, these kinds

21

of predictions were made in Glossip.

22

closest facts of the case -- the closest facts

23

to that hypothetical were the facts of Glossip.

24

In Glossip, the argument was that everyone who

25

was subjected -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

2

on that?

3

--

Is there any limit

Is there any limit to the degree of

4

MR. SAUER:

There is a limit, Your

5

Honor.

I think there -- the limit would occur

6

if the method of execution were viewed as

7

superadding terror, pain, or disgrace within

8

the meaning of the Court's earlier method of

9

execution cases.

10

So if the method of execution was so

11

gruesome and brutal or -- or -- or was even

12

relevantly similar to the historical gruesome

13

methods of execution that are categorically

14

prohibited by the Eighth Amendment, there would

15

certainly be a claim in that context where -­

16

or, in the words of Baze and Glossip, there is

17

an attempt to deliberately inflict pain for the

18

sake of pain, that would be categorically

19

exempted.

20

method is not required.

21

In that context, the alternative

But if a petitioner claims that, well,

22

I'm predicting that I will suffer under these

23

circumstances, that petitioner must, under the

24

logic of Baze and Glossip, plead and prove an

25

alternative method.

And one of the compelling

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

reasons that this Court offered for that was

2

that this Court recognized that it is -- to

3

eliminate the risk of pain completely is

4

impossible.

5

Glossip context is very different than this

6

context.

And that's why the Baze and

7

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But doesn't the

8

first prong deal with that?

9

have to have a substantial showing of severe

Namely, that you

10

pain?

11

identified, which is there's always going to be

12

some degree, but it has to be a substantial

13

risk of severe pain?

14

Doesn't that get at the concern you just

MR. SAUER:

I don't think it gets all

15

the way to it.

16

and Glossip adopted this as, in the words of

17

Baze, a -- or in the words of Glossip, a

18

substantive element of this particular claim.

19

So -­

20

And I believe that is why Baze

JUSTICE BREYER:

I thought -- I'm

21

trying to get back to my question, which is

22

asking you as a prosecutor, but, look, I guess

23

you would agree that some -- X has a rare

24

medical condition that makes the method of

25

execution to him feel exactly like being burned

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

at the stake.

2
3

Okay?

Would -- the Constitution would rule
that out, wouldn't it?

4

MR. SAUER:

The Constitution would

5

rule out burning at the stake, absolutely, Your

6

Honor.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- but, yeah, he

8

doesn't -- he has a mental condition of some

9

kind.

It makes it exactly the same.

10

MR. SAUER:

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

12
13
14
15
16

That is -­
It feels exactly the

same.
MR. SAUER:

I would have to know more

about the hypothetical.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that's it.

I'm

making it up as I go along.

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay?

But what I

19

want is -- it's exactly the same to him as if

20

you burned him at the stake.

21

you're going to rule out the one, you'd rule

22

out the other.

23

going to say next he, this particular

24

individual, will, because of his rare medical

25

condition, feel exactly the same as if he'd

And I guess if

That's my thought, because I'm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

been drowned to death over -- slowly over a

2

period of time.

3

Okay?

So that's why I think Justice

4

Kavanaugh brought that up.

5

-- my -- and I -- and that seems to me to be

6

the factual issue that's underlying your first

7

point.

8
9

But my -- my -- my

But now we're back in the weeds with
this individual.

So I'm interested in your

10

experience and as far as you read about it and

11

know about it, what do we do about, in your

12

opinion, 42 years in prison, 20 years in

13

prison, 30 years in prison, and people

14

thinking:

15

that don't like the death penalty and,

16

therefore, there's one thing after another and

17

it goes on and on and on, and when we send it

18

back here, we'll see that they'll think of a

19

new one after this one and -- and so forth.

20

Well, the reason is it's the courts

So I -- I -- I think it's a serious

21

question.

22

you think.

23

And -- and I would like to know what

MR. SAUER:

If I may, Your Honor, I

24

understand the question to be if -- if there is

25

an exceptional delay before the implementation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

of the death penalty, does that raise a

2

question as to whether or not the passage of -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I'm not doing it

4

that technically.

I'm -- I'm doing it because

5

this case really exhibits, as I said -- it's -­

6

as a special case, and I think of the burning

7

at the stake example.

8

people think that's just something they're

going to bring up and lose or win and then they

go on to the next one after that and the next

this because you want to give them basic

14

fairness.

15

the stake.

And I've -- I've written and

Well, it's because it's very hard to do

You don't want to burn someone at
And that takes time.

16

MR. SAUER:

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

It -­
So -- so what is your

take on that?

19

MR. SAUER:

If this -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. SAUER:

My general argument.

If this Petitioner were to

22

predict that he would experience a sensation

23

like burning at the stake, he would be the

24

third petitioner or the third set of

25

petitioners in the last 10 years to make that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

prediction.

2

that was made in Baze and Glossip.

3

petitioners predicted that midazolam, for

4

example, in Glossip would not suppress the

5

feeling that would be akin to being burned at

6

the stake.

7

That was the precise prediction
Those

And this Court held twice that these

8

people must show that this is sure, very likely

9

to happen, and they must show that there's an

10

alternative method of execution that is readily

11

feasible.

12

And, of course, these hypotheticals

13

about being burned at the stake aren't really

14

implemented in the real world.

15

implemented in the real world is a situation

16

where capital petitioners have every incentive

17

to engage in interminable litigation,

18

interminable litigation, multiple challenges.

19

What's

So, absent that second element, absent

20

that second Baze element, what would almost

21

certainly happen in every case is, once the

22

petitioner had made a threshold showing on the

23

first element and the state came up with an

24

alternative, there would be a subsequent

25

lawsuit or an amendment of the petition,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

resulting in a second attack.

2

exactly what we have here.

And that's

3

We have a petitioner -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That may well be,

5

but the reality is that there are alternatives.

6

Many of them have not been implemented because

7

people want -- don't want to see them:

8

firing squad, electrocution.

9

lot of things that people don't want to accept

10
11

the

There's a whole

the reality of, but they're there.
And if you're going to make the person

12

find a choice of how to kill himself, I simply

13

haven't answered -- my question is, if the

14

statute permits it, why shouldn't they be able

15

to choose it, if they have proven -- and I

16

understand that's a big debate here -- if they

17

have proven that the method you've initially

18

chosen will create cruel and unusual pain?

19

MR. SAUER:

I believe statutory

20

authorization alone is insufficient to

21

demonstrate that something is readily

22

implemented or known and available within the

23

meaning of Baze.

24
25

Now, if there were a petitioner -­
some capital petitioners, for example, in Ohio

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

have been pleading things like firing squad and

2

hanging as alternative methods of execution.

3

Where there is historical pedigree to it, this

4

Court has previously affirmed that that is a

5

viable method of execution that is

6

constitutional.

7

There is a dispute in the courts of

8

appeals about whether or not statutory

9

authorization is a necessary condition to show

10

that things are readily available, but right

11

now, in the Eighth Circuit, statutory

12

authorization is not required.

13

case last year, the -- the Eighth Circuit said

14

we do not say that statutory authorization is

15

required.

16

In the McGehee

So there are options available.

If

17

someone really thought that I will suffer,

18

experience like burning at the stake,

19

presumably that person would plead, you know,

20

lethal gas, would plead -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So are you saying,

22

Mr. Sauer, that we would be in a different

23

situation in this case right now if the

24

Petitioner had instead requested an

25

electrocution or a firing squad?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

MR. SAUER:

It would certainly have

2

been a stronger case.

Now what actually

3

happened was, in the second page of his

4

complaint, he dropped a footnote saying, I'm

5

not asking for firing squad.

6

firing squad, but he did not ask for it saying

7

that because it is not statutorily authorized.

8

So he, for strategic or inadvertent reasons,

9

has never presented the issue in this case, and

He mentioned

10

Missouri's never taken a position on it, as to

11

whether or not statutory authorization is a

12

alternative -- is required.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

14

MR. SAUER:

15
16

General -­

And Missouri takes no

position on that now.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I ask a -- a

17

different question?

You know, one of the

18

things that strike me -- strikes me, when I

19

went back and -- and looked at Baze, there's a

20

lot about kind of deference to a state

21

legislature and state officials about

22

determining the appropriate method of

23

execution, about giving a kind of considered

24

judgment to the sort of pain that would be

25

expected from an execution, as well as their

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

interests in carrying out legitimate sentences

2

and making decisions on that basis.

3

But what strikes me is that when we

4

think about that, those officials really are

5

thinking in gross, if you know what I mean.

6

They're thinking about a method of execution as

7

applied to the general class of people and

8

deciding that it's appropriate.

9

And what, of course, makes this case

10

very different is that it's not in gross.

11

a particular person that says I have a highly

12

unusual condition that will make the execution

13

highly unusual, that will have me suffer highly

14

unusual pain.

15

It's

And in that context, I think all of

16

that stuff that we talked about in Baze about

17

why we should refer to state-considered

18

judgments really falls away because there's

19

been no considered judgment, surely by the

20

legislature and, in general, by officials,

21

about -- about one particular person.

22

And it strikes me that because that's

23

true, the way we look at a case like this has

24

to change.

25

what your response to that is.

So I'm -- I'm wondering, you know,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

MR. SAUER:

I think what I would say

2

to that is the deference that Baze and Glossip,

3

as you described, gave to sort of the

4

legislature, you know, as to the generalized

5

method of execution, it would be appropriate.

6

It would be deeply consistent with this Court's

7

precedents to give that same kind of deference

8

to the state officials who are implementing the

9

-- the execution in the concrete, in this

10
11

individual case.
Missouri has a board-certified

12

anesthesiologist who will be in charge of

13

putting IVs into this particular person.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

See, I'm not sure that

15

that's true, because those officials are

16

working within a system.

17

within a set of legislative rules that have

18

been made in this sort of general sense.

19

for them to go outside that system would be -­

20

you know, and say it's not appropriate for this

21

particular person would be an extraordinary

22

person for -- an extraordinary thing for an

23

individual person to do.

24
25

They're working

And

So I don't think we could
realistically give the same kind of deference

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

to that sort of decision.

2

MR. SAUER:

I think the deference that

3

I had in mind is deference to the

4

determinations that are made on the site as the

5

execution is going forward, where there's

6

uncontradicted evidence in the record in this

7

case that the -- the medical team is making all

8

the medically relevant judgments.

9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

On -- on -- on

10

that point, do we know that he will not be

11

lying flat, or are you saying that doesn't

12

matter?

13

MR. SAUER:

Both of those.

We know

14

that, first of all, it was established by the

15

pleadings, as the majority held in the Eighth

16

Circuit, that he pled that the state has

17

offered to adjust the gurney to the most

18

appropriate position, and we admitted that in

19

our answer.

20

In addition to that, uncontradicted

21

testimony at page 531 of the Joint Appendix

22

says the gurney is adjustable and it can be

23

adjusted to the position that the

24

anesthesiologist deems the most appropriate.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And related to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

that, the -- your opposing counsel said, even

2

if everything goes according to plan, there

3

will still be significant suffering.

4

Can you respond to that?

5

MR. SAUER:

6

disagree with that.

7

of Dr. Antognini, is that the only suffering

8

that would occur in this execution that could

9

be medically predicted was the suffering

I absolutely, absolutely
The testimony about this,

10

associated with the actual entry of the IV, in

11

other words, the pinpricks or the cut-down

13

Now I say cut-down procedure, and

14

truth in fact, the record decisively shows that

15

a cut-down procedure is not done in the femoral

16

vein.

17

testimony of Dr. Antognini, who says a cut-down

18

is done on the saphenous, which is much lower

19

down in the leg, in the angle.

20

The only evidence of this is the

A cut-down is not done on a femoral

21

fact, Dr. Antognini said there is no need to do

a cut-down on the femoral because it is "easily

accessed."

care to use an ultrasound in accessing the

5

femoral.

6

And, in fact, it is not standard of

So -- and the holding of the district

7

court on this very point was that, not only has

8

he put in no evidence that there will be any

9

difficulty at all accessing the femoral, but in

10

addition to that, that he had presented no

11

argument in opposing summary judgment about any

12

difficulty that would happen on any vein other

13

than the peripheral veins in his arms.

14

So there's really nothing in the

15

summary judgment record that supports the

16

predictions that are being made on -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, there

18

was a prior execution where a cut-down was done

19

by, he says, the same person who's going to do

20

this one, and there was problems then.

21

Why isn't it a predictive -- a

22

reliable predictive tool to show that the same

23

person who's going to do it now botched it

24

earlier?

25

MR. SAUER:

There is no evidence of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

problems.

And the only testimony in the record

2

is from the warden, who is not a medical

3

person, who said that a local anesthetic was

4

given and a cut-down was done in the leg.

5

The testimony of the doctor is that a

6

cut-down is typically not done in the femoral,

7

which is high in the leg, but is typically done

8

in the saphenous, which is low in the leg.

9

So there's no evidence in the record

10

that any cut-down has ever been done on the

11

femoral.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Sauer, I believe

13

some time ago you said there were four reasons

14

why you thought at step 2 a defendant should be

15

required to show an alternative.

16

not sure we got past the first of those four.

17

I'm not even sure we got the first one out

18

there, actually.

19

-- what all four are.

20

I'm -- I'm

And I'm curious what -- what

MR. SAUER:

The first reason is that

21

the logic and the holding of Baze and Glossip

22

requires -- it holds that this is a substantive

23

element of any method of execution challenge.

24
25

The second one is that, as Baze and
Glossip both said, the death penalty is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

constitutional and there must be a means of

2

carrying it out.

3

just as much in the microcosm as to the

4

individual petitioner who's seeking a de facto

5

exemption from the death penalty as it does in

6

the macro -- macrocosm.

7

And that reasoning applies

In fact, the concerns of undue

8

suffering that were presented in Baze and

9

Glossip were much greater and much more

10

sweeping than had been presented in this case

11

because they would have applied to every single

12

petitioner who is subjected to the two, three

13

drug protocols that were disputed in that case.

14

Here, we're talking about the

15

suffering of a single petitioner.

16

same balance that the Court struck by adopting

17

the second element applies in this particular

18

case.

19

Exactly the

In addition to that, both Baze and

20

Glossip relied on Farmer and Wilson, going back

21

to Estelle, which itself relied on Weisweber,

22

for the proposition that there must be a

23

showing of subjective blameworthiness in this

24

context for there to be an Eighth Amendment

25

violation.

And Wilson said that one critical

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

factor in whether or not there is subjective

2

blameworthiness is a constraint facing the

3

official.

4

If there is no alternative method of

5

execution available, and the official is under

6

a directive from a jury verdict that there is a

7

just and lawful sentence that must be carried

8

out, then the -- it's very difficult, if not

9

impossible, to draw the inference that there is

10

subjective blameworthiness in that particular

11

case.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Wouldn't the first

10

prong of Baze deal with your second, third, and

11

fourth arguments that you just listed?

12

MR. SAUER:

I don't think it deals

13

with them very effectively.

severe harm.

17

MR. SAUER:

I don't think it does so

18

effectively.

19

this Court in Baze and Glossip was keenly aware

20

of this fourth concern, which is the concern of

21

adopting a rule that would leave open the

22

possibility of challenge after challenge after

23

challenge.

24
25

And one of the reasons is that

JUSTICE BREYER:

challenge, that's -- I see that.

But here is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

person who has some evidence anyway that, when

2

you execute him, it's going to be like slowly

3

drowning him to death and there's a good chance

4

of that.

5

So, in your opinion, should the

6

person, given the Eighth Amendment, not even

7

have the right to make that argument?

8

MR. SAUER:

This Court -­

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if he has the

10

right to make that argument, then how do we

11

avoid the situation that we're in of having to

12

decide it?

13

argument, that I want this alternative, how do

14

we avoid the situation of 15 years of testing

15

every possible method of execution?

16

And if he has the right to make the

MR. SAUER:

I would say two things in

response to that.

the suggestion that he's presented any

19

competent evidence that he actually will

experience something like a prolonged drowning.

there is no evidence, competent evidence, that

supports that.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT HOCHMAN

23

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

24
25

MR. HOCHMAN:
Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

I'd like to make two points, first

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

about the alternative method requirement, and

2

second about the disposition in this case.

3

Starting with the alternative method

4

requirement, Justice Kagan, I think you have it

5

exactly right, that if you imagine that the

6

State of Missouri thought about how to build a

7

method of execution that was going to create

8

the subjective experience that the record

9

indicates here for everyone, that the record

10

indicates here Mr. Bucklew would experience,

11

nobody would do it.

12

They wouldn't do that.

I -- I don't

13

think so ill of Missouri or -- or -- or counsel

14

on the other side to imagine they would do

15

that.

16

as it plays out imagines that because they were

17

thinking about something else, and because

18

there's a way to carry out executions for lots

19

of people, which this case doesn't call into

20

question at all, that you can nonetheless do it

21

in that way to this person, unless this person

22

is able to come up with what they consider to

23

be a specifically highly detailed way to manage

24

their own and -- and -- and propose their own

25

execution.

Yet, the alternative method requirement

any sense.

Their view of the alternative method

15

requirement is, as soon as he walks into the

3

There has to be a substantial risk,
And -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Doesn't the -- isn't

4

the role of the second prong at least in part,

5

and maybe in full, what has been called by the

6

lower courts as the second prong, something

7

that informs the first prong?

8
9

So you determine whether something is
severe and substantial in relation to other

10

known methods of execution on the assumption

11

that any execution can cause pain.

12

Certainly, it's going to cause a lot

13

of emotional pain that's probably going to

14

exceed the physical pain.

15

MR. HOCHMAN:

I think that's true when

16

you're talking about a facial challenge

17

because, remember, in a facial challenge,

18

you're trying to figure out, as this Court

19

said, all methods of execution involve some

20

degree of pain and suffering.

21

Right?

So you need something to compare it

22

to.

Was this too much?

Well, compare it to -­

Mr. Bucklew's experience is going to
be nothing at all like that, and miserably so.

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But why -- why -­

5

why wouldn't we want to do the comparison, if

6

we're going to do it in gross on a facial

7

challenge, why wouldn't we do the comparison,

8

if you concede it's valid there, why wouldn't

9

we want to do the same comparison specifically

10

when it comes to your client?

11

to look outside what Missouri has authorized,

12

but -- a firing squad or whatever, but why

13

wouldn't we do that exact same analysis in

specific?
