CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

Republic of Sudan versus Harrison.

Mr. Curran.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHRISTOPHER M. CURRAN

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. CURRAN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

When we're talking about a mailing and

12

a requirement that the mailing be addressed and

13

dispatched to a specified person, we naturally

14

understand that to require that the mailing

15

bear the address of the person and be sent to

16

that address.

17

That plain meaning of 1608(a)(3) is

18

reinforced by other features of the FSIA's

19

service provisions.

20

Congress intended there to be an intermediary

21

between the sender and the ultimate recipient,

22

it said so.

23

addressed service through the U.S. Secretary of

24

State.

25

authorized the service through an agent in the

Specifically, when

It said that in (a)(4), where it

It said that in (b)(2), where it

United States.

2

No counterpart in (a)(3).

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I have to say,

3

if -- my first instinct if I wanted to mail

4

something to the head or cabinet member in a

5

foreign country, I would -- that would be my

6

first thought:

7

embassy.

8
9

Why don't I deliver it to the

I mean, the idea of mailing it to the
foreign minister in some country and assuming

10

it's going to get there in any reasonable time,

11

I think you're much more -- much more likely to

12

reach them through the embassy.

13

MR. CURRAN:

Yeah.

Well, I -- I don't

14

think that can be squared with the plain

15

language of 1608(a)(3) or, again, the

16

surrounding provisions of the FSIA's service

17

provisions.

18

of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, does not

19

have an office in -- in the diplomatic

20

missions.

21

complying with the statutory language to send

22

the mailing to that diplomatic mission.

23

--

24
25

A -- a foreign minister, the head

So it literally would not be

JUSTICE ALITO:

Some

Suppose somebody -­

suppose somebody sent you a letter addressed to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

the White & Case office in New York City.

2

bet that would get to you, wouldn't it?

3
4

MR. CURRAN:

I

It might get to me.

Yeah, it -- it should.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would that not be

6

addressed -- would that not be addressed to

7

you?

8
9

MR. CURRAN:

I -- I don't think it

would be addressed and dispatched to me, no.

10

My address is always held out as 701 13th

11

Street, Washington, D.C.

12

-- it might get to me, but it wouldn't be

13

compliant with language -- with the statutory

14

requirement like we see in (a)(3).

15

So that might -- that

And -- and -- and, Justice Alito,

16

furthermore, 1608(c), with the return receipt

17

requirement, how would that square if a package

18

was sent to me in New York City?

19

recipient up there in the mailroom sign the

20

return receipt?

21

hardly proof of, delivery to the ultimate

22

recipient when it's going through an

23

intermediary in that manner.

24
25

Would the

That hardly guarantees, that's

JUSTICE ALITO:

But it just -- I'm not

so sure that the "addressed and dispatched"

language do the trick for you.

2

went to any U.S. embassy around the world, I

3

think you would see posted -- you would see

4

mounted on the wall a picture of the Secretary

5

of State, which signifies in a sense that the

6

Secretary -- this is under the jurisdiction of

7

the Department of State.

8
9

MR. CURRAN:

I mean, if you

Under the jurisdiction.

Well, Justice Alito, I guess I would draw an

10

analogy.

11

were the circuit justice for, probably the

12

Third Circuit perhaps.

13

package sent to a federal district court in New

14

Jersey be addressed and dispatched to Your

15

Honor?

16

it's accompanied by a requirement that it be a

17

return receipt that will be evidence of, proof

18

of, delivery.

19

I -- I don't know what circuits you

Would -- would a

I think not, particularly if it -- if

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, it might -- it

20

might not be.

But when -- when I was on the

21

Third Circuit, my office was in Newark, but the

22

headquarters of the court was in Philadelphia.

23

And I used to get mail that was addressed to

24

me, U.S. Court of Appeals, Market Street,

25

Philadelphia.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

MR. CURRAN:

Yeah.

We're -- we're

2

talking about a statutory provision that has to

3

be applied literally and strictly.

4

strictly because the provision, 1608(a), unlike

5

(b), particularly (b)(3), doesn't say actual

6

notice, does it, or anything like that?

7

the -- the circuit courts have concluded almost

8

uniformly that 1608(a) requires strict

9

compliance.

10

I say

And

It's certainly not strict compliance

11

to address a package to Newark for a Third

12

Circuit judge.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, Mr. Curran, I

14

guess I'm wondering, the -- the statutory

15

language does not say "at his own office."

16

-- and in the absence of that kind of language,

17

I suppose this is maybe what the Chief Justice

18

was -- was gesturing towards too, that there

19

seems something special about the embassy

20

situation that's not like one of these Third

21

Circuit situations, that's just everybody

22

understands that embassies are supposed to be

23

the point of contact if you want to do anything

24

with respect to a foreign government.

25

MR. CURRAN:

And

Yeah, I -- I -- I don't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

agree with that.

2

informed or looks into it would conclude that

3

the embassies are there to serve as diplomatic

4

functions, not to be a catch-all recipient for

5

service of process or other things being sent

6

to the foreign state.

7

I -- I think anyone who's

The -- and -- and we'll get into the

8

Vienna Convention in a bit, but the diplomatic

9

missions have a very specified and limited

10

role.

And it's -- and there's no suggestion in

11

law or the -- the -- the U.N. conventions or

12

otherwise that it's there to -- for the

13

convenience of plaintiffs.

Massachusetts Avenue.

receive this notice?

2

MR. CURRAN:

3

There's nothing in the

record that tells us that he did.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You say this

5

was not -- the embassies are not there for the

6

convenience of -- of people wanting to sue or

7

plaintiffs, but they're there for the

8

convenience of the host -- or the country,

9

Sudan in this case, right?

10
11

MR. CURRAN:

And to facilitate

diplomatic communications -­

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

MR. CURRAN:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I -­

-- between the countries.
-- I would

15

have thought it would be much more -- I mean,

16

they tell us not -- I would have thought it

17

would be much more convenient for them to get

18

notice that they're going to be sued in the

19

United States at the United States embassy.

20

mean, I would have thought, otherwise, it's -­

21

you know, who knows, it's going to get lost

22

or -­

23

MR. CURRAN:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Yeah.

I

-- much more

likely for them to hear about it if you give it

to the embassy here.

2

MR. CURRAN:

Yeah, I think that the -­

3

the amicus briefs that Your Honor has received,

4

that this Court has received, from foreign

5

states suggest otherwise.

6

reality is a foreign ambassador located in

7

Washington, D.C., gets flummoxed at the

prospect of receiving service of process.

These -- many of these diplomatic

and -- and a staff generally of -- of people of

nationalities different from the sending

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

May I ask you the

6

"address and dispatch" concept, much of the

7

brief was centered around that being where the

8

minister sits in the capital of the foreign

9

state.

But there are many countries where the

10

minister -- the foreign minister doesn't

11

necessarily sit in the capital.

12

assume an emergency, something's happened at

13

that minister's seat and he's now sitting -­

14

MR. CURRAN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Or let's

Okay.
-- in a nearby

building -­

17

MR. CURRAN:

Yeah.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- or in another

19

city within the state.

Or even he's decided

20

he's going to come and spend three months in

21

the United States.

22

who thinks he should visit all foreign

23

countries -­

It's one of these ministers

24

MR. CURRAN:

Yeah.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- for an extended

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12

period.

2

MR. CURRAN:

Well, I -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is "address and

4

dispatch" to his home in the foreign state, to

5

his normal place of business?

6

what's -- how do we define it?

7

MR. CURRAN:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Yeah.

What -- what -­

Well -­
If I'm writing

this opinion -­

10

MR. CURRAN:

Yeah.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- because I don't

12

actually think you mean to -- to say -- to add

13

a phrase -­

14
15
16

MR. CURRAN:

I don't mean to add a

phrase.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- at the foreign

17

state's ministry or something.

18

MR. CURRAN:

It's -- it's where -­

19

where -- where the foreign minister has an

20

address, it's got to be sent.

21

think the fair reading when it says head of the

22

foreign -- of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

23

that's implying the -- an official address and

24

not a home address.

25

the way, based on my research, there aren't

Now I think -- I

But if it -- there -- by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

many countries that have a minister of foreign

2

affairs not in the state capital.

3

there are about three.

4

I think

But let -- let's -- let's use an

5

example.

Let's take South Africa, where the

6

minister of foreign affairs has offices in both

7

Pretoria and Capetown, but -- but,

8

coincidentally, they -- there's also a single

9

mailing address, but -- but in that situation,

10

I think it would be perfectly acceptable for

11

the package to be sent to any one of those

12

addresses because they are all addresses of the

13

-- of the head of the foreign ministry.

14

It's -- it's strictly a factual

15

question, where is the address of the foreign

16

minister?

And in -- in -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

or her official address, is that it?

19

MR. CURRAN:

What's his -- his

I think it should be the

20

official address, but -- but, again, here, it

21

wasn't sent to any address of the foreign

22

minister.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

When this statute was

24

enacted, do you think Congress thought that

25

sending something Return Receipt Requested to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

Khartoum, for example, was -- was a simple

2

thing?

3

Return Receipt Requested to, I don't know

4

where, someplace in the United States?

5

It would be like sending something

MR. CURRAN:

Yeah.

Well, we have -­

6

we have a rich record of the legislative

7

history here, so we know a lot about what

8

Congress, or -- or maybe more accurately, the

9

State Department and the Department of Justice

10

thought when they were drafting this statute in

11

the mid-'70s.

12

On -- on that point, Congress

13

recognized that in many situations that return

14

receipt might not be coming back, either due -­

15

due to problems with the mail system, or a -- a

16

declination of signing it in the foreign

17

country.

18

But Congress was -- was strategic, and

19

this hierarchy they set up in 1608(a) has got

20

number 4, which is a fail-safe option that is

21

always available, can never be rejected.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I'm just asking

23

about the practicalities of this.

24

it would be this is before the era of FedEx and

25

-- and all that, so did -- was there a simple

So I assume

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

way to do this with the U.S. Postal Service?

2

And you -­

3

MR. CURRAN:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes.

-- you send a Return

5

Receipt Requested and -- and it comes back from

6

the far reaches of the world?

7

MR. CURRAN:

Yes, but it did require

8

the cooperation of the mail service in the

9

foreign country.

And the reliability of that

10

wasn't always assured for sure, because there

11

are over 100 foreign countries that this thing

12

could be mailed to, but, again, there is -­

13

there is the catch-all.

14

And -- and -- and -- and speaking of

15

the legislative history, here, it powerfully

16

confirms what I propose is the natural reading

17

of 1608(a)(3), because Congress in the initial

18

draft that, again, was sponsored by the

19

Department of State contemplated delivery of

20

the service package to the embassy in

21

Washington, addressed to the ambassador or

22

other head of the mission.

23

And that led to a -- an immediate

24

concern that it was transgressing the Vienna

25

Convention and the inviolability of diplomatic

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

missions.

2

Department of State, therefore, changed the

3

statute to avoid any connection with the local

4

embassy to service of process.

5

And -- and Congress and the

And this is all spelled out.

They

6

issued a circular to every diplomatic mission

7

in Washington in 1974 saying:

8

this draft bill, it talks about delivery to the

9

ambassador.

Hey, we've got

We're going to change that because

10

we are aware of the concerns about the Vienna

11

Convention.

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And yet, when the

13

question came up to a sister nation, the U.K.,

14

they said the Vienna Convention doesn't

15

prohibit -­

16
17

MR. CURRAN:

Yeah, Your Honor's

probably referring to the Reyes case.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

MR. CURRAN:

Yes.

Yeah.

That case is -- is

20

quite different.

That case did not involve

21

service on a foreign mission.

22

service on the residency of a diplomatic agent

23

who was then no longer in service and who did

24

not enjoy immunity and there was no other way

25

to serve that former diplomatic agent.

It involved

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

And in the U.K. Supreme Court

2

decision, the court expressly distinguished the

3

situation with a service on a foreign state or

4

the mission of a foreign state, saying that

5

that was precluded by Section 12 of the U.K.'s

6

1978 immunity statute.

7

So I don't think the Reyes case is -­

8

is persuasive on -- on -- on the question we're

9

addressing.

But -- but Congress purposefully

10

changed the -- the bill that became the FSIA to

11

avoid any transgression of the inviolability of

12

the diplomatic mission.

13

And the reports, the parallel reports,

14

the House report and the Senate report, are

15

both very express in saying we're changing the

16

statute to avoid the Vienna Convention problem

17

and that's why there's no delivery.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, on that, the

19

-- the U.K. decision did -- did speak to the

20

inviolability.

21

send -- doesn't mean sending mail.

22

intruding into the premises, let's say, having

23

a police officer with an arrest warrant or a

24

search warrant, that's what the inviolability

25

of the mission -­

They said inviolability doesn't
It means

MR. CURRAN:

I -- I agree.

I agree

2

that the logic of the U.K. Supreme Court's

3

decision is problematic with respect to the

4

Vienna Convention.

5

But I think the -- the U.K. court felt

6

that it was boxed in with some bad facts and

7

that it had to provide a way to have service of

8

process against that former diplomatic agent.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If I could take you

10

back, Mr. Curran, to the text of the statute.

11

I mean, one of the notable things about

12

1608(a)(4) which is not replicated in

13

1608(a)(3) is that 1608(a)(4) does specify an

14

address.

15

dispatched by the Clerk of the Court to the

16

Secretary of State in Washington, D.C.

You know, it says addressed and

17

MR. CURRAN:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

Yeah.

So what -­

And -- and 1608(a)(3)

does not say at his office in the Sudan.

20

MR. CURRAN:

Correct.

So the question

21

is, what inference do we draw from that

22

contrast?

23

inference to draw is it confirms that

24

everybody's thinking that the foreign minister

25

gets served, whether it's the U.S. Secretary of

And I submit that the -- the proper

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

State or the foreign, foreign minister, they're

2

all getting served in their official offices in

3

their home capital.

4
5

I think it confirms that.

Also -- and this -- this might sound a
little strange, but -­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess I don't really

7

quite understand that, because, here, they

8

clearly thought that they had to specify when

9

they wanted to specify, you know, at his office

10

on -- on -- in -- in Washington, D.C.

11
12

MR. CURRAN:

didn't say C Street in Foggy Bottom, right?

13
14
15

Yeah, but they -- they

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, you know, close

enough.
MR. CURRAN:

So under the plaintiff's

16

-- yeah, but under the plaintiff's theory, oh,

17

if it's not precluded, then any other indirect

18

method of service is okay too.

19

can send it to the White House knowing that

20

Secretary Pompeo visits there occasionally.

21

-- I don't think -- I don't think that -­

22

inviolability also addresses any effort to

assert jurisdiction at a diplomatic mission.

We -- we think that's pretty

established.

5

perhaps were -- and maybe the SG's office as

6

well -- were trying to obscure the 1958

7

commentary, which suggested that service could

8

be done by mail, compliant with the Vienna

Convention.

10

Now our friends suggest that we

were obscuring anything.

12

addresses in great depth the Japanese proposal

voiced by Mr. Takahashi that was proposing that

15

Article 22, be changed to allow service by

mail.

That proposal was roundly rejected.

18

It was withdrawn and never adopted.

So the

19

language of Article 22 as adopted by -- at the

Vienna Convention, by the committee of the

whole, indicates that the attendees at the

22

convention recognized that service by mail

would be a transgression of a foreign

minister's inviolability, the foreign mission's

25

inviolability.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERICA ROSS FOR THE

UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

9

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

10
11

MS. ROSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

12

I'd like to start off where Mr. Curran

13

left off, which is how other states understood

14

the Vienna Convention when it was actually

15

enacted.

16

he also mentioned, the legislative history and

17

really the drafting history of the FSIA itself

18

because, when Congress considered this issue,

19

this very issue, it initially had service by

20

mail to an ambassador, which everyone

21

understood to be service by mail to the

22

embassy, in the first draft of the FSIA.

23

that was, in fact, rejected, as Mr. Curran

24

noted, precisely because of this concern of

25

inconsistency with the Vienna Convention.

I think we -- we see this through, as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
23

And the way that Congress knew that

2

there was this concern was that other states,

3

in fact, came to the State Department and said

4

that this was a problem.

5

get the 1974 statement to the missions at

6

Washington, D.C., that Mr. Curran also referred

7

to.

And that's where you

8

Now I think there is -­

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

If the -- if the Court

10

were to rule against you on this, how would the

11

interests of the United States be harmed?

12

MS. ROSS:

Your Honor, Justice Alito,

13

I'm glad you asked that question.

That's

14

exactly where I was going to go next, which is

15

that the United States does not accept service

16

by mail on one of its embassies abroad, and

17

that is true even if a mailroom employee signs

18

for the package.

19

United States sends back a diplomatic note, it

20

informs the sender that we do not consider that

21

to be proper service under international law,

22

we will not be appearing in court, and we will

23

not be honoring a default judgment.

So, in that instance, the

24

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Why doesn't it?

Why doesn't the United States accept it?

4

MS. ROSS:

The United -­

5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

6

MS. ROSS:

What's the harm?

So the United States

7

doesn't accept it, Your Honor, because it's not

8

consistent with the Vienna Convention and with

9

international law more generally.

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But is there a

11

more particular harm that comes from accepting

12

it at an embassy?

13

MS. ROSS:

14

is an administrability harm.

15

think the violation of international law is

16

itself sufficient.

17
18
19

Your Honor, I think there

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Now, of course, I

I understand that,

but I'm more -­
MS. ROSS:

But even moving on from

20

that, I think that the harm is that the United

21

States has embassies all over the world,

22

obviously, and sort of deputizing each of those

23

to accept service on behalf of the United

24

States is quite problematic.

25

It's even more problematic if you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

accept a standard like the one that my friend

2

suggests at page 34 of their brief, which is

3

that service would be permissible at any place

4

likely to have a direct connection to the

5

foreign ministry.

6

consulates, for example.

7

that have 40 consulates in the United States.

8
9

That would open up
There are countries

And so, if similar treatment were
extended to the United States abroad, you could

10

see that there would be a variety of places

11

where service would be made.

12

obviously, from an administrability standpoint

13

is quite problematic.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

And that,

I still don't -- I

15

don't quite understand it in practical terms,

16

although I see your point about the consulates,

17

but say that the United States is sued in -- in

18

Germany, and if process is served on the

19

embassy in Germany, I assume that the embassy

20

there would promptly send it to the State

21

Department in Washington.

22

But I also suspect that the State

23

Department in Washington would send it back to

24

the embassy in Germany to -- because if -- if

25

it was necessary to go into a German court,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26

somebody would have to find attorneys to go

2

into the court to represent the United States

3

in the foreign country.

9

MS. ROSS:

Justice Alito, I'm not sure

that's actually how it would work in practice.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, okay.

Yeah, how

would it work?
MS. ROSS:

So my understanding, Your

Honor, is that the Office of Foreign Litigation

10

actually in Washington, D.C., oversees all of

11

that foreign litigation, and so it makes

12

perfect sense in our system that we would want

13

that to be coming to the Secretary of State in

14

Washington, D.C., if at all, and in that case,

15

under diplomatic note rather than through

16

direct mail service.

17

But I think it's important to note

18

that all of these questions sort of get to this

19

idea that, well, it might make sense for

20

service on an embassy, maybe that will, in

21

fact, reach the foreign minister.

22

in addition to the textual point that

23

Mr. Curran made, which is, in subsection (b)(2)

24

of the statute, when Congress expected an agent

25

to accept service in the United States, that

But I think,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

was actually spelled out in the statute.

2

It's also true that in subsection

3

(b)(3), again, another provision governing

4

foreign agencies and instrumentalities but not

5

governing foreign states, there is a provision

6

for methods of service that are reasonably

7

calculated to provide actual notice.

8

think, when Congress wanted a looser, sort of

9

whatever will actually get it back to the

And so I

10

intended recipient standard, it actually said

11

so.

12

(b)(3).

And we see that, again, in subsection

13

I would also point out that there was

14

some discussion about subsection (a)(4) of the

15

statute.

16

about the -- the many reasons why Congress

17

might have included Washington, D.C., in (a)(4)

18

without the -- the similar statement or express

19

statement in (a)(3).

20

Now I -- I think Mr. Curran spoke

I would also just note that in the

21

prior draft of the legislation that we've been

22

discussing this morning, the -- service was to

23

be made on an ambassador rather than -- or did

24

not expressly say on the embassy, but everyone

25

understood that to be where it would be.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

that's, in fact, why other nations raised

2

objections to the United States, and why the

3

United States asked -- or -- or why the State

4

Department suggested a change to the statute.

5

And so I think, similarly, it sort of

6

makes sense in the evolution of the statute to

7

understand that when Congress moved service

8

from the ambassador, which was understood to be

9

at the embassy, quite literally across oceans

10

to the foreign minister, it was similarly

11

understood to be at the foreign ministry rather

12

than at the -- the embassy in the United

13

States, again, because that's something that

14

was specifically rejected.

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

it, 1608 is already a lower bar than what the

20

United States itself asks for when it is sued

21

or what other nations ask for when they're

22

sued.

23

-- a lower process than what's normally

24

acceptable.

25

that it's different than what you do now?

So it's already different process than

So what difference does it make

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

MS. ROSS:

So, Your Honor, two

2

responses to that, one practical, one legal.

3

My practical understanding is that attempted

4

service by mail to the embassies -- to United

5

States embassies abroad happens nearly every

6

day, and so that is actually a very large

7

concern for us as a practical matter, whereas

8

attempted service by mail to the State

9

Department is actually much less frequent, just

10
11

on the practicalities.
As a legal matter, obviously, we think

12

that the United States has a reciprocity

13

interest in having foreign litigants or foreign

14

sovereigns brought into our courts only under

15

the same circumstances that we ask abroad.

16

I don't think that there's a way to -­

17

to read (b)(3) that doesn't permit service by

18

mail to the foreign state, but -- to the

19

foreign ministry in the foreign state, and so I

20

think our reciprocity interests really come in

21

where we think the text is clear under (a)(3)

22

that you can't serve on an embassy, but -- but

23

if, you know, there's any ambiguity there,

24

that's where we think our reciprocity interests

25

should be brought to bear.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

I would note more generally I think

2

the United States' interests here are not only

3

in reciprocity; they're also in consistency and

4

predictability, which is something that this

5

Court noted in Helmerich is especially

6

important in the context of foreign sovereign

7

immunity because we are bringing foreign

8

sovereigns into our courts.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But if I could

10

ask you to pause just for a moment.

11

-- you say in your brief on the -- the Vienna

12

Convention that foreign nations would be

13

affronted by sending a letter -- someone

14

sending a letter to their embassy.

15

You -- you

I -- I -- I just don't understand.

I

16

understand the idea that they don't want police

17

officers coming and knocking on the door and

18

saying I've got a search warrant or -- or

19

whatever.

20

reaction to getting a letter in the mail to be

21

that they're affronted by it.

22

But it's hard to imagine someone's

MS. ROSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, I don't

23

think this is an ordinary letter.

This is a

24

jurisdiction-asserting summons.

25

literally the sovereign of the United States

It's quite

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

sort of exerting its hand into the embassy and

2

saying you better show up in court or we're

3

going to enter a default judgment against you.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's not

5

literally them inserting their hand.

6

putting the letter in the mailbox -- mail,

7

right?

8
9

MS. ROSS:

It's

Your -- Your Honor, again,

I think it's not just a regular letter.

It is

10

a letter that has -- or a summons that has very

11

serious judicial consequences.

12

it is not just your regular dropoff of mail.

13

But I think that we -­

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so I think

But why -- why is it

15

any more of an affront if you send it to one

16

place than if you send it to the other?

17

MS. ROSS:

Well, Justice Kagan, the

18

foreign minister -- or the foreign ministry

19

abroad is not protected by the Vienna

20

Convention, and so there isn't this idea that

21

you have inviolability of those premises.

22

that is the way that -- that states are more

23

likely to expect to get the service,

24

particularly -- and (a)(4) was discussed

25

earlier -- if it comes through diplomatic

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1
2

channels under (a)(4).
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is there a regulation

3

that suggests that the State Department under

4

(a)(4) can -- can serve to the embassy if the

5

foreign state otherwise -- if the foreign state

6

so requests or if otherwise appropriate?

7

that also a violation of the Vienna Convention?

8
9

MS. ROSS:
points on that.

So is

It's not, Your Honor.

Two

The first is that under -­

10

again, as a practical matter, that happens

11

quite infrequently.

12

circumstances where we either don't have an

13

embassy abroad and don't have a protecting

14

power that can deliver the summons.

15

That is really in extreme

But, on the -- the legal matter, under

16

Vienna Convention Article 41, Section 2,

17

diplomatic channels, which are a

18

well-established way of states communicating

19

with each other, never violate mission

20

inviolability, so that simply isn't a concern.

21

And I think this is an important

22

point, that (a)(4) is both always available and

23

never a violation of diplomatic immunity.

24

it is not as though Respondents will not be

25

able to ultimately complete service in this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

Official - Subject to Final Review

case or in any case.

It is simply a question

2

of how that service is, in fact, delivered.

3

And, again, we think on -­

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how does -- how

5

does that work, mechanically, the (a)(4)?

6

there's a quest -- request for the Secretary to

7

send what used to be called a letter rogatory;

8

is that what it is?

9

MS. ROSS:

So

Well, so -- so what would

10

happen in practice, Justice Ginsburg, is that

11

the litigant would ask the State Department to

12

serve abroad.

13

had not -- that (a)(1) and (a)(2) were not

14

available and that service under (a)(3) was not

15

successful, meaning that the return receipt did

16

not come back.

17

It would have to show that it

And then the State Department, in the

18

usual case, will send the materials after

19

ensuring that they're correct or -- you know,

20

satisfy all the statutory requirements, will

21

send those materials to the United States

22

embassy abroad, which will in turn transmit it

to the foreign ministry in the foreign state.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Sudan seeks to reverse a $300 million

on an unstated procedural requirement.

Sudan argues that the Cole victims

improperly served their complaint by sending it

accepted.

interpretation is not necessary to comply with

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

business in the embassy.

physically there except for an occasional

most due process concerns that you serve the

person where you're likely to find them.

-JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

sure that you can avoid reading "addressed and

24

place where this person is regularly to be

25

found, not merely where his entity has -- does

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36

some transactional business occasionally.

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Sotomayor, I

3

take your point about state service rules, but

4

I think that that cuts in our favor and not

5

against us.

6

In our brief at page 23, we cite a

7

number of federal provisions that are to the

8

same effect, that in a wide range of contexts,

9

ranging from FDA notices to the Longshoreman's

10

Act, various federal statutes and rules specify

11

places where documents should be served.

12

They specify residences or businesses

13

or last known addresses.

14

Rule 4(i)(1)(b) specifies that service of

15

documents on the United States should go to the

16

Attorney General of the United States at

17

Washington, D.C.

18

And, in fact, Federal

And so it certainly is true that,

19

ordinarily, one would serve documents at, you

20

know, a home or an official address, but,

21

ordinarily, that address is specified.

22

where it is not specified, our submission here

23

is a quite modest, straightforward, textual

24

one.

25

And

It is that the embassy is an official

component, an extension, of the foreign

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And that concept, I think, is the

But I don't think that

16

you can get that out of the phrase "addressed

17

18

of due process -­

19

I think that the outer bounds

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, "addressed

20

and dispatched" has a very sense of urgency.

21

You're going to send it to the person and not

22

to some far distant place from where that

23

person may be on occasion.

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But, Justice

Sotomayor, as you are well aware, the outer

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

bound of due process, the familiar Mullane

2

standard, is the notion that it must be

3

reasonably calculated to give notice.

4

And our standard gives effect to that

5

because, as you will be aware from our brief,

6

we think that the phrase "addressed and

7

dispatched" requires the service pack to be

8

sent in an expeditious manner.

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now we think -­

Isn't it -- isn't

10

it strange to think that we have the Vienna

11

Convention that protects the embassy from a

12

service processor knocking on the door and

13

hand-delivering something, but you can go in by

14

mail and place a burden on the embassy by

15

requiring either that it put it in its

16

diplomatic pouch or hand-deliver it or do

17

something else, do the mailing for you, to the

18

foreign minister?

19
20
21

Isn't that the exact kind of burden
that the convention was intended to avoid?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

I do not think that

22

there is anything strange about the distinction

23

between a process server on the one hand and

24

service by mail on the other.

25

If you take a look at the critical

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

piece of drafting history, the 1958 revised

2

commentary, which really is the definitive

3

commentary of the International Law Committee

4

on the Vienna Convention, in the paragraph on

5

which we rely, the very paragraph, they draw

6

precisely this distinction.

7

And the reason I would submit that

8

they draw this distinction -- and this is also

9

captured in Lord Sumption's opinion for the

10

U.K. Supreme Court in Reyes -- is that there is

11

something relating to dignitary interests about

12

personal service, the notion that some person

13

is going to turn up at the embassy or skulk

14

around at the embassy and wait for someone to

15

arrive so that they can hand them a document.

16
17
18

That interferes with the functions of
the embassy in a way that a mailing does not.
JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

But I -­

19

I have a question.

20

judge, and so I read that and paid attention to

21

that, but I agree with you, it's textual.

22

And Sumption's a good

That's your argument.

And I find it

23

ambiguous, so we'll assume it's ambiguous.

24

look to purpose, Justice Sotomayor did, and I

25

-- I cut that a little against you because you

had mentioned -- left one word out of your

2

beginning.

3

judgment.

4

You said you want a $300 million
You left out the word default.

It was a default judgment.

And, of

5

course, that's the concern, that's the purpose

6

concern, that they have one ambassador, an

7

assistant, and four people working in the mail

And they don't know

16

because that's not my question.

17

And you only have 60 days to

go look up what other countries do, and this is

22

what I found.

23

Not sure about

What about history and

And there I asked my law clerk to

I found -- of course, we have five

24

here, Austria, Libya, Saudi Arabia, the UAR,

25

and the Sudan, and they all say we do it the

2

Belgium, the same.

3

signed a -- a -- a -- a convention which says,

4

in the absence of an existing agreement,

5

service on a foreign country must be to the

6

Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

7

so we got 22 more.

8
9

Then Canada, the same.

Twenty-two countries have

Okay?

That's -­

And then I tried to find one the other
way.

Couldn't find one.

Well, Sumption.

And

10

what Sumption was about is what he said.

11

was about a former ambassador of service in his

12

residence.

And they say foreign states are

13

different.

And then there's some language that

14

helps you.

15

It

And then I looked to what we did here,

16

and what we did here is the Congress wanted to

17

do it your way, and State wrote them a letter,

18

and nobody says that that Vienna Convention on

19

inviolability is clearly yours or clearly

20

theirs.

21

about it.

22

What they say is there's an issue

And because -- and there is an issue.

23

And because there is an issue, they said to

24

Congress, the state, don't do it, this isn't

25

the way we do it.

And after the state wrote

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

them that letter, they changed the law.

2

dropped the language that said you can serve an

3

embassy.

4

They

Okay?
So, so far, I have U.S. history.

I

5

have at least 22 to 27 countries.

6

nothing the other way, except arguable dictum

7

in a case that involves something else.

8
9

I could find

Now I put that long question to you
because I want to give you a chance to say no,

10

I'm wrong, there are 32 countries who do it

11

differently, or whatever you want to say.

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I'm not going to

13

say you're wrong, Justice Breyer, but I will

14

address what I think were really the three

15

parts of your question:

16

policy; and, third, the practice of other

17

countries.

18

first, text; second,

So, with regard to the text, as you

19

know, our submission is quite simple.

It's not

20

that this is an ambiguous provision.

21

it's a broad provision.

22

of that is that in the very next paragraph,

23

(a)(4), a location is specified and all of the

24

statutes and rules that we cite in our brief, a

25

location is specified.

It's that

And the best evidence

Official - Subject to Final Review

And so, if there is not a location,

2

that does not connote ambiguity.

breadth.

Justice Kagan, something special.

5

extension of the foreign ministry in the United

6

States.

7

say that that is an address at which service of

8

process to the foreign minister is proper.

9

It connotes

And the embassy is, in the words of
It is the

And so it is quite a modest step to

Now, on the issue of policy, I think

10

that the best response to your concern about

11

policy -- and I acknowledge that there was a

12

default judgment in this case, though no one

13

can dispute that Sudan had actual notice of

14

this case and, of course, more than actual

15

notice of the ongoing Cole litigation, which

16

had been going on for many years, but even if

17

you put that aside, the simple response to all

18

of the policy considerations offered by my

19

colleagues on the other side is that, under

20

(a)(3), it is completely within the control of

21

the foreign state whether to accept (a)(3)

22

service not only at its embassies but more

23

generally.

24

And I would urge this Court to take a

25

look at the policy of the United States, which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

we cite in our brief and we provide a correct

2

website in our supplemental letter, it's a very

3

brief document, which makes clear that not only

4

does the United States not accept service at

5

its embassies; it would not accept mail service

6

even at the State Department.

7

The sole ways in which the United

8

States accepts service, if you look at page 2

9

of the current version of the policy, is either

10

through diplomatic channels or through the

11

Hague service convention, which is what (a)(2)

12

refers to.

13

All we are saying is that if this

14

Court gives full effect to the language of

15

subsection (a)(3), a country can adopt such a

16

policy and implement such a policy.

17

for instance, some letter or package got

18

inadvertently signed for, the country could

19

send it back immediately.

20

And if,

That is, of course, not what took

21

place here.

In all three of the lawsuits,

22

Sudan signed the receipt.

23

at the Joint Appendix at page, I believe, 74,

24

and see the return receipt for yourself.

25

so a country can avoid (a)(3) service, if it so

You can take a look

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

chooses, either altogether or at the embassies.

2

Now, with regard to the practice of

3

other countries, I would certainly acknowledge

4

that (a)(3) is an unusual provision under any

5

of our interpretations.

6

mail is not provided under the laws of many

7

other countries.

8
9

Service of process by

It is true that a number of countries
do provide for service of process by mail on

10

diplomatic personnel where it's a complaint

11

against diplomatic personnel, and that is, of

12

course, the upshot of the law in the U.K., as

13

Lord Sumption discusses in paragraph 15 of his

14

opinion.

15

But I think that that illustrates why

16

the government's interest in this case is

17

unfounded.

18

since the FSIA was enacted in 1976.

19

has permitted service of process by mail where

20

many other countries do not.

21

no evidence of some form of retaliation against

22

the United States, and I think it is highly

23

unlikely, with all due respect -­

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

U.S. law has been non-reciprocal
U.S. law

And yet there is

Well, I didn't talk

about retaliation, you see?

So now where I am

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

is -- because I -- you'll see what I'm going to

2

say in a second, but -- but I -- I think that

3

-- that, yeah, maybe my purposing was -- I'm

4

not sure how overstated, because I do worry

5

about these small embassies, but text, you

6

can't get me too far.

7

it is ambiguous.

8
9

You -- I mean, it's -­

But I still have the simple fact that
every other country in the world has a

10

different policy and we did too.

11

point out correctly that there are other ways

12

that they could get to this same policy

13

elsewhere in the statute if they want to.

14

And now you

And the problem is -- and I -- maybe I

15

-- I mean this seriously, and I don't mean it

16

to be facetious -- Botswana perhaps does not

17

have a lawyer like you.

18

these countries, often very small, often

19

without adequate legal advice, something that

20

departs from a simple legal rule that every one

21

of them has followed in one form or another in

22

the past is something that makes me nervous.

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

24

offer a fourth answer -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

And to turn over to

Well, let me then

Yeah.

All right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- which is that you

2

ought not to be nervous about that because

3

there are things that countries can do in your

4

Botswana hypothetical.

5

is, if the package gets transmitted to the

6

foreign ministry and someone sees it and says

7

we should not have accepted service, it could

8

be returned immediately.

9

principles of rescission, we're aware of at

One thing they can do

And applying ordinary

10

least one district court decision in which a

11

court has said:

12

away, and so we're going to treat this as if

13

service was not effective.

Well, you returned it right

14

But I think more importantly -- and,

15

again, there is evidence of this in the lower

16

court case law -- if a country after the fact

17

does not, in fact, transmit the service packet

18

appropriately, the country can come in and

19

object to any default or to a subsequent

20

default judgment in the country -­

to them, they send it back, it's now going to

take whatever amount of time to come back, and

7

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

And I worked with her

24

for quite a while.

But the point is I'm just

25

taking that as a -- it could be a totally wrong

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

example, and what that is, is that there are

2

many countries that don't have the resources to

3

figure out what a default judgment means, to

4

figure out where they're going to go and they

5

-- and to know who to transmit things to, and

6

the chances are just much greater that the

7

right authorities will get the piece of paper

8

if you send it to the ministry, which is likely

9

to be better staffed in their own country.

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I mean, perhaps.

So I

11

think you could still have the risk of the same

12

problem under Petitioner's and the United

13

States' interpretation because, after all, the

14

practical reality is that it's not the foreign

minister himself or herself who's going to be

10

Would it apply to the Number 2

They all have a direct line of

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I -- I think that the

11

-- the better view is that if it is an official

12

address of the foreign ministry that is likely

13

to have a direct line of communication -- and I

14

think Mr. Curran agrees that it has to be an

15

official address, so a home address or other

16

address would not qualify -- I think that that

17

would satisfy our standard.

18

But I think that if this Court were

19

concerned about that breadth -- and I'll

20

explain in a minute why the Court shouldn't be

21

-- it could draw a line around embassies

22

because embassies certainly perform the full

23

panoply of functions of the foreign ministry.

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but, counsel,

if we're concerned about the text -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shanmugam, can

we back up?

talking about a question of personal

6

And this is -- are we -- we

What is the basis of subject

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So the basis for

cause of action uniquely for victims of terror

And, in fact, there is a federal

attacks against state sponsors of terrorism

11

under Section 1605(a).

12

It is true that this issue of service

13

goes to personal jurisdiction under -- I

14

believe it's Section 1330(b).

15

personal jurisdiction issue.

16

And so this is a

I do want to say one last thing in

17

response to Justice Alito before I forget, and

18

that is that, you know, if the Court is

19

concerned about consulates and U.N. missions,

20

again, the Court could distinguish embassies on

21

the ground that embassies perform a unique

22

function.

23

adopt a policy of not accepting service at its

24

consulates or at the U.N. mission.

25

And, of course, a country could

As a practical matter, I don't think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

it's going to matter very much, and we did look

2

at the case law, and I think we found around

3

three cases where parties have attempted

4

service at consulates or U.N. missions.

5

think the reason it wouldn't matter is that if

6

there is an available address in the United

7

States, i.e., the embassy, there's not going to

8

be any need to attempt service on the consulate

9

or on the U.N. mission in New York rather than

10

And I

in Washington, D.C.

11

And I do think that one factual point

12

here bears emphasizing.

13

was first attempted by my co-counsel, Mr. Hall,

14

in the Rux case in 2004.

15

attempted service at the embassy was for the

16

simple reason that, in 2004, Sudan was at the

17

tail end of its Civil War and it was very hard

18

even to find someone who would deliver a

19

package to Khartoum with the requisite return

20

receipt.

21

This method of service

The reason that we

And so this case really illustrates

22

why this policy makes sense.

It makes sense

23

because the embassy is, indeed, the extension

24

of the foreign ministry in the United States,

25

and it can choose how it wants to process or

Official - Subject to Final Review

There's no requirement that it use a diplomatic

And in 2018, there are faster ways of

Justice Sotomayor -­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are you asking us

7

to -- are you suggesting that the U.N. embassy

8

would be a place to effect service under this

9

provision?

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think it would

11

satisfy our statutory text -- our statutory

12

text argument.

13

turning to that.

14

And I heard Justice Gorsuch
Let me address that directly.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, yes.

I would

15

think textually, you'd have a very difficult

16

time drawing a line around embassies.

I mean,

17

you -- you suggest we might do that.

I suppose

18

we can do just about anything.

19

I don't see how you make that argument.

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, textually,

Well -­
I would think

22

consulates, trade offices, tourism offices that

23

are part of the ministry would all be included,

24

I would think, under your interpretation.

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

textual argument is that at least the verb

2

"dispatched" connotes some notion of

3

expeditiousness and promptness, and we're all

4

in agreement about the relevant dictionary

5

definitions.

6

And I think with an embassy, ex-ante,

7

I think it is reasonable to think that it's

8

going to get to the foreign minister because of

9

the direct line of communication and because

10

embassies are directly in communication with

11

foreign ministries all the time.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

just that it is less likely to arrive in an

expeditious manner if you send it to a tourist

25

we're in agreement, again, that it has to be an

4

I do want to say -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

A second question if

I might.

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Sure.
What do we do about

7

the fourth subsection, which does specify

8

diplomatic means, addressed to the Secretary of

9

State, if you -- if you failed under 3, you go

10

to 4, and 4 says then you send it to the

11

secretary of state here in Washington, the

12

United States Secretary of State, and -- and

13

the Secretary will then use diplomatic means to

14

get it to the appropriate folks.

15

And when Congress speaks so clearly

16

about the question of diplomatic means in one

17

place, we tend to usually think it's excluded

18

elsewhere.

19

What do we do about that?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I don't think

20

that that hurts us, and, in fact, I think that

21

(a)(4) helps us in numerous respects.

22

first is, of course, the plain text argument

23

that, there, Congress specified a location for

24

the initial delivery to the -­

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The

I understand that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56

argument.

2

That's not my question.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

And I -- I think

3

to be sure, (a)(4) is, you know, the fallback.

4

It is potentially available.

5

where the Fourth Circuit rejected our

6

interpretation, we're in the process of

7

attempting service right now under (a)(4) and

8

working with the State Department to do that.

9

In the Kumar case

And the way that (a)(4) service

10

operates is that you deliver the service packet

11

first to the Secretary of State.

12

Interestingly, and somewhat responsive to Mr.

13

Curran's point, you know, the Secretary of

14

State has a lot of buildings even in

Now let's -- let's get to the question,

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yeah.

Well, I'm -­

I'm -- I'm -- I'm not meaning to filibuster.

22

-- I just -- I want to make sure that the Court

23

understands how this actually operates.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

We understand that

I

the State Department is large.

My question is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

just, it speaks there that the Secretary will

then use diplomatic means to get the service

effected.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So what's the -­

what's the answer to it?
MR. SHANMUGAM:

That's a somewhat

17

different argument, I think, from the arguments

18

that Sudan and the United States have made, and

19

so let me address it directly.

20
21
22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Let's -- let's say I

disagree with that.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

So I -- I don't

23

think that the reference to diplomatic channels

24

in any way excludes service at diplomatic

So you are using

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, we are -- I -- I

13

-- I would hesitate to say that we're using

14

diplomatic means other than in the very generic

15

sense, Justice Gorsuch, which is to say that in

16

any form of (a)(3) service, you know, you are

17

going through the foreign ministry.

18

question is, how are you going through the

19

foreign ministry?

20

The

21

the briefs.

25

It's 22 CFR 93.1.

It's cited in

And it -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You're counting on

(a)(3) that -- that the embassy's going to send

2

it through a diplomatic pouch or otherwise to

3

the foreign ministry, right?

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Or some other means.

5

But, again, diplomatic channels, it's a defined

6

term and it refers to communication from one

7

sovereign to the other.

8
9

You know, that is what diplomatic
channels means.

And so, if you look at the

10

relevant regulation, it sets out the various

11

ways in which that occurs.

12

true, as Ms. Ross said, that the -- that the -­

13

probably the most common way this occurs is

14

that the State Department sends a service

15

packet to the United States Embassy in

16

Khartoum, and it attempts to deliver the

17

service packet.

18

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And it is certainly

As a practical

19

matter, as a practical matter, is that hard to

20

accomplish?

21

forward, if we were to say you can't do it at

22

embassies, is there a problem going under that

23

mechanism?

24
25

In other words, the system going

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, you know, the

problem is that I don't think it's necessarily

certain that you'll be able to attain service.

2

We're certainly hopeful that we will be able to

3

attain service under (a)(4) in the Kumar case,

4

but, again, you know, this Court has to give

5

effect to Congress's judgment.

6

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Are you aware of

7

any problems trying to effectuate service

8

generally under (a)(4)?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Does it -­

I mean, that's the

17

bottom line, right, is that if there is not a

18

diplomatic relationship, there are not going to

19

be diplomatic channels.

20

But I think, tellingly, the regulation

21

for (a)(4) service contemplates the possibility

22

of service of process at the embassy in the

23

United States of the foreign state, which I

24

think belies the notion that this is somehow

25

forbidden by the Vienna Convention.

In your research, did

you find a single example, any example of

someone tried (a)(4) and they couldn't get it

done?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I'm not aware of an

course, we're interpreting above all a federal

9

statute here.

I can't say that I've actually

hierarchy.

11

And, Justice Breyer, to the extent

12

that (a)(3) is unusual, I think the telling

fact is that Congress preferred (a)(3) service

14

to (a)(4) service.

That's right.
And I think that if

6

there would be such a case, it would be in a

7

context in which the United States has no

8

diplomatic relations and, therefore, there are

9

no diplomatic channels.

And, of course, that's

10

not an unlikely possibility in the event of a

11

state sponsor of terrorism, which is, after

12

all, the context in which (a)(3) is most likely

13

to be significant.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

have embassies in the United States where

situation.

But, of course, our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Counsel, the point

2

-- the point you're making is it's not a big

3

deal to allow service at an embassy, even

4

though the United States objects and even

5

though, as Justice Breyer points out, no other

6

country appears to allow that.

7

And -- and my response in addition to

8

that is, is it really a big deal to, from your

9

perspective going forward, I know about this

10

case, but going forward as a system, to go

11

through the (a)(4) mechanism rather than (a)(3)

12

at -- at an embassy?

13

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I would flip

14

that around and say that it's not a big deal to

15

permit service on the embassy under (a)(3) -­

16

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But that -­

-- precisely because a

18

country can adopt a policy and simply decide

19

not to accept (a)(3) service.

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But I -- if I were

21

starting afresh like the Chief Justice's first

22

question, I -- I might agree with you, but the

23

United States and all the countries in the

24

Vienna Convention all seem to say, actually, it

25

is a big deal.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But I think that there

2

are two separate questions.

3

the Vienna Convention prohibit service of

4

process by mail?

5

respectfully submit that all of the relevant

6

indicia -- the language of Article 22, the

7

drafting history, the commentary, including the

8

U.K. Supreme Court's decision in Reyes -- point

9

in our favor.

10

The first is, does

And there I would

The second is, what is the current

11

practice of other countries?

12

certainly true that (a)(3) is unusual with

13

regard to lawsuits against foreign sovereigns,

14

I don't think that it's as unusual with regard

15

to lawsuits against diplomatic personnel, like

16

the lawsuit at issue in Reyes.

17

And while it is

So the idea of service of process by

18

mail is not somehow alien.

19

Congress, in adopting (a)(3), did do something

20

a little bit unusual in providing a mechanism

21

for service of process by mail, even for

22

litigation against foreign sovereigns.

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's just that

What would be the

24

consequences in this particular case if you had

25

to go back and if we were to rule against you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65

and you succeed in achieving service under

2

(a)(4)?

3

would appear?

4

Is there any indication that Sudan

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I think that's a

5

question for Mr. Curran, but we would certainly

6

have to start over in this case.

7

that the reason why that is particularly

8

inequitable here is because, in this case, we

9

would essentially be held to have failed to

And I think

10

serve properly by failing to comply with a

11

requirement that does not appear on the face of

12

the statute and in a context in which Sudan

13

unquestionably had actual notice of the

14

litigation.

15

And, again, as this case comes to the

16

Court, it comes to the Court on the assumption

17

that Sudan accepted service here,

18

notwithstanding Sudan's late effort to cast

19

doubt on that proposition.

20

notwithstanding Sudan's judgment to accept

21

service under (a)(3), we would have to start

22

over at this late phase.

23

And so,

And we're not even talking about an

24

objection that was raised in the underlying

25

litigation.

We're talking about an objection

that was raised in the very -- at the very last

MR. CURRAN:

Justice Alito, Sudan is

committed to appearing and defending itself.

14

It believes that the default judgment was

ill-founded.

16

it would like to contest the charges.

17

It has substantial defenses, and

JUSTICE ALITO:

Is there -- do you

want to suggest that the -- the government of

didn't realize that this litigation was going

or after the default?

MR. CURRAN:

before the default judgment itself, okay?

That's -- that's my assessment of the record.

18

My -- my colleague, Mr. Shanmugam,

19

advocates a reading of 1608(a)(3) that is broad

and unpredictable and leaves too much

creativity for plaintiffs and courts.
