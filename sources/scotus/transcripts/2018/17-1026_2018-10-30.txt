CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

versus Idaho.

Mr. Ali.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF AMIR H. ALI

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9

11

MR. ALI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
In Flores-Ortega, a unanimous Court

12

held that where -- excuse me -- a unanimous

13

Court held where -- that where a defendant

14

pleads guilty and instructs his trial counsel

15

to notice an appeal, disregarding that

16

instruction renders ineffective assistance in

17

which prejudice is presumed.

18

The Court reached that conclusion even

19

though pleading guilty waives the vast majority

20

of claims that could be raised on appeal and

21

even though most defendants who plead guilty do

22

not ultimately succeed in their direct appeal.

23

The Court correctly concluded that

24

prejudice is presumed, both because a

25

defendant's disregard for the instruction to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

notice of an appeal forfeits the entire direct

2

appeal and because the attorney then usurps a

3

fundamental decision that rests with the client

4

alone.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Ali, when you

6

just described the relief that you seek, am I

7

right that you -- what you're seeking is

8

reinstatement of the right to appeal?

9

MR. ALI:

That's correct, Your Honor.

10

I think it -- I think that's a really critical

11

point because it shows that what Mr. Garza is

12

requesting here, what Petitioner is requesting,

13

is simply to restore the bargain that the

14

parties struck before his trial counsel usurped

15

his fundamental decision to appeal.

16

is seeking -­

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So all he

But what -- but

18

what happens -- what happens to the plea -­

19

plea bargain?

20

on waiving the right to appeal.

21

one argument that says all we're seeking is

22

right to appeal, we recognize that the plea

23

bargain goes by the boards because it was

24

conditioned on no appeal.

25

The plea bargain was conditioned

MR. ALI:

So I could see

So, no, that is not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

Mr. Garza's argument.

2

that the appeal would be reinstatement.

3

the parties before the Court agree that, even

4

though Mr. Garza signed an appeal waiver, that

5

certain fundamental claims survive that appeal

6

waiver.

7

The argument would be
All

So, when the appeal is reinstated, the

8

plea agreement will remain intact.

9

waiver will remain intact.

The appeal

To succeed on an

10

issue that is waived, Mr. Garza would have to,

11

and we think he actually has, a colorable claim

12

in this record that his appeal waiver was

13

involuntary.

14

maybe this is the better way to describe this.

15

And so all he is seeking to do -­

Consider two similarly situated

16

defendants, okay?

17

Both plea agreements contain an appeal waiver.

18

Both defendants instruct their counsel to go

19

ahead and perfect -- to notice an appeal.

20

Both sign a plea agreement.

In the first defendant's situation,

21

counsel follows that client's autonomous

22

choice.

23

parties before the court agree that an appeal

24

would be perfected, he will be appointed

25

counsel, he will get access to the record,

He files a notice of appeal.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

All

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

which would be required to identify issues for

2

appeal and make sure that the plea proceedings

3

proceeded in a way that is lawful and -- and -­

4

and legal and that the plea is valid, and then

5

there will be judicial review, either of the

6

merits of the claims raised, or if counsel's -­

7

appellate counsel believes that there is no

8

meritorious issues, the process in Anders will

9

be followed and there will still be judicial

10

review.

11
12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I thought that

--

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But he -- he gets

14

keep the -- I mean, this -- this was a plea

15

agreement that gave him fewer years than he

16

could have been subjected to under the law.

17

And so you're -- you're -- you say -- there was

18

one judge who said he wants his cake and eat it

19

too.

20

plea bargain and discards what's not good; that

21

is, no right to appeal.

22

That is, he keeps what's good about the

MR. ALI:

Well -- so, Your Honor, I

23

think a couple points in response.

It's -­

24

it's important to recognize that simply

25

noticing an appeal or, in this case,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

reinstating an appeal, it's hard to see how

2

that alone breaches the plea agreement.

3

And so the way this happens in

4

practice is that when an -- an appeal waiver is

5

signed, the government gains what is

6

effectively an affirmative defense that it can

7

raise on appeal.

8

It's not jurisdictional.

9

self-executing.

It can choose to raise it.
It's not

The government chooses to

10

raise it and satisfies the court of appeals

11

that the issue that appellate counsel has

12

actually raised on appeal is, in fact, within

13

the appeal waiver, then the government will

14

succeed and there will be consequences,

15

potentially, depending on what the -- the plea

16

agreement says the consequences should be.

17

All of that is what we're saying this

18

direct appeal is required to do.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, and if it's

20

determined -- I -- I think this -- I thought

21

this was the thrust of Justice Ginsburg's

22

question.

23

the appeal was in violation of the appeal

24

waiver, then the plea bargain has been broken

25

by the defendant.

If it is ultimately determined that

MR. ALI:
yes.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

And -- and it may be

void.

That's correct, Your Honor,

That's right.

and let me just make a -­

And what -- what -­
Whose choice is

that?

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

not the notice.

13

-- what breaches the

In other words, you said it's
What is it?

MR. ALI:

It is raising an issue that

14

is, in fact, within the scope of the appeal

15

waiver.

16

it was never disputed -- that there are certain

17

claims that survive, those going to the

18

validity of the plea and enforceability of the

19

plea.

20

limitations on the circumstances in which the

21

plea will or will not be enforced by a court of

22

appeals:

23

challenging the -- that the sentence was

24

imposed on certain unconstitutional

25

considerations.

So everyone agrees -- I believe that

There are certain constitutional

for instance, if the defendant is

And then, of course, there are

Official - Subject to Final Review

the issues that are outside the scope of the

2

appeal waiver, which can be certainly raised by

3

the defendant without any sort of consequence.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6
7

What if the -­

Are there any

states -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- what if the

8

issue that the defendant wants to raise is

9

clearly within the scope of the appeal waiver?

10

You know, he comes to a lawyer and says, I want

11

to appeal because I'm not guilty.

12

MR. ALI:

So -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

In other

14

words, I -- I think, you know, it was voluntary

15

and all that, and the -- it's not beyond the

16

constitutional limits.

17

So I -- I want to appeal.

18

MR. ALI:

I just am not guilty.

So, Your Honor, a few

19

responses.

20

have is, clear in whose view?

21

always recognized that there's a role for the

22

court in that sort of distinction.

23

I think the -- the first response I

possibility, and courts have dealt with that,

you know, for over 50 years under Anders.

5

it hasn't been a problem, and what it's

provided is the protections that that decision

7

was all about and has been applied by this

Court several times since.

The second response I have is -­

you're going a little too fast -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

breaking that down.

15

MR. ALI:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

defendant comes to you, you're a competent

agreement and put you into jail for a lot

What does
He

He tells the client:
You have a

You shouldn't appeal.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

You run

longer.

2

Do you really want to do this?
Now the client -- isn't the client the

3

one who has the right to appeal?

4

what we've said for dozens of cases?

5

MR. ALI:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Isn't that

That's correct, Your Honor.
The attorney can

7

decide what to appeal.

And so, if the client

8

tells you appeal, you put in your notice of

9

appeal.

And if you don't think there's a

10

viable issue, you file an Anders brief and you

11

tell the court there isn't.

12
13

The defendant then has -- is invited
to tell the court what it thinks, right?

14

MR. ALI:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

That's right.
And then the court

makes the decision, correct?

17

MR. ALI:

That's correct.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

With the client

19

deciding whether he wants to rescind the plea

20

agreement?

21

rescinding a contract, correct?

22
23
24
25

Nothing prohibits a defendant from

MR. ALI:

That's right, Your Honor,

although I don't think that our argument -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You suffer

consequences -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

MR. ALI:

-- is contingent on that,

2

that -- this idea of -- of autonomous right to

3

breach.

4

And -­

5

I think that is correct, though.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

6

that to be your position.

7

answers to my question.

You said you had two

8

MR. ALI:

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

I understood

Yeah, and -­
What was the

second one?

11

MR. ALI:

Sure.

And -- and Justice

12

Sotomayor touched on them, but let me just

13

repeat them.

14

way.

15

defendant has identified as the issue matters,

16

because a defendant doesn't make the decision

17

what issues will be raised on appeal.

18

the decision whether his objective is to

19

appeal.

20

So -- in a slightly different

So the second answer is why what the

He makes

And so what we would say is that when

21

a defendant articulates to his attorney, his

22

agent, if you will, that his objective is to

23

show that the plea proceedings that just took

24

place were unlawful, the attorney has no place

25

telling that defendant that he would prefer to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

just substitute his own view that the defendant

2

go off, cede defeat, and go to prison.

3

our position.

4

That is

And -- and that's why, as the Court

5

recognized in Jones v. Barnes, the person who

6

makes the decisions as to what issues will be

7

raised is the appellate attorney.

8

would be illogical to say that a defendant's

9

right to appeal, as the United States' argument

And so it

10

-- argues here, turns on his ability to

11

articulate certain issues.

12

And -- and remember, Your Honor, we're

13

talking about the notice of appeal stage here,

14

so the record typically hasn't been ordered

15

here.

16

in Idaho because that's triggered by the notice

17

of appeal.

18

It certainly wouldn't have been ordered

So you're asking an -- generally a

19

defendant with limited education, his exposure

20

to the legal system might be minutes, maybe

21

hours, to potentially specify certain issues

22

that might be in or outside the scope of his

23

waiver, and then you're asking his agent to

24

basically play judge and forfeit his appeal if

25

he alone thinks that the words that came out of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

the defendant's mouth happen to fall within the

2

waiver.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

But I think your

4

argument does ultimately depend on the

5

proposition that the defendant has this

6

categorical right based on autonomy to insist

7

on an appeal and have an attorney perfect the

8

appeal, file the notice of appeal, even if

9

there is zero chance that the appeal will be

10
11

found not to have been waived.
I think -- and maybe that's right, but

12

I -- I do think your argument depends on that.

13

And I wonder how that is consistent with the

14

way Flores-Ortega analyzed the question of

15

whether the attorney was deficient in that

16

situation.

17

If there is such a right, then why

18

wouldn't the attorney have the right to -- have

19

the obligation to consult with the -- with the

20

client and to tell the client that the client

21

has that right?

22

a very complicated fact-bound inquiry into

23

whether what the attorney did or called for

24

such an inquiry into whether what the attorney

25

did was deficient.

But, instead, it went through

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

MR. ALI:

So I think there are two

2

parts to your question.

3

whether our position is that -- so let me

4

answer this way.

5

So, first, as to

Our position is that the determination

6

of whether there are non-frivolous or

7

meritorious decisions doesn't take place.

8

may take place in a preliminary fashion during

9

the notice of appeal phase, but that's an issue

10
11

It

for appellate counsel.
And that risk, as I mentioned, that

12

there would be no meritorious issue that is to

13

be raised on appeal was, of course, present in

14

Flores-Ortega as well.

15

waived all non-jurisdictional claims that he

16

had, and so there was very much a possibility

17

of that there as well.

Mr. Flores-Ortega had

18

And -- and to answer the second part

19

of your question about what the Court said in

20

Flores-Ortega, the Court specifically

21

acknowledged there that pleading guilty

22

substantially reduced the number of claims that

23

Mr. Flores-Ortega could bring.

24
25

And in the very next sentence, it
acknowledged the possibility of what we have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

here.

2

expressly waive some claims in addition to

3

that.

4

It said that a defendant may also

And the relevance that it recognizes,

5

what we believe the relevance should be here,

6

which is that the act of signing -- of pleading

7

guilty and of signing an appeal waiver

8

represents a -- a -- an indication of finality,

9

an interest in finality on the part of the

10

defendant.

11

plead guilty, sign an appeal waiver, and then

12

instruct their attorney to appeal in the first

13

place.

14

And that's why few defendants will

And on top of that, in addition to

15

acting as a -- an indication of finality on the

16

part of the defendant, as the State and the

17

United States acknowledge and, in fact,

18

represent throughout their briefs, pleading

19

guilty, signing an appeal waiver, and then

20

having appellate counsel raise an issue that

21

even might fall within the appeal waiver can

22

have serious consequences for a defendant.

23

And so it acts and has acted as a sort

24

of natural check.

And that's why there really

25

is no evidence or certainly we would have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

expected the United States to provide evidence

2

to support its idea that there would be

3

frivolous appeals, for instance, following a

4

trial.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think we have to -­

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Ali -­

-- understand the

8

nature of the right that you're asserting, if I

9

could just come back to the Chief Justice's

10

question and perhaps embellish it a little.

11

So you have the -- you have a

12

defendant who is an expert on plea bargains and

13

plea waivers and knows everything about it.

14

This is a highly intelligent, educated person,

15

and signs a plea -- a plea agreement waiving

16

Issue A and then, as soon as the defendant is

17

sentenced, says to his attorney:

18

appeal Issue A.

19

I want to

And -- and I think your answer has to

20

be that the -- that that is the right of the

21

defendant and the obligation of the attorney to

22

carry out that -- the client's wishes.

23

right?

24

MR. ALI:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Am I

I think that's -­
That has to be your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18

position.

2

MR. ALI:

-- I think that's right,

3

Your Honor.

4

unrealistic scenario for most defendants.

5

I think it's largely an

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Ali, what do

6

you do with the jurisdictions that permit a

7

defense attorney to tell a client:

8

there's a meritorious issue, but I'm going to

9

give you the instructions on how to file your

10

I don't see

own notice of appeal?

11

There are other jurisdictions -- I

12

think the majority -- who require the attorney

13

to file the notice of appeal and then an Anders

14

brief.

15

When you're instructed by your client to file a

16

notice of appeal and you can't do it because

17

it's an ethical obligation -- an ethical

18

violation, you tell the client how to do it.

But what do we do with those that say:

19

MR. ALI:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

Right.

So let me just -­
Is that enough for

you?
MR. ALI:

Can I just clarify, this

23

particular record, Idaho does specifically

24

provide that if a attorney withdraws before the

25

notice of appeal is -- is filed, that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

defendant will be provided with new counsel.

2

And, of course, it was the very

3

representation of the defendant here that

4

prevented the defendant under -- under

5

procedural rules from filing a notice of appeal

6

himself.

7

--

8
9
10

And so that's why we know it caused a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yeah, the error

here was the attorney did nothing and ignored
-- claims to have done nothing -­

11

MR. ALI:

That's right.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

MR. ALI:

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

inquiries about the appeal.

16

MR. ALI:

-- and ignored -­

And so -­
-- repeated

And, of course, we agree

17

that counsel should have a conversation with

18

the defendant and say:

19

believe -- I don't have the record yet, he

20

should caveat it, I don't have the record yet,

21

this is a preliminary assessment during the

22

short window, but I think it's going to be very

23

difficult for you to argue around your appeal

24

waiver to raise this issue that Justice Alito

25

was describing, but he should still perfect the

We think -- you know, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

appeal, because what we're asking the attorney

2

to do is a ministerial task here once the

3

defendant has made its decision.

4

And we know that -- the United States

5

knows that better than anybody.

protective notice of appeal.

14

And the reason is -­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But what are the

16

practical differences between the consequences

17

of the position you're advocating and what

18

would happen if you were to lose this case?

19

If you win in the situation where the

20

attorney thinks there's no non-frivolous claim

21

to be raised on appeal, after the plea waiver,

22

the attorney, you say, will file an Anders

23

brief, right?

24

MR. ALI:

That's right.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So -- so -­
That's -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

that's one side of it.

2

side, if you were to lose, then the defendant

3

would not be entirely precluded from trying to

4

take an appeal with respect to issues that the

5

defendant thinks are outside of the plea

6

waiver, the defendant could bring a collateral

7

proceeding and argue that his attorney was

8

ineffective for failing to take an appeal based

9

on a plea waiver that didn't cover the issue.

10

And then the other

And the only difference I can see

11

depends on state law; namely, whether -- and

12

maybe there are other differences and you'll

13

tell me if I'm overlooking something -- whether

14

an attorney will be appointed for the defendant

15

in the post-conviction proceeding and whether

16

there will be a more stringent standard of

17

review.

18

But if state law didn't -- if state

19

law provided an attorney and didn't provide a

20

more stringent standard of review, what is the

21

practical difference?

22

MR. ALI:

So, Your Honor, of course,

23

92 percent of post-conviction defendants across

24

the country don't get counsel on

25

post-conviction review.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

But I think that one very important

2

collateral consequence was left out, in

3

addition to -- I think the difference in -- in

4

burdens is a significant one here.

5

talking about not just civil burdens, but this

6

Court's well aware of the added hurdles that

7

goes along with habeas proceedings that a

8

defendant would now have to go through, not

9

because he made any mistake, but because his

We're

10

agent failed to undertake a ministerial task.

11

But, sorry, to get to the other very

12

significant consequence, the failure to

13

preserve issues in -- before a conviction

14

becomes final by raising them on direct appeal

15

can forever prevent a defendant from raising

16

those issues collaterally.

17

So, in the federal system, as this

18

Court decided in Bousley, to raise a

19

voluntariness claim in a 2255 position, you

20

have to have first asserted that on direct

21

appeal.

22

example, if a defendant believes he has

23

evidence that he could introduce on habeas to

24

show involuntariness, okay, to show that his

25

counsel misled him, et cetera, outside of the

So, I mean, to make a very blunt

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

direct appeal record, if he doesn't get the

2

direct appeal in order to preserve that issue,

3

he will be prevented, unless he can prove

4

actual innocence -­

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I guess what I

6

left out is that the issue -- the claim in the

7

-- in the collateral proceeding would be

8

ineffective assistance of counsel.

9

MR. ALI:

Well, so then we're

10

attaching an additional burden.

11

to assert his -- his -- his involuntariness

12

claim, he's now going to have to show that it

13

would have been -- I take it to -- you to be

14

saying that he could assert that it was

15

ineffective not to raise involuntariness in the

16

direct appeal.

17

Just for him

So now he has to show that it was

18

unreasonable for counsel not to file it in the

19

direct appeal, and then it would have

20

prejudiced him, and we suddenly are back to

21

getting to the -- all of the merits, all of

22

what should have happened in the direct appeal

23

in the first instance, and shouldn't have

24

prevented the defendant from simply arguing

25

these issues in his post-conviction petition

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

without having procedurally defaulted it simply

2

because his state-appointed counsel, his agent,

3

didn't undertake a ministerial task.

4

And that is -­

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I would like to

6

understand better what happens, what are the -­

7

so the -- so the attorney is obliged to file

8

the notice of appeal.

9

most states, there is no right to an attorney

Then, as you said, in

10

on appeal.

11

the notice of appeal, and then the defendant is

12

just left there unrepresented?

13

So that's it.

MR. ALI:

The attorney files

Oh, I'm sorry, no, Your

14

Honor.

15

to counsel on direct appeal.

16

instances, when he's sent to post-conviction by

17

virtue of his counsel's failure to notice the

18

appeal, he will not have counsel.

19

very much a direct consequence of not filing

20

the appeal.

21

An attorney has a constitutional right
In virtually all

So that's

If, as we think the Court should, the

22

-- the bargain struck by the parties here is

23

restored and Mr. Garza's appeal is reinstated,

24

he will be appointed counsel under state law

25

and as is required by the federal constitution,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

and counsel will put forward arguments.

2

think in this record that there are -­

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And we

But you -- you want

4

to -- this is a question I started out with.

5

You want to reinstate his right to appeal and

6

you still -- it's still not clear to me what

7

remains of the plea bargain.

8

MR. ALI:

So -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because if -- if he

10

had a right to appeal, he would not have had a

11

-- a plea bargain that says I'm not going to

12

appeal.

13

MR. ALI:

So, Your Honor, when

14

Mr. Garza signed this plea bargain with the

15

State of Idaho, all -- both parties understood

16

that Mr. Garza was waiving his right to raise

17

certain issues, you know, a scope defined by

18

the language in the plea waiver -- the appeal

19

waiver, but was -- could still raise several

20

issues which my friends do not contest he can

21

raise on direct appeal.

22

So he would notice the appeal.

He

23

would still be bound by the terms of his plea

24

bargain, meaning the appeal waiver would still

25

apply in that appellate proceeding, but he can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

still raise, of course, any claim outside the

2

scope of the waiver, and that would be a

3

determination for the court with the assistance

4

of appellate counsel.

5

for instance, the voluntariness of it, whether

6

the government honored its -- its commitments

7

under the plea agreement.

8
9

And he can challenge,

All of those are issues that Idaho,
all the federal courts conclude can be raised

10

in a direct appeal proceeding, even when you

11

have signed an appeal waiver.

12

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Because the appeal

13

would -- an appeal waiver never precludes any

14

and all possible appeals?

15
16

MR. ALI:

That is what is undisputed

on this record.

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

18

MR. ALI:

Right.

And that -- that's what the

19

federal courts have concluded, that they're not

20

categorical.

21

And -- and I think it's important to

22

recognize that -- to think about how

23

unrecognizable the conception of trial counsel

24

we're dealing with when we apply the United

25

States or the State's test here.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

Essentially, what their tests would

2

have trial counsel do is listen to the words of

3

the client and determine whether the words were

4

the right words to be outside the scope of the

5

waiver, and give up that client's best chance,

6

simply because during the notice of appeal

7

window, trial counsel can't come up with an

8

issue or doesn't think the client said the

9

right things, give up his best chance of

10

proving his conviction unlawful -- is unlawful,

11

which is the implication of him having

12

instructed trial counsel to notice the appeal.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could -- could I -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. -­

-- get your take on

16

the question of when you're in breach.

17

said you're not in breach when the notice of

18

appeal is filed.

19

what the notice of appeal says?

20

You

And is that true no matter

In other words, suppose the notice of

21

appeal is an opportunity to lay out your claims

22

and you lay out claims that are within the

23

waiver.

24

breach the agreement?

25

Does that still, in your view, not

MR. ALI:

Yes, I think so, Your Honor,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

because, in Idaho, for instance, the rules are

2

very clear that even with respect to the issues

3

you specify -- and generally speaking, in

4

federal court, we're talking about identifying

5

the order you're appealing from.

6

aren't required to specify issues.

7

insofar as you specify issues, it's very clear

8

that you're not bound once the appeal is begun.

9

So the way that would play out is that

Parties
In Idaho,

10

a notice of appeal would be filed.

11

wouldn't be a strong claim of breach then

12

because, as all agree, there are claims that

13

could be raised which would not be breached -­

14

breached even if they were resolved on the

15

merits, and the government would move to

16

dismiss the claim with the expedient procedures

17

that are available in Idaho and federal courts.

18

There

And if, at that point, no particular

19

issue can be raised that's outside the scope of

20

the waiver, what happens in some of these cases

21

is the defendant just decides to dismiss the

22

appeal altogether.

23

So no harm done.

But, if the only issues the defendant

24

can identify are within the scope of the

25

waiver, you've got a claim of breach.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And -­

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1
2

and the next question would be whether it's -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

In -- in other words,

3

if -- if there's -- if the defendant files a

4

brief that raises issues within the scope of

5

the waiver?

6

MR. ALI:

That's right.

And that

7

would be determined by the court of appeals,

8

whether it's within the scope of the waiver.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And how about if

10

there's an Anders brief that -- that raises

11

issues within the scope of the waiver?

12

that breach the defendant's bargain?

13

MR. ALI:

Does

Well, the way that Anders

14

plays out is that counsel is required to -- to

15

file a brief, as -- as I think Your Honor's

16

question is suggesting, and -- and the pro se

17

litigant is also given an opportunity to file a

18

brief under Anders.

19

the court.

20

And those are reviewed by

You know, I think it's -- if -- if the

21

pro se litigant himself in his brief is

22

asserting claims that are in the scope of the

23

waiver, I think there would be a strong claim

24

of breach in that instance.

25

If counsel is not actually pressing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

claims within the scope of the waiver, and -­

2

and the government's generally not required to

3

respond to Anders briefs, right, so it's the

4

attorney raising issues that are pointing the

5

court in a very important way to potential

6

issues in the case but isn't actually asserting

7

issues, I don't think that would be a breach.

8

I don't think our position turns one

9

way or the other on that position.

10

Counsel -­
Are you -- I'm

sorry.

13
14

But -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, please, go

ahead.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Are -- are -- just

16

to go through this, are you aware of whether

17

the federal system or state system would deny a

18

defendant another attorney if, under

19

Flores-Ortega, it's found that an attorney was

20

directed to file an appeal, didn't do it;

21

hence, he was ineffective under Flores-Ortega?

22

When the defendant went back down, would he or

23

would he not get another attorney?

24
25

MR. ALI:

I think he probably would.

In this case, factually speaking, he -- he

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

would because, on appeal, Idaho provides that

2

the state appellate defender comes in.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I'm just

4

asking because I'm not aware, at least from my

5

old circuit -­

6

MR. ALI:

Yeah.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that we would

8

have not appointed a new attorney once one has

9

been found ineffective.

Now that new attorney

10

could file an Anders brief, could do anything

11

permissible under the rules.

12

don't know enough about the other

13

jurisdictions.

14

most wouldn't.

15

But my point is I

I'd be sorely surprised that

MR. ALI:

I think that's right.

And I

16

just would add one thing, which is that these

17

claims actually could go very well to that

18

attorney's conduct, the attorney who is

19

usurping his client's decision to appeal.

20

if we're talking about the voluntariness,

21

counsel's performance at the plea hearing, et

22

cetera, could be tied up in those.

23

all the more reason in this instance not to

24

allow an attorney to override his client's

25

autonomous decision to appeal.

So,

And that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

And if I could, Mr. Chief Justice -­

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

3

Counsel -- if I

might.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6

Sure.

Thank you.

One

quick question.

7

You rely a lot on the autonomy of the

8

client, and we certainly have a lot of cases

9

saying, you know, a decision whether to appeal

10

or make a major decision like that belong to

11

the client.

12

Here, though, we have a complicating

13

factor that the autonomy's already been

14

expressed through the plea waiver and it's

15

presumptively correct given that it's a final

16

judgment of a trial court at that moment at

17

least.

18

What do we do about that?

So autonomy

19

runs both ways here in this particular

20

instance, and presumed prejudice in this

21

circumstance, is there some tension between

22

that and the fact that we don't presume

23

prejudice even when lawyers make really bad,

24

obviously wrong strategic, tactical decisions

25

in cases all the time?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

How do we reconcile that where even -­

2

even in obvious circumstances we don't presume

3

prejudice?

4

going to be non-prejudicial, right?

5

we do about those problems?

6

MR. ALI:

And, here, most of these cases are
So what do

So let me -- I think there

7

are two separate questions there.

Let me try

8

to answer them.

9

States make the first argument you suggested,

So the State and the United

10

which is that autonomy has been exercised at

11

time 1 when the waiver of appeal is signed.

12

Now, of course, one can't claim to

13

respect autonomy without looking at the actual

14

autonomous decision that is made.

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

16

a whole, we've -- it's complicated.

17

muddled, right?

18

MR. ALI:

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

20

Well, I think -­

MR. ALI:

At time 1, the autonomous

decision is to waive certain claims.

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

24

MR. ALI:

25

It's

are complicated.

21
22

But looking at it as

Yeah.

At time 2, the decision

is -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

2

MR. ALI:

3

Yeah.

-- go file a notice of

appeal because I still have other claims.

4

And to answer the second point really

5

quickly, when this Court looks at a situation

6

in which a proceeding has been provided to the

7

defendant and there are certain errors, a

8

client's not entitled -- or a defendant is not

9

entitled to a perfect proceeding, then, yes, in

10

that circumstance, to presume prejudice, you

11

look for those circumstances where prejudice is

12

so likely that, you know, it should be

13

presumed.

14

Now the United States all but concedes

15

that that doesn't apply in this circumstance.

16

If you look at the bottom of page 12, top of

17

page 13, after they do all of the posturing,

18

saying you should be identifying the most

19

likely circumstances, they say:

20

Court has also recognized that when you forfeit

21

an entire proceeding, a proceeding which is a

22

contingency -- or is an important part of

23

reaching finality, that that's not the inquiry

24

the court goes through.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Mr. Jorgensen.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KENNETH K. JORGENSEN

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

MR. JORGENSEN:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

7

My friend keeps referring to a waiver

8

of issues, but there was no waiver of issues in

9

this case.

10

There was a waiver of a procedure.

There was an appellate waiver.

11

Thus, in similar situations like this

12

where there is an appeal waiver, there has been

13

a waiver of a proceeding, not just of those

14

issues.

15

provides a very good example of that.

16

And I think this case actually

The plea agreement in this case that

17

was signed by Mr. Garza contains many

18

provisions.

19

that he would plead guilty to certain charges,

20

that the State would not then bring -- bring

21

other charges and would dismiss an enhancement.

22

Mr. Garza agreed to the particular sentence he

23

would receive.

24
25

Some of those provisions include

The plea agreement lists many of the
-- lists the rights that are required to be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

given under Idaho's Rule 11, which is the

2

substantive equivalent to Federal Rule 11.

3

Thus, even without the appeal waiver, the State

4

had basically assured itself of victory on

5

appeal.

6

It had -- it had already secured the

7

waiver of many, many, many issues, in fact, all

8

of the reasonable issues that could be tried.

9
10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, many but

certainly not all.

11

MR. JORGENSEN:

Not all.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

They haven't

13

-- they didn't assure themselves of victory on

14

appeal since there were arguments outside the

15

scope of the agreement, including some that

16

have to be available outside the scope of the

17

agreement -­

18

MR. JORGENSEN:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

That's correct.
-- that could

have been the basis for an appeal.

21

MR. JORGENSEN:

Well, that's correct

22

insofar as it goes, and that's one of the

23

reasons why this has to be a fact-by-fact

24

analysis.

25

In this case, Mr. Garza clearly did

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

waive the appellate procedure to all of those

2

issues that he could conceivably waive it to.

3

So he waived appellate procedure to

4

address his sentences.

5

appellate procedure to address his sentences.

6

He had no right to any

Had he filed the appeal, he had his

7

attorney file the notice of appeal, and raise

8

the issues Mr. Garza wanted, a challenge to his

9

sentence, the only thing he would have gotten

10

was a -- a preliminary proceeding to determine

11

whether he was asserting a waived procedure.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you have -­

13

could you address Flores-Ortega?

14

MR. JORGENSEN:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Certainly.
Because the way it

16

approached the issue was pretty clear.

17

said, in deciding whether counsel is

18

ineffective, first you determine whether a

19

defendant would have appealed.

20

And it said there's two ways to make

21

that determination.

22

waiver?

23

appealed.

24

he wanted to appeal?

25

It

A, was there a plea

If yes, then he wouldn't have
Or, second, did he tell the attorney

And this is the second of those.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

I can't square your position with Flores-Ortega

2

because Flores-Ortega seemed to accept as a

3

working proposition that given that there is

4

even, in a guilty plea, there are waivers of

5

some issues but not others, that the question

6

of whether a defendant would have appealed

7

takes into account the plea waiver at that

8

stage, but once a defendant tells an attorney

9

to appeal, that's his choice.

10
11

I don't know how to get around Ortega,
Flores-Ortega.

12

MR. JORGENSEN:

Well, first off,

13

Flores-Ortega does not address that

14

circumstance where there are both.

15

says there's no duty to consult where there is

16

a waiver.

17

provide the appeal if it's requested.

18

It clearly

It also says that there is a duty to

23

what's both here.

24

Flores-Ortega.

25

So Flores-Ortega does not

3

don't have to consult.

for one, you have to file a notice of appeal.

type of conflicting guidance -- in other words,

this was a waiver that was secured through the

13

direction of counsel.

14

with this.

15

Counsel was involved

So counsel had some idea of what Mr.

16

Garza's intent was at the time he signed the

17

plea agreement.

change his mind, to have his cake and eat it

19

too or to game the system or however you want

to phrase it, doesn't necessarily -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That Mr. Garza decided to

not understand the system?

a right, I mean, to even an Anders brief?

Because that tells you why you can't appeal.

MR. JORGENSEN:

Well -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Under your -­

10

under your position that you're not -- you've

11

forfeited your right to appeal altogether.

12

MR. JORGENSEN:

Our position is that

13

in post-conviction, where we are evaluating the

14

conduct of counsel in making this choice, that

15

we have to look at the totality of the

16

circumstances.

17

And in this case, the totality

18

includes the waiver.

19

specific instruction of the client.

20

totality includes the scope of the waiver and

21

counsel's determination that his client was

22

specifically asking him to seek an appeal that

23

would address an issue within the scope.

24
25

The totality includes the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

Mr. Jorgensen, so on

what you just said, I guess I was a little bit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41

confused in your brief as to the scope of your

2

argument.

3

Suppose that the client had, you know,

4

after doing the appeal waiver, but there are

5

some issues that you could still bring, not

6

very many, but some, and the client says:

7

want you to -- to his attorney -- I want you to

8

appeal.

9

guidance.

I

And he does not give any further
In other words, he doesn't say what

10

particular issues or whether those issues are

11

inside or outside the scope of the appeal

12

waiver.

13

He just thinks:

I want to appeal now.

Does he get to -- at that point, does

14

the attorney have to take the appeal?

15

presume prejudice from the fact that the

16

attorney has not taken the appeal?

17

MR. JORGENSEN:

Can you

At that point, you can

18

presume neither deficient performance nor

19

prejudice because that may, for example,

20

originate a duty to consult with the client, to

21

actually ascertain whether the client wants to

22

try to vitiate the entire plea agreement, to

23

ascertain whether the client really wants to

24

just test the state and see if they will maybe

25

not act on a direct breach of the plea

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42

agreement.

2

There are several different things the

3

client may be trying to achieve.

4

Mr. Garza alleged that he was trying to achieve

5

at any point is an appeal of his sentence.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

And all that

So that -- I

7

guess that I had understood your brief as

8

saying that as long as you don't specifically

9

want to appeal something that's within the

10

scope of the waiver, then the attorney does, in

11

fact, have to file a notice of appeal and you

12

can say that there is prejudice when he

13

doesn't.

14

But -- but -- but you're saying that

15

even if the client makes a kind of generalized

16

go file an appeal for me, I leave it to you,

17

what -- how -- you know, I don't know the law,

18

you go do it, and the attorney doesn't file

19

anything, even then you would say that there's

20

no presumption?

21

MR. JORGENSEN:

Yes.

We would say

22

that there's no presumption.

In other words,

23

before the attorney could actually undermine

24

the plea agreement, do something that would end

25

up with the state bringing the new charges,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

possibly seeking to put Mr. Garza away for

2

life, the attorney would have to secure Mr.

3

Garza's approval of that course of action.

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But doesn't that run

5

counter to our normal division of labor between

6

clients and lawyers?

7

specify the end, I wish to appeal, and leave it

8

to the lawyer to determine the means?

9

Don't clients generally

And doesn't it become incumbent at

10

that stage upon the lawyer to identify whether

11

there are any viable issues for appeal and come

12

back to the client and say there are some or

13

there are not some?

14

why isn't the failure to do that presumptively

15

prejudicial?

16

And a failure to do that,

MR. JORGENSEN:

The failure to do that

17

could conceivably be presumptively prejudicial

18

depending on our facts.

19

the question you just asked, you talked about

20

the end.

21

And I guess, in -- in

And I would suggest that the end is

22

not the filing of the notice of appeal but the

23

ultimate goal of the client.

24

wishes to ultimately keep his agreement and he

25

only wants his sentences possibly reduced, and

If the client

2

the waiver's existence -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- what is the

4

answer?

5

people are making a fairly simple argument,

6

very clear, very simple?

7

where there's a guilty plea.

What is your answer to what I think

There are trials

Now we hope that at those trials or
plea proceedings there are very few errors,

10

indeed, we hope none.

11

lawyer and says:

12

But a client goes to the

Appeal.

He has to appeal.

Now, here, we have a no appeal

13

agreement, but there are some errors that could

14

be made.

15

but there could be some.

16

We hope there are none or very few,

So why shouldn't it be exactly the

17

same rule if you, client, say to the lawyer:

18

Appeal, he has to appeal.

19

it he figures there's no decent issue here, he

20

writes an Anders brief.

21

Now, if on examining

Now why draw a line?

Why complicate

22

the law?

23

perhaps confused, unknowledgeable defendant who

24

occasionally is right?

25

Why make it more difficult for the

MR. JORGENSEN:

I mean, why?
Well, first off,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45

Strickland is the general standard.

2

we're -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

And all

Yeah, but it's

4

exactly the same.

5

case, no agreement, we say if the client asks

6

you, you have to do it, even without prejudice,

7

because he has been deprived of a lawyer at a

8

critical stage of the proceeding and we presume

9

prejudice.

10

We say, on the ordinary

Now why not say identical thing?

By

11

the way, if he doesn't ask you, well, then, if

12

there really is a good reason, you should have

13

appealed anyway.

14

that because that isn't in this case.

15
16

But we don't have to go into
Okay?

So, again, same question, why draw
such a line?

17

MR. JORGENSEN:

For a couple of

18

reasons.

First off, the general Strickland

19

standard is sufficient to catch those instances

20

where there is a mistake, where -- where trial

21

counsel has not behaved in a manner that is

22

acceptable, that meets those minimum

23

constitutional requirements.

24

And, second off, generally, where this

25

Court will apply a presumption, it is under the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

expectation that applying that presumption will

2

reach the correct result in most cases, most

3

instances.

4

Here, the presumption's going to lead

5

to an incorrect result in most instances,

6

simply because the waiver is ultimately going

7

to be enforced.

8

in this case that the waiver would have

9

ultimately been enforced.

10

So there's no reason to doubt

And it's certainly not a -- a

11

difficult burden to put on Mr. Garza and those

12

like him, to put some reason to believe the

13

waiver would not have been enforced in relation

14

to his appeal.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's disheartening,

16

because we would hope that in trials and in

17

guilty -- guilty plea proceedings, there are

18

also very few grounds for appeal.

19

And you're saying -- I see your point.

20

Your point is, oh, there are a lot there, but

21

there aren't many here.

22

you see, I -- I -- I find that a difficult

23

ground to use as making this distinction, if

24

for no other reason that I have no idea if

25

that's true or not.

Hmm.

I hope that -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

8

appeal.

9

are very few.

10

That there are lots
There are

I would hope in all those cases there

I don't know, and so I find it hard to

11

draw -- write an opinion which said the reason

12

you don't get exactly the same right is because

13

you have fewer likely grounds for appeal.

14

MR. JORGENSEN:

Well, I think that the

15

right -- again, it's not just a limitation of

the issues you can raise on appeal.

17

18

in certain limited circumstances.

JUSTICE ALITO:

It is a

Is there any practical

difference in -- differences between the

21

consequences of taking a hopeless appeal when

22

there is no plea -- when there is no appeal

23

waiver and the consequences of taking a

24

hopeless appeal that is covered by a plea

25

waiver?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

MR. JORGENSEN:

Yes, there is.

And

2

the reason is that, for example, had there been

his sentence, the court would have dealt with

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Counsel, in

addition to Justice Breyer's question of why

16

complicate the law, or on top of that question,

17

what practical harm has there been in those

jurisdictions, those areas, that have applied

the presumption?

presumption.

Because I haven't seen much

MR. JORGENSEN:

Well, it is -- it is

23

true that most courts deal with these fairly

24

quickly and summarily up front.

25

argue that that's a reason why there -- there

But we would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

shouldn't be this generalized rule, a -- a

2

bright-line rule that's going to just simply

get that is -- is probably not a good

4

bright-line rule.

5
6

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But -- but it's

very simple, I think you're agreeing -­

7

MR. JORGENSEN:

Yes.

8

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- for the court

9

when they get an appeal, so to pick up Justice

10

Ginsburg's point, if the appeal is reinstated,

11

you get the appeal, well, most issues are

12

probably going to be within the scope of the

13

waiver and then there might be, in some cases,

14

something outside the scope of the waiver.

15

Oftentimes those are not meritorious, of

16

course, and are quickly dealt with.

17

they are, though.

18

Sometimes

It seems pretty simple for most

19

appellate courts to deal with that, and I'm not

20

sure there's any evidence of a problem.

21

there's not evidence of a problem, why

22

complicate the law, as Justice Breyer says?

MR. JORGENSEN:

What the state gets

out of these types of agreements is the

procedure itself.

2

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But -- but -- I'm

acknowledged that the appeal waiver gives up

circumstances.

up everything.

Right.
And that goes to

An appeal waiver never gives

It can't.

11

MR. JORGENSEN:

Right.

12

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

It can't.

And

13

because it never can give up everything, you've

14

never actually forfeited the entire procedure.

15

MR. JORGENSEN:

That's right.

But

16

there -- but it -- it would require a minimal

17

showing to show that ultimately the appeal that

18

the defendant wanted and had a right to was one

19

of these things outside of the scope of the

20

waiver.

21

And I think that that's the crucial

22

difference here.

Mr. Garza, in the

23

post-conviction case, was asked specifically,

24

what issue would you raise on appeal if I

25

reinstate your appeal rights?

The district

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

court asked in that decision.

2

answer was:

And Mr. Garza's

My sentence.

3

So it would -- it would not be an

4

onerous burden for somebody with an appeal

5

waiver challenging the decision of counsel to

6

say, you know what, I can convince this court

7

that I would have raised one of the

8

automatically excluded areas.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

I think Mr. -- I think

10

Mr. Ali said that -- that Garza would like to

11

raise the issue of the voluntariness of his

12

agreement.

13
14

MR. JORGENSEN:

No, Your Honor.

He

never said that in the state courts.

15
16

Is that still an open question?

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, has there been a

decision on that issue by any state court?

17

MR. JORGENSEN:

The district court at

18

I believe pages 31 through 32 -- or, excuse me,

19

30 through 32a of the appendix on the -- the

20

petition, the district court specifically asked

21

Garza, what issues do you wish to raise on

22

appeal?

23

what would you pursue?

24

limited it to the sentence issue.

25

specifically, the court noted that Mr. Garza

If -- if we reinstated your right,
And he specifically

waiver.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

looking at page 5 of the brief, the blue brief,

and so you didn't write it, but it says that,

with him, didn't get that information?

21

MR. JORGENSEN:

No.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Your answer would

23

be if the attorney wasn't told that by his

24

client because the attorney never asked his

25

client, that that's not ineffective assistance

Heritage Reporting Corporation

of counsel in this situation where the attorney

asked him to file a notice of appeal?

MR. JORGENSEN:

in fact, what he wanted and his attorney failed

to ascertain that through consultation.

MR. KEDEM:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:

2

A prejudice inquiry under Strickland

3

is the normal tool for identifying which final

criminal judgments should be reopened based on

5

counsel's ineffective assistance.

6

That is, cases where the harm to

finality is justified by increased accuracy and

reliability, the court should not abandon that

9

case-specific inquiry here, where any benefits

10

would exist only in exceptional cases.

A lot of the focus of argument today

12

has been on the question whether counsel has an

13

obligation to file a notice of appeal under

14

various circumstances.

deficient performance.

16

That is the question of

I'd like to refocus the Court, if I

17

may, on the question of prejudice, which is the

18

one that we have focused on in our brief.

19

The question there, we think, is

20

governed by Flores-Ortega.

21

requires for a showing of prejudice that there

22

be case-specific circumstances that show that

23

the defendant was prejudiced by his counsel's

24

errors.

25

Strickland always

What Flores-Ortega tells us is that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

once you know that the reason that the

2

defendant lost out on an appellate proceeding

3

to which he had a right, because of what

4

counsel did, that automatically is prejudicial.

5
6

You don't have to know whether he was
going to win his appeal.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8

answer the question here?

9

MR. KEDEM:

10
11

But why doesn't that
Because -­

Sure.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- there's

undoubtedly a statutory right to appeal.

12

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And the waiver is

14

only good if it's asserted.

15

government fails to assert it in a timely

16

fashion in the courts of appeals, and the

17

courts of appeals just disregard the waiver all

18

together.

19

MR. KEDEM:

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And often the

Right.
It is in the nature

21

of an affirmative defense that you'd lose if

22

you don't use.

23

So why isn't it the denial in a

24

proceeding to which the defendant is entitled

25

by law?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

MR. KEDEM:

So the question is not

2

merely whether he would have filed a notice of

3

appeal and submitted some brief that the court

4

would have read, if we know based on the

5

circumstances that the court would just have

6

thrown out the proceeding at the threshold -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

I read what it says

8

in Flores-Ortega.

Maybe I only got it in part,

9

but it says the court noted failure to file a

10

notice of appeal is "the complete denial of

11

counsel during a critical stage of a judicial

12

proceeding," a situation ordinarily requires a

13

"presumption of prejudice."

14
15

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

But

elsewhere it -­

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So I take that

17

to mean if your client asks you, the lawyer,

18

file a notice of appeal, you've got to do it.

19

And if you don't do it, it's automatically

20

prejudice.

21

Now isn't -- isn't -- and my question

22

was, well, why isn't that exactly the same

23

here?

24

that that's what Flores-Ortega says, or am I

25

wrong that this is the same?

Now which part am I wrong?

Am I wrong

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. KEDEM:

So Flores-Ortega certainly

2

says what you're talking about -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

MR. KEDEM:

All right.

-- but it also clarifies

5

elsewhere that the type of appeal to which

6

we're talking about is an appeal to which the

7

defendant has a right, which is to say a merits

8

proceeding.

9

If a defendant, for instance, asks to

10

appeal to the wrong court, he wants to appeal

11

to the Ninth Circuit rather than to an Idaho

12

state appellate court, no one would say that if

13

his attorney declines to file that notice of

14

appeal, knowing that it would just be tossed

15

out without any consideration of the merits of

16

his claims, that the defendant has been

17

prejudiced in the sense that -- that the Sixth

18

Amendment cares about, because Strickland uses

19

the term prejudice -­

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21

legal right to that kind of appeal?

22

MR. KEDEM:

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Because he has no

That's correct.
But he does have a

24

legal right to appeal to the court -- relevant

25

court of appeals.

That is a statutory right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Now perhaps Congress could change that

and say in appeal waivers cases, you know, I'm

sure the government can go seek that, but for

now at least, there's a statutory right to

appeal to the right court.

complication you've added.

11

MR. KEDEM:

Well, let me give you

12

another example.

Let's say five years after

13

his conviction the defendant says to his

14

attorney:

I want to file a notice of appeal.

15

And there's no jurisdictional defect

16

because the timing of a notice of appeal in a

17

criminal case is not jurisdictional.

18

attorney declines because he knows that there

19

would be no consideration of the merits -­

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

If the

21

And there may be no

25

what Justice Breyer is trying to aim at.

maybe you could too.

Right.
Let's look at the

10

Anders briefs filed in those cases where there

11

was no waiver.

12

MR. KEDEM:

Sure.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

14

MR. KEDEM:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean -­

You know -­
-- none of those

16

cases did he have a really good argument, or

17

the lawyer wouldn't have filed an Anders brief.

18

MR. KEDEM:

So -- so here is why we

19

think it is different in a case where the

20

defendant just has bad arguments of the sort

21

that might get asserted in an Anders brief.

22

You still know there that if a notice

23

of appeal is filed, that there will be review

24

on the merits.

25

appeal, which is what happens in the case of an

4

appellate waiver.

5

It's not going to dismiss the

And so what Flores-Ortega tells us is

6

we care about the type of error that would

7

undermine our faith in the reliability of the

8

proceedings, but if all you've lost out on is

9

an opportunity to have your claims tossed out

10

without any merits review whatsoever,

11

Flores-Ortega does not tell us that that type

12

of loss counts as prejudice.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Do you think we can

14

get anything out of the question whether the

15

defendant has a legal right to file some thing

16

there?

17

and under rules, defendants have the right to

18

do all sorts of things during a criminal

19

proceeding, but for almost all of those, the

20

decision is made by the attorney?

21

Isn't it the case that, under statutes

MR. KEDEM:

That's correct.

The

22

question is more about whether the loss of a

23

proceeding undermines our faith in the

24

reliability of the criminal judgment.

25

If the answer there is no, then the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

defendant hasn't lost anything that the Sixth

2

Amendment was designed to protect.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

Sorry.

Maybe this I

just -- I don't understand.

5

We have a trial or a guilty plea.

6

defendant says appeal; he files an Anders

7

brief.

8

MR. KEDEM:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

The

That's correct.
And what you're

10

saying is the court will read it, he has a

11

chance to file his own, and then it will write

12

the word affirmed, all right?

13

So now what we have is this case.

He

14

might have some good arguments, you know, he

15

might, but the lawyer thinks not.

16

lawyer says:

17

looked through it, there's nothing to it, and

18

they don't write the word affirmed?

And the

I filed an Anders brief, I've

19

MR. KEDEM:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you know that they

21

don't write the word affirmed, rather, that

22

23

that, you know.

24

doesn't mean it isn't true.

25

MR. KEDEM:

Well, Justice Breyer -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63

JUSTICE BREYER:

Do you know that the

2

court of appeals writes the word dismissed and

3

not the word affirmed?

4

MR. KEDEM:

That's right.

In our

5

brief, we have a footnote citing decisions from

6

every circuit in the federal system -­

7
8
9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Where they'll say

dismissed and not affirmed?
MR. KEDEM:

-- in which they dismiss.

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

So that's

11

what the difference really comes down to in

12

your mind?

13

MR. KEDEM:

It's -- it's -- that is

14

one technical difference, but I think it also

15

goes to the question:

Are they reviewing the

16

claims on the merits?

When there's a loss of a

17

proceeding in which no merits review occurs,

18

that doesn't undermine our faith in the

19

reliability of the proceedings.

20

It's also important to note that an

21

appellate waiver doesn't just make the

22

likelihood of success on appeal lower.

23

additional obstacle that would prevent the

24

defendant's claims even from getting

25

consideration.

It's an

And so, if we want to rule out

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

that obstacle, we have to do some additional

2

investigation.

3

We can look either to direct evidence

4

that the defendant was on the verge of

5

appealing some claim that would have gotten

6

merits consideration, or, if we don't have

7

direct evidence based on communications or

8

contemporaneous evidence, we can look to the

9

existence of some non-frivolous claim outside

10

the scope of the waiver that the defendant had

11

which provides circumstantial evidence that had

12

a notice of appeal been filed, he would have

13

appealed some claim that got merits review.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

How does that fit

15

with the usual breakdown of responsibilities

16

between client and lawyer where we normally

17

assume that clients only specify objectives or

18

ends and that the lawyer has the obligation

19

under our ethical rules and, mostly -- most of

20

our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence to -- to pick

21

the appropriate means?

22

So, if a client says I wish to appeal

23

anything that's possible, why isn't that a

24

necessary directive to the lawyer to figure out

25

which possible things fall outside the waiver

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

or -- or those sorts of things?

2

client have to come forward and identify the

3

winning argument?

4

MR. KEDEM:

Why does a

So, again, we're not

5

talking about counsel's obligations or the

6

client's obligations on direct review.

7

we're on collateral review, trying to figure

8

out why it was that the defendant either was or

9

wasn't harmed, the normal burden under

When

10

Strickland is that a defendant who seeks to

11

reopen an otherwise final judgment has the

12

burden in all cases to establish that he was

13

prejudiced.

14

Now it may be that, as a theoretical

15

matter, any defendant could always challenge

16

something outside the scope of his waiver.

17

could always challenge, for instance, whether

18

his plea was voluntary.

19

with the assumption for all cases that all

20

defendants are intending to challenge, for

21

instance, the voluntariness of their pleas.

22

He

But we shouldn't start

Not only does that invert the normal

23

burden of proof under Strickland, it's contrary

24

to experience.

25

It's also contrary to what this Court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

has said about frivolous appeals; namely -­

2

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

In terms of

3

experience, does the federal government think

4

that the experience of those circuits that have

5

applied a presumption of prejudice has shown a

6

problem?

7

MR. KEDEM:

So it's a problem only

8

that it leads to the reinstatement of

9

additional frivolous appeals.

We're not saying

10

that it's such a big problem that the sky is

11

going to fall in, but it does create a couple

12

practical problems.

13

Number one, in addition to additional

14

frivolous appeals, there are a lot of circuits

15

that don't act on motions to dismiss on the

16

basis of waivers until after full briefing on

17

the argument -- on the merits, which means the

18

government loses a lot of the benefit of its

19

bargaining.

20

The second one is that when you're on

21

collateral review, you end up focusing just on

22

the evidentiary question, the very difficult

23

evidentiary question, whether the defendant

24

actually asked for a notice of appeal, which

25

can be burdensome to prove.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF AMIR H. ALI

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3
4

MR. ALI:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

5

I just want to really make one point,

6

maybe with two parts, responding to the United

7

States' suggestion that really we're dealing

8

here with a -- a -- a formalistic or symbolic

9

appeal.

And I just want to do it on the

10

context of this record with the real practical

11

consequences this could have for Mr. Garza.

12

As we note on page 32 of our opening

13

brief, Mr. Garza here has a very colorable, I

14

think meritorious claim, that his appeal waiver

15

was involuntary.

16

We address the specific facts there,

17

which include shortly before his second plea,

18

indicating on a form that he was not waiving

19

his right to appeal; going into two plea

20

hearings, neither of which inquired, as

21

required under state law under Rule 11, into

22

whether he was waiving his right to appeal; and

23

then being advised three times in -- once in

24

the hearing and twice in judgments, that he had

25

a right to appeal.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And -- and I just want to note that

2

that claim could not be raised on

post-conviction.

4

whether it was raised and dealt with.

5

answer is no.

6

Justice Alito, you asked
The

The very pages that were referred to

7

you -- that you were referred to by the State,

8

the district court says:

9

Mr. Garza to be challenging the voluntariness

I do not understand

10

of his appeal waiver.

I see his pro se

11

petition as only addressing the voluntariness

12

of his plea agreement as a whole.

13

So even though the lack of advice at

14

the Rule 11 hearing would seem to support his

15

claim, I will not consider it that way.

16

And if I could just finish in

17

summation by saying that the substantial

18

majority of the circuits have adopted the rule

19

Petitioner proposed in this case.

20

circuits account for approximately 95 percent

21

of the guilty pleas in the federal system, and

22

no problems have been shown with that rule, we

23

ask the Court to adhere to it where, as here, a

24

defendant satisfies a court that he wanted to

25

challenge the lawfulness of the proceedings he
