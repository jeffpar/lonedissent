CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

argument next in Case 17-765, United States

5

versus Stitt, and Case Number 17-766, United

6

States versus Sims.

Ms. Ross.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERICA ROSS

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MS. ROSS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The crime of burglary has always

13

focused on dwellings.

14

adopted the current version of the Armed Career

15

Criminal Act in 1986, the vast majority of

16

states had burglary statutes protecting all

17

types of homes, including the non-permanent and

18

mobile dwellings at issue in these cases.

19

By the time Congress

In the words of Taylor versus United

20

States, that was the generic sense in which the

21

term "burglary" was then used in the criminal

22

codes of most states.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That wasn't the

24

position that the government took prior -­

25

prior to Mathis, was it?

I thought that prior

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

to Mathis, the government acknowledged that

2

generic burglary did not include motor vehicles

3

as habitations?

4

MS. ROSS:

I don't think that's quite

5

right, Your Honor.

6

didn't come up as often because, obviously, the

7

government often had two arguments it could

8

make.

9

well as a mobile dwellings argument, but the

Before Mathis, this issue

It would make a divisibility argument as

10

government did, in many of the court of appeals

11

cases going back to the '90s and the early

12

2000s, actually make this argument.

13

Again, it's become more important

14

following Mathis because now the divisibility

15

analysis is harder, and so, in more cases, the

16

outcome is actually turning on whether burglary

17

is capacious enough to include the very types

18

of burglaries that, as we note in the brief, at

19

least 44 states would have counted in 1986.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I have little

21

problem understanding your argument with

22

respect to mobile homes or floating homes.

23

Those are structures that don't have any

24

propulsion -- self-propulsion mechanisms.

25

drive by a mobile home, it's a home on land.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If I
I

Official - Subject to Final Review

don't think of it as a vehicle in any

2

meaningful way.

3

the same.

4

need a vehicle to move it of some sort, a ship.

5

A floating home is essentially

It just floats, but, to move it, you

But RVs, campers, tents, these

6

temporary things, how is some -- someone

7

supposed to know that people are using them to

8

sleep in at a particular moment?

9

MS. ROSS:

Well, Your Honor, to answer

10

sort of your question directly and then just

11

take -- take a step back, I think people often

12

will know that those are being used because

13

those are, in fact, designed or adapted for

14

that purpose.

15

RV generally has -­

16

And so you sort of know that an

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

But

17

how about the -- just a car?

There are plenty

18

of homeless people, I know, in both New York

19

and Washington, because I've seen them, sleep

20

in their cars, but, if I'm a thief and I see a

21

blanket or a pillow in the back of the car, I

22

have no idea, there's no notice that it's being

23

used to sleep in because -- or to sleep in

24

overnight.

25

a trip will throw a pillow and a blanket in the

You know, parents who take a kid on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

back.

I've thrown one in the back if someone

2

else is driving during the day.

3

So what are we supposed to do about

4

the "used" part of this?

5

understand.

6

But how would you, if you're a thief, know that

7

a car is being used for someone to sleep in

8

overnight?

9

"Adapted" I

You might be able to see that.

MS. ROSS:

So, Your Honor, I think

10

there are a number of points sort of in that

11

question.

12

I want to try to get to all of them.
I actually don't think that the

13

vehicle that's simply being used on the trip

14

taking the kid to college is at all at issue in

15

this case.

16

interpretation of either of the statutes that

17

we have before us.

18

That's not a sort of ordinary

The Sims statute that comes closest to

19

make this -- to making this argument, the

20

Arkansas statute applies either to a vehicle

21

that is customarily used for overnight

22

accommodation or one in which a person lives.

23

So somebody sleeping overnight would not fall

24

in there.

25

I also think -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So where any

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

person lives.

2

a car.

3

The homeless person who lives in

MS. ROSS:

Right, Your Honor.

And we

4

don't think that even that interpretation is in

5

front of this Court because that was not raised

6

previously in the brief in opposition.

7

also -­

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
for me.

And it

So define "used"

How is -­

10

MS. ROSS:

So -­

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And define it in a

12

way that a thief is going to know or a burglar

13

is going to know that it's being used as a

14

home.

15

MS. ROSS:

So, Your Honor, the -- I

16

don't think Congress was focusing specifically

17

on whether a burglar would know ahead of time.

18

What Congress was doing was looking at how the

19

states defined "burglary," and that is

20

essentially the -- the central intuition of

21

this Court's decision in Taylor, is that

22

Congress did not itself provide a functional

23

definition of "burglary."

24
25

What it did was it looked at how the
states defined "burglary."

And the states, by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

and large, included vehicles used and adapted

2

for overnight accommodation.

3

Now the specific provision that's at

4

issue in the Sims statute, again, if you think

5

it's properly before the Court, it requires an

6

interpretation of the state law.

7

something that this Court would ordinarily

8

defer to the regional court of appeals on, and

9

-- and the regional court of appeals didn't

That's

10

consider that here.

11

significant that what the statute says is

12

"lives."

13

someone, even in ordinary usage, makes a home.

14

But I think it's

And that is someplace in which

And so I don't think that will

15

necessarily be an ordinary structurally, not at

16

all adapted or changed vehicle.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well -­
You've gone around

19

my question.

20

car that a homeless person is using as their

21

home -- are they encompassed by your definition

22

or by these statutes?

23

Would someone who breaks into a

MS. ROSS:

So, Your Honor, I think

24

they are not encompassed by these statutes.

25

And I think that our definition turns on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

whether most states would, in fact, have

2

included that person.

3

So I don't think that it's encompassed

4

by this statute because, again, I think even

5

the homeless person that you're hypothesizing

6

would change their vehicle in some way that

7

might put a burglar on notice.

8
9

But even if you disagree with me on
that, no state case -- as Respondent Sims

10

readily admits in the brief, no state case has

11

applied it to a vehicle in which someone

12

happens to live.

13

Arkansas.

14

And that's not just true of

Between the Respondents' brief and our

15

reply brief, we've come up with about 12 case

16

-- 12 states that have language that's similar

17

to that, and in none of those states can the

18

government find a case in which these types of

19

statutes were applied to a place where someone

20

lives.

21

And so I think -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, counsel, I'm

22

not sure how that helps you, because you've

23

identified, first of all, that only 12 states

24

are at issue, which seems to me a strike

25

against the government here, as to suggest that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

this was what Congress had in mind in 1984/'86.

2

Second, the -- the statute at least in

3

Arkansas is disjunctive, right?

4

place customarily used to -- to live, which

5

might be your -- line up with the Tennessee

6

statute and suggest some sort of customization

7

or change.

8

that doesn't connote any changes to the vehicle

9

itself at all.

10

It says a -- a

But then it uses "lives in."

And

That could be sleeping in the

back of -- of a car, nothing more.

11

And I wonder, under your

12

interpretation, about this hypothetical, let's

13

say someone breaks into such a car where

14

someone's living, a homeless person or someone

15

crossing the country, to steal a flip phone.

16

That would be burglary, I -- I think you'd say,

17

and the ACCA would kick in and 15 years might

18

-- might follow as a sentence.

19

Compared to the person who tows away

20

the same car without entering it and commits a

21

theft, that would just be a common law theft

22

and -- with no -- no attendant problem, even

23

though maybe an arguably greater harm has

24

occurred.

25

What do you think about that?
MS. ROSS:

Well, Justice Gorsuch, to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

sort of answer your questions in reverse order

2

perhaps, I think that's actually not

3

particularly anomalous because what the -- what

4

the burglar has done in the first case but

5

hasn't done in the second case is opened up

6

exactly the risk of a violent confrontation

7

with which Congress was concerned in -- in

8

enacting a statute that specifically both in

9

1984 and 1986 -­

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, if the car is

11

empty and no one's around, it's -- it's quite

12

unlike a home.

13

going to enter -- what you're going to find

14

when you enter.

15

see.

16

in either of my hypotheticals.

So I modified

17

my hypothetical for you there.

Now what?

18

You don't know what you're

A car, you can look in and

So there's no risk of violent encounter

MS. ROSS:

You have, Your Honor.

But

19

I think at the same time what Congress was

20

doing, again, was not creating its own -- its

21

own definition of "burglary."

22

use the work that the states had already done.

23

And that makes significant sense given that it

24

was enacting a recidivism statute and,

25

therefore, would want to cast its net broadly.

It was trying to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

And this, I think, takes me to Your

2

Honor's first question, which is that,

3

actually, the numbers work in exactly the

4

opposite way, as you suggest.

5

On Respondents' view, there would only

6

be in 1986 -- and the numbers are similar today

7

-- about 12 states in the entire country that

8

would have any burglary offense whatsoever that

9

qualified under the Armed Career Criminal Act.

10

By contrast, on our view -­

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm -- I'm sure he's

12

going to dispute that.

13

numbers game already this morning.

14

we'll be around it again.

15

We've been around the
I'm sure

But how many states in 1986 had

16

anything like a lives-in statute?

17

me an exceedingly small number you've cited to

18

us.

19

MS. ROSS:

It seems to

No, Your Honor, I don't

20

think it's exceedingly small.

21

think, will get me back to your second question

22

if the Court will bear with me.

23

And this, I

So I think there are about 12 statutes

24

that had "lived in" or some kind of similar

25

language, but that's a subset of over 44

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

statutes that would have reached vehicles

2

generally in which people lived that were

3

adapted for overnight accommodation that were

4

customarily used for overnight accommodation.

5

And so I think what you see is that

6

the states all sort of coalesced around this

7

notion of what is a modern-day dwelling.

8

And that makes particular sense

9

because, as I began my presentation this

10

morning, common law or, excuse me, burglary has

11

always focused on dwellings.

12

hardly surprising that a large number of states

13

would have, over time, noticed and taken heed

14

of the fact that people live in many different

15

places and that burglary statutes, therefore,

16

should protect all of those places.

17

And so it is

And so I think what Congress, again,

18

was doing was seeing where the states drew

19

those lines.

20

Court's decision in Taylor.

21

said on no fewer than four occasions that

22

burglary was, in fact, meant in the Armed

23

Career Criminal Act to capture the common sense

24

in which the states were using the term.

25

And we know that from this

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I mean, Taylor

But you are using

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

any car, that is, any car is capable of being

2

lived in, so the burglary statute that you're

3

-- you are envisioning, a statute that took in

4

anything capable of being lived in would

5

include any car?

6

MS. ROSS:

No, Justice Ginsburg, I

7

don't necessarily agree with that.

8

that the Arkansas statute does not actually

9

cover that type of any car that is lived in for

10

I think

the reasons I was giving earlier.

11

One, I think the -- the definition -­

12

the dictionary definition of "lived" would be

13

to occupy as a home, and so we ordinarily would

14

see some type of change to the structure.

15

Two, there is no state case, whether

16

in Arkansas or in any other jurisdiction, that

17

has similar language actually applying the

18

statute to the home in which someone lives

19

without any modification or really to a vehicle

20

at all.

21

And, three, I think if you look at the

22

two parts of the statute, as I believe Justice

23

Gorsuch was noting earlier, one prong says

24

"customarily used," and we think that that's

25

something that is commonly used, perhaps

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

because it's designed for overnight

2

accommodation, and the other is someplace where

3

someone lives.

4

in sort of the -- the adapted in this

5

particular case.

6

And we think that that brings

And so, when you put those two prongs

7

together, you actually get to a place that is

8

quite similar to the Tennessee statute.

9

think that perhaps is why this -­

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And I

It sure sounds to me

11

like you've turned those two prongs into one,

12

made them superfluous.

13

MS. ROSS:

I don't think so, Your

14

Honor, because something that is customarily

15

used would be everyone knows that you can live

16

in that.

17

something of that nature.

18

So it's a mobile home.

It's

Whereas the lived in is just sort of

19

saying, if you actually live in your car, or

20

not your car because no cases, again, actually

21

cover your car, but, if you actually live in

22

another type of structure, we're going to

23

assume that you've adapted it in some way.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
What is "assume"?

I'm -- I'm sorry.

And then what's the meaning

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

of "adapted"?

Is it a structural change of

2

some sort, or is it throwing a pillow and

3

blanket?

Is it putting a mattress in there?

4

What -- what does "adapted" mean?

5

MS. ROSS:

6
7
8
9

So, again, Your Honor, I

would -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And what's

customary to understand that adaptation?
MS. ROSS:

So I think the states have

10

grappled with what -- what is adapted for

11

overnight accommodation under their statutes,

12

and, by and large, this comes up in cases

13

involving campers, hotels, houses under

14

renovation, and -- and the answers are not

15

surprising.

16

Respondent cites three cases for the

17

suggestion that maybe it's difficult to decide

18

whether something is adapted for overnight

19

accommodation.

20

just the types of structures -­

21

And all three of those involve

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

leave it in state hands.

23

federal definition.

24

definition that we give?

25

MS. ROSS:

But we can't just

We're providing a

So what's the federal

You are providing a federal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

definition, Your Honor, but, again, I don't

2

think that when Congress did this it was trying

3

to itself determine these edge cases.

4

instead it was looking to the content -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

dwelling and structure.

7

structure.

8

"structure."

9
10

Well, we said

So now -- building and

Pardon me.

MS. ROSS:

I think

Now we have to define

Yes, Your Honor.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or give some

11

understanding of what the federal meaning of it

12

was.

13

vehicles.

In our cases, we very clearly excluded

14

We said that.
And so now you want us to put a gloss

15

on that.

And I want to know how and what

16

guidance we give on that gloss.

17

MS. ROSS:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

be something permanent to be adapted?

20

MS. ROSS:

Yes, Your Honor.

So -­

So does it have to

So I don't think that there

21

is a -- a clear answer to that question,

22

unfortunately.

23

answer is yes.

24
25

I think the -- the general

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, the problem

really is that, if it's criminal law, shouldn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

we be clear?

2

MS. ROSS:

Well, we should be -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Shouldn't we give

4

notice to people of what the consequences of

5

their actions are, and so don't we have an

6

obligation to be as clear as we can be?

7

MS. ROSS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I think

8

specifically of the examples that you

9

mentioned, the bed and the -- the structural

10

change, those are clearly adaptations that

11

would count.

12
13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

Just a bed,

putting a mattress?

14
15

But even -­

MS. ROSS:

Yes, Your Honor.

I mean, I

-JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about the

17

people who are carrying the mattress from the

18

store to their home?

19

MS. ROSS:

I see that all the time.
Well, no, Your Honor,

20

because that wouldn't be installed in a way

21

that was actually adapted for overnight

22

accommodation.

23
24
25

You would just be -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it has to be

installed in some way?
MS. ROSS:

I mean, you would just be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

transporting your mattress in that case.

2

don't think you've installed your groceries

3

when you bring them home, or things of that

4

nature, or adapted them to that.

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I

Does it matter if

6

it says sometimes, sometimes I sleep in my car,

7

and sometimes I sleep in a home?

8
9

Does it have to be the regular
residence?

Does the car to qualify have to be

10

what you sleep in all the time, or could it be

11

that you have a principal residence someplace

12

else, but many times you sleep in your car?

13

MS. ROSS:

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

14

just to back up again, I think that the vehicle

15

in which you happen to sleep on occasion

16

wouldn't fall in even under the broadest

17

possible interpretation of the Arkansas statute

18

at issue in Sims because you wouldn't live in

19

your car in that instance.

20

it as a home.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

You wouldn't occupy

I'd like to ask you a

22

general question, if you would answer it.

You've read probably Justice Alito's opinion

JUSTICE BREYER:

All right.

Now

3

you've used the words -- I mean, that -- that

4

-- I think there's a point there -- you've used

5

words like common sense.

6

Justice Sotomayor use somewhat similar words.

7

How to -- generic burglary, that's the word,

8

generic burglary.

9

You just heard

I mean, Congress wrote 10 words in

10

this statute.

11

All we have to do is look to state law, and

12

then we'll see whether it's a violent crime or

13

not.

14

thousands of state laws with variations all

15

over the place.

16

It thought it had a simple task.

But Congress forgot that there are

So what this reminds me of, what we're

17

doing, Swift v. Tyson, the brooding

18

omnipresence of the law.

19

to decide what is generic burglary.

20

your opinion do we do?

21

We look up in the sky
So what in

Now Judge Posner said -- and I agreed

with this -- what you should do or the

A second possibility was to say:

2

We'll go back and see if there was violence in

3

this individual case, which is almost

4

impossible because all you see is a rap sheet

5

or something, you know, you don't know, but

6

over time, maybe.

7

And a third possibility is that the

Department of Justice asks Congress to rewrite

the statute, which is exactly what Ms. Bryn

MS. ROSS:

Well, Your Honor, I -- I

certainly understand all of those concerns and

19

I don't think anyone standing here from the

20

Department of Justice would suggest that this

21

is always an easy determination under the

22

categorical approach.

23

I do think in this case it is not

24

particularly difficult, and that is because, as

25

I started out, burglary has always concerned

dwelling.

2

the difficult cases under the categorical

3

approach, it's very clear that when this Court

4

noted in Taylor that Congress had eschewed the

5

common law and gone beyond the common law, that

6

it should have at least captured the types of

7

dwellings that we're talking about today

because, again, 44 states capture them.

So whatever the edge cases, whatever

best I can give you is that 44 states would

have covered this in 1986.

that have a generic burglary statute today.

my friend will quibble with that, but I -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, I'd like you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

to return to Justice Breyer's original

2

question.

3

this case, and I appreciate that, but -- but

4

live with us for a moment in the unease of the

5

more general concern that Justice Breyer

6

raised.

7

I know you want to run straight to

If you survey circuit judges across

8

the country about one gripe they have with this

9

Court's jurisprudence, it may be the ACCA you'd

10

hear a lot.

11

I sometimes hear is why not do an Erie, instead

12

of Swift versus Tyson, and say, well, if the

13

state calls it robbery, if the state calls it

14

burglary, then it's robbery or burglary.

15

And the -- maybe the fourth option

And I'd be curious, and -- and I'm not

16

holding you to any of it, but has the

17

department given any thought to any of these

18

options that Justice Breyer has outlined or

19

that I've just added?

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I add a fifth?

Please.
Because I know there

24

actually is a statute in Congress right now

25

that replaces ACCA with a statute that looks to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

the penalties that have been given.

2

my question is, has the department taken a

3

position on that statute that is pending in

4

Congress currently?

5

MS. ROSS:

So I guess

Your Honor, I apologize,

6

I'm actually not aware of whether the

7

department has taken an official position on

8

that.

9

some sort of general remarks praising that

I know that the Attorney General issued

10

effort, but I don't know if that's gone to the

11

level of a real sort of department position.

12

I do think that we have thought about

13

sort of the other ideas that Justice Breyer and

14

Justice Gorsuch suggest, and among those, I

15

know, Justice Gorsuch, I believe you added

16

anything that the state calls burglary we'll

17

call burglary.

18

I know that this Court at least

19

rejected that in Taylor because, you know, you

20

would have some sort of unfortunate

21

consequences.

22

entitled its burglary statutes as breaking and

23

entering, and they very clearly are burglary,

24

but that just happens to be the nomenclature

25

that Michigan used.

For example, Michigan has always

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

And what this Court said in Taylor and

2

-- and what Congress said was that it really

3

didn't want sort of offenders who exhibited

4

these -- these qualities, had had these

5

dangerous convictions previously, to escape on

6

a technicality.

7
8

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, at least with

respect -­

9

MS. ROSS:

10

And they do worry -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

I mean, you're

11

not exactly on a winning streak here in ACCA

12

cases.

13

(Laughter.)

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

You might have gotten

15

a hint that a majority of the Court really

16

hates ACCA and is picking it apart bit by bit

17

by bit.

18

And at least with respect to the

19

enumerated offenses like burglary, why not

20

depart from this categorical approach and look

21

at what actually happened in the particular

22

case to the extent that you can determine it?

23

If you can't determine that it -- it falls

24

within generic burglary, fine.

25

of cases, you're going to be able to figure

But, in a lot

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

that out very quickly.

2

Otherwise, you're going to be at the

3

mercy of these hypothetical -- these marginal,

4

hypothetical cases that the -- the members of

5

the Court and their law clerks can think of.

6

So the car that is -- you know, has a mattress

7

in the back and -- and, you know, things like

8

that.

9

in the real world, as opposed to these -- these

10

hypotheticals?

11
12

Why not look at what actually happened

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Because didn't this

Court say you can -- couldn't do that?

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, the Court said

14

that, but the Court isn't always right.

15

Sometimes when we make a mess -­

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- which we have done

18

in this -- in my humble opinion, in this area,

19

we have made one royal mess.

20

go back and correct our own mess.

21

MS. ROSS:

Maybe we ought to

Your Honor, again, I -- I

22

think perhaps in some case that would be

23

something that this Court needed to think

24

about.

25

bringing -- for continuing to bring us back to

I really -- I apologize for keep

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

this case, but we haven't asked that the Court

2

reconsider Taylor in this case.

3

that's because we really don't think that we

4

need that in order to prevail here.

And that's -­

5

Taylor, obviously, is where the Court

6

first really embraced the categorical approach

7

with respect to burglary.

8

is quite clear, again, this -- this was really

9

the way in which the states defined burglary by

And in this case, it

10

1984 and 1986.

And in Taylor, this Court made

11

clear that it was helping or -- or illuminating

12

what Congress had done by looking to those same

13

state burglary statutes.

14

And Respondents' suggestion in this

15

case is essentially that this Court take the

16

words that Taylor drew from the state statutes

17

and this Court construe those words

18

significantly more narrowly than the courts of

19

those states actually did, and the statutes of

20

those states actually did, and in the process

21

eliminate more than 20 state burglary statutes

22

from the books, essentially, for ACCA purposes,

23

precisely because those state statutes would

24

cover all types of dwellings.

25

And whatever the edge cases, whatever

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

the hard cases under the Armed Career Criminal

2

Act, we just don't think that that is this

3

case, given what -- what had been on the books

4

in the states at that time.

5

Now I know there's been some

6

discussion this morning about how offenders

7

would have notice of -- of what is in and what

8

is out, but I think we can point you to the

9

same thing, which is that this was the commonly

10

understood -- understanding of burglary in 1984

11

and 1986, and so I don't think that it's too

12

much to assume that if you're convicted of

13

burglary under a typical burglary statute, that

14

that will, in fact, be what Congress and what

15

this Court considers burglary for purposes of

16

the Armed Career Criminal Act.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well -­
Suppose we think

19

about the consequences, the number of years

20

that are added to a person's life by ACCA.

21

Another approach the Court could take is to say

22

because this is such a harsh statute that has

23

such extreme consequences for the individual,

24

we are going to have a clear statement rule for

25

Congress.

If you want to have these kind of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

heavy penalties, you have to be clear.

2

it's ambiguous, we will -- we will not uphold

3

the application of ACCA.

4

And if

The -- starting out with the premise

5

that when the consequences are so severe,

6

Congress has an obligation to be plain.

7

MS. ROSS:

Your Honor, I -- I think

8

Congress was very plain in this statute.

I

9

think, if you took someone in 1984 and 1986 and

10

said burglary, you would think, hmm, burglary

11

isn't generally a federal law or isn't

12

generally a federal crime; I'll look to how the

13

states define burglary.

14

fact, the states defined burglary.

15

And this was how, in

Again, 44 states would include this

16

type of conduct.

17

way that's narrow enough that they would have

18

an ACCA burglary statute on our view.

19

At least 31 include it in a

If you take my friend's position, that

20

number dwindles down to 12.

21

that -- keeping in mind that Congress enacted a

22

very -- a significant penalty for these

23

offenses, I don't think Congress would have

24

expected its work to do so little.

25

And I don't think

And, importantly, it's not as though

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

those 12 would actually be the most severe or

2

the most aggravated burglary offenses in those

3

states.

4

of whether they did or they didn't think about

5

all types of places, whether elaborate or

6

modest, where people live.

7

It's entirely based on this question

So you wouldn't even necessarily be

8

getting the aggravated burglary statutes in

9

that instance.

In fact, if you look at the

10

Tennessee case that we have before us, Stitt,

11

that is an aggravated burglary conviction

12

because it's burglary of a habitation because

13

the court -- or the state very soundly made the

14

determination that when one burgles a

15

habitation, that is a more dangerous and a more

16

serious offense.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Fisher.

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

23

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

24
25

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1
2

We ask the Court to affirm the
judgments below for three reasons.

3

First, this Court's precedent, from

4

Taylor on through to Mathis, make clear that

5

when it comes to the burglary provision of

6

ACCA, buildings and structures are in one

7

category that are inside the statute, vehicles

8

are in another category that are outside the

9

statute, and this case involves quintessential

10
11

vehicles.
Secondly, the "use" prong of the

12

government's definition that it offers to this

13

Court is an independent reason why Arkansas's

14

law goes beyond any generic definition of

15

burglary that would be acceptable.

16

And, third, if necessary, we would ask

17

this Court to apply the Sixth Amendment rule

18

that Justice Thomas announced in Apprendi and

19

himself laid out in Mathis and Shepard, that

20

ACCA itself violates the Sixth Amendment

21

because it transgresses the jury trial right.

22

Now -­

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I stop you on your

24

first point, Mr. Fisher?

So the Court has

25

indeed said many times that vehicles fall

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

outside the generic definition of "burglary."

2

But I think that when the Court said that, what

3

it really meant was this is a way to say if -­

4

if the -- if a statute covers basic car theft,

5

it's outside ACCA.

6

burglary offense.

7

That's not the typical

And the Court was not thinking about

8

mobile homes or RVs.

It just didn't have that

9

in its head when it made those statements.

So

10

those statements really don't have much to do

11

with the question in this case.

12

MR. FISHER:

I think the -- the

13

closest the Court did come to actually dealing

14

with that question was in Mathis.

15

the Iowa statute there didn't simply cover all

16

vehicles; it covered vehicles that were adapted

17

for an over -- overnight accommodation or use

18

in a couple of other ways.

19

Remember,

And the government in its brief said

20

the mere fact that the statute covers vehicles

21

is enough to put it outside of ACCA.

22

Court said the same thing four times in its

23

opinion.

And the

24

And I'd hasten to add -- and I think

25

this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

in the first part of the argument about the

2

government's position in Mathis -- the

3

government on page 42 in Mathis said if you

4

adopt the divisibility rule being urged by the

5

other side, you're going to leave many state

6

statutes outside of burglary.

7

12, the government cited many state statutes

8

that it now is back here claiming actually do

9

fall within burglary, even though the

And in Footnote

10

government's representation to this Court in

11

Mathis is that they would fall outside.

12

So I -- I understand -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I don't think -- I

14

don't think Mathis really is -- is at odds with

15

what I was saying.

16

agreed that this covered vehicles, broadly

17

speaking.

18

the other party conceded it.

19

of the opinions viewed it that way.

20

Everybody in that case

The government conceded it, the -­
All -- all -- all

And so nobody really ever addressed

21

the question of, are there different kinds of

22

vehicles in the world?

23

there mobile homes?

24
25

MR. FISHER:

Are there cars and are

Yeah.

So -- so I

understand, Justice Kagan, you haven't had this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

precise type of object in front of you.

But I

2

think the Court's opinions are still

3

illuminating because the Court does say there's

4

vehicles on the one hand and structures and

5

buildings on the other.

6

And so the project here is which

7

category do things like sleeper vans or a

8

sailboat tied up at harbor that has a sleeping

9

quarters underneath fit into.

10

And so, just as the Court has held in

11

the Fourth Amendment context of California

12

versus Carney, just as the HUD regulations that

13

we cite at page 11 of our brief lay out, just

14

as the state law like Tennessee lays out, just

15

like local law, like local zoning law we cite

16

on the same page of our brief, they all

17

distinguish between floating homes and mobile

18

homes, which are designed to be stationary on

19

the one hand, and put those in the structure

20

category, or a -- or a dwelling or a residence

21

category.

22

On the other hand, there are things

23

like recreational vehicles, sleeper vans, and

24

boats that have sleeping quarters that have

25

always been in the vehicle category, and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

reason why is because the principal purpose of

2

those objects is transportation.

3

They can be used incidentally for

4

overnight accommodation and they are

5

occasionally used, but I want to stress to the

6

Court it's only occasional.

7

some displeasure with the categorical approach

8

in the first part of the case, and I'm happy to

9

engage in that, but just to take the law as it

And I know I heard

10

stands, and as the government is not asking you

11

to change it, the -- the hypothetical the

12

government has to answer for is the vacant

13

sleeper van or boat tied up at harbor that is

14

used only a few days a year and shows no

15

outward signs of current habitation.

16

That's the hypothetical that both

17

Tennessee and Arkansas sweep in.

18

later to the specific provision of Arkansas

19

law, the lives-in provision, which is even

20

broader.

21

government has to answer.

22

I'll turn

But that's the hypothetical the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Justice Kagan -­
But there are a lot of

23

-- there are a lot of vacation homes that are

24

occupied for only a short period of time and

25

a -- somebody contemplating a burglary can look

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

at them and determine pretty easily that place

2

is not occupied at the -- at the present time.

3

But what about, say you have a house,

4

and then next to it you have a self-propelled

5

vehicle that is designed or adapted for the

6

overnight accommodation of persons and is

7

actually occupied at the time of the initial

8

entry by the defendant.

9

Is there any reason why the -- the

10

burglary of the house should be treated

11

differently from the burglary of this vehicle?

12

Isn't the risk exactly the same?

13

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Alito, I'm

14

going to answer that question, but just allow

15

me to preface it.

16

I don't have -- I don't have to win

17

that hypothetical because I -- the hypothetical

18

the government has to win is the person not

19

being in and it not being near a house.

20

to answer your question directly, I would still

21

say -­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

But,

Well, why don't you

23

have to win that?

That's the Arkansas statute.

24

What I read you is exactly what the Arkansas

25

statute says.

does not require it -- it does require the

7

person to be there, yes, Justice Alito.

But it does not require

10

it to be sitting right by a house.

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it could

saying, this is the contrast, why would -- why

14

is one you would concede burglary and the

16

possible reason why the law should treat those

17

two situations differently.

18

MR. FISHER:

I don't see any

I think because the

19

criminal law, we've heard a lot about notice

20

this morning, and a core concept of criminal

21

law is providing fair notice.

22

And so, for the same reason that a

23

vacation home is inside burglary because it is

24

a home, it is a dwelling, and so you would

25

expect it to be occupied as a residence, even

Heritage Reporting Corporation

if it happens to be somebody's second home,

separate times of breaking into an RV and look

12

at that, those sources, you would be on some

13

notice that you shouldn't be possessing a

14

firearm under federal law.

15

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice -- Justice

16

Kavanaugh, there are many, many pieces of

17

Taylor.

18

my friend is focused on.

19

So there is the state law piece that

But Taylor also says on the very same

20

page that Congress in 1986 intended the

21

practical identical definition of "burglary" as

22

in the '84 Act.

23

only buildings.

24
25

Remember, the '84 Act covered

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But Taylor -­

Taylor does not do that, though, when it says

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

other -- or other structures.

2

Taylor departs from the '84 statute in what it

3

describes there, don't you agree, when it says

4

"or other structures"?

5

MR. FISHER:

Quite clearly,

I think it departs from

6

the '84, but that's why -- that's why the court

7

--

8
9
10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Because the '84

Act only says building.
MR. FISHER:

That's right.

I think

11

that's why the court said practically identical

12

and not identical.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And one of the -­

14

I'm sorry to interrupt.

15

it departed, as I read the opinion, which is

16

quite thorough, is it did a full excavation of

17

the Model Penal Code, of the treatises, of the

18

state statutes, and said the '84 definition

19

does not reflect common understanding, as Judge

20

Sutton described in detail in his opinion, of

21

the common understanding at the time of what

22

burglary entailed.

23

MR. FISHER:

And one of the reasons

Right.

The Court did

24

look to state law in Taylor, but, as I said, it

25

also looked to legislative intent and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1
2

drafting history and the like.
And I think Taylor was correct insofar

3

as it went at that time that you still would

4

have covered a majority of the states, even if

5

Taylor covered vehicles adapted for overnight

6

accommodation.

7

The switch happened in Mathis.

That's when the government came to the

8

Court and said, if you have an aggressive

9

divisibility jurisprudence, that's going to

10

leave aside many state laws because of

11

divisibility reasons.

12

state law concern is in Mathis.

13

bridge the Court has already crossed and that

14

the government doesn't ask the Court to -- to

15

-- to revisit.

16

So the answer to the
And that's the

If we're talking about Congressional

17

intent, I think there's one other important

18

thing to put on the table in the text of the

19

law, and that's the residual clause.

20

the Court obviously has invalidated that

21

clause, but we think the text is relevant in

22

terms of Congressional intent.

23

I know

And the text of that clause, remember,

24

reads as follows.

After the enumerated crimes,

25

it says any other crime that "otherwise

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

involves" -- I'm sorry, I'm reading at page

2

10-A of the government's appendix -- "that

3

otherwise involves conduct that presents a

4

serious potential risk of physical injury."

5

And so the word "otherwise" tells us

6

that when Congress defined "burglary" -- in

7

fact, it didn't define it -- but when Congress

8

used the word "burglary," it must have assumed

9

that the version of burglary it had in mind

10

"involved conduct that presents a serious

11

potential risk of physical injury."

12

Now, if you look at the NAFD amicus

13

brief -- and this is responsive also to Justice

14

Breyer's questions about statistics -- there

15

actually have been quite a lot of studies

16

conducted about burglary law, and what they

17

find is that when there's a burglary of a home

18

or somebody's residence, there is a real

19

possibility that you could have a violent

20

confrontation or physical injury, something in

21

the range of 2 to 7 percent of the time.

22

By contrast, when it's burglary of a

23

non-residential structure, the percentage goes

24

down to .17 percent, which translates to one

25

out of every 700 crimes that involve what a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

state would expansively call burglary of a

2

non-residential structure.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

4

this case belong in?

5

MR. FISHER:

6

So this case belongs in

the latter.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. FISHER:

9
10
11

Which category does

Why?

Because we're talking

about things that are not primary residences.
They're not -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

But they're -- I

12

mean, they're residences, they're inhabited by

13

people, and so I don't know why it would be a

14

lower statistic if it's, say, a car or a

15

trailer or -- or some kind of motorized vehicle

16

that a person uses as his home.

17

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think, Justice

18

Breyer, the typical usage of something like a

19

sleeper van or recreational vehicle is not as a

20

residence.

21

have a second vehicle that they use for trips

22

and weekends and vacations and the like.

23

A person has a home, and then they

And so, if you ask somebody that has a

24

house and a sleeper van, where is your

25

residence, they would point to their house, not

the sleeper van.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:
what are you -­

MR. FISHER:

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

10

What are you -­

what are you basing that assertion on?

8
9

And I think that's the

way the statistics work.

6
7

What are you -­

MR. FISHER:

I'm just basing it on a

common sense understanding of the word
"residence," Justice Kavanaugh.

11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Are these

12

assertions about RVs you're -­

13

MR. FISHER:

14

And I think -­

The customary usage

assertion?

15

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

16

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

Well, we -- we do cite -­

17

we cite a statistic in our brief from a -- from

18

a trade association, Justice Kavanaugh, if you

19

want to look at that as a pretty thorough study

20

done out of the University of Michigan, and

21

what they found is that the typical owner of a

22

recreational vehicle uses it only 19 nights a

23

year.

24
25

That's 5 percent of the time.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Your position, Mr.

Fisher, is that mobile homes are included, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

RVs are excluded, is that correct?

2

MR. FISHER:

I think -- I think it's

3

probably correct as to mobile homes.

4

at issue in front of the Court.

5

that would be -­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It's not

But I think

Yeah, but that's -­

7

that's what I understood you to be saying in

8

your brief.

9

MR. FISHER:

10
11

Yeah.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.

Does any state make

that distinction in its law?

12

MR. FISHER:

13

just to start with Tennessee.

14

of the Tennessee law on page 14-A has -- covers

15

structures, which it includes in the definition

16

of structure a mobile home.

17

Well, Tennessee does,
Subsection (a)

Subsection (b) talks about vehicles.

18

And vehicles is the subsection in front of the

19

Court, and so you don't have to look any

20

further than the government's appendix in this

21

case.

22

Illinois, the Smith case, which the government

23

itself cites and, in fact, asks this Court to

24

follow, distinguishes between motor homes on

25

the one hand and things that are -- that are

And you find it in other state laws too.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

less -- less commonly used for overnight

2

accommodation on the other.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could you give your

4

view of where, if -- if we accepted your

5

position, what that would mean in terms of how

6

many states' laws qualified?

7

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

And I want to -- I

8

think I can give you a thorough typology, if

9

you let me, which is we -- we do agree with the

10

government that -- that only about 12 states

11

would be within the definition if you were to

12

hold both Tennessee and Arkansas law fall

13

outside of it.

14

bring in -- would bring in many states.

So the "adapted" clause would

15

But, on the other hand, the government

16

hasn't told you that, on the back end, you have

17

about 20 other states that are broad even under

18

the government's -- overbroad even under the

19

government's definition.

20

So what this -- what this case boils

21

down to, Justice Kagan, is a delta between the

22

parties of something about between 15 and 19

23

state -- states.

24

have states like Tennessee -­

25

And even in those states, you

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm sorry, you said

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

that in a way that -­

2

MR. FISHER:

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

4

I'm sorry.

what -- what you're fighting about -­

5

MR. FISHER:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7
8
9
10
11
12

-- that the delta,

Yes.
-- is in the high

teens?
MR. FISHER:

Yes, that's right.

And

even -- and even among that group of states -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:
significant.

I mean, that's

That's a lot.

MR. FISHER:

I -- I don't dispute that

13

that's somewhat significant.

Even among those

14

states, though, there are many states like

15

Tennessee that would have a separate provision

16

that it's divisible, that it would still

17

qualify as -- as burglary.

18

think, less than the high teens.

So it's even, I

19

And I understand that the government

20

keeps harping on the number of states because

21

that is certainly the -- the strongest version

22

of their argument.

23

case about first principles and not about stare

24

decisis where the Court had already said that

25

vehicles are out, we think there's three

But even if this were a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

countervailing forces that -- that, as a matter

2

of first principles, should leave the kind of

3

vehicles we have at issue here out.

4

First, we have the broader context of

5

the law that I've described, which is the 1984

6

Act and the -- and this Court's understanding

7

that Congress didn't intend to significantly

8

expand upon the definition there, as well as

9

the residual clause and what that tells you

10

about Congressional intent, trying to get only

11

those burglaries that had a significant risk of

12

violent acts or physical injury.

13

Secondly, we have the purpose of ACCA,

14

which is laid out at great length in the Taylor

15

opinion, where, again, the Court said, in much

16

the same words as the residual clause, what

17

Congress was worried about were particular

18

crimes where there's a risk of -- inherent risk

19

of physical injury and not only the inherent

20

risk but a awareness on the fact of the

21

perpetrator that that risk was present.

22

this -- this speaks to some of the conversation

23

earlier.

24
25

And

And then, thirdly, we haven't yet
talked about administrability.

And I think the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

Court got a preview into the difficulty in

2

terms of administrability when you asked Ms.

3

Ross about what the word "adapted" means.

4

Now our definition, Justice Kagan -­

5

this brings me back to the conversation we just

6

had -- is well-grounded in federal, state, and

7

local law.

8

throughout every level of law that separates

9

stationary structures that can be moved, like a

10

mobile home or a floating home on the one hand,

11

and things that are essentially vehicles on the

12

other.

13

There's a definition that runs

The "adapted" definition that the

14

government gives you they readily admit is not

15

easily defined.

16

just to be candid, don't know whether a

17

physical adaptation is required.

18

in the back of a station wagon enough?

19

the government suggests at page 18 of its

20

brief, simply hanging a T-shirt in the window

21

like a curtain to block a light enough?

22

And I still, as I stand here,

Is a mattress
Is, as

Different states are going to answer

23

that question differently.

And not only does

24

the Stitt brief point out a couple of examples,

25

but the NACDL brief points out examples at

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

pages 13 to 15 of its brief.

2

So "adapted" is going to be a very,

3

very difficult line to draw, and I don't know

4

how -- how many cases the Court wants to have

5

come back to it on that.

6

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But isn't that

7

what the Model Penal Code had and some states

8

already have?

9

something that would be created now.

10

In other words, this is not

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Kavanaugh,

11

it's true that many states have statutory

12

language that says adapted for overnight

13

accommodation.

14

different states will interpret that

15

differently, which is my -- why Ms. Ross

16

couldn't give you -­

17

But what I'm telling you is

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

I understand, but

18

that's always going to be the case that there

19

will be some slight differences, right?

20

mean -­

21

MR. FISHER:

That may be true.

I

But I

22

think, when you don't have a firm grounding

23

throughout other areas of law like our rule

24

does, you're more likely to have variation in

25

problems.

I think that's what I would tell

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1
2

you.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And you don't

3

think "adapted" has a firm grounding, even

4

though it's been around in most state statutes

5

for -- or many state statutes?

6

MR. FISHER:

Well, I don't see a

7

definition in the government's brief, and I

8

haven't seen a definition anywhere else.

9

so I'm certainly not aware of one.

10

So -­

I would ask you also, in -- as you

11

look sort of as a matter of first principles,

12

if you have any doubt as to how to resolve this

13

case, we think this is a case that really cries

14

out for the rule of lenity.

15

Another important aspect of notice, of

16

course, is for defendants to have fair

17

understanding of what conduct would qualify for

18

a given sentencing enhancement.

19

And, if nothing else, the fact that

20

this Court has said on so many occasions that

21

vehicles are out, without any qualifications,

22

without any reservations, and that structures

23

and buildings are in, would have told the

24

ordinary person that -- that vehicles, even

25

like sleeper vans, recreational vehicles, were

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

outside of the definition of generic burglary.

2

If I may, I'd like to spend a few

3

minutes on the specific provision of Arkansas

4

law that was also spoke -- talked about at the

5

beginning of the argument.

6

As I understand the government's

7

position, it's not disputing that an ordinary

8

car would be outside the locational element of

9

burglary.

10

Now the first thing the government

11

said was they didn't think that was before the

12

Court.

13

the case, given that it's within the question

14

presented.

15

But I just don't see how that could be

The question presented that the

16

government itself drafted says "adapted or

17

used."

18

different than "adapted."

19

quite obviously covers things like the Arkansas

20

statute, which is an ordinary vehicle in which

21

somebody lives.

22

And so "used" has to mean something
And we think it

And the government's only answer to

23

that statutory language is, well, every single

24

time somebody lives in a car, it will, in fact,

25

be adapted.

Now Justice Gorsuch already

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

pointed out one problem with that, which is

2

surplusage.

3

wouldn't need anything other than an "adapted"

4

clause.

5

If that were the case, you

JUSTICE ALITO:

But we're talking

6

about a state statute that could well be

7

interpreted in lots of different ways by the

8

state courts.

9

definitive interpretation of the Arkansas

10

You want us to provide a -- a

statute here?

11

MR. FISHER:

I think if it were

12

ambiguous, Justice Alito, that might be

13

something you wouldn't want to do.

14

the plain language so obviously covers an

15

ordinary car, we don't think there's any reason

16

to flinch from that.

17

But, when

In Mellouli -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, this was -­

18

this was raised pretty late in the day, this

19

argument about the Arkansas statute and "living

20

in."

21

in Duenas, why don't we do exactly what Justice

22

Alito is suggesting and just remand it and let

23

-- let the lower courts figure it out?

24

they can certify it to the Arkansas Supreme

25

Court and figure this out.

And given that -- and given our decision

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Maybe

Official - Subject to Final Review
54

MR. FISHER:

So for -- so for two

2

reasons, one procedural and one substantive,

3

Justice Gorsuch.

4

squarely within the government's question

5

presented.

6

is asking the Court to adopt.

header in the argument section to its rule says

vehicles that are adapted or used for overnight

9

accommodation.

The procedural reason is it's

It's within the rule the government

10

So I don't know how you -­

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

12

I'll spot you all of

that.

13

MR. FISHER:

Okay.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. FISHER:

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm -- I'm with you.

So -­
But it -- the -- the

18

Eighth Circuit didn't have a chance to consider

19

this particular argument about living in.

20

it's a -- it's a -- it's a nifty little

21

argument, but maybe we'd benefit from being a

22

court of review rather than first view on it.

23

MR. FISHER:

And

Well, I'd encourage the

24

Court to do exactly -- this is my substantive

25

answer -- to do exactly what it did in Mellouli

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

when the -- we had a controlled substances law

2

in front of you and the question was whether

3

that state law from Kansas was overbroad into

4

the categorical approach.

5

argued in its brief that because there were no

6

state court decisions actually applying that

7

state law in the broader way, that the Court

8

shouldn't accept that under Duenas-Alvarez.

9

But the Court -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

The government

The obvious -- I

11

mean, the obvious interpretation the other way

12

is that what they mean by "used" is used

13

regularly or used more than once or used in

14

some other way.

15

can't believe that they'd mean used once -­

And we don't know -- I mean, I

16

MR. FISHER:

No -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and the person

18

left his briefcase or something in the car.

19

They can't mean that.

20

MR. FISHER:

No, I agree it doesn't

21

mean that, Justice Breyer.

22

means is what Justice Sotomayor was describing

23

earlier, which is somebody who uses the car as

24

their home and sleeps in the car every night.

25

What we say it

And -- and this is the empirical

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

answer to the government's assertion, which is

2

just it is empirically untrue that every time

3

somebody sleeps in a car, they will adapt it

4

for that overnight accommodation.

5

quite to the contrary, many people would be

6

embarrassed to be using their car as a home.

7

Or they would be concealing that fact because

8

they would be looking to evade local zoning

9

laws that would prohibit sleeping overnight in

10

In fact,

parking lots or the like.

11

So we cite in our -- in our red brief,

12

Justice Breyer, an article from The New York

13

Times in a footnote of a whole collection of

14

studies and articles that explain this

15

phenomenon.

16

empirical matter, that a car in which somebody

17

lives will be necessarily adapted for overnight

18

use.

19

And it is just not true, as an

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if you were

20

representing a defendant before the Arkansas

21

Supreme Court and the person had been convicted

22

under this statute, a person lived in the car

23

but every morning cleaned up the car so there

24

was no way anybody could tell that anybody had

25

been living there, wouldn't -- would you rule

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

out the possibility of arguing to the Arkansas

2

Supreme Court that there might -- that maybe

3

there should be some additional requirements

4

read into this provision?

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, Justice Alito, if I

6

were appointed to that case, I might make that

7

argument, but I think I would have a pretty

8

lousy argument, and the reason why is because

9

the plain text of the law would be directly

10
11

against my argument.
Remember, the -- there's already -­

12

there's a separate prong of Arkansas law that

13

covers customary usage, and I think I heard Ms.

14

Ross say that covers the kinds of vehicles that

15

are designed for that purpose or physically

16

adapted to that purpose.

17

So the only thing the other clause can

18

mean under standard tools of statutory

19

construction is the other -- is some other kind

20

of car, in which somebody lives.

21

think, even if somebody were to make that

22

argument to the Arkansas Supreme Court, we cite

23

in our brief cases from the State of Arkansas

24

that says we follow ordinary statutory

25

construction principles.

And so I

And it would just be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1
2

a flat loser of an argument.
And even if the plain text arguments

3

weren't enough, we outline in our red brief in

4

the Sims case the numerous other reasons why

5

the plain language of the state statute ought

6

to control for categorical approach purposes,

7

and those -- and those are two general

8

categories:

9

predictability, and fairness that undergird the

first, the efficiency,

10

categorical approach, and, secondly, the Sixth

11

Amendment concerns that undergird the

12

categorical approach, all of which coalesce to

13

amount to if the state law is clear on its face

14

that it's broader than the federal counterpart

15

that -- that the prior conviction under the

16

state law simply can't be a qualifying offense.

17

And so we think that's enough to decide the

18

case on the Arkansas side.

19

There were some questions earlier

20

about how the Court should think about the

21

categorical approach more generally, and so let

22

me say a couple words about that because I do

23

think it is a fair observation from the Court

24

that part of what's dwindling down the number

25

of states covered by the government's approach

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

in -- in our case is the nature of the

2

categorical approach.

3

Now the Court had fair notice of that.

4

The government told you this in Mathis, and it

5

told you even in Taylor that if you go down

6

these roads, you're going to start to dwindle

7

the number of states.

8
9

And the Court, I think, had good
reasons to do that because, when you turn to

10

the categorical approach, it's not just about

11

Congressional intent, it's about these

12

predictability, fairness, and Sixth Amendment

13

constitutional concerns that have to be in

14

play.

15

Congressional intent.

16

workability.

17

constitutional jurisprudence.

18

So it's not purely a question of
It's also a question of

But -- as workability and

But -- but regardless of how different

19

members of the Court think about those

20

undergirding principles, there is, in fact, as

21

Justice Kagan mentioned, there's a -- there's a

22

bill before Congress right now that would adopt

23

a totally different approach.

24

something Attorney General Sessions spoke about

25

in August.

And this is

And so it is very much on the table

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

in Congress right now to take a different

2

approach.

3

And I'd return the Court, if I may, to

4

Taylor.

5

pending at the time of that decision, and the

6

Court, for whatever reason, went ahead and

7

issued its opinion in Taylor and has sort of

8

owned this jurisprudence ever since.

9

In Taylor, there was actually a bill

And one thing that you might think

10

about here is there's a bill pending in

11

Congress right now.

12

for the Court to continue down its -- its prior

13

precedent.

14

reasons for what you've done.

15

We think the safer path is

They have good -- you have good

I understand some of you are

16

frustrated with it.

And maybe Congress is

17

frustrated with it.

But the best thing the

18

Court, I think, can do is follow its own

19

jurisprudence in this case, which is -- which

20

means two things:

21

One is apply the categorical approach

22

as you've outlined it, all the way up through

23

Mathis, and even apply it as to burglary, as

24

you've put structures and buildings on the one

25

hand and vehicles on the other.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

And if Congress is dissatisfied with

2

the outcome, it's obviously fully able to pass

3

the law that's pending, and the department,

4

even if it hasn't taken a firm position, can

5

take a position and get something done.

6

But we think if the Court goes out of

7

its way again to do something more extravagant

8

in these cases, you're going to potentially own

9

this jurisprudence a lot longer.

10
11

And that's

what -- really what's happening here.
The reason these cases are in front of

12

you, you may know this already, but the reason

13

these cases are in front of you are because

14

after the invalidation of the residual clause

15

the government is going around and making a

16

bunch of arguments that it didn't make before,

17

trying to get in various prior state

18

convictions that it wasn't arguing for under

19

the enumerated clauses or under the use of

20

force clauses.

21

explosion of ACCA cases.

22

That's why you have this new

And so I think the better thing is for

23

the Court to follow its own cases, its own

24

precedent, leave it to Congress to adjust if it

25

wants, but not feel like it has to solve every

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

single problem as it arises.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Fisher, if we

3

accept the government's "adapted," and I

4

understand all its problems, would the

5

Tennessee statute survive?

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

If you -­
And if it's not,

why not?

9

MR. FISHER:

If you accept the

10

government's -- if you accept the government's

11

definition of "adapted," then the Tennessee

12

statute would -- would fall within it, but it

13

would be also -- there -- there would be -- so,

14

yeah, I think the answer to that is yes, if you

15

accept the government's argument on "adapted,"

16

then Tennessee is within it.

17

But we ask, for all the reasons I've

18

asked before, not to accept the government's

19

argument to "adapted."

20

The only thing the government has to

21

say for itself, Justice Sotomayor, and I may be

22

repeating myself here, is the state-by-state

23

count.

24

the flow of this Court's jurisprudence and the

25

other things in Taylor, things like adhering to

We think the state count is answered by

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

the '84 Congressional intent, adhering to the

2

most important thing perhaps, which is just

3

sweeping in violent offenders.

4

Mr. Chief Justice, you talked about

5

people using guns.

You know, that would be the

6

quintessential case.

7

it a little bit more broadly, a risk of

8

physical injury, but for all the reasons I've

9

argued and we've shown in our briefs, the outer

Of course, Congress drew

10

limits of the Tennessee law, even on its own

11

terms, covers these kinds of cases that, as I

12

said to Justice Breyer earlier, are a

13

one-in-700 chance of physical injury.

14

And in those kinds of cases, we don't

15

think Congress would have expected a state law

16

to -- to be swept up into ACCA.

17

hasten to add that I think this is also

18

responsive, Justice Breyer, you asked about how

19

these cases are charged.

And I would

20

When there are the kinds of

21

altercations that Justice Alito, for example,

22

was -- was hypothesizing, somebody is in inside

23

and there is a violent altercation, those cases

24

aren't charged as burglary.

25

things like carjacking, robbery, assault.

They're charged as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

So the burglary convictions, and this

2

is what the Sentencing Commission found when it

3

backed burglary out of even the crime of

4

violence provisions in the Sentencing

5

Guidelines, it found that when burglary is

6

charged, it's in the cases where nothing

7

happened but the entry.

8
9

And so that may well still satisfy the
categorical definition of burglary under ACCA,

10

the residential entry, because of the awareness

11

and because of the inherent risk, but once you

12

go beyond primary residences and talk about

13

things that are hardly ever occupied and that

14

people are going to target specifically because

15

they're hardly ever occupied, walking down to

16

the -- to the -- to the marina with a sleepy

17

sailboat on the dock and rummaging through the

18

contents, those are the kinds of things that

19

Congress, I don't think, would have expected to

20

be swept up and any sensible definition of ACCA

21

wouldn't trigger the harsh consequences that

22

follow.

23
24
25

If there are no more questions, I'll
submit the case.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ERICA ROSS

4

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONER

5
6
7

MS. ROSS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I just want to make a few points.

8

first is that Justice Gorsuch suggested that

9

perhaps my friend on the other side would

10

quibble with our numbers with respect to how

11

many states would have ACCA burglary and how

12

many wouldn't under our view and under

13

Respondents' view.

14

The

And my friend has not actually

15

quibbled with those numbers.

16

at most, we're looking at 12 states with ACCA

17

burglary under his view.

18

He agrees that,

And I think that that is itself, if

19

not dispositive, very close to it because,

20

again, we -- we don't think that's a statute

21

that Congress would have passed.

22

Now my friend has a couple of reasons

23

why Congress might have done that.

He says,

24

well, really the delta's only 20 or so cases -­

25

or 20 or so states, but those 20 states make

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

the difference between the definition of ACCA

2

burglary, satisfying what this Court said four

3

times over in Taylor, that it was trying to get

4

at the way that the states used the term

5

"burglary," the majority of states.

6

that with respect to the 1984 statute, with

7

respect to the 1986 statute, as a reason for

8

rejecting the common law definition, and when

9

it introduced the categorical approach and said

10

that a few state statutes might be broader than

11

the definition that it was adopting.

12
13

It said

So those 20 state statutes, I think,
really cannot be underestimated here.

14

The other reason that my friend gave

15

for why the numbers are so low is that Mathis

16

changed everything, but Mathis didn't change

17

everything.

18

Mathis interpreted this -- the ACCA as it

19

always stood.

20

Congress when it enacted the statute in the

21

first instance would have expected about 12

22

state laws to come in as burglary.

23

As Mathis itself would explain,

And so I don't think that

Another thing that my friend mentioned

24

was the residual clause.

Again, I don't think

25

that when Congress enacted a statute with the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

word "burglary" and then with the residual

2

clause, which we know was an attempt to expand

3

the scope of the statute to reach other crimes,

4

that it, in fact, would have meant for most

5

burglary statutes or a substantial number of

6

burglary statutes to come in through the

7

residual clause while narrowing the point or

8

the -- the word "burglary" to essential

9

obsolescence.

10

So, given the way that the state

11

statutes play out here, we think that our

12

reading is the one that is consistent with what

13

Congress was -- was trying to do and with

14

Taylor itself.

15

Now, speaking in terms of Taylor, my

16

friend mentioned that Taylor said that the

17

definition that it was taking on was

18

practically identical to the 1984 definition

19

and that that definition only included

20

buildings.

21

What I think -- I apologize, I don't

22

remember exactly who said it -- someone had

23

mentioned, one of the Justices had mentioned

24

that, in fact, the practical difference may

25

make up for the fact -- I believe it was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

Justice Kavanaugh -- that really the difference

2

between buildings and structures.

3

might well be true.

4

And that

I also think that Taylor itself was

5

looking at a definition of "building."

6

Congress in 1984 was looking at a definition of

7

"building" that had taken on its own very broad

8

meaning in burglary law.

9

And

If you look at the appendix to our

10

brief in this case, most, if not all, of the

11

states that actually defined "building" did so

12

in terms of vehicles, other structures, et

13

cetera.

14

So they had a very broad definition

15

that might not make sense in ordinary English

16

but was what state burglary statutes used.

17

so, when this Court comes along in Taylor and

18

says building or structure, it's really just

19

explicating that.

20

And

Another way to look at this is through

21

the LaFave treatise that we obviously rely on

22

in the briefs, which similarly makes clear that

23

those -- that both "building" and "structure"

24

were often broadly construed.

25

Another point that I just wanted to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

clear up with respect to the government's

2

position in Mathis.

3

that the government said that all of the

4

statutes that it noted would, in fact, be out

5

if Mathis came out the way it did.

6

would raise some questions.

7

I don't think it is true

It said it

And many of those statutes, in fact,

8

are broader than the statutes that we're

9

talking about here today.

10

In closing, we heard a lot about

11

numbers this morning both on our side and -­

12

and from my friend.

13

-- there are two things, really, at the core at

14

this case that can't be denied:

15

I think the thing that we

One is that burglary has always

16

protected the core of dwellings.

17

second is that, on Respondents' view, ACCA

18

burglary takes a step back from that and

19

includes far fewer dwellings, eliminates the

20

majority of state statutes precisely because

21

they cover exactly what courts for centuries

22

have thought of as the core of burglary.

23

And the

We don't think that's what Congress

24

intended.

We don't think that's what this

25

Court intended in Taylor.

And we would,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
70
1

therefore, ask that the decisions below be

2

reversed.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sorry, Ms. Ross.

Do

4

you agree that if a statute covers just regular

5

cars, that that falls outside?

6
7

MS. ROSS:

nobody's living there?

8
9

Regular cars meaning no -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:
Nobody's doing that.

10

MS. ROSS:

Nobody's living there.

You're just driving it.
Yes, Your Honor, I think it

11

would be difficult in light of this Court's

12

cases, even though actually a large number of

13

states covered those, I think it would be very

14

difficult in light of Mathis and -- and

15

Duenas-Alvarez and all the other cases in which

16

this Court said -­

17
18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

accepting that those are out?

19
20
21

So -- so you're

MS. ROSS:

Yes, Your Honor, you're

right.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

And how about the -­

22

the ones that say vehicles that are used for

23

business activities, commercial activities, are

24

those in or out?

25

MS. ROSS:

So, Your Honor, we haven't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

taken a position on that.

2

not raised in these cases.

3

the considered view of the Justice Department

4

at this point.

5

those statutes at this point.

6

In this Court, it's
That is not sort of

questions, we'd ask that you reverse in both

cases.
