CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

argument this morning in Case 17-1091, Timbs

5

versus Indiana.

6

Mr. Hottot.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WESLEY P. HOTTOT

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. HOTTOT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

The freedom from excessive fines

12

applies to the states because it is deeply

13

rooted in our nation's history and traditions

14

and fundamental to our scheme of ordered

15

liberty.

16

The State of Indiana appears not to

17

dispute that straightforward answer to the

18

actual question presented.

19

reason.

20

easily warrants incorporation alongside the

21

Eighth Amendment's other protections.

22

Court has said just that five times over the

23

last 30 years.

24
25

And for good

The freedom from excessive fines

This

Without addressing the incorporation
question directly, the State asked whether the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

clause applies to the states the same way that

2

it applies to the federal government.

3

years of incorporation precedent holds that

4

incorporated Bill of Rights protections apply

5

to the states the exact same way that they

6

apply to the federal government.

7

But 50

There's no reason to adopt the

8

so-called two-track approach at this late stage

9

of the incorporation doctrine, especially -­

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is that so of all

11

incorporations?

What about the non-unanimous

12

jury in -- in criminal cases?

13

MR. HOTTOT:

Justice Ginsburg, as the

14

Court recognized in McDonald, the non-unanimous

15

jury in criminal cases is an anomalous decision

16

that results from a one-justice concurrence in

17

the Apodaca case, and there's no reason, as the

18

Court recognized in McDonald, for that to

19

control when there's over 50 years of

20

precedent, beginning in Malloy versus Hogan,

21

Mapp, Aguilar, again in McDonald, rejecting

22

that two-track approach.

23

Adopting the two-track approach at

24

this late stage would only invite further

25

litigation about rights that are already

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

incorporated.

2

Fourth Amendment right to be free from having

3

your cell phone tracked in the Carpenter case,

4

if my friend's argument were correct, we would

5

have to relitigate whether that right applies

6

to the states.

7

When this Court interpreted the

Virtually all of the Bill of Rights,

8

with the one exception noted by Justice

9

Ginsburg, has been incorporated on the

10

right-by-right approach used in McDonald, not

11

on the application-by-application approach

12

proposed -­

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

There are a few others

14

that have not been incorporated, isn't that

15

right?

16

MR. HOTTOT:

Oh, that's true,

17

absolutely.

18

haven't been addressed by this Court, like in

19

the case of the Third Amendment right against

20

quartering soldiers, or because, as the Court

21

recognized in McDonald, they long predate the

22

era of selective incorporation.

23

But that's either because they

So I think it's possible that if the

24

rights at issue in Bombolis and Hurtado were to

25

come before this Court today, the results might

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

be different.

2

that history here because the history on the

3

question presented of whether the Excessive

4

Fines Clause applies to the states is clear.

5
6

But we don't have to get into

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what is the

provision in the Constitution that you rely on?

7

MR. HOTTOT:

The Section 1 of the

8

Fourteenth Amendment, Your Honor.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's a component of -­

10

of the liberty that's substantively -­

11

substantively protected by the Fourth

12

Amendment's Due Process Clause?

13

MR. HOTTOT:

Yes, Your Honor.

And we

14

also have an alternative argument under

15

Section 1's Privileges Or Immunities Clause.

16

And -­

17
18
19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

That would leave

out non-citizens?
MR. HOTTOT:

Yes, textually, Justice

20

Ginsburg, that would leave out non-citizens,

21

but, of course, Petitioner is a citizen, and

22

that could be a decision for another day.

23

also true that the fundamental and deeply

24

rooted rights that are currently incorporated

25

under the Due Process Clause apply to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It's

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

non-citizens and they would continue to do so

2

regardless of the Court's reasoning in this

3

case.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

can see there's different arguments about

6

whether -- and this, I gather, is the State's

7

primary submission -- whether excessive fines

8

are prohibited and whether civil in rem

9

forfeitures are.

10

Well, but you

And I certainly understand the

11

argument that the disproportion and

12

excessiveness arguments would be quite

13

different with respect to forfeiting the

14

instrumentalities of the crime.

15

argument could be made, well, that's always

16

proportionate since it's the way the crime is

17

accomplished.

18

MR. HOTTOT:

I mean, an

I don't agree, Your

19

Honor, because whatever might be said of

20

historic in rem forfeiture practices,

21

forfeitures today, like this one, are fines

22

within the meaning of the clause.

23

The Court was unanimous on that point

24

in Austin, and since then, it has reaffirmed

25

that point in the Bajakajian case, in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

Hudson case, and most recently in Kokesh, all

2

of which rely on Austin.

3
4

As a result, state and federal courts
today are -­

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, of

6

course, the -- the argument there was not for

7

the purposes we're talking about today in terms

8

of incorporation.

9

has been, you know, whether it's essential,

And if the test is, as it

10

fundamental, and all that, you can see a

11

distinction between saying, okay, you're going

12

to be fined $500,000 and saying, you know,

13

you're going to -- I mean, the action is not

14

against the individual.

15

asset.

16

use in crime.

It's against the

And so you will lose assets that you

17

MR. HOTTOT:

Well, that -­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The first one

19

sounds, yeah, that's pretty excessive.

20

second one, you can certainly argue, well, that

21

makes a lot of sense.

22

MR. HOTTOT:

The

Doubtless, Your Honor,

23

but these questions go to the excessiveness

24

analysis, not to the incorporation analysis

25

that is currently before the Court.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

When -- when the Court incorporated

2

the Second Amendment right to keep and bear

3

arms in the McDonald case, it had rejected that

4

right for 140 years, until the Heller decision,

5

and then, just two years later, incorporated it

6

against the states.

7

So there's no reason to require, as my

8

friend suggests should be required, that -­

9

that litigants show a historic pattern of the

10

right being enforced.

11

And, in any event, as the Court

12

recognized in Austin and Bajakajian and most

13

recently in -- in Kokesh, we're dealing with a

14

different animal.

15

in rem forfeiture, but it's a different animal

16

in that it's not just about personal

17

jurisdiction and pirate ships anymore; it's

18

about every person's property, and every

19

officer on the street now has the power to

20

strip people of their property.

21

It uses the same name, civil

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, your client was

22

convicted of an offense that was punishable by

23

a maximum of 10 years' imprisonment; am I

24

correct?

25

MR. HOTTOT:

Twenty years'

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

imprisonment.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

Twenty years'

3

imprisonment.

4

it was -- it ws suspended, right?

5

And he was sentenced to six, but

MR. HOTTOT:

That's correct, Your

6

Honor.

He was sentenced to home detention for

7

one year and then five years of probation, the

8

minimum on that scale.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, if he had been

10

sentenced to six years of actual imprisonment,

11

would that have been a violation of the Eighth

12

Amendment?

13

MR. HOTTOT:

Possibly, Your Honor.

We

14

would have to look at the -- the

15

proportionality to the gravity of the offense.

16

And for what it's worth, Judge Todd in rural

17

Grant County, Indiana, looked at this offense

18

and the impact on the community and determined

19

that it would be grossly disproportionate to

20

strip Petitioner of his property or even to

21

send him to prison.

22

And I think that's significant,

23

especially given that the Indiana -- the

24

Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed that

25

decision.

And the Indiana Supreme Court didn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

even address it because it didn't have an

2

opportunity to reach the excessiveness

3

question.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what have we

5

said about the application of the grossly

6

disproportionate standard?

7

MR. HOTTOT:

Well, Your Honor, as you

8

know, the -- the Court in Bajakajian

9

articulated that standard for the first time,

10

and it hasn't had an opportunity to address it

11

again since.

12
13

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I mean in the

context of -- of imprisonment, not fines.

14

MR. HOTTOT:

Oh, absolutely, Your

15

Honor.

16

Punishment Clause, the -- the Court has

17

articulated a very similar standard:

18

the punishment grossly disproportionate to the

19

gravity of the offense?

20

Well, under the Cruel and Unusual

Is -- is

And there's nothing -- there's nothing

21

radical about allowing trial judges at the end

22

of a proceeding to assess under all of the

23

circumstances, as this Court emphasized in

24

Bajakajian they should, even with respect to in

25

rem forfeitures.

That's something that trial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

judges do every day.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But -- but

3

your assumption is that you assess the

4

particular circumstances of the case.

5

I suppose if you ask people do you think six

6

months is an excessive sentence for whatever it

7

was, three counts of dealing in, you know,

8

hazardous illegal drugs, many people might say

9

no.

10

I mean,

It's only when you say, well, is six

11

months too much for the -- whatever the

12

circumstances were here, the much -- I don't

13

want to say insignificant, but lighter

14

quantities involved, what do you look at?

15

particular circumstances or what the crime is?

16

The crime is not dealing with tiny amounts of

17

drugs.

18

much broader than that.

19

The

The crime that he's convicted for is

MR. HOTTOT:

Your Honor, excessiveness

20

is "necessarily fact-intensive."

That's from

21

the Bajakajian case.

22

that's -- that's actually from the Second

23

Circuit's van Hofe case, which attempts -­

24

attempts to apply Bajakajian to the real-world

25

circumstances of an in rem forfeiture.

Excuse me, Your Honors,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

Blackstone recognized that as well.

2

There -- there's no way to assess the

3

disproportionality to the gravity of the

4

offense in the abstract.

5

incorporation question that's before the Court

6

today is easy to assess in the abstract.

7

By contrast, the

We ask ourselves not whether civil in

8

rem forfeitures -- a right against excessive in

9

rem forfeitures is somehow deeply rooted and,

10

hence, can be incorporated.

11

-- the freedom from excessive fines, which has

12

been recognized since the 13th Century, is

13

incorporated.

14

We ask whether the

And it's important to recognize that

15

the Indiana Supreme Court's decision in this

16

case did not adopt my friend's suggestion of

17

simply saying that it doesn't apply to in rem

18

forfeitures.

19

don't enjoy protection from excessive fines of

20

any kind.

21

The citizens of Indiana today

And that's true of the citizens of

22

three other jurisdictions, as we pointed out in

23

our petition for certiorari.

24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

If we were to assume

for the sake of argument that imprisonment for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

six years would not be an Eighth Amendment

2

violation for this offense, what would that say

3

about a fine of $42,000?

4

six years' imprisonment is not an Eighth

5

Amendment violation, but a fine of $42,000 is

6

an Eighth Amendment violation?

7

MR. HOTTOT:

Is it possible that

Well, Your Honor, we'd

8

have to know all of the circumstances of the

9

case.

And if we're talking about this

10

particular case, I think it's clear that the

11

judge on the ground that was closest to this

12

crime felt that it was grossly disproportionate

13

to the gravity.

14

This is a first-time offender who was

15

caught dealing a small amount of drugs.

16

the vehicle here was not used to -­

17
18

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

But we're talking

about a federal constitutional standard, not -­

19

MR. HOTTOT:

Of course.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- whatever sentencing

21

philosophy any one of the thousands of judges

22

in the United States who impose sentences might

23

think is the right sentence for a particular

24

crime and a particular offender.

25

MR. HOTTOT:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

But the question presented here is merely

2

whether a defendant in any case has the right

3

to interpose a defense under the Excessive

4

Fines Clause.

5

We're not asking the Court to

6

articulate a new standard of excessiveness.

7

We're not asking the Court to determine that

8

this forfeiture was or was not excessive.

9

We're merely emphasizing that part of

10

the purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to

11

guarantee to all 330 million Americans a right

12

to a defense under the Excessive Fines lause.

13

Indiana denied Petitioner that defense, and the

14

Court should reverse and remand.

15

Two state courts here struck down this

16

forfeiture, held that it was punitive under

17

Austin, believing that the clause already

18

applies to the states, and believing that this

19

forfeiture would be excessive.

20

The Indiana Supreme Court did not

21

address the excessiveness question.

22

"declined to find or assume incorporation"

23

until this Court "authoritatively holds that

24

the clause applies."

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It

Is there any in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

rem forfeiture, not this one, which relied on

2

the criminal activity of this defendant, but

3

let's say that Austin -- that the state did

4

away with innocent owner defense so that the

5

forfeiture was against the innocent owner.

6

Would that be punishment?

I think

7

under our -- my reading of Austin, it was that

8

only those forfeitures that are punitive count

9

under the clause.

10
11

So what can a state do to

take it out of its punitive nature?
MR. HOTTOT:

Well, it's important to

12

recognize that Austin says that, if the

13

forfeiture is at least partly punitive, it

14

comes within the confines of the clause.

15

forfeiture -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So a

So they do away

17

with the innocent owner defense, and the

18

innocent owner comes in and says, this is my

19

property, I didn't commit a crime.

20

it's too bad.

21

MR. HOTTOT:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. HOTTOT:

They say

Well, I -­
The property did.

I think, Your Honor, it's

24

-- it's safe to say that that could be deemed

25

excessive.

If -- if we look at the Bennis

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

case, that case is about a co-owner who didn't

2

commit the crime.

3

a matter of federal substantive due process,

4

that co-owner did not have a -- an innocent

5

owner defense.

6

And the Court held that, as

But that does not dictate that the -­

7

that that co-owner couldn't articulate an

8

excessive fines defense.

9

Indeed, three -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

MR. HOTTOT:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why?

Well, three -­
If it's not

12

punitive against him, it's the property that is

13

being charged -­

14

MR. HOTTOT:

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

16

19

-- with having

been involved in a crime.

17
18

I see.

MR. HOTTOT:

I see your question, Your

Honor.
I think that if someone had done

20

nothing wrong -- let us say that someone steals

21

my car as I'm walking into a Target, commits a

22

bank robbery, and the police seize that vehicle

23

quite righteously, I mean, as a practical

24

matter, of course, the police are going to

25

return the vehicle to me.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

But, if the state were to go so far as

2

to institute forfeiture proceedings against

3

that person, as Justice Kennedy recognized in

4

his Austin concurrence, there would be several

5

serious constitutional problems with that.

6

And it -- it may be that in those

7

circumstances, where I'm entirely blameless,

8

that the Court would hold that there is a

9

substantive due process right to reject that

10

forfeiture, or the Court would find it to be

11

grossly disproportionate to the gravity of the

12

nonexistent defense.

13

So I think Bennis can be easily

14

reconciled with this case, particularly when -­

15

when the Court looks at Justice Stevens'

16

dissent in Bennis, which with two other

17

Justices points out that Mrs. Bennis didn't

18

bring an excessive fines defense.

19

so, at least those three Justices would have

20

been inclined to rule in her favor.

21

JUSTICE ALITO:

Had she done

So you're saying even

22

if it's a classic in rem forfeiture of a kind

23

that's been known for centuries, that would

24

potentially violate the Excessive Fines Clause?

25

MR. HOTTOT:

Yes, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

This

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

Court has rejected the idea that states can

2

work their way around the Excessive Fines

3

Clause based on nothing more than a label.

4

This is not a labeling game.

The

5

Court looks to the substance of what's

6

happening.

7

the Kokesh decision, that, you know, fines,

8

penalties, they sometimes serve several

9

purposes.

10

It emphasized that most recently in

But, with respect to civil in rem

11

forfeitures, if any of those purposes are

12

punitive in nature, then the defense can be

13

raised.

14

And that makes sense.
JUSTICE BREYER:

What is the situation

15

with jail, prison?

I have a vague recollection

16

-- often such recollections are incorrect -­

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- but I have a vague

19

recollection that there was a case in which

20

California's three-strike law was applied to

21

sentence to life a person whose final offense

22

was stealing an $80 golf club.

23

majority said, no, we're not going to look at

24

that because it's too complicated.

25

Am I right?

And I think the

Does that ring a bell?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

Because if -- if that still is the

2

law, which I think it is, it's something

3

anomalous about saying, by the way, if you took

4

his Mercedes, we will look to see whether

5

that's disproportionate to taking a golf club,

6

but if you send him to jail for life, we won't.

7

Now have -- have I stated this

8

correctly and, if so, how do we -- how do we

9

deal with it?

10

MR. HOTTOT:

Well, Your Honor, I think

11

the most relevant authority here is the

12

Harmelin decision in which this Court, similar

13

to the situation you're describing, allowed a

14

person to be sentenced from -- a person from

15

Michigan to be sentenced to life without the

16

possibility of parole for having 650 grams of,

17

I believe it was cocaine.

18

And the Court reasoned that, look,

19

that amount of cocaine could be broken up and

20

easily used for distribution, so it's

21

appropriate in these circumstances to punish

22

that harshly.

23

Here, we're dealing with two grams -­

What is the equation between the -­

2

the monetary -- between dollars in -- in a fine

4

MR. HOTTOT:

Your -- Your Honor,

5

although it might be unsatisfying, the Court

6

has said repeatedly that there is no equation

7

and that there can be no equation because these

8

situations are inherently real-world in nature

9

and that courts have been directed,

10

specifically with respect to in rem forfeitures

11

in the Bajakajian case, to assess all of the

12

circumstances.

13

And -- and as Justice Ginsburg was

14

assisting me, it -- it's absolutely the case

15

that the court has to look at not just the

16

value of the property, not just the gravity of

17

the offense, but also the offender himself and

18

his effect, potentially, on the community if he

19

remains at large.

that.

we're saying is that you have an excessive

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So we are several

steps removed, but I think that the import of

5

some of these questions is, look, we've made it

MR. HOTTOT:

That's potentially true,

Your Honor, but the standard of assessing this

type of economic sanction, it's important to

recognize, is being developed as we speak in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but

6

you're asking us to, you know, buy a pig in a

7

poke; in other words, you're saying incorporate

8

this, but, you know, we're -- we don't even

9

know whether it means we're going to decide

10

whether $10,000 is enough or $20,000, or if

11

we're simply going to say something along the

12

lines of Harmelin, which it's not just that

13

it's whatever so many grams; it's that it's the

14

third offense, and so that's -- that's what's

15

the -- protection against that is fundamental

16

to -- to a civilized society or whatever the

17

standard is that we've been applying.

18

MR. HOTTOT:

Well -­

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And you say

20

don't worry about what it means; just

21

incorporate it and then figure it out later on.

22

MR. HOTTOT:

Your Honor, I'm not

23

saying don't worry about it.

I think that this

24

is a pressing question, and in an appropriate

25

case, I -- I think that the Court does need to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

take it up.

2

But if we look to the Harmelin

3

decision, Justice Scalia's opinion in that case

4

points out that there is special reason to be

5

concerned when the government uses economic

6

sanctions to punish a person because, unlike

7

all other forms of punishment, whether it be

8

life imprisonment, Justice Alito, or -- or a

9

three strikes law, those cost the government

10
11

money.
But these types of forfeitures and

12

fines raise revenue.

13

there's good history, for being concerned about

14

the sovereign power to raise revenue using

15

punishment.

16

And there's good reason,

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, let me give you

17

two examples.

What -- suppose your client,

18

instead of using a -- a Land Rover, was it?

19

MR. HOTTOT:

Yes.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yes, a Land Rover, had

21

been using a 15-year-old Kia or, at the other

22

extreme, suppose that he used a Bugatti, which

23

costs like a quarter of a million dollars.

Would the Excessive Fine Clause apply

25

differently in those three cases?

be different?

car with a -- a book value of $1500, would the

result be different?

MR. HOTTOT:

would have to know more.

what the gravity of the offense was.

JUSTICE ALITO:

We would have to know

it's the offense we have here.

MR. HOTTOT:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

15

It is -­

Okay.
We know what the

offense is.
MR. HOTTOT:

I -- I think in this

16

instance, any forfeiture of the vehicle would

17

be excessive because this vehicle was not

18

instrumental to this crime.

19

It was incidental.

It's no surprise that -- in rural

20

Indiana that a -- a person might drive

21

somewhere to -- to meet with someone.

22

doesn't make this vehicle somehow like a pirate

23

ship that had been sailing the high seas.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

And that

Well, that's

contrary to a lot of civil forfeiture law.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

mean, this was an instrumentality of the crime.

2

This is how he got to the -- the deal place and

how he carried the drugs.

you're carrying the -- the drugs in your car, I

think it's pretty well established your -- your

car can be forfeited.

7

MR. HOTTOT:

Normally, I mean,

Potentially, Your Honor.

8

It's -- it's well established that the car is

9

subject to forfeiture.

It is not, however,

10

well established that that would necessarily

11

not be excessive.

12

So if we look -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, does it

13

make a difference -- we've been talking about

14

the value of the -- the item.

15

the person doing this, you know, was a

multimillionaire?

17

doesn't seem excessive to him.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Forty-two thousand dollars

And -- and

20

yet, if someone is impoverished, it is

excessive?

22

Does that matter?

MR. HOTTOT:

Well, Your Honor, if the

23

Court looks to the brief of the Eighth

24

Amendment scholars, filed in support of neither

25

party, they discuss this.

Magna Carta had the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

principle of salvo contenemento, the idea that

2

you can't take from a man so much that he would

3

be destitute.

4

And the Court has suggested that -- in

5

-- in the -- in the Bajakajian case, that that

6

might be a factor, but it -- but it

specifically declined in Bajakajian to

articulate factors, recognizing that this is

highly contextual, highly fact-intensive, and

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In rem forfeitures have been a feature

of the Anglo-American judicial system for

hundreds of years, but until about 25 years

24

ago, no court had held that they were subject

Whether this particular fine qualifies because

it's an in rem forfeiture, another question.

We all agree that the Excessive Fines

theoretical question off the table, whether you

want to do it through the Due Process Clause

gosh, excessive fines, guarantees against them

go back to Magna Carta and 1225, the English

Bill of Rights, the Virginia Declaration of

Rights, pretty deep history, or whether one

wants to look at privileges and immunities, you

might come to the same conclusion.

MR. FISHER:

you -- you have to take into account -- and

this is the methodology of McDonald.

5

to take into account the history and traditions

of the right being claimed.

7

You have

Now the right being claimed here is a

8

right of proportionality as to in rem

The Court has to grapple with

that history, which is really not seriously

11

contested that that was never subject to

proportionality -­

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, whatever the

Excessive Fine Clause guarantees, we can argue,

again, about its scope and in rem and in

applies against the states, right?

depends.

of these incorporation cases took place in like

MR. FISHER:

6

you have to take into account, though, is the

history, and you have to take into account all

8

the history, not just the in personam history,

9

the in rem history.

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, for the

11

clause, why do you have to take into account

12

all of the history, to pick up on Justice

13

Gorsuch's question?

14

the day to argue that any of the Bill of Rights

15

is not incorporated?

16

MR. FISHER:

Isn't it just too late in

The Court has never

17

incorporated a right against the states where

18

it could not conclude that there was a

19

relationship that was fundamental or -- and

20

deeply rooted in our history and tradition.

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But aren't -- but

22

aren't all -- all the Bill of Rights at this

point in our conception of what they stand for,

23

which is civil and not criminal.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

And that distinction does not

The so-called modern-day forfeitures

If I -- if I

understood your response to Justice Gorsuch, it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

was essentially that we can't answer the

2

question wholesale, that we have to look at the

3

particular right being invoked.

4

So I guess the question is, do you

5

have a theory about how we go about dividing up

6

rights?

7

looking at a particular right against in rem

8

forfeitures as opposed to a general right

9

against excessive fines?

10

You know, how do we decide that we're

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think McDonald

11

gives us some instruction on that.

12

talked about not simply the Second Amendment

13

but about the right to self-defense in the

14

home.

15

McDonald

Other cases of incorporation this

16

Court has decided have approached, for example,

17

reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment as

18

distinguished from, you know, the exclusionary

19

rule.

20

There are -- there are precedents that

21

do that, but there is no precedent where the

22

Court has incorporated a right that was not

23

deeply rooted or fundamental.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I mean, that seems to

make the incorporation question sort of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

indistinguishable from the substantive

2

question.

3

MR. FISHER:

I think you have to come

4

to grips with the history, whether you just -­

whether you call it incorporation or you call

6

it the substantive merits question.

7

given you three different ways to do this.

We've

The most historically sound way is to

If you don't want to do that,

you can -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Wait a minute,

12

counsel, you know, if -- if -- just -- just to

13

pause on that for a second, you know, the

14

Indiana Supreme Court didn't address the merits

15

questions, didn't address any of this

16

forfeiture, in rem, in personam.

17

that the Excessive Fines Clause is not

18

incorporated, period.

It just said

19

Why isn't that just wrong?

20

you can go make these arguments about why it

21

doesn't apply to this case on remand.

22
23
24
25

And then

Do you really want us to answer the
merits questions too?
MR. FISHER:

Well, the problem with

relying on lower court percolation on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

merits question, in terms of whether Austin is

2

correct, is that Austin binds the lower courts.

3

They don't have an opportunity to revisit that.

4
5

This Court does.

The matter has

been -- has been -­

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

Let's say

7

this Court's not inclined to revisit Austin.

8

You're going to lose not just the incorporation

9

question but the merits question too.

10

Could these work?

11

MR. FISHER:

Well, I'm not sure what

12

you mean by the -- the merits question in that

13

regard.

14

forfeiture is excessive, certainly, that

15

discussion would -- and that argument would

16

take place back in the Indiana Supreme Court.

With respect to whether this

17

With respect to the meaning of Austin,

18

whether Austin remains good, I think, you know,

19

that's only something this Court can effect.

20

And I think, with respect to the

21

broader question, even if the question, Justice

22

Kagan, is -- is -- is the Excessive Fines

23

Clause as a whole, and not something where

24

we're going to slice and dice the rights, we

25

still have to take into account that history of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

in rem forfeiture.

2

examples of incorporation where there is this

3

substantial history that calls into question

4

the fundamental or deeply rooted nature of a -­

5

a -- a very large, you know, area where that

6

right would be applied.

7

And we don't have any

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But we do have

8

relatively recent history calling into question

9

the division between in rem and in personam.

10

Certainly, in the area of personal

11

jurisdiction, it was once quasi in rem

12

jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction, and

13

yet, in Shaffer against Heitner, the Court said

14

we're not going to do that anymore.

15

process controls both.

16

Due

So, whether you label it in rem or in

17

personam, let's remember that it's -- things

18

don't have rights or obligations in and of

19

themselves.

20

obligations with respect to things.

21

It's people that have rights or

MR. FISHER:

Well, with respect to

22

Shaffer, I think what's critical there is the

23

word "quasi" because, of course, it was not a

24

straight-up in rem proceeding.

25

We're talking about the ability to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

seize assets for a case where there had been an

2

in personam judgment.

3

distinguishes that category of cases from the

4

historical in rem forfeitures we're talking

5

about.

6

And that is -- that

In rem is still critical for

7

jurisdictional reasons, for -- it comes up in

8

sovereign immunity.

9

that we can't assert sovereign immunity the

It binds the states there

10

same way when we've got an in rem proceeding.

11

You've got other situations.

12

We already have a distinction in the double

13

jeopardy context where in rem is critical.

14

I don't think we can just wave -- you know,

15

wave it away.

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Double jeopardy.

So

What is the difference

17

between the approach that you're advocating

18

here and the way the Court used to address the

19

question whether rights protected by the Bill

20

of Rights apply to the states, before it began

21

the process of incorporating provisions of the

22

Bill of Rights one by one, and it said that

23

what applied to the states were those rights

24

that were implicit in the concept of ordered

25

liberty.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

So there was a two-tiered system.

2

that seems to be what you're asking us to go

back to with respect to the Excessive Fines

Clause.

Is there a difference?

I -- I don't -- could you explain what is the

difference between those two approaches?

MR. FISHER:

Yes, indeed.

suggesting some sort of systematic differential

treatment.

12

that the differences that exist between the -­

the Bill of Rights rights that apply to the

federal government and the states are as a

15

matter of stare decisis.

16

In McDonald, the Court acknowledged

Now, here, what we're saying is if

17

that -- if the -- in the analysis, because of

18

the lack of historical roots of the in rem

19

proportionality right, there ends up being a

20

difference, that has to be based on the stare

21

decisis of Austin.

22

If Austin remains good law only

23

because of stare decisis, that puts it in the

24

same category as those other cases.

25

systematic federalism discount, if you will, on

JUSTICE ALITO:

But, if Austin were

overruled, then the rule as applicable to the

4

federal government would change as well?

5

MR. FISHER:
right.

That's right.

That's

We would be in the same -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

So I'm still not

seeing the difference between them.
MR. FISHER:

Well, the difference

10

would be, if -- if you look at Austin -- if you

11

were to look at Austin and say, you know what,

12

Austin was dead right, historically -- this is

13

historically rooted and it is fundamental, then

14

I don't think there's any grounds for us to say

15

that there should be -- that the outcome should

16

be any different between the states and the

17

federal government.

18

If you look at Austin and you say, you

19

know what, that's questionable, but we don't

20

want to overturn it because stare decisis

21

principles counsel against that, that's a -­

22

that's a different analysis, and that's more

23

like Hurtado, more like Bombolis.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

Well, isn't that

pretty much what the dissent in McDonald said?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

We don't like Heller, but at least let's just

2

keep it applicable to the District of Columbia

3

and the federal government and not apply it to

4

the states.

5

MR. FISHER:

Well, I think that was a

6

-- a different -- for a different reason in

7

that the plurality acknowledged the distinction

8

with Bombolis and Hurtado being purely a matter

9

of stare decisis.

And that's the basic

10

principle we're -- we're calling on here, which

11

is, if -- if Austin remains good law only

12

because of stare decisis, that doesn't make

13

this a systematic sort of discounted right.

14

That just means that, you know, you've

15

got as a question -- question of the Court's

16

history some other way you have to look at the

17

situation.

18

But I think it's critical to

19

understand also that the idea that somehow

20

so-called modern in rem forfeitures are

21

different from history because of the existence

22

of innocent owner exceptions is also not

23

correct.

24

Innocent owner exceptions did exist

25

within, you know, the last couple of hundred

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

years.

2

with the ratification or roughly

3

contemporaneous with the ratification of the

4

Fourteenth Amendment acknowledged that there -­

5

there might be innocent owner defenses.

6

Indeed, authorities contemporaneous

The treatise by Bishop says, if the

7

law in its clemency permits an innocent owner

8

to make a claim, that does not convert into

9

punishment that which was not already

10

punishment.

11

It doesn't make any difference.

So whether we -- no matter how we look

12

at in rem forfeitures today and the features

13

that they exhibit, they're no different than

14

the historical in rem forfeitures that this

15

Court has said in -- in cases after Austin

16

calling Austin into question that they were not

17

punishment.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, in your view,

19

an in rem civil forfeiture is not an excessive

20

fine, is that right?

21

MR. FISHER:

22
23

Yes, that is -- that is

true.
JUSTICE BREYER:

So what is to happen

24

if a state needing revenue says anyone who

25

speeds has to forfeit the Bugatti, Mercedes, or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

a special Ferrari or even jalopy?

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. FISHER:

There -- no, there is no

4

-- there is no excessive fines issue there.

5

-- what I will say and what I think is

6

important to -- to remember is that there is a

7

constitutional limit, which is the proof of

8

instrumentality, the need to prove nexus.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That isn't a problem

10

because it was the Bugatti in which he was

11

speeding.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. FISHER:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

I

Right.
So -- so there is all

the nexus.

16

MR. FISHER:

Historically -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Now I just wonder,

18

what -- what is it?

19

that just permissible under the Constitution?

20
21
22
23

MR. FISHER:

What is it?

That -- is

To forfeit the Bugatti

for speeding?
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah, and, by the

way, it was only five miles an hour -­

24

MR. FISHER:

Yeah.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- above the speed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

limit.

2

MR. FISHER:

3

answer is yes.

4

to the -­

Well, you know, the

And I would call your attention

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

6

MR. FISHER:

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. FISHER:

9

Is it yes?

Yes, it's forfeitable.
It is forfeitable?

Yeah.

The Louisa Barber

case, one person over the -- the passenger

10

limit and the entire ship is forfeit.

11

-- history shows us in rem forfeiture -­

12
13

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is

So if the airplane is

speeding -­

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. FISHER:

Well, in rem forfeitures

16

have -- have -- have always been with us and

17

they have always been harsh.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

General, yeah,

19

that -- that is true, but that's because at a

20

certain -- up to a certain point in our

21

history, we didn't apply the Bill of Rights to

22

the states.

23

So, in all of the situations before we

24

apply the Bill of Rights to this -- before we

25

apply the Bill of Rights to states, they did

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

things that, under incorporation, were

2

unconstitutional.

3

they were history going both ways.

4

did; some states didn't.

5

And in most of our cases,
Some states

So, really, what the issue that we

6

have to look at isn't -- is where has our

7

understanding come to in terms of a particular

8

Bill of Rights?

9

long part of history that punitive sanctions

And in Austin, we said it is a

10

cannot be excessive.

11

it very well:

12

limit cash fines while permitting -- permitting

13

limitless in-kind assessments would make little

14

sense, altering only the form of the Star

15

Chamber abuses.

16

And Justice Scalia said

For the Eighth Amendment to

So, at a certain point in Austin, we

17

looked at what had happened to in rem

18

forfeiture and realized that we had just

19

changed the Star Chamber form.

20

I -- I -- I don't actually understand

21

your argument based on history because, without

22

incorporation, the history's going to be what

23

you want it to be.

24

fundamental right.

25

The real question is the

Are we trying to avoid a society

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

that's like the Char -- Star Chamber?

2

we look at these forfeitures that are occurring

3

today, and that's what Austin documented, many

4

of them seem grossly disproportionate to the

5

crimes being charged.

6
7
8
9

And if

So how do you deal with that?

How do

we avoid a Star Chamber return?
MR. FISHER:

Well, the history that's

relevant is not simply the history of what

10

states were doing.

11

what the federal government was doing.

12

there was no suggestion that before the civil

13

rights amendments were passed that the federal

14

government, when all of its harsh in rem

15

forfeitures, was somehow violating the

16

Excessive Fines Clause.

17

proportionality limit there.

18

It's also the history of
And

There was no

Now I think, with respect to

19

understanding, you know, how we view today's

20

forfeitures, you can't distinguish what's

21

happening now from historically -- history

22

when, historically, an innocent owner was

23

never -- you know, not entitled to a defense.

24
25

How -- how would we ever say -- and I
think Justice Scalia makes this point -- how

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

would we ever say that a forfeiture as to an

2

innocent owner was proportional because the

3

owner is innocent?

4
5
6

So the -- that has never been part of
the equation.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, the -- the

7

part that's different about modern forfeitures

8

-- and I think this is what Justice Sotomayor's

9

getting at -- is that many of them are punitive

10

to the person and that that was not part of in

11

rem forfeitures at common law.

12

MR. FISHER:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well -­
We're dealing with a

14

world in which it's different in kind, not just

15

degree, not just a number but in kind.

16

that's what Justice Scalia, that's what

17

everybody, in Austin agreed on.

18

unanimous.

19

MR. FISHER:

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And

That much was

Well -­
And I guess I'm

21

asking you, given the concession by the State

22

before the Indiana Supreme Court that the

23

forfeiture here was punitive, if we do -- don't

24

overrule Austin, and you want us to apply not

25

just the question of incorporation but go to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

the merits, don't you lose?

2

MR. FISHER:

No, I don't think we lose

3

because I don't think -- the -- the question of

4

punitive and remedial is -- is something that

5

Austin borrowed from Halper.

6

has been overruled as to -- as to double

7

jeopardy.

That test has -­

8

Now, if it remains the test with

9

respect to something that -- whether it's

10

encompassed within the Excessive Fines Clause,

11

there still has to be the -- the analysis.

12

mean, we have to figure out what

13

disproportionate means.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Sure.

15

conceded that it's punitive.

16

question of proportionality.

17

MR. FISHER:

I

But you

Now it becomes a

But -- but I don't think

18

you can take these on a case-by-case basis.

I

19

think it's -- you have to say what is the right

20

being claimed.

21

particular forfeiture was punitive or not.

22

It's a question of whether in rem forfeitures

23

are of the -- of the sort that are swept within

24

the Excessive Fines Clause.

25

they -­

It's not whether this

And, historically,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The statute here

2

says it's punitive and you've conceded the

3

statute's punitive.

4

-- how do you get out of that box?

5

MR. FISHER:

So I'm still stuck on how

Well, I -- I suppose -- I

6

mean, if -- if that's -- if it's the magic word

7

"punitive," we can just change the statute, but

8

I don't think that would be a very satisfactory

9

result.

10

I think what the Court is probably

11

looking for is some better way to -- to

12

describe what is included within the Excessive

13

Fines Clause, something more substantive than

14

that.

15

clear that this distinction between punitive

16

and remedial simply falls apart.

And the cases after Austin all make

17

You know, you -- the idea of

18

deterrence in Austin, the thought was, if it's

19

deterrent, that makes it punishment.

20

Court's now rejected that in Hudson and in

21

other cases.

22

of the test doesn't hold up anymore either.

23

So I think you have to go back and

And in Bajakajian.

Well, the

So that part

24

look at this entire -- you know, whether -- you

25

have to look very critically at the idea that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

there's something different about modern-day

2

forfeitures.

3

no material distinction, between them and what

4

was happening at common law and certainly what

5

was happening in the middle of the 19th

6

Century.

7

There really is no distinction,

So I think the other critical thing to

8

bear in mind here is that if we get into the

9

idea that we're somehow going to apply a

10

grossly disproportionate test akin to the way

11

it comes up in -- in the in personam cases,

12

effectively, you're going to be wiping away

13

centuries of -- of precedent, not just Bennis

14

but other innocent owner cases, Van Oster, the

15

Little Charles, the Malek Adhel, all these

16

cases that say that an innocent owner has no

17

constitutional defense.

18

And if it somehow has to come down to

19

the relationship between the -- the guilt of

20

the owner and the crime, then those precedents,

21

I think, simply cannot stand any longer.

22

think you're -- you're in this situation where

23

you're confronted with which -- you know, which

24

source of doctrine are we going to override.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So I

Well, are we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

going to be wiping all that away or just

2

leaving that for another day?

3

-- what -- I guess this gets back to Justice

4

Gorsuch's first question.

5

I mean, it -- it

I mean, the question presented is does

6

the Excessive Fines Clause -- you know, is it

7

incorporated in the Eighth Amendment?

8

guess your argument is -- seems to be this

9

isn't an excessive fine, and, in fact, it isn't

10

a fine at all.

11
12

And I

Well, we can deal with that later,
right?

13

MR. FISHER:

Well, first of all, of

14

course, it's in front of you now, so why not.

15

It's been -- you know, it's been briefed and

16

the lower courts can't come to any opposite

17

conclusion.

18

percolate.

19

So you're not -- it's not going to

But the second point is that even if

20

we were to say we're not going to revisit

21

Austin, the history of the right is still

22

critical.

23

to inform the question of incorporation.

24
25

McDonald tells us that.

And it has

And the Court has never incorporated
where there's that kind of history that is four

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

square against the right that's being claimed.

2

And I think that that is going to have to

3

inform the way -­

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you just

5

-- you just want us to make sure that in our

6

opinion that we say, if we're ruling against

7

you, that the excessive fines are incorporate

8

-- incorporated under -- under our

9

incorporation doctrine and not say civil in rem

10

forfeitures are incorporated?

11

MR. FISHER:

Well, but if that's all

12

the Court says, unfortunately, the lower courts

13

are going to then read Austin and say, well,

14

you're at civil in rem and so that's part of

15

excessive fines.

16

you know, going to have a court that's going to

17

create any kind of -- of -- of, you know,

18

dispute on that point?

19
20
21
22
23
24
25

And -- and when are we ever,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, just so I'm

clear, you're asking us to overrule Austin?
MR. FISHER:

I think that's the most

historically -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Because that's the

only way that you can win with a straight face?
MR. FISHER:

No, I don't -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

(Laughter.)

2

MR. FISHER:

Not with a straight face.

3

No.

Look, I think that's the most historically

4

sound thing to do.

5

that's -- if you're unwilling to do that, that

6

cannot be the -- the end of the analysis on

7

incorporation because, again, you have to take

8

into account under your precedents the history

9

of the right being claimed.

10

But I don't think that

Not just some of the history, not just

11

the in personam history, but also the in rem

12

history.

13

And there's no -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, again, it -- it

14

just seems as though there are two questions,

15

and one question is incorporating the right,

16

and the other question is the scope of the

17

right to be incorporated.

18

And, really, what you're arguing is

19

about the scope of the right.

20

MR. FISHER:

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

Well, but I'm -­

the right -­

23

MR. FISHER:

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

And we can incorporate

Yeah.
-- without saying a

word about the scope of the right.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

Now, as you say, Austin says something

2

about the scope of the right, and that's a

3

problem for you.

4

asking us to talk about the scope of the right,

5

aren't you?

6

But -- but you're really

MR. FISHER:

Well, certainly, that

7

would -- that's our -- what we think is the

8

most historically sound thing to do, but even

9

if you, you know, assume that away and were

10

just looking at what this -- whether we're

11

going to incorporate the right, the test for

12

incorporation is historically rooted or -- or

13

fundamental to ordered liberty.

14

And to answer that question, you have

15

to look at the history of the right.

16

right includes -­

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If the

Well, that's why -­

18

why I asked at the beginning what's your theory

19

for how you define the right and which history

20

you look to -­

21

MR. FISHER:

Yeah.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- because you're

23

really suggesting that we don't take the right

24

wholesale; we try to chop it up.

25

you know, there are always going to be

And I guess,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

questions about the scope of the right to be

2

incorporated.

3

And, so far, we have not addressed

4

those questions when we've decided whether to

5

flip the switch of incorporation or not.

6

understood those questions to be distinct

7

and -- and to be questions for another day.

We've

8

And why is it that you're saying we

9

should not use that pretty standard practice

10

and instead start chopping up the right at the

11

incorporation stage?

12

MR. FISHER:

13
14

to do it.

We think that's one way

We don't think that's the only way.
And if, indeed, the Court doesn't want

15

to chop up the right and it wants to just look

16

at the Excessive Fines Clause, it has to look

17

at all the history, and that includes the

18

history of in rem.

19

And our view is that history means

20

that you can't incorporate.

21

history is only in personam, then I don't think

22

there's any serious question about

23

incorporation.

24
25

If -- if the

But if the history includes the in rem
history, the much larger history, the much -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

the largely uncontested history, that is -­

2

then there is no precedent for incorporating in

3

that circumstance where -- where there was that

4

amount of history standing four square against

5

a substantial number of applications of the

6

right.

7

that.

8
9

There just isn't anything to look to on

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You cited McDonald

as an example earlier of a case where the Court

10

had, in your view, chopped up the right as

11

incorporated.

12

Amendment has a different scope after McDonald?

13

Are you saying the Second

MR. FISHER:

Oh, no, no, no.

No, what

14

-- what I'm saying is that the methodology of

15

McDonald, when doing the incorporation

16

analysis, was to ask, what's the right being

17

claimed?

18

right to have guns in the home for

19

self-defense.

20

as to how you look at the right.

21

And the right being claimed was the

And we think that's instructive

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But you agree

22

post-McDonald -- and this is similar, I think,

23

to what Justice Kagan's asking -- that the -­

24

the right is the same as against the states and

25

the federal government?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

MR. FISHER:

Oh, yes.

Oh, yes.

But,

2

again, we're not dealing there with the same

3

stare decisis issue that we are grappling with

4

with respect to Austin, which I think is -­

5

puts this in -- more like in the Hurtado and

6

Bombolis category.

7

We're not asking for a -- again, we're

8

not asking for a federalism discount.

What

9

we're asking for is some ability to take

10

cognizance of -- of stare decisis without

11

sacrificing the necessary historical analysis.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, at the time of

13

McDonald and at the present time, all the -­

14

the Court has held that the Second Amendment

15

right protects the right to have certain

16

firearms in the home for self-defense.

17

hasn't gone further.

18

It

But, if this Court were to go further,

19

let's say in a case -- in another case

20

involving the District of Columbia, and said

21

that the right included something more than

22

that, would we have to go through another round

23

of incorporation inquiry to determine whether

24

this broader right applies to the state, or

25

would it follow automatically under McDonald

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1
2

that it -- it applies to the states?
MR. FISHER:

Well, I think

3

particularly given the methodology the Court

4

would use in coming to grips with what that new

5

right is, it would likely just follow.

6

see there would be any need for -- because it

7

would be essentially the same analysis anyway.

8

But you -- you know, I think the idea

9

I don't

here that you can simply look at one part of

10

the history without looking at all of it, you

11

know, I don't think that you can look to -- to

12

McDonald or any of the other precedents and

13

have guidance for that.

14

You have to take -- you can't just

15

ignore it.

16

You have to take it into account.

17

that means chopping it up or, you know,

18

grappling with the right as a whole and saying

19

that that history counsels against

20

incorporation, or simply overruling Austin,

21

that's -- you know, one of these ways has to

22

take into account the in rem history.

23

You have to do something with it.
And whether

So, you know, that's -- I think, you

24

know, we offer those -- those three suggestions

25

and -- and, you know, we -- we think

1

historically, the most historically sound thing

2

to do is to overrule Austin.

3

So I think, you know, we've got also

4

grounds for saying that Austin is -- I think

5

fits within the Court's precedents on when to

6

overrule cases notwithstanding stare decisis.

7

In -- in Hudson, this Court has

8

already said that the test that Austin applies

9

that comes out of Halper is unworkable.

It has

10

gone through the history in Bajakajian and

11

largely shown that Austin was wrongly decided.

12

There isn't any serious reliance

13

interest, I think, that would mean that there

14

was going to be some sort of disruption if

15

Austin were overruled.

16

normal factors the Court takes into account

17

with respect to its precedents, I think, are

18

not barriers here to over -- overruling Austin.

19

So, you know, the

And the -- the other thing, I think,

20

you know, you -- you almost can't get away from

21

the prospect of at least implicitly overruling

22

precedent no matter what you do here.

23

not going to be Austin, then it's going to be

24

the innocent owner cases, Bennis, Van Oster,

25

all those precedents.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If it's

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

And I think it's instructive here that

2

my friend cites to the dissent in Bennis,

3

acknowledging that, if you're going to

4

incorporate a grossly disproportionate

5

analysis, then, really, what you've got to do

6

is start getting away from the innocent owner,

7

you know, the lack of a required innocent owner

8

exception, that that's going to become

9

something that is going to have to be part of

10

that analysis.

11

Now Justice Scalia, I -- I do want to

12

call your attention to in -- in Austin, in his

13

concurrence, was grappling with this -- this

14

idea, as can we do something that's grossly

15

disproportionate on in rem the way we would do

16

it in personam.

17

And his concern was, you know what,

18

maybe really what it comes down to is simply

19

this idea of nexus.

20

was describing there is essentially what we're

21

describing that would be the proper test under

22

due process.

23

And the nexus test that he

You know, is there a connection

24

between the property and the offense?

25

think that belongs in due process.

And we

But Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Scalia, I think, was onto something there when

2

he was acknowledging that there really has to

3

be a different treatment.

4

history, given all those -- those precedents of

5

the Court, there has to be a differential

6

treatment.

7

Given all that

And at the end of the day, I think,

8

you know, what you've got to do here when

9

you're looking at this incorporation question

10

is not simply be, you know, I think, you know,

11

cavalier about the idea of this is easy to

12

incorporate.

13

You don't want to do that, I think,

14

without taking a very careful look at what is

15

the right that you're actually incorporating

16

and does it fit with the doctrines and the

17

history of the Court and all of the ways that

18

it's handled incorporation before.

20

And if there's nothing else, I'll cede
the remainder of my time.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF WESLEY P. HOTTOT

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. HOTTOT:

Your Honors, this case is

4

about constitutional housekeeping.

5

over the last 30 years, this Court has remarked

6

that the freedom from excessive economic

7

sanctions should be understood to apply to the

8

states.

9

Five times

In Hall, in Kennedy, in Roper, in

10

Cooper Industries, and in Booth, all that

11

remains to do is to expressly so hold.

12

My friend's approach, by contrast, is

13

radical.

14

a unanimous decision that has been on the books

15

for 25 years, that was reaffirmed in Hudson, in

16

Bajakajian, and, again, in Kokesh.

17

He asks the Court to overrule Austin,

And that case looked at the same

18

history that my friend urges this Court to

19

review here.

20

to overrule Austin, governments at all levels

21

to impose constitutionally excessive civil in

22

rem forfeitures based on nothing more than a

23

label.

It would allow, if the Court were

24

This is not a labeling game.

25

It would also revive the so-called

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

two-track approach that this Court has rejected

2

now for more than 50 years.

3

So even if we imagine that -- that the

4

Court would take such a radical approach, it -­

5

it would break with, for example, the

6

commercial speech doctrine, which there was a

7

long history of commercial speech activity in

8

this country before the 1970s decision in which

9

this Court held that there is a commercial

10

speech right, and did so in a case against the

11

state without even pausing on the incorporation

12

question.

13

So, you know, even if some forfeitures

14

are non-punitive, other forfeitures are

15

punitive.

16

clearly meets Austin's test that it be at least

17

partly punitive.

And the forfeiture in this case

18

If the Court looks to Indiana Code

19

34-24-1-4(a), it shows that this statute is

20

more punitive than the statute at issue in

21

Austin because it required the -- the state in

22

its case-in-chief to prove that Petitioner knew

23

about or should have known about the crime at

24

issue here, and that is not true under 21

25

U.S.C. 881, the statute at issue in Austin.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Both statutes have innocent owner

2

defenses.

3

punitive, not less.

If the Court has no further questions.
