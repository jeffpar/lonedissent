CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 17-647,

5

Knick versus the Township of Scott,

6

Pennsylvania.

7

Mr. Breemer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. DAVID BREEMER

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11
12

MR. BREEMER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Requiring Ms. Knick to prosecute her

13

federal takings claim in state court conflicts

14

with Section 1983 and is incompatible with the

15

nature of her claim.

16

the government's failure to compensate.

17

based on the township's failure to recognize

18

that the imposition of an access easement is a

19

Fifth Amendment taking that triggers a

20

compensation requirement.

21

Her claim is not based on
It's

Because lack of compensation is not an

22

element of her federal takings claim, state

23

compensation remedies do not bear on the

24

presentation of the claim in federal court.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

How is it not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

an element of her claim?

2

unless she is denied just compensation?

3

MR. BREEMER:

There's no violation

Well, Your Honor, in the

4

inverse condemnation context, the problem is

5

not that the government's violating the Just

6

Compensation Clause by failing to pay.

7

problem is that it's depriving her of her right

8

to just compensation because it does not

9

recognize that it's -- an invasion of her

10

property is a taking that triggers the

11

entitlement to compensation.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The

Well, I

13

thought that was the whole point of an inverse

14

condemnation.

15

money, and the whole point of the process,

16

which can be fairly elaborate, is that they're

17

just trying to figure out how much.

18

not enough, then she can bring a claim.

19

They recognize that they owe her

If it's

But it seems to me that it's imposing

20

a considerable burden on the state or the local

21

entities to say you've got to pay right away;

22

in other words, go through some sort of process

23

to figure out what you owe before you can even

24

-- you know, it's -- it's simply a process to

25

figure out how much is due.

I don't know why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

it's such a problem to make her go through that

2

in the initial instance.

3

MR. BREEMER:

To -- well, Your Honor,

4

it helps to remember that condemnation and

5

inverse condemnation takings are quite

6

different.

7

corresponds to what you were just describing,

8

the government condemns a property and then

9

it's just a process of -- of figuring out where

10
11

In a condemnation case, which

and how she's going to get her money.
But, when the question is whether

12

there is even a constitutional entitlement to

13

compensation, that before -­

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry.

Isn't

15

that what condemnation, whether it's regular or

16

inverse, does?

17

answers is, is there a taking?

18

reach the constitutional question.

19

-- in a regular condemnation -- condemnation

20

proceeding, they have to decide whether it -­

21

the government has a public interest or not.

22

That's what makes it constitutional.

23

don't understand.

24
25

The first question the court
So it does
Even in a

So I

Can I ask another question, however?
Assuming that you were right and that you had a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

federal cause of action or should have one

2

under 1983, when this case goes to a federal

3

court, why would a district court be -- abuse

4

its discretion for abstaining under any of the

5

three doctrines, Pullman, Louisiana Power &

6

Light, or Colorado River?

7

district courts can abstain when a legal issue

8

involves state law and that state law could

9

obviate the federal proceeding.

10

All of them say that

So one of two things can happen in the

11

state court below.

12

then there's no taking; or, second, there's a

13

taking, and the inverse condemnation proceeding

14

will provide the remedy.

15
16
17

They say no taking, and

So, in many ways, this obviates the
proceeding altogether.
MR. BREEMER:

Well, if I could -- Your

18

Honor, if I could answer the abstention

19

question first.

20

than any known abstention doctrine.

21

instance, in Quackenbush, this Court held

22

that -- a damages claim, that the federal court

23

couldn't abstain from a constitutional claim

24

for damages under Burford.

25

abstention doctrines deal when there's an

federal question -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

MR. BREEMER:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why isn't -­

-- but there isn't here.
-- why isn't that

6

the case here?

The whole issue is whether this

7

graveyard law is a -- was inherent in the

8

property she took, meaning that's what I

9

understood the legal question was.

It's all

10

about the state law rights of landowners

11

vis-a-vis cemeteries.

12

MR. BREEMER:

That, Your Honor, is the

13

township's defense.

14

The problem here, the question here is whether

15

Ms. Knick must go to the state court with her

16

federal claim.

the courthouse door.

18

we think -­

19

That's a merits defense.

She can't even get in through
That's the fundamental -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I guess my

20

bottom-line question is, if the abstention

21

doctrines apply, which I think they would -­

22

you've given me no reason why they shouldn't -­

23

aren't you just inviting now a patchwork of

24

federal and state involvement in cases?

25

Williamson has at least the advantage of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

clarifying where people go and how these claims

2

are adjudicated.

3

MR. BREEMER:

Well -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we have

5

abstention playing in, you're going to have a

6

patchwork of some state inverse condemnation

7

proceedings, some not, some courts taking

8

cases, others rightfully talking about

9

abstention.

10

MR. BREEMER:

Well, I think that's

11

actually, the situation you're describing, is

12

what is happening under Williamson County.

13

There's no predictable forum for adjudicating a

14

Fifth Amendment claim that there's a taking

15

that creates the entitlement to a compensation

16

remedy.

17

years have had no reasonable way to litigate

18

that federal question:

19

not a quest -- or not a taking?

20

Property owners like Ms. Knick for 30

Is there a taking or

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, why are you

21

claiming that the state courts in an inverse

22

condemnation proceeding are inadequate?

23

MR. BREEMER:

I'm not claiming that at

24

all.

State courts can deal with many

25

constitutional questions and they do.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

question here, though, is whether Ms. Knick

2

must go to a state court with her federal

3

takings claim to decide to get the town to

4

recognize that there is a taking within the

5

meaning of the Constitution that creates an

6

entitlement to compensation.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Breemer, may I get

8

back to this -- the question that you started

9

off with, which is when exactly the violation

10

occurs and why it occurs before the state

11

denies compensation in the inverse condemnation

12

proceeding, which is, I take it, what you're

13

saying.

14

Is that because -- are you saying that

15

that's because the right to compensation is

16

immediate; in other words, there's a right to

17

compensation contemporaneous with the taking?

18

Is that what your claim is?

19

MR. BREEMER:

The -- not exactly.

20

There is -- there is a right to compensation as

21

soon as there's a determined that there's -- a

22

determination that there's a taking in the

23

inverse condemnation context.

24

we're talking about is an invasion of property.

25

Remember, what

The township, which has the power of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

eminent domain, doesn't use the power of

2

eminent domain to take that easement.

3

used its regulatory powers.

4

It just

So there's no entitlement to

5

compensation until the property owner,

6

Ms. Knick, goes in and gets a determination

7

that's a taking.

8

issues -­

9

After that, compensation

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And then -­

Okay -­
-- and then what

12

happens?

13

the preliminary question, is there a taking,

14

you can bring in federal court.

15

Then suppose you're right and the -­

Then -- and if the answer to that is

16

yes, then the whole inverse condemnation

17

proceeding goes forward in -- in federal court

18

with -­

19

MR. BREEMER:

I understand your -­

20

your question, Your Honor.

Once a takings

21

determination is made, then a federal court

22

would hold a -- a damages proceeding, just like

23

it does in other Section 1983 contexts,

24

unreasonable seizure, due process deprivations.

25

And it -- it would be easier in a takings

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

context than those other contexts because

2

damages for a taking is simply just

3

compensation.

4

So a federal court -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But how would this

5

-- and that's what -- that's what inverse

6

condemn -- condemnation is as well.

7

-- how does step 2 -- step 1, is there a

8

taking?

9

federal court.

Yes.

So how do

Something else happens in

10

How would -- does that something else

11

differ from an inverse condemnation proceeding

12

in state court?

13

MR. BREEMER:

It -- it doesn't.

It's

14

-- it's dual -- the inverse condemnation

15

rights.

16

English incorporates a right of inverse

17

condemnation under the federal Constitution.

18

The Fifth Amendment under First

The states have also inverse

19

condemnation procedures, but, again, the

20

question is when you have a federal claim, when

21

your claim is that the takings provision in the

22

Fifth Amendment is violated -- excuse me, not

23

violated, when it's implicated so that there's

24

a just compensation remedy, do you have to go

25

use a state inverse condemnation instead of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

Fifth Amendment's inverse condemnation

2

procedure that's recognized as self-executing.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But usually -­

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me see if I

5

understand your claim, because a little -- some

6

of the questions and the discussion up to this

7

point is a bit confusing to me.

8
9

I thought your claim was that there is
a violation of the takings clause and you can,

10

therefore, bring a suit under 1983 when the

11

state does something that constitutes a taking

12

but at the same time says we're not paying you

13

anything for this.

14

Now it's not a question of when they

15

would have to pay once they've admitted that

16

there's a taking, but when they do something

17

that constitutes a taking, and they say, no,

18

this isn't a taking at all, and, therefore,

19

you're getting zero, which I understand to be

20

your claim here, then you can go directly to

21

federal court and bring an action under 1983.

22

And to require you to go to state

23

court before you do that is essentially to

24

require you to exhaust state remedies before

25

you can bring a 1983 claim, which is never

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

required under 1983.

2

your argument.

3

I thought that that was

MR. BREEMER:

Right.

And that is one

4

of our arguments, is that when the government,

5

the township here in this case, invades

6

property without -- without condemning it, it's

7

clear that it's not compensating and that your

8

claim accrues at that -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how is it clear

10

that it's not compensating?

11

what Justice Alito says clarifies matters

12

considerably, that if the state has already

13

said we're not compensating, then it seems you

14

can claim both that you've had a taking and

15

that the state has refused to compensate.

16

In other words,

But I thought that the question here

17

arose from the fact that the state has not said

18

yet that it's not compensating, that, instead,

19

it uses the inverse condemnation proceeding to

20

make that determination.

21

MR. BREEMER:

Is that wrong?

Well, yes, in -- in this

22

way:

The township is taking her property.

23

township has imposed an easement on Ms. Knick's

24

property that allows the public in every day of

25

the week, every day of the year.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

It has the power to condemn easements.

2

It did not use it.

3

township is not compensating her.

4

that there's even a taking.

5

matter of what the state does.

6

of what the township, as the -- as the

7

defendant that's taking your property, and

8

could have used condemnation and declared a

9

taking, gone into state court, kept it there,

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

So it's not a
It's a matter

And the township has

-­

13
14

It denies

but instead used its regulatory power.

11
12

So we know that the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about the town

-­

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- the township has

16

imposed these restrictions on the property and

17

it hasn't said that it will pay anything for

18

it.

19

us in state court and you win in an inverse -­

20

inverse condemnation proceeding which we will

21

resist, we will refuse to pay the judgment of

22

the state court.

23

has -- it certainly has not said we admit that

24

this is a taking and we owe you money, and

25

there -- and you have to go to state court to

Of course, it hasn't said that if you sue

It hasn't said that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But it

determine how much money we owe.

2

that?

3

MR. BREEMER:

Am I right on

That's right.

And -­

4

and the entitle -- that's -- the issue is the

5

entitlement.

6

an entitlement to compensation.

7

The township denies that there's

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Ms. -­

But does it?

I mean,

8

I -- I'm following Justice Alito's point

9

exactly, except what I'm not understanding is I

10

-- I had thought that in a case like this there

11

had been no determination by the state that

12

there was liability one way or the other.

13

other words, the state had not denied

14

liability, nor had the state conceded

15

liability.

16

In

So this isn't a -- a question where

17

the state has said:

18

liability.

19

said one way or the other.

20

find out in the inverse condemnation action

21

whether the state is, in fact, denying all

22

liability or whether the state is going to come

23

in and say:

24

here, and now let's talk about how much.

25

Look, we deny any

It's -- it's -- the state hasn't
And we're going to

You're right, there is liability

MR. BREEMER:

Well, we -- we could,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

but, again, that liability issue arises under

2

the Fifth Amendment under the takings

3

provision.

4

deciding that very question, is there liability

5

or not?

6

So a federal court is capable of

If there is, there's a compensation

7

remedy ensuring that a de facto taking does not

8

go without compensation if there is, which -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

But my

10

question is, if the state has not denied

11

liability yet, how do you have a Fifth

12

Amendment claim?

13

liability, if it has said we're refusing to

14

pay, then I take Justice Alito's point exactly.

15

Then you have both your elements of the Fifth

16

Amendment claim.

17

state has refused to pay just compensation,

18

allegedly.

19

If the state has denied

There's been a taking and the

But, if the state has not yet refused

20

to pay, how do you have a Fifth Amendment

21

claim?

22

MR. BREEMER:

Because in the inverse

23

condemnation context -- well, let me back up

24

one minute.

25

I think the appropriate actor is the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

township, but in the inverse condemnation

2

context, again, the problem is not whether or

3

not the government will pay.

4

recognize an entitlement because there's been a

5

taking.

6

It's will it

Until you get that entitle -- that

7

takings determination made, compensation issues

8

don't play into the equation.

9

compensation issues aren't part of the element

And if

10

of the takings dispute, then state remedies are

11

irrelevant to the presentation of claims.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But this isn't

13

-- this isn't sort of a black or white thing.

14

I assume what the state -- well, I thought what

15

the state had done and will do in -- in many

16

cases is say, look, we don't think we owe you

17

anything, but we have a process for determining

18

whether we do or not.

19

out under the inverse condemnation action we

20

do, well, that's what we'll pay.

21

is that what is going on here?

22

MR. BREEMER:

And if -- if it turns

Is -- is -­

Well, again, Your Honor,

23

I would say this, that the fact that there are

24

state procedures like inverse condemnation

25

doesn't mean that they must be used for a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

federal claim.

That's the question here:

Must

2

Ms. Knick use the state inverse condemnation

3

remedies rather than the federal remedy that's

4

under the Fifth Amendment.

5

would say no, the language and purpose of

6

Section 1983 says no.

7

and purpose of Section 1331 says no.

And Section 1983

The history and language

8

So what we're asking -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In this case -- in

10

this case, I think the first -- first question

11

was, should the Court overrule Williamson.

12

Are you asking the Court to do that,

13

or are you distinguishing the claim that you're

14

making from the claim in Williamson?

15

MR. BREEMER:

We're -- we are asking,

16

Your Honor, for the Court to overrule

17

Williamson County to this -- to this extent,

18

the state compensation requirement, because it

19

is inconsistent with Section 1983 and with the

20

nature of a Fifth Amendment inverse

21

condemnation claim.

22

But, again, we're not asking the Court

23

to overrule the entirety of Williamson County.

24

The finality ripeness prong, which is still a

25

difficult hurdle to get by, would remain intact

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

and would keep many claims -- would -- would

2

stop many claims at an early stage.

3

we're asking the Court to return -­

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so

Would that mean

5

that if the state or the locality says once we

6

have an administrative law, if you disagree

7

with it, you have to go through this

8

administrative process and, if we violated

9

something, we'll pay for it?

10

Would that be

okay?

11

MR. BREEMER:

No, Your Honor, it would

12

not, for two reasons, and then I'd like to

13

reserve the rest of my time.

14

the same res judicata and issue preclusion

15

problems that Williamson County already

16

generates because administrative procedures in

17

Pennsylvania and many places elsewhere are res

18

judicata and issue preclusion in court.

That would raise

19

And, secondly, as this Court -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So -- but wait a

21

minute.

22

law, it says at the bottom of the law we don't

23

think this is a condemnation, but, if it is,

24

follow this administrative process.

25

What you're saying is a state passes a

So it's basically saying we'll pay you

There's a dispute as to whether it -- you took

not.

this law is right or not, that you don't have

20

to exhaust that administrative process?

21

MR. BREEMER:

No, you wouldn't have

to prove a taking at an administrative level.

These cases, takings

ORAL ARGUMENT OF NOEL J. FRANCISCO

20

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

21
22
23
24
25

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may -- may it please the Court:
I'd like to address two basic points
that I think are relevant to the discussion

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

that we've been having here.

2

First, Williamson County's premise was

3

correct.

The government doesn't violate the

4

takings clause if it provides just compensation

5

after the fact.

6

Section 1983 is only available to address

7

constitutional violations.

8

available to enforce the deprivation of all

9

constitutional rights, and there's no basis for

But it erred in assuming that

Instead, it's

10

concluding that the right to just compensation

11

is the only right that Section 1983 doesn't

12

cover.

13

But, second, I think you can

14

effectively reach the same result under Section

15

1331 because, as this Court held in

16

International College of Surgeons, is -- if a

17

state cause of action asserts a federal takings

18

claim as such, then that state cause of action

19

arises under the Constitution for purposes of

20

Section 1331, and so the property owner falls

21

within the district court's original

22

jurisdiction, and you don't have to address

23

whether Williamson County was rightly or

24

wrongly decided at all.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Has that ever been

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

considered before?

2

out of this difficulty.

3

addressed it?

4

Because it seems a -- a way
Has anybody ever

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, I

5

think the only thing that I can point you to is

6

International College of Surgeons itself, but,

7

no, no court has addressed it in the context of

8

Williamson County.

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you -­

But -­
-- you can

12

answer the letters that we're going to get from

13

district court judges around the country who

14

are not going to be very happy learning that

15

they now have to adjudicate state inverse

16

condemnation actions, which can be fairly

17

elaborate.

18

You know, the judge appoints a special

19

master.

20

you know, it's like arbitration.

21

a very intensive procedure that seems more

22

suited for state court than federal court.

23

They go out and evaluate it.

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

It's -­

It's -- it's

Well, Your Honor,

24

I -- I think the Court crossed that bridge in

25

International College of Surgeons when it -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

really in a factually analogous case.

2

case, Illinois's landmarks law applied to

3

buildings owned by the International College of

4

Surgeons, and they asserted in a state cause of

5

action that the application of that law

6

constituted a federal taking.

7

held that it was within federal jurisdiction.

8
9

In that

And this Court

I agree that there are going to be
Erie issues that courts are going to have to

10

confront, but I don't think they'd be

11

particularly problematic.

12

affirmative condemnation proceedings, state

13

eminent domain proceedings that are brought in

14

federal court because of diversity

15

jurisdiction.

16

Take, for example,

The federal rules, Federal Rule

17

71.1(k), I think it is, already provide for

18

federal courts to apply the state procedural

19

rules for assessing the amount of compensation

20

in that context.

21

So, yes, they will have to confront

22

those types of state law questions, but I don't

23

think it would be particularly problematic.

24

It's something that courts do in diversity

25

cases all the time, and in cases -- other cases

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

that raise federal questions all the time,

2

like -­

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

General, my -- my

4

question is I can see his point, that you could

5

say a state that says our regulation doesn't

6

take anything, and they dispute it.

7

could say a state that acts that way is a state

8

that isn't going to pay you any money and,

9

therefore, it is complete, the violation.

And you

Or

10

you could say we don't know about the second

11

answer yet, so we'll see.

12

sometimes the one, sometimes the other.

Or you could say

13

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

Or we could go into

15

1331.

But Williamson was decided 32 years ago.

16

This is a very complicated area of law.

17

not let sleeping dogs lie?

18

decisis.

Why

It's called stare

19

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

And, Your Honor -­

There is one harm,

21

the harm of the person who tries to remove and

22

then gets kicked out of court.

23

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Right.

We could write a

sentence saying that's wrong, you've waived it.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

All right.

2

briefs any serious harm that would, in fact -­

3

your 1331 point can be tried out by somebody -­

4

but any serious point that right now provides a

5

strong reason for overturning a case that's

6

been on the books in a complex area for 32

7

years.

8
9

But I couldn't find in any of these

GENERAL FRANCISCO:
responses, Your Honor.

So a couple of

I think our 1331

10

argument doesn't require you to overturn

11

Williamson County.

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

14

I think it exists

very nicely alongside of Williamson County.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

16

below.

17

raised below.

18

It doesn't.

It wasn't raised

Thirteen -- the 1331 theory was not

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

No, Your Honor,

19

but we think it is well within the question

20

presented.

21
22
23

The Court -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Was it raised by

the parties?
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

That's correct,

24

Your Honor, but I think it's well within the

25

question presented because this Court granted

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

certiorari on whether or not to overrule

2

Williamson County.

3

Williamson County is that it closes the federal

4

courthouse doors to an entire category of

5

takings litigants.

6

alternative argument is directly relevant to

7

whether Williamson County does, in fact, close

8

the federal courthouse doors to an entire

9

category of takings litigants.

10

The principal criticism of

And I think that our

I'd also note that Williamson County

11

itself -- the parties below didn't raise the

12

issue that we are here talking about before the

13

Court.

14

So I think -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

But this is a theory

15

-- a pretty -- there's no reason in history

16

that federal courts have to be open to every

17

federal claim.

18

Sometimes they're not.

I mean, sometimes they are.

19

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

That's -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

courts can litigate too.

22

do it?

23

for 32 years, end of this case, stare decisis,

24

solicitor general raises a very interesting

25

point, not litigated here.

So, therefore, state
Okay.

So -- so why

My question is, why not simply say, law

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

3

happens.

4

Right.

We'll see what

If it's -­
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, look, I'll

5

put my 1331 argument to the side because I

6

think, as -- as I've -- I've explained, that

7

exists alongside Williamson County.

8

take on your question directly, why should the

9

Court consider overturning Williamson County?

10

But let me

And we think that the principal

11

reason, if you decide to get there, and we

12

don't think you have to decide to get there,

13

but if you decide to get there, it's because

14

Williamson County's rationale has never

15

actually been explained.

16

And as a result, it has been

17

understood by the lower courts to produce this

18

unintended consequence of essentially closing

19

the courthouse -- federal courthouse doors to a

20

class of takings litigants.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We -­
I'm sorry, the

22

courthouse doors are closed to people on tax

23

issues, even though there's constitutional

24

claims.

25

for -- for doctrinal reasons and -- and comity

So there's a class that we have both

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

issues and a lot of other reasons, we've closed

2

the courthouse doors.

3

We've closed them to people claiming

4

that they had an unreasonable search and

5

seizure.

6

under the Fourth Amendment, a claim in state

7

court, they can't come to federal court

8

afterwards.

9

If they litigated in state court

So it's not as if our courthouse doors

10

are open uniformly to everybody anytime.

11

There -- there are all sorts of doctrines that

12

preclude people -­

13

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- from coming to

15

federal court once they've been issue-precluded

16

in state court.

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

And that's

18

the key, I think, once they've been

19

issue-precluded in state court.

20

doctrines, with the exception of the tax

21

doctrine, which I'll address in a moment,

22

actually close the federal courthouse doors

23

when there's not a pending state court

24

proceeding, because I think the criminal cases

25

you're talking about are the Younger doctrine.

None of those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

When it comes to the tax laws, that's

2

a very tax-specific rule -- rule that doesn't

3

just apply to property claims; it applies

4

across the board and bars any constitutional

5

challenge in federal courts to state or local

6

tax laws.

7

applies across the board to property claims.

There's no comparable rule that

8

After all, courts -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, except

10

Williamson, which basically says there's no

11

taking.

12

encouraging us to believe that compensation is

13

due the minute there's a taking, is it?

And you don't -- you're not

14

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

We don't think -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That it has to be

16

-- happen before the taking?

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

We certainly don't

18

think you violate the clause if you provide

19

compensation after the taking.

20

directly to your question, under the First

21

Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment, courts

22

regularly entertain challenges to state

23

property laws.

24

Cleburne or City of Renton against Playtime

25

Theatres.

But, to go

Think of cases like City of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

There's no general rule that bars all

2

federal claims, all claims in federal court to

3

state and local property laws, other than

4

Williamson County, I agree.

5

that there's any basis for treating the takings

6

clause any differently than the other parts of

7

the Constitution.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I don't think

General, I assume we

wouldn't have a problem here if we didn't have

10

preclusive effect of the state action.

11

correct in your view?

Is that

12

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

13

don't think it is correct in my view.

14

that highlights one of the unintended

15

consequences of Williamson County, but we

16

believe that, properly construed, Section 1983

17

was meant to provide a remedy for the

18

deprivation of all constitutional rights,

19

including the right to just compensation.

20

Your Honor, no, I
I think

And that's a right that vests the

21

moment the property is taken.

You don't

22

violate it if you pay after the fact, but the

23

right, in fact, vests the moment the property

24

is taken, which is why you're actually entitled

25

to interest from the moment of the taking until

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

you get paid.

2

So, under Section 1983, we think quite

3

literally that a property owner is being

4

deprived of the right to just compensation at

5

the moment the government engages in the lawful

6

act of taking their property without payment.

7

That's why we think that the error in

8

Williamson County was the -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

General, I -- you

10

know, I read those pages in your brief a couple

11

of times, and I have -- I have to say that

12

they're -- it's just going over my head a

13

little bit, how it is that you can say that

14

there's a deprivation of a right when you

15

simultaneously say that there's been no

16

violation -­

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

-- even though the

19

government hasn't paid yet.

20

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

And for

21

most constitutional provisions, there's no

22

difference.

23

don't deprive somebody of their free speech

24

rights unless you violate their free speech

25

rights.

So, under the First Amendment, you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

But the takings clause is meaningfully

2

different because the right to just

3

compensation vests only when the government

4

acts lawfully.

5

government's lawful action in taking your

6

property that your right to just compensation

7

vests, which is why you get interest.

8

just finish up.

9

It's at the moment of the

And I'll

And so we think that, quite literally,

10

the property owner is deprived of their right

11

to just compensation from the moment the

12

government acts lawfully to take their property

13

until the property owner is paid.

MS. SACHS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The reinterpretations proposed here as

to both Section 1983 and also what we've heard

Court held in Williamson County was that a

claimant can't come to federal court under

8

Section 1983 claiming that their constitutional

right to just compensation has been violated,

What this

10

when the state provides a reasonable, certain,

11

and adequate means to obtain just compensation,

12

and Petitioner -­

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think

14

it was clear in Williamson County, because they

15

used terms of ripeness and -- and -- and the

16

like that I don't think the court contemplated

17

the later decision in San Remo, that by sending

18

it to state court, they were effectively taking

19

the federal courts out of the whole business of

20

adjudicating these claims because of the

21

preclusive effect of the state -- state remedy.

22

MS. SACHS:

Well, first of all, Your

23

Honor, if I may, the -- the court did use terms

24

like ripeness, and at that time, ripeness

25

perhaps was not as closely associated with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35

jurisdictional considerations as it is today.

2

It was not a jurisdictional decision

3

and that the court could certainly clarify that

4

Williamson County was not jurisdictional.

5

Williamson County, an element of the Section

1983 cause of action was missing, for the same

reason in this case.

rights to just compensation had been violated.

In

The only claim raised was

And yet we know from 130 years of this

violation of the just compensation clause if

that reasonable, certain, and adequate

provision exists at the time of the taking.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I think what the

18

agree -- you agree that the compensation that

is due runs from the moment of the taking?

other words, if it takes you six months to

adjudicate the -- the claim and you say, well,

22

this is how much you owe, you owe interest

going all the way back to the point at which

24

the property was taken, correct?

MS. SACHS:

In

Well, yes, this Court has

And it must be

time to pursue the inverse condemnation action,

of a constitutional right in the interim.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it turns

11

out there was a violation of the constitutional

12

right at the moment of the taking, right?

13

That's the whole point of interest.

14

MS. SACHS:

No.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Why, if there

hasn't been a violation, why do you owe

MS. SACHS:

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

That just -­
-- from the

moment of the taking?
MS. SACHS:

-- because it's a -- the

22

-- the post-deprivation process has been

24

in other situations, because there -- this is a

circumstance, particularly a regulatory

position of the township be?

In this particular case, I

think the township would say there has been no

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Therefore, if you have

18

taken her property, you have taken her property

19

and you have denied her compensation.

20

that not a violation of the takings clause?

is a taking without compensation.

22
23
24
25

MS. SACHS:

Why is
It

Because we do not agree

that we have taken anything, Your Honor.
JUSTICE ALITO:
That's a merits issue.

Well, that's fine.
That can be decided in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

a 1983 action.

2

MS. SACHS:

But, under 1983, there is

3

no violation.

4

is what Section 1983 protects.

5

because the Fifth Amendment provides the right

6

to compensation, and the Fourteenth Amendment

7

prohibits a state from denying that right, we

8

have not denied that right.

9

Her right to just compensation

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And, of course,

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, I -- I -­
Can I go back -­
-- I think this gets

12

back to Justice Breyer's question a little bit,

13

which is you could say that the violation is

14

complete upon the taking of the property with

15

the denial of compensation, as Justice Alito

16

just alluded to, and you've just denied that

17

any compensation is due.

18

Or you could say it should wait until

19

a state litigation process has exhausted

20

itself.

21

the state has acknowledged a duty to pay, and

22

we can say the state's probably good for it.

23

And that's where those cases originally came

24

from, Cherokee and some of the early ones.

25

And maybe it makes sense to wait when

But maybe -- maybe it doesn't make

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

sense when the state has denied any obligation

2

to pay.

3

different when it's an inverse condemnation,

4

because when we look at other -- other

5

constitutional rights, we don't say that a

6

First Amendment violation isn't complete until

7

someone has litigated that claim in state court

8

under state processes or a Fourth Amendment

9

claim.

10

Maybe -- maybe it makes -- maybe it is

And when you look at the history of

11

inverse condemnation suits, they originated in

12

common law under trespass.

13

against the state for trespass.

14

inverse condemnation suit is.

15

nothing less.

16

It's a simple claim
That's what an
Nothing more,

So why should we single out the -­

17

this particular right, the takings clause, for

18

such disfavored treatment to wait to exhaust

19

state remedies that wind up in this ripeness

20

world to yield a moot federal claim?

21

MS. SACHS:

22

to that question, Your Honor.

23

A -- a couple of answers

Number one, we are not giving

24

disfavored treatment to property rights.

25

Constitution does not protect the right to hold

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

onto your property when the government has a

2

just reason to take it.

3

And the -- what the Constitution

4

protects is the right to get just compensation

5

for that.

6

has specifically said inverse condemnation is

7

an appropriate form of -- of providing that

8

reasonable, certain, and adequate compensation.

9
10

And this Court since, I think, 1895,

But we could say the

Fourth Amendment claim or a First Amendment

14

claim.

15

out there, every bit as good as any federal

16

judge.

17

claims that are available equivalent to the

18

trespass claim of an inverse condemnation suit.

19

There are a lot of great state judges

And there are a lot of state tort

Why don't we wait to see how they

20

adjudicate a Fourth Amendment violation by a

21

police officer who's engaged in excessive

22

force?

23

prosecutor's engaged in malicious prosecution?

24

We don't because 1983 says you don't have to

25

wait.

Why don't we wait for -- when the

Why not here?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

MS. SACHS:

Actually, with malicious

2

prosecution, Your Honor, we do.

And that's one

3

example of times when we do require litigants

4

to have -- have completed their state process.

5

And here, that -- we are not suggesting that

6

there isn't a right to seek compensation.

7

The question is, has Congress created

8

a basis in federal court to seek compensation?

9

The suggestion that this is a federal takings

10

claim is not where this claim -- case -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

12

MS. SACHS:

13
14

Well, Ms. -­

-- started or where

Williamson County started.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- Ms. Sachs, I -- I

15

think you have a pretty good argument that

16

there's no Fifth Amendment violation until both

17

the taking has been accomplished and there's

18

been a denial of just compensation.

19

both of those things happen, there's no claim.

20

But I think the problem is -- and the

21

Chief Justice referred to this -- the way that

22

rule combines with the preclusion principles in

23

such a way that it prevents somebody from

24

getting into federal court at all.

25

words, does -- and I don't think Williams

And until

In other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

really understood that this would happen, that

2

saying, well, look, you have to go through the

3

state process for determining just compensation

4

before you can bring a federal claim, I don't

5

think Williams understood that the result of

6

going through the state process for determining

7

just compensation was that you were never going

8

to be able to bring a Fifth Amendment claim.

9

And -- and that seems to me an issue

10

and one that I'm trying to find my way around.

11

And I'm wondering whether there is one.

12

MS. SACHS:

Well, I think, when you go

13

back and look at Williamson County, Williamson

14

County was, again, in terms of a 1983 cause of

15

action, whether there had been a violation.

16

we're talking about establishing whether there

17

has been a violation.

18

So

And with respect to the -- the full

19

faith and credit aspect, in Williamson County,

20

the -- the Court specifically cites the Migra

21

case, which the Court had decided one year

22

earlier and which specifically turned on

23

exactly that point, that adjudication -­

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

You don't have to -­

the problem -- the problem -- I mean, you could

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

say what Justice Gorsuch said, couldn't you?

2

The state says:

3

you.

4

there's no taking.

No, we're not going to pay

5

Ha, because there's no compensation -­
Ha.

And we could say that's a final

6

decision not to take it.

7

don't see any logic.

8

So I thought:

9

dog -- let it lie?

We could.

I mean, I

But Williamson didn't.

Well, why let the sleeping
And -- and then one thing,

10

however, they have a good point and what do you

11

think of that?

12

no reason for the defendant in the state case,

13

where you can do so, remove it to federal

14

court, and then, once he's in federal court,

15

they won't decide it because it wasn't in state

16

court.

17

Their point is there's surely

You agree that we should -- no matter

18

what we do, we should write a sentence which

19

says that's wrong?

20

MS. SACHS:

Yes, Your Honor.

And -­

21

and to -- to put that in context, I think of

22

all of the cases that have been raised as

23

supposedly illustrating this dramatic problem

24

created by Williamson County, there were only

25

three situations that we could identify where

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

an actual takings -- an actual inverse

2

condemnation claim had been pursued properly in

3

state court and then was dismissed when it was

4

removed.

5

And we agree, no one advocates for -­

6

for not having property owners have their

7

appropriate day in court.

JUSTICE BREYER:
How does it work?

How does it work?

I just -- I should know

10

this, but I don't.

12

To do that in the city, you have to have a

14

they say we do not want you to demonstrate in

15

16

A group of people would

They go to the city authorities.

And

Can the person who wants to

demonstrate then and there bring a suit in

federal court and -- saying that violates my

First Amendment right?

MS. SACHS:

Well, if -- if that is a

JUSTICE BREYER:

MS. SACHS:

that that might be an example of one of the

many situations where the -- the -- the state

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So, under our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48

cases in Gunn and -- I forget whether it's

logic suggests there would be a federal cause

We would disagree with

unfair.

There's a bunch of different words.

MS. SACHS:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Justice

Ginsburg.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- City of Chicago,

when you -- you were in the middle of saying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

something about City of Chicago, which the -­

2

the solicitor general relies on for the 1331

3

argument.

4

that, the relevance of City of Chicago?

5

Could you complete your answer to

MS. SACHS:

Absolutely, Justice

6

Ginsburg.

The reason that we -- we wanted to

7

point out City of Chicago is that City of

8

Chicago is another example, I think, of what

9

Justice Sotomayor was just talking about:

a

10

case that belonged in federal court from the

11

start or could have been filed in federal court

12

from the start, because, when you look at the

13

actual complaint, a notice of removal, which we

14

actually got from the federal court archives

15

for that purpose, they were all federal facial

16

claims that could have been brought in federal

17

court in the first place.

18

There was no claim for compensation

19

that was removed.

20

the reason the Court referenced, I think,

21

Section 1331 jurisdiction was because the Court

22

made a point of saying every issue raised by

23

the plaintiff in that case was a substantial

24

federal issue.

25

The issue in that case and

And so that was a case that was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

properly in federal court.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

3

MS. SACHS:

5

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?
Because I dissented

in City of Chicago.

7

(Laughter.)

8

MS. SACHS:

9

Well, that's not

100 percent clear.

4

6

And those cases -­

And -- and I -- I -- I

remember that, Your Honor, because of the cross

10

-- the cross sort of jurisdictional appeal

11

issue, which was really, I think, what was a

12

big issue in that case, not whether there

13

weren't claims that couldn't have been brought

14

in federal court to start with.

15

that's -­

16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

20

One of the

problems -­

18
19

And I think

MS. SACHS:

-- what it's been cited

for here.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- one of the

21

problems with requiring takings plaintiffs to

22

go to state court is that the inverse

23

condemnation procedures can be very elaborate,

24

can be very expensive, requiring the hiring of

25

experts and economic analyses and all that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

And somebody with a legitimate takings claim,

2

forced to go through the state procedures, as a

3

practical matter may not be able to defend

4

their -- their rights.

5

MS. SACHS:

Well, that is certainly

6

not the case in Pennsylvania, Your Honor, which

7

is what I can speak to.

8

not only is very comprehensive, it provides for

9

expert review, it provides for more relief -­

10

Pennsylvania's process

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, okay -­

11

well, I -- I assume it's not necessarily the

12

case in every other state.

13

do in a situation where -- where that's the -­

14

the case, that the -- the procedure is very

15

expensive and requiring someone to go through

16

it will discourage people with legitimate

17

federal claims from going forward with them?

18

MS. SACHS:

So what would you

Again, nobody advocates

19

for a position that would not allow owners to

20

go to court.

21

sounds like it could be a Section 1983 claim

22

because there's been a denial of a means to

23

provide just compensation.

24
25

But what Your Honor is positing

If the process is so byzantine or long
or complicated that it -- it doesn't represent

Heritage Reporting Corporation

that reasonable, certain, adequate component,

2

that constitutionality demands.

Yes, I think there are,

And I -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

In what way are states

10

and their subdivisions in a different position

11

today than they were on the eve of the decision

12

in Williamson County?

13

MS. SACHS:

Well, I think the

14

Williamson County, and just if I may put a bit

15

of context to that question, because there's

16

been so much focus on Williamson County,

17

Williamson County was actually not so much the

18

sea change in this area as Monell, because

19

Monell was where this Court first said you can

20

make a Section 1983 claim against a

21

municipality.

22

That was just seven years before

23

Williamson County.

And the Court said we're

24

not establishing the contours of -- of what

25

liability against township -- municipalities

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

will look like.

2

So the amount of Section 1983

3

litigation really arose after Monell and -- and

4

-- and came to this Court in Williamson County.

5

But to answer then the question of -- of the

6

difference between then and now, before and

7

after Williamson County, states have used

8

eminent domain and inverse condemnation

9

proceedings to be sure that they're providing

10

the appropriate compensation for any regulatory

11

taking that might be deemed to occur.

12

And, of course, they've continued to

13

-- to do that and to enact statutes in

14

reliance, and regulations, in reliance upon the

15

fact that -­

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what have they done

17

-- what have they done in reliance on their

18

understanding that they can't be required to go

19

directly to federal court in a case like this?

20

MS. SACHS:

Well, I -- I -- I think

21

that they've relied on the existence of their

22

processes as providing the compensation that is

23

required for any taking so that they don't have

24

to determine that in some fashion in advance.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

What -- so what would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57

they have done differently if that rule had

2

never been adopted?

3

MS. SACHS:

If -- if Williamson County

had come out differently?
JUSTICE ALITO:

MS. SACHS:

Yeah.

I -­
What would they have

done differently as a result of Williamson

MS. SACHS:

It's -- it's -- well, I

12

think depending upon the basis for -- for

13

undoing Williamson County, if this Court were

14

to say that you have to make payment in

15

advance, I think that would affect counties and

16

municipalities all over the country

17

tremendously because it would require the

18

rewriting of every eminent domain code out

19

there and it would require every statute,

20

presumably, or regulation or ordinance to

21

somehow be -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but, counsel,

25

regime in either case, a suit in federal court

We're just talking about a remedial

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

or a suit in state court.

2

And I would have thought presumably

3

the answer would be that the state's conduct

4

would be the same in either circumstance.

5

You'd be prepared to pay just compensation for

6

takings, and prepared not to pay just

7

compensation where there is no taking, and it

8

wouldn't matter whether the claim's in federal

9

court or state court.

10

MS. SACHS:

Isn't that right?
If -- if -- if -- if

11

that's the question and then I misunderstood

12

Justice Alito's question, and I apologize, but

13

I thought when you were talking about

14

overruling Williamson County, you were thinking

15

of one of the arguments that we've heard here

16

today, which is that perhaps it's always

17

unconstitutional if taking isn't made at the

18

time of inverse -­

What -- what other factors under stare

MS. SACHS:

The fact that it was

correct from the outset, Your Honor, and the

10

fact that this is an area where one of the

11

factors for stare decisis is whether the

12

Court's recent decisions are consistent or

13

inconsistent with any steps Congress may have

14

taken recently.

15

Now some -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we overruled

16

it, would that undermine other decisions of

17

ours?

18

MS. SACHS:

Well, Your Honor, there

19

isn't a whole web of -- of precedents from this

20

Court, both on the full faith and credit issue,

21

but, obviously, that would be minimized, but

22

things like Del Monte Dunes, where the Court

23

specifically said, again, and I think in the

24

1983 context, that there is no -- that you need

25

that element of denial.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know if

you've come across this anywhere, but -­

3

MS. SACHS:

I'm sorry, Your Honor?

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I don't know if

5

you've come across this in stare decisis cases,

6

but I think a factor that moves me -- maybe it

7

shouldn't -- is it's a technical area of law,

8

two generations at least of lawyers have grown

9

up knowing this is how you proceed, that if you

10

change it, suddenly there will be new lines

11

that have to be drawn, which are the complete

12

refusals, which are the not refusals, but we -­

13

which are the partial refusals, and maybe it

14

will be a boon to law schools that have courses

15

to catch property lawyers up on what's going

16

on.

Now is that sort of thing relevant to
stare decisis?

jurisprudence, to trust the courts to say that

22

we trust the state courts to resolve these

issues and to know that, especially in property

rights cases, where stare decisis has

25

particular force because people do rely upon

what they know about property rights, and -­

2

and this Court has called that particular area

3

sort of a super-specialized type of stare

5

justification -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MS. SACHS:

8

that doesn't exist.

9

Ms. Sachs?

-- for overruling it.

And

I'm sorry?

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I probably should know

10

the answer to this question, but if -- if

11

Pennsylvania, instead of using an inverse

12

condemnation procedure, used a strictly

13

administrative process so it didn't go to the

14

courts, it was just some kind of administrative

15

body, would that have the same kind of

16

preclusive effect as a state court judgment

17

does?

18

MS. SACHS:

I think it would not have

19

the same type of preclusive effect in an

20

administrative proceeding.

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So that -­
Can you go over, I

22

think, what -- you said that there's an element

23

missing, this is not a 1983 claim because

24

there's an element of such a claim that's

25

missing.

What is the element that's missing?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

MS. SACHS:

I think the element that

2

is missing, Justice Ginsburg, is the denial or

3

the -- the deprivation of a constitutional

4

right.

5

constitutional right because the right that

6

this Court has said is protected is the right

7

to get just compensation, that that can happen

8

afterwards as long as that reasonable, certain,

9

adequate provision exists.

10

There has been no deprivation of a

it is missing an element.

about the length of -- of what could happen.

23

That's not the situation in Pennsylvania.

MS. SACHS:

Your Honor, there's

nothing to suggest, and Petitioners have not

suggested, that the Pennsylvania process is any

more long or burdensome or expensive than any
