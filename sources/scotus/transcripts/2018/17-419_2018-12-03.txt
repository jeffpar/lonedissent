(10:10 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 17-419,

5

Dawson versus Steager.

6

Mr. Rosenberg.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE D. ROSENBERG

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10
11

MR. ROSENBERG:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The State's exemption violates Section

12

111 and this Court's precedents because it

13

facially discriminates based on the source of

14

the compensation, as only retirement benefits

15

from state retirement plans are exempted, and

16

the State cannot show any significant

17

differences between retired employees of the

18

U.S. Marshals Service and the exempted state

19

retirees because the State concedes that their

20

job duties are the same.

21

This Court should reverse.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

What do we do with

23

the fact that the job duties of marshals

24

overlap with the two categories of the state?

25

They overlap with the people paying less tax

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

and with other law enforcement agents who pay

2

more tax.

3

So how do we go about identifying -­

4

MR. ROSENBERG:

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6
7

So -­
-- who they're

most similar to?
MR. ROSENBERG:

-- two responses,

8

Justice Sotomayor.

The first is the inquiry

9

isn't who they're most similar to.

Under

10

Davis, so long as the plaintiffs here, the U.S.

11

Marshals, are similar to the exempted state

12

employees, that's enough.

13

That's because Section 111 provides an

14

individual right against discrimination for

15

federal employees.

16

case, for example, if there really were

17

identical state employees, some who were

18

exempted and some who weren't, that case would

19

go to the federal employee because the -- there

20

would still be discrimination because some

21

state employees that are similarly situated are

22

treated more favorably than the federal

23

employees.

24
25

And so, if there is a close

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But what if there

are two groups of state employees, let's say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

group 1 and group 2, and they're similarly

2

situated to each other -­

3

MR. ROSENBERG:

Uh-huh.

4

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- and then a

5

group of federal -- federal employees who are

6

similarly situated to both group 1 and group 2?

7

In that situation, does the State have

8

to treat the federal employees the same as the

9

most favored group, if group 1 has a favorable

10

tax treatment, or does the State in that

11

example have discretion since the federal

12

employees are similarly situated to both group

13

1, who gets the favorable, and group 2, who

14

does not?

15

MR. ROSENBERG:

Justice Kavanaugh, the

16

State has to treat the federal employees the

17

same as the favored state employees.

18

has discretion to treat its own employees

19

differently for various reasons, including

20

arbitrary reasons, but once it does so through

21

state taxation, the State has to treat the

22

federal employees as well as the favored state

23

employees.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The State

I -- I don't follow -­
What if -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- why that is so.

If

2

the -- if you have two categories of state

3

employees and they're very similar and they're

4

treated differently, and then you have a

5

category of federal employees who are similar

6

to both of those categories of state employees,

7

wouldn't you have to determine which group of

8

state employees are most -- are more similar to

9

the federal employees?

10

Otherwise, it -- I

don't see how it's discrimination.

11

MR. ROSENBERG:

So, Justice Alito, I

12

don't think you have to determine that because,

13

again, it's an individual right against

14

discrimination.

15

precedents like the ICC and railroad precedents

16

from the 1930s, looks at Alabama versus CSX,

17

when you're actually trying to figure out who

18

you're comparing it to, you look at -- at who

19

-- the language of the statute, the purpose of

20

the statute, the context of the statute.

21

And here, again, it -­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If this Court looks to the

But an

23

antidiscrimination provision doesn't

24

necessarily require a most favored nation

25

clause.

And as I understand your answers to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

Justices Kavanaugh and Alito, you're saying

2

there's a most favored nation requirement.

3

MR. ROSENBERG:

Justice Kagan, two

4

responses.

One, typically, you don't have a

5

most favored nation requirement, as you note.

6

Two, I'm not sure it's most favored here.

7

only that where the State has drawn sort of an

8

arbitrary distinction and it's got effectively

9

identically situated state employees, one that

It's

10

gets the exemption, one that doesn't, and the

11

federal employee is similar to both, that this

12

sort of comes in where the -- the tie here goes

13

to the federal government.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Have any -­

Can we get away

16

from the academic two -- two classes and

17

compare the two state groups?

18

police officers, firefighters, and others are

19

exempt.

20

I take it that

A few are not exempt.
Within the state category, the state's

21

two category, which one is the larger -- which

22

is -- one is more like the federal marshals?

23

MR. ROSENBERG:

Justice Ginsburg, the

24

larger group, as far as we can tell and the

25

record reflects, is the state law enforcement

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

personnel who are exempt.

2

state troopers, it includes all deputy

3

sheriffs, for example.

4

It includes all

If we're actually comparing

5

Mr. Dawson, he's plainly most like a deputy

6

sheriff.

7

deputy sheriffs have the same authority.

8

only non-exempt individual that the State has

9

tried to compare Mr. Dawson to is, in its brief

Under West Virginia law, sheriffs and
The

10

in this Court, it tried to compare him to

11

sheriffs.

12

have the same job duties, have the same

13

authority under West Virginia law.

14

But sheriffs and deputy sheriffs

Mr. Dawson, in fact, was a deputy

15

sheriff in West Virginia before he became a

16

deputy United States Marshal.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but

18

there -- he -- he was different things.

19

not just somebody who was working in the

20

Marshals Service.

21

then maybe you have an argument with respect to

22

the other state.

23

Marshal -­

He was for a while.

He's

And

But he was also the U.S.

24

MR. ROSENBERG:

Right.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

-- and that is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

not like a cop on the beat.

2

he's not accompanying fugitives when they move

from one -- I mean prisoners when they move

from one place to another.

5

know, more policy, administrative.

6

of his retirement money come from his time as

7

U.S. Marshal?

8
9
10

MR. ROSENBERG:

I would suspect

His job is, you
Does some

I believe some of it

does, but some also from when he was a deputy.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, what do

11

you do in that situation?

I mean, we have

12

different comparators on the state side, but he

13

himself embodies, at least arguably, two

14

entirely different types of job.

15

MR. ROSENBERG:

He embodies multiple

16

jobs, but his basic duties as a law enforcement

17

officer didn't change.

18

responsibilities as a law enforcement officer.

19

Whether he was doing the same thing on a daily

20

basis I don't think is the proper inquiry.

21

He had the same

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I don't think

22

that's right.

His responsibilities didn't

23

include tracking down fugitives or the other

24

things that somebody, you know, at the -- at

25

the sort of operational level of the service

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

does.

2

MR. ROSENBERG:

What -­

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, would

4

you say the Attorney General would qualify in

5

this situation?

6

He has law enforcement duties.

MR. ROSENBERG:

Probably not, but -­

7

but that -- that's a different circumstance.

8

On pages -- in the JA, pages 176 -­

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

10

different?

11

the President, right?

Well, how

I mean, a marshal is appointed by

12

MR. ROSENBERG:

Yes.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

14

confirmed by the Senate, right?

15

MR. ROSENBERG:

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And -- and

That's true.
Well, that

17

seems to me a little bit different than -­

18

than, as I said, the -- you know, someone

19

who's, day one, starting at the bottom level at

20

the Marshals Service.

21

MR. ROSENBERG:

Well, he did work for

22

quite a while as a deputy United States

23

Marshal.

24
25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, yeah,

but I'm wondering whether or not we should be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

parsing out if part of his retirement seems

2

similar and part not.

3

MR. ROSENBERG:

Well, I think it's all

4

similar because, as a United States Marshal,

5

even presidentially appointed, he still had the

6

same law enforcement authority as the covered

7

state employees.

8
9

And this is the problem with the
State's test.

The -- the inquiry shouldn't be

10

is he identical to certain state employees; is

11

-- it's whether he's similar enough that

12

discriminatory tax treatment is justified.

13

And the State can't justify

14

discriminatory tax treatment just based on

15

whether he has some additional administrative

16

responsibilities, but his basic law enforcement

17

function is the same.

18

And the -- perhaps the most important

19

point, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the State has

20

repeatedly conceded throughout the litigation

21

that the job duties are the same.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Is the head of

23

the Marshals Service covered?

In other words,

24

not one of the state marshals but the -- the

25

head of the Marshals Service?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1
2

MR. ROSENBERG:

The U.S. Marshals

Service?

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

4

MR. ROSENBERG:

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yes.

I -- I believe so.
So his -- his

6

duties are the same as somebody who's on his

7

first day?

8
9

MR. ROSENBERG:

Oh, you mean the head

of the Marshals Service nationally?

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

MR. ROSENBERG:

Yeah.

Well, I don't know

12

that that person's in West Virginia, but I

13

think there'd be an argument that he was -­

14
15
16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, he lives

somewhere.
MR. ROSENBERG:

Yeah.

I mean, I think

17

there may be an argument that he is.

18

that's a different case.

19

the actual facts of the job duties.

20

think, in this case, whether it was deputy U.S.

21

Marshal, U.S. Marshal, or when he was a deputy

22

sheriff, pages JA 176 and 177 show that

23

Mr. Dawson had the same job duties.

24
25

I think

It would depend on
I -- I

The State's never contested that.
And, indeed, as a U.S. Marshal, Mr. Chief

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

Justice, Mr. Dawson testified at those pages

2

that there were two critical similarities among

3

others.

4

enforce West Virginia law as a U.S. Marshal.

5

One was that he was entrusted to

And the second was that, for fugitive

6

task forces, he could deputize the very same

7

state troopers and deputy sheriffs who are

8

exempted under the West Virginia plan.

9
10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I go back to

the two categories?

11

MR. ROSENBERG:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

So -­

Yes.
Let's assume

they're identical.

14

MR. ROSENBERG:

Uh-huh.

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right?

And I

16

know that you're arguing that they're not, and

17

this may be an issue, if we get to it, to

18

remand, okay?

19

the difference was as articulated by

20

Respondents here, one paid more than the other

21

to the pension plan, so they -- the State

22

wanted to be more generous to those who paid

23

more, as I think is the case here.

24
25

But assuming they were, and if

Why is that any different in kind to
our suggestions in Davis and in other places

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

that, if a scheme relied on the benefits paid

2

out, anybody who made less than $15,000 a year

3

in retirement benefits was exempt, but someone

4

who made more wasn't, why is that different in

5

kind to this situation?

6

MR. ROSENBERG:

7
8
9

Several responses,

Justice Sotomayor.
First, it's different in kind here
because it's not the line the State drew.

The

10

State didn't draw a line based on benefits.

11

They could have.

12

facially neutral scheme that perhaps exempted a

13

certain contribution rate or a certain benefit

14

payout, but that's not what they did here.

15

They could have done a

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What difference does

16

that make?

17

where the State says state employees who are in

18

one of these four plans, and let's further

19

assume that everybody in those four plans

20

receives a lesser benefit or, alternatively,

21

contributes a greater percentage of their

22

salary to the plan.

23

I mean, let's assume a situation

So, you know, it's -- it's -- it's -­

24

the State has just decided, look, this is a

25

convenient way of identifying these people,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

but, in fact, all the people in these plans

2

have that characteristic, which makes them

3

different from the federal employees, that they

4

contribute more or that they receive less in

5

other benefits.

6

MR. ROSENBERG:

Because that's still

7

facially discriminatory, Justice Kagan.

If the

8

State had actually done a neutral criterion and

9

set benefit levels, even if no federal

10

employees then qualified, it would give the

11

federal government the opportunity to redo its

12

benefit plan so that they could potentially

13

qualify under the state exemption.

14

Here, there's no such opportunity, so

15

it's still facially discriminatory.

16

what Section 111 prohibits.

17

have done a number of things here, but it

18

didn't.

19

And that's

The State could

The things that the State proffers in

20

its brief as the supposedly distinguishing

21

financial characteristics, the State concedes

22

they have to be applied even-handedly to be

23

able to be legitimate differentiators between

24

tax winners and tax losers.

25

But, if you look at the record, pages

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

JA 28 and 29, the chart there, it makes it

2

abundantly clear that none of these are

3

even-handedly applied even within the state.

4

So there are some plans with higher benefits

5

that are exempted.

6

plans where there's entitlement to Social

7

Security that are exempted.

8

higher benefit rates.

9

Some not.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

There are some

Some not.

Some

Well, I guess my

10

hypothetical was meant to take that off the

11

table.

12

MR. ROSENBERG:

Sure.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

To say assuming that

14

that's not true -­

15

MR. ROSENBERG:

Right.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- and the State

17

really has categorized precisely as -- as to

18

benefit levels or contribution levels but not

19

in those terms, you're -- you know, not in

20

those terms, and you're saying that in itself

21

is impermissible?

22

MR. ROSENBERG:

Right, because it's

23

facially discriminatory.

And -- and it doesn't

24

provide any opportunity for any federal

25

employees to ever be part of it.

It would be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

different if it were done as a facially neutral

2

law.

3

In fact, most facially neutral laws,

4

regardless of whether there are a meaningful

5

number of federal employees who qualify or not,

6

would likely pass scrutiny under Section 111.

7

The first and critical problem here is that

8

this is facially discriminatory.

9

The second problem is what I

10

mentioned, that the line the State drew is

11

based on job duties.

12

identical.

13

the State proffers were not even-handedly

14

applied to the State and plainly weren't

15

involved in the line that the State actually

16

drew.

17

The job duties are

And the financial characteristics

The State also argues that the -- the

18

lower court opinion was correct,

19

notwithstanding Davis, because only a fairly

20

narrow category of State employees are

21

exempted.

22

rejected in Davis, and it can't carry the day

23

here.

But this argument was expressly

24

In Jefferson County, for example, this

25

Court looked at a fairly narrow category, state

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

judges versus federal judges, and only upheld

2

that taxation scheme because the federal judges

3

and state judges were treated the same.

4

And, indeed, that exemption was

5

facially neutral because there were people who

6

got the exemption who were state employees and

7

people who didn't who were state employees, and

8

the same, some federal employees got the

9

exemption and some didn't.

10

The State also argues that there has

11

to be undue interference with the federal

12

government.

13

test.

14

Certainly, if you look at United States versus

15

Mexico in Footnote 11, the Court makes very

16

clear that you could have interference with a

17

government or discrimination, either of which

18

invalidates the scheme under Section 111.

19

But that also has never been the

That was rejected in Davis as well.

Finally, the State argues that we've

20

talked about that you have to compare to the

21

most comparable individual.

22

mentioned that it really isn't that inquiry.

23

We've already

The inquiry is one of similarity.

Is

24

-- is the state retiree or employee similar

25

enough to the federal retiree or employee that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

there shouldn't be discrimination?

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose what -­

3

suppose that the person who's drafting this

4

bill for the state is trying to -- they think

5

that the police officers and the others really

6

-- they aren't paid very much and it's a

7

particularly dangerous job, and you know those

8

characteristics, so -- so they think they

9

should give them a tax break.

10

And then someone says, well, what

11

about the federal marshals, they do the same

12

thing?

13

do, but they get paid a lot more, you see.

14

And then the person replies:

Yes, they

And so the feds pay them a lot more

15

than we pay the state people.

16

we're doing it.

17

Okay?

So that's why

MR. ROSENBERG:

Is that okay or not?
It -- it's not for

three reasons, Justice Breyer.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHAEL R. HUSTON

11

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

12

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONERS

13
14
15

MR. HUSTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
We agree with Petitioner that this

16

West Virginia tax exemption here is facially

17

discriminatory.

18

critical feature that really gets to the heart

19

of some of the questions that several Justices

20

have posed this morning.

21

And that, I think, is the

It's instructive, I think, to focus on

22

the difference between the tax that the Court

23

struck down in Davis and Barker and the one

24

that the Court upheld in Jefferson County.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you just say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

what you mean by "facially discriminatory"?

2

MR. HUSTON:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

3

A tax is facially discriminatory when it's not

4

open to any federal employees ever, regardless

5

of what job duties they perform or what their

6

benefit level is or what their contribution

7

rate is.

8
9

And that was true of the statute -­
the tax statutes in Davis and Barker.

It's the

10

opposite of the structure that the Court upheld

11

in Jefferson County.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If that's the problem,

13

why were you suggesting that we remand this?

14

It would just seem as though we should decide

15

it if that's the problem.

16

MR. HUSTON:

Well, I -- I think that

17

even when a tax is facially discriminatory,

18

Your Honor, there is going to be a second

19

question, which is, is this particular employee

20

actually suffering discrimination?

21

And I think it gets to one of the

22

questions that you were asking my friend in

23

support of Petitioner, which is there can -- if

24

you imagine, for example, that Mr. Dawson was a

25

federally employed teacher, as opposed to a law

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

enforcement officer, this tax exemption is

2

still facially discriminatory.

3

in that hypothetical is not himself suffering

4

discrimination.

But Mr. Dawson

He's the wrong plaintiff.

5

And I also think that that's -­

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So what would -­

7

what precisely would you say would be open on

8

remand?

9

reverse but vacate and remand.

You're -- you're suggesting not
Remand so that

10

the West Virginia court could -- could consider

11

what?

12

MR. HUSTON:

Well, the West Virginia

13

state court never undertook the analysis of

14

whether Mr. Dawson is materially different from

15

the federal employees -- excuse me, from the

16

state employees who benefit from the exemption.

17

Now, if the Court feels like it has

18

all the information it needs, West Virginia has

19

now come forward in its brief and put forward

20

several purported justifications that it thinks

21

can sustain its law, we agree with Petitioner

22

that we don't think that the record bears out

23

any of those.

24
25

And if the Court thinks it has enough
to decide the case, we're comfortable with -­

don't -­

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well -- well,

4

it's, I think, related to your point.

5

are you on the dialogue I had with Mr.

6

Rosenberg?

7

your -- your boss, the Attorney General,

8

receives exempt?

9

11

Does -- are the benefits that, say,

MR. HUSTON:

10

Where

Your Honor -­

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Think

carefully before answering.

12

(Laughter.)

13

MR. HUSTON:

The government is much

14

more interested in the courts, lower courts

15

applying the correct legal rule than it is in

16

exactly where a state court draws the line.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm

18

sure.

19

you're going to carry out that division.

20

other words, say facially discriminatory, but

21

with respect to what duties, what category of

22

duties?

23

But I'm more interested in how -- how

MR. HUSTON:

In

Well, again, I think this

24

-- it depends on how the state has drawn the

25

class.

States are entitled to have whatever

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

kind of exemptions they want.

2

to make them available on equal terms to

3

federal employees.

4

structure of this tax in Jefferson County, and

5

it's the reason why the Court upheld the tax in

6

Jefferson County.

7

They just have

And that's exactly the

All federal judges, all state judges

8

were treated alike.

Other persons and other

9

employees, attorneys, were -- were treated

10

alike, whether it was state and federal.

11

think that that means that even if the

12

distinctions that the State is drawing are

13

somewhat arbitrary, that is fine as long as the

14

State is making an effort to afford equivalent

15

treatment to state and federal employees alike.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And I

But I guess what I -­

17

I don't understand about -- about what you

18

think ought to be left open on remand is, if

19

you think that the prime evil of this

20

legislation is that it's not facially neutral,

21

that a federal employee can't be a part of

22

these state plans, so could never be treated in

23

the same way, then all the State justifications

24

like these people get fewer benefits, these

25

people pay more in -- in -- in -- make more of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

a contribution, all of that, do I understand

2

your position correctly, is just irrelevant?

3

The -- you know, the -- the state

4

court could find that these people get less

5

benefits and that these people, the state

6

employees, make a greater contribution, and -­

7

and yet not be able to rule for the State.

8

that correct?

9

MR. HUSTON:

Is

It's not quite correct,

10

Your Honor, in this respect:

11

question is, is this plaintiff suffering

12

discrimination on the basis of source of pay?

13

The critical

And so, to return to your hypothetical

14

from the last -- from the last session, if you

15

imagine that it turns out that the State

16

actually has selected only those plans where

17

the employees, say, contribute less than

18

5 percent to their retirement and it has put in

19

the, you know, disfavored category all

20

employees who contribute more than 5 percent,

21

if Mr. Dawson is in the disfavored class, if it

22

turns out that he lines up with the class of -­

23

of workers that West Virginia is not affording

24

the benefit, he has not suffered

25

discrimination.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

Now, at the time we wrote the -­

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, but even if he is

3

in the favored class, you're saying he's not -­

4

no, I -- I -- okay, I get it.

5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

I get it.
What if he's -­

6

what if he's equivalent to both the favored and

7

the disfavored class?

8
9

MR. HUSTON:

Then what?
If -- if there's really

no basis at all on which to -- to make a

10

distinction between who the state has selected

11

and -- and who it has disfavored -- now, again,

12

we don't think there are really any cases like

13

that, but in that -- in that sort of unusual

14

situation, I do think Mr. Dawson would be

15

entitled to the exemption.

16

And the reason is that the State would

17

not be able to meet its burden to defend its

18

facially discriminatory law.

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let me try this out.

20

Let me try this out and see if this is close to

21

what you're saying.

22

Where you have a variety of categories

23

of state employees and some get the benefit in

24

question and some don't get the benefit in

25

question, so the first step would be you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

compare all the categories of -- the relevant

2

categories of state employees and you identify

3

the characteristics that distinguish the

4

employees in the favored class from the -- from

5

the characteristics of those in the disfavored

6

class.

7

whether the federal employees have those

8

characteristics.

And once you've done that, then you ask

9

That would be step two.

But the -- the --

I think even when

10

you do that, you will very -- unless this -­

11

unless the states get to do just about what any

12

-- whatever they want, you will have situations

13

where the federal employees are pretty similar

14

to the ones in the favored class, but they're

15

not identical.

16

And then you've got a judgment call.

17

And I don't quite know how to resolve that.

18

Now is this -- is this right?

19

I off base with this?

20

MR. HUSTON:

Is that -- or am

Your Honor, I think you

21

have it exactly right.

And I understand that

22

there are going to be, in some cases at the

23

margins, difficult questions, where it -- it's

24

hard to apply the test that the Court set out

25

in Davis.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

We're much more concerned about the

2

states actually undertaking that effort in good

3

faith.

4

with the West Virginia Supreme Court's opinion

5

is that it never even attempted that inquiry.

6

It never attempted to sort out whether these

7

federal employees are more similar to the state

8

employees who get the exemption.

9

And what we -- the problem that we have

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry -­

Could you -­
-- can you go back

12

and answer Justice Kagan's earlier question,

13

which is, what are -- what are we remanding

14

for?

15

concession that the job duties of federal

16

marshals are similar to the exempted class.

I -- I do think that there's been a

17

So what's left?

You -- you said

18

something to her that confused me.

19

you said, if the State had actually

20

differentiated their employees on the basis of

21

the contribution they made or the benefits they

22

received, then the scheme would be okay if the

23

federal marshals didn't -- well, they would

24

never make the contribution, so -- but maybe

25

they have different benefits.

I thought

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

MR. HUSTON:

2

State has argued, Your Honor.

3

to say that the -- the logic of their

4

exemption, although it's facially

5

discriminatory, actually turns on things like

6

contribution rates or whether the employees

7

contribute to Social Security.

8
9

Right.

That's what the
They attempted

If the record supported that argument
-- and I think that some of the -- several of

10

those arguments are being made for the first

11

time in this Court.

12

that, the State could potentially defend its

13

law on this basis.

14

If the record supported

Now we don't -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, what -- what

15

could -- what could -- this is going to the

16

exact same thing.

17

on a remand and what could the West Virginia

18

court find on a remand in -- in -- in defense

19

of a decision for West Virginia?

What could West Virginia say

20

MR. HUSTON:

If -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Like, how would that

22

opinion read, a pro West Virginia opinion on

23

remand?

24
25

MR. HUSTON:

If the -- if the West

Virginia Supreme Court found that, although the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

tax that's at issue here is facially

2

discriminatory, the state actually drew the

3

line to track a neutral criterion like

4

contribution rates or something.

5

contributes more than 6 percent gets the

6

benefit.

7

6 percent -­

Everybody who

Nobody who contributes less than

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

that was exactly my hypothetical.

10

MR. HUSTON:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Oh, well, that's -­

Right.
And your friend

12

answered it the other way.

And I -- I -- I

13

thought that he answered it the other way

14

because he said, even if they drew the line in

15

exactly that way, the problem with this statute

16

is that the federal employees can't get into

17

the state plans.

18

MR. HUSTON:

It is facial -- it is

19

still facially discriminatory.

20

facial -- it's still problematic, and states

21

should not draw their laws that way.

22

it turns out that the employee -- Mr. Dawson

23

matches up exactly on that logic that the State

24

has offered with the disfavored employees as a

25

matter of state law, he is the wrong plaintiff.

It's still

But, if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

He is not suffering discrimination.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but that

3

seems to me that you're looking at the State's

4

purpose, and I thought the whole point was that

5

you look just to the source of income.

6

MR. HUSTON:

Well, you certainly do

7

look to the source of income, Mr. Chief

8

Justice, but I think you also look at is -­

9

Davis said and -- and cases like Barker said,

10

we're going to look at what is the

11

justification the State has put forward for its

12

law.

13

neutral justification, that's fine.

And if they've actually put forward a

14

States have a great deal of

15

flexibility in what they can do with taxation.

16

The one thing they can't do is discriminate and

treat -- by treating federal employees worse

than their state counterparts.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

25

MS. SEE:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This Court's decision in Jefferson

3

County demonstrates whatever else is required

4

at the first stage in the intergovernmental tax

5

immunity doctrine, at minimum, the challenging

6

taxpayer must show that he is treated different

7

from similarly-situated state employees.

8

this Court consistently looks beyond labels, in

9

the words of Jefferson County, beyond the

And

10

state's name tag, to see how that challenger is

11

actually treated.

12

In this case, Petitioners have not

13

made out their -- that showing because

14

Mr. Dawson is treated the same as

15

similarly-situated state employees.

16

is Jefferson County, where the Court used the

17

first step of the analysis.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This case

I'm sorry, the

19

court below didn't say that.

20

said -- I think the court below very explicitly

21

said the two -- exempt category and federal

22

marshals were similar.

23

MS. SEE:

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

The court below

The -­
And they didn't

even look at the comparison at all.

They said

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

the purpose was not to discriminate; so, hence,

2

there was no discrimination.

3

MS. SEE:

Your Honor, it is true that

4

the state trial court found that federal

5

marshals have similar job duties to those who

6

receive the exemption.

7

that they do not also have similar job duties

8

to those who do not receive the exemption.

9
10

The court did not find

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's right.

It

didn't find that, so you can't rely on that?

11

MS. SEE:

No, Your Honor.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You have to -- you

13

have to defend its judgment.

14

based it on saying, if your purpose is to

15

benefit your state employees, that's not

16

discrimination.

17

MS. SEE:

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And I thought it

Yeah -­
Now that's a hard

19

line for me to accept because discrimination is

20

treating someone differently.

21

because you want to benefit someone else or to

22

-- or -- or harm another person, to me, seems

23

irrelevant.

24
25

MS. SEE:

Whether it's

Well, Your Honor, it is true

that the West Virginia Supreme Court focused on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

the first step of the analysis, and, there, the

2

court did undertake a totality of the

3

circumstances review.

4

But it was simply taking this Court at

5

its word in Davis, where this Court said that

6

the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine is

7

coextensive with Section 111 and that that

8

doctrine incorporates the entire history and

9

purpose of that doctrine.

10

And from the time of McCulloch, that

11

doctrine prevents discrimination against the

12

federal government.

13

Supreme Court focused on that particular aspect

14

of the first step inquiry.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So the West Virginia

The statute

16

prohibits discrimination against an officer or

17

employee because of the source of pay or

18

compensation.

19

20

statute is quite explicit.

21

is discrimination against an employee because

22

of the source of pay or compensation.

23

The statute doesn't concern are

MS. SEE:

The

What it prohibits

Yes, Your Honor, it's

24

discrimination based on source of pay or

25

compensation.

And we know that discrimination

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

has to include discrimination that at some

2

level interferes with government functions

3

because, again, that language in Section 111,

4

this Court said, must be interpreted

5

coextensive with the historical constitutional

6

doctrine.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if that were

8

true, then this would apply only when the

9

discrimination -- the alleged discrimination

10

affects a lot of employees, because other than

11

-- in fact, how many employees would have to be

12

affected before it would have any kind of

13

tangible effect on the finances of the federal

14

government?

15

MS. SEE:

No, Your Honor.

And that's

16

why we say that this is part of the analysis of

17

the first step, but in most cases, the more

18

common similarly-situated analysis will sort

19

out these cases.

20

the appropriate class is, that is another way

21

of determining the sorts of discrimination

22

that's at issue here.

23

That analysis determining who

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think

24

that -- I understand your point is because

25

there's discrimination, it's not necessarily

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

discrimination on the basis of source, if you

2

can find some other basis.

3

it's based on the amount of contributions or

4

whatever.

5

And then you'd say

But I understand Davis to talk -- to

6

say you don't get to do that.

7

saying, if you're federal, you don't get it,

8

they're going to assume that it's based on

9

something that's -- that's not permissible.

10
11
12

If you're

I mean, if your -- if that -- if your
basis is something else, you ought to say that.
You ought to say where -- where, you

13

know, people who have this percentage

14

contributions or whatever, and if the federal

15

employees don't qualify, they don't qualify.

16

But as soon as you say it's -- you have to have

17

the state retirement plan and not the fed's, I

18

think the idea in Davis was, well, you kind of

19

presume that that's based on discrimination

20

based on, as they say, the source of income.

21

MS. SEE:

No, Your Honor, that -­

22

that's not the appropriate analysis here,

23

because, in Phillips Chemical, which this Court

24

relied on heavily in Davis, this Court

25

expressly rejected the argument that a fact

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

that on its face a statute targeted in that

2

case specifically targeted those who dealt with

3

the federal government, that that was enough

4

without more to find discrimination.

5

Instead, the Court said the

6

appropriate analysis was to consider whether

7

the challenged taxpayer was, in fact, being

8

treated different from similarly-situated

9

employees.

10

And, of course, in Phillips -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think you're

11

having the problem I did from the beginning,

12

which is everybody breaks this down into two

13

steps, but it really is one step.

14

It -- it -- because you don't even get

15

to this inquiry unless state and federal

16

employees are being treated different.

17

seems like a very light load to carry.

18

The question is, are they similarly
situated?

Yes, Your Honor, that is the

And

I'm not sure.

A

reason, I -- I think, it's you can't do this,

it seems to me, except in a very crude basis

because there -- there's dozens of differences

7

between state employees, federal employees.

They categorize them differently.

They have

less in roughly similar categories, you can't

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

19

That statistic really doesn't tell us anything.

20

MS. SEE:

I

Well -- well, Your Honor, it

21

does -- it does bring us back to the situation

22

where there are some employees who have

23

identical job descriptions who receive the

exemption and some who don't.

25

that there's something else that's doing the

That indicates

dividing line in that statute.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, and to

3

get back -- this is pertinent, I think, to your

4

response to Justice Breyer and to me -- how do

5

you reconcile with your answer this language

6

from Davis?

7

In Davis, it said a tax exemption

8

truly intended to account for differences in

9

retirement benefits would not discriminate on

10

the basis of the source of those benefits, as

11

Michigan's statute does, whether it would

12

discriminate on the basis of the amount of

13

benefits received by individual retirees.

14

MS. SEE:

Yes.

First -­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So that's why

16

I -- I mean, I'm concerned about the idea that,

17

yes, it says the source, is it federal or

18

state, but we really think it's something else.

19

And Davis seems to say you can't do that.

20

MS. SEE:

Well, Your Honor, first, I

21

would note that that language comes at the

22

second step of the analysis, whether the burden

23

shifts to the state to find significant

24

differences between the state taxpayers.

25

But even so, the question would simply

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44

be, what does the tax actually do on the

2

ground?

3

Chemical and in Jefferson County that the Court

4

looks beyond the particular labels.

This Court has said in Phillips

5

In City of Detroit, this Court said

that's necessary in order to give due regard

for state taxing power.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

No.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Phillips

14

Chemical said the same thing.

15

the argument was that federal land was taxed

16

differently because of its size, value, or

17

number of employees.

18

There, it said

And what the Court said is the

19

classification erected by Texas law is not

based on such factors.

And that's because

at the way that the actual tax draws the

distinction.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So what is it?

What is it?

3

MS. SEE:

Here -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, what is it

5

that the -- the 20 towns with the police and

6

the state sheriffs and the state deputy

7

sheriffs and all these different -- what is it

8

they do that the federal marshals don't do?

9

MS. SEE:

Your Honor, the point of

10

commonality for those who receive the exemption

11

and those who don't is that they are state -­

12

they are law enforcement officers who are part

13

of a retirement plan that is open exclusively

14

to law enforcement.

15
16

JUSTICE ALITO:

That -- that can't be

--

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

That sounds like

18

you're saying we discriminate on the basis of

19

source.

20

MS. SEE:

No, Your Honor, because, to

21

-- to succeed at the similarly-situated

22

analysis, the State of West Virginia agrees

23

that if there were a retired federal law

24

enforcement officer who had a retirement plan

25

with similar characteristics, that that would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

be enough to succeed at this stage.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yeah.

But what you

3

say is let's look at the state plan here and

4

let's look at the federal plan.

So you're

5

saying they're the same people.

They do the

6

same thing.

7

Is there discrimination?

And you just seem to me to say:

No,

8

but the other side says, hey, they get a tax

9

break and we don't.

Now that sounds like

10

discrimination.

I mean, it may be justified or

11

whatever it is.

But the question is, is there

12

discrimination?

How do you explain that?

13

MS. SEE:

The -- the question is

14

whether there is discrimination based on the

15

source of income.

16

fact that the federal government, as opposed to

17

the state, is signing retirement checks is the

18

dividing line.

19

here.

20

And that means whether the

That's not the dividing line

JUSTICE ALITO:

Could you just

21

explain, what are the unique characteristics of

22

those who get the favorable treatment, the

23

characteristics that distinguish them from the

24

state employees who don't get it?

25

characteristics that they -- they have?

What are the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review

then we can see whether a marshal or a deputy

It's this benefits and

Benefits and contributions

is part of it, yes, Your Honor.

Another part

10

of it is that their plans are only available to

11

law enforcement officers.

12

plans raise particular funding considerations.

13

And those sort of

Law enforcement is a high-risk

14

profession, which means that it's more likely

15

that members of those plans are going to have

16

more benefits already.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, we can't

19

possibly -- I'm sorry.

20

22

Well -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

Deputy marshals have a

risk too.

There are some deputy

marshals who are eligible for the exemption but

not all of them.

2

whose retirements benefits come from a deputy

4

--

The deputy marshals don't

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6

MS. SEE:

Why does that matter?

It matters because the state

7

has decided that the particular funding

8

considerations of those plans warrant separate

9

tax treatment.

And as long as the State's

10

reason is not based on whether someone is a

11

federal or a state employee, states have

12

incredibly broad -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Ah, that's the nub of

14

this, it seemed to me, that -- that -- is it

15

the case that if the state never thought of

16

this, it wasn't against the marshals; it just

17

developed a system that meant that they have a

18

lot more money -- less money in their pocket

19

than comparable state.

20

Does that violate the statute?

Now I

21

thought the answer to that question is yes, it

22

does violate the statute.

23

state's actual reasons; just look into whether

24

they end up with less money in their pocket and

25

they're just -- maybe you could say a

Don't look into the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

justification, but the justification can't be,

2

well, we have a set of complicated retirement

3

systems that pays the state people even more.

4

MS. SEE:

Well, Your Honor, we -- we

5

agree that the State's -- the State's reason is

6

not the deciding line here.

7

is what the State actually did.

8
9
10

The deciding line

And the way to do that, as Phillips
Chemical explains, is to look at the way that
the favored tax class is drawn.

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So if I understand

12

what you -- what you're saying, I think you

13

suggested three characteristics of the members

14

of these plans, and one is that they receive

15

low benefits.

16

a very substantial portion of their earnings to

17

the plan.

18

understand, but your third is that the plan

19

itself is made up only of law enforcement

20

officers.

Another is that they contribute

And the third, which I'm not sure I

Is that correct?

21

MS. SEE:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Now it seems to me

23

that we couldn't possibly do anything -­

24

suppose -- even if you were right, that -- that

25

if the State showed all of that, I mean, we're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

not in a position to rule in your favor here.

2

At the very most, you're entitled to

3

-- or at the very most, what we should do is

4

remand so that the state court could figure out

5

whether, in fact, the members of this state

6

plan, as compared to federal employees, receive

7

lower benefits, make higher contributions, and

8

are similarly in a -- you know, and -- and -­

9

and don't share this characteristic of a

10

law-enforcement-only plan?

11

MS. SEE:

Well, Your Honor, we agree

12

that if this Court -- if this Court believes

13

that the determination of the case turns on

14

those fact-specific inquiries, particularly on

15

the significant differences test, the West

16

Virginia Supreme Court did not reach them.

17

State would agree that remand would be

18

appropriate to sort out those factual issues.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

you get a second chance?

Why should

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Well, Your Honor, it was

these taxpayers were not similarly situated to

those who receive the exemption.

At every stage in the

The West Virginia Supreme Court
focused on a separate aspect of the analysis,

10

focused on the doctrine's history and purpose.

11

If this Court rejects the analysis and it does

12

not feel that there's sufficient information in

13

the record to decide the case, then it should

14

allow the State to continue -- to continue its

15

argument back in the state courts on those

16

remaining arguments.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

What -- what -- what

18

strikes me about the way this argument has

19

gone, it's a little bit unexpected for me, is

20

that you and the SG actually agree.

21
22
23

MS. SEE:

We do, Your Honor, on most

parts.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because you think that

24

the states should be able to prove that the

25

members of this plan are different from federal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

made a non-neutral distinction.

Why shouldn't that be the end of the

inquiry under a normal statutory interpretation

4

analysis where we don't bother looking at

5

secret purposes when the plain text is clear?

6

MS. SEE:

Because, Your Honor, even

7

under that approach, Mr. Dawson, this

8

Petitioner, is not being treated different from

9

state employees.

The fact that there may be

10

another hypothetical federal retiree who could

11

bring a claim, who could bring an argument that

12

his or her retirement plan looks very similar

13

to the retirement plans exempted under West

14

Virginia law, that may be a case for another

day.

16

But that still leaves the fact that

this Petitioner has not made out a claim that

he is being treated differently.

6

All a state has to say is we're

It makes no sense to me, what you're

MS. SEE:

Well, no, Your Honor,

7

because we're not arguing that the Court needs

8

to look at all of the particular details of the

9

plan, but only what -- what is the broadest

10

point of commonality that sweeps in all of

11

those plans that receive the exemption and

12

those who don't.

13

And the State's position is that point

14

of commonality is that there are plans that are

15

available only to law enforcement officers.

16

That's all that this Court has to do.

17

And this Court may second-guess the wisdom of a

18

state giving a tax exemption based on that

19

criteria, but, respectfully, that's not a

20

decision for this Court and not one that the

21

government requests that it -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So, even if the

23

two plans are identical, merely because the

24

state chooses a police-officer-only plan,

25

that's enough of a difference to do away with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Davis?

2

MS. SEE:

Yes, Your Honor, to the

3

extent that they are identical in terms of

4

benefits or -- or -- or the way that term of

5

service is concluded.

6

because those aren't the distinctions in the

7

statute.

8
9
10

Yes, that may be true

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why isn't that

just plain source?
MS. SEE:

It's not plain source

11

because, as the State agrees, if there were a

12

federal retiree who was also part of a

13

law-enforcement-only retirement plan, then they

14

would pass this first stage.

15

But that does not mean that that -­

16

that that statute would automatically be struck

17

down, because the State would still have the

18

opportunity at the second stage of the analysis

19

to show that there are significant differences.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what would be

21

the argument for giving favorable treatment -­

22

suppose we're just talking about categories of

23

state employees, and you have -- you have law

24

enforcement -- you have law enforcement

25

officers who are basically identical, but one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

is in a law-enforcement-only plan and the other

2

is in a plan that includes other employees.

3

What would be the reason for treating those -­

4

those differently?

5

MS. SEE:

Well -- well, the reason, we

6

suggest, is because there are special funding

7

considerations when you have a retirement plan

8

that's only available to those in a high-risk

9

profession, such as law enforcement.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Well, so now

11

you're saying it's funding considerations, but

12

it's not just the fact that they're -- they're

13

only law enforcement officers.

14

MS. SEE:

No, Your Honor, I'm saying

15

that would be the justification for a state to

16

draw a line between law-enforcement-only and

17

something else.

18

look at the line in the statute and then to

19

take -- take the state statute at its word.

20

But the proper inquiry is to

In this case, we give an exemption to

21

members of law-enforcement-only plans.

there were a federal retiree who could raise

3

state -- the state has a -- all of its

4

employees are in one plan, okay, and the state

5

says those people get this benefit.

6

you have a federal employee who comes along,

7

and the state says, well, you don't get that

8

benefit because you weren't in the state plan.

9

I mean, you -- you think that's okay?

10

MS. SEE:

And now

We would say that employee,

11

yes, has made out a case that he or she is

12

being treated different than similarly-situated

13

state employees.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So then I don't

15

know what you're -- where you're going with the

16

fact that it turns on whether you're in one

17

plan or another plan.

18
19
20

MS. SEE:

It -- it turns on the

particular components of the plan.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, the components

21

of the plan, but not the mere fact that you are

22

or are not a -- a member of that plan.

23

MS. SEE:

Your Honor, it does depend

24

on whether someone is a member of the plan, but

25

in order to determine if a similarly-situated

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

federal employee is being treated different, we

2

have to look at what describes that plan.

3

are those characteristics?

4

What

And if they were a federal employee

5

who could show that his or her retirement plan

6

had similar characteristics, then, yes, we

7

would agree that person's treated different

8

from similarly-situated employees.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But, in fact, there

10

is no such -- we know what the federal

11

retirement plans are, and there's no retirement

12

plan like these four.

13
14
15

MS. SEE:

Correct, Your Honor.

And -­

and that's -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And you say -- and

16

you say that that's enough and it doesn't

17

matter that the job duties are identical.

18

doesn't matter that there are many more law

19

enforcement officers covered -- given the

20

exemption than the ones left out in Virginia.

21

None of that matters as long as their -- the

22

source of the benefits of these discrete plans,

23

there is no such federal plan.

24

That's your position?

25

MS. SEE:

It

End of case.

Yes, Your Honor, that's what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

this Court held in Jefferson County.

2

the federal taxpayers made an argument that it

3

was impossible for them to ever qualify for the

4

county exemption.

5
6

There,

This Court said that was not enough to
strike that statute.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the Court

8

said in Jefferson County that state judges and

9

federal judges were treated the same.

10

MS. SEE:

They did say they were

11

treated the same, and job duties was relevant

12

there because the statute drew distinctions

13

based on individuals who were members of

14

covered professions who did or did not pay

15

other state license fees.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

So that -­
I began to see this

17

as a different issue than I had initially

18

thought.

19

Okay?

So don't say I'm right if I'm wrong.

20

MS. SEE:

All right.

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

And if I'm off base,

23

just say it.

But the statute says you cannot

24

tax the pay of a -- or compensation of a

25

federal official if the tax -- unless the tax

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

does not discriminate because of the source of

2

the pay or compensation.

3

MS. SEE:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So then we

5

have some money that the marshals get.

And

6

they put that money into a federal fund, which

7

is a retirement fund.

8

taxation discriminates against them, but not

9

because of their pay or compensation, but,

And the state in its

10

rather, because of the nature of the retirement

11

fund that they put it in.

12

Is that what you're saying?

13

MS. SEE:

Yes, if the distinction is

14

based on the type of retirement fund, and,

15

again, the only reason that distinction matters

16

is because that's the distinction in the state

17

tax code.

18

And in Phillips Chemical, this Court

19

said that is the line the Court should look at.

20

How has the state drawn the favored class -­

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

It's a simple -­

So where did I get -­

24

I didn't -- for some reason, it's not

25

necessarily your fault, but I -- this is a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

fairly simple point.

2

Look at the retirement fund, and if

3

that's the basis for the discrimination against

4

the federal employees, that's fine.

5

their pay or compensation.

6
7

And -- and that's what we should be
looking at?

8
9

MS. SEE:

Your Honor, I would add to

that -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MS. SEE:

12
13

That isn't

Is that right?

Yes, but I would add to

that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Then I didn't get

14

that out of the brief too well, but maybe

15

that's my fault.

16

MS. SEE:

Okay.
Well, if -- if the

17

distinction is that is a federal retirement

18

plan and that is the reason that someone is or

19

is not in the favored class, then that would be

20

discriminatory under the doctrine.

21

But that's not what this West Virginia

22

tax regime is doing, because the reality is

23

there are many state -- state retirees, over

24

98 percent, who are in the disfavored class.

25

And there are many state law enforcement

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65

officers, some with identical jobs, who are

2

also in the disfavored class.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It seems to me

that Davis makes it very clear that that's not

a significant consideration.

6

small retirement benefit, and say this is

7

available for all people who do X, unless

8

you're paid from a federal plan, would that

9

violate Davis or not?

10

If you have a

You have 99 percent of the state

11

employees are not eligible for it, but it says

12

if you're in this category, a tiny category,

13

you get the benefit, unless you're a federal

14

retiree.

15

MS. SEE:

Well, Your Honor, the first

16

question would be whether the particular

17

challenger is, in fact, in that tiny category.

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but that

19

first question was not the one I asked.

20

asked a different one, which is you argued

21

that, well, it depends on how many of the state

22

employees are eligible or not.

23

Davis said specifically it doesn't, it depends

24

upon the source.

25

I

And I thought

So if it -- if it's five employees in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

the state, and there's one who's a federal

2

employee, and your plan says these five get it

3

and no federal employee gets it, does that

4

violate Davis or not?

5

MS. SEE:

Your Honor, in that case, it

6

probably would.

And that's because we're not

7

saying that the sheer small number of employees

8

who would benefit or not matters.

9

relevant, though, because this tax regime

It's

10

treats 98 percent of state employees different

11

from -­

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you just

13

said it doesn't matter and then you tell me it

14

matters.

15

MS. SEE:

Well, Your Honor, it matters

16

only because it's indication that the actual

17

dividing line in the state tax code is not

18

state versus federal.

19

dividing line.

20

particular plans that they're part of.

21

also, if this Court remands on the significant

22

differences standpoint, then the state would be

23

able to show that there are vastly different

24

contribution levels.

25

Something else is the

Here, the dividing line is the

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And

On -- on job

duties, if -- if we conclude that that's most

2

significant, were Dawson's job duties similar

3

to the duties of the favored state employees?

4

MS. SEE:

They were similar, yes, Your

5

Honor, but that does not end the inquiry

6

because they were just as similar to the

7

disfavored state law enforcement employees.

8
9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Okay.

And your

opposing counsel says in that circumstance

10

where you're similar to both the favored and

11

the disfavored state employees, that the state

12

is required to go with the favored state

13

employees as the treatment for the federal

14

employees, if you're following me.

15

opposing counsel wrong on that point?

16

MS. SEE:

Why is your

Because courts are never

17

required to turn a blind eye to evidence in the

18

record that shows that the comparison class a

19

plaintiff has brought forward is inappropriate.

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, why is it

21

inappropriate?

That's the point.

22

appropriate in that circumstance -­

MS. SEE:

They're both

that they're similarly situated in both the

just said, I think.

3

MS. SEE:

That's what you

Right, because it doesn't

4

show what -- what the actual dividing line is

5

in that case.

6

between those who have certain job duties or

7

not, because a police officer who lives five

8

miles away from another police officer may have

vastly different state tax treatment with

12

That's not how the state

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But I think the

13

only way to be sure in that circumstance that

14

we're describing that you're not discriminating

15

against the federal employees is to be -- to

16

give them the treatment that the favored state

17

employees get.

18

If you give them the treatment that

19

the disfavored state employees get, you're

20

never going to be sure whether that's based on

21

discrimination against the federal government

22

or not.

23

target, making sure that there's not

24

discrimination against the federal employees.

25

And that's what the statute seems to

MS. SEE:

Your Honor, this Court has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

never held a most favored taxpayer standard.

2

In fact, in Jefferson County, that was just as

3

true there, because there were many state

4

officers who received the exemption and did

5

not.

6

This Court found that the fact that

7

there were some who were like the federal

8

challengers there in the disfavored class, that

9

was enough to find that similarly-situated

10

taxpayers were, in fact, treated the same.

11

matter what other issues may exist for another

12

day, for another federal employee, this one is

13

treated the same.

ROSENBERG ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. ROSENBERG:

I just have a few

points in rebuttal.
First of all, in response to the

22

question that Justice Breyer and the Chief

23

Justice posed at the end, this plainly is

24

discrimination based on the source.

25

in the state plans, you get the exemption.

If you're

Heritage Reporting Corporation

No

federal plans get the exemption.

2

classic discrimination based on source.

3

That is

Secondly, there is no reason for

4

remand.

5

me and my brother from the Solicitor General's

6

Office is actually much smaller than it

7

appears.

8

was saying is that there's no question that, at

9

step one of Davis, this is facially

10
11

And I do think that the space between

What I think the Solicitor General

discriminatory.

It -- it violates the law.

The question is, are U.S. Marshals the

12

right plaintiffs?

13

articulated its reasons for arguing that they

14

were, the government said maybe a remand would

15

be appropriate.

16

And before the State had

Here, however, we know what the state

17

has argued.

18

financial considerations that plainly are not

19

the line that the state drew.

20

itself, the Joint Appendix establishes that the

21

-- the factors that the state argues were not

22

even-handedly drawn.

23

The state has argued these

The record

In this circumstance, there is no

24

reason for a remand.

Moreover, many of the

I'm sorry.
You've got a lot

Give me specifics.

MR. ROSENBERG:

Sorry.

Sorry.

Okay.

8

Specifically what I was going to say is, if you

9

talk about the amount of compensation, where

10

the entitlement to Social Security, right, we

11

know that those are not even-handedly applied

12

because we know that some state plans that have

13

higher benefits get the exemption.

14

Some don't.

We know that some entitlement to

the basis for the line that the state drew and

21

they're not even-handedly applied.

22

Some

We know some higher contribution rates

Right?

Some don't.

That's Joint

That chart shows that

So we know that they weren't

Moreover, many of those arguments were

23

raised in the circuit court, and the circuit

24

court rejected them and said Davis precludes

25

them because they're just ultimately an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
72
1
2

argument about the amount of compensation.
And if the state were going to draw

3

the line based on that, it would have drawn the

4

line neutrally based on the line of

5

compensation, not done it the way it did, which

6

was to discriminate based on source.

7
8
9

So none of these are legally relevant,
and, therefore, a remand is not appropriate.
Third, the burden on the State here is

10

rather light.

11

for is for the states to draw facially-neutral

12

lines, and that is not a difficult burden.

13

There are no state amici in this case

14

supporting West Virginia, and that suggests

15

that nobody's up in arms, other than West

16

Virginia, about the issues here.

17

Under Davis, all we're asking

Finally, with respect to the record,

18

my friend argues about sheriffs and deputy

19

sheriffs, but, if you look at page 17 of our

20

reply brief, we cite the state's brief at page

21

12, and West Virginia Code Section 7-14D-24.

22

If you were a deputy sheriff or a

23

state trooper, and then became a sheriff,

24

you're still covered.

25

And there's nothing in the record that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
73
1

indicates that most sheriffs weren't previously

2

deputy sheriffs or state troopers.

3

the sheriff distinction that the state makes

4

isn't -- isn't supported here.

5

doesn't justify this notion that counsel

6

mentioned about law-enforcement-only plans.

7

The plans that the State gives the

So the -­

And the record

8

exemption to are law enforcement and

9

firefighter plans.

So it's not a

10

law-enforcement-only plan.

11

particular distinction has never been raised

12

before and simply doesn't matter.

13

And -- and that

Look, at bottom here, in McCulloch

14

versus Maryland, the Court said that, in

15

general, we don't want to be micromanaging all

16

the details of state taxation.

Here, the categorical rule of Davis is

18

the right rule.

facially-discriminatory tax schemes like West

and doesn't burden the states nearly as much.
