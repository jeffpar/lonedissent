ORAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. PINCUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly recognized

12

that the changes brought about by the shift

13

from bilateral arbitration to class action

14

arbitration are fundamental.

15

The question in this case is what

16

standard a court should apply in determining

17

whether an arbitration agreement authorizes

18

class arbitration.

19

As a threshold matter, we think it's

20

clear that federal law imposes a minimum

21

standard that must be satisfied in order to

22

permit class arbitration.

23

clear in Stolt-Nielsen, where it said a party

24

may not be compelled under the FAA to submit to

25

class arbitration unless there is a contractual

The Court made that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

basis for concluding that the party agreed to

2

do so.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But don't you make

4

that determination under state law?

5

think the FAA in any way undoes state law,

6

unless the basis of the state law is directed

7

only at arbitration, which isn't the case here.

8

MR. PINCUS:

9

correct, Your Honor.

I didn't

I don't think that's
The clear and

10

unmistakable standard that was being discussed

11

in the last case is a -- is a standard that the

12

FAA imposes.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, that's a

14

standard that's basically dicta because there

15

the parties agree the agreement didn't.

16

MR. PINCUS:

So -­

No, but -- but in First

17

Options, where the Court adopted that standard,

18

the Court said that it was the FAA that imposes

19

the clear and unmistakable requirement before

20

the -- before an arbitration agreement may be

21

construed to delegate gateway issues to the

22

arbitrator.

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I do have one

24

more question for me.

You claim there's

25

jurisdiction for you to appeal this case.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

Let's assume the plaintiff or the

2

Petitioner, or I guess it would be the

3

Respondent here -- either way, that a party who

4

seeks class arbitration is denied class

5

arbitration.

6

Can they appeal directly to us?

MR. PINCUS:

If -- if the case is in

7

the same posture as this one where the district

8

court dismissed the action, then -- then the -­

9

the provision that we rely on,

10
11
12
13
14
15

Section 16(a)(3), would provide for an appeal.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what's good for

the goose is good for the gander?
MR. PINCUS:

Absolutely, Your Honor.

And that's -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

So

16

we're going to be filled with all of these

17

interim orders denying or granting class

18

arbitration, as the case may be, because each

19

losing party will have the opportunity to come

20

to us and the arbitration won't proceed?

21

MR. PINCUS:

Well, it's not just class

22

arbitration.

Today, in the lower courts, when

23

a lower court dismisses a case and grants

24

arbitration -- in favor of an order granting

25

arbitration, those -- those cases are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

immediately appealable in courts like the Ninth

2

Circuit.

3

pending right now in the Ninth Circuit on that

4

basis.

5

And there are many, many appeals

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

staying those cases?

7

MR. PINCUS:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. PINCUS:

10
11

The courts aren't

Excuse me?
They haven't -­

Some courts stay them and

some courts don't, Your Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Why?

I mean,

12

throughout -- again, throughout law, there's

13

always a fight between making interlocutory

14

matters immediately appealable, which, if you

15

do, will often save a lot of money, and waiting

16

'til the end.

17

wait 'til the end.

18

exceptions, mandamus and certifying a question.

19

When we read the statute, it says what

And the normal decision here is
And then there are

20

the district court shall do if he is satisfied

21

that this is arbitrable, shall on application

22

of one of the parties stay the trial of the

23

action until the arbitration has been had.

24
25

This judge didn't do it, and you
didn't -- your predecessor didn't ask him to do

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

it.

So this seems like a fluke.

But, if we

2

were to say these are appealable, it's not only

3

contrary to a very basic principle of -- of how

4

to run courts, but it's also, because of that,

5

going to have just the effect Justice Sotomayor

6

said.

7

MR. PINCUS:

Well, a couple of

8

answers, Your Honor.

9

same posture as Randolph, where the Court made

This case is in the exact

10

the initial decision that 16(a)(3), coupled

11

with a dismissal, provides for an immediate

12

appeal.

13

The Court in Randolph noted that there

14

was a question about the question that Your

15

Honor raises, whether it's proper for a

16

district court to issue a stay or to dismiss

17

the case, and said that didn't -- that wasn't

18

briefed, it wasn't a question before the court,

19

it wasn't going to decide it.

20

-- in the same posture.

21

This case is in

It may be that the Court should take a

22

case to decide the question whether district

23

courts have the power to dismiss rather than

24

stay, but the issue is not presented here and

25

hasn't been briefed here.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I ask, Mr. Pincus,

2

if you could go back to the -- the substantive

3

argument?

4

So, in -- in a strange kind of way, it

5

occurred to me, as Mr. Geyser was speaking,

6

your position is very similar to Mr. Geyser's.

7

You both have these very broad -- this very

8

broad contractual language, right?

9

broad delegation clause, and you have

He had a

10

contractual language that refers to all

11

disputes, claims, or controversies in lieu of

12

any and all suits or other civil legal

13

proceedings.

14

And -- and what I hear you to be

15

saying is essentially that you want to say

16

except for class suits.

17

MR. PINCUS:

Is that right?

I don't think so, Your

18

Honor.

19

case brings before the Court, as I said, is the

20

question that Stolt-Nielsen didn't address.

21

What Stolt-Nielsen said was silence isn't

22

enough -­

23

I -- I think what -- what -- what this

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, I -- I'm just

24

thinking as a -- as a matter first of -- of

25

just contract law, because he said what we have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

here is we can't really believe that the

2

parties agreed to include a certain set of

3

things.

4

same thing.

5

parties agreed to be speaking of class claims.

6

And -- and I hear you to be saying the
We can't really believe that the

MR. PINCUS:

I think the contractual

7

language here is actually quite clear.

8

the language you quote -- that Your Honor

9

quoted is language about what can't be done.

10

The -­

There's a provision, and it appears on

11

pages 24a to 25a of the petition appendix,

12

that's captioned -- that's headed Claims

13

Covered by the arbitration provision.

14

says, "The company and I mutually consent to

15

the resolution of all claims or controversies,

16

past, present, or future, that I may have

17

against the company or against its officers" -­

18

and I'll skip some language, blah, blah,

19

blah -- "or that the company may have against

20

me.

21

consent to the resolution by arbitration of all

22

claims that may hereafter arise in connection

23

with my employment or any of the parties'

24

rights or obligations arising under this

25

agreement."

And it

So we think the agreement is actually

2

quite clear.

3

asking -­

4

And this isn't a case where we're

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it seems to me,

5

I mean, there's -- there's language that's in

6

favor of each side's position.

7

disputes, claims, or controversies," "all suits

8

or other legal proceedings" goes against you.

9

You would suggest that "I, me, and my" cuts for

10

The "all

you.

11

You know, I'm -- I'm -- I'm not quite

12

sure that that's the case, but -- you know,

13

because it's an agreement between these two

14

parties about suits, and the question is, what

15

kind of suits is it about and whether there's a

16

kind of implicit exception for class claims in

17

suits.

18

MR. PINCUS:

I don't think it's about

19

an implicit concept -- exception, Your Honor.

20

In Stolt-Nielsen, the Court said we can't

21

presume from a -- an arbitration -- the fact of

22

an arbitration agreement that the parties have

23

agreed to class arbitration because of the

24

fundamental differences.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -­
Yes, but in -- in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

Stolt-Nielsen, there was no contract.

2

was no agreement.

3

understood there was a stipulation to the

4

effect that there was no agreement on this

5

issue and -- and -- and instead there was just

6

a -- a policy determination.

7

There

And, you know, everybody

But, here, there is a contract.

And

8

the question is, what does the contract mean?

9

Does it mean all disputes, claims, or

10

controversies?

Or does it mean all disputes,

11

claims, or controversies, except class

12

disputes, claims, and controversies because we

13

really think that not -- that the party would

14

not -- that the party who drafted the contract

15

would not have agreed to that?

16

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I -- I guess I'll

17

-- there are a couple of questions embodied in

18

your question, I think.

19

Stolt-Nielsen, there was an agreement.

20

parties agreed that the agreement didn't speak

21

to the question of class arbitration.

22
23

The

We think this agreement too doesn't
speak to the question of class arbitration.

24
25

I -- I think -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, we would never

say -­

MR. PINCUS:

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- that in general.

general clause usually speaks to the things

4

inside it.

5

means tables and chairs.

6

clothing, it usually means pants and shirts.

7

And we don't insist that everybody lay out all

8

the subcategories of things.

9

If I say all furniture, it usually
If I say all

So this question is here you have an

10

overall, you know, term, "disputes, claims, or

11

controversies."

12

disputes, claims, or controversies, unless

13

there's some kind of special contractual

14

interpretive rule coming in that we wouldn't

15

apply in other contexts?

16

Why wouldn't you include class

MR. PINCUS:

Well, we think

17

Stolt-Nielsen said that there is a special

18

contractual rule and that there are -- there

19

are two possibilities there.

20

We think the most sensible rule is to

21

apply the clear and unmistakable standard

22

because of the fundamental change that arises

23

from class arbitration to -- from bilateral

24

arbitration to class arbitration.

MR. PINCUS:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Now we're creating

Well -­
-- something we're

loathe to do in virtually every other context?

6

MR. PINCUS:

Well, just -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I think we were

8

very clear that it's a matter of contract and

9

state law controls that.

10

MR. PINCUS:

I -- I think the Court

11

has not been clear, Your Honor.

12

Options specifically says that, although

13

contractual interpretation is generally a

14

question of state law, in this context, the

15

court created, based on the FAA, a special

16

interpretive rule that said -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

That's really

interesting.

19

21

Again, First

-- clear -­
Where does the FAA

give us that right?
MR. PINCUS:

The Court many years ago

23

in Moses Cone said there was another

24

contractual rule, which says that close

25

questions about arbitrability should go to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

arbitrability because of the policy embodied in

2

the FAA.

3
4

JUSTICE BREYER:
finish that.

5

Look, I want you to

Are you finished?

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I was just going to

6

respond to Justice Sotomayor's question about

7

where the -- where that comes from in the FAA.

8
9

And I think it comes from Section 4 of
the FAA.

What the Court has said and what the

10

Court said both in First Options and in

11

Stolt-Nielsen where the Court made this exact

12

same point about the general rule being federal

13

-- being state law, but there being an FAA

14

overlay, is that it comes from the requirement

15

in Section 4 that the parties be directed to

16

proceed to arbitration in accordance with the

17

terms of the agreement.

18

And I think in both contexts what the

19

Court has said is that this is to find -- to be

20

sure that it is the terms of the agreement in

21

this special case.

22

In the -- in the case addressed by

23

First Options, the gateway issues, the concern

24

is this is a delegation of very broad power to

25

the arbitrator, and, therefore, there should be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

certainty that the parties are delegating that

2

power to the arbitrator.

3

Here, again, delegation of

4

extraordinarily broad power to the arbitrator,

5

as this Court has discussed in a number of

6

opinions about class arbitration, therefore, we

7

think the same test should apply.

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

All right.
So is your -- I'm

sorry.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, you go ahead.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is your position

13

that the decision below was right on state law?

14

Basically, you're not quarrelling that this

15

contract was ambiguous, that it was susceptible

16

to the meaning Petitioner -- that Respondent

17

gave it, and that under California law, that

18

would encompass this claim because they weren't

19

the drafters?

20
21
22
23
24
25

Is your position now that federal
common law is superseding state law -­
MR. PINCUS:

Well, I -- I think our

position -­
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- on how to

interpret a contract?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

MR. PINCUS:

-- I think our position

2

has consistently been that our principal

3

argument is that there is a federal rule that

4

Stolt-Nielsen identified -­

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

I -- I asked you a

different question.

7

MR. PINCUS:

And our position on -- on

8

California law is we think that the lower court

9

did wrongly apply California law and applied it

10

in a way to reach a result, and -- and we point

11

to the two California court of appeals -- court

12

of appeal decisions.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

But if I got

14

you right, your said your principal position is

15

that there's a federal rule that would come in

16

even if the California courts got California

17

law right, and that in many cases analogous to

18

this, you would have read this contract to

19

include both class claims and individual

20

claims.

21

MR. PINCUS:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23
24
25

Well -­
It's really a federal

rule that you're asking for.
MR. PINCUS:
federal rule.

We -- we are advocating a

I -- I would say that if the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

Court looks at the cases cited in our petition,

2

there's no court applying -- looking at the

3

issue de novo rather than at an arbitrator's

4

decision that has construed language like this

5

to encompass class arbitration.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

You know, I

7

guess I gave you a bunch of reasons why, in

8

looking at a normal contract, under normal

9

contractual principles, you might think that

10

all this extremely general language included

11

everything inside it.

12

even if you think that, there's a federal law

13

that comes into play.

14

MR. PINCUS:

But you're saying, no,

Just -- just, Your Honor,

15

as in the case of the question of whether a

16

contract delegates arbitrability to the

17

arbitrator.

18

would construe the clause to delegate -- would

19

construe the contract to make that delegation,

20

what First Options says is, no, that's not

21

enough.

If the state -- relevant state law

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

MR. PINCUS:

24
25

Right.

I'm not -­

We have to have clear and

unmistakable language.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'm just trying to get

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

a handle on what you're saying.

2

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- so you're saying

4

it's a federal rule.

5

is, where does the federal rule come from?

6

MR. PINCUS:

So I guess my question

I think it comes from

7

exactly the same place as the First Options

8

rule and -- and from the discussion of this

9

very issue in Stolt-Nielsen.

10

It's -- it's

constructive to look at Stolt-Nielsen.

11

I -- I understand, Your Honor, that -­

12

that -- that Stolt-Nielsen didn't decide the

13

content of the standard, but Stolt-Nielsen

14

talked about the fact that interpretation of an

15

arbitration agreement is generally a matter of

16

state law, and went on to talk about the fact

17

that the critical question in the FAA is that

18

contracts be interpreted according to their

19

terms, pointing to the language in Section 4,

20

and it concluded, it said, from these

21

principles it follows that a party may not be

22

compelled under the FAA to submit to class

23

arbitration unless there is a contractual basis

24

for concluding the party agreed to do so.

25

didn't -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Quite right.

So

2

Stolt-Nielsen said -- but Stolt-Nielsen was a

3

case where there clearly -- where the Court

4

specifically said there was no intent of the

5

parties, there was no agreement as to the

6

particular issue in front of it.

7

So, in my hypothetical where the -­

8

the -- the court is saying:

Well, under state

9

law, we would interpret this to understand that

10

there was an intent of the parties and that

11

there was an agreement as to this question,

12

you're saying, notwithstanding that

13

Stolt-Nielsen said that we didn't decide that

14

question, that a federal rule comes into play.

15

And I guess I'm going to ask the same

16

question because I don't think it comes from

17

Stolt-Nielsen, where there was no agreement at

18

all.

19

So where does the federal rule come from?
MR. PINCUS:

I think it comes from the

20

same place that the Moses Cone presumption

21

comes from and the First Options presumption,

22

the rule of clear and unmistakability comes

23

from, and the Howsam rule of clear and

24

unmistakable requirement comes from, which is

25

Section 4.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

What the Court has said is, with

2

respect to some critical questions, it wants -­

there is a federal rule of decision that comes

authority delegated to the arbitrator has, in

You're saying if

13

-- even if it's a questionable interpretation

14

of that statutory language, again, similar to

15

the last case with Justice Kagan's question,

16

the precedent, the ship has sailed?

17
18
19

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think the ship

has certainly sailed -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

In Stolt-Nielsen

20

-- in Stolt-Nielsen, at least you're saying the

21

ship's a long way -- a long way off -­

22

MR. PINCUS:

I think -- I think -­

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- because -­

24

because Stolt-Nielsen said that you needed

25

something on the order of express language or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

indicated or hinted at least is what you're

2

saying here?

3

MR. PINCUS:

I think it's impossible

4

to read the discussion on Stolt-Nielsen on

5

pages 681 to 685 and conclude anything other

6

than the fact that the court concluded there

7

that there was a federal rule of interpretation

8

that it didn't have to flesh -- it said at

9

Footnote 10, in fact, we don't have to decide

10

what that standard is because -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because the only

12

federal rule was that it needed to be based on

13

an agreement of the parties, because it said

14

arbitration is a matter of consent, and that's

15

all over the Arbitration Act.

16

But the question of how to understand

17

whether parties have consented, that's usually

18

a question of state law.

19

MR. PINCUS:

Except -­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you are saying a

21

federal rule should come in and say,

22

notwithstanding state law saying that these two

23

parties have agreed to something, the federal

24

rule under the Arbitration Act says no.

25

MR. PINCUS:

Well -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And usually what the

2

Federal Arbitration Act does is it -- it surely

3

does come into play when you're afraid that the

4

state law is discriminating against arbitration

5

agreements.

6

But where there is no such concern -­

7

and I don't think that there is such a concern

8

if the state -- if the state courts just say

9

we're going to treat general language as

10

including everything inside it -- then I don't

11

see where the federal law comes into play to

12

create a different contract interpretive rule.

13

MR. PINCUS:

Well, First Options and

14

Howsam were not concerned with discrimination.

15

They were concerned with being certain that

16

when significant power is being assigned to the

17

arbitrator, that the -- that there be clear and

18

unmistakable indication that that was the

19

parties' intent.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How can that -- how

21

can there be clear and unmistakable here?

22

Let's take Concepcion, where the concern was

23

that these arbitration agreements supposedly

24

based on consent were adhesion contracts, and

25

Concepcion said the court -- the court said

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

that the states remain free to take steps

2

addressing concerns attending adhesion

3

contracts.

4

that the class action waiver provision in

5

adhesion agreements be highlighted.

6

we don't even have a waiver provision.

7

One such step would be to require

But here

So Concepcion suggests waiver should

8

be highlighted so the party subjected to it

9

will understand that.

And here you're asking

10

us to declare clear -- clear and certain, a

11

provision that doesn't say class action -- we

12

waive class actions.

13

MR. PINCUS:

Well, this -- this might

14

be a different case if the question were

15

whether class actions are excluded from the

16

agreement.

17

This -- the -- the question here is whether

18

this extraordinary procedure called class

19

arbitration is going to be authorized.

20

And my friends haven't argued that.

And -- and so I think there the

21

question where we're talking about whether to

22

delegate that power to the arbitrator does

23

raise exactly the same concerns that motivated

24

the Court in these -- in these other contexts.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can -- can I go back

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

for a second to the procedural problem?

2

you're plaintiff and you bring a case, and you

3

say, Judge, I want you to send this to

4

arbitration, right?

5

no, Judge, we want you to decide the issue.

6

You -­

And the other side says,

That's a normal case.

And many, many

7

cases like that will have difficult issues,

8

like the one before us.

9

And so Section 3 of the arbitration

10

agreement seems to say what the judge is

11

supposed to do.

12

the trial, send it to arbitration, if you think

13

that's the result.

14

think there's a tough issue in this case, you

15

can always certify it.

16

parties thinks there's a tough issue and you

17

won't certify it, they can always ask for

18

mandamus.

19

this is one of them.

20

Judge, if you think -- stay

By the way, Judge, if you

And if one of the

That's like a million cases.

And

So, if the judge makes a mistake and

21

writes the word "dismissal" or if one of the

22

parties would really like to appeal even though

23

the judge has no reason for it, they can say,

24

Judge, write "dismiss"; and then he writes

25

"dismiss" and then suddenly it becomes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

appealable?

2

never been decided.

3

that's a threshold issue; maybe then we should

4

DIG the case.

5

I mean, you say, well, that's
I'd say, all right, but

MR. PINCUS:

Well, the -- the Court

6

did decide the issue in Randolph.

7

Randolph was in the same posture here, where

8

there was an order -­

9
10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, maybe we got it

wrong.

11

MR. PINCUS:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

And -- and

-- on arbitration.
Maybe it wasn't fully

argued and -­

14

MR. PINCUS:

Well, I think -­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- and then I just

16

don't see why we should treat this area of the

17

law when here, unlike the other areas, there is

18

Section 3.

19

MR. PINCUS:

Your Honor -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Why should we treat

21

it differently and suddenly reach a tough issue

22

when the statute seems to say don't?

23

MR. PINCUS:

Well, a couple of -- a

24

couple of answers.

I -- I think it's important

25

for the Court to reach the issue here because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

the reality is, if a case is sent to class

2

arbitration, it almost certainly is going to

3

settle.

4
5

The Court has talked a lot about the
coercive -- the -- the -­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. PINCUS:

That's true.

-- inexorable pressure to

8

settle in courts in class litigation.

Class

9

litigation in arbitration is 100 times worse

10

because of the very limited standard of review

11

at the other end.

12

So the reality is, if all cases were

13

stayed and the case could never be appealed at

14

this stage, the question of what the standard

15

is for deciding whether a contract authorizing

16

class arbitration is would never be decided.

17

There is a conflict right now in the

18

courts of appeals about whether dismissal is a

19

permissible -- is a permissible step after a

20

court has ordered arbitration or whether a stay

21

is only permissible.

22

The Court could certainly grant one of

23

those petitions and decide it.

24

irony -­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The -- the

But if that -- if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

that were -- were the case, that the district

2

court has no authority to dismiss, must simply

3

stay the case in court, would you agree that

4

that is not a final judgment, there's no

5

appeal?

6

MR. PINCUS:

Well, the Court addressed

7

this question in Randolph, which, as I say, was

8

in this posture, and said that the fact that -­

9

the -- the question whether the district court

10

had the power to dismiss, A, was not before it

11

and did not preclude it from hearing the case.

12

I think if the -- if this Court were

13

to hold that a stay was -- was the only

14

permissible option, then, obviously, there

15

wouldn't be an appeal.

16

are many, many cases in which dismissals are

17

ordered and which there are appeals.

18

irony of this case, frankly, is the shoes are

19

on the other foot.

20

But, as I say, there

And the

Typically, what happens is arbitration

21

is ordered, especially in the Ninth Circuit.

22

Plaintiffs seek dismissal so they can

23

immediately appeal the arbitration order.

And

24

in the Ninth Circuit, that's permissible.

And,

25

typically, defendants resist that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28

2

So that's just a -- an issue that
is -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

In how many of

4

those cases -- in how many of those cases is -­

5

in this case, the Respondents did not ask for a

6

stay, correct?

7

MR. PINCUS:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

seems permissive.

10

a stay.

11

correct?

True.
And so the statute

It says if a party asks for

But there wasn't a request for one,

12

MR. PINCUS:

I believe that's right.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And in those Ninth

14

Circuit cases, even if there's a request for a

15

stay -­

16

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. PINCUS:

-- they hold -­

The Ninth Circuit takes

19

the position that the district court has the

20

option of whether or not to dismiss or stay.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it then gives

22

the district court the power to decide what's

23

appealable or not?

24

MR. PINCUS:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

If you just had -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

if you just had the statute and not

2

Stolt-Nielsen or the other precedents you've

3

cited, in response to Justice Kagan's question,

4

how would you answer where does it come from?

5

MR. PINCUS:

I -- I would still say

6

that it -- it comes from the language of the

7

statute, which says -­

8
9
10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Which -- which

language?
MR. PINCUS:

-- in accordance -- shall

11

make an order directing the parties to proceed

12

to arbitration, in accordance with the terms of

13

the agreement, and that some issues confer some

14

-- some decisions confer such power on the

15

arbitrator that federal law -- before federal

16

law confers that power on the arbitrator,

17

federal law wants to be very sure that -- that

18

the parties have intended that result.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Mr. Pincus,

20

could one read that same language as suggesting

21

not that the district court gets the

22

opportunity to decide the nature of the

23

arbitration but merely whether there's an

24

agreement to arbitrate and that procedures like

25

class or individualized proceedings are not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

within the scope of what Section 4 contemplates

2

and that the error here is really that the

3

district court shouldn't have gotten in the

4

business of specifying the procedures that

5

would be followed in arbitration?

6

MR. PINCUS:

Well, many -- many

7

arbitration agreements expressly allocate the

8

authority to decide this question to the -- to

9

the arbitrator because it is such -- to the

10

court, rather, because it's such an important

11

question.

12
13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, I understand

that -­

14

MR. PINCUS:

This -- this case -­

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- but that would

16

then come within the context of the -- of the

17

statutory language, is there an agreement to

18

arbitrate.

19

here.

20

But that's not the language we have

MR. PINCUS:

No.

But the parties

21

submitted the question to the district court.

22

I think they essentially agreed that -- that it

23

was appropriate for the district court to

24

decide it.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

One quick one,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

Mr. Pincus.

2

not necessarily argue for a clear statement

3

rule.

4

argument below.

5

You say in your brief that you do

You agree that you didn't make that

So what language, short of a clear

6

statement, would lead you to conclude that this

7

agreement was intended to authorize class

8

arbitration?

9
10
11

MR. PINCUS:

That it was not intended

to authorize class -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I mean what would

12

be enough for you to switch your position,

13

essentially?

14

you say a clear statement rule isn't required,

15

but, you know, what -- what kind of language

16

would say, ah, I can see that the parties

17

agreed to class arbitration there?

18

Like if this -- if this -- if -­

MR. PINCUS:

If there wasn't the

19

provision that I read and the -- the agreement

20

simply said we agree that we can bring any

21

lawsuits that we could bring against one

22

another in court.

23

language than there is here, which talks about

24

claims, which talks about my claims, and the

25

only place that lawsuits is talked about is the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Ms. Vercoski.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MICHELE M. VERCOSKI

9

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

10
11

MS. VERCOSKI:

Yes, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

12

In this case, were the court within

13

the appellate jurisdiction and thus properly

14

before this Court, this Court should rule that

15

the FAA does not preempt the application of

16

neutral state contract principles to determine

17

whether an arbitration agreement permits

18

arbitration here.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the

20

question really is whether they're neutral

21

principles.

22

argument is that applying these principles has

23

a peculiar impact on arbitration agreements

24

since it authorizes a type of arbitration that

25

is -- is like a poison pill that basically said

As I understand it, the -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

in prior cases is fundamentally inconsistent

2

with arbitration.

3

MS. VERCOSKI:

Right.

But they have

4

said in -- in -- in espousing the -- the policy

5

rule that the default might be bilateral

6

arbitration.

7

is, first and foremost, we have to construe the

8

contract and give intent to the parties.

9

that is consistent with the FAA.

10

But what gives precedence to that

And

And a class arbitration, as to whether

11

or not that applies in a class arbitration

12

agreement, is not the same as the issue of

13

arbitrability and doesn't rise to a special

14

standard.

15

application of contract principles to determine

16

the parties' intent as to what they applied

17

with class arbitration.

18

So what's left is just the

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Nowadays, many

19

arbitration contracts, many adhesion contracts,

20

do put in explicit class action waivers.

21

-- let's say you're right.

22

very much, are we, because contracts will

23

specifically say that class action is waived?

24
25

MS. VERCOSKI:

So if

We're not doing

If that is the case,

Your Honor, and it is clear and explicit that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

there is a class action waiver, then, yes, the

2

parties' intent has to rule out under contract

3

rules.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So if -- if, as I

5

suggested before, if we say that, then all the

6

parties who want to arbitrate bilaterally will

7

simply put in their contract a class action is

8

waived and the party to that adhesion contract

9

can't do anything about that.

10

MS. VERCOSKI:

They can't do anything

11

about that if that's clear and unmistakable,

12

and so we have to give intent to the parties.

13

And at the same token, if the parties did agree

14

to proceed with class arbitration, that too

15

under the FAA would be required to enforce the

16

parties' intent.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So, here, where the

18

concern is lawyers that are less than the best

19

and didn't put in a class action waiver,

20

those -- those contracts, in those cases, class

21

arbitration will be permitted?

22

MS. VERCOSKI:

Well, it depends on the

23

language of the -- of the actual agreement.

24

And to the extent that the terms speak to class

25

arbitration, even if it's not explicit, we have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

to determine the difference between whether

2

it's silent and whether there's something there

3

that supports a class arbitration, whether or

4

not it's explicit with the words class

5

arbitration.

6

And in order to do that, the norm

7

under the FAA is that we employ neutral

8

contract interpretation principles, like we

9

would to all contracts to determine what the

10

parties' intent was with respect to class

11

arbitration.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I

13

mean, it's, I guess, Justice Jackson's phrase,

14

I mean, the FAA is not a suicide pact.

15

the FAA says enforce the contracts according to

16

its terms, but one of the terms, as our prior

17

precedents say, is fundamentally inconsistent

18

with arbitration itself, then, presumably, the

19

FAA would preclude that term.

20

MS. VERCOSKI:

So, if

Yes, that would be an

21

exception to the normal rule because that is

22

elevated and -- and the FAA had determined

23

that, first and foremost, that the policy

24

overrides that we want to enforce arbitration

25

agreements, to the extent they're ambiguous,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

unlike the normal rule, when interpreting

2

ancillary issues with respect to that

3

agreement, when it comes to arbitration, issues

4

of arbitrability, the default rule is they are

5

construed in -- in favor of arbitration.

6

that's consistent with the FAA's doctrine.

7
8
9
10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

And

The FAA has rules

that govern class arbitration, don't they?
MS. VERCOSKI:

They do, but it's not

federal common rule that supplants -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, no, I'm just

12

saying this is an arbitration association and

13

the arbitration association has rules governing

14

class arbitration, so they must not see class

15

arbitration as a poison pill.

16

that class arbitration has a place at least in

17

some cases.

18

MS. VERCOSKI:

They must think

Correct, to the extent

19

that the parties did agree to -- to do so.

20

that agreement has to -­

21
22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
thought the -­

23

MR. VERCOSKI:

24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

25

Well, I

-- be enforced.
I thought

those same rules specify that the rules

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

themselves do not provide a basis for assuming

2

there's class arbitration.

3

MS. VERCOSKI:

There's no assumption

4

one way or the other.

What happens is that the

5

courts have to construe based on state contract

6

law principles that determine what the

7

objective intent was of the parties at the time

8

of enforcing the agreement.

9

terms are given -- the terms of the contract

And the plain

10

are given their plain and ordinary meaning.

11

And that -- that is the first step.

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, if -- if

13

this is enough, this contract under ordinary

14

and plain state law principles where it often

15

in the text speaks of my claims and me and I -­

16

MS. VERCOSKI:

Right.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- if -- if that's

18

enough, what do we do with the due process

19

problem that Justice Alito pointed out in

20

Oxford Health where you would have potentially

21

class members purportedly bound by an

22

arbitration, this is in a court of law, where

23

we can adjudicate absent class members rights

24

consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment

25

because of the procedural protections

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

associated with court proceedings.

2

What do we do about those absent class

3

members in opt-out classes permitted by

4

whatever arbitrable forum's rules prevail?

5

MS. VERCOSKI:

Well, first of all, the

6

-- the policy issues with respect to due

7

process are outside of the question presented.

8

But even if this Court were to consider those,

9

this is an antecedent question.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Should we -- should

11

we ignore them in considering the impact here

12

of the Arbitration Act and normal contract

13

principles and whether normal contract

14

principles would abide due process, for

15

example?

16

MS. VERCOSKI:

The -- to the extent

17

that due process concerns come into play,

18

that's at a much later stage of the game.

19

is at issue here is we simply have a -­

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Well, what happens

21

in the -- in the arbitration?

22

a class.

23

notice to all the class members.

24
25

What

So suppose it's

If it were in court, there would be

Would that have to be done in the
arbitration, notice -- give notice to everyone

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1
2

who was within the class?
MS. VERCOSKI:

Right.

So, at first,

3

with our agreement here, the court, the

4

district court just found that the agreement

5

provides for a class arbitration and -- and

6

goes to the arbitrator to determine whether or

7

not that will ultimately be certified.

8
9

So the antecedent question of the
court finding that the agreement here provides

10

language that encompasses and anticipates and

11

allows the parties to go forward with

12

arbitration, which will now go to the

13

arbitrator to decide, and they are subject to

14

the same exact rules as a court of law when

15

determining whether or not they're going to

16

certify that class.

17

And -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But do you think that

18

-- that absent class members who didn't agree

19

to arbitration could be bound by the decision

20

of the arbitrator?

21

MS. VERCOSKI:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

MS. VERCOSKI:

Yes, they can.
How?
Because down -- if they

24

do decide to certify the class, they could

25

employ the same due process protections, such

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

as opt-out procedures.

2

absent class member will have the opportunity

And at the end of the day, the -­

there is a review process.

JUSTICE ALITO:

And at that point, an

Well, if they have a

8

legal claim, how can they be deprived of their

9

legal claim pursuant to an arbitration award if

10

they never agreed to arbitration?

11

arbitration was a matter of contract.

12

MS. VERCOSKI:

I thought

Well, in the first

13

instance, it's a matter of contract right as to

14

whether or not the contract actually will

15

permit the proceedings.

Now the -- the arbitrator might get

There is no way to certify the

So then we're back to individual

So that's why this is a very premature

question.

And due process concerns are not

23

related to the antecedent question as to

24

whether or not construing this particular

arbitration agreement by the court, all she's

saying is not ultimately that it is

certifiable.

3

the contract does support that the issue of

4

whether or not the class can be certified goes

5

to the arbitrator for ultimate decision.

She's just saying that it is -­

So the due process concerns are not

involved in the first instance in just a strict

contract interpretation.

10

they will be.

There are no

JUSTICE ALITO:

made by the arbitrator that can be appealable

by either side depending on the outcome.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

23

Well, under an

extraordinarily deferential standard of review.
MS. VERCOSKI:

For the arbitrator,

yes, for -- for their decision on class

arbitration.

But like in this case, the order

So why did you let

So why did you let

the court decide that issue?
MS. VERCOSKI:

We wanted the court to

14

decide the issue because, in the beginning, we

15

were also questioning the issue of

16

arbitrability as to whether or not the data

17

breach claims that we were alleging even fell

18

within the -- in the scope of the arbitration

19

agreement.

20

decided below.

21

And the issue of arbitrability was

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it seems to

22

me -- I'm not quite sure why you did what you

23

did, but it seems to me that that would have

24

been clearly for the arbitrators under the

25

terms of this contract because it's related to

-- it -­

2

MS. VERCOSKI:

The arbitrator -- yes,

the agreement at issue definitely did have a

delegation clause that gave the ability for the

5

arbitrator to decide these decisions.

7

Varela, the issues of -- it wasn't just the

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MS. VERCOSKI:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

When it

-- issue involved.
-- class action is

a procedural process.

13

MS. VERCOSKI:

Correct.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And, in my mind,

15

that quintessentially is always an arbitrator's

16

question, what -- when you hold the hearings,

17

how you hold them, where.

18

are typically arbitrator decisions.

19

seems to me that under normal circumstances you

20

wouldn't have a court decide that, so I think

21

Justice Gorsuch's earlier point, but here

22

instead you chose the court to make that

23

decision.

24
25

MS. VERCOSKI:
did.

All of those things

Right.

So it

Both parties

Nobody objected.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And what is the

2

context of that then?

order class arbitration.

4

bound by that?

5

the rules are -- are not met in -- under the

6

FAA rules that are required for class actions,

7

can -- is he -- is he forbidden from proceeding

8

with individualized proceedings nonetheless?

9

So the court says that I
Is the arbitrator

If the arbitrator finds that

Does he -- is he forbidden from

10

engaging in the normal kind of inquiry as to

11

whether a class would be superior or preferable

12

in some way than I assume the FAA rules have

13

some -- some analogue to?

14

MS. VERCOSKI:

15

incorporated within -­

16

They do.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So the rules

So -- so is -- is

17

the arbitrator forbidden from making those

18

inquiries by this ruling?

19

MS. VERCOSKI:

It -- the way that the

20

JAMS and the AAA class arbitration issues are

21

drafted, they say that whether a court decided

22

the threshold issue as to whether the contract

23

provided a basis to permit the class -- to -­

24

to permit the parties to go on a class

25

arbitration basis, that doesn't stop the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

inquiry.

2

So it -- it appears from the rules

3

that the arbitrator has to give deference to

4

that initial threshold ruling, but that doesn't

5

mean that they have to ultimately certify the

6

class.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So -- so why are we

MS. VERCOSKI:

It doesn't mean the -­

I

11

mean, if at the end of the day we're going to

12

have this large dispute in district court over

13

whether the contract permits this or that

14

procedure, I mean, are we going to have

15

disputes over whether it permits discovery?

16

And that's a contract issue that the parties

17

negotiated?

18

might be allowed or disallowed in a -- in an

19

arbitration proceeding?

20

collateral expense and -- and difficulty that

21

seems kind of a little inconsistent with the

22

idea of getting to arbitration quickly and that

23

the district court proceedings are supposed to

be summary.

4

So -- so we were fine proceeding on a class

basis and were ready to go to arbitration.

6

Lamps Plus fought that and issued a stay

7

because they didn't agree with the way -- they

8

didn't get the -- what they wanted in asking

9

for the order to compel -- compel arbitration.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

11

MS. VERCOSKI:

Suppose that you -­

They got -- they got

12

their order compelling it, but they -- they

13

didn't like that it wasn't limited to an

individual basis.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose you -­

16

suppose the district court dismissed your court

17

claims and then ordered bilateral arbitration.

18

Would you have an appeal?

19

MS. VERCOSKI:

I would not.

It would

20

be interlocutory, and it would be barred by FAA

21

Section 16.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Where you would be

23

stuck with what -- whatever the -- if the court

24

said bilateral, you have no appeal; if it says

25

class action, the other side, you say also has

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

no appeal?

2

MS. VERCOSKI:

On that particular

3

issue alone in that order, isolated, looking at

4

the order to compel arbitration, yes, I

5

wouldn't have a basis.

6

in conjunction with an order dismissing my

7

claims on a -- with -- on prejudice or without

8

prejudice, then that would be a final ruling

9

against me that would be an aggrievance to my

But if it was ordered

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

MS. VERCOSKI:

But you would have a

15

final -- under Randolph.

16

fit with -- with under Randolph and I would

17

have a basis because that motion to dismiss

18

would be final and allow me to appeal under

19

16(a)(3) under the FAA, and the basis for that

20

would be the incorrect ruling on the -- the

21

district court ordering me into -- to compel

22

arbitration.

23

That would -- I would

So I would have a basis for that.

Unlike Lamps Plus, they could not turn

24

a non-appealable issue all the way into an

25

appealable issue because they're the ones who

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

asked the court to order the -- the dismissal

2

of my client's claims.

3

Initially, they did it with prejudice

4

below, and they got it without prejudice.

5

if that were a stay instead like, arguably, the

6

FAA requires under Section 3, that if you are

7

ordering the claims to proceed to -- to

8

arbitration, it should -- actually, the

9

language says it "shall" issue a stay instead

10
11

And

of a dismissal without prejudice.
But, if we have the stay, it wouldn't

12

be a final order.

13

reversed and I had -- I was challenging the

14

order compelling arbitration in -- in

15

conjunction with a final order dismissing my

16

claims, I would be aggrieved because now I'm -­

17

I'm out of those claims.

But if -- if it were

JUSTICE ALITO:

So, counsel, if

19

there's a contract between two businesses, and

20

business A drafts the contract, business B

21

accepts the contract, there's nothing in the

22

contract about arbitration, but a state court

23

-- but it turns out that A, which -- the party

24

that drafted the contract, doesn't want

25

arbitration.

B, the party that did not draft

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

the contract, does want arbitration.

There's

2

no -- no arbitration clause in the contract.

3

But the state court says contra proferentem,

4

this goes to arbitration; that's state law.

5

Would that be permitted?

6

MS. VERCOSKI:

That the -- that it

7

would err on the side of not finding for

8

arbitration because it would be construed

9

against the drafter who was -­

10
11

JUSTICE ALITO:

It would err on the

side of -­

12

MS. VERCOSKI:

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- doing the proposing?
-- finding arbitration

14

because the -- the -- it was -- it was drafted

15

by the party that objects to arbitration.

16

MS. VERCOSKI:

So, in that case, there

17

is a special rule under the FAA that, instead

18

of construing it against a drafter, the FAA

19

trumps that situation where you have to

20

construe it in favor of arbitrability.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

This is -­
This is -- this would

be a decision in favor of arbitrability.

24

MS. VERCOSKI:

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Right.
So what's the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

difference between that situation and the

2

situation here?

3

MS. VERCOSKI:

4

a decision issuing a -­

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, the -- there was

In other words, if

6

state law -- if state law governs, that's the

7

decision under state law in this hypothetical,

8

there must be arbitration even in the absence

9

of any arbitration clause whatsoever.

10
11
12

That's

state law.
So that would be -- would that be
consistent with the -- allowed under the FAA?

13

MS. VERCOSKI:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

It would be -­
And if not, doesn't

15

that show that the FAA imposes some rules that

16

super -- that supersede state law?

17

MS. VERCOSKI:

Right.

Well, if it's

18

consistent with the way the state law came out

19

and found in favor of arbitration, then it

20

wouldn't be in conflict with the FAA.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

Here is the problem

22

like that that I'm having:

All that you have

23

in the California law, all we have here is the

24

contract says in lieu of any and all lawsuits

25

we're going to have arbitration.

Okay?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

And then it says claims will be

2

arbitrated if there are claims that would have

3

been available as a matter of law.

4

other than that.

5
6

Nothing

And -­

MS. VERCOSKI:

In the contract at

issue?

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

In the contract at

8

issue, I gather.

And -- and then, on the basis

9

of that, California, unlike most places, which

10

insist on more than that to create ambiguity,

11

say that's enough to create ambiguity and,

12

therefore, we have class arbitration.

13
14

Now what is my problem?
in Stolt-Nielsen.

I dissented

I think I did.

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I

17

lost.

18

said was you cannot infer class authorization

19

solely from the fact of the parties' agreement

20

to arbitrate.

21

If I did, I lost.

I'm not sure.

And what the majority

So, on the merits, what they're saying

22

is, hey, that's all you have here.

And

23

California says that's -- they have a special

24

rule, unlike any other place, that's enough to

25

create ambiguity and ambiguity against the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

drafter.

2

Well, if that's enough to create

3

ambiguity and ambiguity against the drafter,

4

then we have what Stolt-Nielsen says you

5

shouldn't have.

6

overrule Stolt-Nielsen.

7

too far.

Now I could say we should

8

(Laughter.)

9

MS. VERCOSKI:

10

I think I won't get

JUSTICE BREYER:

Uh-huh.
And so we have the

11

case right there with the language.

12

the California language in the contract.

13

MS. VERCOSKI:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

We have

Right.
And we have a special

15

rule, which is their right, I guess, that we

16

find ambiguity there, though the textbooks say

17

don't, okay?

18

So that's the main point on the merits

19

as I see it.

20

because I want to know your response.

21

And I'm asking the question

MS. VERCOSKI:

Well, first of all, in

22

Stolt-Nielsen, they did not interpret the

23

agreement's language at all.

24

there was an agreement, a side agreement

25

between the parties that expressly stated that

They said that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

we have no agreement on class arbitration.

2

So we're not even going to look at the

3

contract.

4

the arbitrators found that class arbitration

5

applied simply on policy basis.

6

They gave it to the arbitrators and

This is not the contract here.

There

7

absolutely are provisions that support -- they

8

are very broad and they -- they encompass class

9

proceedings.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem I have

11

is the following, because it -- it's following

12

up on Justice Alito's question, okay?

13

There are at least two or three

14

California lower courts and at least one court

15

of appeals who have seen contracts almost

16

identical to this -­

17

MS. VERCOSKI:

Yes.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- and said,

19

contrary to the lower court, to the lower court

20

here, to the Ninth Circuit, that that language

21

is not enough to have a foothold in the

22

contract under California law, because the

23

words "the waiver of all lawsuits or other

24

civil legal proceedings," you have to submit

25

everything to arbitration, don't say anything

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

about the nature, the procedural nature, of

2

that arbitration.

That's been their reasoning.

3

And they look at all of the I's and my

4

claims of this contract and say that shows just

5

a bilateral intent.

6

MS. VERCOSKI:

Yes, it -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And so those

8

courts, unlike the court here, is basically

9

saying that the court below misapplied state

10

law.

11

Now are we supposed to give deference

12

to the state court on its interpretation of

13

state law, or are we supposed to check to make

14

sure that they are, in fact, following state

15

law?

16
17

MS. VERCOSKI:
an issue here because -­

18
19

Well, that's not even

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it is an

issue -­

20

MS. VERCOSKI:

Well, it's an issue -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- because, if

22

this contract doesn't speak at all, there's no

23

foothold.

24
25

MS. VERCOSKI:
does.

Our contract absolutely

The contracts that the -- that Lamps

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56

Plus cited is from two appellate courts and the

2

state court, and their language was very

3

limited and not even nearly as broad as our

4

provisions.

5
6
7

And we have -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

So what's the best

statement in the contract that supports you?
MS. VERCOSKI:

In our contract, the

8

very best one is arbitration shall be in lieu

9

of any and all lawsuits or civil legal

10

proceedings relating to my employment.

11

arbitration will be in lieu of a set of actions

12

that includes class actions and allows for

13

class actions.

14

That

And the language, when contrasted with

15

the language of the state appellate courts,

16

they were limited specifically to the -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

My problem with

18

that is arbitration isn't law proceedings by

19

definition.

20

here, but by nature, the discovery rules in

21

arbitration, a procedural issue, are different

22

than a lawsuit.

23

interrogatories.

24

procedurally.

25

You did have some discovery rules

So are notice requirements and
Everything's different

Why are you thinking that class action

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57

proceedings are -- are a special proceeding

2

that you're entitled to bring somewhere else?

3

MS. VERCOSKI:

Well, I'm not thinking

4

that it's special.

5

extent that the parties have it in their

6

contract, we have to give their intent, first

7

and foremost, the -- the equal -- we have to

8

enforce it under the FAA.

9

I'm thinking that to the

That's their overarching principle, is

10

that we look at the intent and we enforce the

11

contracts according to their intent.

12

So those two lower state contract

13

interpretations, they didn't find ambiguity at

14

all.

15

into the individual claims that were able to be

16

brought by that individual only with respect to

17

his employment against his employer and vice

18

versa.

19

The language there was much more limiting

Our phrases are far more sweeping

20

where Mr. Varela assented to "waiver of any

21

right I may have to file" a legal -- "a lawsuit

22

or civil legal proceeding relating to my

employment with the company."

To the extent he has claims out of the

data breach, that encompasses claims of -- of

4

other workers that were subject to the same set

5

of circumstances.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, it doesn't.

7

No, he's granted that right as a procedural

right in the lawsuit.

9

here is, is he entitled to that in an

The operative question

11

MS. VERCOSKI:

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

He absolutely is.
That's a separate

--

14

MS. VERCOSKI:

Because the word

15

"proceeding" is extremely broad and it includes

16

legal actions or procedures.

17

arbitration or a class action is absolutely a

18

proceeding.

19

A civil

disputes, a class action is a controversy or a

dispute.

brought now has to be brought in arbitration.

24

And it doesn't say that those claims cannot be

25

or that they are waived from -- from being

And anything that was supposed to be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59

brought in arbitration.

2

And the fact that it's -- you know,

3

the -- Lamps Plus argues that there is

4

bilateral language that I, me, my employment,

5

that doesn't -- it doesn't modify the term "my

6

individual employment" or my "individual

7

claims."

8

of different claims that arise out of this

9

employment, including the data breach.

10

"My employment" encompasses all kinds

And because whatever Mr. Varela could

11

bring in a court of law individually, he is

12

entitled to also bring those claims on a

class-wide basis in arbitration, because "in

14

lieu of" means a set of actions that could have

15

been brought in a court of law, now have to be

16

brought into arbitration.

17

And that does not limit his right to

18

bringing the proceedings on an aggregate basis.

19

That doesn't change the nature of the claims or

20

the parties' rights.

21

is the way that the proceedings are processed

22

in arbitration.

23

The only thing it changes

And it doesn't stop there.

The

24

language goes even broader to encompass all

25

remedies that could have been issued in a court

of law.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Class action is

not a remedy.

4

MS. VERCOSKI:

No, class action's not

5

a remedy, but remedies can be awarded and are

awarded through class actions.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

To other people, but

there's nothing that prohibits him from

employment, it doesn't say his employment and

14

that includes, and only includes, his

15

individual claims relating to his employment.

16

When they said arising out of his

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Counsel, in -- the

17

dissenting judge below said that the Ninth

18

Circuit's decision was a palpable evasion of

19

Stolt-Nielsen.

20

Breyer's question, who asked you how you would

21

distinguish Stolt-Nielsen, you said, one, the

22

court there did not interpret the agreements

23

language at all.

24
25

And picking up on Justice

Is there anything else you'd like to
add to how you would distinguish Stolt-Nielsen?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

MS. VERCOSKI:

Absolutely.

We are on

2

all fours with Stolt-Nielsen because what

3

Stolt-Nielsen said expressly was what we need

4

is a contractual basis in order to find that

5

the parties intended to proceed on the class

6

arbitration basis.

7

And it doesn't say that it needs to

8

say class arbitration expressly, so there we

9

have a -- we have a situation versus silent and

10

expressly.

11

what supplies that contractual basis is the

12

daylight in between that.

13

And what we're trying to look for,

And if we look at Oxford Health, the

14

-- the arbitrator there was permitted to

15

construe the -- to construe the arbitration

16

agreement just by looking at the contract

17

language.

18

And although on review they had to

19

give him deference, they -- they stated that

20

they might not have agreed with his

21

interpretation, but if we were going to go with

22

a clear and unmistakable new policy that Lamps

23

Plus wants this Court to adopt, then

24

Stolt-Nielsen -- sorry, Oxford Health would

25

have been completely erroneous.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF ANDREW J. PINCUS

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

11

13

Thank you.

Mr. Pincus.

9

12

Thank you,

counsel.

8

Thank you.

MR. PINCUS:
Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Just a couple of points.
Justice Breyer mentioned that -- the

14

AAA rules on class arbitration.

15

number of decisions, hundreds of decisions

16

reported on the AAA website.

17

eight that are decisions that go to the merits.

18

There are a

There are only

Five approved settlements.

One is a

19

dismissal.

20

And there's one for the plaintiff.

21

really, for -- for all the years that class

22

arbitrations have been in process, they really

23

haven't produced a lot at the end of the line.

24
25

One is in favor of the defendant.
So they

Justice Gorsuch raised the due process
issue, and I think that's another reason why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

63
1

the clear and unmistakable standard makes

2

sense.

3

standard applied below were allowed to -- to

4

prevail, then the class arbitration would

5

proceed.

6

There's a serious risk that if the

Let's say the defendant won.

Then

7

every class member would then argue in the

8

future, when the defendant sought to enforce

9

that judgment, I didn't agree to class

10

arbitration, so I'm not bound by that judgment.

11

A clear and unmistakable -- and certainly -­

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Wouldn't they be

13

bound if they got notice and an opportunity to

14

opt out?

15

MR. PINCUS:

I think there are serious

16

questions that were pointed out by Justice

17

Alito in -- in his Oxford Health dissent about

18

whether an arbitration to which they didn't

19

consent could bind them, especially if they

20

could prevail on an argument that the

21

arbitration agreement did not provide for class

22

arbitration.

23

That would be their argument.

And,

24

ironically, the defendant would then be arguing

25

for class arbitration.

The -- the class -- a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

putative class member would say no, and the

2

putative class member would say you should

3

construe the ambiguous agreement against me by

4

saying there's no -- there's no arbitration.

5

So that's another reason why we think

6

the clear and unmistakable standard makes

7

sense.

8
9

Justice Gorsuch, you asked about
whether the arbitrator would be bound by the

10

district court's decision.

The arbitrator's

11

bound under Rule 1(c) of the AAA rules by the

12

decision that the arbitration agreement

13

authorizes class arbitration.

14

Obviously, the arbitrator then would

15

have to go through the process to see whether

16

the rules for certifying a class were met, but

17

he couldn't or she couldn't contradict the

18

court's determination that class arbitration

19

was authorized.

20

And -- and then just -- my friend

21

relies -- places a lot of reliance on the "in

22

lieu of" sentence in the agreement, but what

23

that says is what arbitration is instead of.

24

It doesn't say what can be arbitrated.

25

And what can be arbitrated is covered

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65

by the claims covered by the arbitration

2

provision, and that's the provision that has

3

the I's and the my's.

4

Unless the Court has any further
questions.
