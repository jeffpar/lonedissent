(10:05 a.m.)
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

4

argument first this morning in Case 17-290,

5

Merck Sharp & Dohme versus Albrecht.

6

Mr. Dvoretzky.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. DVORETZKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
Respondents' express theory is that

12

the FDA, fully informed of the risk of atypical

13

femoral fractures, ignored that risk and its

14

own statutory and regulatory responsibilities

15

because it didn't like the way Merck phrased

16

its proposed warning.

17

That cannot be right.

If a

18

manufacturer, as Merck did here, informs the

19

FDA of a possible risk and unsuccessfully asks

20

to revise its label in light of that risk, then

21

failure to warn claims based on that risk are

22

preempted as a matter of law.

23

That rule follows from the statutory

24

and regulatory framework governing the FDA's

25

conduct and from the presumption of regularity.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

The presumption of regularity, of course,

2

assumes that federal agencies do their jobs

3

correctly.

4

The FDA's job in this case includes

5

protecting the public health by working with

6

manufacturers to revise drug labels when

7

necessary.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Dvoretzky, let me

give you a -- a -- a hypothetical because I

10

think we can -- could all agree that if you had

11

proposed a warning, let -- let me just say

12

major -- major fractures versus stress

13

fractures, and if you had proposed a warning

14

that dealt with major fractures and the FDA had

15

said no, we don't think that the literature

16

supports that, then there's nothing you can do,

17

and you should be immune from any suit.

18

I think that that's pretty clear.

The

19

question is sort of, you know, did -- did you

20

propose a different kind of warning?

21

give you a hypothetical.

22

So let me

Suppose that you manufacture a drug

23

and there's some evidence, whether it's enough,

24

hard to know, but there's some evidence that it

25

causes ovarian cancer, and you, the drug

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

manufacturer, proposes a warning to the FDA,

2

but instead of saying that the drug causes

3

ovarian cancer, you say it causes ovarian

4

cysts.

5

Now ovarian cysts are nothing that

6

anybody wants to have, but they're an

7

inconvenience.

8

And the FDA says:

9

that's the issue at all.

10

They're not ovarian cancer.
No, we don't think that

Does that mean that you're off the

11

hook now with respect to revising your label to

12

say that your product causes ovarian cancer?

13

MR. DVORETZKY:

I don't think that

14

you're necessarily off the hook in that

15

situation because you haven't warned about the

16

relevant risk.

17

question that Merck did warn about the relevant

18

risk.

But, in our case, there's no

19

The United States has told us that

20

that is how the FDA understood the warning.

21

The Third Circuit acknowledged that Merck

22

proposed to warn about atypical femoral

23

fractures.

24

in which this warning came about.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And you have to look at the context

Okay.

So that makes

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

it a much smaller case, right?

That we can

2

agree on things on either side.

3

that if the FDA said to you, you don't have to

4

warn about major fractures, you are off the

5

hook.

6

the FDA rejected a warning that had nothing to

7

do with the thing that was really at risk,

8

you're not off the hook.

We can agree

9

And on the other hand, we can agree if

And then the whole question boils down

10

to what was your proposal, what was their

11

response, were you both talking about the same

12

things?

13

about major risks?

14

proposal and say they're not talking about

15

major fractures; they're only talking about

16

stress fractures; and there's no reason to

17

think that stress fractures are a real risk and

18

no reason to put that in the label.

19

In other words, were you both talking
Or did the FDA look at your

MR. DVORETZKY:

I don't think that's

20

quite right, Justice Kagan, because you have to

21

look not only at the warning that was proposed

22

but also at the information that was in front

23

of the FDA about the risk.

24
25

And this is where, again, the FDA's
complete response letter has to be understood

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

in light of the FDA's statutory obligations.

2

Under 355(o)(4), the -- the Secretary is

3

obligated, if it believes that something should

4

be include in the label -- included in the

5

label of the warning, it shall promptly have a

6

back and forth with the manufacturer about

7

that.

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, but, you see,

10

MR. DVORETZKY:

And so --

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- that's the reason I

9

that's --

12

asked that question about the ovarian cancer

13

and the ovarian cysts, because I think you

14

could say on a -- on something like that, well,

15

look, it's true that our -- our proposal talked

16

about ovarian cysts, but we gave them all of

17

this data, and if they had really looked at all

18

of the data, they would have seen that it -- it

19

-- there's a real risk of -- of causing ovarian

20

cancer, and the fact that they didn't tell us

21

immediately to change our label means that

22

we're exempt from suit.

23

And I would think that that is not a

24

good understanding of the statute.

The idea

25

that they have to look through all of your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

data, even though you pinpoint an entirely

2

different risk, in order to find out what the

3

real risk is, and -- and that if they don't

4

manage to do that, you're exempt from suit,

5

that seems to me a very counterintuitive

6

reading of the statute and, indeed, not just

7

counterintuitive, it seems to conflict with the

8

-- the statutory provision, the rule of

9

construction that says that manufacturers have

10
11

primary responsibility over their labels.
MR. DVORETZKY:

And for that reason, I

12

think that would be a different and more

13

difficult case than the one that we have here.

14

But, here, the complete response letter has to

15

be understood both in light of what it says but

16

also against the backdrop of the FDA's

17

regulatory duties and the back and forth that

18

the FDA --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why?

Please point

20

me to where in the complete response letter you

21

say that they were -- thought stress fractures

22

were the same as the atypical fractures.

23

I'm reading the response letter, it's -- and --

24

and this is what they said to you:

25

that word -- fractures that have been reported

5

in the literature.

7

and is not adequately supported by the

8

available literature.

9

May not

Discussion of the risk

Nowhere did they say that the atypical

10

fractures are not supported by the literature,

11

and nowhere did they say don't change it.

12

rest of the letter tells you make changes and

13

we'll come back and talk more about this.

14

The

I look at their argument that the

15

conversation that your person had with them was

16

saying to them:

17

Now come back with something else, and maybe

18

we'll give you what you want; maybe we won't.

19

But I don't think, from the complete response

20

letter, if you're a textualist, that you can

21

look at it and say that they were saying no to

22

an atypical fracture warning.

23

certainly saying no to a stress warning.

24
25

We're thinking about this.

They were

So read me something in the complete
response letter, from that letter standing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

4

alone, that you could draw your conclusion.
MR. DVORETZKY:

So let me make two

points, Justice Sotomayor.
First, the complete response letter is

5

not a statute that can be read in the same way

6

as a textualist would read a statute.

7

to be understood against the backdrop of the

8

statutory and regulatory background.

9
10
11

It has

But if we're going to focus just on
the response letter -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the statutory

12

background basically says the only way that you

13

advise someone to change a label, as I

14

understand it, is if it's minor changes.

15

would be a major change.

16

standards, they would have been acting

17

improperly if they had approved your language

18

with telling you make some cosmetic changes,

19

because they didn't think this was cosmetic.

20

MR. DVORETZKY:

And so, by regulatory

I respectfully

21

disagree and I think the United States

22

disagrees that that's how the FDA --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

they're right.

25

read them.

This

Doesn't mean

I read the statute.

I don't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, but looking --

2

looking at the statute, under 355(o)(4)(A), the

3

Secretary has a statutory obligation if it

4

believes a warning is warranted to work with

5

the manufacturer.

6

proposed changes by the manufacturer, it's

7

obligated by the statute, it shall initiate

8

discussions to reach agreement.

9

And if it disagrees with the

So it can't just say no to a warning

10

if it disagrees with the phrasing of it.

11

in fact --

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And,

Well, where --

13

where is the -- in the back and forth, do you

14

have references to atypical stress -- atypical

15

fractures?

16

MR. DVORETZKY:

So the term "atypical

17

femoral fracture" is what we're calling today

18

the risk that Respondents are concerned with.

19

That term did not even really begin to be

20

settled upon until a task force report that

21

came out later.

22

But what is clear both in the back and

23

forth and on the face of the complete response

24

letter is that Merck proposed to warn in both

25

the warning and precautions section and the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

adverse reactions section about low-energy

2

fractures at the subtrochanteric region of the

3

femoral shaft.

That's at Joint Appendix 511.

4

So the letter begins by noting that

5

that is what Merck proposed to warn about in

6

both sections of the label.

7

what the FDA is thinking about.

So we know that's

8

We also know from the FDA's treatment

9

of the adverse reactions section of this -- of

10

the proposed warning, that when it wants to

11

revise a justified warning, it does so.

12

for the adverse reactions warning, the -- the

13

FDA proposed edits.

14

precautions section, it didn't.

15

So,

But, for the warnings and

We know the same thing from the FDA's

16

October 2010 interaction with Merck.

17

point, after the task force had completed this

18

study and when the FDA carried out its

19

obligations under 355(o)(4), by initiating a

20

process with Merck, Merck again proposed some

21

language that included stress fractures, and

22

the FDA redlined it.

23

At that

So that's what the FDA does when it

24

thinks a warning is justified but it disagrees

25

with the manufacturer's proposed language.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

doesn't --

2
3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel -- I'm

sorry.

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, please.
I think the question

6

that we're all kind of struggling with here

7

seems to me to be this, or something along

8

these lines:

9

we create a moral hazard that encourages

Reading the statute your way, do

10

manufacturers to supply the FDA with a lot of

11

information, overwhelming with data, but maybe

12

not the most artfully drafted and maybe

13

deliberately inartfully drafted warning that it

14

thinks is reasonably calculated to be refused,

15

so that it can avoid having to shoulder or bear

16

its own costs of -- of -- internalize its own

17

costs of negligence.

18

What -- what -- what comfort can you

19

give the Court that that's not the -- the

20

outcome of the statutory regime reading that

21

you're proposing?

22

MR. DVORETZKY:

So one comfort that I

23

would give the Court is that the FDA itself,

24

which is -- would be in the position of -- of

25

having the problem that you're describing,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

doesn't seem concerned about that problem.

2

But the other comfort that I would

3

give you is that we don't dispute that, under

4

the statute, both parties, both the FDA and the

5

manufacturer, have certain responsibilities.

6

We're not trying to absolve the manufacturer of

7

its responsibilities.

8

But, when you have before you an

9

impossibility preemption case where the FDA

10

rejected a proposed warning, the only way to

11

understand the meaning of that rejection and

12

what it means for impossibility is in light of

13

the FDA's part of its obligations.

14

The FDA does have some obligations.

15

And where it is provided with a warning that it

16

understood to be about the relevant risk and

17

rejects that, that necessarily establishes that

18

it was impossible for the manufacturer to

19

simultaneously comply with both what --

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but your -- the

21

way you answered that question, you said a

22

warning that it understood to be about the

23

relevant risk, and -- and that's really the

24

question.

25

The back and forth about the proposal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

and about the FDA's reaction to it is whether

2

the FDA understood to be -- the warning to be

3

about major fractures, given that your proposal

4

talked, I think, in six different sentences

5

about stress fractures.

6

MR. DVORETZKY:

So let me address the

7

stress fracture language because I think that

8

may be causing some of the -- some of the

9

confusion here.

10

The -- the risk that Merck warned

11

about was about these atypical -- I'm sorry,

12

about low-energy fractures at the

13

subtrochanteric region.

14

Merck explained to the FDA how it was using the

15

term "stress fractures".

16

At Joint Appendix 746,

And it explained to the FDA that the

17

term "stress fractures" included the very same

18

kinds of things that Respondents are concerned

19

about, including insufficiency fractures and

20

complete fractures.

21

low-energy fractures, which is how Merck was

22

using this term.

Those are all kinds of

23

And, moreover, the reason --

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Well, but, if I

understand the -- if I understand the sort of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

terminology, and maybe I don't, but

2

insufficiency stress fractures are, you know,

3

essentially, there's a world of things where

4

you can have a traumatic incident that leads to

5

a fracture and then you can have other

6

fractures that are not caused by trauma, right?

7

But the fractures that are not caused

8

by trauma can be small fractures, stress

9

fractures that take care of themselves with

10

rest and elevation, and large fractures, where

11

all of a sudden you're staring at a bone that's

12

popping out the wrong way.

13

So those are really different things.

14

They're both caused by something that's not

15

trauma, but one is an inconvenience and the

16

other is a serious injury.

17

MR. DVORETZKY:

The serious injury,

18

the complete fracture, is something that begins

19

as what looks like a stress fracture and can

20

progress to completion.

21

trying to do in this warning was to explain, if

22

somebody comes in complaining of the kind of

23

pain that might be consistent with a stress

24

fracture, doctors ought to figure out what's

25

causing that.

And so what Merck was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

And if you rule out the typical causes

2

of stress fractures -- exercise, steroids,

3

alcohol use, things like that -- if you rule

4

those out, and they don't explain the symptoms

5

that the doctor's seeing, then maybe consider

6

stopping bisphosphonate use, because perhaps

7

there's a connection between bisphosphonate use

8

and what will eventually progress to the

9

completed fracture.

10

That's --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

If -- if we read

11

your -- the letters to refer to stress

12

fractures as something -- and not atypical

13

fractures, could you still win this case?

14

MR. DVORETZKY:

We could because,

15

regardless of how you read the letters, the FDA

16

has told us in this Court and has all -- and

17

all of the FDA's actions in connection with

18

this -- with this area show that it understood

19

what we were talking about.

20

And the one additional piece of

21

evidence that I would point to that I haven't

22

identified to this point, in March 2010, months

23

after the FDA issued its complete response

24

letter, it made a public safety announcement

25

saying that it was continuing to study this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

issue of atypical femoral fractures.

2

was not convinced that the data supported a

3

warning, and that doctors should continue to

4

prescribe in accordance with the existing

5

label.

6

It still

That shows, again, that FDA -- the FDA

7

was on top of this problem.

8

it.

9

reached a belief that a warning was justified.

10

It was studying

And it had not yet even months later

Given that, it was impossible for

11

Merck to provide one in accordance with the

12

purported requirements of state law.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

What do we do about

14

the fact that under the regulations Merck could

15

have filed a CBE at any time?

16

problem for you, at least after, say, the --

17

the March investigation starts?

18

MR. DVORETZKY:

Does that pose a

It -- it -- that

19

doesn't pose a problem for us.

The standards

20

for evaluating a CBE are the same as the

21

standards for evaluating a PAS.

22

essentially the difference between asking

23

forgiveness and asking permission.

24

know that the FDA rejected the PAS, we also

25

know that a CBE would not have been authorized

It's

Because we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

either, and, again, that's what establishes

2

impossibility preemption.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Perhaps I'll spot

4

you that with respect to -- for purposes of

5

this question before the March 2010 letter, but

6

what about after that?

7

launching an investigation into the product,

8

the task force period, what do we do about that

9

period?

10

MR. DVORETZKY:

Once it starts

Well, I think the

11

point, though, is that in March 2010, what the

12

FDA said is that it was waiting on the task

13

force report.

14

just said that it was studying the information.

Nothing had yet changed.

It

15

When the task force report came out,

16

that's when the FDA acted and said now we are

17

-- now we believe that a warning is justified,

18

and it initiated its 355(o)(4) process.

19

that's what the FDA -- if the FDA had thought

20

that a warning were justified earlier, that's

21

what it would have done.

issued this complete response letter.

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER
MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
I'd like to begin by addressing an

9

issue that both Justice Kagan and Justice

10

Gorsuch have touched on, and I think it's

11

important to distinguish between two potential

12

types of confusion.

13

The first is that, in October of 2010,

14

when the FDA ultimately decided that an

15

addition to the warnings and precautions

16

section of these labels was warranted, it

17

rejected Merck's proposal that the warning

18

include repeated uses of the term "stress

19

fracture".

20

And FDA did express at that time the

21

concern that practitioners, for whom that term

22

usually connoted a relatively minor event,

23

might read it as understating the seriousness

24

of the potential health risk of Fosamax.

25

That potential type of confusion needs

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

to be distinguished from the question, was FDA

2

confused by Merck's submission as a whole?

3

there's no reason to think that that was so.

4

And

At page 670 of the Joint Appendix,

5

Merck kind of, in the introductory section of

6

its proposal, summarizes what it's -- the

7

warning that it's proposing to add, and it says

8

at the very top of the page:

9

proposing to add language to both the

Merck is

10

precaution and adverse reaction post-marketing

11

experience section of the label to describe

12

low-energy fractures that have been reported,

13

of which some have been stress insufficiency at

14

the subtrochanteric region of the femoral

15

shaft.

So --

16
17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
What page is that again?

18
19

I'm sorry.

MR. STEWART:

Page 670 of the Joint

Appendix.

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

MR. STEWART:

Thank you.

And so Merck was making

22

clear that the language it was proposing to add

23

both to the warnings and precaution section and

24

the adverse reactions section proposed to

25

address the same risk.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

And, indeed, the language that it

2

proposed to add to the adverse reactions

3

section included a cross-reference to the

4

proposed warnings and precaution section,

5

again, reinforcing this.

6

The second thing I'd like to point out

7

in that regard is what my colleague was

8

referring to as the -- Merck's own explanation

9

for its use of the term "stress fracture".

10

Merck explained at page 746 of the Joint

11

Appendix in its proposal that it was using the

12

term as an umbrella term to refer to fractures

13

that could be partial or complete.

14

distinguishing event was that they occur

15

without external trauma.

The

16

And so it's not a matter of something

17

being a serious fracture or a stress fracture.

18

The term "stress fracture" encompasses both

19

serious and relatively minor fractures.

20

FDA's concern ultimately was that practitioners

21

who were used to seeing the term in connection

22

with minor events might misconstrue it.

23

Again,

But FDA understood it to refer more

24

generally to any fracture that was caused

25

without external trauma.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But how are we to

2

understand, Mr. Stewart, like what FDA

3

understands at any given moment?

4

words, what are we to look to when we decide

5

whether it's impossible for Merck to change its

6

label?

In other

7

Because one easy way of thinking about

8

whether it's impossible for Merck to change its

9

label is to say:

Did the FDA tell Merck that

10

it couldn't change its label in the relevant

11

way?

12

impossible.

13

If the FDA told Merck that, then it's

But, if the FDA didn't tell Merck

14

that, whatever is in the FDA's head, if the FDA

15

didn't tell Merck that, then it's not

16

impossible for Merck to change its label, and

17

it has responsibility over its label, and to

18

the extent that it thinks that the literature

19

supports a change, it should change its label.

20

MR. STEWART:

Well, let me say two or

21

three things about that.

The first is you look

22

first and foremost to the letter itself, and it

23

would obviously have been better if the letter

24

had stated without ambiguity the reason we are

25

rejecting your proposed addition to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

warnings and precaution section is that we

2

don't think there is sufficient evidence of

3

causation to warrant inclusion of this health

4

risk in this particular portion of the label.

5

That would have been better.

6

that the letter that --

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

Given

That would

8

have been better, and it would have been

9

enough, right?

10

We wouldn't -- we wouldn't be

here?

11

MR. STEWART:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13
14

Exactly.
Or maybe we would, but

it would be an easy case, Merck would win?
MR. STEWART:

Right.

But, failing

15

that, failing an unambiguous letter, the Court

16

should construe the letter in light of Merck's

17

submission, in light of the surrounding

18

statutory and regulatory scheme, and in light

19

of FDA's subsequent --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. STEWART:

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why?

-- subsequent actions.
Why?

Merck is a

23

manufacturer of a drug.

It has a tort duty to

24

ensure that its drugs are either safe or that

25

adequate warnings are given when it's not.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

The Act does not take away that

2

responsibility.

It does say that you have to

3

get approval from the FDA.

4

ambiguity, given that we're already creating

5

something that doesn't exist, impossibility

6

preemption, why shouldn't we take it at its --

7

at its face?

8

MR. STEWART:

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But, if there's any

Well, for -Until the FDA says

10

no, if you're a manufacturer who understands

11

there's a serious risk to a drug, shouldn't you

12

continue to try everything possible, including

13

making the corrections that you were told to

14

make, including doing what the task force did,

15

telling the FDA you're wrong?

16

Instead, what Merck did was say, I'm

17

absolved, I don't have to make the changes, I

18

don't have to talk to them anymore, I just have

19

to let them -- "them" being the FDA -- figure

20

out what to do.

21
22
23

Seems to be sort of turning
responsibility on its head.
MR. STEWART:

Well, as you say, an

24

important feature of the statutory and

25

regulatory scheme is that, while the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

manufacturer has responsibility for its label,

2

it can make changes only with FDA's approval.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Not true.

It

4

could go the other route and make the change

5

itself and wait for the FDA to tell it it's

6

wrong.

7

MR. STEWART:

That's true.

But the --

8

the reason that FDA sometimes disapproves

9

proposed additions to warnings and precautions

10

or to other aspects of the label is not simply

11

that it regards the warnings as unnecessary.

12

FDA has expressed a concern about the potential

13

ill effects of over-warning; that is, if a

14

label contains information about every possible

15

health risk or every bad thing that has ever

16

happened to a person who used the drug, people

17

may be deterred from using a drug that would

18

actually be useful.

19
20
21

The really important warnings tend to
get drowned out.

So --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what happens

22

here to the incentive for manufacturers to

23

continue working expeditiously with the FDA to

24

effect changes when they're necessary?

25

MR. STEWART:

Well, our -- our point

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

is that if the better reading of the letter, if

2

the better understanding of FDA's intent is

3

that it rejected the proposed addition because

4

it felt that the medical evidence wasn't there,

5

then for -- any preemption regime that would

6

create an incentive for Merck nevertheless to

7

add the warning through the CBE process and

8

wait for FDA to disapprove it would, in our

9

view, be counterproductive.

It would create

10

the incentive for the type of over-warning that

11

FDA would like to discourage.

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But if I --

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

So what would happen

14

if -- if the FDA had said in response -- in the

15

complete response letter the medical evidence

16

is insufficient and then Merck turned around

17

within a short period of time and filed a -- a

18

CBE relating to the same thing?

19

FDA have done?

20

MR. STEWART:

What would the

I think it would surely

21

have disapproved it.

And it would have been

22

inappropriate for Merck to proceed in that way

23

because the CBE process is supposed to be

24

invoked only when there is new evidence that

25

the FDA hasn't previously considered.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

And if the FDA had said, in response

2

to the PAS application, we don't think the

3

medical evidence is there, then, unless some

4

substantial body of new medical evidence had

5

emerged during the interim, it would have been

6

inappropriate for Merck to use the CBE route

7

and it would be inevitable that FDA would

8

disapprove it.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I take it --

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could --

-- Mr. Stewart, you're

12

saying two things.

There are sort of two

13

points on a spectrum that you're pretty clear

14

about.

15

don't think -- we understand that this proposal

16

is about major risks and we don't think that

17

there's enough evidence in the literature to

18

support that, that's -- that's easy, Merck

19

doesn't change its label, and there can't be

20

suit against Merck.

One is, if FDA had told them, we just

21

On the other hand, suppose that the

22

FDA -- and I -- I -- I understood this to be

23

your point -- suppose that the FDA had said,

24

you know, what's the -- the real problem with

25

your label is that you're talking about stress

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

fractures, and we think that the issue is these

2

major fractures, and that's why we're rejecting

3

it, and we're going to continue to be

4

considering the possibility of major fractures.

5

If the FDA had said that clearly,

6

Merck is not off the hook.

7

with that?

8
9

MR. STEWART:

Would you agree

that with this caveat:

I -- I would agree with
That you would expect

10

the -- the letter -- given that the

11

documentation in Merck's submission included a

12

lot of information about the more serious type

13

of fracture, even if FDA was concerned about

14

the wording of the label, you would expect it

15

to express a view one way or the other as to

16

whether there was sufficient evidence of

17

causation.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It -- it doesn't know

19

yet, let's assume.

20

it just doesn't know yet.

21

rejecting the letter for another reason.

22

So this is something that
And -- and it's

Now you might expect that FDA would

23

continue to work with Merck about the major

24

fractures.

25

But the only thing that the FDA has told Merck

You might expect a lot of things.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

is we don't like this label that you've done

2

about stress fractures because we really think

3

stress fractures are not a problem.

4

MR. STEWART:

I guess, if FDA had said

5

that unambiguously, it wouldn't trigger

6

impossibility, but it seems very unlikely and

7

really inconsistent with the statutory and

8

regulatory scheme to suppose that FDA would do

9

that, that it would receive a submission about

10

the risks of these more serious fractures and

11

yet would make no determination, even if -- in

12

its own mind as to whether that risk was

13

sufficiently severe, whether the evidence of

14

causation was sufficient to warrant an

15

additional warning.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Wait, I guess you're

17

changing my -- my -- you know, I meant this to

18

be a hypothetical, where you could assume a

19

hypothetical on both sides, right, where the

20

language was sufficiently clear of what FDA was

21

doing, that it either would or wouldn't take

22

Merck off the hook.

23

My real question for you is suppose

24

we're not at either one of those worlds.

25

Suppose we have an ambiguous letter.

Who

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

should decide how to construe it?

2

MR. STEWART:

I think the Court

3

ultimately should construe it but should

4

construe it in light of the statutory and

5

regulatory scheme, which would have compelled

6

FDA to initiate the process for changing the

7

label if it had determined that the evidence of

8

causation was sufficient to support an addition

9

of some warning to the warnings and precaution

10

section.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK

MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Our position is that brand-name drug

19

makers are responsible at all times for keeping

20

their labels up to date.

21

inadequate warning, or is uncertain about

22

whether and how to mandate a proper warning,

23

those federal decisions do not make it

24

impossible for Merck to comply with state law

25

duties to market safe drugs.

If the FDA rejects an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

I'd like to start, if I could, with

2

Section 355(o)(4)(I), which is set forth in the

3

addendum to the red brief on page 8.

4

provision explains why it is not impossible for

5

Merck to provide an adequate warning of

6

atypical femoral fractures prior to 2010 when

7

the FDA mandated a label change.

8
9

That

It's the manufacturer's responsibility
to maintain its label.

So, Mr. Chief Justice,

10

in answer to your question about the back and

11

forth, all that demonstrates is that, at best,

12

FDA was uncertain about exactly what Merck was

13

proposing.

14

is barely discussed at all on the other side's

15

written presentations in this case, makes it

16

clear that even when FDA got the power in 2007

17

for the first time in 60 years to mandate a

18

proper warning, the manufacturer, nonetheless,

19

is always responsible for keeping its label up

20

to date.

21

But this statutory provision, which

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, is it your

22

argument now that -- that Merck is -- Merck

23

became liable at some point after the issuance

24

of the complete response letter or on the day

25

after the issuance of the complete response

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1
2

letter?
MR. FREDERICK:

Our position, Your

3

Honor, is that the complete response letter in

4

a sense doesn't affect the underlying duties at

5

all because the -- the warning that was

6

proposed was an inadequate warning.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

What if -- but what if

8

the -- the FDA had said the wording of your --

9

of your warning is bad because this term

10

"stress fracture" is misleading, but beyond

11

that, the data does not support any warning

12

relating to low-energy femoral fractures?

13

MR. FREDERICK:

I think it's important

14

to keep in mind what the regulatory duty of the

15

agency's --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, what would --

17

MR. FREDERICK:

The answer to that is

18

that it -- that likely points stronger in the

19

direction of preemption, but please look at

20

Section 314.110(a)(1) of the regulations

21

because that regulation tells the FDA in its

22

complete response letter you have to give a

23

full answer, a full justification because

24

that's part of the back and forth, the give and

25

take with the manufacturer.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

And so, Justice Gorsuch, to your

2

question about the moral hazard, it's not just

3

if the manufacturer deliberately misleads the

4

FDA by putting in.

5

company is negligent and doesn't fully

6

understand itself.

7

It's also if -- if the

I would ask you to look at the amicus

8

brief by Dr. Lane in this case.

Dr. Lane was a

9

consultant for Merck in 2008 prior to Merck

10

submitting its PAS.

11

surely by that time Merck would have had enough

12

information to have prepared an adequate

13

warning about these atypical femoral fractures.

14

What Dr. Lane says is that

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Mr. Frederick,

15

let -- let's say I buy at least part of what

16

you're selling, for purposes of this question,

17

that the complete response letter and, what is

18

it, 355(o)(4) --

19

MR. FREDERICK:

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21
22

(I).
-- doesn't -- thank

you -- doesn't completely answer our question.
We have, though, the March 2010 safety

23

statement from the FDA which pretty clearly

24

says that they do not think that there is

25

science enough to support a causal link between

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

the drug and atypical femoral fractures.

2

whatever was missing in the complete response

3

letter from the FDA seems to come in March of

4

2010.

5

So

Why shouldn't we read the complete

6

response letter in light of the March 2010

7

safety --

8
9

MR. FREDERICK:

Again, we're getting

into the agency musings of the type that

10

Justice Thomas very eloquently wrote about in

11

Wyeth versus Levine, which is it is not

12

impossible for the manufacturer to have done

13

the right thing.

14

What Dr. Lane says --

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, you and I will

15

not dispute the elegance of Justice Thomas's

16

opinion in Wyeth.

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19

But I'm not sure

that helps me very much.

20

(Laughter.)

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And -- and in all

22

seriousness, if -- if there's some ambiguity

23

about the warning letter, about the complete

24

response letter, isn't that resolved by the

25

FDA's own statement against interest, perhaps,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

months later, why doesn't that tell us exactly

2

what it was up to?

3

MR. FREDERICK:

Because the standard

4

is lower.

5

release in March of 2010, when the FDA uses the

6

phrase "causal connection", that's not what the

7

regulatory standard is.

8

regulatory standard on page 6 of our brief.

9

And that is a much lower one.

10

And if you look at that press

We set out the

When it's for the precaution letter,

11

it's to provide reasonable evidence of a causal

12

relationship or causal association.

13

evidence is something that Dr. Lane knew in

14

twenty -- 2008, and was urging Merck to provide

15

a better explanation.

16

Reasonable

And that's why on page 17 of

17

Dr. Lane's amicus brief here he says what FDA

18

needed was "a medically accurate education."

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, and that's why

20

it set up the task force at the same time to go

21

study the issue, and it said up to that point

22

we don't have enough, but we're going to go

23

study it.

24

MR. FREDERICK:

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And -And so why isn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

that -- tell us everything we need to know

2

about what its complete response letter was

3

about, as a matter of law?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Because, Justice --

5

Justice -- Justice Gorsuch, that's the whole

6

point of impossibility preemption.

7

going to let Dr. Monroe, who is five layers

8

down from the only Presidentially-appointed

9

person at the FDA, write a letter that

Now what -- what the SG is arguing

12

here is that we should interpret -- the better

13

reading of this, the -- the -- the back and

14

forth, the full record should inform the

15

meaning of this letter.

16
17
18

But impossibility preemption, as Wyeth
versus Levine held, is a "demanding defense."
JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, that's not

19

really -- I mean, are you really serious about

20

that argument?

21

the letter.

22

FDA would do.

What would be preemptive is not

The only argument relating to the

24

safety -- the safety announcement is that it

informs, it helps to tell us what FDA meant

38
1

when it said no, you cannot add a warning to

2

this label.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

Justice Alito, we know

the answer when Merck proposes an inadequate

5

warning.

6

That was rejected.
We don't know the answer to the

7

question that Wyeth versus Levine poses, which

8

is what would have happened had Merck proposed

9

an adequate warning.

Okay.

The other question, technical, is, is a

-- what is it called -- the atypical femur

3

fracture, is that a subset of stress fractures?

4

MR. FREDERICK:

What Dr. Lane explains

5

is that an atypical femoral fracture may have

an origination as a stress fracture, but it

7

sort of goes off in a completely different

8

direction.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's all right.

10

But okay.

11

they use that word, they might mean atypical

That's very, very

No -I'm leading to this,

that, when you talk about the standard, drugs

10

are important to people.

11

or thousands anyway, of people who need to be

12

cured or helped.

13

They cure millions,

Now, when you put on, and at the same

14

time there will be a smaller subset that can be

15

hurt, so our solution to that is labels.

16

Now, when you say displacing state law

17

or something, you're talking like a lawyer,

18

which is what you're supposed to do, but what

19

worries me is, if you go too far in allowing

20

the tort jury to find mislabeling by not

21

including things, you are hurting the vast

22

majority of -- of women here or -- or whatever

23

who can benefit from this medicine.

24
25

On the other hand, if you don't go far
enough, you will hurt that minority.

Now

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

that's the general framework in which I'm

2

trying to figure out the answer to the

3

question.

4

question was -- was quite relevant.

5

And that's why Justice Gorsuch's

All the earmarks here are that Merck

6

took this as a letter saying we're not certain

7

enough this is really going to hurt people and

8

we don't want you to put it on.

9

Now, obviously, somebody must have

10

picked up the phone when they got that letter

11

and they must have phoned somebody in FDA and

12

say:

13

mean?

14

"stress fracture," in two seconds.

15

mean you don't know enough about it?

Do you really mean that?

What do you

Because I can change those words,
Or do you

16

Now the appointment of the later task

17

force suggests that they felt they didn't know

18

enough about it, and, therefore, Merck couldn't

19

have done it.

20

Now that's -- that's -- I'm looking

21

for your answer.

22

and --

I put out a pretty abstract

23

MR. FREDERICK:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Yes.
-- somewhat specific

but more abstract question.

I would like you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

to react.
MR. FREDERICK:

Let's -- let's not

3

look at what the lawyers knew.

what the scientists knew.

5

scientists -- and this is on page 515 of the

6

Joint Appendix -- they knew exactly what the

7

FDA was rejecting.

Let's look at

earlier had said:

Those scientists had

These are a special type of

Ninety plus percent of all people who

get an atypical femoral fracture are on a

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I understood

19

these -- Mr. Stewart to say it is a particular

20

type of fracture, it's a particular type of

21

stress fracture, and that the FDA understood

22

the use of that term to be broad enough to

23

include the atypical fractures as well.

24

MR. FREDERICK:

That's not accurate.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

That's not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

what he said?

2

MR. FREDERICK:

I don't know if that's

3

what he said, but we would dispute whether

4

that's correct.

5

you look at Dr. Burr's expert report, which is

6

in the Joint Appendix, and if you look at

7

Dr. Lane's amicus brief, they say this is a

8

very specialized form of fracture that

9

generally doesn't occur in the general

population.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But you -- you

12

-- you agree that the question is what the FDA

13

understood, right?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

I think that that

15

question comes second, respectfully, Mr. Chief

16

Justice.

17

The first question is, what did the

18

manufacturer know or should have known at a

19

particular point in time?

20

question is, what did the FDA understand about

21

that?

22

started my argument with, it's always on the

23

manufacturer to stay up to date.

25

And then the next

And so you're talking about a

Well, but what

7

we're talking about is what -- what they told

8

the FDA, what the FDA understood.

9

they told the FDA about -- and we have the

And if when

10

different citations to the Joint Appendix from

11

your -- your friend on the other side -- about

12

the -- the notion that stress fracture included

13

the things -- the atypical fractures, and if

14

that's what Merck understood, they gave to the

15

FDA what they had.

16

understood, that's how we should interpret the

17

FDA's response.

18

And if that's what the FDA

MR. FREDERICK:

And, Mr. Chief

19

Justice, as a matter of preemption law where

20

we're invoking the Supremacy Clause of the

21

United States Constitution to say that federal

22

law is going to displace state law, we

23

shouldn't be engaging in some musings or some

24

interpretation about a low-level civil servant

25

at the FDA and what that --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

They're not low-level

civil servants.

3

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I -- I don't

4

understand your response.

I understand the

5

Supremacy Clause and state law, but the

6

question is, what was being communicated to the

7

FDA?

8

So how is it -- how should they have

9

read and how did the FDA understand their own

10

response?

11

because we're hearing about it from the

12

government's counsel today.

13

And we know the answer to that

MR. FREDERICK:

So I'll read to you

from page 515 of the Joint Appendix.

22

They say:

This is

"However,

It believes that 'stress

So the scientists are interpreting the

23

complete response letter to say the "stress

24

fracture" language that we offered is

25

inadequate.

The FDA has rejected that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

language.

2

And the reason why the wording matters

3

is because, as we've pointed out in our brief

4

-- and I think it's at page 41, Footnote 20 --

5

page 40, Footnote 21 -- there's a lot of back

6

and forth between drug companies and the FDA

7

over the wording.

8

understands that the wording has to properly

9

educate doctors about the risks associated with

10

Why?

Because the FDA

these drugs.

11

And if the doctors can't understand

12

the gravity of a warning where one of their

13

patients may be walking down the street and

14

have her femur snap, that's what we're trying

15

to get at the proper wording of these labels.

16

And that's why Congress --

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

The thing -- what Mr.

MR. FREDERICK:

-- made the decision

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm sorry.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

That's why Congress

19

--

20
21

Could you --

to -Go ahead.

24

made the decision to keep the manufacturer at

25

all times.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47

JUSTICE ALITO:

What Mr. Stewart cited

2

was page 746 of the Joint Appendix, where Merck

3

defines a stress fracture in this way:

4

stress fracture (also known as an insufficiency

5

fracture) is defined as a partial or complete

6

fracture occurring with either normal or

7

increased activity but without an identifiable

8

external traumatic event."

9
10

"A

Now does not that encompass a -- the
type of fracture that you're talking about?

11

MR. FREDERICK:

Not really.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it says "or

13

complete."

14

MR. FREDERICK:

It does, Justice

15

Alito.

But the question is, if you are an FDA

16

scientist who has been looking at the studies,

17

are you going to let Merck redefine what a

18

stress fracture is?

19

brief says, no, no, no, that's not what a

20

stress fracture is.

21

medically inaccurate, definition.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Dr. Lane in his amicus

That is an inaccurate, a
It's --

Yeah, well, that's

23

fine, but this is what -- you know, in very

24

simple terms, this is what troubles me about

25

your argument.

This is not a situation, I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

think, where Merck is proposing to warn about

2

one thing and the data shows that there's a

3

danger about something that's totally

4

unrelated, and, therefore, the FDA may not

5

focus on this second thing, like Justice

6

Kagan's example of -- perhaps of ovarian cancer

7

and ovarian cysts -- cysts.

8
9

But, if the FDA sees this proposed
warning and they think this -- the -- the

10

wording here is bad, they shouldn't be talking

11

about stress fractures, but we look at the data

12

and we see that there is something that should

13

be labeled differently and it should be --

14

there should be a warning about that, it would

15

-- it would shock me if the -- what the FDA

16

should do in that situation is to say:

17

you know, you got the warning wrong and so

18

we're not going to issue it and we're going to

19

do -- we're going to prohibit that, but we're

20

not going to do anything more.

21

Well,

If they understood that there was a

22

danger of something else that is at least

23

related to what the manufacturer was proposing

24

to warn about, surely the public would expect

25

them to do something.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

MR. FREDERICK:

And, Justice --

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

That's what troubles

4

MR. FREDERICK:

Yeah, and --

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- about your

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, Justice Alito,

3

6
7

me --

argument.

8

if you look further into the record of what

9

happened here, there's an April 2009 email

10

chain between the FDA and Merck in which FDA

11

says it wants to "work with Merck on

12

precautions language" if it is warranted.

13

It's still trying to understand,

14

because these are a specialized, highly unique

15

set of injuries here.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.

So suppose,

17

Mr. Frederick, that the best reading of what

18

happened here is that the FDA looks at this

19

letter and it says -- this proposal, and it

20

says this is a terrible proposal; whatever the

21

problem is, the problem is not stress fractures

22

and -- and so we're going to reject that.

23

we do think that there is an issue -- and we

24

don't know the answer to it yet -- we do think

25

that there's an issue about this -- these more

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1
2

major fractures.
And -- and you see this because,

3

eventually, they do a task force and they --

4

and then the task force decides something.

5

So, if the FDA is in that boat, right,

6

where it -- it -- it -- it -- it -- it sends

7

the letter and the letter says what you've said

8

is just inadequate and wrong, but we don't know

9

yet what we're really dealing with and we don't

10

know whether a change in your label is

11

appropriate, and we're going to continue to

12

study that, what should the manufacturer do at

13

that time?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

The manufacturer

15

should continue to study the problem, should

16

continue to provide information to the FDA.

17
18
19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Should the

manufacturer change the label?
MR. FREDERICK:

Possibly.

It depends,

20

Justice Kagan, on what the manufacturer knows

21

and its understanding of the science.

22

Here -- let's take -- Justice Alito,

23

if we could follow your hypothetical a little

24

bit further.

Suppose FDA had approved this

25

label, okay?

All this language about stress

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

fractures, that's now in the label.

2

can't be preempted then, right?

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

True.

Our claim

But what's

4

actually bothering me about the approach that

5

you're taking is that, in this particular area,

6

in this particular area of medicines, I don't

7

really see how we're going to benefit by 50

8

different states really giving different

9

signals to the manufacturers, and I can see a

10

lot of ways in which, from a health point of

11

view, we're going to lose.

12

That doesn't mean the law is wrong.

13

It doesn't mean -- you know, it's just a

14

question of emphasis.

15

emphasis.

And, here, we have an

16

The next page from the one you cited,

17

the FDA says in 2010, FDA's review of the data

18

did not show an increase in this risk, the

19

relevant risk, in women using these

20

medications.

21
22

So there are indications in this
record --

23

MR. FREDERICK:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

Right.
-- that they thought

that it is more dangerous to put the label --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

to put the risk in the label than it is to

2

leave it out.

3

MR. FREDERICK:

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

And -And then they set up

a task force and decide they were wrong.

6

MR. FREDERICK:

And here's -- here --

7

this is a really interesting thing about the

8

task force:

9

all of the relevant information, because what

10

the task force finds is that there are about

11

170 some articles that had been written on this

12

subject.

13

or that -- that was evidence that the FDA was

14

aware of.

15

The FDA clearly didn't have all --

Only five had been given to the FDA,

And so that's why the statute imposes

16

the duty on the manufacturer, because the

17

manufacturer's going to be tracking this all

18

over the world.

19

report from a -- a Merck employee in Singapore

20

in 2006 who said I've now seen several of these

21

specialized atypical femoral fractures, I think

22

this could be an indication that we need a

23

safety signal.

24
25

There was a -- there was a

And -- and, Justice Breyer, I accept
your -- your basic point, but what started this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

whole thing was the first lawsuit against Merck

2

for these atypical femoral fractures was in

3

March of 2008, and that's what started this

4

whole back and forth.

5

this lawsuit and started to track what's really

6

going on here.

7

The FDA became aware of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What if you

8

had a situation where, in light of the

9

exchanges you've talked about, Merck goes ahead

10

and puts on its label, oh, and, by the way, you

11

should be very careful about these atypical

12

femoral fractures, not -- not -- and it turns

13

out that doctors say, well, gosh, if that's

14

going to happen, I'm not going to prescribe

15

Fosamax.

16

important for many women is no longer being

17

prescribed.

18

And, as a result, that drug which is

Now can somebody who thinks they

19

should not have put that warning in be able to

20

sue because they gave too many warnings and

21

that prevented doctors from prescribing a drug

22

that they otherwise should have been

23

prescribing?

24
25

MR. FREDERICK:

So, Mr. Chief Justice,

the answer is that the manufacturer's always

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

responsible for its label, but the over-warning

2

problem is one where the FDA is balancing these

3

risks and benefits at all times.

4
5
6
7

And, here, we know that wasn't a
problem.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, no, I

know you're changing the hypothetical.

8

MR. FREDERICK:

No, but --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Your point, I

10

-- well, maybe I don't know.

11

answer is that the manufacturer has the

12

responsibility.

13

this, it should put in this warning and, if it

14

turns out that that was over-warning, then they

15

can be sued for that?

16
17
18

I gather your

So, if the manufacturer knows

MR. FREDERICK:

Well, there has to be

an injury that comes from the over-warning.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The injury is

19

that doctors are not prescribing Fosamax to

20

women who would benefit from it and they're not

21

prescribing it because Merck put in a warning

22

that the FDA would determine was over-warning.

23

MR. FREDERICK:

Not -- Mr. Chief

24

Justice, respectfully, there's not a state law

25

tort there.

There has to be an injury because

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

of the over-warning, or else there's no suit.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The injury is

3

the physician decides not to prescribe Fosamax

4

to a woman who would benefit from it.

5
6

MR. FREDERICK:

9

But that's not

a tort.

7
8

Right.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So -- so it's

a tort -MR. FREDERICK:

There's no -- there's

10

no state law there that says there's negligence

11

in that circumstance, Your Honor.

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I

13

thought that -- I thought the logic would be

14

the same as your logic here, is that the label

15

turned out to be misleading because of the drug

16

manufacturer's decision about what to include,

17

which they should have included even though

18

it's not required by the FDA.

19

would be the same cause of action.

20

MR. FREDERICK:

I thought that

But my point here, Mr.

21

Chief Justice, and let's go with a hypothetical

22

that the FDA had actually accepted this.

23

claim would be exactly the same, which is that

24

this language about stress fractures doesn't

25

tell the doctor worry about the prodromal pain,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Our

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

worry about how long your client has been on

2

bisphosphonate, worry about what the particular

3

features of the X-ray look like when the --

4

when the patient complains about this.

5

That wording was all in the 2010 label

6

that FDA mandated.

7

in 2009.

8
9

It wasn't in Merck's label

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Frederick,

let's be -- coming down to practical, okay?

10

You say earlier that the Merck scientists were

11

saying, when they received this letter, the FDA

12

doesn't like our language.

13

What do you suggest Merck could have

14

done without changing its label until the FDA

15

would have approved it?

16

that you can convince a jury that, if they had

17

done it your way, the FDA would have accepted

18

the new label?

19

MR. FREDERICK:

And why do you believe

Well, as a regulatory

20

matter, let's start with the law first.

21

CBE regulation gives the manufacturer the right

22

to change its label, subject to rescission by

23

the FDA.

24
25

The

That never happened here because Merck
never proposed an adequate warning.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, we know that

2

the FDA -- assuming the theory that the FDA

3

doesn't believe the label is adequate, what

4

could they have done --

5

MR. FREDERICK:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

They could --- absent the

study?

8

MR. FREDERICK:

They --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Meaning because

10

the study obviously changed the FDA's mind.

11

You're saying, you, Merck, could have done it.

12

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

There was plenty

13

of information by that point, Justice

14

Sotomayor, and Dr. Lane goes through this, he

15

goes through the chronology.

16

beautifully done amicus brief to explain what

17

the scientists knew and when they knew it and

18

by --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It's a

And that wasn't

20

communicated by Merck to the FDA?

21

you're saying?

22

MR. FREDERICK:

Yes.

Is that what

What -- what Dr.

23

Lane says -- and Dr. Lane is a Merck

24

consultant, okay, in the summer of 2008.

25

writing an amicus brief on our side of the case

Heritage Reporting Corporation

He's

Official - Subject to Final Review
58

because he doesn't believe that Merck gave

2

"medically accurate education" to the FDA about

3

these fractures.

4

He's the one who had coined the term

5

"Fosamax fracture" because, in all of his years

6

of osteology, he had not encountered these

7

kinds of fractures until he had patients coming

8

to him who were on this drug.

9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Frederick, you

10

want us to affirm the decision of the Third

11

Circuit?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

You should affirm the

13

judgment because the judgment was correct,

14

summary judgment for Merck was not warranted.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

Uh-huh.

And so then

16

the issue should be decided -- the juries in

17

these cases should decide whether the FDA would

18

have approved this --

19
20
21

MR. FREDERICK:

We take the position

JUSTICE ALITO:

-- based on that Merck

--

22

would have to prove to a jury by clear and

23

convincing evidence that the FDA would not have

24

approved an appropriate warning?

25

MR. FREDERICK:

We agree with Merck

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

that, because of the complete response letter

2

back and forth, we -- we think that that -- and

3

we argued this, I argued this in the Third

4

Circuit, was a legal document that a judge can

5

interpret.

6

interpretation of the letter, it doesn't prove

7

impossibility.

8

We believe that, based on a sound

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- so are you

9

saying that you think that the question is, was

10

there official action by the FDA that prevented

11

Merck from changing its label?

12

MR. FREDERICK:

And the answer to --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is that the test in

14

your view?

15

that prevented Merck from changing its label?

16

Is there official action by the FDA

MR. FREDERICK:

To make an adequate

17

warning, that's important, Justice Kagan,

18

because the warning that the FDA has to reject

19

has to be adequate to address the risks under

20

state law.

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Correct.

22

that's what I was assuming.

23

question.

24

correct?

25

Okay.

So

But that's the

And that's a legal question, is that

MR. FREDERICK:

It is a legal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1
2
3
4

question, but it has factual components.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But a judge can decide

that question.
MR. FREDERICK:

A judge can decide the

5

core legal question, but in all constitutional

6

questions, there are usually fact issues, and

7

we consign those to juries to decide what the

8

fact issues --

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Not always.

There

10

are a lot of mixed issues where, because

11

they're predominantly legal, the judge does it;

12

patents, for example, Markman is a case of

13

that, and does coerced confessions.

14

there are a number.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean,

As I said -It seems to me that

17

this is in that number because it's

18

predominantly a legal question and there could

19

be factual disputes on the brute facts.

20

here, I don't think there are really.

21

MR. FREDERICK:

But,

I think that the one

22

disputed fact here that has sort of surfaced as

23

a result of the argument today is, what does

24

the phrase "low energy" mean?

25

Merck and SG have taken the position

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

that "low energy" encompasses atypical femoral

2

fractures.

3

accurate.

4

Dr. Lane says actually that's not

And so, to the extent that there's a

5

debate between experts over the meaning of

6

particular scientific terms, judges, just --

7

Justice Breyer can certainly decide that, but

8

so can juries.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I believe they do,

10

but, normally, there's a factor, there are a

11

set of factors classically when it's a mixed

12

question of fact and law, and one of the

13

factors is sometimes who will do it better, at

14

least as I interpret it.

15

MR. FREDERICK:

And, as I say, we --

16

we briefed the case.

17

cases about constitutional issues, we don't see

18

that there's something special about the

19

preemption provision or the Supremacy Clause

20

that would take it out of the normal

21

fact-finding ambit of juries.

22

In light of this Court's

But I would say that, if you don't

23

agree with me on that, you still have to affirm

24

and instruct the court below, in fact, this is

25

going to be a legal question that judges are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

going to decide.

2

That does not affect the outcome of

3

the case here.

4

improper.

5

Summary judgment for Merck was

JUSTICE ALITO:

I'm confused.

So you

6

want us to say there is no preemption?

7

want us to say that Merck wasn't entitled to

8

summary judgment on the issue of preemption?

9

Which of the two?

10
11

MR. FREDERICK:

You

Merck was not entitled

to summary judgment.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, but you want to

13

alter the judgment of the Third Circuit by

14

saying that it was -- it was wrong in -- in

15

saying this should be submitted to a jury, that

16

it's a factual question to be submitted to a

17

jury?

18

MR. FREDERICK:

As I say, I think

19

there are fact questions here.

But, Justice

20

Alito, my brief argues that summary judgment

21

for Merck was improper.

22

extremely bizarre way this case came up on a

23

motion -- on an order to show cause, there

24

weren't even cross-motions for summary

25

judgment, which occurs in 99.999 percent of all

Because of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

cases.

2

So we're talking about how do you

3

handle a wrong district court judgment with the

4

Third Circuit doing the best it could in very

5

strange circumstances, and now the case is in

6

this Court.

7

You can affirm and you can say what

8

you want to say about jury issues deciding,

9

but, here, our position is the complete

10

response letter as a matter of law could not

11

have made it impossible for Merck to update its

12

labels.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

Oh, I'm sorry.

Thank you, counsel.

Mr. Dvoretzky, you have three minutes

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

19

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

20
21

So you want us --

MR. DVORETZKY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

22

If the FDA does not know yet whether a

23

warning is justified or not, that means no, the

24

manufacturer in that situation can't change the

25

label.

That's true whether we're talking about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

the CBE process or the PAS process.

2

And that's the situation here.

Mr.

3

Frederick focuses on low energy and stress

4

fracture, and any debate about that terminology

5

--

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about the

7

manufacturer's duty to work with the FDA to

8

ensure that the label is right and that it has

9

all pertinent information to reconsider its

10

initial decision?

11

Mr. Frederick said there were only

12

five of 170 articles provided to the FDA.

13

own scientists said they're confused.

14

Merck have an obligation to show that, if

15

presented with the proper language and the

16

proper evidence, that the FDA would have -- or

17

don't you have to show would have still denied

18

the right label?

19

MR. DVORETZKY:

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21
22

Your

Doesn't

Justice -Isn't that your

burden?
MR. DVORETZKY:

Justice Sotomayor, the

23

process that you're describing is exactly what

24

happened here.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

It didn't.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

You

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

never gave them a proper language and you never

2

gave them what your scientists told you to give

3

them.

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

Justice Sotomayor, the

5

PAS submission included 132 studies about the

6

risk that Respondents say we should have warned

7

about, the very same studies that Respondents

8

themselves rely on that.

9

before the FDA.

10

All of that was

The FDA isn't saying that it

was in any way misled.

11

And the back-and-forth process here,

12

if you look at Joint Appendix 508, the email

13

that Mr. Frederick referred to, an FDA official

14

told Merck to withdraw its request so that the

15

FDA could close out this issue while it

16

continued to study it and work with the FDA on

17

-- work with Merck on language later if it

18

determined that a warning was warranted.

19

In other words, at the time of the

20

CRL, based on all of the information that the

21

FDA had before it, and it doesn't claim that it

22

was misled, no warning was justified at that

23

time.

24
25

In March of 2010, the public safety
announcement, Joint Appendix 520, the FDA said

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

"the data did not show an increase in this risk

2

in women using this medication."

3

In light of that statement from the

4

FDA, there is no way that Merck could have

5

changed its warning because the FDA has told us

6

that no warning was justified at that time.

7

As for Dr. Lane, the -- Merck's

8

warning contains the two hallmarks that

9

Dr. Lane says were necessary.

The warning

10

itself on its face refers to insufficiency

11

fractures and complete fractures.

12

just refer to stress fractures.

13

It doesn't

With respect to the stress fracture

14

language, Dr. Lane himself in his amicus brief

15

admitted that AFFs start as stress fractures.

16

That's at page 9, Footnote 11, and also at page

17

12.

18

Mr. Chief Justice, if I may just wrap

19

up, where we know from the FDA's actions and

20

statements that no change was permissible,

21

because it's not scientifically justified, that

22

establishes preemption as a matter of law.

23
24

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
counsel.

Thank you,

The case is submitted.
