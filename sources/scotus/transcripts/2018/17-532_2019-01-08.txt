CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

argument first this morning in Case 17-532,

5

Herrera versus Wyoming.

6

Mr. Hicks.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. HICKS, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. HICKS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
In 1868, the Crow Tribe of Indians

12

agreed to cede to the United States 30 million

13

acres of its aboriginal land and move to a

14

reservation.

15

the tribe expressly reserved the right to hunt

16

on that ceded land.

17

In exchange for ceding its land,

The text of the 1868 treaty

18

memorializing this agreement explicitly

19

identifies the four events that would cause the

20

hunting right to terminate.

21

admission to the Union is not among them.

22

Wyoming's

Therefore, the only way that Wyoming's

23

statehood could have terminated the hunting

24

right is by implication, but that is the very

25

theory that this Court repeatedly rejected in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

Minnesota v. Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa

2

Indians.

3

And while the treaty does provide that

4

the right would terminate if the lands were no

5

longer unoccupied, President Cleveland's 1897

6

proclamation creating the Bighorn National

7

Forest did not suddenly render all 1.1 million

8

acres of the land comprising the forest

9

occupied as the parties to the treaty

10

understood that term.

11

As a result, the treaty right has not

12

terminated, and Petitioner should have been

13

permitted to invoke that right during his

14

criminal prosecution for hunting in the Bighorn

15

National Forest.

16

Before this Court, Wyoming largely

17

disregards Mille Lacs and urges this Court to

18

rely on its 1896 decision in Ward v. Race

19

Horse.

20

that led to the outcome in Race Horse.

21

Race Horse's reliance on the equal footing

22

doctrine to its characterization of treaty

23

rights as temporary and precarious --

But Mille Lacs repudiated the reasoning

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

MR. HICKS:

From

But --

-- to its belief that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

states -JUSTICE ALITO:

Even if you were right

3

about Race Horse, why isn't your client bound

4

by the judgment of the Tenth Circuit in Repsis

5

and, in particular, its disposition of the

6

question whether the land is occupied?

7

MR. HICKS:

8

responses for that.

9

Justice Alito, a few

First of all, the -- the issue of

10

whether the Tenth Circuit's alternative

11

determination has preclusive effect was not

12

pressed or passed on below.

13

the decisions of the state courts that address

14

the preclusive effect of that alternative

15

determination.

16

not address questions from state courts that

17

have not been pressed or passed on.

18

There's nothing in

And this Court typically does

JUSTICE ALITO:

So that -- that would

19

be available to the state to argue on remand if

20

you were to prevail on the other issues?

21

MR. HICKS:

Well, I think that the --

22

the state has likely forfeited that as a matter

23

of state law, but I also think that there are

24

other reasons why an exception to preclusion

25

would not apply.

I mean --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1
2

JUSTICE ALITO:

What's your best

reason?

3

MR. HICKS:

Primarily, it's that the

4

tribe did not have a full and fair opportunity

5

to litigate this issue in Repsis because it was

6

not raised in the Repsis district court.

7

was raised for the first time in the court of

8

appeals, and the court of appeals'

9

determination in the first instance was not

It

10

only one of several alternative determinations;

11

it wasn't subject to plenary appellate review.

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, those are

13

several reasons.

14

opportunity to raise the issue in the Tenth

15

Circuit?

16

The -- there was not a fair

MR. HICKS:

Well, I think that there

17

was not the full and fair opportunity to

18

litigate that question that this Court requires

19

before it gives preclusive effect.

20

JUSTICE ALITO:

Why -- why not?

Why

21

not in the Tenth Circuit?

22

a fair and -- a full and fair opportunity in

23

the Tenth Circuit?

24
25

MR. HICKS:

Why didn't they have

Well, to begin with, I

don't know if the full --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

They didn't allow

2

briefs?

3

didn't want to listen to anything that -- that

4

the tribe had to say?

5

They didn't allow arguments?

MR. HICKS:

They

Well, primarily because

6

this particular argument, that the creation of

7

the national forest in and of itself rendered

8

the entire land occupied so that the treaty

9

right was terminated, was, I believe, one page

10

of Wyoming's response brief in -- on an issue

11

that was never raised in the district court.

12

And so the only thing that the tribe

13

had to respond to that was limited space in a

14

reply brief where it had to respond to all of

15

the other arguments that Wyoming had made,

16

principally on the issue that the district

17

court had actually addressed.

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Could you --

Mr. Hicks, are -- are

20

you asking us to decide that issue, or are you

21

asking us to remand on that issue?

22

MR. HICKS:

I think there are several

23

reasons why you can decide that there was no

24

preclusive effect to the Tenth Circuit's

25

determination, among them, that it was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

forfeited; among them, that it was not a full

2

and fair opportunity so that it qualifies for

3

that exception, but also that that particular

4

determination in the first instance was not

5

subject to the plenary appellate review this

6

Court requires.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

If -- if -- if your

8

primary argument is that it was forfeited, and

9

I think you -- you have some good grounds for

10

thinking that, but given that that is a state

11

law matter, why wouldn't we remand to the

12

Wyoming courts to decide that forfeiture

13

question?

14

MR. HICKS:

Well, because I think

15

typically what this Court does when a -- an

16

issue has not been raised or pressed on below

17

is it -- is it doesn't allow the consideration

18

of it here.

19

reason to remand for consideration of that in

20

the first instance.

21

So I don't think there's any

But I think you can go on to address

22

that, you know, as a matter of an exception to

23

preclusion law.

24

several reasons why that wouldn't be given

25

preclusive effect.

I mean, I think that there are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm a little

2

confused.

3

-- you -- you're arguing you didn't get a fair

4

and full opportunity to litigate this in

5

Repsis?

6

opportunity?

7

What was forfeited when?

You didn't

In Repsis, there wasn't a fair

MR. HICKS:

That -- it is that the

8

tribe did not have the required full and fair

9

opportunity, among the reasons, in the Tenth

10

Circuit.

11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Was

12

that because when the Tenth -- I thought the

13

Tenth Circuit there asked for further briefing,

14

correct?

15
16

MR. HICKS:

No, they did not, Your

Honor.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

MR. HICKS:

19

There was no further

briefing in --

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. HICKS:

22

In the --

You're thinking of the

decision below --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

MR. HICKS:

25

Oh.

Right.

-- and the Wyoming state

courts asked for supplemental briefing on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

whether there was issue preclusion.

2

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

3

MR. HICKS:

Oh, okay.

And in response, the State

4

of Wyoming in this case did not ever raise this

5

as a ground for why there should be preclusive

6

effect given to anything in the Repsis

7

litigation.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I'll tell you

what troubles me about your position here and

10

your argument that we should decide these issue

11

preclusion questions.

12

you know, a couple of classes in law school on

13

issue preclusion, and you and the -- and the --

14

the government have raised significant issue

15

preclusion arguments that we're going to have

16

to decide in this case involving a misdemeanor

17

criminal conviction.

18

MR. HICKS:

This is like a little --

Well, Justice Alito, I

19

think those are actually good reasons to find

20

that there are -- you can apply the

21

well-established exceptions.

22

and fair opportunity --

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, the full

Well, I don't know

24

that they are well -- I don't know that they

25

are well established.

The exception that when

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

a judgment is raised it is based on two

2

alternative grounds, it's not -- there's no

3

issue preclusion on either ground, that's well

4

established?

5

circuits?

6

Hasn't that been rejected by six

MR. HICKS:

No, Your -- Your Honor,

7

that is incorrect.

8

the footnote in our reply brief, seven circuits

9

have actually accepted the Restatement's rule.

10
11
12
13

Actually, if you look at

I know that the State's brief says -JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, we haven't

accepted it, have we?
MR. HICKS:

No, this Court has not

14

addressed it, but it actually goes part and

15

parcel with what this Court has said about the

16

-- the critical importance of giving plenary --

17

plenary appellate review to determinations.

18

That is the premise --

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, it seems to me

20

like a significant question, and I was

21

underwhelmed by the reasons given in the

22

comment to the provision of the Restatement on

23

this question.

24
25

MR. HICKS:

Well, I think that --

first of all, I don't --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

The first reason they

2

give is that when -- when a court says our

3

judgment, right, is based on two alternative

4

grounds, and either one is independently

5

sufficient, that shouldn't have -- that

6

shouldn't have res judicata -- that shouldn't

7

have issue preclusion effect because, really,

8

the -- the court may not have seriously -- the

9

court may not have been accurate in saying each

10
11
12
13

one is independently sufficient.
Do you find that to -- do you find
that to be a particularly strong argument?
MR. HICKS:

Well, I think that it's a

14

-- it's an exception that applies in narrow

15

circumstances.

16

determination decided in the first instance.

17

And I think that, frankly, the Tenth Circuit's

18

decision here proves the policy underlying it.

You have to have an alternative

19

I mean, I don't -- there's not a great

20

defense of the Tenth Circuit's determination on

21

the merits.

22

the fact that there was such limited briefing.

23

It was only raised in the Tenth Circuit in one

24

page of briefing.

25

And I think that's demonstrated by

The tribe, you know, only had a very

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

limited amount of its reply brief.

2

when you combine, you know, the policies

3

underlying the full and fair opportunity, in

4

addition to the fact that it's an alternative

5

determination in the first instance, I think

6

the Tenth Circuit's determination is, you know,

7

demonstrating why the Restatement exception

8

exists.

9
10

So I think

And, again, it's a very -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel -- counsel,

11

I'll spot you that.

I mean, it's a little

12

curious that -- now I don't wish to fault my

13

old court, but the Tenth Circuit decided that

14

the land was occupied by the federal government

15

as an alternative holding without hearing from

16

the federal government, who now disclaims the

17

idea that they occupied the territory.

18

So I -- I -- I take your point.

But

19

do we have to get into any of this issue

20

preclusion stuff at all?

21

raised by the district, passed on by the

22

district court, relied on by the district

23

court, in this proceeding, why should we enmesh

24

ourselves in the excellent Wyoming law of issue

25

preclusion?

If this issue wasn't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

MR. HICKS:

Well, Justice Gorsuch, I

2

-- I don't think you need to get into that.

3

think you can advance to the merits and decide

4

the merits questions before you.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

6

Tell us about that.

7

MR. HICKS:

I

Let's do that then.

I -- I -- I would be happy

8

to do that, because, you know, if you go back

9

to this Court's decision in Mille Lacs and you

10

look at the reasoning that this Court put

11

forward for the -- for what constitutes

12

termination of Indian treaty rights --

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But in that -- in

14

that decision, we did not overrule Race Horse.

15

We said that Race Horse meant that statehood

16

did not automatically terminate the prior

17

treaty right, automatically, but that certain

18

language in the Race Horse treaty was still

19

sufficient to terminate the treaty right.

20

the language in the Race Horse treaty is the

21

exact same language at issue in this treaty.

And

22

What's -- so why shouldn't we have the

23

same result here that we had in Race Horse, and

24

that's the part of Race Horse that is preserved

25

on page 207 by Mille Lacs?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

MR. HICKS:

Justice Kavanaugh, I -- I

2

don't think you expressly overruled the outcome

3

in Race Horse, but I think that you did reject

4

all the legal reasoning that led to the Race

5

Horse results.

6

I mean, you rejected the equal footing

7

doctrine holding.

8

and precarious approach to characterizing

9

treaty rights, which was a premise of that

10
11

You rejected the temporary

second -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But -- but we --

12

sorry to interrupt.

13

question of congressional intent, whether the

14

treaty right was terminated by statehood, and

15

we concluded that the language, the right to

16

hunt on unoccupied lands of the United States,

17

was the relevant treaty language, was

18

terminated by Wyoming's statehood, correct?

19
20
21

MR. HICKS:

We concluded that it was a

in Race Horse, but -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

22

preserved, explicitly preserved, on page 207 of

23

the Mille Lacs opinion.

overruled.

25

That part is not

And my question is, if that part of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16

Race Horse was not overruled but was explicitly

2

preserved and, in fact, distinguished from the

3

Chippewa treaty, how can we in this case not

4

apply the same result that was applied in Race

5

Horse, with the exact same treaty language?

6

Which part of the reasoning is wrong there?

7

MR. HICKS:

8

First of all, I don't know that you

9

A couple of responses.

would be applying the results of a prior case.

10

I think you apply your reasoning.

11

that the reasoning that you adopted in the Race

12

Horse -- I'm sorry, in Mille Lacs was that you

13

did not accept this idea that -- that simply

14

characterizing a treaty right as temporary and

15

precarious, such that it could be impliedly

16

terminated by statehood -- and I recognize that

17

you distinguished --

18

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And I think

But -- but we said

19

that there were -- we said unlike the treaty at

20

issue in Race Horse, right, and then we said

21

there was a clearly contemplated event in Race

22

Horse, unlike in -- in the Mille Lacs treaty --

23

MR. HICKS:

24

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

25

That --- and the clearly

contemplated event was the language said

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

hunting on the unoccupied lands of the United

2

States, that that was terminated by statehood,

3

right?

4

MR. HICKS:

No, I don't actually think

5

that you actually went on and said that that

6

particular language was terminated by

7

statehood.

8

Congress did not intend for that particular

9

treaty right to -- to survive statehood.

10

But then you went on.

You recognized the holding that

When you --

11

when you distinguished that particular treaty,

12

the Race Horse treaty, you actually

13

distinguished it by recognizing the express

14

conditions of termination in that treaty, which

15

is unoccupied land --

16

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

18

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

19

Do you think --

So, Mister --- Race Horse is

overruled or not, the result in Race Horse?

20

MR. HICKS:

I think that you did not

21

expressly in haec verba overrule the decision

22

-- the outcome.

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You think it's

24

still good law as to the tribe at issue in Race

25

Horse?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

MR. HICKS:

I think that if -- if the

2

tribe in Race Horse were here, I think that it

3

would have to be arguing that you explicitly

4

overruled it.

5

that here.

6

But I don't think you need to do

I think what you --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Why not?

Go back

7

to Judge Kavanaugh's question.

8

nearly identical.

9

Race Horse is overruled to come to a different

10
11

conclusion?

The language is

Wouldn't we have to say that

How would we distinguish the two?

MR. HICKS:

Well, I think -- I think

12

that you simply need to apply the reasoning

13

that you set forth, the new reasoning in Mille

14

Lacs, to this Crow Tribe treaty, which has

15

never been before the Court.

16

And now, if that creates, you know, a

17

bit of a situation where you've got, you know,

18

the -- the Shoshone-Bannock treaty that was

19

interpreted using old reasoning having the

20

right terminated and, you know, having a --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You know, Justice

22

-- Chief Justice Rehnquist -- I don't know if

23

he was Chief back then -- said that we had --

24

that the majority had effectively overruled

25

Race Horse, and so have commentators.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

So should we just say it?

And you

2

still haven't told me what factually is

3

different between the two treaty provisions --

4

MR. HICKS:

Well, I can --

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that would

6

distinguish them sufficient for us to say we're

7

applying the new logic and this treaty

8

provision fits that new logic, plus it's

9

different from Race Horse, why?

10

You haven't

filled in that blank.

11

MR. HICKS:

Sure.

And -- and I would

12

say that, you know, first of all, I think it

13

would be far more unusual not to apply your

14

controlling precedent on Indian treaty

15

termination, termination of Indian treaty

16

rights, to a treaty that has never been before

17

this Court simply because there's old reasoning

18

to a treaty that has not been before the Court.

19

But if you're looking for distinctions

20

between the treaties, of course, this Court has

21

said, including in Mille Lacs itself, that you

22

don't just look to the identical text of two

23

treaties.

24

look at the history.

25

post-ratification history.

You look at the negotiations.
You look at the

And as we've put forward in our brief,

2

there is nothing in either the text or the

negotiations or the post-ratification history

4

that gives any indication that statehood would

5

have been a terminating event.

6

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

What's different

7

about the Crow treaty, which is 1868, and the

8

Shoshone treaty, 1868, in terms of the

9

negotiations or the intent?

10

exactly the same.

Well, we don't know much

13

about the negotiations or the history of the

14

Shoshone-Bannock treaty because that really

15

wasn't addressed much in the Race Horse

16

decision, but there are -- there are material

17

distinctions between the history in the way

18

that these treaties came about.

19

For example --

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

21
22

These two

treaties?
MR. HICKS:

For the -- the -- the Race

23

Horse treaty, the Shoshone-Bannock treaty, and

24

the Crow Tribe treaty.

25

The Shoshone-Bannock were on the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

complete other side of Wyoming.

2

came about because of different conflicts with

3

settlers.

4

The treaty

The -- the Crow Tribe is on the

5

complete other side of Wyoming.

6

near Yellowstone National Park, which was

7

something that the -- the Race Horse Court was

8

looking at as well.

9

It's nowhere

I mean, there are material

10

distinctions between the way that these two

11

treaties came to be because of the different

12

histories between the two tribes.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But you haven't

14

pointed to anything really specific.

15

concern just is -- is just that if we end up

16

with agreeing with you on the merits, we'll

17

have a result that the same treaty language

18

creates two different results, one for the

19

Shoshone ends at statehood, the treaty right,

20

and the other does not for this, the Crow, even

21

though it's the exact same treaty language.

My

22

And I'd like, if we're going to reach

23

that result, to be able to point to something.

24

And what is that something?

25

MR. HICKS:

Justice Kavanaugh, I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

that if -- if there are different results

2

there, I think that's a consequence of the new

3

reasoning that you set out in Mille Lacs.

4

I think it would be far more unusual not to

5

apply --

6

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And

But that would

7

have been -- sorry to interrupt.

That would

8

have been a reason on page 207 to say the Race

9

Horse decision is gone.

And that's not what we

10

said.

11

And maybe we should have said it's gone, but we

12

didn't.

13

We distinguished the treaty language.

MR. HICKS:

Well, I certainly think

14

that if it gives you heartburn to have two

15

different results because you're applying your

16

latest legal reasoning, I think you can take

17

the extra step.

18

You did so in the Limbach case that we

19

-- that we cited, in the Sunnen case.

20

these are examples where, you know, Limbach

21

actually says so there -- so that there may be

22

no misunderstanding, we hereby expressly

23

overrule this decision that's -- you know, that

24

we probably should have just expressly

25

overruled before.

So --

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I mean,

Official - Subject to Final Review

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how much

2

are you going to have to unwind if you apply --

3

you no longer believe that statehood eliminated

4

the treaty provisions in Race Horse?

5

MR. HICKS:

Nothing, Your Honor,

6

because there's -- there's no other state that

7

has to -- that is operating under this.

8

There's no other state aside from Wyoming that

9

has been free of recognizing Indian treaty

10
11

rights.
So that's not a consideration.

And

12

there's been no suggestion or evidence that

13

Wyoming has ever relied on this particular Race

14

Horse treaty in the way that it has formulated

15

its -- its natural resource management or in

16

the way that it --

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you'd

18

still have the result that concerns Justice

19

Kavanaugh, that under the exact same language,

20

the two different tribes are going to be

21

treated differently.

22

MR. HICKS:

But I think that's a

23

consequence of the Mille Lacs reasoning, which

24

is your most recent controlling precedent on

25

interpreting the termination of Indian treaty

What do you say to

the suggestion that we just be done with Race

MR. LIU:

The government would be fine

with that.

We would invite the Court to

20

overrule Race Horse.

21

that, in our view, it's not necessary to take

22

that extra step.

23

treaties have the same language, this is a

24

different treaty than the treaty that was

25

before this Court in Race Horse.

I do want to make clear

Even though these two

It governs a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25

different tribe on different lands.

2

And so I think this Court is still

3

faced with the question, even though the

4

language is the same, about whether to extend

5

the erroneous reasoning of Race Horse to a new

6

context.

7
8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Would you please

stop talking in generalities?

9

MR. LIU:

10

Oh, sure.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Give me a specific

11

in which way are the two tribes or their

12

history different?

13

MR. LIU:

Well, Your Honor, to be

14

frank, I -- I don't think there -- the

15

government isn't going to be able to point to a

16

difference in the history.

17

Horse itself was wrong.

18

We just think Race

But I think the question is still,

19

should you extend that reasoning to a new

20

context?

21

reasons you might want to extend it is this --

22

this interest in uniformity, but I think it's

23

important to remember that that -- that

24

uniformity rationale just isn't going to work

25

here.

You know, one of the -- one of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

The Shoshone-Bannock Tribe, which was

2

the tribe involved in the Race Horse decision,

3

has its reservation in Idaho.

4

Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit for decades

5

have said Race Horse is already a dead letter.

6
7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Why do you think Race

Horse wasn't over -- overruled?

8
9

And the Idaho

MR. LIU:

I think for the simple

reason, Justice Kagan, that the Race Horse

10

treaty just wasn't before the Court in Mille

11

Lacs and --

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but it does try

13

to distinguish it.

Now I have to say I've read

14

that paragraph three times, and I still really

15

have no idea what it's talking about.

16

(Laughter.)

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But it does try to

18

distinguish it.

19

are two kinds of rights and -- and some are --

20

two kinds of termination points for a treaty,

21

and some are clearly contemplated and some

22

aren't.

23

It has this view that there

What it never tells you is how that

24

distinction relates at all to the statehood

25

question that's before us and that was before

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

Mille Lacs.

2

something in its head about how these treaties

3

are different and why that matters.

4
5

But -- but it does -- there's

And I guess I'm looking to you to tell
me what I don't understand about it.

6

MR. LIU:

I think you're right,

7

Justice Kagan.

8

think, the paragraph that -- that troubles all

9

of us is a distinction between the 1868 treaty

10

that was at issue in Race Horse and the -- and

11

the 1837 treaty that was at issue in Mille

12

Lacs.

13

That middle sentence and, I

But, number one, I -- I think it's

14

important to read that sentence within the

15

context of everything around it, and I -- and I

16

think everything around it makes clear that the

17

reasoning in Race Horse is no longer good.

18

Even that sentence itself doesn't provide any

19

affirmative reason why Race Horse was correct.

20

As you noted, it's just a -- a grounds

21

for distinguishing Race Horse.

So you couldn't

22

look at that sentence and say Race Horse

23

actually reached the right result.

24

you look at the terminating events that those

25

two sentences themselves identify as

In fact, if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

terminating events under the treaty in Race

2

Horse, statehood isn't one of those either.

3

It focuses on the text.

It focuses on

4

-- on whether the land is unoccupied and still

5

owned by the United States.

6

flows nicely from the beginning of that

7

paragraph, which says that the inquiry should

8

be on the circumstances that the treaty itself

9

identifies.

10

That actually

So I think, read as a whole, this

11

paragraph is about what the proper focus of the

12

inquiry should be.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Counsel, you

14

are -- for the government, you are walking a

15

really thin tightrope here.

16

in terms of whether the land is occupied, it

17

depends on the real question whether there are

18

settlers there, whether there are people there.

19

You're saying that

And yet you say when it comes to the

20

Bighorn National Forest or park, you say, well,

21

maybe it's occupied if we, the government, say

22

we don't want people coming on here.

23

It seems to me that the test has to be

24

the same for the United States' property at

25

Bighorn and for the other property in Wyoming.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

MR. LIU:

I -- I think that's right,

2

Mr. Chief Justice.

We're not asking that a

3

different test be applied to the federal

4

government.

5

occupied is whether that land has been settled.

Our test for whether land is

6

Now it can be settled --

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

8
9
10

Has been

settled?
MR. LIU:

It can be settled --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The whole

11

point of Bighorn is that you don't want that

12

land settled.

13

MR. LIU:

And -- and -- and that --

14

that's true.

The -- the -- by designating the

15

land as a national forest, the federal

16

government has prevented private settlement.

17

What we're saying is that there are

18

things the federal government can do, just like

19

private settlers can do, that can result in the

20

land being occupied.

21

buildings, roads, campsites, recreation areas.

22

We too can build

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how much

23

is enough?

I mean, if you have the little --

24

you know, a little shed for the ranger, does

25

that allow you to say, well, these, you know,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

100,000 acres are occupied?

2

MR. LIU:

No, we wouldn't -- we

3

wouldn't say that -- that putting a shed in one

4

place occupies that much land.

5

good piece of guidance is our regulation, which

6

we cite in our brief, which prohibits discharge

7

of a firearm within 150 yards of a building or

8

a home.

9

area --

I think a -- a

And so we -- we would consider the

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

11

the land if nobody can fire a gun in it?

12

MR. LIU:

So you occupy

No, it's -- it's 150 yards

13

around a -- a campsite, a building, a

14

residence, or other occupied area.

15

-- we would take the -- the development of the

16

land as sort of the anchor point and then look

17

around 150 yards, and that would be the land --

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

So we would

Just so I

19

understand, so at 151 yards, Mr. Herrera could

20

take an elk?

21

MR. LIU:

At a hundred and -- correct.

22

I mean, there has to be some line that we draw

23

between land that's occupied and unoccupied.

24

-- I think there is some burden on the hunter

25

to know where he or she can hunt.

And I think

I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

seeing a building 150 yards away is not too

2

much to ask.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Counsel, along those

4

lines, you asked for remand for an evidentiary

5

exploration of whether the land here was

6

occupied.

7

point out that the district court didn't rely

8

on the occupation as a basis for its relying on

9

the Tenth Circuit opinion.

10

MR. LIU:

11

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

At the same time, though, you -- you

Right.
Seems there's some

12

tension there to me.

13

help me out why there isn't.

14

allow a remand for that?

15

argument raised in this Court for the first

16

time.

17

Maybe not.

Maybe you can

Why should we

You know, it's a new

Why should we address it at all?
MR. LIU:

I -- I -- I think -- I think

18

the district court -- I think the state trial

19

court in this case, to be more precise, did --

20

was open to having an evidentiary hearing from

21

the get-go, and it was only after the state

22

trial court determined that the issue could be

23

resolved as a matter of law that that

24

evidentiary hearing was canceled.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So, fine, we -- we

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

could remand it back, but do we need to say

2

anything about this at all?

3

MR. LIU:

Oh, not at all.

I -- I

4

think the government was -- was -- was trying

5

to be helpful in trying to formulate some sort

6

of test and flesh that out.

7
8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

All right.

one more question for you then.

9

MR. LIU:

10

I've got

That helps.

Sure.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The government says

11

that the state retains some conservation

12

easement here.

13

MR. LIU:

Right.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That -- I don't know

15

where it comes from, but you -- you tell us

16

that such a thing exists.

17

At the same time, though, the treaty

18

says that -- that the tribe is allowed to hunt

19

on the land until the game are gone --

20

MR. LIU:

Right.

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- which seems to

22

suggest that the white man can eliminate all

23

the game.

24

How can that be?

25

But now you say the Indian cannot.

MR. LIU:

I -- I think it goes back to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

the basis of the conservation necessity

2

doctrine.

3

that does not confer the exclusive right to

4

hunt on the Indians.

5
6

It is a gloss on treaty language

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

that, if the treaty were silent about the game.

7

MR. LIU:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

I don't understand

Yeah.
But the treaty is

express, and it contemplates no conservation.

10

It contemplates the complete elimination of the

11

game by the white man.

12

MR. LIU:

Yeah.

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So, if the white man

14

gets to eliminate the game, again, counsel for

15

the government, how come the Indian may not?

16

MR. LIU:

I -- I think it just goes

17

back to the fact that these treaties are -- are

18

more or less written against the backdrop of

19

states being able to exercise some conservation

20

authority because the right is not exclusive.

JUSTICE ALITO:

All right.

When you say we don't

MR. LIU:

No.

I -- I think the way to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

deal with the issue preclusion issue, Your

2

Honor, is -- is to conclude that that issue has

3

been not raised or passed upon below, that

4

either it's been forfeited or that it can be

5

pursued on remand.

6

The federal government would -- would

7

not invite this Court to address the actual

8

merits of these various issue preclusion

9

doctrines.

We agree that these issues are

10

difficult and the circumstances of this case

11

are particularly unusual because the

12

alternative judgment that was inserted into the

13

case by the Tenth Circuit in Repsis was done so

14

at the appellate level and not in the court of

15

first instance.

16

And not even Restatement Section 27

addresses this precise instance.

18

would caution the Court against delving into

19

these tricky preclusion issues.

20

So we -- we

We do think the issue was not raised

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN G. KNEPPER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

5
6

MR. KNEPPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

7

Mr. Herrera's claims are identical to

8

those presented 25 years ago by his sovereign

9

on his behalf in the case Crow Tribe v.

10

Repsis.

11

Nothing since Repsis, including the

12

decision by this Court in Mille Lacs, merits a

13

-- an exception to this Court's repeated

14

command that, once the appeals are over, a

15

final judgment binds the parties and they may

16

not renew the same dispute in another forum.

17

Repsis ruled that this particular

18

treaty right had expired, and this Court should

19

not on collateral review allow it to spring

20

back, especially as, when you look at the

21

decision in Mille Lacs, Mille Lacs went out of

22

its way not to overrule the result in Race

23

Horse.

24
25

Much of -- much of the -- the argument
over preclusion, Your Honor, has to do with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

whether there has been a change in intervening

2

law, and this case is particularly ill-suited

3

to find such a change.

4

The treaty text has not changed.

5

There are no essential facts that have changed,

6

because, when one looks at the underlying case

7

brought by the Crow Tribe, in the complaints

8

and the Joint Appendix, it was brought at the

9

broadest possible level of abstraction.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Maybe I'm not

11

understanding this correctly because it's

12

complicated, but I thought there are two

13

separate issues in respect to issue preclusion.

25

question.

A totally different

And there, not with Repsis, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

basic argument is the law changed in Mille

2

Lacs.

3

It doesn't in the Restatement or where

4

we've quoted the Restatement, which we have in

5

a number of cases, Bobby v. Bies, Limbach v.

6

Hooven, et cetera, we haven't said that you are

7

free to bring a new issue only where the court

8

has overruled the case that came against you.

9

We said you're free to bring a new one

10

when there's a change in the applicable legal

11

context.

12

there is a change in the applicable legal

13

context.

14

and you win.

Two, no more just become a state

15

and you win.

Okay?

applicable legal context since Race Horse

17

relied on those two things.

That's a change in the

Now that's my understanding of the

19

argument.

explain what the standing -- what the correct

21

argument is, or answer those points.

22

So either tell me I'm wrong and

MR. KNEPPER:

Okay.

Your Honor, the

23

-- there's not complete clarity within this

24

Court's jurisprudence as to what kind of a

25

change in the legal context is sufficient.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39

Some say, you know, Stauffer Chemical

2

talks about a significant change or a major

3

doctrinal shift.

4

in Bobby v. Bies says just a change in the

5

applicable law.

6

The -- you know, the language

You know, from -- from the state's

7

perspective, if -- if any change to a precedent

8

relied upon by a prior court, either it's

9

called into question by this Court or it's

10

called into question by a court of appeals in

11

some subsequent cases is sufficient to undo the

12

preclusive effect of the first opinion, then I

13

think there are very few cases that will have

14

preclusive effect because, you know, one need

15

only go through the opinion and say:

16

this -- this case was cited by the court

17

somewhere, and -- and by citing that case, they

18

must have relied upon it and -- and, boy, look

19

over here, there -- there's another case that

20

has -- that has questioned it, not being

necessarily overruled.

But, Mr. Knepper, I --

23

I think this isn't just any change.

I -- I

24

think a fair reading would suggest that what

25

Mille Lacs did was to repudiate the reasoning

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

that Race Horse had in it with respect to

2

exactly the question before us.

3

And it's true that it did not go all

4

the way to overruling the case, but it -- it

5

came up like half a step short of that.

6

basically said the case was wrong, and then it

7

found some distinction that wasn't even

8

relevant to the question and said we don't have

9

to overrule it because there is this

10

It

distinction.

11

But all the reasoning is repudiated.

12

Wouldn't you think -- wouldn't you say that

13

that's right?

14

MR. KNEPPER:

Your Honor, the court

15

did not overrule the approach to treaty

16

interpretation.

17

what the intent of the parties is.

18

It said the key is looking at

It reached a conclusion that -- that a

19

court today might not reach.

20

different conclusion.

21

the court should have said something different

22

is -- is at root the argument that the court --

23

that the -- that the -- that the decision was

24

wrong.

25

It might reach a

But that argument that

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, just to make

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

this more concrete, I mean, as I understand it,

2

Race Horse essentially said that these treaty

3

rights expired upon statehood.

4

comes in and says that's a wrong thing to say.

5

Treaty rights don't expire upon statehood.

6
7

And Mille Lacs

So that seems like a pretty relevant
change in the law.

8

MR. KNEPPER:

Well, Your Honor,

9

there's -- there's -- there's one subtlety, I

10

think, from the 19th Century law to the 20th

11

Century law that's being overlooked here, and

12

that is this Court's decision in Lone Wolf v.

13

Hitchcock.

14

party believed that Congress could unilaterally

15

overrule or repeal a treaty.

16

It was not until 1903 that any

That -- the assumption in the 19th

17

Century was there had to be bargained-for

18

consideration.

19

when it's looking at this treaty question, is

20

saying:

21

And so the Race Horse court,

What was the intent of the parties?
And it reaches the conclusion that the

22

intent of the parties was -- and this is

23

restated from Mille Lacs -- that this was a --

24

it was clearly contemplated that this would be

25

a temporary hunting right so long as the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

hunting grounds remained unoccupied and owned

2

by the United States and that that terminated

3

at statehood.

4

Now it was -- it was not terminated by

5

-- it was not so much that the statehood as a

6

legal act made it terminate.

7

treaty itself envisioned termination at

8

statehood.

9

it would terminate at statehood, the treaty did

10
11

It was that the

And because the parties agreed that

so.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The oddity is

12

that, as Justice Kagan says, in Mille Lacs, we

13

say that the holding of Race Horse or the

14

reasoning that statehood automatically

15

terminates treaty rights for off-reservation

16

activity, that's no longer good, and then, on

17

the alternative holding, as we characterized it

18

from Rate -- Race Horse, we say that language,

19

the precar -- temporary and precarious, that

20

language is also no good.

21

Right?

Even on the alternative holding, it's

22

not as if the Court in Mille Lacs said:

23

everything from Race Horse is good on the

24

alternative holding.

25

recharacterized it or something.

Oh,

It either ditched it or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

How would you make sense of what the
rule is that's preserved by Mille Lacs?

3

MR. KNEPPER:

I think, Your Honor, the

4

rule preserved by Mille Lacs is that the treaty

5

language that was present in Race Horse, which

6

is identical to the treaty language in the Crow

7

-- the treaty with the Crows, expresses an

8

intent by the parties that the off-reservation

9

hunting right would terminate at statehood.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

language right here in Mille Lacs:

12

rights are not impliedly terminated upon

13

statehood.

14

contrary, was informed by that court's

15

conclusion that the Indian treaty rights were

16

inconsistent with state sovereignty.

17

it goes on to say that's not so.

18

read it to you, but isn't that what it says?

19

Well, you have this
Treaty

The Race Horse decision, to the

And then

I mean, I can

And so treaty rights are not implied.

20

Now that would seem like a change in the law

21

because they said in Race Horse treaty rights

22

were impliedly -- the Indian treaty rights were

23

impliedly repealed by statehood of Wyoming.

MR. KNEPPER:

Your Honor --

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- I don't see how

you can get more opposite.
MR. KNEPPER:

You tell me.

-- Your Honor, I think

4

there are -- there -- the critical question --

5

and this sort of goes to what the text of

6

Article IV speaks of, which was, you know --

7

and -- and I may refer to Race Horse several

8

times, not just because it's binding precedent

9

but also because it's the clearest evidence

10

that we have before us of what 19th Century

11

thinkers thought the language meant.

12

In other words, it -- it has a -- it

13

has a historical value as well, all of these

14

decisions were made during the 19th Century.

15

And -- and the Court in that case looked at the

16

treaty text and said:

17

could be construed broadly, it could be

18

construed narrowly, but when construed in pari

19

materia with the language of borders of the

20

hunting districts, it applies only to lands of

21

such a character as would be embodied in

22

hunting districts.

23

a term of art.

24
25

"Unoccupied lands," that

And the Court read that as

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
that's wonderful.

All right.

So

Tell me how a national park

isn't a traditional hunting district.

2

the government says we're not going to keep it

3

unoccupied.

They open it up to hunting.

4

What was different back then?

5

MR. KNEPPER:

6

Your Honor, I --

that's --

7
8

I mean,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Unoccupied and

people went hunting.

9

MR. KNEPPER:

Well, Your Honor, that's

10

where the Race Horse Court's evaluation of the

11

history at that time is so important because

12

the Race Horse Court looked at Yellowstone

13

National Park, and what the Race Horse Court

14

said was Yellowstone National Park was created

15

almost immediately after the treaty with the

16

Crows was signed.

17

Park is actually within the Crow hunting

18

district.

19

very large area, but Yellowstone National Park,

20

which is an area the size of Connecticut, it's

21

not just geysers, was carved out of the hunting

22

district, and then the United States proceeded

23

over the entire time, beginning in 1872 and

24

then through the '80s, 1880s, to say to tribes:

25

You may not hunt here.

The -- Yellowstone National

And the Crow hunting district is a

This is off limits.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

We

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

have occupied this land.

2

Now that doesn't mean that there are

3

structures there, but that the -- that the --

4

the federal government's arrival and the

5

federal government's setting this land aside

6

has the effect of occupying the land, and that

7

the -- the tribe does not require -- or the

8

treaty does not require only -- that the tribe

9

refrain from hunting only on land where it can

10

identify a structure.

11
12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
--

13
14

Can I -- can we just

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I

know --

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Oh, I'm sorry.

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I know that

17

when we're interpreting a treaty, we look at

18

the background and circumstances in

19

interpreting the language, and -- but your

20

argument's a pretty stark distinction, occupied

21

doesn't really have anything to do with

22

hunting.

23

saying, well, when they said "occupied," they

24

meant outside the hunting district.

25

a bit of a stretch.

And yet you're -- you're sort of

And that's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

I know we try to look at the

2

background to illuminate the language, but,

3

here, it seems to me you're just substituting

4

an entirely different concept.

5

MR. KNEPPER:

Your Honor, I -- I think

6

that the precise question is what did they mean

7

by "occupied" and what -- what -- what was land

8

-- what did land have to look like in --

9

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Yeah, but your

10

argument is, you know, what did they mean by

11

"cow" and you're saying they meant "horse."

12

They're two totally different concepts.

13

MR. KNEPPER:

I -- I'm not -- I'm not

14

sure that's what the State's argument is, but

15

--

16

(Laughter.)

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

18
19

I'm sure it's

not.
MR. KNEPPER:

But -- but I -- I think

20

-- I think there are -- there are -- you know,

21

you can envision, for example, a piece of

22

private land where there is no -- there are no

23

structures, and in that piece of private land,

24

I think there's no question Mille Lacs affirms

25

this, that there would be no right to hunt on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

that piece of private land, even though it

2

looks like nothing, it looks like a vast

3

expanse of nothing.

4

And so then the question is, when the

5

government has a specific purpose for which it

6

reserves land, and the government has done so

7

and did so throughout the 19th Century in terms

8

of military reservations for forts, which is a

9

larger portion of land than just the fort

10

itself, as well as public reservations, which

11

would be either the national forest or the

12

national parks, the government has said not --

13

not that this land is unoccupied but, rather,

14

we occupy this land.

15

dictate who comes in, who comes out, what

16

they're allowed to do while they're there.

17

This -- we have -- we have taken this land over

18

and managed it in a completely different way.

19

From -- from the -- from the State's

This is our land.

We

20

perspective, it's one of the reasons why we're

21

not concerned about some of the -- the

22

questions of whether Mr. Herrera -- whether the

23

United States could solve this another way.

24
25

In other words, this is a federal -- a
national forest.

The current regulations for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

the national forest say you can only hunt in

2

the national forest if you have either

3

permission from the -- the forest

4

superintendent or you're hunting in conjunction

5

with a state memorandum of understanding.

6

The state memorandum of understanding

7

for the Bighorn National Forest makes no

8

reference whatsoever to hunting outside of

9

Wyoming's permitting regime.

10

Now, if the United States wants a

11

different regime on its property, the United

12

States is free to provide that different regime

13

and free to make distinctions.

Is that it?

You were -- you

sound like you were mid-sentence to me, but --

6

MR. KNEPPER:

Well, Your Honor, I

7

wanted to explain one of the reasons why the

8

State is so concerned about this concept of

9

change in law, especially in the context of

10

Indian treaties and jurisdictional questions,

11

because I think the greatest reason for caution

12

here is we have two eternal sovereigns.

13

Crow Tribe will be here forever, as they have

14

been since time immemorial, and the State of

15

Wyoming has no intention of disappearing.

16

The

And our concern with -- with sort of a

17

-- with sort of a -- a notion that the change

18

in law is all that's necessary to remove

19

preclusion is that it creates the possibility

20

that people -- that parties just lurk, that

21

they wait and wait.

22

doctrine in a specific area of law may not

23

change over 10 or 20 or even 100 years, but

24

when you have two parties that will continue to

25

exist for more than a --

And, you know, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

But what you have is,

2

look, Race Horse, it says, your side, for two

3

or three reasons, reason 1, the equal footing

4

doctrine.

5

if there is a reason 3, it's related to the

6

second.

7

Reason 2, they became a state.

And

Along comes Mille Lacs and it says

8

reason 1 is no good.

We think the opposite.

9

Reason 2 is no good.

We think the opposite.

10

Reason 3 we think isn't any good either.

We

words Race Horse is overruled, but the Court

18

lot of things to do every day, and you have to

19

write your opinions and you start putting in a

20

word like "overruled" and some of your

21

colleagues might think:

22

know what you're getting, et cetera.

23

have to decide for this case is that Race Horse

24

doesn't bind us, okay?

25

I can understand that.

I can perhaps

But the three big reasons, now, are

8

And, therefore, I thought maybe it fits within

9

what you're talking about.

It has to be a

10

fairly big deal in change.

It sounds like a

11

big deal.

12

And then you have another argument,

13

which is, of course, that we will get to

14

perhaps, it's not unoccupied.

15

more open, but you have the problem that the

16

treaty is filled with that word "unoccupied"

17

seeming to mean not occupied by white settlers.

18

And that's what the government thinks.

And, there, it's

19

Well, the language in the treaty's supporting

20

that.

And are there any white settlers in that

21

park?

No, not one to my knowledge.

22

there's a games keeper.

23

that -- that's how I'm understanding your case.

say that as a -- on -- on the basis of the

equal footing doctrine, that -- that the treaty

gives you -MR. KNEPPER:

Your Honor, the -- the

decision rests on the conclusion that

19

unoccupied lands must be of the character of

the lands denominated as hunting districts, and

21

that hunting districts were a specific kind of

land understood, and that upon settlement, and,

So, if the

United States had changed the General Land

19

20

that terminated the treaty?

21

MR. KNEPPER:

I think that if what

22

you're asking is are there unoccupied lands

23

within the meaning of the treaty anymore within

24

the State of Wyoming, that's -- that's what the

25

decision both in Race Horse and in -- and in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

Repsis concluded, that those -- those lands --

2

those lands have disappeared.

3

exist within the State of Wyoming.

4

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

They no longer

Can I ask about

5

the practical consequences of the decision?

6

Because, as Justice Gorsuch said to the

7

opposing counsel, there is still preserved in

8

the cases a right in the state to regulate in

9

the interest of conservation.

Doesn't that

10

mitigate and maybe solve the concern that you

11

talked about with the state existing forever

12

and the tribe existing forever?

13

The way they can coexist, our case law

14

says, is the state still retains a right to

15

regulate in the interest of conservation.

16

isn't that good -- good enough?

17

MR. KNEPPER:

Why

Your Honor, conservation

18

necessity is not a middle ground from the

19

state's perspective, and the chief reason is

20

because the law enforcement officers who act

21

don't know whether they have jurisdiction until

22

after they have done so.

23

So -- so -- so, in other words, we

24

have -- we have an officer out enforcing law in

25

either an area or in a certain -- in a certain

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

circumstance, and the question is he -- he or

2

she acts and then only after a period of

3

litigation does he actually find out that he

4

had the authority to do so.

5

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I don't -- I don't

6

follow that, because if -- if we were to adopt

7

that -- approve of the conservation principle

8

that the government urges and the American

9

Congress does too, you would have your game

10

wardens out and about ensuring that people are

11

not hunting during off-season, for example.

12

And if they're allowed to go on the

13

forest land by agreement with the United

14

States, why then how would there be any

15

ambiguity about their capacity to issue

16

citations?

17
18
19

I'm just not clear about how
litigation would be required to resolve that.
MR. KNEPPER:

Your Honor, leaving

20

aside the question of whether there's agreement

21

with the United States, right, that obviously

22

solves all problems.

23

And that has nothing to do with anything

MR. KNEPPER:

Well, the Congress in

this case has given the state the authority to
act.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.

So, okay, so

12

we can put that one aside.

So, again, what

13

ambiguity remains in -- in response to Justice

14

Kavanaugh's question?

15

MR. KNEPPER:

The current -- the

16

current vision of conservation necessity, which

17

has not admittedly been decided by this Court

18

in any time -- any time recently, is sort of --

19

is a reverse preemption doctrine.

20

essentially that the state is pushed out of an

21

area of traditional state concern and then it's

22

on -- the burden is upon the state to show that

23

it has the need to come in and manage and --

24

and -- and only after sort of demonstrating at

25

the end of it that this particular activity, be

2

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But is it just a

3

timing issue then, because -- or is there some

4

gap between what you want to regulate and what

5

you can regulate under the conservation

interest?

7

9

MR. KNEPPER:
significant gaps.

Your Honor, there are

The two --

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Okay.

What --

what -- give me some examples so we can

11

understand the practical consequences.

12

MR. KNEPPER:

The most important, Your

13

Honor, is safety.

14

specifically limited in time.

15

protects the wildlife, but it has two effects

16

beyond that.

17

recreating in the national forest or anywhere

18

else outside of that time period, there is no

19

danger -- you know, individuals who are using

20

firearms at that point have very, very little

21

justification for doing so.

22

Hunting seasons are
That not only

It ensures that when people are

And so there are people, and -- and

23

I'm one of them, that won't take our children

24

into the national forest during hunting season

25

because there just -- there are risks there

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

that -- that are -- that are -- that are --

2

that are too much to overcome.

3

There are limits in terms of when you

4

can fire your firearms.

It has to be at

5

certain hours of the day.

6

There are requirements that if you are

7

hunting you are wearing vests so you're clearly

8

visible to one another, as well as to -- as

9

well as to third-parties.

10

Beyond -- beyond sort of the immediate

11

safety concerns, which are not embodied in

12

conservation necessity, there are disease

13

management concerns.

14

When -- when an individual takes an --

15

an elk or a deer in conjunction with -- with a

16

state license, the Fish and Game Department

17

will -- will take a sample of that animal and

18

use it to determine whether diseases like

19

Brucellosis, which can be captured -- caught

20

both by wild game animals, as well as by human

21

beings, are -- are -- are present.

22

also --

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There are

But isn't that

covered by conservation?
MR. KNEPPER:

Your Honor, I don't -- I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62

mean, conservation necessity to my sense has

2

always been about ensuring that the game exists

3

and -- and preventing its extermination, not

4

the sort of --

5

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Doesn't --

doesn't disease interfere with that?
MR. KNEPPER:

In some cases, it can,

Your Honor.

bison who have Brucellosis seem to be able to

10

function just fine within their reproductive

11

capacities.

12

In others, you know, the -- the

It's domestic cattle that cannot.

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, in -- in many

13

other Indian cases, the language has been used

14

that ordinary regulation is not foreclosed,

15

which sometimes is elaborated health, safety,

16

environment, for example.

17

reason that that would be different here?

18

MR. KNEPPER:

And is there any

Your Honor, I -- I -- if

19

-- if that -- if that were the theory, and that

20

the theory were that --

JUSTICE BREYER:

22

23

been looking at.

24
25

MR. KNEPPER:

It's the theory in

I mean, that's what I've

You know, from -- from

the State's perspective, what we're -- what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

we're looking at is the sort of extensive

2

litigation that we have not yet engaged in, but

3

also what the United States suggests in its

4

brief as sort of the approach that it would

5

take to conservation necessity, which suggests,

6

for example, that -- that different levels of

7

mule deer population or elk population on a

8

year-by-year basis would affect the interests

9

of the state in conservation.

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But, if safety

11

were added, as Justice Breyer said, that solves

12

the primary problem you identified, right?

13

MR. KNEPPER:

It -- it certainly

14

solves -- solves at least one of them.

15

are -- you know, there are other questions.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There

We're forgetting

17

the other side in this discussion, because the

18

tribe has a subsistence right.

19

the facts of this case you're claiming the

20

killings were not for subsistence, an open

21

question, I'm not taking a side on that.

22

I know under

But assuming that the treaty right was

23

given to -- to protect the Indian subsistence

24

rights and that their claim, taking it at face

25

value, is accurate, that they were on hard

Heritage Reporting Corporation

times and needed food to feed their families,

2

that balance is not yours alone to make.

3

belongs to the government and it belongs to the

4

Indian tribes as well.

5

MR. KNEPPER:

It

Your Honor, that's why

6

the State has been so accepting.

7

State does not resist the notion that, as

8

proprietor, the United States could come in and

9

give all of the benefits that Mr. Herrera

10

I mean, the

seeks, including subsistence hunting.

11

What -- what -- what the advantage of

12

that approach would be is that all of the

13

questions that -- that -- that sort of tail out

14

of that, when, how, but also subsistence,

15

subsistence for whom, you know, the question of

16

hunting licenses being given to the tribe

17

rather than under the current situation where,

18

you know, the United States' position as to the

19

Crow treaty was not made clear to the State of

20

Wyoming until the filing in this Court in -- in

21

support of a grant of certiorari.

22

The United States had -- had no role

23

whatsoever in the Repsis litigation that we can

24

find.

25

declined to participate at all.

In fact, I believe the United States

Heritage Reporting Corporation

65

And so, from -- from the State's

2

perspective, the absence of the federal

3

government is -- is one, you know, we would

4

welcome the federal government's involvement.

5

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

6

JUSTICE ALITO:

It won't --

On the land in

7

question here, what is the extent of the

8

federal government's regulatory authority and

9

where does it come from?

10

MR. KNEPPER:

The -- the federal

11

government's regulatory authority comes from

12

the Organic Act that created the national

13

forests.

14

was -- there was a statute allowing creation of

15

the national forests.

16

reaffirmed in 1897, the so-called Organic Act

17

allows the federal government to just -- do

18

just about anything.

19

California Commission, this Court said it's

20

plenary.

21

There's a -- there's a gap.

There

And then, when they were

And in the Coastal

JUSTICE ALITO:

Does the government

22

think that that abrogated the or that limited

23

the treaty right?

24

MR. KNEPPER:

The government's

25

perspective is that it did not.

The State's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

perspective is that it occupied it by -- by

2

taking control.

3

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, then -- then how

4

can the government -- I mean, the government is

5

just as bound by the -- by the -- is bound by

6

the treaty.

7

treaty, right?

The government entered into the

8

MR. KNEPPER:

9

into the treaty, yes.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

The government entered

So doesn't there have

11

to be a statute that would limit the hunting

12

right that was conferred by the treaty?

13
14

MR. KNEPPER:

Your Honor, may I

respond?

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

MR. KNEPPER:

Sure.

All of these actions

17

took place, Your Honor, before statutes could

18

repeal Indian treaty language, all -- including

19

the enactment of the organic statute.

20

So, from the State's perspective, all

21

of them represent not repeal of the hunting

22

right but, rather, the federal government's

23

occupation within the meaning of the hunting

24

right.

25

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

counsel.

3

Mr. Hicks, two minutes.
REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF GEORGE W. HICKS, JR.

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

5

MR. HICKS:

6
7

Justice.

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Just a few points.
First, in response to the idea that

8

Mille Lacs simply didn't change the approach, I

9

-- I think that's wrong for all the reasons

10

that Justice Breyer and Justice Kagan

11

identified.

12

further than the sentence that you read,

13

Justice Breyer.

14

But I want to go a little bit

And it's the sentence on page 207/208.

15

Now earlier in the opinion the Court had said:

16

We concluded that the particular rights in the

17

Race Horse treaty at issue there were not

18

intended to survive statehood.

19

Then on 207/208:

The Race Horse

20

Court's decision that Indian treaty rights were

21

impliedly repealed by Wyoming statehood was

22

informed by that court's conclusion that the

23

Indian treaty rights were inconsistent with

24

state sovereignty over natural resources and,

25

thus, that Congress could not have intended the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1

rights to survive statehood.

2

And that's an important last phrase of

3

that sentence because it's tying the entire

4

Race Horse holding to this mistaken premise

5

that Indian treaty rights are irreconcilable

6

with state sovereignty over natural resources.

7

I think that's a key sentence.

8
9

And I think, frankly, that kind of
undercuts a lot of the idea that even the

10

holding -- this second holding of Race Horse is

11

still viable.

12

to take the next step to expressly overrule the

13

outcome in Race Horse.

14

want to do that, you can follow the roadmap

15

that you have in Limbach and Sunnen, where you

16

had almost exactly this situation.

17

Again, we don't think you need

But, if you, you know,

The second point is simply to this

18

idea of the occupation and what "occupied"

19

means.

20

historical evidence, is that both parties to

21

the treaty understood "occupation" to mean some

22

sort of actual physical presence and nothing

23

about simply a legal declaration that the

24

federal government was going to do something.

25

Everything in the evidence, in the

And certainly, under the Indian canons

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

of construction, that's a reasonable reading

2

that is entitled to be given to the Indians.

3

And the last point on conservation

4

necessity, you know, this discussion I think

5

just demonstrates that if the Court finds that

6

the -- the treaty right is valid and has not

7

been terminated, Wyoming still has the ability

8

to regulate its -- its wildlife, its natural

9

resources, simply according to the conservation

10

necessity standard like every other state

11

already has to do.
