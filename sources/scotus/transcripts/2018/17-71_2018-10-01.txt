Weyerhaeuser Company versus the United States

ORAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

9

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

10
11

MR. BISHOP:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

12

Congress amended the Endangered

13

Species Act in 1978 to narrow the concept of

14

critical habitat, and it did that in response

15

to this Court's decision in Hill and an early

16

regulation that allowed critical habitat

17

designation for population expansion beyond a

18

species' present habitat.

19

that requires designation of critical habitat,

20

Section 4, Congress limited the Service's power

21

to designate to any habitat of such species

22

which is then considered to be critical

23

habitat.

24
25

In the provision

In Section 3(5)(C), Congress commanded
that critical habitat shall not include the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

entire area which can be occupied by a species.

2

And those limitations show that Congress

3

intended that areas that can be occupied by a

4

species -- that is, its habitat -- mark the

5

outer bounds, the outer bounds of critical

6

habitat, and it would be perverse -­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Bishop, may -- may

8

I offer you a hypothetical just to understand

9

the scope of your argument, which is a bit

10

unclear to me?

11

is a species which, like this one, is in only a

12

single habitat, and for whatever reason, that

13

habitat is no longer going to support the

14

species.

15

So, in my hypothetical, there

Disease has come, a predator has come,

16

it's gotten too hot, it's gotten too cold,

17

whatever it is.

18

will be able to support the species.

19

is no habitat that at the present moment -­

20

there is no other habitat that at the present

21

moment is capable of conserving the species

22

over the long term.

23

That single habitat no longer
And there

But there is a habitat that, with only

24

slight improvements, what the government calls

25

reasonable efforts, can support the species.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

Okay?

2

So habitat A where the species is, no

3

longer any good.

4

won't conserve the species if left just as it

5

is, but it only takes reasonable effort to

6

conserve the species.

7
8

Habitat B, it can't -- it

Can the government designate that area
as unoccupied, critical habitat?

9

MR. BISHOP:

No, it has to be habitat.

10

Now, just to be plain, part of the problem with

11

that is that the government -- when the

12

government talks about reasonable changes,

13

which is what -- is what it does here, what

14

would be involved in -- on this piece of land

15

for it to be inhabited -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. BISHOP:

There may -­

20

than reasonable changes that would be involved

here.

Right.

I don't rule out

6

that the government might be able to justify a

7

critical habitat designation when there are de

talking about digging a few holes, where there

is a very minimal change required in the land.

the government views as reasonable changes,

such to allow the land to support the species

Justice Kagan.

MR. BISHOP:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And the reason is -­
Where in the statute

do you find that?

MR. BISHOP:

The statute says it in

three places.

habitat of such species can be designated as

8

critical habitat.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

MR. BISHOP:

It says it in Section

But we know that

habitat -­

11
12

It says in Section 4 that only

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- doesn't mean -­

excuse me, I'm sorry.

15

We know that habitat doesn't mean just

16

where a species lives.

I mean, that's -- that

17

would be the common understanding of the word

18

"habitat," but this statute clearly goes beyond

19

that, and we know because it says -- it's also

20

where a statute -- where a species could live,

21

right?

22

that are outside the geographical area occupied

23

by the species.

It's out -- there are also habitats

24

MR. BISHOP:

But those are -­

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So we know that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

statute is not using the kind of garden-variety

2

definition of habitat.

3

MR. BISHOP:

No, I -- I disagree with

4

that, Justice Kagan.

5

habitat cannot be designated beyond the entire

6

area which can be occupied.

7

thinking about habitat in the sense that it is

8

used in -- in common speech and in the

9

dictionaries, which is a "can be occupied"

3(5)(C) says the critical

Congress was

sense.

11

Convention of -- on Migratory Species, to which

12

we are a signatory, says it's an area which

13

contains suitable living conditions.

14

Let me give you an example:

The 1979

The Forest Service, contemporaneously

15

with these amendments in 1978, said that it's

16

the environment where all the essentials for a

17

species' development and existence are present.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if you use the

19

migratory bird example, then we have here the

20

ephemeral ponds, which are supposed -- supposed

21

to be ideal for breeding, so it's -- it's a

22

habitat that is suitable for breeding.

23

MR. BISHOP:

I disagree with that,

24

Justice Ginsburg.

It's -- it's -- it's

25

incorrect to label that as habitat because the

6

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But is it -- is it

7

-- is it true with -- in -- in the case of

8

birds that they may stay at a place less than a

9

month?

10

MR. BISHOP:

That's an entirely

11

different example, Justice Ginsburg.

12

habitat for a migratory bird includes a summer

13

habitat, a winter habitat, and the places along

14

the way where it has to -- where it roosts.

15

may -- it may prefer particular trees.

16

have a contiguous habitat, and the roosting

17

trees clearly can be listed as critical habitat

18

if they meet the other conditions.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

It

You

If I could go back to

20

the -- the statutory basis for your position,

21

because, to my mind, it is a counterintuitive

22

result that the statute would prefer extinction

23

of the species to the designation of an area

24

which requires only certain reasonable

25

improvements in order to support the species.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

That seems a counterintuitive result,

2

and, as I say, it does not seem a result that's

3

demanded at all by the statutory language,

4

which contemplates that habitats will exist

5

even beyond the areas where a species currently

6

resides.

7

MR. BISHOP:

Justice Kagan, there is a

8

difference between an area -- an unoccupied

9

area that is habitat and an unoccupied area

10

that is not habitat.

19

habitat that can be -­

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That is

It must be

But I think that that

21

was dealing with a very different problem.

22

That was dealing with a problem where a species

23

can reside in many areas outside of the area

24

where it resided, and the statute was making

25

clear that just because that's true, you can't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

go designate all of those areas habitat.

2

But this is a different problem from

3

the problem that we're talking about where

4

there's only a single area that might

5

conceivably prevent extinction of the species.

6

And you're saying that, notwithstanding that it

7

was -- it's only reasonable efforts that would

8

allow it to conserve the species, that's not

9

permitted.

10
11

MR. BISHOP:

It is not.

And there are

clear statutory indications that -­

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, do you -­

13

Mr. Bishop, do you agree with the proposition

14

that the choice in Justice Kagan's hypothetical

15

is between designation of the land as critical

16

habitat and extinction of the species?

17

there not -­

18

MR. BISHOP:

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

20

Are

No.
-- other options

available to the federal government?

21

MR. BISHOP:

There are other options

22

and there are other clues in the statutory

23

language.

24

what this Court said in Sweet Home was that the

25

Section (5) purchase authority was well suited

Apart from section 4 and 3(5)(C),

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

for buying land that is not yet but may in the

2

future become habitat.

3

decision in Sweet Home.

4

That was this Court's

In addition, I would point out the

5

definition of conservation in Section 3.3,

6

which you would think if Congress had in mind

7

that restoration and creation of new habitat,

8

which is what would be required on this land,

9

let there be no doubt, if that was what it had

10

in mind, it would have used one of those terms

11

for the list in 3-3 talks about maintenance of

12

habitat and translocation.

13

about the creation of new habitat or the

14

restoration of habitat back to the period

15

before human intervention.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It does not talk

But -- but I guess

17

what strikes me about the statute, Mr. Bishop,

18

is that really all over the place you get these

19

references to the fact that habitat isn't just

20

sort of there and perfect always, that habitat

21

requires things to be done to it.

22

You know, even in the definition of

23

"occupied critical habitat," it talks about

24

special management that needs to be taken in

25

order to protect the habitat.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

And, similarly, in the definition of

2

"conservation," it talks about, you know, the

3

need for habitat improvement.

4

So -- so all through the statute

5

there's this idea of it's not just an on/off

6

switch, that there is habitat that needs to be

7

maintained, improved, and so forth in order to

8

fulfill the function of preserving a species.

9

MR. BISHOP:

With all due respect,

10

Justice Kagan, I don't think that's right.

11

think that all of those references to habitat

12

are references to maintaining habitat that

13

already exists.

14

I

So -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

May I ask you a

15

preliminary question?

And it concerns whether

16

the landowner's claim is currently ripe.

That

17

is, you are not commanded to do anything.

You

18

don't have to do anything at all to -- to

19

conserve the endangered species.

20

continue the -- what is it, timber farming

21

that's going on.

And you can

22

Now it may be that down the road you

23

will want to do something else with the land,

24

but wouldn't that be the appropriate time to

25

seek exclusion?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14

MR. BISHOP:

No, Justice Ginsburg.

2

The -- the immediate effect of this overlay of

3

a critical habitat on this 1500 acres is a

4

diminution in value of tens of millions of

5

dollars.

economic analysis, that there is an immediate

loss in value.

That is what it says in the agency's

fairly easy to -- easy to see.

Any buyer

coming in will recognize that down the road

11

they have to deal with -- with the critical

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can I go back to a

6

question?

7

this case, it appeared that there was a dispute

8

as to whether this frog could, in fact,

9

survive, maybe not as healthily as it does now,

10

and maybe not for the very long term, but there

11

was evidence that the frog was there for, I

12

think, 10 or 15 years while timber cutting was

13

occurring.

14

As I was reading the evidence in

that there were stumps that the frog might be

able to survive in, as opposed to the canopied

MR. BISHOP:

The definition that we

provided was the definition that we have

23

provided to this Court, which is the dictionary

24

definition from Webster's 3rd, "the physical

25

features that naturally or normally are

preferred by the species," the 1979 convention,

2

"land which contains suitable living

4

And, you know, a picture is worth a

5

thousand words.

In the -- in the Joint

6

Appendix on page 57, there is a photo, albeit a

7

small one, of adult frogs' uplands habitat.

8

And it's a picture of a few trees with a

9

grassland savanna.

And the scientific experts

10

that you refer to, Justice Sotomayor, for

11

example, Lannoo, talk about the habitat that's

12

needed on the uplands as a savanna.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

that could make for survival for the species.

As I read the record, there were

21

suggestions by some of the scientists that what

survive, albeit not robustly, but it could

So, if we drain it, it's going

And if that's what the statute

because, after all, if you can't drain the

swamp, then the air is irrelevant.

10

But if you could drain the swamp
pretty easily, well, then the air is essential
and you better be sure you have it.

Now, on that, the agency has found,

well, it's not that hard to drain the swamp.

they in this case, the Secretary, exceed the

discretion that the statute gives him in

That's a lot.

Now is that how I should look at it?

2

MR. BISHOP:

No, not at all.

The

3

administrative record here shows that this land

4

would have to be totally remade.

5

to be made to look something like that picture

6

on JA 70 -- 77.

It would have

And that burden is not something that

is allowed by language, plain language, in the

statute that requires that the habitat -- the

13

differently.

14

No, we're looking at

You just want me to come out

MR. BISHOP:

I would like to spend a

15

couple minutes, if I may, on judicial review.

16

The court below held that the exclusion

17

decision here is not subject to judicial

18

review.

19

was correct.

20

And the government argues that that

The statutory language of the

21

exclusion decision here, Section 4(b)(2), is

22

that the agency may exclude any area from

23

designation if the Secretary determines that

24

the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits

25

of inclusion.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

So it's not a "may" statement from

2

Congress.

3

these other conditions are met.

4

benefits of exclusion against the benefits of

5

inclusion.

6

It's a "may/if."

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May exclude if
It weighs the

Well, it is a

7

"may/if."

8

it indicates, because of the use of the "may,"

9

rather than the use of a "shall," doesn't it,

10
11

But if the other conditions are met,

that the Secretary still has discretion?
In other words, if the conditions

12

aren't met, then the Secretary can't exclude.

13

But if the conditions are met, the Secretary

14

may exclude if he wants.

15

MR. BISHOP:

Yes, ultimately, there's

16

-- it's a discretionary decision.

I think the

17

question is whether State Farm review of that

18

"if" clause is appropriate.

19

already decided that question in Bennett, a

20

unanimous decision of this Court where it

21

considered both parts of that (b)(2) provision.

22

And the Court said it is rudimentary that

23

discretion as to the substance of the ultimate

24

decision does not confer discretion to ignore

25

the required procedures of decision-making.

Maybe you can help me out with this.

8

suppose for now that I would agree with you and

9

that we could review this.

10

Let's

What more would you expect the

11

Secretary to say, or could say, given the state

12

of scientific evidence before the Secretary?

13

That's not clear to me.

The Secretary

14

says there's -- there's just not any evidence

15

of the benefits of exclusion that I -- that I

16

can put a number on.

17

And isn't -- isn't the way the statute

18

written put some burden of proof incumbent upon

19

the landowner or lessee to come forward with

20

something quantifying the benefits of

21

exclusion?

22

MR. BISHOP:

Right.

Well, certainly,

23

it's permissible for the agency to rely -- to

24

characterize the benefits of inclusion as being

25

biological, which is something that can be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25

described but not quantified.

But, on the other side of that ledger,

3

the agency has to meet State Farm standards in

identifying what the factors -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

on that, my question is, what more would you

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, could you

explain that to me?
MR. BISHOP:

Yes, the inputs into the

4

decision have to be fair and reasonable and the

5

connection between those inputs and the

6

ultimate decision have to be.

7

Let -- let me give an example of a

8

very basic error that -- an example of an

9

internal inconsistency.

10

So the -- the Service refused to

11

factor in the loss of Unit 1 to housing and to

12

St. Tammany's tax base, and it did that because

13

it found that Unit 1 is only 0.5 percent of

14

developable land in the parish.

15

There's a big problem with that.

It

16

included as developable land everything under

17

-- south of Interstate 12, which is not

18

developable because it flooded in Hurricane

19

Katrina, everyone from that area is moving up

20

to -- to us, to the higher ground.

21

It said, in addition, it acknowledged

22

that Unit 1 is particularly attractive for

23

development because Highway 36 runs through it.

24

It's an attractive area for development because

25

it's connected to centers of -- where jobs -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

where the jobs are.

2

And yet -- so we have a Unit 1 that is

3

already zoned, it's outside the flood zone, and

4

it's well served by roads connecting it to

5

jobs, but the Service treated every undeveloped

6

area in the parish as fungible and said this

7

just isn't an important development area, even

8

though St. Tammany, as its brief explains in

9

this case, says no, it's a very important

10
11

development area.
The -- that is what you get when

12

there's no judicial review, when an agency

13

thinks that there are no controls over what it

14

concludes.

15

And the economic analysis is riven

16

through with very basic errors of that kind.

17

And I would submit that without the possibility

18

of judicial review in cases like this, that is

19

what you get, a very unsatisfactory balancing.

20

And that is what State Farm is for.

21

State Farm is there to ensure that when a

22

balancing like this has to be done, when there

23

are multiple factors to be considered, that the

24

agency gets it fairly right as to what those

25

factors are and then connects up the dots

between what those factors are and what its

ultimate conclusion is.

one thing, the designation of critical habitat

serves -- serves a very important function in

And it's also important to recognize

land.

I think your argument

to be spun, we've already heard questions along

this line, as a choice between whether the

Now this case is going

11

That's not the choice at all.

12

The question is, who is going to have

to pay and who should pay for the preservation

of this public good?

15

difficult for a lot of people to shed tears for

guidance on that?

MR. KNEEDLER:

there would be a hard-and-fast rule.

if you -- if you look at the -- if you look at

if development happened without the need for a

qualification of the land to be designated in

And it -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Kneedler, in

your brief, you give a meaning to "habitat"

7

which, frankly, is very different than its

dictionary meaning.

that "habitat can include some areas where a

than what you started your argument with today.

That's very different

It's very different than what you've

14

done with the Santa Ana sucker, for example.

15

If we disagree with you, where does that leave

you in this case?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, if you disagree

about the Santa Ana sucker, that's -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm not -- we're

not looking at that.

21

MR. KNEEDLER:

Okay.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Let's assume I

23

take the dictionary definition of "habitat,"

24

which is the kind of place that is natural for

25

the life and growth of an animal or plant.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

That's a fairly simple, natural place.

Could this -- is this a natural place for this

frog to live?

5

whether some reasonable restoration can be made

6

or not?

7

And, if not, do -- is the

MR. KNEEDLER:

That -- that may in the

8

end be the difference, but -- but I think it's

9

important when -- when you're talking about the

10

definition that you quoted, and we -- we quote

11

a number of them on page 33 of our brief, a

12

number of dictionary definitions, is it the

13

kind of place, is it the kind of site on which

14

the -- on which the species could thrive?

15

And -- and here, the kind of site, I

16

think, is really most commonly understood or

17

defined as the central element, what makes it

18

rare, and that's the pond.

19

place that this frog can live, is in an

20

ephemeral pond and the immediately surrounding

21

uplands?

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, the -- the adult

tadpoles remain in the -- in the pond for much

longer.

6

reasons that this is rendered so rare is that

you have to have an ephemeral pond with

MR. KNEEDLER:

That's what makes this group of ponds

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

about whether the frogs could live in the area

from an ideal place.

But Mr. Bishop said there is no
showing that frogs could live there.
MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, there -- there is

some evidence in the record that we point to

2

where the scientists evaluated the -- the land

3

and found some stumps.

4

as was pointed out, there were frogs located on

this up until 1965, even though there was a

tree farm going on.

7

And -- and there was -­

But one of the reasons that -- this

hasn't been further developed because this

really wasn't the -- the gravamen of the

survive there.

why it's not -- you know, there isn't more

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- Mr. Kneedler,

2

suppose -- if we could just go back to Justice

3

Alito's question, Justice Alito suggested that

4

there were other things that the government is

5

capable of doing to conserve these frogs.

6

So what, consistent with Mr. Bishop's

7

view of the statute, could the government do,

8

is the government enabled to do, that would

9

effectively conserve these frogs?

10

Is there

anything?

11

MR. KNEEDLER:

It does have the

12

authority -- there's a grant program under

13

Section 6 of the Act of grants to states.

14

that would -- the -- the grants to the state is

15

the state would have to decide to become

involved, and those can involve private

conservation groups.

The federal government could purchase

been any indication that they would be.

the Service understandably very rarely

exercises the power of eminent domain.

probably would have the -- the -- the power to

do so.

So far, there hasn't

But the -- none of that -- none of

that undercuts the need, the statutory

obligation to designate critical habitat.

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And -- and this -­

this statute presumes that the designation of

critical habitat is often, almost always, going

to be on private land, isn't that correct?

Is often going to be

MR. KNEEDLER:

It often will be on

private land.

18

And it's important -- it's -- it's important

19

that the Court understand that the limitations

20

the Petitioner would place on the designation

21

of critical habitat would also apply to the

22

government's own land in -- in terms of

limiting the Section 7 consultation process if

MR. KNEEDLER:

Heritage Reporting Corporation

could, but Section 7 of the ESA organizes that

2

by setting up a consultation process such that

3

the action agency can't go -- can't go forward

4

in an area that might harm the species or its

5

habitat without consulting with the agency.

6

That is a very important concept at that time.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Let's go back to my -­

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess what I was

9

suggesting was -- was -- you know, Congress

10

could have passed a statute which just said

11

every time that there's a problem of this kind,

12

the federal government has to purchase the land

13

that will support an endangered species.

14

didn't pass that statute.

15

It

It passed a statute that said that the

16

Secretary could designate critical habitat

17

regardless whether that habitat was on private

18

or public land.

19

And then the question is, where does

20

this requirement of immediacy come from that

21

Mr. Bishop wants to impose?

22
23
24
25

MR. KNEEDLER:

You mean immediate

restoration, do you mean?
JUSTICE KAGAN:

You know, that it has

to be -- that it has to be available to support

49

the species exactly now without any further

2

effort?

3

MR. KNEEDLER:

It is not in the Act at

4

all.

5

conservation is a long-term prospect, not

6

something that has to happen immediately.

And the -- and the whole concept of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But the question and the reason

for the hypothetical is it seems to me that if

you permit the designation of something as

critical habitat that cannot be occupied by the

8

animal, because you think they can do something

9

down the road that will cure the problem,

10

whether it's cut the trees or do anything else,

11

that you ought to be able to articulate what

12

the limit is on what you require down the road.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

I -- I think it's

14

whether -- whether it is a further modification

15

of the habitat in it -- in its existing -- in

16

its existing state.

17

at least where the -- the habitat is being used

18

in a way that is similar to what would be

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

to Justice Gorsuch's or whoever it was -- the

dig up the asphalt, that's -- the use of the

normal whatever, so you couldn't do that under

4

MR. KNEEDLER:

Well, I -- I think -- I

5

think there may be several factors, the size -­

6

the -- the effort involved.

7

one road, that may not be an obstacle.

I mean, if it's

8

If I could just point out there is a

9

-- there is a statutory place to look for the

10

distinction that I'm drawing, and among others,

11

it's in 1533(a)(1)(A), which in designating or,

12

excuse me, listing a species, it directs the

13

Secretary to take -- to determine whether a

14

species may be endangered because of a number

15

of factors.

16

The first one is "the present or

17

threatened destruction, modification, or

18

curtailment of its habitat or range."

19

reference to modification of habitat suggests

20

that even with modification, it's still

21

habitat, even though it's been modified.

22

The

And one of the reasons that land is

23

unoccupied by a species is often precisely

24

because of what has happened, people using the

25

land in a way or transforming the land.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
53

this -- this passage contrasts destruction of

2

the habitat, which would be the case if -- if

3

there was a parking lot or a building or some

5

modification of the habitat, which suggests

that it retains its essential nature.

if this species is going to be conserved, in

Could the Secretary take other actions

MR. KNEEDLER:

basis -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. KNEEDLER:

under the statute.

Right.

-- but not -- it's not

And the question is what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

are the responsibilities -­
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

My question is:

Why

3

isn't it under the statute, given that language

4

that says specifically that the agency -- the

5

agency can take cognizance of the continued

6

existence of any endangered or threatened

7

species, quite apart from preserving its

8

threatened habitat?

9

It seems to me there are two duties

10

that the Secretary has there, and this would

11

fit neatly under at least one of them, if not

12

the second.

13

MR. KNEEDLER:

But the -- the

14

Secretary could, but the -- but the designation

15

of critical habitat, as I said, it's mandatory

16

under the Act.

17

functions, including identifying the area where

18

actions should be taken because of the

19

likelihood here that the frog will need that

20

space to -- to survive.

21

It has -- it has important

Again, I suppose the Secretary could

22

do something on an ad hoc basis, but that's not

23

the framework that the statute set up.

24

set up with rule-making, with public

25

transparency, to be based on science, with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

costs, and weighing of costs.

elaborate process.

4

This is an

And the -- and what the Secretary

5

should do to protect the land and what other

6

agencies should do to protect the land -­

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8

MR. KNEEDLER:

9

The agency -­

-- are part of that

process.

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

The agency does lots

11

of things to protect species, endangered

12

species, beyond protecting their habitat,

13

doesn't it?

14

MR. KNEEDLER:

Yes.

If there's

15

federal land involved, other federal agencies

16

could do it, but the Secretary would have no

17

independent authority with respect to private

18

land, except the designation of critical

19

habitat.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF TIMOTHY S. BISHOP

2

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

3

MR. BISHOP:

Justice Gorsuch, to your

4

point, 7(a)(1) imposes an obligation on all

5

other federal agencies which shall, in

6

consultation with the Secretary, utilize their

7

authorities in furtherance of the purposes of

8

this chapter.

9

Critical habitat is just one part.

10
11

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But that's only if

it's designated critical habitat.

12

MR. BISHOP:

No, no, no, that is a

13

general obligation.

14

whenever you go for a Clean Water Act permit,

15

you don't -- it doesn't have to be -- no

16

critical habitat need be involved.

17

wildlife agencies and FWS immediately gets

18

involved and has to sign off on those.

19

I can tell you that

State

Critical habitat does not have to be

20

involved.

21

this case.

22

here, the properties in Mississippi were

23

restored before there was any critical habitat

24

designation.

25

And there's a perfect example in
If you read the final designation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

doing so, the frog survived in Mississippi

2

through "intense human effort and extensive

3

habitat restoration."

4

That was all done before the critical

5

habitat designation in this case.

6

-- and -- and just to understand here, and to

7

respond to this changes in sync argument that

8

Mr. Kneedler made, there is nothing in sync

9

about creating a -- an open savanna on our

23

We would have

And the idea that the frog scientists

24

here agree with the government is simply wrong.

25

And I would urge the Court to read Lannoo and

Pechmann and Blihovde, who say, for example,

2

Pechmann, one of the scientists, the upland is

3

currently in commercial pine plantations but -­

4

but could be restored to suitable upland

5

habitat.

6

Blihovde says that aggressive and

7

proactive management of the uplands will be

8

critical to the survival of the frog, the most

9

important management tool being fire to prevent

10

this from being unsuitable habitat.

11

These scientists all have the same

12

point of view, that this land could be restored

13

through extensive effort to upland frog

14

habitat.

15

currently habitat on what this frog -- on which

16

this frog can -- can't survive.

17

Not one of them said that this is

The immediacy here, Justice Kagan,

18

comes from the statutory language.

It comes

19

from the word "habitat" in Section 4.

20

from the limitation in 3(5)(C) that the maximum

21

extent of a critical habitat designation is

22

land that can be occupied.

23

list in 3(3) where you would certainly have

24

anticipated that if Congress thought that land

25

had to be restored or totally remade in order

It comes

It comes from the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

to be habitat for the frog, that it would have

2

said that rather than using the word

3

"maintenance."

4

Maintenance is a word that naturally

5

refers to maintaining what you already have

6

there and improving it, not to completely

7

changing it.

8
9

And, in addition -- in addition to the
powers that I already talked about of the

10

federal agencies having to protect these

11

creatures quite apart from critical habitat

12

designation, there are all sorts of powers

13

operated through the states and the purchase

14

power in Section 5 that allow protection.

15

This is not a choice between the frog

16

surviving and -- and not surviving if it

17

doesn't have this critical habitat.

18

plenty of ways for the government to ensure, as

19

it should, that the frog survives.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

22

MR. BISHOP:

That's what generally

Could I answer that

question, Chief Justice?

23

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

24

MR. BISHOP:

25

Briefly.

I mean, you know, the

government has made absolutely clear what it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

thinks that means, right?

2

admits that it's the most likely outcome here,

3

if we need to apply for permits, is that we get

4

to use 40 percent of the land for development

5

and we have to turn 60 percent of it over for

6

frog habitat.

7

It -- it -- it

We don't think that that is an

8

appropriate use of our land, given that this is

9

not habitat to begin with.
