CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

5

Schein versus Archer and White Sales.

6

Mr. Shanmugam.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The Federal Arbitration Act requires

12

courts to enforce arbitration agreements

13

according to their terms.

14

straightforward application of that principle

15

in the context of arbitrability, specifically

16

where the parties have agreed to delegate to

17

the arbitrator the authority to decide whether

18

claims are subject to arbitration.

This case involves a

19

Where the parties have so agreed, the

20

Arbitration Act requires a court to honor that

21

agreement.

22

decide the issue of arbitrability for itself

23

and to short-circuit the arbitrator's ability

24

to do so.

25

A court does not have the power to

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shanmugam, can

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

we back up and have you explain why we even get

2

to a question, the question presented, because

3

Schein has no arbitration agreement with

4

Archer, so how -- what is this agreement?

5

not between Archer and Schein.

6

get to claim the benefit of an agreement Schein

7

did not make?

8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It's

How does Schein

Justice Ginsburg,

there is a question in the case concerning

10

non-parties.

11

agreements with some of the defendants, not all

12

of them.

13

The agreements in question are

And so, therefore, as to the

14

non-signatory defendants, there is a question

15

reserved by the court of appeals about the

16

doctrine of equitable estoppel, and that would

17

be an issue for the court of appeals to address

18

on remand if this Court agrees with us on the

19

question presented.

20

discrete issue, not reached by the court of

21

appeals in the decision below, and, again, an

22

issue that would be open on remand.

23

That is obviously a

But, on the question presented, I

24

think our submission is quite straightforward.

25

The "wholly groundless" exception on which the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

court of appeals relied has no footing in the

2

text of the Arbitration Act.

3

have agreed to delegate the issue of

4

arbitrability to the arbitrator, the merits of

5

that issue are for the arbitrator and wholly

6

for the arbitrator to decide.

7

Where the parties

Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the

8

Arbitration Act all point in the same

9

direction:

Where you have a valid delegation,

10

that is treated, as this Court has indicated,

11

like an antecedent agreement to arbitrate, and

12

all there is for a court to do is to determine,

13

first, that that provision is itself valid and,

14

second, to determine whether the opposing party

15

is, in fact, resisting the enforcement of that

16

provision.

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

How do we take this -­

18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I'm not sure

19

your answer to Justice Ginsburg is totally

20

responsive.

21

not there is a valid arbitration agreement

22

between the parties is antecedent to an order

23

compelling arbitration.

24

decision.

25

The -- the question of whether or

The court makes that

And I wonder why this isn't a similar

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

question.

2

side makes the argument that, well, parties

3

would not have agreed to submit wholly

4

groundless questions to the arbitrator.

5

you should seek -- treat it as the same type of

6

question.

7

I mean, your friend on the other

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And so

So, Mr. Chief Justice,

8

I think there are two parts to your question.

9

First, to pick up on my response to Justice

10

Ginsburg, we are certainly not disputing that

11

the issue of equitable estoppel, the issue of

12

which parties are bound, is an issue that goes

13

to validity.

14

decide.

It's an issue for the court to

15

So, again, on remand, that would be a

16

question for the court of appeals in the first

17

instance.

18

not reach that question because of its holding

19

on the "wholly groundless" exception.

20

that the -- a requirement that arbitrability

21

goes to the arbitrator was not enforceable as

22

to anyone, even as to the signatories to the

23

agreement.

24
25

The court of appeals explicitly did

It said

I think, as to the second part of your
question, again, we think that the question of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

whether or not there is a valid agreement more

2

generally is a question for the court.

3

if, for instance, there were some question

4

about the validity of the delegation provision,

5

say a question about whether the delegation

6

provision is itself unconscionable, that would

7

again be a question for the court to decide.

8
9

And so,

But I think that, on the issue of
arbitrability, this Court has said time and

10

again, most recently in the First Options case,

11

that arbitrability can be delegated where there

12

is a sufficiently clear delegation, and once

13

the issue is delegated, it is for the

14

arbitrator.

15

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the question -­

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But clear -- clear

17

and unmistakable delegation, why can't it be

18

both; that is, that the arbitrator has this

19

authority to decide questions of arbitrability,

20

but it is not exclusive of the court?

21

We have one brief saying that that is

22

indeed the position that the Restatement has

23

taken.

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So all of the courts

of appeals to have considered the issue have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

held that this type of incorporated delegation

2

meets this Court's requirements, and let me

3

explain why that's true, even though, again,

4

that's an issue outside the scope of the

5

question presented.

6

would be appropriate for this Court to provide

7

guidance on that issue, but the Court certainly

8

does not have to reach it if it so chooses.

9

We certainly think it

What is going on in this case, if you

10

look at the four corners of the delegation -­

11

of the arbitration agreement -- and I would

12

point the Court in particular to page 58 of the

13

Joint Appendix or to page 8 of our brief -- is

14

that the arbitration agreement by its terms

15

incorporates the rules of the American

16

Arbitration Association and it does so very

17

clearly.

18

particularly in commercial arbitrations like

19

the one at issue here.

That is a quite common arrangement,

20

Then, if you take a look at the rules

21

of the American Arbitration Association, those

22

rules, and, in particular, Rule 7(a), clearly

23

give the arbitrator the authority to decide

24

arbitrability.

25

And under this Court's decision in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

First Options, the relevant inquiry is whether

2

or not the parties were willing to be bound by

3

the arbitrator's determination on the issue in

4

question.

5

And so, with all due respect to

6

Professor Bermann and his amicus brief, the

7

position that he propounds has been rejected by

8

every court of appeals to have considered this

9

issue.

And if the Court has any interest in

10

this issue, I would refer the Court to the very

11

thoughtful opinion of the Tenth Circuit in the

12

Belnap case, which discusses this issue in some

13

detail.

14

Again, the Fifth Circuit, in the

15

decision under review, ultimately did not

16

decide that question.

17

question, and I would respectfully submit that

18

its discussion on that issue was somewhat

19

confused.

20

It did discuss that

The Fifth Circuit seemed to think that

21

because there was a substantive carve-out from

22

the scope of arbitration here, that's the very

23

carve-out that's in dispute for actions for

24

injunctive relief, that that -- that somehow

25

had a bearing on the validity of the delegation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

here.

2

But I think with all due respect -­

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But the district

4

court -- the district court made -- decided on

5

alternative grounds, and wasn't the district

6

court's first decision that this contract did

7

not have a sufficiently clear and unmistakable

8

delegation?

9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes, that is correct.

10

And the Fifth Circuit then discussed the issue

11

but ultimately did not rest on it.

12

again, this is a discrete question.

13

outside the scope of the question presented.

And once
It's

14

But I would respectfully submit that I

15

think that the law on this issue is quite clear

16

and that, in particular, to the extent that the

17

district court discussed this issue, Justice

18

Ginsburg, its reliance and Respondent's

19

reliance on the substantive carve-out cannot be

20

correct.

21

In other words, the Respondent's

22

submission below, and really, I think,

23

Respondent's only submission on this issue was

24

that because there is a carve-out from the

25

scope of arbitration, that somehow defeats the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

incorporation of the AAA rules, which provide

2

that arbitrability can be decided by the

3

arbitrator.

4

But that is the very issue that the

5

parties agreed for the arbitrator to decide.

6

And I think it would improperly conflate the

7

question of what is subject to arbitration -­

8
9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I -- could

I -­

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- with the question

11

of who decides to say that that defeats

12

arbitrability here.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You just said the

14

parties agreed to have the arbitrator decide

15

this issue.

16

Assume the Douglas -- facts of the

17

Douglas case.

18

a arbitration agreement over an account and the

19

account was closed within a year, and years

20

later sues the bank for -- for some malfeasance

21

by a lawyer who took money from a different

22

account or something like it.

23

Plaintiff, or Petitioner, signed

I think I'm getting the facts of

24

Douglas.

And the court -- and the arbitrator

25

there improperly assumes jurisdiction.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

There's

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1
2

been a delegation.
What are the -- what are the potential

3

outs for the party who's now been stuck in an

4

arbitration that legally is wholly groundless?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7
8
9

Sure.
The arbitrator

made a mistake.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

So, Justice Sotomayor,

let me address, you know, both that and the

10

related question of what remedies are available

11

to the arbitrator and -- and to the opposing

12

party more generally in the event that a truly

13

frivolous claim of arbitrability is raised.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Exactly.

I think, to address

16

your question directly first, I think in a case

17

where an arbitrator reaches an improper

18

conclusion on arbitrability, the remedies, if

19

any, would be those provided for review of

20

arbitral decisions more generally.

21

And as this Court is well aware, there

22

is a very live dispute in the lower courts

23

about the extent to which courts can review the

24

merits of arbitrators' decisions and whether

25

they can be reviewed for manifest disregard.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

That is an issue that this Court has left open.

2

But I think that that would

3

potentially be available.

And lower courts

4

have said that that is available where an

5

arbitrator reaches a wildly incorrect decision

6

on arbitrability.

7

I think that, to the extent that the

8

other side points to the Douglas case as sort

9

of the flagship example of a meritless claim of

10

arbitrability being raised and the dangers of

11

getting -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Basically, you're

13

telling me at least on the express terms of

14

enforcing an arbitration award under the

15

statute, there is no remedy for that Douglas

16

party?

17
18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, there is

potentially review -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

21
22
23

If -- if -­

-- for manifest

disregard.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

If we -- if we

accept manifest disregard.

24

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We haven't done

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

that yet.

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

Which is to say -­
But there's no

statutory provision under the Act?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Which is to say that

6

it's no different from review where an

7

arbitrator reaches a wildly incorrect

8

conclusion on the merits of an arbitral award.

9

In other words, arbitrability is in

10

the same bucket as any other issue that is

11

properly remitted to the arbitrator.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

Do you think that

--

14
15

Review -­

MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- if any, would be

under Section 10 of the Arbitration Act.

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Do you think that

17

it could be the arbitrator exceeding their

18

powers?

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, it could be.

20

And I think that if you look at the lower

21

courts that have reviewed arbitrability

22

determinations, some of them have located

23

review in exceeds powers in Section 10(a)(4),

24

though even those courts have engaged in pretty

25

deferential review.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

I think, as a practical matter, it's

2

basically the same review as manifest disregard

3

review, and it certainly is not the sort of de

4

novo review that Respondent seems to

5

contemplate.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can -- can you

7

understand the common sense resistance to the

8

idea that, if a party has not agreed to

9

arbitrate a particular issue because it's

10

wholly groundless, there is no way that an

11

arbitrator could in good faith and without

12

error reach a conclusion that arbitration was

13

agreed to?

14

believe that we're sending a party to

15

arbitration, to potentially go through the

16

expense of arbitration when something's wholly

17

groundless, and then potentially not to have an

18

avenue of relief when it comes to enforcing the

19

arbitration award.

It seems counterintuitive to

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Sotomayor -­

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's why -- I'm

22

sorry -- that's why I think one of the amici

23

said the courts are not understanding that, at

24

the core, this is always about have you agreed

25

to arbitrate an issue?

And, if you haven't,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1
2

you shouldn't be forced to.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Sotomayor, I'm

3

sorry to have interrupted, but two points in

4

response to that.

5

First, I think it's important to the

6

extent that we're talking about the parties'

7

intent to recognize that the parties intended

8

for the arbitrator to decide arbitrability.

9

There was no carve-out, explicit or

10

implicit, for wholly groundless claims, which

11

is to say that where, as here, you have a

12

dispute of this variety, you have one party

13

saying that the claim of arbitrability is

14

wholly groundless.

15

saying not only is it not wholly groundless, we

16

believe we have a valid argument about the

17

construction of the carve-out.

18

You have the other party

The parties agreed to have the

19

arbitrator be the decision-maker.

And I don't

20

think, with all due respect to Respondent, who

21

faints in this direction, that there's any way

22

to reform the incorporated delegation here to

23

create a carve-out, to create a carve-out for

24

wholly groundless claims to say that the

25

parties somehow implicitly agreed that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

arbitrator would decide arbitrability unless

2

the claim was somehow wholly groundless or that

3

there would be some preliminary determination

4

by the district court.

5

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But why is that -­

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Now I do -­

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- Mr. Shanmugam?

I

8

mean, if you look at First Options, First

9

Options is a case where we said we're not going

10

to treat these delegation clauses in exactly

11

the same way as we treat other clauses.

12

And there was an idea that people

13

don't really think about the question of who

14

decides, and so we're going to hold parties to

15

this higher standard, the clear and

16

unmistakable intent standard.

17

And wouldn't the same kind of argument

18

be true here, that the parties never really

19

considered who was going to decide these

20

groundless claims of arbitrability, or maybe,

21

if they did consider it, they would have

22

thought that it was a pretty strange system to

23

send it to an arbitrator just so that the

24

arbitrator could send it back to the court?

25

So that we are going to -- to -- you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

know, to -- to say that there's a special rule

2

in interpreting these kinds of clauses.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Kagan, I -- I

4

-- there is obviously an interpretive rule that

5

requires clear and unmistakable evidence that

6

the parties intended to delegate the issue.

7

But I would respectfully submit that, once you

8

have that evidence, that rule falls out of the

9

equation.

10

And again, with -­

11

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why -- why do you

12

have the evidence?

13

model case is this Court's Rent-a-Car decision,

14

and there the -- the clause said the

15

arbitrator, not the court, has exclusive

16

authority.

17

When the -- the -- the

And, here, we -- we're missing both

18

the arbitrator, to the exclusion of the court,

19

and the arbitrator has exclusive authority.

20

It's nothing like that.

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think, Justice

22

Ginsburg, if you take a look at page 946 of

23

this Court's opinion in First Options, it

24

focuses on the willingness of the party to be

25

bound by the arbitrator's decision.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

And I think, with all due respect, we

2

have that here.

3

what you cannot do, I would respectfully

4

submit, is to say that the parties implicitly

5

countenanced a regime where the district court

6

would make a preliminary determination.

7

And I think that what you -­

With respect, Justice Kagan, I think

8

your question assumes that the claim of

9

arbitrability is wholly groundless.

That is

10

the very merits dispute between the parties.

11

We believe that we have -- that the

12

claims at issue are arbitrable, and Respondent

13

disagrees with that.

14

this is a merits issue for the arbitrator to

15

decide where the parties -­

16

And, once that is true,

JUSTICE BREYER:

What's wholly

17

groundless?

18

is he saying what's wholly groundless is the

19

claim that arbitrability is to be decided by

20

the arbitrator?

21
22

What's wholly groundless?

MR. SHANMUGAM:

It's the claim

that these substantive claims are subject to -­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24

MR. SHANMUGAM:

25

No.

Is -­

Substantive.
-- arbitration.

And

that is an issue on which the magistrate judge

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

disagreed.

The magistrate judge concluded that

2

we had a plausible construction of this

3

agreement -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- but notwithstanding

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- so you say step 1.

6

Okay.

So -­

--

7
8

Is there clear and unmistakable evidence that

9

an arbitrator is to decide whether a particular

10

matter X is arbitrable?

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that right?
Yes.

The -­

And step 2, the

13

answer to the first question is yes, they did

14

decide that clearly and unmistakably.

15

we see if, why not send it to them, or it's

16

totally groundless, we still won't send it to

17

them.

That's this case, right?

18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.
And I would like to

say a little bit about why we think that -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

question about it.

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

Sure.
You say when you get

4

to step 2, once we're there, now there is no

5

wholly groundless exception, go send it to the

6

arbitrator.

Is that right?

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

it's really weird.

That is correct.
Okay.

Now suppose

I mean, you want to say no

10

exception at all?

He says, my claim here is a

11

Martian told me to do it.

12

(Laughter.)

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay?

Are you saying no

14

matter what, even if he has to read the word

15

yes in the contract to mean no, never, under no

16

circumstances, is there no exception no matter

17

what?

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:
Justice -­

20
21

Yes, and picking up on

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes?

Yes, no

exception no matter what?

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

There is no exception

23

no matter what, but there are remedies

24

available where a party makes a truly frivolous

25

claim.

JUSTICE BREYER:

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

What?
First, it is agreed

3

that the arbitrator has the ability to impose a

4

wide range of sanctions on a party that is

5

making a frivolous argument.

6

are comparable to the sanctions that a court

7

can impose in litigation.

8
9

And it may also be true that a court

the way, loves Martians.

12
13
14

Those sanctions

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The arbitrator, by

Well, what we contend

-JUSTICE BREYER:

So -- so what they're

15

worried about is they're going to get a bad

16

decision on this ridiculous claim.

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But going back to the

18

very early days or the relatively early days of

19

this Court's -­

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yeah.
-- FAA jurisprudence,

22

this Court made clear in Shearson Lehman that

23

we presume that arbitrators are fair, impartial

24

decision-makers.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, they may not -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Shanmugam -­

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

They may or may not

3

love Martians, but do you think it's fair to

4

say that they love arbitration, so they're not

5

probably very much inclined to sanction parties

6

who bring suit -- bring arbitrable disputes to

7

them?

8
9

MR. SHANMUGAM:

They actually do have

specific and explicit remedies under their

10

rules for providing -- for imposing sanctions,

11

including cost and fee shifting and the like.

12

And it may very well be that after an

13

arbitrator makes his or her determination that

14

a district court would have the ability to

15

impose sanctions under Rule 11 where the

16

requirements of that rule have been met.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, how can it do

18

that?

19

the arbitrability question itself, how does the

20

court all of a sudden have the power to

21

sanction a motion to compel?

22

If the court can't even take a peek at

MR. SHANMUGAM:

At least before

23

remitting the issue to arbitration, I think

24

there would be a conflict between Rule 11 and

25

the Arbitration Act if a court were to make a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

merits determination first.

2

an arbitrator makes a determination, when the

3

parties are back before the district court, I

4

think the district court would have the ability

5

to make the determination that the petition to

6

compel arbitration was frivolous or brought in

7

bad faith.

JUSTICE BREYER:

But I think, after

Now what is the

advantage -- what is the advantage of this?

10

Because remember step 1.

12

decide whether there is a clear and

13

unmistakable commitment to have this kind of

14

matter decided in arbitration.

15

matter.

16

Step 1 is we have to

Now, kind of

Now you would have thought if you

17

really have a Martian case, the judge would

18

have found some way not to send it, and he

19

would have said kind of matter.

20

Martian kind of matter.

21

Well, not the

There's no clear and unmistakable

22

commitment to send that kind of matter.

23

other words, if it's weird enough, you don't

24

have to get beyond step 1 because you can say

25

there's no commitment to send this kind of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

In

Official - Subject to Final Review

matter.

2

that and what they did say, there's no

3

commitment to send a groundless matter?

4

And now what's the difference between

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But the whole point of

5

the principle that the parties can delegate

6

arbitrability to the arbitrator -­

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. SHANMUGAM:

9
10

13
14

-- is that the parties

can make a decision about who decides and
where -­

11
12

Yes.

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I understand

that.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- the parties' intent

is sufficiently clear that the arbitrator -­

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes.

16

MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- decides, it's -­

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it's never

18

sufficiently clear if the matter that they're

19

deciding to arbitrate is a Martian matter,

20

unless they really said Martians, which I don't

21

think would ever happen.

22

In other words, if it is a totally

23

ridiculous claim, shouldn't you have to find a

24

clear and definite commitment to send a wholly

25

ridiculous matter to the arbitrator?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That goes to the

2

merits, and wherever you set the bar, the fact

3

remains that it is still a merits

4

determination.

5

And to the extent that this Court is

6

concerned about this as a policy matter -- and

7

I would respectfully submit that there is not a

8

lot of evidence to indicate that this is a

9

problem, perhaps not surprisingly, because

10

often the defendants bear the cost of arbitral

11

proceedings -- the regime that we are

12

advocating is not only more faithful to the

13

language of the Arbitration Act -­

14
15

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:
about -­

16
17

Well, what

MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- it is a much more

efficient regime.

18

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- what about

19

Section 4 of the Act, which Respondent points

20

to as the front-end equivalent of what you

21

alluded to in response to Justice Sotomayor as

22

the back-end Section 10 review?

23
24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

As this Court made

clear -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The "failure to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

comply therewith" language in particular which

2

they focus on, what does that mean and what

3

does that do?

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Sure.

As this Court

5

made clear in Prima Paint, that language limits

6

a court's role in ruling on a petition to

7

compel arbitration to reviewing the making and

8

the performance of the agreement.

9

the relevant agreement is the agreement to

10
11

And, here,

remit arbitrability to the arbitrator.
And there is a failure to comply when

12

the opposing party, the party that does not

13

want arbitration, is resisting arbitration.

14

That is all that is required.

15

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So what work -­

16

what work does that language do?

17

MR. SHANMUGAM:

18

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

All that it -­
On performance.

-- requires -­
I -- what -- give

21

me an example of when that would have some

22

effect, if there is one.

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I -- I think

24

that all it requires a court to do -- and this

25

is a pretty minimal function -- is to determine

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

that you have one party that wants arbitration

2

and another party that does not.

3

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So that -- that's

4

what I thought you'd say.

5

essence, I think, that that language in the

6

statute does no work.

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

And that means, in

Well, there has to

8

still be a -- a -- a dispute, which is to say

9

you've got to have one party -­

10
11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

That's covered by

the beginning of the Section 4, though.

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, I -- I don't

13

think so.

14

relevant -- the relevant failure to comply.

15

I mean, I think that that is the

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

A party aggrieved

16

by the alleged failure or refusal to arbitrate.

17

I'm -- I'm just trying to figure out what

18

"failure to comply therewith" -­

19

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think both sides

20

agree that those two things are essentially

21

reenforcing, which is to say that when you have

22

a party that resists arbitration, the moving

23

party is aggrieved.

24

Respondent recognizes in a footnote in its

25

brief that "aggrieved" does no independent work

And I think that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1
2

beyond that.
But I do think that the regime that

3

we're advocating is a more efficient regime

4

precisely because, under Respondent's regime, a

5

district court is supposedly making this

6

threshold determination on whether or not the

7

claim of arbitrability is wholly groundless.

8

If a district court concludes that the

9

claim is not wholly groundless, presumably, the

10

issue would then go to the arbitrator to make a

11

plenary determination on that issue, and if the

12

district court determines that the claim is

13

wholly groundless, there will be appeals as of

14

right immediately under Section 16 of the

15

Arbitration Act.

16

And that will lead to the very

17

inefficiency that we see in this case.

18

case is certainly an outlier because it has

19

taken so long, but we are now six years down

20

the road, still litigating the issue of

21

arbitrability.

22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

This

But that was -­

23

that was the court's -- left for the court to

24

decide whether the motion was for the

25

magistrate judge to reconsider or for the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

district court to review.

2

MR. SHANMUGAM:

That explains three of

3

the six years of the delay, Justice Ginsburg.

4

But I really don't think it can be reasonably

5

disputed that if the issue of arbitrability had

6

gone to the arbitrator in the first instance,

7

as it should have, that we probably would be

8

entirely done with this case.

9

And, of course, our fundamental

10

submission is that there is simply no footing

11

in the text of the Arbitration Act for this

12

exception.

13

questions about the delegation in this case,

14

that is a discrete question that the Court need

15

not reach here.

16

To the extent that the Court has

And so we submit that on the question

17

presented, the answer is quite simple:

18

does not permit this exception and, therefore,

19

the judgment should be vacated.

20
21

I'll reserve the balance of my time
for rebuttal.

Under Section 4 of the -­

MR. GEYSER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So explain it to

that language is limited to was there an

15

agreement between the parties and was there a

delegation, and if there is, don't look to the

17

merits.

18

MR. GEYSER:

I -- I -­

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I don't see how

20

determining whether something is wholly

21

groundless is anything but a merits

22

determination.

23

MR. GEYSER:

Well, Your Honor, it's -­

24

it's what type of merits determination.

25

Section 4's plain text authorizes the courts

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

and, in fact, instructs them to have a

2

gatekeeping function in looking at the merits

3

of whether there's a failure to comply with the

4

arbitration agreement.

5

It says nothing at all about the

6

failure to file a legitimate claim on the

7

merits.

form of the merits.
MR. GEYSER:

Well, I don't think

23

Rent-A-Center, though, is saying that if

24

there's only one possible outcome, then you

25

should send it to the arbitrator anyway.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And,

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

in fact, that would be inconsistent with what

2

this Court did in Stolt-Nielsen.

3

Stolt-Nielsen, the parties expressly agreed

4

that the arbitrator would decide if there's

5

class arbitration.

6

In

And the court said the arbitrator

7

applied the wrong analysis.

And it did not

8

send the case back to the arbitrator to do

9

again.

It said there is only one possible

10

outcome and so proceeded to decide the issue on

11

its own.

12

And that's consistent with general

13

legal principles.

If there is an absolutely

14

futile claim that makes absolutely no sense,

15

there is no conceivable possibility that the

16

arbitrator will say that this case belongs in

17

arbitration, there's not a bona fide dispute,

18

there's no point to sending it to the

19

arbitrator.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

JUSTICE ALITO:

But doesn't that

depend on the -- the -- the nature of the -­

the agreement as to arbitrability?

7

the parties agree to have the arbitrator

decide?

9

What did

Suppose you have an agreement that

10

says the arbitrator has exclusive authority to

decide all questions of arbitrability,

12

regardless of whether the claim of

arbitrability has any merit whatsoever.

would you say then?

be a highly unusual agreement.

I -- I think that would

JUSTICE ALITO:

you say?
MR. GEYSER:

20

that, then I think you would have a failure to

21

comply with that agreement.

22

don't see that is because no one agrees to be

23

subjected to a needless and needlessly

24

expensive gateway arbitration.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

But the reason we

But that's a question

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

of -- that's not the question that's before us.

2

That's the question of the interpretation of

3

the -- of this contract and the scope of what

4

was delegated to the arbitrator.

5

MR. GEYSER:

Well, but the -- the

6

scope of what was delegated, the question here

7

is did the parties actually agree at the

8

outset, is there a clear and unmistakable

9

showing that they intended to have an

10

arbitrator decide a wholly groundless claim

11

that has only one possible outcome?

12

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I thought the

13

question we agreed to take was whether there's

14

a wholly groundless exception when the parties

15

have agreed that arbitrability will be decided

16

by the arbitrator.

17

MR. GEYSER:

Well, but I think there

18

are two different things here, Justice Alito.

19

One is, is there a general delegation clause,

20

which, again, wasn't even found in this case.

21

It comes to the court assuming that there is

22

one.

23

And then the second is, if there is a

24

general delegation clause, such as here it is

25

incorporating the AAA rules, which, as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

Professor Berman pointed out, is a pretty

2

tenuous hook to, again, satisfy a clear and

3

unmistakable standard, did the parties when

4

they said nothing else about it really intend

5

to be subjected to frivolous arbitration

6

claims?

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Mr. Geyser, the

8

problem is that you're taking the position here

9

that this was wholly groundless to consider a

10

mixed injunctive relief and damages claim as

11

being covered by this arbitration award.

12

The other side makes a very compelling

13

argument that, no, there's actually a ground to

14

-- to say that injunctive relief goes to the

15

court, but damages go to arbitrators.

16

And when we have mixed claims, most

17

courts will either send the matter to

18

arbitration and stay the injunctive relief

19

until the arbitration's over.

20

determine that both can go simultaneously, they

21

do it.

22

If they

But there are plenty of cases with

23

mixed questions that courts handle all the

24

time.

25

to draw that line.

My difficulty is that I don't know where
I don't know where what's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

wholly frivolous to you may not be to someone

2

else.

3

why shouldn't that go to the arbitrator?

And if there's been a true delegation,

4

Don't go to the facts of this case.

5

Let's assume a clear delegation.

6

know you're making arguments about the ABA, but

7

we didn't grant cert on that.

8

MR. GEYSER:

9

clear delegation.

I agree.

Because I

Let's assume a

But let's also assume a

10

completely frivolous, baseless, maybe even

11

abusive claim because -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

Are you

13

claiming -- because you're arguing that this

14

case is wholly groundless, because that's the

15

ground that arbitration was not ordered by the

16

court below.

17

This is the quintessential case where

18

most of these cases are on the margin.

And

19

I've actually gone and had the library do

20

research.

21

cases is very small.

22

MR. GEYSER:

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The number of wholly groundless

It -- it -- it is.
So, you know,

24

mistakes are made even by judges.

So the fact

25

that the four or five arbitrators who make a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

mistake, I don't know if that's statistically

2

different than judges making mistakes.

3

MR. GEYSER:

Your Honor, the wholly

4

groundless doctrine is a very modest inquiry.

5

All you need to do to satisfy it, in respect to

6

my friend, it is not asking the court to decide

7

the arbitrability determination.

8

them to decide is there a dispute over

9

arbitrability, a bona fide dispute?

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's asking

Is it -­

But the court has

11

to decide wholly groundless.

So where do you

12

draw the line between merely incorrect,

13

groundless, and wholly groundless?

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

MR. GEYSER:

Good question.

I think the -- where the

16

line is drawn is where the courts of appeals

17

have drawn it.

weak, then it goes to the arbitrator because

I would say if there's

not a bona fide dispute, then it goes to the

arbitrator.

17

though courts have used different

articulations, that's where each standard

points to.

20

I think that effectively, even

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

even that mean?

Clearly, there's a bona fide

dispute when two parties are litigating all the

MR. GEYSER:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right?

And so I

2

know it's a small exception today, but the

3

experience of this Court has been when it

4

creates small exceptions, they tend to become

5

larger ones with time.

6

And -- and the whole point of

7

arbitration, of course, is to try and

8

streamline things.

9

litigation all the way up and down the federal

10

system over wholly groundless, only to wind up

11

in arbitration, ultimately seems highly

12

inefficient.

13

And -- and having

Isn't your real complaint here the

first one, Justice Breyer's, in that there's

15

just maybe a really good argument that clear

and unmistakable proof doesn't exist in this

have the arbitrator decide arbitrability?

for it because there's not a clear and

MR. GEYSER:

I didn't think so.

Now -­

21

and just to show how little of a problem this

22

causes in practice, this doctrine has existed

23

for decades in multiple circuits, and it's

rarely invoked because courts can understand

the difference between something that is like a

that's a legitimate argument.

other courts in other circuits, I'll bet, but

we have other courts who have read it exactly

the way they read it.

wholly frivolous when you have so many people

split on an issue.

construction of the actual language of the

3

agreement was problematic.

4

of the petition appendix.

5

That's at page 41a
It said problematic.

It rewrote the agreement to -- to -­

6

to match what the magistrate judge thought

7

would be a better arbitration clause.

That's exactly what this Court has
said that arbitrators can't do, and I don't see

any license for a magistrate judge to be able

to do it either.

13

You have to apply the

And for the other circuits that have

14

looked at other clauses and said we can divide

15

it up between injunctive relief and cases on

16

the merits, those involved very different

17

arbitration clauses.

18

clauses were written in very different terms.

19

The language of those

They typically divided up one general

20

delegation where everything goes to the

21

arbitrator and then in a separate section or

22

separate sentence at least, it carved out

23

specific claims that sought injunctive relief.

24
25

Here, you have a parenthetical that
says that if it's an action, not a claim, but

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

an action seeking injunctive relief, it's -­

2

it's excluded.

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

4

injunctive relief does Archer seek?

5

that what Archer wants most of all is money

6

damages.

7

MR. GEYSER:

Well, what -- what
We're told

Well, and -- and the

8

courts could have, or the parties could have -­

9

and at least the ones that had the arbitration

10

clause -- could have written this to say that

11

the predominant relief is damages.

12

13

That's not what they wrote.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

injunctive relief?

15

to the ground.

16

It goes to

But what kind of

Just let's take this down

MR. GEYSER:

Sure.

They're seeking an

17

injunction of anticompetitive conduct that has

18

been investigated now by multiple state and

19

federal agencies and that we allege is ongoing

20

today.

21

So what they'd like to have happen is

22

the -- the anticompetitive conduct to stop.

23

Now, if that goes to the arbitrator, that will

24

multiply proceedings because an arbitrator

25

can't enforce their own award.

They don't have

2

arbitrator saying we'll grant an injunction and

3

get that enforced in court, where surely there

4

will be more litigation in court.

5

You need to get an award from the

So it makes perfectly good sense that

6

parties thinking in advance that they might

7

need injunctive relief would not want to

8

include to -- to arbitration an action seeking

9

injunctive relief.

10
11
12

But to -- to bring this back to the
actual text of the statute, I -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

On the text of the

13

statute, you hang almost everything on the

14

"failure to comply therewith" language.

15

you heard Mr. Shanmugam's response to that,

16

that that's very much a minimal bar that is

17

merely designed to ensure that someone's

18

opposing the referral or opposing arbitration.

19

What's your response to him?

And

20

MR. GEYSER:

I -- respectfully, I -- I

21

think he's mistaken.

22

plain language of the statute, which is

23

imposing a direct gatekeeping function on the

24

court, say they have to be satisfied, there's

25

been a failure to comply with the arbitration

agreement.

2

perspective, does anyone think that you fail to

3

comply with an arbitration agreement when the

4

only conceivable outcome is a case belongs in

5

court?

6

So, from a common sense

It's effectively like saying a party

7

has to go to the arbitrator and seek

8

preclearance before they can file their claim,

9

even if it's the Martian example, where there's

10

no conceivable chance that the arbitrator, if

11

they're genuinely construing the agreement,

12

will say this belongs in arbitration.

13

And that respectfully just makes no

14

sense.

15

the statutory design.

16

Section 10 -- and we do think Section 10

17

provides a back-end safeguard here, that if an

18

arbitrator takes the Martian case and they

19

absolutely exceed their powers, they've

20

adjudicated a dispute that the parties did not

21

grant authority for the arbitrator to resolve,

22

that would be an excess of authority.

23

It especially makes no sense looking at
Congress under

It makes no sense when Congress has

24

that specific substantive check on the back

25

end, they've authorized the same judges to read

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49

the same agreement and make the same "wholly

2

groundless" type determination, that they say

3

let's just do it on the back end and not on the

4

front end before we can save this huge and

5

colossal waste of time and resources.

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is -- just follow me

7

here -- is -- Professor Bermann, I thought, was

8

writing an amicus brief on your side which says

9

there isn't a clear and unmistakable commitment

But is that issue in front of

MR. GEYSER:

we would warmly -­

It's pretty

And that's an argument.

MR. GEYSER:

We -- we would warmly

invite a DIG if the Court would like to -- to
DIG the case.

11

(Laughter.)

12

JUSTICE BREYER:

13

MR. GEYSER:

Yeah.

But, at the same time,

14

though, we -- we do think there is, in fact, a

15

"wholly groundless" doctrine just as there has

16

been one for decades in the lower courts

17

without any meaningful frustration of

18

legitimate rights to arbitrate.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Geyser, can I go

20

back to Justice Kavanaugh's textual question,

21

because, when I stare at this language, "the

22

failure to comply therewith" language, it seems

23

to me I can read it two ways, neither of which

24

is yours.

25

So the first way is Mr. Shanmugam's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

minimalist way.

2

anything at all.

3

It doesn't mean very much of

The second way suggests that we've

4

gone wrong in -- in prior cases.

5

maximalist approach, which is what this

6

language was meant to do was assign

7

arbitrability issues to the courts, but we've

8

-- we've pretty much -- we've -- we've gone by

9

that -- that understanding of the language.

10

It's the

What I can't understand is how you can

11

read the language to create this halfway house

12

position.

13

MR. GEYSER:

Sure.

And -- and,

14

Justice Kagan, first of all, I do think that,

15

actually, the most faithful interpretation of

16

this text is that it does assign to the courts

17

the responsibility to decide the gateway issue.

18

But that -- that ship has somewhat sailed.

19

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

20

MR. GEYSER:

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23
24
25

You can't do that?

But -- but -- I'm sorry?
Keep going.

The ship has sailed.

We're agreeing that the ship has sailed.
MR. GEYSER:

The ship has sailed.

I do think, though, just if you read the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

language sensibly, both looking at -- at the

2

actual text and looking at Section 10,

3

understanding that there will be this review on

4

the back end, it only makes sense to say that

5

there's not a failure to comply with an

6

arbitration agreement if what the parties

7

agreed is that if there's a legitimate dispute,

8

there's a bona fide dispute, it goes to the

9

arbitrator.

If there's not a bona fide

10

dispute, then there's no failure to comply by

11

filing it in court.

12

And I do think that you can't read

13

that into the language of -- of an ordinary

14

agreement.

15

and all the cases that came up in this, I

16

didn't see a single example where people said:

17

We'll have a delegation provision but no

18

frivolous claims or no sham allegations.

19

one writes that into an agreement because it's

20

presumed.

21

We -- looking at all the contracts

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

No

But you -- you

22

seem to agree with Justice Kagan, I think, that

23

the statute doesn't, most naturally read,

24

create a "wholly groundless" exception with

25

that language.

It may have suggested the court

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

should decide questions of arbitrability.

So

2

we've -- the Court's rejected that.

3

create -- I guess I'm repeating Justice Kagan's

4

question, but why create this new thing out of

5

language that was not designed to do that?

So why

6

MR. GEYSER:

7

I don't think it's new at all.

8

that the -- it's -- it's very hard to say -­

9

Well, Justice Kavanaugh,

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

I -- I think

It's new in the

10

statute, is what I'm saying, in the sense that

11

you had an all-or-nothing question, I think,

12

with the statutory language, as Justice Kagan

13

said, and the court decided that.

14

MR. GEYSER:

Well, I think -- I think

15

there are two ways to look at it, and one is a

16

statutory hook, which I still do think is the

17

best way to read this language.

18

to understand how something is a failure to

19

comply with an arbitration agreement if the

20

arbitration agreement is saying if there's a

21

bona fide dispute over arbitrability, then it

22

goes to the arbitrator.

23

fide dispute over arbitrability, then you don't

24

fail to comply by filing it in court.

25

It's very hard

If there's not a bona

So it is, in fact, I think the "wholly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

groundless" doctrine that it's -- it's tapping

2

on an intuition that's already there.

3

just giving this language some sort of reading

4

that makes sense and that's consistent with the

5

parties' intent.

6

It's

And that -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But that goes, again,

7

to the interpretation of the delegation of

8

arbitrability.

9

you're saying that implicit in any provision of

10

the contract that says arbitrability is for the

11

arbitrator, there's the exception for -- for

12

this type of dispute.

As I understand your argument,

13

MR. GEYSER:

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

There -- there is -­
That's the argument,

right?
MR. GEYSER:

That -- that is -- that

17

anticipates being dragged into an absolutely

frivolous dispute.

to that for wholly groundless disputes?

5

MR. GEYSER:

What if it's a

Is there an exception

No, I think a forum

selection clause would be slightly different

7

because someone has to adjudicate the -- the

8

underlying merits, whether it's this judge or a

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Sorry, but is this

a sensible system where, even though we only

have five cases over a long period of time in

frivolous grounds, we're now inviting this

10

fight in every motion to compel arbitration -­

11

MR. GEYSER:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

will multiply expenses?

Maybe not in your

14

individual case but as a burden on courts.

15

MR. GEYSER:

No -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So it's not clear

17

to me that your solution is more efficient in a

18

meaningful way.

19

MR. GEYSER:

I think our -- our

20

solution is far more efficient, Your Honor, and

21

if -- if I could explain why.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. GEYSER:

24

then I -- I think -­

25

Only if you win.

Well -- well, if we win,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. GEYSER:

Well, no, I think

3

plaintiffs have -- have an incentive to have

4

their cases adjudicated.

5

that are trying to invite protracted side

6

litigation over issues.

7

plaintiffs who actually think the arbitration

8

demand is wholly groundless that will spend the

9

resources to resist on that level.

10

They're not the ones

It's only the

And I also think it's far more

11

efficient for the court to decide this than the

12

arbitrator.

13

the arbitration clause.

14

Whatever Section 4 means, we can all agree that

15

it does impose a gatekeeping function; the

16

court -- the courts do have to look at

17

something.

18

already.

19

The court already has to look at
It has to do that.

So they're looking at the dispute

All they need to do to resolve the

20

"wholly groundless" inquiry is say, is there a

21

dispute?

22

They're not resolving arbitrability.

23

is there any legitimate argument here that any

24

reasoned decision-maker could credit?

25

identify that argument, they send it to the

They don't need to decide it.
They say,

If they

2

That is far more efficient than asking

3

the parties to initiate a needless and

needlessly expensive gateway arbitration when

5

everyone knows the only two possible outcomes

6

is they send it right back so you can start

over in court months later, you know, possibly

8

tens of thousands of dollars in the hole, or

9

mistake and keeps it.

11

So I -- I don't think that is an

system, are you saying essentially that the -­

20

that the basis for this rule is that we don't

believe that a delegation clause includes this,

22

that we don't believe that the parties intended

23

for a general delegation clause to include

24

these kinds of groundless questions?

basically the idea?

Is that

11

interpretive rule that we're going to interpret

12

these contracts in a certain way.

13

And that seems like a strange thing

14

for us to think about the FAA.

15

MR. GEYSER:

Oh, I -- I don't think

16

that's strange at all, Your Honor.

17

First Options and -- and in -- in Oxford, or in

18

Stolt-Nielsen, the Court specifically says that

19

it crafts interpretive rules in the setting to

20

match the parties' likely intent.

21

In -- in

So, if the court thinks that when

22

parties are silent about what do you do with a

23

wholly groundless, frivolous dispute, and,

24

again, the doctrine, this is an all-or-nothing

25

challenge to it, so the Court has to think what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

about the truly frivolous arbitration demand.

2

And I -- I think it's perfectly

3

sensible to say that parties did not agree to

4

have non-bona fide disputes sent to an

5

arbitrator.

6

unreasonable proposition.

7

I -- I don't think that's an

Again, I have not seen a single

8

contract that says we reserve wholly frivolous,

9

abusive arbitration demands.

10

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but you

11

phrase it that way.

But you could phrase it

12

differently.

13

historically not done well in court and

14

whatever -- whatever comes up, they say I don't

15

want a court to do it, I want an arbitrator to

16

do it.

What if there's a party that has

17

What's wrong with that?

18

MR. GEYSER:

I -- I think if the party

19

is clear and unmistakable in saying that, even

20

if the dispute has absolutely no conceivable

21

merit, and everyone knows it's going to be back

22

in court whether the parties like it or not,

23

then, if they make that sufficiently clear,

24

then debatably -­

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

A work -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

2

MR. GEYSER:

-- there's a failure

under Section 4.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

But there's a work

4

contract lawyer, labor, one of them says I'll

5

tell you what I want arbitrated.

6

Crimea?

7

do?

8

So what's the judge supposed to do?

Okay?

What's the judge supposed to

The contract has nothing to do with this.

9
10

Who owns

MR. GEYSER:

The -- well, I -- I think

if it -- so if it's a wholly groundless -­

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

It has nothing to do

12

with this contract.

13

arbitrated, nothing to do with it.

14

MR. GEYSER:

He wants something

Again, I think the answer

15

if the Court looks at it and says there's

16

nothing for the arbitrator to do, then there's

17

not a failure to comply by not filing an

18

arbitration demand.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

Okay.

21

business.

22

same question.

23

No failure to comply.

So that's the basis of this groundless
Okay.

So he has the -- I have the
Okay.

MR. GEYSER:

So I think -- and that's

24

also consistent just with general litigation

25

norms.

My friend suggests effectively that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

FAA carves an exception to Rule 11 principles.

2

And I don't see that anywhere in the text of

3

the FAA.

4

On the contrary, this Court construes

5

the FAA as creating sort of an equal treatment

6

rule.

7

just the same as any other agreement.

8

normally, when a party files a frivolous and

9

abusive claim in court, they're sanctioned.

10

All arbitration agreements are treated
And

They don't -- they don't win.

11

And I don't think it makes any sense

12

to say that someone can file a frivolous claim,

13

then you can -- you -- you reward the claim,

14

you send it to the arbitrator, and then, after

15

the arbitrator gets done saying, yeah, that was

16

frivolous, then you sanction them under Rule

17

11.

18

That's -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

If you -- if we -­

19

if we don't accept your argument, can you tell

20

us, there are many, many open questions in this

21

case, right?

22
23
24
25

MR. GEYSER:

There are many open

questions in this case.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So -- that the

Fifth Circuit didn't decide?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

MR. GEYSER:

That's correct.

The -­

2

the -- it comes to the Court where the Fifth

3

Circuit almost decided.

4

Petitioners' argument that there is a

5

delegation clause was wrong but then didn't

6

actually enter a holding on that, which, again,

7

is why we think that, in a way, this is an

8

academic decision in this particular case.

9

It explained why

Again, it's outside the question

10

presented, so we didn't -- we didn't brief the

11

substance of that.

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

13

because our answer has a consequence.

14

agree with him that there is no statutory

15

provision for wholly groundless exceptions,

16

then all the other questions have to go back

17

and be actually answered.

18

MR. GEYSER:

It's not academic

Yes -- yes.

If we

No, I'm -­

19

I'm not suggesting that there's not

20

jurisdiction to resolve the question.

21

saying that in this case it -- it is highly

22

unlikely to have any effect on the ultimate

23

outcome.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm just

Well, that's only

because you intend to win all the other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
64
1

questions.

2

(Laughter.)

3

MR. GEYSER:

4

certainly our intent, Your Honor.

5
6
7

Well, we -- that's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I can't tell you

MR. GEYSER:

But -- but, again,

that.
Yeah.

8

though, the -- the way it comes to the Court is

9

it's saying, even for the most frivolous and

10

abusive arbitration demand imaginable, if there

11

is a delegation clause, are the courts actually

12

powerless where they have -- their only option

13

is to send it to the arbitrator, where they

14

already know the answer.

15

And that's inconsistent with what this

16

Court did in Stolt-Nielsen.

17

specifically looked -- and this is at page 676

18

and 677 of the court's opinion -- and said if

19

there is only one possible outcome, even where

20

the parties, as they did in that case,

21

expressly agreed that this is a determination

22

for the arbitrator, then you do not send it

23

back to the arbitrator because it's pointless.

24

You decide it yourself.

25

Stolt-Nielsen

And that's exactly what the wholly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
65
1

groundless doctrine is doing, and it's doing it

2

sensibly on the front end when you look at an

3

arbitration demand and you can either say the

4

parties didn't clearly and unmistakably intend,

5

when you have a frivolous dispute that has

6

nothing at all to do with the contract, to send

7

it to the arbitrator, it's enforcing the

8

parties' intent, and I think it's consistent

9

with Section 4.

10

If the Court has no further questions.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

12

Thank you,

14

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K.

15

SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

16
17
18

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
Respondents' argument today really

19

assumes the answer to the inquiry when

20

Respondent argues that the parties never would

21

have wanted to arbitrate wholly groundless

22

claims of arbitrability.

23

The exact same argument could be made

24

where the underlying substantive claims are

25

frivolous.

The argument could be made that the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
66
1

parties would never have wanted for that to go

2

to the arbitrator and would have instead wanted

3

a court to short-circuit that inquiry.

4

But this Court in AT&T Technologies

5

made clear that, even if a court thinks that a

6

claim is not arguable, it is still obligated to

7

send that claim to arbitration, where the

8

parties have so intended.

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It is a little bit

10

different, though, Mr. Shanmugam, because in -­

11

in the case that you said, if it's really

12

groundless, you expect that the arbitrator will

13

get rid of it just as fast as the court will

14

get rid of it.

15

What makes this case a little bit

16

different from that is that, here, all the

17

arbitrator is going to do is to send it back to

18

the court.

19

sense does that make?

20

And you might think:

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, what

But the arbitrator

21

will make that determination presumably

22

efficiently, will do so at the outset of the

23

proceedings, and, of course, we're assuming

24

here that the parties contracted to have the

25

arbitrator make that determination presumably

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
67
1

for the same reason that parties arbitrate -­

2

parties agree to have arbitrators make merits

3

determinations, because they conclude that that

4

will be a more efficient and cheaper way of

5

resolving the relevant issue.

6

And Respondent has no answer for

7

Justice Sotomayor's question about this Court's

8

decision in Rent-A-Center, which provides that,

9

where the parties have remitted the issue of

10

arbitrability to the arbitrator, it should be

11

treated just like any other issue.

12

And what Respondent is asking this

13

Court to do is to allow courts to make merits

14

determinations on the issue of arbitrability

15

even in the face of a delegation.

16

And that brings me -­

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Assuming for sake

18

of argument only, hypothetically, that we

19

disagree with you, there -- there, in fact, can

20

be a wholly groundless ground -- pardon the pun

21

-- do you lose -­

22

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well -­

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- under your

24

question presented?

Assuming that I thought,

25

again, presuming only, that you had an arguable

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
68
1
2

claim.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

We -- we continue to

3

believe that we have a valid claim of

4

arbitrability and certainly not a wholly

5

groundless one.

6

this case gets to the arbitrator on that issue,

7

we will make that argument.

And if this Court vacates and

8

And I would note parenthetically -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But you don't

10

under the question presented if I -- if we

11

disagree with you?

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We didn't present a

13

question concerning the application of the

14

wholly groundless exception.

15

that's obviously a case-specific determination.

16

But I do think that this case illustrates the

17

danger of the wholly groundless exception.

To be sure,

18

There would be a dangerous pliability

19

to that standard regardless of what words this

20

Court puts on a page.

21

illustrates that.

22

And this case

And so, in addition to the

23

inefficiency of this standard, I would point to

24

that pliability as reasons why this Court as a

25

policy matter should not adopt this exception,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
69
1

an exception that, as you point out, Justice

2

Sotomayor, has been applied in only a very

3

small number of cases since the Federal Circuit

4

of all people first recognized this exception

5

about a decade ago.

6

And so it simply would not be worth

7

the candle to filter out the truly frivolous

8

claims, particularly where there are remedies

9

available, sanctions remedies available for

10

Justice Breyer's Crimea hypothetical and any

11

other hypothetical one might imagine.

12
13
14

And I think it's very hard to look at
the -­
JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, but in the law,

15

I mean, normally, in the law, when a judge has

16

something frivolous, he says so.

So -- so you

17

have your thing on the one side.

So it's like

18

a forum selection clause.

19

side is a natural reluctance, when you have

20

something absolutely frivolous, not to say.

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But on the other

There are certainly

22

cases in the law more generally -­

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

24
25

arbitration.

It's not just

It's all over the place.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I -- I recognize that,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
70
1

for instance, in the context of administrative

2

law there are cases that stand for the

3

proposition that, where an administrative

4

agency concludes that it would be futile to

5

have a hearing, the agency has the power not to

6

hold the hearing.

7

But this case is different from any of

8

those cases because what Respondent is arguing

9

is that, where the parties have agreed to have

10

one decision-maker make a determination,

11

another decision-maker has the power to

12

short-circuit that determination.

13

And, after all, the fundamental policy

14

of the FAA is to enforce arbitration agreements

15

according to their terms.

16

groundless exception would create a way around

17

that policy.

18
19

And we would respectfully submit that
the judgment should, therefore, be vacated.

20
21
22
23
