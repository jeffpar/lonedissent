Gundy versus the United States.

Ms. Baumgartel.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH BAUMGARTEL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:

11

SORNA's delegation provision grants

12

unguided power to the nation's top prosecutor

13

to expand the scope of criminal laws and to

14

impose burdensome, sometimes lifetime

15

registration requirements on hundreds of

16

thousands of individuals.

17

law-making and executive power in precisely the

18

way that the Constitution was designed to

19

prohibit.

20

It combines criminal

This delegation is unconstitutional.

21

This delegation can be distinguished from every

22

delegation that has previously been upheld by

23

this Court due to a combination of its total

24

lack of standard and the nature and power -­

25

nature and significance of the delegated power.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

Unlike other delegations that this

2

Court has approved, SORNA has no standard to

3

guide the Attorney General's exercise of

4

discretion.

5

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, the

6

government says that they do have a standard

7

and it's the -- apply the prohibition or the

8

requirements in the law to the maximum extent

9

feasible.

10

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Your Honor, that

11

language does not appear anywhere in the

12

statutory text, nor can it be derived from the

13

sources that the government cites.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What about the list

15

that's contained in, what is it, 20901, the -­

16

the list of past offenders?

17

of those people would be required to register?

18

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

On your view, none

That's not correct.

19

So one important thing about this case is that

20

every -- every state had an existing sex

21

offender registration system prior to SORNA's

22

enactment, and those registration systems would

23

remain in effect regardless of whether SORNA

24

existed or not.

25

Petitioner was required to register under

And so, for example,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

existing Maryland law, and so would the vast

2

majority of sex offenders who were also then

3

required to reregister under SORNA.

4

These state registration systems had

5

been in existence, many of them, since the

6

early '90s, but since 1996, every state had its

7

own registration system.

8
9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But they would

be -- they would not come under the federal

10

registration system, which was the purpose of

11

SORNA to create.

12

be covered by the federal registration

13

requirement.

14

None of those examples would

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Well, as -- as this

15

Court held in Reynolds, the Congress left it to

16

the Attorney General to determine whether SORNA

17

would apply retroactively at all.

18

Congress declined to make the initial decision

19

as to whether any pre-Act offender should be

20

required to register.

21

how Congress had approached registration

22

schemes in the past.

23

And so

This was consistent with

Congress had previously enacted

24

registration legislation that conditioned state

25

funding on requiring certain things from sex

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

offender registries, and in each of those prior

2

cases, Congress had not made the law

3

retroactive.

4

strange about Congress doing this.

5

And so there's -- there's nothing

As the Court held in Reynolds, it then

6

gave the Attorney General full authority to

7

decide whether the law should be applied

8

retroactively, so the initial on/off

9

determination, but then as well how it should

10

apply, which offenders should be included, if

11

it should extend all the way back to 20, 30, 40

12

years.

13

provided to the Attorney General in making -­

There was absolutely no guidance

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose the -­

15

the statute said that the Attorney General

16

shall have the authority to determine the

17

application of this subchapter to pre-enactment

18

offenders as public safety and fairness

19

requires.

20

the Non-Delegation Doctrine?

21

Would that be a -- a violation of

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Yes, Your Honor.

22

Given the subject matter of this delegation,

23

Congress needs to provide more guidance than

24

something along the lines of "in the public

25

interest."

And -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about the most

2

famous regulation, that I think people in this

3

room would imagine, Rule 10b-5?

4

10b-5 is promulgated under a statute that says

5

the SEC can forbid the use of any manipulative

6

device -- that's like the sex offender part -­

7

in contravention of such rules as are

8

appropriate in the public interest.

9

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

I mean, Rule

So there are -- there

10

are a few distinctions.

11

obviously, is a different body than the

Attorney General, and so this is a point where

the Court's due process and delegation concerns

converge.

16

body that is the regulatory lawmaker and the

17

body that is the prosecutor.

One is that the SEC,

And it's important from the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it only the

19

Attorney General who falls within the rule that

21
22
23

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

That's something that

exacerbates this delegation.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, but -- but I'm -­

24

look, the SEC has a rule such as we know,

25

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

-- some more specific

15

congressional guidance when this power is

delegated.

17

And a few things to say.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

First -­

Sorry, you're

18

answering Justice Breyer yes, that all 300,000

19

of those -- whatever the number is, of those

20

delegations are wrong?

21
22
23

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

No, that's absolutely

not our position.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So what

24

distinguishes those -- that delegation or those

25

delegations from the example that Justice Alito

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

gave you?

2

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

So, in each of the

3

prior delegations that this Court has upheld,

4

there has actually been some standard in the

5

delegation provision, even if it was what the

6

Court might consider to be a broad standard.

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there are

8

standards here.

9

General, it's the Congress that defines what

10

crimes will require registration, where, and

11

when the individual is required to register, of

12

what information is necessary, and the

13

penalties for failure to register.

14

specified by Congress.

15

doesn't -- is not at liberty to prescribe when,

16

where, how, what crimes.

17

Congress.

18

I mean, it's not the Attorney

All that is

The Attorney General

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

All that is done by

But none of those

19

very detailed provisions of SORNA that Congress

20

set forth apply to pre-Act offenders.

21

Attorney General was given the power both to

22

decide whether the law applied to pre-Act

23

offenders and then how it should apply.

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

Well, that gets back

to the question that the Chief Justice started

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

with, because it seems that there is some

2

language in the statute that supports the

3

government's reading, that this is a statute

4

that basically says register all pre-Act

5

offenders as far as possible, with some

6

understanding that there are feasibility

7

considerations that may make immediate

8

registration of everybody impossible.

9

comprehensiveness but moderated with a

10

So

feasibility understanding.

11

And I think you would point to three

12

things.

You would point to the preamble, which

13

talks about a comprehensive national system.

14

think you would point then to the definition,

15

which says that the term "sex offender" means

16

an individual, any individual, an individual

17

who was convicted of a sex offense.

18

think, to get in the idea of feasibility, you

19

might look to the -- the delegation provision

20

itself, which talks about categories of sex

21

offenders who are unable to comply with

22

subsection (b).

I

And I

23

So both comprehensiveness as moderated

24

by some flexibility -- some -- some feasibility

25

constraint seems in the statute as long as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

you're taking the statute as a whole.

2

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

So there -- there are

3

a few problems with reading it that way.

4

start with the fact that in J.W. Hampton, the

5

Court emphasized that the intelligible

6

principle had to be clear from the legislative

7

act itself.

8

Court is looking through other provisions -­

9

To

And so, to the extent that the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

From the legislative

10

act itself meaning only from the delegation

11

provision?

12
13

MS. BAUMGARTEL:
legislative act.

14

And so to start -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

legislative act.

16

statute.

17

From -- so from the

Well, this is the

These are all parts of the

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

That's right.

And in

18

Panama Refining, the Court rejected the idea

19

that if there was a narrow delegation provision

20

that did not contain any standards, that that

21

could then be governed and given content by the

22

general preamble to the Act, which is exactly

23

the argument that the government is making

24

here.

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, but when we are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

thinking about non-delegation, it's essentially

2

a statutory interpretation question, which it

3

seems should be governed by the same rules of

4

statutory interpretation that we use elsewhere.

5

And we never look only to one

6

provision.

7

context of other provisions, including purpose

8

provisions.

9

We look to one provision in a

So we've -- if you look at Justice

10

Scalia's -- Justice Scalia was a pretty

11

committed textualist -- if you look at his

12

separate opinion in Reynolds, he clearly is

13

looking to the purpose provision of this Act

14

and saying it demands comprehensiveness.

15

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

So, Your Honor, I -­

16

I agree 100 percent with you that this could be

17

a statutory interpretation issue, but we would

18

prevail under that.

19

The problem with the government's

20

statutory interpretation argument is that the

21

delegation provision here is not ambiguous.

22

gives plenary authority to the Attorney

23

General.

24

statutory context or legislative history,

25

things to interpret that statute, that's

When the Court looks to, say, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

generally when the text itself is ambiguous and

2

provides for two different plausible readings,

3

but here that's not the situation.

4
5
6

I just note Justice Scalia was
dissenting, of course, in Reynolds because -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

He -- he was

7

dissenting, but nine Justices in Reynolds all

8

had the same view of this statute, which is

9

that this statute demanded comprehensiveness in

10

the registration of pre-Act sex offenders.

11

In other words, both in the majority

12

and in the dissent, this was the one point in

13

common, that they said this statute was

14

designed for something and this statute did

15

something, that it insisted that "sex offender"

16

should be read broadly to include any

17

individual who was convicted of a sex offense

18

and that all those people should be registered,

19

you know, with some feasibility recognition.

20

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

So I'd like to

21

address both comprehensiveness and the

22

definition of "sex offender" while also noting

23

that, of course, if Congress had actually

24

wanted that construction, it would have been

25

very easy for it to simply say that.

The -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:
said it.

3

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

5

every single one of us?

6

Well, but nine of us

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

The preamble -­
Were we all wrong,

Your Honor, I -- I

7

don't believe that's what Reynolds says, but

8

just with respect, because comprehensive is

9

coming up so many times, the preamble states

10

that it is a comprehensive national

11

registration system.

12

In the same way that the National

13

Gallery is a comprehensive art museum, that

14

doesn't mean that it has every painting that

15

has ever been made.

16

different meanings.

Comprehensive can have

17

In this context, SORNA is a

18

40-something provision statute that addresses

19

every aspect of sex offender registration, not

20

just who should register but information

21

sharing among jurisdictions, the Internet

22

design of websites for public registration,

23

civil commitment of sex offenders, the use of

24

federal law enforcement resources to assist

25

with state registration systems.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

These various provisions comprise the

2

comprehensive national registration system, and

3

there's no indication that that general

4

preamble meant that every pre-Act offender had

5

to be registered.

6

There was a House bill that was

7

rejected that was pending at the same time that

8

would have both made it explicitly retroactive

9

and that included a definition of "sex

10

offender" that explicitly said offenders

11

convicted either before or after the enactment

12

of this Act.

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

I guess I have -­
I guess -­
-- two quick -- I'm

sorry.

17

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, I guess where

18

I get stuck on -- on the preamble argument is

19

that normally we -- we, when we're doing

20

statutory interpretation, prefer the more

21

specific statutory provision over the more

22

general.

23

dealing with pre-enactment offenders says

24

unambiguously that the Attorney General decides

25

whether, how, when, and who, even who.

And the specific statutory section

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So you

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

don't even know if you're going to be subject

2

to this law.

3

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Yes.
How do people even

5

know who is going to be included in this class

6

until they hear from the Attorney General?

7

I -- I'm having trouble thinking of another

8

delegation in which this Court has ever allowed

9

the chief prosecutor of the United States to

And

10

write the criminal law for those he's going to

11

prosecute.

12

We say that vague criminal laws must

13

be stricken.

We've just repeated that last

14

term.

15

Attorney General of the United States to

16

determine who he's going to prosecute?

What's vaguer than a blank check to the

17

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

19

That's your

argument stated very, very concisely.

20

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

21

(Laughter.)

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

23

Yes.

I'll cede my time.

Well, then I'll take

back my time.

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, suppose what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

this was -- what was at stake here was civil

2

liability rather than -- suppose what was at

3

stake here was civil liability rather than

4

criminal liability.

5

argument?

6

Would you make the same

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

That would -- that

7

would certainly be a much closer case.

8

argument is that -- that SORNA would still be

9

unconstitutional simply because of the total

10
11

Our

lack of standard.
Even in cases like NBC or American

12

Power & Light where the Court has upheld

13

arguably very broad delegations, there has been

14

some standard in the law that, even if

15

seemingly broad as written, drew upon an

16

existing body of established law.

17

So, for example, in NBC, the public

18

interest, convenience, and necessity

19

certification for licensing was an established

20

body of law, that it was a certification that

21

states had made to public service industries

22

since roughly the 1870s.

23
24
25

There's no existing body of law to
give context -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

So if you compare what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

we have before us with the statute that says -­

2

gives or authorizes the Attorney General to

3

devise a rule to protect public safety,

4

feasibility, and consideration of individual

5

rights, that's the difference between a

6

improper delegation and a proper delegation?

7
8

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Certainly

--

9
10

Perhaps.

JUSTICE ALITO:

In the civil context.

Let's start there.

11

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Certainly, the

12

Congressional guidance is the difference.

13

this just comes back to the purpose of the test

14

itself.

15

test is that it's not a delegation of

16

legislative authority because Congress itself

17

has made the key legislative decisions.

18

And

The idea of the intelligible principle

Here, with respect to pre-Act

19

offenders, Congress has not made any of the

20

decisions, despite the extremely detailed

21

framework that there is for post-Act

22

registration.

23

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Do you think the

24

Attorney General could, in that retroactivity,

25

have a different set of offenders than the text

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

of FORNA -- SORNA itself, have different

2

requirements for where and when the

3

registration is to occur?

4

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Yes.

I -- and this

5

is something the Court contemplated in

6

Reynolds, where it noted that 20913(d), the

7

delegation provision, essentially gave the

8

Attorney General three different spheres of

9

authority.

He could decide whether the Act

10

applied to pre-Act offenders, whether it

11

applied to pre-implementation offenders, and

12

then how it applied to those offenders.

13

And the Court recognized that he

14

might, for example, want to set different

15

registration rules for different classes of

16

pre-Act offenders, and that was contemplated

17

and permitted by the broad plenary grant of

18

authority.

19

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

What -- what

20

if the Act said that it applies to pre-Act

21

offenders and there was a provision saying the

22

Attorney General may waive the requirements of

23

this Act when he determines that it's not

24

feasible to apply them?

25

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Yeah -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And the

2

Attorney General says, you know, I don't think

3

it's feasible to apply this to pre-Act

4

offenders, so I waive the Act with respect to

5

pre-Act offenders.

6

Is that okay?

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

So if -- if the Act

7

said this -- Congress determines that this

8

should apply to pre-Act offenders and then gave

9

the Attorney General a limited power to grant

10

exemptions, something which is basically the

11

opposite of what this as written does, that

12

would likely be constitutional, particularly if

13

the -- if Congress provided some guidance

14

around where -­

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Even though

16

the consequences are the same -- the

17

consequences are the same with respect to

18

whether or -- who's making the decision about

19

whether the criminal laws should apply to whom?

20

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Respectfully, the -­

21

the consequences are not the same.

22

first instance, Congress has made the decision.

23

And then they have afforded the Attorney

24

General a power that is in -- first, if there

25

is guidance provided with respect to the

3

say it isn't.

4

exemptions to this Act with respect to

5

particular categories of offenders.

6

The Attorney General may issue

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Even -- even if, that

7

would still be much closer to being

8

constitutional because Congress has made the

9

initial decision and has afforded the Attorney

10

General a power that is something more akin to

11

traditional prosecutorial discretion.

12

It's not the same, but this was the

13

point that Justice Scalia, joined by Justice

14

Ginsburg, made in dissent in Reynolds, which is

15

that that is much -- that seems closer to being

16

constitutional because the power that the

17

Attorney General has is closer to a traditional

18

clemency or prosecutorial discretion power.

19

In this case, however, the -- the

20

statute is truly worded in the opposite

21

fashion.

22

any pre-Act offenders.

23

whether it should apply is left to the sole

24

discretion of the Attorney General, with -­

25

It does not apply of its own force to
And the question of

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Don't we routinely

Heritage Reporting Corporation

read into statute limitations in order to save

2

its constitutionality?

3

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Yes.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

We do do that

5

routinely.

6

cases limits.

7

feasibility here so unusual, given the three

8

contextual signals that Justice Kagan listed

9

previously?

10

And we have read into delegation
So why is the reading in a

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

So there are three

11

reasons.

12

interpretation that the Court rejected in

13

Reynolds.

14

government's argument in Reynolds, and the

15

Court said no, that's not a plausible

16

construction of this statute.

17

One is that that is essentially the

That -- that was squarely the

The second reason is that, in the

18

context of the intelligible principle, it is

19

essential that Congress itself state the

20

intelligible principle.

21

this in American Trucking v. Whitman, where

22

there the agency itself had tried to propose a

23

limiting construction to the delegation.

24

the Court rejected that and said that the

25

imposition of that limiting construction would

The Court addressed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

be the exercise of the constitutional -- the

2

legislative power itself.

3

imposition of that limiting construction would

4

be unconstitutional because it's exercising the

5

legislative power.

6

And so the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Can we go back to

7

-- mention your third.

But on the first folded

8

in, in Reynolds, we said that it would have

9

been strange, indeed, for anyone to imagine

10

that Congress intended the AG -- I'm trying to

11

put it into a positive -- that Congress

12

intended the AG to -- to apply the Act

13

retroactively.

14

them to imagine that he or she wouldn't, that

15

there might have been limitations because of

16

some feasibility difficulties, but no one

17

imagined the AG would exempt everyone.

18

It would have been strange for

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

The intelligible

19

principle cannot be the Court's speculation

20

about what Congress thinks the Attorney General

21

might do.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But we're

23

speculating from the Act itself.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

It's interpreting.

It's not speculating.

So if the -- if the best

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

interpretation -- and I realize you don't agree

2

with this, but -- so I'm posing it as a

3

hypothetical.

4

the Act is the SG's interpretation, do you

5

agree that that would not pose a delegation

6

problem?

7

If the best interpretation of

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

No, I don't agree.

8

And so if the -- my friend uses different

9

formulations of their interpretation.

10

Sometimes it's to the maximum extent feasible.

11

Sometimes it's to the extent feasible.

12

Sometimes it's to the extent practicable.

13
14
15

And I would argue that there is -­
there are differences there.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Let's -- let's call

16

it, which is, I think, consistent with what

17

Reynolds said, to the maximum extent feasible.

18

In other words, what the Act is telling the AG

19

is go register pre-Act offenders, except if you

20

find it unfeasible.

21
22
23

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

I -- again, that's -­

that's nowhere in the statute, and -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, I -- I

24

understand that you think that.

But if the

25

statute -- if the -- if that is the best

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

interpretation of the statute, would it pose a

2

delegation problem?

3

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

That likely would be

4

constitutional if you could read into the

5

statute a command to the Attorney General to

6

register pre-Act offenders to the maximum

7

extent feasible, although, you know, as Justice

8

Rehnquist articulated in Industrial Union, the

9

benzene case, there is still a question about

10
11

what feasibility means.
And in this context particularly,

12

because these are not -- this is not a

13

technical scientific area.

14

question of how much air particle, at what cost

15

can be taken from the environment.

16

really the fundamental weighing of liberty

17

versus security interests, the sorts of

18

decisions that the people's legislative body is

19

supposed to make and not supposed to delegate

20

to the chief prosecutor.

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

This is not a

This is

Are we supposed to do

22

that -- are we supposed to, in your opinion,

23

start distinguishing among the 300,000 and say,

24

well, you have a weak standard if all that's at

25

interest is the cost of pollution or something,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

but you have to have a strong standard where,

2

in fact, it's what you said, liberty and so on,

3

and a medium standard perhaps for the SEC?

4

don't -- I don't know what we do about the SEC.

5

And there are 300,000, approximately.

6

Maybe there are only 200,000.

7

you're suggesting we ought to do?

8

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

9

But is that what
Yes?

Yes, and the -- the

JUSTICE BREYER:

Yes, all right,

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

I should -- Your

300,000.

12
13

Honor, I should -- I'm not conceding the

14

300,000.

15
16

No?

I

JUSTICE BREYER:

17

(Laughter.)

18

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

But this is -- this

19

is what the Court said in American Trucking v.

20

Whitman, that the amount of guidance required

21

depends on the scope of the delegated power.

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

Okay.

So, if we're

23

supposed to go through the 200,000 or 100,000

24

or whatever they are, what are the different

25

categories where it's tough, not so tough, in

your opinion?

2
3

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Your Honor, the

question is not a matter of tough versus -­

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, you see what I

5

mean, categories where Congress can delegate

6

with an SEC-type standard or the standard here

7

in categories where Congress has to be more

8

specific.

9

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

The -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- what in your

11

opinion are the right categories?

12

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

The -- so the factors

13

about SORNA that are critical include the fact

14

that it contemplates criminal sanctions.

15

Touby, this Court recognized that its

16

precedents supported requiring greater guidance

17

for the promulgation of regulations that

18

contemplate criminal sanctions.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In

But are -- isn't that

20

all over the place we have confronted

21

delegation challenges to civil regulations

22

whose violation will result in criminal

23

sanctions?

24

those cases, but I'll just give you three:

25

Kollock is like that, Grimaud is like that,

So, I mean, there are numerous of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

Avent is like that.

2

So these are all places where the

3

delegation is to a civil regulation, as it is

4

here, but if you violate that regulation that

5

some secretary or attorney general or whatever

6

has written, you're going to face criminal

7

sanctions.

8
9

So what's the difference between this
case and all those other cases where we said

10

that's -- you know, that's -- criminal

11

sanctions is not what matters?

12

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Well, Kollock is the

13

perfect example because this is very different

14

than oleomargarine label.

15

question of Congress -­

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

This is not a

You know, you can say

17

that, and it's easy to make fun of

18

oleomargarine labels, but the person who

19

violated that provision was going to go to

20

prison in the same way that the person who

21

violates this provision is going to go to

22

prison.

23

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

It's not making fun,

24

Your Honor.

It's that there are certain

25

fundamental choices about a statutory scheme

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

that Congress itself must make.

2

Congress can say that there needs to be

3

particular packaging and a label, and then it

4

can delegate or assign to an agency the power

5

to design that label.

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And so

The point I was making

7

is that all of these are civil regulations.

8

The delegation is to say you write the -- we're

9

going to give you some degree of discretion to

10

write the civil regulation, understanding that

11

if somebody violates that, that person is going

12

to jail.

13

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Your Honor, may I

14

answer your question and then reserve the

15

remainder of my time?

16

Just the -- the question is always the

17

nature and significance of the delegated power,

18

and it -- it is perfectly fine for Congress to

19

permit agencies to fill in the details or

20

otherwise implement statutes, but not to make

21

these sorts of fundamental policy choices.

22

Thank you.

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

take this scheme and implement it with respect

to pre-Act offenders, recognizing that there

are going to be some transitional issues.

4

That kind of implementation is a

classic executive function.

just now, that if the statute is best read in

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

significant category of cases.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

It's

comprehensive.

23

to happen there, and what they've said is the

24

Attorney General gets to decide.

25

They've told you what's going

MR. WALL:

Oh, it -- it's certainly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

true that Congress made certain legislative

2

judgments about what sex offenses would

3

qualify, how long people would have to register

4

for.

5

relates to sex means you've got to register for

6

a lifetime.

They didn't say every offense that

That is -- that is certainly true.

7

But, once they've defined the bounds

8

of the people they want into the system going

9

forward, then they said to the Attorney

10

General:

Your job is to get as many of the

11

existing offenders who fall into that universe

12

into the registries as you can, recognizing

13

there are going to be some practical barriers.

14

You're going to have to specify the

15

applicability of the requirements in a way -­

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

17

MR. WALL:

But, Mr. Wall -­

-- to get them in.

That's

very narrow language.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- you didn't -- the

20

government didn't make that argument in

21

Reynolds.

22

argument in Reynolds.

23

(d) is the more specific provision and the

24

nature of the comprehensiveness, as the Chief

25

Justice indicated, for purposes of

The government made the opposite
The government said that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

pre-enactment offenders was that the Attorney

2

General gets to decide, and the Attorney

3

General could decide to do nothing, the

4

government said, the Attorney General could

5

decide to include some offenders, none of the

6

offenders, or all of the pre-enactment

7

offenders.

8

The government said that it could then

9

determine which of the Act provisions it wished

10

to, in a Chinese menu manner, apply to these

11

people it had chosen.

12

the Attorney General could change his or her

13

mind about all of this at any given time.

14

The government then said

And, in fact, the Attorney General has

15

changed his mind from time to time on these

16

matters.

17

just told us with the government's prior

18

representations in this case?

19

So how do you square with what you've

MR. WALL:

Well, the Attorney General

20

has never changed his or her mind with respect

21

to the registration duty for individuals, but

22

-- but to go squarely to the question -­

23
24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

There have been

changes in -­
MR. WALL:

Only with respect to the

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. WALL:

All right.

-- not with the individual

5

duty on offenders to come forward and present

6

themselves and register.

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Attorney General

8

Holder changed the guidance provided by -- by

9

the prior Attorney General, correct?

10

MR. WALL:

He narrowed the states'

11

obligations to give the states a little more

12

breathing room.

13

duty to step forward and register has always

14

been constant.

15

That's true.

don't think that, reading our brief in

21

We came

That clearly means, since we know that

22

they want everybody in, that we should read

23

that like a waiver provision.

24

the Court disagreed with us on that and said

25

the default rule was different but in the

And to be sure,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

process accepted exactly our argument as the

2

premise that the default rule didn't matter

And so I think -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

MR. WALL:

9

Mr. Wall -­

-- everybody was working

off of that page in Reynolds.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- your -- your

10

brief in Reynolds is very important to me.

11

I read it the way Justice Gorsuch does, assume

12

his hypothetical, that you, in fact, said it

13

was an on and off button that the -- that the

14

Attorney General could turn on and off.

15

that's the position you took then, what does

16

that do to you now?

17

MR. WALL:

If

Oh, that's -- to be clear,

Justice Sotomayor, that's exactly the same

position I'm taking here today.

I'm addressing a

question that wasn't squarely before the Court

Now you're reading

That's -­

8

MR. WALL:

Well -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I understand

10

Justice Gorsuch's point that you said he could

11

turn it on and off as he decided.

12

MR. WALL:

Yes.

That's the Attorney

13

General's authority as a statutory matter.

14

That's what the statute means.

15

statute means the same thing we said in

16

Reynolds, though the Court disagrees in the

17

default rule.

18

I believe the

The separate question is, is there

19

guidance provided to the Attorney General in

20

the statute on how he should exercise that

21

on/off switch authority?

22

not before the Court in Reynolds and not

23

briefed in Reynolds, the answer to that is

24

pretty obviously yes.

25

And that question,

I mean, this falls well inside a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

number of the delegations that the Court has

2

looked at because, here, it's not as if there

3

is some standard in the statute like public

4

interest or fair and reasonable rates, where

5

the executive is really doing the fleshing in.

6

Here, Congress set forth all the

7

rules.

8

requirements.

9

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

10
11

It made judgments about all the

MR. WALL:

What do you say -­

And all it said to the

Attorney -­

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- about the ACLU's

13

argument on that score that, under your view,

14

that Congress could have simply enacted a

15

statute with respect to post-enactment

16

offenders that mirrored the language of (d) and

17

said, well, it's up to the Attorney General to

18

come up with a comprehensive and feasible

19

registration regime in the public interest?

20

You'd be here defending that, wouldn't you?

21

MR. WALL:

Justice Gorsuch, it would

22

be a much broader delegation.

Under this

23

Court's cases, you'd need more of a general

24

policy.

25

wouldn't apply it going forward.

It's not at all clear why Congress

Why?

3

affected by this delegation.

4

MR. WALL:

What's the

A half a million people are

Yes, if Congress found

5

there are real practical problems with applying

6

it even going forward, here is our general

7

policy to the Attorney General, I don't know

8

that it would be importantly different from

9

saying to the Attorney General in Touby which

10

drugs will be controlled substances under the

11

Act, or -- or in Union Bridge, which obstruct

12

-- which bridges will we think obstruct the

13

rivers, or in Grimaud, who will be allowed to

14

graze on federal land?

15

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Could you answer my

16

question?

17

statute that mimicked (d) with respect to

18

post-enactment offenders, and in -- in -- in

19

which case why does Congress bother to

20

legislate SORNA at all?

21

Would you be here defending a

MR. WALL:

It's very difficult to know

22

in that situation, Justice Gorsuch, what the

23

equivalent practical problems would be for why

24

Congress didn't apply it.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So you might defend

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

that statute too?

2

MR. WALL:

3

saying is I -- I don't know.

4

practical problems that would have required

5

Congress to legislate in that way, so it's very

6

difficult to imagine that that statute would

7

pass muster.

8
9

No, I -- I -- I -- what I'm
I don't see any

But if there were similar practical
problems and if they supplied a general policy,

10

it wouldn't be importantly different from

11

Loving or Grimaud or Fahey or Kollock or Union

12

Bridge.

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Wall, can you

14

tell me how -- how this retroactivity works?

15

So let's take somebody who was convicted of a

16

sex offense 30 years ago.

17

record ever since.

18

He's had a clean

How do you -- first, tell me how such

19

a person gets notice of the registration

20

requirement.

21

MR. WALL:

So he's -- he's only

22

required to register if he's a Tier III

23

offender, so if he's got a really grave sex

24

offense like Petitioner -­

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but let's say

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

he is such an offender, but it was 30 years

2

ago.

3

MR. WALL:

Yes.

So I think he's on

4

notice from the enactment of SORNA and then the

5

Attorney General's interim rule in 2007,

6

carried forward in the final rule in 2010, that

7

there's an across-the-board registration

8

requirement.

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So he's a -- he has

10

to know what the Attorney General's regulation

11

is?

12

They can be charged with -- with failure to

13

register, even though nobody -- no one ever

14

gave them notice that they had to register?

15

There's no notice given to these people.

MR. WALL:

I suppose you could try to

16

bring an as-applied due process challenge.

17

course, Petitioner's not going to be able to do

18

that.

19

he left the BOP's custody, both in writing and

20

orally, that he needed to register when he

21

moved to New York, and then he failed to do it.

22

So I -- I take the point that there could be

23

as-applied notice problems, but I don't think

24

that there's one here.

25

Of

Petitioner was informed in 2012 before

And to get back to -- to the -- to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

colloquy I was having with Justice Gorsuch, I

2

do think at the end of the day this is not a

3

provision that just lays out a general standard

4

and then requires all of the fleshing in.

5

That, the Court has held, is permissible,

6

provided you supply a general policy.

7

But it really is inside even that,

8

because Congress set up a pretty reticulated

9

scheme, made a lot of judgments along the way.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Do you think that if

11

there were a new attorney general who came in

12

and said, you know, I think that this

13

registration stuff has just gone overboard, and

14

I'm going to start making some exceptions with

15

respect to pre-Act offenders, because I think

16

it's just unfair to penalize them for the rest

17

of their lives, could the attorney general do

18

that?

19

MR. WALL:

No, we don't think the

20

attorney general could make judgments on the

21

basis, other than feasibility, and disagree

22

with Congress's policy judgments.

23

And if the Court had any doubt about

24

that, it should construe the statute more

25

narrowly, in the way I think is the most

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

reasonable interpretation, so as to avoid the

2

constitutional problem.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And when you say the

4

Attorney General could -- tell me what you

5

think the Attorney General cannot do, given the

6

language of this statute and given the language

7

of Reynolds.

8

MR. WALL:

So I don't think the

9

Attorney General could say:

Look, I know

10

Congress set up three tiers with registration

11

links of 15, 25 years, and life, but I'm going

12

to require you to register, but only for a few

13

years.

14

It's perfectly feasible.

I could

15

require you all to register and there would be

16

no problem on the state registries, but I just

17

disagree with Congress's judgment that you

18

ought to be -- you ought to register.

19

JUSTICE BREYER:

20

MR. WALL:

21
22

Is -- is -­

I don't think the Attorney

General could do that.
JUSTICE BREYER:

I'm -- I'm trying to

23

think of -- I think Ms. Baumgartel was trying

24

to make a point that in my mind is something

25

like this:

That the executive branch has many

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

different functions.

2

different things.

3

They do all kinds of

One of the things they do is prosecute

4

people.

5

and all these other agencies because they have

6

other things to do.

7

Now it's quite different from the SEC

And, moreover, there's a safeguard

8

going through the Department of Justice.

And

9

there is a particular danger when you combine

10

prosecuting a person with the writing of the

11

law under which you prosecute.

12

And the danger is captured in the bill

13

of attainder clause, it's captured maybe in ex

14

post facto clause, it's captured in the word

15

liberty, and it is that particular danger that

16

means where you have a person whose job is

17

prosecuting, be careful, especially careful

18

that that person cannot also write the law

19

under which he prosecutes, because there we

20

risk vendetta.

21

Now I think my interpretation of what

22

she's saying is something like that.

23

is your response?

24
25

MR. WALL:

So what

So I do think that plays

itself out in certain rules, like not deferring

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

to the executive in the interpretation of

2

criminal statutes, but the Court's considered

3

that argument twice in the non-delegation

4

context and rejected it both times.

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

What -- which -­

6

MR. WALL:

7

the same argument.

8

delegate to the executive branch which

9

substances will be controlled under the Act

In Touby, they made exactly
They said, look, you can't

10

because they're both defining what's illegal to

11

possess and they're prosecuting you.

12

And in Touby, you said, no, not for

13

non-delegation purposes.

That controls from

14

one branch to the other.

Not where the power

15

is allocated within the executive branch.

16

And even more to the point, in Loving,

17

there was the availability of the death

18

penalty.

19

aggravating factors nowhere to be found in the

20

statute, and this Court, where you were

21

actually -- the executive was actually defining

22

the criminal penalty, which is not what the

23

executive has done here.

24

upheld delegations whereby -- this is at page

25

768 of Loving -- we've upheld delegations where

The president was just specifying

This Court said we've

conduct will be criminal, so long as Congress

JUSTICE BREYER:
standards, quite right.

6

MR. WALL:

JUSTICE BREYER:

10
11

That -- those are the

-- fixed the punishment -­
But suppose you put

-MR. WALL:

-- and given the executive

the authority.
JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I -- I see where

12

you're going there.

13

arguing here is basically the Non-Delegation

14

Doctrine, informed perhaps by the need to

15

prevent vendettas in liberty.

16

reverse that.

17

here is a due process argument.

18

liberty-protecting argument.

19

interpreting that liberty-protecting argument,

20

we should inform our thought with

21

non-delegation principles.

22

But -- but what we've been

Suppose you

Suppose you said the problem

MR. WALL:

It is a

And in

Justice Breyer, I just

23

think the non-delegation context is a very odd

24

one in which to try to cache that out, as

25

opposed to -- to vagueness or -- or due

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

process, because it's asking whether Congress

2

has made the basic policy judgments that can

3

inform the executive's exercise of power.

4

And, boy, if -- if the executive can

5

define the availability of the death penalty in

6

Loving and Mistretta, here, it seems well

7

withinside that to say, look, this is a civil

8

requirement; yes, there are criminal penalties

9

that could potentially attach.

But that's a

10

commonplace feature in the law.

11

you what kind of tax return you've got to file.

12

Now not filing that tax return is a criminal

13

violation, but nobody thinks that the IRS is

14

defining the scope of the criminal law, though

15

in some sense it is by telling you what the

16

civil requirement is.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The IRS tells

Well, this

18

is -- this is different in the sense that the

19

Attorney General is deciding what law applies,

20

not whether a particular act or a particular

21

exercise in commercial activity is covered by

22

an Act that certainly applies in a general

23

sense.

24
25

I mean, it's not this -- in those
instances, even in -- in -- in Touby, it's -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

it's exercising fairly refined authority with

2

respect to what activity is covered.

3

Here, it's just saying are you going

4

to be -- it's not just covered by a law; does

5

the law even apply to you?

6

MR. WALL:

Well -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And it seems

8

to me that those -- that -- that's a

9

substantive difference.

10

MR. WALL:

11

Mr. Chief Justice.

12

think that specifying whether the drug you're

13

holding is lawful or unlawful, whether your

14

bridge has to be taken down, whether you can

15

graze on public land, whether your rates are

16

unreasonable is different in kind from whether

17

you have to register going forward and report

18

to the federal government.

19

I don't -- I don't know,
I don't know why we would

Either way, the executive branch tells

20

you whether your conduct brings you within the

21

scope of the law or it doesn't.

22

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but it's

23

-- the bridges, yes.

I mean, the executive

24

branch has to specify what type of bridge needs

25

to be what height or whatever and if it's this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

or that.

But there's another -- it's a

2

different thing when the Attorney General says,

3

okay, here's a law that covers bridges; you get

4

to decide whether it governs at all in

5

particular areas.

6

MR. WALL:

I -- I understand if SORNA

7

didn't have the kind of guidance that it had

8

here, if it hadn't defined the criminal

9

offense, if it hadn't fixed the punishment, if

10

it hadn't set a reticulated scheme on the civil

11

side.

12

of those judgments, there could be more serious

13

problems.

I understand that if it hadn't made all

14

But to do all of that and then say

15

but, look, we know that there's going to be

16

some practical problems, it's not just the

17

timing, the state -- SORNA requires a lot of

18

things:

19

information, provide your DNA, provide your

20

photos, do periodic show-ups.

21

Provide your motor vehicle

And there's no dispute, I think, that

22

the state registries at the time SORNA was

23

passed were not equipped to do all of that.

24

And so Congress, looking at that, said:

25

we've got hundreds of thousands of people out

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Look,

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

there we want to bring into this system.

2

know they can't all come in on day one.

3

There's going to be some transitional issues

4

that we're going to have to work out.

5

person to work those out is the person who for

6

the last 12 years has been dealing with exactly

7

that subject and interacting with the states.

8
9

We

And the

And at the end of the day, that's
really much more about implementation than it

10

is about policy judgment.

11

really is inside of the Grimaud, the Fahey, the

12

outer bound, because you've got an intelligible

13

principle that's anchored in the text of the

14

statute, not always true in some of those

15

cases, like Grimaud and Fahey, and you really

16

have what's much closer to a classic executive

17

function because it's just specifying the

18

applicability of the requirements themselves.

19

I mean, here, it

It's not even like the Attorney

20

General is providing the substance of those

21

requirements.

22

Court has said okay, but I just -- I think

23

we're -­

24
25

And even that, of course, the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Mr. Wall, I -­

I want to develop a little bit what Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

Breyer was after.

2

about the Attorney General's presence in this

3

case as the chief prosecutor and kind of a

4

conflict of interest?

5

instead of feasibility, you were arguing just

6

and reasonable or in the public interest, other

7

standards that might have applied in a -- in a

8

civil delegation context?

9

Is there something unusual

And what if -- what if,

Would you think that the Attorney

10

General of the United States could decide the

11

applicability of a criminal law for a half a

12

million people on the basis of his or her

13

judgment about its public interest or whether

14

it's just and reasonable?

15

do you accept the -- the suggestion of this

16

Court in Touby that delegations in the criminal

17

context involving the Attorney General may

18

merit a heightened standard of review?

19

MR. WALL:

Or -- or would -- or

Justice Gorsuch, I -- I -­

20

I don't think the Court needs to cross that

21

bridge here.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I understand that.

I'm asking you to answer that question.
MR. WALL:
want to try to.

I -- and I want to -- I

I think the Court has had

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

several cases where criminal penalties were

2

indirectly or directly involved, from Grimaud

3

to Yakus, to Loving, Mistretta.

4

suggested, even when faced with this exact

5

argument in Touby, that the bar ought to be

6

raised higher.

It's never

7

But I'll grant that in Touby, the

8

Court said it didn't need to address that,

9

though it had never done that in any of its

10

previous cases, and just say, look, if this

11

statute did that, if it did nothing more than

12

say to the Attorney General register them, you

13

know, as reasonable, with no requirements, no

14

creation of the criminal offense, no fixing of

15

the penalty -­

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No.

Just and

17

reasonable or in the public interest.

18

those be okay or not okay?

19

MR. WALL:

Would

I think, as -- as long as

20

it's done the things it did here, it's created

21

the crime, it's defined the elements -­

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

23

MR. WALL:

Those would be okay?

-- it's fixed the penalty.

24

And then, on the civil side, it has said, and

25

you provided some standard like that in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

statute, the Court's cases indicate that's

2

enough.

3

think that's not enough, this statute does come

4

inside of that because this is not an agency

5

just supplying all of the real content or

6

substance to a broad standard like public

7

interest or just and reasonable.

But I -- I do want to say, even if you

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. WALL:

Is it a right -­

Reading the statute,

10

Congress made a lot of those judgments for

11

itself and left to the Attorney General a much

12

narrower practical problem.

13

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

There's a lot of

14

discussion in our case law about the propriety

15

of the Court reading into statute words, and I

16

think a fundamental issue that Justice Gorsuch

17

has been aiming at is, especially in criminal

18

law, is it just to delegate to the Attorney

19

General a fundamental decision about who gets

20

covered or doesn't get covered by a statute?

21

That seems like -- it seems like at the core of

22

what a law is, if someone does X act, you're

23

covered or you're not.

24
25

And if Congress had said that, we
probably wouldn't have found a retroactivity

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

problem.

But what is the essence of

2

non-delegation that we don't let the

3

legislature define who's a criminal?

4

isn't retroactivity a definition of who's a

5

criminal or not?

6

MR. WALL:

7

Justice Sotomayor.

8
9

And so

So two separate points,

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Or who might be a

criminal because of their acts?

10

MR. WALL:

Two separate points.

11

First, if Congress had given the same authority

12

to the Attorney General and not otherwise

13

expressed any intention with respect to how

14

that authority would be exercised, I'll grant

15

that would be -­

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

17

words that add maximum feasibility -­

18

MR. WALL:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

statute.

There's no plain

So -­
-- in this

So you're -- you're discerning words.

21

MR. WALL:

I am, Justice Sotomayor.

22

And that's my second point.

23

what the Court did in Grimaud, Fahey, Kollock,

24

Loving.

25

principle spelled out in the statute in so many

I'm doing exactly

In none of those was the intelligible

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

words.

And the Court engaged in an

2

interpretive act.

3

whole, and said based on the provisions we

4

have, would a reasonable attorney general

5

understand or a reasonable executive official

6

understand what policy they were meant to

7

pursue in exercising this authority?

It looked at the Act as a

8

And I -- to be honest with you, I

9

think it defies both the text of SORNA and

10

reality to think that Congress was agnostic

11

about whether hundreds of thousands of people

12

who have committed very serious sex offenses,

13

as Petitioner has, should be required to

14

register.

15

SORNA's text, its legislative history, and not

16

come away with the firm and definite notion

17

that Congress wanted as many of those offenders

18

in the system as the Attorney General could get

19

in -­

I think there's no way to read

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

21

MR. WALL: -- and it was just a

22
23

If you take out -­

practical problem of how to accomplish that.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- if you take out

24

legislative history and you take out policy

25

statements, because there are some of my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

colleagues who don't rely on either of those

2

two things, what's left?

3

MR. WALL:

I would say the findings in

4

20901, the statement of express statutory

5

purpose, which this Court has relied on in

6

cases like NBC and New York Central for a

7

comprehensive national system, the inclusive

8

definition of "sex offender," the broad

9

registration requirement in 2913(a), and then

10

the text and title of 913(d), which say that

11

this grant of authority was about addressing

12

the inability to comply.

13

that what spurred this was a practical

14

consideration, a concern by Congress about how

15

to get these people into the system.

We know on its face

16

All of those things taken together, I

17

think, far -- the -- the intelligent principle

18

here far more anchored in the text of this

19

statute.

20

Justice Jackson for the Court looked at the

21

norms of the banking industry.

22

where the Court discerned it from a number of

23

other statutory provisions that I don't think

24

were as definite as what it faces here.

25

Loving, the same thing.

Then take a case like Fahey, where

Or Grimaud,

Kollock, the same

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

thing.

2

I think here you've got an

3

intelligible principle, a general policy that

4

really is anchored in the text of the Act, even

5

apart from legislative history and policy

6

statements and all the rest, which we -- we

7

have not -- we have not relied on in -- in our

8

brief.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

The part that's still

10

gnawing at me, I mean, your basic argument is

11

there is a standard here, that's the end of the

12

case.

13

I have to think through the Non-Delegation

14

Doctrine.

All right.

15

But, in writing it, I guess

So I'm just interested if this strikes

16

any thought in your mind.

17

Securities Act of '34.

18

can't use a manipulative device, that's a

19

fraudulent device, that's the equivalent here

20

of the sex offense.

21

them in contravention of such rules as the SEC

22

may prescribe as appropriate in the public

23

interest.

24
25

Let's take the

What it says is you

It says you cannot use

Suppose instead of that word "SEC,"
everything's the same, but it doesn't say SEC,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

it says Attorney General, so what you have is

2

it is a crime to violate a rule, where it

3

concerns a manipulative device, in violation of

4

such rules as the Attorney General finds

5

appropriate, the difference being we don't

6

think he's an expert on securities, though the

7

SEC is.

8

MR. WALL:

Right.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does that matter?

10

Should it matter?

11

opinion that it might matter?

12

MR. WALL:

Should we suggest in the

So, to the extent it

13

matters, here's what I think you could say in

14

the opinion.

15

If the executive official, the

16

Attorney General, were defining the elements of

17

the offense or defining the criminal

18

punishment, that would raise the Touby

19

question.

20

the executive official is defining a civil

21

requirement, as with the '34 Act, to which

22

criminal consequences can possibly attach, that

23

falls squarely inside a handful of cases where

24

the Court has proved exactly that.

25

But where the Attorney General or

So I think the Court can set aside the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

tougher case than this one where Congress

2

hasn't defined the elements of the offense and

3

fixed the punishment itself but left those

4

things to the executive branch.

5

I do want to say just a word about the

6

harms here before I sit down so that we -- we

7

all understand what's in play.

8

jurisdictions have substantially implemented

9

SORNA.

Eighteen

Of the remaining 32 states, 26 of them

10

have taken federal funds and are attempting to

11

substantially implement, but they're not there

12

yet.

13

If Petitioner prevails, I believe,

14

though Petitioner's briefs don't say, that all

15

of their arguments translate not just from the

16

pre-Act offender clause but also to the

17

pre-implementation clause.

18

right, there will be no federal duty to

19

register in the 32 states that haven't

20

substantially implemented.

21

And if that's

As a matter of federal law, more than

22

half the country will be a sex offender

23

registration-free zone.

24

18 states, they will not be picking up new

25

pre-Act offenders who come into contact with

Even in the remaining

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

the justice system because there will no longer

2

be a duty to register.

3

All told, our best estimate is that

4

we'll lose a couple of thousand people out of

5

the registries every month, and that's not even

6

including tribal areas, where we wouldn't be

7

able to get at non-tribal members.

8
9

And, of course, some substantial
portion of the 4,000 convictions at issue would

10

be in -- in -- in jeopardy of being vacated

11

either on direct or collateral review.

12

SORNA's efficacy, if Petitioner

13

prevails, will not just be sharply curtailed.

14

It will arguably be thoroughly gutted as -- as

15

a matter of how this federal law works.

16

And if it is possible, and we think it

17

is not just possible but the most natural

18

interpretation of the Attorney General's

19

authority to say this is a narrow authority, to

20

specify the applicability of requirements in an

21

on/off way in order to get people into the

22

system, and that interpretation avoids

23

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF SARAH BAUMGARTEL

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

12

MS. BAUMGARTEL:

Thank you.

13

Just to pick up where my friend left

14

off, I want to emphasize that prior to SORNA's

15

enactment, every single state had an existing

16

sex offender registry and those will continue

17

to exist and to require the registration of

18

offenders, regardless of what happens with

19

SORNA.

20

Individuals like Petitioner were

21

required to register under existing state law,

22

and they will still be required to register.

23

This was a law whose retroactive application

24

was opposed by the states, which is part of the

25

reason why only 18 states have implemented it.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

States spoke out against the retroactive

2

application of the law before the Attorney

3

General made his determination.

4

And so states themselves, who are the

5

experts in this area having run registration

6

systems for years, don't want this Act to be

7

fully retroactive.

8
9

My friend emphasized that this
delegation was all about practicality, but the

10

reality is, is that the Attorney General's

11

promulgated rule does not account for

12

practicality in any way, which is further

13

evidence for this Court that to the extent

14

feasible was not the standard of this

15

delegation.

16

That is not the standard that exists

17

in the text.

18

principle that was found by any circuit court

19

to consider this issue.

20

the intelligible principle that the Attorney

21

General himself said that he was acting

22

pursuant to when he issued his regulation.

23

It is not the intelligible

And it was not even

In his final regulation, he said that

24

Congress delegated to him, and I quote, "the

25

discretion to apply SORNA's requirements to sex

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

offenders to the extent that he determines that

2

the public benefits of doing so outweigh any

3

adverse costs."

4

So the Attorney General believed that

5

his discretion was to essentially undertake the

6

fundamental policy determination as to whether

7

the costs outweigh the benefits.

8

view this as an issue of feasibility or

9

practicality.

10

He did not

Finally, I'd just like to emphasize

11

the special nature of this delegation.

This is

12

not licensing.

13

This is the retroactive application of criminal

14

law penalties that affect individual liberty

15

interests in the most profound way.

16

This is the area where the

This is not civil rule-making.

17

Constitution specifies that there must be a

18

division between the law-maker and between the

19

20

delegation is unconstitutional.

And for that reason, this
