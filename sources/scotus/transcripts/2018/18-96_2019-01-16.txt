ORAL ARGUMENT OF SHAY DVORETZKY

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

11

MR. DVORETZKY:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In the wake of the nation's failed

12

experiment with prohibition, the Twenty-First

13

Amendment restored to the states the powers

14

that they previously had under the Wilson and

15

Webb-Kenyon Acts.

16

both before prohibition and in its immediate

17

aftermath, states enacted residency

18

requirements, like Tennessee's, to regulate the

19

sale of alcohol within their territory.

20

In exercising those powers,

All along the way, this Court

21

recognized the states' power to do so as part

22

of their virtually complete control over how to

23

structure the liquor distribution system.

24
25

Under Granholm, that unbroken and
undisputed history is dispositive.

Residency

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

requirements like Tennessee's are protected

2

from dormant Commerce Clause scrutiny because

3

they were authorized by the Wilson and

4

Webb-Kenyon Acts and uniformly considered

5

constitutional at the time of ratification.

6

Respondents offer --

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could I ask you to

8

clarify for me your position?

9

in his dissent, basically said, if your

10

legislature came and said we don't want

11

out-of-state wholesalers, distributors, or

12

retailers to be in our chain of distribution,

13

because they're going to take business away

14

from our local enterprises, period, end of

15

story -- are you saying that the state can do

16

that?

17

Judge Sutton?

18

economic protectionism -- protection against

19

what a state can do?

20

Justice Sutton,

Are you disagreeing with Justice -- with
Or do you think that there's an

MR. DVORETZKY:

So I don't think that

21

there is an economic protectionism exception to

22

the Twenty-First Amendment, but even if there

23

were one, as Judge Sutton recognized in

24

applying his test to the two-year residency

25

requirement in this case --

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

2

MR. DVORETZKY:

3

The problem is --

-- we would still

prevail.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, except we

5

have a difficulty there, which is you can't

6

look at legislation piecemeal.

7

look at it as a whole.

8
9

You have to

It was written as a whole.

It's one

paragraph that says two years, plus 10.

So

10

it's really 12 years because -- and he said

11

there's no economic justification for a 10-year

12

residency requirement.

13

look at is not whether it's two years but

14

whether there's any reason for a 12-year

15

residency requirement.

16

to 10, then it's no to 12.

17

MR. DVORETZKY:

So what you have to

I mean, if he said no

So, Justice Sotomayor,

18

that -- that gets us into a severability

19

question.

20

And -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But -- but let's

21

go back to my initial question.

Yes, it does.

22

And -- and that's a separate question, and you

23

can argue that one back and forth.

24

But my fundamental question is the --

25

you believe the Twenty-First Amendment permits

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

states to discriminate against out-of-state

2

interests, then does that mean Bacchus,

3

Granholm, all our jurisprudence that has

4

invalidated certain state laws was wrong?

5

that -- are you suggesting we should just

6

disavow all those cases and forget them?

7
8

MR. DVORETZKY:

No.

Is

No, we're not.

And let me address both Bacchus and -- and --

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I know you want to

10

limit it to producers.

But that's not the way

11

that Granholm talked about them, talked about

12

this issue, but --

13

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well --

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- you can slice

15

and dice as much as you want, but is it your

16

position that the Twenty-First Amendment makes

17

all of our other jurisprudence wrong?

18

MR. DVORETZKY:

No, it's not, and --

19

and let me explain how to harmonize it.

20

Granholm -- Granholm mandated a historical

21

test.

22

justices agreed upon, was what were the state's

23

pre-prohibition powers.

24

in Granholm was about whether states could

25

discriminate against out-of-state products

The question in Granholm, which all nine

Now the disagreement

pre-prohibition, but the framework was not an

2

economic protectionism framework; it was a

3

historical question.

4
5
6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But they could

have -JUSTICE ALITO:

Can I come back to the

7

-- what I -- where I thought Justice Sotomayor

8

started, and ask you just very simply, can a

9

state enact a 10-year residency requirement

10
11

and, if not, why not?
MR. DVORETZKY:

There would not be a

12

dormant Commerce Clause problem with a 10-year

13

residency requirement.

14

other constitutional challenge to that, but it

15

would be immune from dormant Commerce Clause

16

scrutiny as long as it treated in-state and

17

out-of-state products the same.

18

There might be some

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Suppose if it

19

was a -- a grandparents requirement.

20

can't -- you can't get a liquor license in

21

Tennessee unless your grandparents were

22

Tennessee residents.

23

dormant Commerce Clause problem?

24

MR. DVORETZKY:

25

So you

That would not create a

It would not create a

dormant Commerce Clause problem because the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

whole point of the Twenty-First Amendment was

2

to constitutionalize the pre-prohibition

3

powers, which included the power to

4

discriminate against out-of-state interests.

5

If you think about the -- the

6

three-tier system and the in-state wholesaler

7

requirement, for example, that this Court in

8

Granholm itself said was unquestionably

9

legitimate, that discriminates against

10

out-of-state interests.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

Just -- I mean,

12

just to understand the contours of your

13

argument, so the -- to pick up on -- on

14

something else Justice Sotomayor referred to,

15

suppose you have a state statute that says for

16

the exclusive purpose of protecting in-state

17

retailers, no -- you must be a resident of the

18

-- of the state for two years, five years, in

19

order to get a license.

20
21
22

Would that be -- would that be
constitutional?
MR. DVORETZKY:

I still don't think

23

there would be a dormant Commerce Clause

24

problem with that.

25

Now, under Bacchus, if you're looking

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

at the language in Bacchus, Bacchus does talk

2

about economic protectionism, but it does so in

3

the context of a case that was discriminating

4

against out-of-state products.

5

If the rule from Bacchus --

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

7

Bacchus -- Bacchus is --

8
9

Wholesalers.

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, it -- it

involved wholesalers, but it involved a tax --

10

it involved a tax exemption that applied only

11

for in-state products rather than out-of-state

12

products.

13
14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, under

your theory --

15
16

And that --

MR. DVORETZKY:

-- the tax was

collected through the wholesalers.

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Yeah, that's the

18

problem.

19

of the dormant Commerce Clause, if the state

20

can do what it wants within its borders because

21

it's regulating liquor, I don't know why our

22

cases would be right under your theory that

23

they can't put a different tax on different

24

products?

25

I don't know why, under your theory

MR. DVORETZKY:

Because, under

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

Granholm and under the history pre-prohibition,

2

states could do virtually what they wanted

3

within their borders but not everything.

4

-- and one important carveout -- and this is

5

reflected in the text of the Wilson Act itself

6

-- is that they had -- had to treat in-state

7

and out-of-state products the same.

8

And

The Wilson Act itself says -- this is

9

in the blue brief at page 26; it's 27 U.S.C.

10

121 -- that states have the power to ban the

11

importation of liquor as long as they treat --

12

in violation of laws in the exercise of its

13

police powers within the state, as long as they

14

are treating liquor to the same extent and in

15

the same manner as those such liquors had been

16

produced in the state or territory.

17

pre-prohibition powers --

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So the

Then Ziffrin --

19

then Ziffrin was wrong?

One of the cases you

20

rely on.

21

counter to Bacchus, wasn't it?

Because Ziffrin was really the

22

MR. DVORETZKY:

Uh --

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And -- and Ziffrin

24

basically said you can discriminate in terms of

25

taxes basically.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

MR. DVORETZKY:

But not based on

2

products.

3

Bacchus was that it was about discrimination

4

based on products.

5

And the -- the key point from

If the rule that came out of Bacchus

6

were just a straight economic protectionism

7

test, Granholm would have been a much easier

8

case.

9

saying the question is, do the Michigan and New

10

York laws at issue -- are they meant to protect

11

in-state producers or not?

12

Granholm could have been written by

That wasn't the analysis that Granholm

13

used.

14

historical test that required the court to look

15

back at the pre-prohibition powers.

16

Instead, again, Granholm set forth this

And the -- the Wilson and Webb-Kenyon

17

Acts, first of all, empowered states to

18

regulate interstate shipment of alcohol so long

19

as they treated in-state and out-of-state

20

alcohol the same.

21

time, pre-prohibition, states also had the

22

inherent authority to regulate in-state sales.

23

So, combined, that meant that states,

And then, second, at that

24

pre-prohibition, were free to structure the

25

in-state liquor distribution systems free from

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

Commerce Clause scrutiny, again, as long as

2

they treated in-state and out-of-state

3

products the same.

4

JUSTICE BREYER:

Does it apply the

5

Commerce Clause?

6

1920, maybe they said you can only be sold on

7

the basis of race or the basis of gender or

8

some -- I mean, it can't be 100 percent

9

whatever they did in 1920.

10

I mean, if you go back to

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, that's right,

11

but that's because the Twenty-First Amendment

12

and the pre-prohibition powers that we're

13

talking about are -- are powers related to

14

overriding the dormant Commerce Clause

15

specifically, not other constitutional

16

provisions like the First Amendment or -- or

17

partially these others.

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

So now, in other

19

words, your position, your view is all the

20

other amendments apply, okay, the Commerce

21

Clause applies too as long as it wasn't part of

22

the distribution system in the Wilson Act.

23

MR. DVORETZKY:

24

JUSTICE BREYER:

25

And -- and that -But, if it's part of

the distribution of the Wilson Act, then it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14

free of Commerce Clause, but, otherwise, it's

2

subject to it, and it's also subject to

3

everything else.

4
5
6
7
8
9

MR. DVORETZKY:

Well, I -- I wouldn't

quite -JUSTICE BREYER:

Is that -- is that

basically -- have I got it basically right?
MR. DVORETZKY:

No.

I -- I wouldn't

quite say we're looking at the distribution

10

system pre the Wilson Act.

11

Webb-Kenyon Acts, which were constitutionalized

12

in the Twenty-First Amendment, were all about

13

permitting states to act in ways that did

14

restrain commerce, but they weren't about

15

permitting states to act in ways that violated

16

the First Amendment or other, you know,

17

individual rights, for example.

18

And so -- and --

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But the Wilson and

So that's where

20

you're wrong because the law then did provide

21

for racial discrimination, and there's nothing

22

in the provision that limits itself to the

23

Commerce Clause.

24
25

It just says:

The transportation or

importation into any state, territory, or

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

possession of the United States for delivery or

2

use therein of intoxicating liquors in

3

violation of the laws thereof is hereby

4

prohibited.

5

I don't actually see in that any

6

reference to the Commerce Clause or to any

7

other limiting principle.

8

that have found limiting principles.

9

MR. DVORETZKY:

Yet we have cases

Yes.

But this Court's

10

cases, including the ones that have found

11

limiting principles, and Granholm itself, all

12

explain that the Twenty-First Amendment has to

13

be understood in light of what it was trying to

14

achieve, which was constitutionalizing these

15

statutes.

16

commerce, notwithstanding their broad language.

17

And these statutes were dealing with

The problem that they were trying to

18

solve and the state powers that they were

19

trying to protect were related to powers

20

because --

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

All right.

Let me

22

-- let me ask something about that.

I do

23

understand that the Twenty-First Amendment was

24

geared towards giving states greater freedom in

25

controlling the distribution and sale of liquor

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

in their jurisdiction.

2

But I'm having a hard time

3

understanding how the residency requirement

4

does when it comes to a person's pre-existing

5

residency.

6

someone there who's responsible to the

7

community is necessary.

8

the three-tier system.

So, yes, we understand that having

That was inherent in

9

But why is it inherent in the

10

three-tier system that you have to have someone

11

who's only a local do it?

12

states whose three-tier system doesn't require

13

that.

They function fairly well.

14
15

There are many

I -- I don't understand the necessity
of that.

16

MR. DVORETZKY:

So, first, I don't

17

think the question is whether it's necessary or

18

not.

19

is the courts aren't supposed to impose that

20

kind of scrutiny.

21

distribution system works within their state.

The point of the Twenty-First Amendment

States get to decide what

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. DVORETZKY:

24
25

Well, we just --

There's no one size

fits all solution.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I -- I agree.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

there are some parts of the discrimination part

2

of the -- of the Commerce Clause that we --

3

today still affect this.

4

You're saying they can't use it to

5

violate the First Amendment.

6

can't use it to discriminate against products,

7

although nothing in here says you can't do

8

that.

9

I'm -- I'm having a hard time

10

understanding.

11

necessary.

12

We've said you

Explain to me why it's

MR. DVORETZKY:

Let -- let -- let me

13

make two points.

14

to your earlier question about the text of the

15

Twenty-First Amendment, the text does refer to

16

the delivery or use of alcohol.

17

that is invoking the sort of Commerce Clause

18

concern that the history confirms.

19

One, just quickly going back

So that --

But, to get to your other question

20

about the purposes of a durational residency

21

requirement, everybody agrees that a residency

22

requirement of some sort is constitutional,

23

notwithstanding that it would otherwise raise

24

Commerce Clause concerns.

25

And the durational component of a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

residency requirement serves very much the same

2

interests.

3

are important because they allow states to

4

conduct background checks.

5

a -- a resident for a longer period of time

6

allows the -- those who decide whether to issue

licenses to actually observe the person and to

observe the person's character and give the --

the state a better ability to decide whether to

12

Likewise -JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, now you're --

you're arguing that they serve a public health

and safety purpose, and -- but I thought you --

15

you answered my previous question by saying it

doesn't matter.

17

of the regulation -- and this is spelled out

18

right in the statute itself -- is economic

authority.

If the only purpose of the --

that's right.

I think there's no historical

pedigree for an economic protectionism sort of

exception.

that, it would essentially be a standardless

inquiry that would --

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I think you're

5

turning -- maybe you're turning it around, and

6

maybe my understanding of history is wrong, so

7

you'll correct me, but I thought that the

8

purpose of the Eighteenth Amendment was a

9

determination by those who adopted it and

10

ratified it that alcohol created a public

11

health and safety problem.

12

And I thought the purpose of the --

13

the -- the Twenty-First Amendment and Section 2

14

of the Twenty-First Amendment was to say this

15

is a determination, the public health and

safety determination is not going to be made on

the states.

have anything to do with economic

protectionism.

It's going to be made by

But none of that seems to me to

But where am I wrong in that?

What is

22

the -- what is the -- the basis for thinking

23

that the purpose of or a purpose of Section 2

24

of the Twenty-First Amendment was to authorize

25

the states in this one area, dealing with

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20

alcohol, to engage in protectionist activities

2

that wouldn't be permitted with respect to any

3

other commodity?

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

I -- I don't think the

5

purpose was specifically to allow protectionist

6

activity.

7

to shield state laws from scrutiny under the

8

dormant Commerce Clause.

9

But I do think that the purpose was

might exercise that authority would be economic

that, as I read it.

You mentioned delivery or use, but it

2

doesn't just say the states have complete

3

authority over delivery or use.

4

about the transportation or importation into

5

any state.

6

It's talking

And why isn't that most naturally read

7

to allow states to remain dry and, therefore,

8

ban transportation or importation, but not to

9

otherwise impose discriminatory or, as Justice

10
11
12
13

Alito says, protectionist regulations?
MR. DVORETZKY:

Two points in response

to that, Justice Kavanaugh.
First, the Twenty-First Amendment has

14

to be read against the backdrop of the inherent

15

authority that states already had to regulate

16

the distribution systems within their system.

17

The Twenty-First Amendment didn't need

18

to say that expressly because it was understood

19

at the time.

20
21
22

Second, this Court in Midcal said -and this is -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Wait.

I'm sorry.

I'm going

23

to stop you there.

Where -- where

24

do you get that -- that idea that it somehow --

25

the backdrop was to give the states authority

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

to enact protectionist legislation or

2

legislation that discriminated against

3

out-of-state producers, retailers, wholesalers?

4

MR. DVORETZKY:

So -- so I direct you

5

to Judge Sutton's dissent in the Sixth Circuit,

6

which walks through the understanding of state

7

authority -- of state authority at that time.

8
9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

I -- I -- I've

gone through all that, and I -- and I don't see

10

that in the Webb-Kenyon Act, that the -- the

11

things that led up to that were not the -- the

12

Act was not, as I understood it, enacted to

13

enable states to enshrine protectionist

14

legislation into state law.

15

MR. DVORETZKY:

Those -- those

16

statutes were enacted in order to avoid

17

circumvention of certain inherent state powers

18

by importing product into the --

19

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

When they wanted

20

to -- when they wanted to remain dry states, as

21

I understood it.

22

MR. DVORETZKY:

But, when the

23

Twenty-First Amendment was enacted, obviously,

24

that was the end of prohibition.

25

restored to the states powers that they

But it also

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

previously had to regulate -- regulate

2

authority within their borders.

3

I'd also direct the Court to Midcal,

4

this is at 445 U.S. at 106, which said that

5

although the Twenty-First Amendment on its face

6

gives the states control over the

7

transportation or importation, such control

8

logically entails considerable regulatory power

9

not strictly limited to importing and

10

transporting alcohol.

11

That too is referring to the Court's

12

-- to the state's inherent power to regulate

13

the systems within their states.

If I may reserve the remainder of my

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID L. FRANKLIN FOR

20

ILLINOIS, ET AL., AS AMICI CURIAE, IN

21

SUPPORT OF THE PETITIONER

22
23
24
25

MR. FRANKLIN:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This Court has repeatedly stated, most
recently in Granholm itself, that Section 2 of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

the Twenty-First Amendment gives states

2

virtually complete control over how to

3

structure their domestic liquor distribution

4

systems.

5

Now questions have obviously arisen

6

already this morning about whether residency

7

requirements were -- were part of that

8

structure.

9

And they were.

We know that, for example, from the

10

Vance case in 1898.

11

discussion there is very instructive.

12

involved the South Carolina dispensary law, but

13

the Court there said the dispensary law was

14

comparable to a situation in which a state

15

required for a retail license that the retailer

16

be a resident of that state.

17

The -- the Court's
Vance

And the Court treated that situation

18

as so self-evidently valid that it used that as

19

the basis for upholding the South Carolina law

20

by saying any rule that would question that --

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

22

MR. FRANKLIN:

-- just couldn't be the

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Franklin, you're

law.

representing quite a number of states,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1
2

including Tennessee, I guess.

Maybe?

These states have very varying

3

residency requirements.

And I want to take you

4

back to Justice Alito's question.

5

appears to be on one end of the spectrum.

6

is there anything in your argument that would

7

give us a way to say, you know, when there's a

8

12-year residency requirement, when there's a

9

100 percent shareholder requirement, these have

Tennessee
And

10

stopped being public health and safety

11

measures; these are clearly protectionist and

12

we should not allow those to occur?

13

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, I agree with my

14

co-counsel that there wouldn't be a dormant

15

Commerce Clause claim there because the

16

Twenty-First Amendment, as he stated, was

17

designed to supplant or displace dormant

18

Commerce Clause analysis.

19

Now there may come a point where the

20

residency requirement is so extreme or so

21

excessive as to be truly arbitrary, and then it

22

could fail the Fourteenth Amendment's

23

background presumption all --

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, it's not

arbitrary if you are intending to promote

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

economic protectionism.

2

your position, it's that that's part of the

3

states' prerogatives too.

4

And as I understand

And then, you know, the sky is the

5

limit.

Every -- the more you do, the more

6

protectionist it gets.

7

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, for example, it's

8

our position in this case that the interplay

9

between the initial two-year residency

10

requirement for a license under Tennessee law

11

and the 10-year renewal requirement, it's hard

12

to see a rational basis for that.

13

like a trap for the unwary.

It seems

14

That -- that's not a dormant Commerce

15

Clause problem, but it could be a violation of

16

the background rationality --

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

18

MR. FRANKLIN:

19

Why --

-- minimal rationality

requirement under the Fourteenth amendment.

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Why is that?

To

21

pick up on Justice Kagan's question, economic

22

protectionism is rational.

23

certain circumstances, it's disputed, but it's

24

rational, and maybe a dormant Commerce Clause

25

problem.

It's -- and in

And you're saying no, it's no dormant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1
2
3
4

Commerce Clause problem.
Then it would seem -- I'm repeating
Justice Kagan now -- the sky is the limit.
MR. FRANKLIN:

My comment went simply

5

to the interplay between --

6

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

7

MR. FRANKLIN:

8
9

I know.

-- the initial

requirement and the subsequent requirement.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Yeah, but the 12

10

years, no dormant Commerce Clause problem, you

11

said, and the rationality argument would be

12

that it's designed to favor in-state retailers.

13

That's rational.

14

MR. FRANKLIN:

Our position would

15

simply be that, at some point down the line,

16

there -- there could be a failure of minimal

17

rationality.

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

19

MR. FRANKLIN:

I guess --

But that's certainly

20

not the case with respect to the two-year

21

requirement that the --

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, General, I

23

guess the question is, if -- if -- if you're

24

conceding that much, what's the delta?

25

the difference between what the dormant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

What's

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

Commerce Clause would otherwise disallow and

2

what I -- I take it to -- to be your position

3

the Equal Protection Clause would -- would

4

permit?

5

If it's -- if it's irrational under

6

one, why is it rational under the other?

7

are we just going to re-create our dormant

8

Commerce Clause jurisprudence elsewhere?

9

MR. FRANKLIN:

And

Well, I do think it

10

would be a mistake to re-create the dormant

11

Commerce Clause elsewhere because --

12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

13

MR. FRANKLIN:

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Presumably.

Right.
But why?

Isn't that

15

exactly the invitation you're issuing us

16

through this concession?

17

MR. FRANKLIN:

I -- I don't think so.

18

All -- all legislation is subject to the

19

Fourteenth Amendment's background requirement

20

of minimal rationality.

21

close to that here.

We don't think we're

22

And the protectionism lens is just the

23

wrong lens through which to look at this issue.

24
25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Suppose you -- law:

Any liquor store has to use paint made in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

Tennessee, asphalt made in Tennessee for the

2

parking lot, neon -- you know, I can go on.

3

(Laughter.)

4

MR. FRANKLIN:

I -- I -- I suppose at

5

some point, if we're talking about the use of

6

paint, then we're really getting pretty far

7

afield from the state's structuring the

8

in-state distribution and sale.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And so there's just

10

as good a reason for saying the out-of-state

11

owner has to be -- live here for 12 years, as

12

there is to say paint.

13

reason because Tennessee paint's really good.

14

(Laughter.)

15

MR. FRANKLIN:

In fact, a better

But this -- the statute

16

here, Your Honor, goes to the question of who

17

can sell to whom and on what terms.

18

always been at the heartland of what the

19

Twenty-First Amendment was meant to protect,

20

the state's ability to structure the intrastate

21

sale of its product.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

That's

I -- I guess,

23

Mr. Franklin, the -- that a question that

24

followed from my last is wouldn't it be a

25

better idea if we said the dormant Commerce

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

Clause does apply, and then let the state come

2

back and say we can meet that test; we have

3

real health and safety concerns here, and our

4

law is well tailored to address those concerns.

5
6

And so it's not a dormant Commerce
Clause violation.

7

MR. FRANKLIN:

I -- I think that

8

approach, which is essentially Judge Sutton's

9

approach, would still embroil the courts in the

10

kind of line drawing that the Twenty-First

11

Amendment was designed to relieve them of by --

12

by creating what this Court has called an

13

exception to the normal operation of the

14

dormant Commerce Clause.

15

with the broad regulatory discretion that's --

16

that's conferred by the Twenty-First Amendment.

17

It would be at odds

But -- but it's -- I think it's

18

important to note also that the Respondents'

19

approach -- which is not that approach, right?

20

Their approach says no discrimination of any

21

kind under the Twenty-First Amendment.

22

And that approach really would leave

23

the Twenty-First Amendment with no meaningful

24

role to play in our modern constitutional

25

order.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

Think about the three-tier system for

2

a moment.

3

not only as unquestionably legitimate but also

4

as involving sales to and purchases from an

5

in-state wholesaler.

6

This Court described it in Granholm

Now that arrangement disadvantages

7

out-of-state business interests.

It wouldn't

8

fly if we were talking about milk or trash.

9

But this Court has treated it as unquestionably

10

legitimate because it's part of the state's

11

choice about how to structure the in-state sale

12

of this particularly dangerous product that has

13

distinctive constitutional treatment under the

14

Twenty-First Amendment.

15

In the end, Respondents are asking

16

this Court to treat alcohol like any other

17

article of commerce.

18

actually 100 years ago today that the

19

Eighteenth Amendment was -- was finally

20

ratified.

21

experiment, the Twenty-First Amendment restored

22

to the individual states their broad police

23

powers over delivery and sale of this product

24

within their borders so long as they treated

25

out-of-state and in-state products the same.

But it's not.

It was

And 14 years after that failed

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And that proviso comes directly from

2

the text of the Wilson Act, which was

3

Congress's instruction as to how and to what

4

extent to overturn this Court's original

5

package doctrine case law from the late 19th

6

Century.

7

no further.

8
9

That was the line Congress drew and

Granholm drew the same line.

It said

we're not going to import all of the dormant

10

Commerce Clause's non-discrimination principles

11

into the Twenty-First Amendment, but we are

12

going to import so much of it as the historical

13

analysis and the Wilson Act require.

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

As Justice Kavanaugh

15

pointed out in an earlier question, the

16

Twenty-First Amendment is about the

17

transportation or importation of alcohol into a

18

state.

19

How do you get from there to a

20

durational residency requirement that is

21

imposed on the owner of a retail outlet in the

22

state?

23

Tennessee and I want a license to operate an

24

entity that will sell only Tennessee whiskey.

25

How would that fall within the terms of the

Suppose I am not a resident of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Twenty-First Amendment?

2

MR. FRANKLIN:

Well, if I can quote

3

from Midcal in the way that my colleague was

4

beginning to do, what the Court said there is

5

very instructive.

6

amendment gives states control over

7

transportation and importation.

8

course, such control -- I'm quoting still --

9

logically entails considerable regulatory power

It said yes, in terms, the

But, of

10

not strictly limited to importing and

11

transporting alcohol.

12

It's true, in other words, that the

13

Twenty-First Amendment speaks of importation,

14

though it also speaks of delivery and use, but

15

it does so --

16

JUSTICE ALITO:

It speaks of

17

transportation for the purpose of delivery or

18

use.

19

MR. FRANKLIN:

For the purpose of

20

protecting the state's ability to control the

21

terms on which delivery or use will take place

22

within its borders.

23

at issue here.

And that's exactly what's

24

The Twenty-First Amendment, in other

25

words, presupposes and safeguards the state's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34

broad control over intrastate distribution and

sale.

And this Court has said that repeatedly.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CARTER G. PHILLIPS

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

Justice, and may it please the Court:

16

Thank you, Mr. Chief

I think I'd like to start with the

17

history because it seems to me that there's a

18

fundamental difference here, and this Court

19

actually has answered the question of what the

20

history of the Wilson Act and the Webb-Kenyon

21

Act and the Twenty-First Amendment was designed

22

to get at.

23

And the language of the Twenty-First

24

Amendment speaks directly to exactly what the

25

purpose of this entire exercise was.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

The problem that the two federal

2

statutes were designed to deal with was the

3

fact that states had complete authority to say

4

we're not going to allow any use or sale of

5

alcohol within our states and had absolutely

6

no authority to stop the import from other

7

states of -- of alcohol.

8
9

In the first instance, in the
original package doctrine, they could sell it

10

to retailers, and then, ultimately, beyond that,

11

they could sell it directly to consumers.

12

the statutes were passed to stop that specific

13

practice.

14

And

And -- and then we go to the

15

prohibition, which, as somebody already noted, is

16

exactly 100 years ago today.

17

back and we repeal the prohibition.

18

language in Section 2 tracks very closely the

19

language and the intention.

20

-- it's not a grant of authority.

21

protection against allowing out-of-state

22

operators to come in and sell directly liquor

23

under certain circumstances.

24
25

And then we come
And the

It's not designed
It's a

That was the entire purpose of it.
that's what the Court held in Bacchus, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

that's what the Court held in -- in Granholm.

2

Bacchus said it was not the -- I'll quote it

3

-- "doubts about the scope of the amendment's

4

authorization, Section 2, notwithstanding, one

5

thing is certain, the central purpose of the

6

provision was not to empower states to favor

7

local liquor industries by erecting barriers to

8

competition."

9

Candidly, I don't know that the

10

Court had to go past Bacchus when it decided

11

Granholm because those statutes were clearly

12

just as economically protectionist as this one

13

is, but the principle from Bacchus is, if a

14

statute has no purpose, and this statute has no

15

purpose except to be protectionist of the local

16

industries, it's unconstitutional.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Is that your standard?

18

Because you seem to slide back and forth a

19

little bit between standards in your brief --

20

or -- or I thought that you did maybe.

21

If -- if a state can come forward with

22

any purpose other than protectionism, the state

23

wins?

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, no.

It's when the

state doesn't come forward with anything except

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

protectionism, the state loses.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

3

comes forward and says:

4

it's protectionist.

Well, suppose a state
We like this because

We were trying to do --

5

MR. PHILLIPS:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Right.
-- some protectionist

7

things.

8

a way that our protectionist interests matched

9

up completely with our health and safety

10

And we also, coincidentally, we found

interests.

11

MR. PHILLIPS:

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.
What happens then?
Then you're in

14

Granholm.

15

mean, Granholm, I think, could have concluded

16

anyway that the statutes involved there were

17

really just economic protectionism and not gone

18

beyond it, but it did go beyond that.

19

And that's -- that's where -- I

And what it said is, if, in fact, the

20

state is engaged in discrimination under the --

21

under normal Commerce Clause standards, it's

22

presumptively unconstitutional, and the state

23

must come forward and justify the

24

discrimination on the basis of

25

non-discriminatory, less restrictive means of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38

2

achieving the same objective.
And under that standard -- and that's

3

-- I'm perfectly comfortable with the standard,

4

because there's no doubt that what we're

5

talking about here is rank discrimination on

6

the basis of commerce.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -- the argument

8

-- look, it also says in Granholm that the

virtually complete control as to how to

it is history.

states, the vast majority, always have had

rules like the Tennessee rule.

count, have rules just like this, except maybe

not the same number of years.

side.

And the history favors the other

So -- so what do we do about that?
MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't think the

5

history does favor the other side, first of

6

all.

7

JUSTICE BREYER:

8

MR. PHILLIPS:

9

Why not?
I -- it's pretty clear

to me there's nowhere near 34 states that have

10

durational residency requirements.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, that may be,

12

but they say you have to be a resident on some

13

form or other.

MR. PHILLIPS:

actually, both of our clients are here to say

19

we -- we -- we are not challenging the

opportunity to compete into this market.

22

All we are seeking is the

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

See, I -- I -- the

23

problem I have is it seems -- I don't think

24

that you would challenge a state -- the state's

25

residency requirement moving forward, meaning

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

that almost all of the states require their

2

wholesalers, distributors, and retailers to be

3

resident in the state.

present; some say resident.

6

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

10

Some say

Present.

But

pretty much you're not challenging that.
MR. PHILLIPS:

I do not challenge that

whatsoever.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So now the

11

challenge seems to me why is a pre-registration

12

or pre-licensing residency requirement of the

13

normal length, one or two years, because I

14

think even the dissent below thought the 14 was

15

too -- the 12 was too long, all right, but

16

let's concentrate on the two.

17

severability your adversary wants.

18

MR. PHILLIPS:

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

20

Let's do the

Right.

Sure.

Why is that two

years not reasonable --

21

MR. PHILLIPS:

Okay.

23

history of what other states have done, et

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

Okay.

So the -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

core principle that's embedded in here, right,

2

is the -- is that there's a non-discrimination

3

principle.

4

residency requirement is, by definition,

5

discriminating against out-of-state interests.

6

And so adopting a durational

And unless you're going to limit it

7

just to producers, which is an irrational

8

limitation this Court's never adopted with

9

respect to any Commerce Clause analysis, we are

10

being discriminated against.

11

it's the state's burden to come forward and to

12

justify that discrimination.

13

And, therefore,

There is no rational basis for the

14

two-year ban that they've put in place here.

15

The Tennessee attorney general himself has

16

twice looked at this ban and said it doesn't

17

remotely serve any purpose that's designed

18

under the Twenty-First Amendment when we're

19

dealing with alcohol or public safety or public

20

health or anything else.

21

exclude us.

22

It's only designed to

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Except for the

23

attorney general may -- may represent the

24

government, but the legislature gave a reason.

25

MR. PHILLIPS:

And -- and the reason

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

it gave was, because this is alcohol, we're

2

protecting the public interest.

3

But that doesn't remotely explain the two-year

4

durational residency requirement.

5

That's fine.

That just explains all of the other

6

regulations that were adopted at the same time,

7

including the 12-year residency requirement.

8
9

So that -- it's their burden, and they
should come forward not just in making

10

statements to the legislature, they can come

11

into court -- and that's what Granholm says.

12

Look, you discriminate against out-of-state

13

interests.

14

to justify the limitation -- the discrimination

15

that it's imposed.

16

this case, it said absolutely nothing.

17

That triggers a burden on the state

In

It didn't -- it didn't file a single

18

affidavit.

19

witness.

20

whatsoever.

21

And what does it say?

It didn't put forward any kind of a
It didn't put on any defense
And the reason is pretty clear.

The sole purpose of this statute was,

22

as my friend here who -- who represents the

23

retailers association proves beyond any

24

question, what this is designed to do is be

25

exclusively protectionist, which is why in some

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

places we say that's a basis for the Court to

2

reach the decision, because this is exclusively

3

protectionist, but, if you don't accept that,

4

our fall-back position is Granholm requires

5

them to come forward with more than they have

6

come forward with.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

MR. PHILLIPS:

10

Let's have --

The same question.
I'm sorry.

JUSTICE BREYER:

That is, yes, of

11

course, but to have -- to be able to have what

12

is called the three-tier system is

13

unquestionably legitimate.

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
Virtually complete

16

control over how to structure liquor

17

distribution.

18

employs people.

19

A liquor distribution system

And how can you structure -- you can,

20

but you could structure a liquor system

21

involving the people who are to work there.

22

The people who are to work there are an

23

integral part of such a system.

24

MR. PHILLIPS:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.
And, therefore, given

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

the case law and the history and the absence of

2

any discrimination forbidden by others, this

3

has been the law for 100 years.

4

it.

Not all law makes that much sense.

5

(Laughter.)

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

7

MR. PHILLIPS:

8
9

Don't change

And there we are.
But this law does make

sense because everything you're talk -JUSTICE BREYER:

I mean, you want to

10

say their -- their law -- you want to say their

11

law does make sense?

12

MR. PHILLIPS:

No.

What I'm saying is

13

that if they can apply the other kinds of -- of

14

restrictions equally to both in-state operators

15

and out-of-state operators, we don't have any

16

problem with that.

17

So, if your question to go back to

18

your hypothetical about paint is if they say:

19

If you're an in-state operator, you've got to

20

-- you have to have green walls, and you're an

21

out-of-state operator you have to have green

22

walls, we have no quarrel with that.

23
24
25

Our concern is that this is a
blatantly discriminatory statute.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And --

Well, Mr. Phillips,

I -- I -- I -- if we were here on a dormant

MR. PHILLIPS:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Thank you, Justice

-- those sorts of

things.

12
13

-- and dealing with

Gorsuch.

10
11

Yeah.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Appreciate the

opportunity.

14

The case that, it seems to me, speaks

15

directly to this really is Walling versus

16

Michigan.

17

predates Webb-Kenyon.

18

categorically that you cannot -- states cannot

19

discriminate against out-of-state sellers by

20

imposing a tax on them.

21

It predates the Wilson Act.

It

It specifically says

And I guarantee you that under the --

22

under the approach offered by my friends on the

23

other side, they read the Twenty-First

24

Amendment to say:

25

tax on them because you're regulating the sale

Of course, you can impose a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

of alcohol, and if you regulate the sale of

2

alcohol on a wholesaler, under those

3

circumstances, you can put a billion-dollar tax

4

on him as long as it's within the Twenty-First

5

Amendment, and that's constitutional.

6

And that predates all of these things.

7

And nothing in the Wilson Act, nothing in the

8

Webb-Kenyon Act, and certainly nothing in the

9

Second Amendment -- Second -- or the

10

Twenty-First Amendment was designed to overrule

11

Walling.

12

And, indeed, this Court said in

13

Granholm, Granholm specifically, that that case

14

and Scott -- and the third case whose name is

15

going to escape me -- Tiernan, all three

16

survived Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment.

17

So while it is true that they can --

18

they can -- they have virtual control --

19

virtually control -- virtual control is

20

something else -- they have the ability to

21

control the structure, that's simply a

22

recognition of the three-tiered system.

23

And just to go back to the history,

24

what's the -- what's the purpose of the

25

three-tiered system?

It's to avoid the tied

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

sales arrangement that gave rise to the

2

prohibition in the first place.

3

You want to have three distinct

4

levels, you know, the -- the producers, the

5

wholesalers, and the retailers.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So that the

MR. PHILLIPS:

They're not

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- the three-tier

11

system does not necessarily, in your view,

entail favoritism of in-state interests?

It probably has some -Doesn't it do

MR. PHILLIPS:

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Because when we're

talking -JUSTICE GORSUCH:

isn't that the next case --

22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Isn't -- isn't --

23

-- the paragraph

that Justice --

MR. PHILLIPS:

I'm sorry?

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

No, I'm sorry.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

The paragraph that

2

Justice Breyer's referred to multiple times

3

also has a quote from a Justice Scalia

4

concurrence which that says the Twenty-First

5

Amendment empowers the state to require that

6

all liquor be sold by an in-state wholesaler.

7

In other words, that is interpreting

8

the three-tiered system, I think, to entail

9

favoritism of in-state interests.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

Right.

But -- but,

11

see, we -- we would regard ourselves as an

12

in-state retailer within the meaning of that.

13

We have satisfied every condition necessary to

14

-- to operate in state, with a presence in

15

state of a very large facility that can be

16

examined, can be determined to be in

17

compliance, can satisfy every single one of the

18

state's vast requirements.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, Mr. Phillips,

20

I'd agree with you on that, but I would think

21

that the next case would be -- much as we've

22

reexamined Quill, for example, and the

23

requirement of physical presence in state, that

24

the next lawsuit would be that, yes, this

25

three-tier system is, in fact, discriminatory

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

by requiring some sort of physical presence in

state.

And under the dormant Commerce Clause

jurisprudence, you have a point.

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, if only because,

under these circumstances, as the camel at

that's not what I'm looking for.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I think you may be,

yes.

13

(Laughter.)

14

MR. PHILLIPS:

I am not -- that's --

15

that's -- you know, it is fundamentally at odds

16

with my client's business model to be looking

17

to undo the three-tier principle.

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But isn't the next

19

business model just to -- to try and operate as

20

the Amazon of -- of liquor?

21
22

MR. PHILLIPS:

No, Amazon wants to

operate --

23

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

MR. PHILLIPS:

Or --

-- as the Amazon of

liquor or may at some point.

No, my client

Heritage Reporting Corporation

operates on a -- on a more -- on a

2

brick-and-mortar business model that says we're

3

perfectly comfortable operating within the

4

sphere of regulation that the state imposes on

5

every in-state operator.

6

seeking to have is not to be discriminated

7

against.

8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:

And all we are

All right.

That's

totally rational to me.

10

MR. PHILLIPS:

I appreciate that.

11

JUSTICE BREYER:

I look at the

12

Webb-Kenyon Act, 1913, and it says you can't

13

send liquor into a state if it's going to be

14

possessed or sold in a -- in any manner used in

15

violation of any law of the state.

16

Now "any," well, maybe we can work

17

with that, but we know at the time that these

18

states did all, or 30 or 20 or 50, have laws

19

that said when you, in fact, structure your

20

distribution system in our state, you have to

21

have local residents.

22

employee requirements.

23

That's one of our

So, when they passed Webb-Kenyon, did

24

they mean all of them except that one?

25

there could have been a lot that were, in fact,

And

violation of dormant Commerce Clause.

2

that's where I'm -- I -- I -- I get all the

3

arguments, but I'm worried about that history.

4

MR. PHILLIPS:

That --

Well, Justice Breyer,

5

you know, I don't know how you can just limit

6

it to that history, though.

7

you go back to the point in time of the -- of

8

Webb-Kenyon, the Court didn't have in mind

9

every state law that happened to be involved

10

with the -- with the distribution of alcohol.

11
12

JUSTICE BREYER:

My guess is, if

No, but there were a

lot that said you have to be a resident.

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Yeah, but there were

14

probably a lot, as you said earlier, that also

15

probably discriminated on the basis of race,

16

discriminated on the basis of ethnicity --

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Those other

18

amendments say they took care of that.

19

they -- they -- all the -- the race, the women

20

and all these different things, they said, no,

21

no, of course, they trump the --

why they trump is because --

MR. PHILLIPS:

-- you can't read under

the laws of the state so broadly as to mean any

Is it permissible for the state to

7

discriminate with a durational residency

8

requirement, not just a presence, but with a

9

durational requirement --

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, to go back to

11

Justice Gorsuch's question, I mean, I'm trying

12

to figure out what kind of opinion we could

13

write, Mr. Phillips, that says you win, but

14

then, when the next case comes along and the

15

next case is somebody that says we don't like

16

this brick-and-mortar stuff, we don't want to

17

have any physical presence at all, and the

18

state is preventing that, and in doing so, the

19

state is discriminating against out-of-state

20

companies.

21

And, you know, you've said that that's

22

not valid, so we're entitled to do what we want

23

to do too.

24
25

MR. PHILLIPS:

I think there are two

ways you can go about this.

The first one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

would be -- I mean, you can write an opinion

2

that just says Bacchus again.

3

is really protectionist and ought to be

4

declared unconstitutional.

5

day the rest of those kinds of issues.

6

This is -- this

Leave for another

The second one is, if you want to take

7

up the question and say, you know, what -- why

8

is -- why is brick-and-mortar more important,

9

well, brick-and-mortar is fully consistent with

10

the three-tier system.

11

another day whether the three-tier system, if

12

it, in fact, operates --

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And we'll leave for

Well, we're leaving a

14

lot of things for another day, but they all

15

seem to be demanded by the principles that

16

you're asking us to adopt.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

Well, I don't think so.

18

All I'm asking -- the principle I'm asking you

19

to adopt is to not discriminate against us

20

under these circumstances where we are clearly

21

exactly identically situated and where the

22

state's interests in -- in protecting against

23

alcohol can be fully protected.

24
25

And leave it for another day if there
are other rules that are challenged to see what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

55
1

those rules are --

4

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I guess what I'm

asking -MR. PHILLIPS:

-- how they operate,

and what's the state's justification for them.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

Because the

7

hypothetical I was attempting to pose is a

8

hypothetical where the state is acting in a

9

discriminatory manner.

And I guess I'm -- what

10

I'm asking you for is, why would some kinds of

11

discrimination be permissible and other kinds

12

of discrimination not be permissible?

13

MR. PHILLIPS:

Because, under certain

14

circumstances, there may not be any less

15

discriminatory way of achieving the state's

16

objective.

17
18

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but, I

mean, are you incorporate --

19

MR. PHILLIPS:

20

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

21

incorporating the dormant Commerce Clause

22

jurisprudence completely?

23

MR. PHILLIPS:

Granholm says that.
-- are you

Well, it's a little

24

tricky because Granholm's a little unclear to

25

me on that because the -- I mean, the normal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

Commerce Clause says if you discriminate, it's

2

-- it's almost per se unconstitutional.

3

Granholm didn't seem to go that far and just

4

talked about narrow tailoring and

5

non-discriminatory means of achieving its

6

objective.

7
8

And I can imagine in a close case it
would make a difference how you deal with that.

9
10

11
12

case.

This is not a close

And -- and, surely, you know, the state

23

can achieve all the regulatory interests it

24

wants to achieve through virtually -- dealing

25

with virtual sellers from out of state, just as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

easily as it can with the physical presence

sellers in state.

This is why we

But what Tennessee has never done here

need all stockholders to be in -- in the town,

21

all the -- all the directors, et cetera.

22

That's the issue before this Court.

23

That seems to me so clearly beyond

what the Twenty-First Amendment was designed to

achieve that the Court simply should declare it

MR. DVORETZKY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

11

Respondents offer no administrable

account of the history.

16
17

First, Respondents concede a residency
requirement.

18

A durational residency requirement

19

follows from that:

20

to define what residency is, and, second,

21

because the same interests that serve a

22

presence requirement also serve a durational --

24

Duration facilitates background

It facilitates investigation and

2

been there for a while is more likely to have

3

substantial assets that can be enforced -- that

4

can be seized, and is less likely to flee at

5

the first sign of trouble.

6

Once you concede that residency

7

requirements are okay, courts shouldn't be

8

second-guessing the extent to which those very

9

same interests are served by durational

10

residency requirements.

11

Twenty-First Amendment was to take that out of

12

the hands of courts.

13

The whole point of the

With respect to the history, Mr.

14

Phillips referred to Walling and to Scott.

15

Both of those were cases like Granholm and

16

Bacchus that involved taxing out-of-state

17

product more heavily than in-state product.

18

That is the exception that Granholm recognized

19

to the state's virtually complete authority.

20

But, when we're talking about purely

21

in-state regulation, like a durational

22

residency requirement for a liquor license,

23

that is what the Twenty-First Amendment is

24

concerned with.

25

There's no economic protectionism test

that is either consistent with the history or

that road, there would be challenges to dozens

If the Court were to go down

And how do we draw a line about

protectionism test, for the reasons given by

17

Judge Sutton in his dissent below, and for the

18

reasons I said earlier, Tennessee's law

19

satisfies the necessary level of scrutiny,

20

which is not a searching sort of strict

21

scrutiny but just is there a plausible reason

22

for the law that makes it survive.

23

Thank you.
