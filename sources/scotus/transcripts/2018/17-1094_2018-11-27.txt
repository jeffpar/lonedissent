CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

argument first this morning in Case 17-1094,

5

Nutraceutical Corporation versus Lambert.

6

Mr. Hueston.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN HUESTON

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. HUESTON:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In the proceedings below, Respondent

12

filed his Rule 23(f) petition months late, and

13

Nutraceutical timely objected.

14

Court has held that mandatory claim processing

15

rules are unalterable when properly invoked,

16

the Ninth Circuit in this case created broad

17

and unprecedented equitable exceptions to

18

excuse Lambert's late filing.

19

Although this

Critically, in this case, this Court

20

has twice considered language in a federal rule

21

that is virtually identical to the federal

22

rules at issue in this case.

23

cases, in the Carlisle and the Robinson cases,

24

this Court rejected equitable exceptions, even

25

when faced with facts far more empathetic than

And in both those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

those presented here.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Counsel, I thought

3

that both sides agreed that if the motion for

4

reconsideration is filed within 14 days, within

5

that period, then there is tolling until the

6

motion is decided.

7
8

Is that -- is that so?

MR. HUESTON:
Ginsburg.

That is correct, Justice

And -­

9

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

10

form of equitable tolling?

And isn't that a

11

MR. HUESTON:

12

equitable tolling, Your Honor.

13

held by this Court in U.S. v. Dieter, it's

14

based on a traditional and virtually

15

unquestioned practice that is premised upon

16

three main policy points:

17

appeals, to develop and strengthen the record,

18

and to respect the authority of the district

19

court.

20

It is not a form of
Instead, as

to prevent premature

It's important to realize that this

21

doctrine could not open the door to equitable

22

exceptions for claim processing rules because,

23

in the Ibarra, Dieter, and Healy cases, those

24

dealt with a statute, 3731, establishing the

25

deadline in a criminal case, and, thus, it was

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

a jurisdictional case.

2

that rule in the context of a criminal case

3

with jurisdictional rules, in fact, tolled

4

those jurisdictional deadlines.

5

therefore, pursuant to the Court's holdings in

6

Hamer and elsewhere, that is not an equitable

7

exception.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So the application of

And so,

Mr. Hueston, given the

reasons that you just stated for that rule, why

10

is the rule limited to a motion for

11

reconsideration that's filed during the 14-day

12

window?

13

In other words, suppose the motion for

14

reconsideration was filed in a timely manner

15

for such a motion but after the 14-day period.

16

Why wouldn't the same reasons apply?

17

MR. HUESTON:

Because, Your Honor, if

18

that reasoning applied, in this instance, for

19

instance, there was actually no deadline for

20

filing of a motion for reconsideration in the

21

Central District of California, but let's

22

assume for purposes of your question we had a

23

30-day deadline.

24
25

If that 30-day deadline were imposed
in this case and one could file on the 30th day

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

and begin tolling, that would render the 14-day

2

deliberately small window that the advisory

3

committee drafters created in order to minimize

4

the disruption and delay in the context of

5

class action cases a nullity because, in any

6

instance where you would have a longer deadline

7

for a motion for reconsideration, you could

8

wait out that period and avoid the window that

9

was intentionally created by the drafters.

10

And I would like to direct the Court's

11

attention specifically to the advisory

12

committee notes to the 1998 amendment to Rule

13

23(f), where they specifically stated the

14

importance of the short window to deliberately

15

keep the time as short as possible.

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It just seems as

17

though the -- the exception that you admit,

18

which is the exception for filing a motion for

19

reconsideration within the 14-day period, also

20

effectively renders that 14-day period a

21

nullity, right, because it stops it in its

22

tracks and then, once the motion for

23

reconsideration has been dealt with, as I

24

understand the agreement between the parties,

25

the -- the clock goes all the way back to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1
2

beginning.
So given that -- that what you -- the

3

exception you admit renders the 14-day period a

4

nullity, again, I just wonder why the exact

5

same reasons, practices, traditions don't

6

suggest that, for example, as in -- as -- as

7

what -- the example you gave, if the motion for

8

reconsideration is timely filed within 30 days,

9

that as long as you do that, it should have the

10
11

same effect.
MR. HUESTON:

Justice Kagan, there is

12

no doubt that if the motion for reconsideration

13

is filed, for instance, on the 14th day, there

14

would then be a longer period of time.

15

must presume that the advisory committee

16

considered that.

17

But we

And as I have thought about the

18

timing, the 14 days creates a shorter window at

19

which then is hooked the potentially later

20

motion for reconsideration period.

21

If we apply Lambert's rule and extend

22

that out to 30 days or potentially longer, and

23

in the Central District no deadline at all, it

24

truly renders the 14-day period a nullity in

25

that instance.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

Your Honors, I would like to direct

2

your attention particularly to the Carlisle

3

case.

4

in former Criminal Rule 45(b).

5

instance, the trial court was faced in a

6

situation where there was a motion for judgment

7

of acquittal and the trial judge found legal

8

innocence.

9

That case involved very similar language
And in that

And the judge granted additional time.

10

The petition was filed just one day late.

11

trial judge found that it was appropriate to

12

grant an extension for just a single day

13

because a grave injustice would occur.

14

The

And yet, faced with legal innocence

15

and excusable neglect, this Court looked at the

16

language of former federal Criminal Rule 45(b),

17

which has virtually identical language to

18

Appellate Rule 26(b), which is applicable in

19

this case; namely, "The Court may not enlarge"

20

-- sorry -- "The Court may not extend the time

21

for the filing."

22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

On that -­

What happens if

24

there's -- what happens if Hurricane Katrina

25

comes along and no one can reach the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

courthouse?
MR. HUESTON:

Your Honor, Hurricane

3

Katrina -- so the answer is, Your Honor, the

4

situation in Carlisle was far more grave than

5

Hurricane Katrina.

6

In that instance -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

In other words, if

7

Hurricane Katrina comes along and all the

8

courthouses are shut, nobody can get there,

9

everybody loses their motion?

10

MR. HUESTON:

Your Honor, in this

11

instance, when you have with Rule 26(f) the

12

emphatic language without the harsh

13

consequences at issue that you do in Carlisle

14

and others, then, if the deadline cannot be

15

abided by within the 14 days, then the

16

opportunity to pursue the petition for

17

permission for interlocutory appeal is lost.

18
19

Now that may seem like a harsh
consequence -­

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

22
23

Well, didn't the -­
I'm not saying harsh

consequence.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

-- same Justice say

24

in Carlisle that it wasn't utterly

25

exception-less, so it may be that Hurricane

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

Katrina would fall into that category?

2

MR. HUESTON:

Well, Your Honor, the

3

language in the plurality opinion is that it

4

was plain and unambiguous, and there was simply

5

no room in the text for even legal innocence to

6

justify a single day's delay.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

How would we -­
But your answer to

Justice Ginsburg's question, I couldn't hear

10

it.

What was it -- but I think it was along

11

the same line.

12

all these things where that courthouse burns

13

down, lightning strikes, Hurricane Katrina?

14

You see the point?

What -- what -- what happens in

15

MR. HUESTON:

Yes.

16

JUSTICE BREYER:

In your opinion, does

17

everybody -- and, you know, there are dozens of

18

motions pending.

19

don't.

20

this language, bad luck, you lose.

21

what it is?

22

jurisdictional rule, it's -- is that -- is that

23

your position?

24
25

Some fall within these.

Some

Anyone with a motion that falls within
Is that

Even though it isn't a

MR. HUESTON:

It is our position

within this context of a mandatory claim

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

processing rule in the emphatic language that

2

is present here, more so than even in the

3

Carlisle and Robinson cases.

4

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Isn't there -­

5

I -- I may be misremembering this, but isn't

6

there a provision that extends the filing

7

period when the courthouse is closed?

8
9
10

MR. HUESTON:

Your Honor, there is an

exception for accessibility of the courthouse
that would apply in that situation.

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now that

12

doesn't help you with intervening periods, I

13

gather that would not toll in that sense, but

14

if the due date is a date on which the court is

15

inaccessible or formally closed, that would get

16

at least that relief?

17

MR. HUESTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

And

18

the key point here, I believe, is that it is

19

properly within the province of the rule

20

drafters to consider when and in what

21

circumstances the court should have discretion.

22

And here, at both Rule 26(b), and

23

then, to distinguish this as an even stronger

24

example of emphatic language, in Rule 2 in both

25

--

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, before we

2

leave -- before we leave 26(b), there is a bit

3

of a complication, right?

4

extend time or permit an act to be done after

5

the time expires.

It says that we can

6

And then what it -- after having given

7

that authority to the court, it then takes away

8

the authority to extend the time to file.

9

doesn't take away both of those things and

10

they're disjunctive.

11

that?

12

MR. HUESTON:

It

So what do we do about

Your Honor, that very

13

issue was addressed in the Robinson case, and

14

that is, with that other issue, can an act be

15

allowed later, the Robinson case found that to

16

allow an act or a filing later would

17

effectively enlarge or extend the period of

18

time, and so, therefore, that would be

19

prohibited.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem with

21

Carlisle and Robinson is that they were well

22

before our explanation of there being a

23

difference between jurisdiction and

24

non-jurisdiction claim processing rules.

25

we were a little bit loose back then in terms

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

of our textual approach to things.

2

MR. HUESTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Justice Gorsuch's

4

question, though, is a fair one because it's

5

the practice of the Supreme Court with respect

6

to filing of amicus briefs that we don't grant

7

extensions but we take late amicus.

8

And so why can't we look at the exact

9

words of 26(b) and say, no, you can't extend

10

the time, but a court has, as it always has,

11

equitable discretion to take something that's

12

filed late because, assuming that the facts

13

qualify as equitable, and that's open to

14

question, I know, in this case, but assuming,

15

why don't we read the provision as it states, a

16

court can permit an act to be done after that

17

time expires?

18

MR. HUESTON:

Justice Sotomayor, let

19

me address -- there were several parts to your

20

question.

Let me try to address each in turn.

21

Undoubtedly, and as this Court has

22

stated repeatedly in recent decisions, that

23

there was a sort of loose use of the term

24

"jurisdictional."

25

loose use of the word "jurisdictional" was, in

However, and, in fact, that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

fact, improperly used in the Robinson case.

2

And that has been pointed out.

3

But the Court in more recent

4

decisions, particularly the Kontrick decision

5

and the Eberhart decision, specifically cites

6

Robinson as still good law, acknowledging,

7

though, the term "jurisdictional" was misused,

8

that, in fact, Robinson stands for, as Eberhart

9

said, observing clear limits of the rules.

10

So going back to the second part of

11

your question, the Robinson case specifically

12

addressed the issue that, well, if the Court

13

has not addressed that second portion, an act

14

that could be allowed, if we allowed a late

15

filing, that would, in fact, eviscerate the

16

first proscription and render, in fact, that

17

portion of Rule 26(b) a nullity.

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So what work does

19

that language then do to permit an act to be

20

done after the deadline?

21

MR. HUESTON:

And I -­

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Why doesn't your

23

interpretation itself render that language a

24

nullity?

25

MR. HUESTON:

And, Justice Gorsuch,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

I've been giving thought to that.

2
3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:
might.

4

(Laughter.)

5

MR. HUESTON:

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

7

(Laughter.)

8

MR. HUESTON:

9

I had hoped you

Thank you.
So have I.

And, Your Honor, I

believe what that may open the door to are

10

other acts that do not effectively enlarge or

11

extend the period of time.

12

other categories of actions that the Court

13

might consider and allow.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So there could be

Give me an example,

15

though, because 26(b) is entitled extension,

16

extending time.

17

it would have had to do something about time.

18

So I would have thought that

And I'm just struggling to come up

19

with an example of what work that language does

20

under your interpretation.

21

MR. HUESTON:

Your Honor, it might,

22

for instance, countenance some other related

23

proceeding or action, other than an extension

24

of time on the actual motion for petition for

25

permission to appeal that would be filed.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

That

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

might be an instance where that would apply.

2

But I -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

I'm sorry, you'll

4

need to explain that to me because I'm not

5

following you.

6

MR. HUESTON:

Your Honor, I think the

7

language in 26(b) as construed by Robinson in

8

this instance would preclude an enlargement of

9

the time to file.

But what another act that

10

might be allowed could be an act that relates

11

to another motion that might be filed in the

12

proceeding or something collateral but not the

13

actual motion itself.

14

If, in fact, we read it to include the

15

motion itself, the Court, and, of court -­

16

course, the Court can revisit the thinking in

17

Robinson, the Court would be moving right into

18

the facts of Robinson and writing out the

19

prescription on the extension of time.

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The problem is

21

that we really wouldn't -- yes, you're right,

22

we would be revisiting Robinson, but we would

23

be saying that the words of a statute have

24

meaning, and Robinson read out of that

25

permission the equitable considerations that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

the very statute permitted.

2

MR. HUESTON:

Your Honor, this case is

3

actually a stronger case with more emphatic

4

language considered collectively than Robinson

5

and Carlisle because we not only have the

6

equivalent of Rule 45(b) and 26(b), we also

7

have Appellate Rule 2, where there is, of

8

course, the notion of equity and suspending the

9

rules.

10
11

And the drafters specifically accepted

the application of 26-2.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That's a -- that's

12

a circle with no out because 2 refers to 26(b),

13

and if we read 26(b) the way I suggest, that

14

already builds in the equitable exception.

15

But, in terms of the purpose of the

16

rule, we have previously said that 26(b) gives

17

-- 26(f) gives the court, the trial court,

18

almost unfettered discretion whether to grant

19

the motion to appeal.

20

wouldn't the natural reading of this be that

21

the court should have unfettered discretion to

22

decide if a late filing makes it think that the

23

issue is more important than it might otherwise

24

have thought?

25

And if that's the case,

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It's the discretion

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

of the court of appeals, not the district

2

court.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

5

Yes.
To give permission

to appeal.

6

MR. HUESTON:

Justice Sotomayor, to

7

answer your question, the court of appeals has

8

discretion to accept a timely petition but does

9

not have the discretion to accept an untimely

10

petition because the rule-makers specifically

11

removed that discretion in the language of

12

26(b) and 2, and there's one other rule that's

13

applicable, and that is Appellate Rule 5(a)(2),

14

which further reinforces that a petition must

15

be filed within 14 days.

16

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And Rule 26(b), it

17

says generally the court may grant an extension

18

of time.

19

which it can't, and that is for permission to

20

appeal, the time to appeal or the time to seek

21

permission to appeal.

22

MR. HUESTON:

23

But there's a category of cases in

Yes.

Yes, Justice

Ginsburg, but that supports our point.

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

MR. HUESTON:

Yes, it does.

Because, in that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

instance, we can clearly see the intent of the

2

rule-makers in providing for a broad range of

3

equitable discretion and then withdrawing it in

4

the particular instance of 26(b).

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

What do you think in

6

-- I think it was Justice Ginsburg's

7

concurrence in Carlisle, where she said that

8

the Court had recognized one "sharply honed

9

equitable exception" -- it doesn't have the

10

word "equitable," but it means it -- "to

11

mandatory claim processing rules."

12

circumstances exception.

13

MR. HUESTON:

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15
16

The unique

Your Honor -­
Is that -- do you

agree with that?
MR. HUESTON:

-- I agree that Justice

17

Ginsburg filed a concurring opinion and

18

described -­

19

(Laughter.)

20

MR. HUESTON:

-- the unique

21

circumstances doctrine as, indeed, a sharply

22

honed exception that covers cases in which the

23

trial judge misled a party who could have and

24

probably would have taken timely action had the

25

trial judge conveyed correct, rather than

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

incorrect, information.

2

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I believe the

3

example was the trial judge, you have until X

4

date to file, and the litigant filed on X date,

5

but, in fact, the judge was wrong and it should

6

have been an earlier date.

7

MR. HUESTON:

That's right.

When

8

there is a specific assurance by the trial

9

judge and a mistaken one that the party

10

reasonably relies on to its detriment,

11

factually, that simply does not apply here, and

12

this Court need not reach the applicability of

13

the unique circumstances doctrine.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

But that's -- that's

15

different.

16

take it you agree that there is one sharply

17

honed exception, whatever that might be, called

18

emphatic language, whether that might preclude

just saying in general -­

22

MR. HUESTON:

Yes.

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

-- with claim

processing rules, there are equitable

25

exceptions.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. HUESTON:

Yes, Your Honor.

2

JUSTICE BREYER:

At least for unique

3

circumstances.

4

That's what you're about -- you could argue

5

that or you could say never.

6

what you think is correct.

7

And then this is not one.

MR. HUESTON:

And I'm not sure

Your Honor, I am arguing

8

in this case that the Court need not reach the

9

application of the unique circumstances

10

doctrine, and, factually, if we attempt to

11

apply it, it does not apply here.

tolling, and unique circumstances is a species

2

of equitable tolling?

3

your argument?

4

MR. HUESTON:

Doesn't that have to be

Your Honor, doctrinally,

5

that is our argument, that when you have

6

language as we do at issue here, emphatic and

7

mandatory, it precludes the reading of all

8

equitable exceptions.

9
10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

can't please everyone here.

11

(Laughter.)

12

MR. HUESTON:

13

Well, Mr. Hueston, you

I'm trying my best, Your

Honor.

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I think you're going

15

to have to choose between nothing, no time,

16

never, and, sure, you can reserve some -- the

17

possibility of an equitable exception in

18

circumstances that are different from the ones

19

here.

So which is it?

20

MR. HUESTON:

Your Honor, again, we

21

don't believe the Court needs to reach the

22

application of the unique circumstances

23

doctrine.

24

sharply honed exception recognized to apply

25

within the context of claim processing rules,

And if that's the only one, the one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

and it factually does not apply, then the

2

decision below must be reversed.

3

But, to answer your question, I do

4

believe that the language here is sufficiently

5

emphatic and clear that it does not admit to

6

equitable exceptions.

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

I mean, it's not clear

8

that you face this binary choice.

9

with unique circumstances, a potential problem,

The problem

10

is that every lawyer who is in trouble thinks

11

that the circumstances of that lawyer's case

12

are unique and every judge who wants to get to

13

a particular result can characterize the facts

14

of the case before the judge as unique.

15

maybe there's such a thing as the catastrophic

16

exception or the apocalyptic exception.

17

(Laughter.)

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

But

So, if there's a

19

Martian invasion, there would be an exception

20

for that.

21

know, like the attorney is sick, wouldn't work.

22
23
24
25

But something short of that, you

MR. HUESTON:

That's right, Your

Honor.
JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, it's rather

hard to -- what is -- what is the answer to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

what Justice Alito says?

2

as the Chief Justice points out, where the

3

courthouse is closed, but one can think of

4

epidemics or fires in the north -- and, you

5

know, that's exactly right -- and what -- what

6

do we write about that?

7

do we write?

8

from the courthouse, which is open.

9

what do we write?

10

We have the answer,

What, in your opinion,

A forest fire keeps the lawyer

MR. HUESTON:

All right.

What -­

So, in that

11

instance, within the context of this case, Rule

12

23(f), the court, in fact, would not be allowed

13

to admit an equitable exception in that

14

circumstance.

15

not, and the drafters, I submit, had this in

16

mind.

17

That appears harsh, but it is

A Rule 23(f) petition for permission

18

to seek interlocutory appeal, if that cannot

19

proceed, they have their full right of appeal

20

at the end of the case.

21

harsh consequence ensues.

22

No catastrophic or
And so -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, that's going

23

to be too late in the real world of how the

24

litigation transpires, though, you would admit?

25

Too -- too late as a practical matter.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

MR. HUESTON:

Well, in the -- Justice

2

Kavanaugh, in the context of class action

3

cases, typically -- and, of course, the rules

4

allow this -- you can continue to challenge the

5

class certification or decertification order.

6

So, practically, there is no

7

catastrophic lost ability.

And having that

8

fully retained appellate right puts the

9

Petitioner in a far better circumstance than

10

the party in Carlisle, who was faced with a

11

plain error review on appeal, or a habeas

12

route, one of the most difficult pathways in

13

the law.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Would it be fair to

15

say that your position is not necessarily never

16

but not more than hardly ever?

17

(Laughter.)

18

MR. HUESTON:

19

Your Honor.

20

last -­

21

Repeat the question,

More than hardly?

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I missed the

Yes.

In other

22

words, we can say never, and that's one answer;

23

another is equitable discretion without any

24

tight boundaries, and another is what -- what

25

my opinion in Carlisle -- Carlisle referred to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

as sharply honed, not utterly exception-less.

2

So it's not never, but hardly ever.

3

MR. HUESTON:

That could be the

4

pathway, obviously, the Court does take.

5

one sharply honed exception, as Your Honor

6

described in your concurrence, was the hardly

7

ever one exception that the Court was

8

describing.

9
10

12

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:
MR. HUESTON:

And

What -- what -­

Here, it factually does

not apply.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Picking up on

13

Justice Kagan's question at the beginning, is

14

the exception for a motion for reconsideration

15

that's filed within 14 days, is that equitable,

16

or what is that exception?

17
18
19

MR. HUESTON:

No, it is not an

equitable exception, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

20

written in the rules.

21

MR. HUESTON:

Well, it's not

It is based -- according

22

to U.S. v. Dieter, it is not written in the

23

rules, but it is instead based on -­

24

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

25

If it's not

written in the rules, doesn't it have to be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

characterized as equitable?

2

understanding where that comes from, and -- and

3

I'm also not understanding what sense that

4

makes, really, because, if you filed a timely

5

motion for reconsideration, you have filed a

6

timely motion for reconsideration.

7

shouldn't be circumscribed based on some other

8

rule that has nothing to do with motions for

9

reconsideration.

10
11

I'm still not

It

What's wrong with that

thinking?
MR. HUESTON:

What's -- what's wrong

12

with that, Your Honor, is that it departs, and

13

the Court can revisit, the teaching of Healy

14

that, to keep the appellate right alive, the

15

motion for reconsideration has to be filed

16

within the applicable time, in this case 14

17

days, and that has been the rule that has

18

applied here.

19

And motions for reconsideration have

20

not been described as equitable exceptions.

21

And, again, the point I made earlier that they

22

have been applied to delay in the context of

23

the application of jurisdictional rules shows

24

that they are not regarded by this Court

25

historically as equitable in nature.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN A. HERSTOFF

7

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

8
9

MR. HERSTOFF:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

10

For three main reasons, the court of

11

appeals properly decided to consider this

12

appeal on the merits.

13
14

First, the appeal was timely within
the plain language of the federal rules.

15

Second, the court of appeals properly

16

determined that Rule 23(f) is subject to

17

equitable tolling.

18

And, third, the appeal was properly

19

considered based upon this Court's decisions in

20

Harris Truck Lines and Thompson.

21

to start with timeliness under the federal

22

rules.

23

And I'd like

Rule 59(e) provides that a motion to

24

alter or amend the judgment may be filed within

25

28 days.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Rule 59(e) deals

2

with final judgment at the end of the case, the

3

final judgment on the merits.

4

with interlocutory rulings.

5

every ruling in the case into a judgment

6

covered by Rule 59.

7

case, the final judgment.

8
9

It doesn't deal
You can't turn

59 is at the end of the

MR. HERSTOFF:

I submit that the -­

the language of Rule 59(e) refers to judgments,

10

which are defined as orders from which an

11

appeal lies under Rule -­

12

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yes, but -- but

13

those words, an order from which the appeal -­

14

an appeal lies, means an appeal as of right.

15

And the one thing I think we can all agree on

16

here is permission to appeal the grant or

17

denial of class action is not an appeal of

18

right.

19

MR. HERSTOFF:

And I agree with that.

20

It is a permissive appeal.

21

of appeals grants permission to appeal, the

22

appeal does lie from that certification order.

23

But even if the Court finds that the -­

24
25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But once the court

You read -- just

to clarify, you read -- you read Rule 54 to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31

2

apply to appeals not just as of right?
MR. HERSTOFF:

That's right, Justice

3

Kavanaugh, I do.

4

Petitioner said that an appeal does not lie

5

because it is not an appeal as of right, but

6

Black's Law Dictionary defines "lie" as to

7

exist or to reside.

8
9

And in the yellow brief, the

And once the -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But in the context

of 59(a) -- 54(a), it is an appeal of right.

10

If you segment out one party and a judgment is

11

finalized to that party or a particular claim,

12

the judgment can be made final as to that claim

13

even though other claims are pending.

14

thought that's what 54 deals with.

15

MR. HERSTOFF:

I

Well, Rule 54(b) does

16

permit a district court to enter final judgment

17

with respect to certain claims.

18

for that, that is a final judgment as of right

19

once the district court certifies that for -­

20

for appeal.

21

And for -- and

But even if this were not a Rule 59

22

motion, the -- this appeal still was timely for

23

several reasons.

24
25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Can I just ask on

the Rule 59 question, again, suppose a local

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

rule gave you 45 days for a motion for

2

reconsideration, but Rule 59 has the 28-day.

3

What's your position on that?

4

MR. HERSTOFF:

If -- if Rule 59 were

5

determined to apply here, then that would not

6

work because Rule 59 has a non-extendable

7

28-day period.

8
9

If it is not a Rule 59 motion, though,
I think in -- in your example there would be a

10

local rule that gives -- I think you said 45

11

days, that would be a timely reconsideration

12

motion.

13

JUSTICE ALITO:

14

why would that even be permitted?

15
16

MR. HERSTOFF:

Why would that be -­

Why -- why would it be

permitted to -­

17

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah.

Why would that

18

-- why would the filing of a motion for

19

reconsideration, which is nowhere mentioned in

20

the Rules of Civil Procedure, toll the time for

21

filing an appeal?

22

MR. HERSTOFF:

Because, there, this

23

Court has long held that a timely

24

reconsideration motion will suspend the time to

25

appeal.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

And in the Dieter, Healy, and Ibarra

2

line of cases, those dealt with the criminal

3

rules, where there is no specific provision for

4

reconsideration motions.

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it might be that

6

-- that filing it within the period allowed

7

under the particular rule at issue here would

8

toll the time to appeal, but I don't see where

9

anything -- I'm not sure the basis for the idea

10

that filing a motion -- forget about Rule 23

11

for the moment -- filing a motion for

12

reconsideration, so-called, tolls the time to

13

appeal.

14

As I said, there's no mention of that

15

in the Rules of Civil Procedure.

16

of Appellate Procedure set out quite clearly

17

the particular motions that toll the time for

18

filing a notice of appeal, and there's no

19

mention there of a motion for reconsideration.

20

There's a motion -- it mentions the motion to

21

alter or amend the judgment.

22

MR. HERSTOFF:

And the Rules

Well, I think the -­

23

this Court's decision in Ibarra explains this

24

well.

25

that reconsideration motions toll the time to

And the Court explained that the reason

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

appeal is to give the district court an

2

opportunity to correct their own alleged errors

3

and to prevent unnecessary burdens from being

4

placed on the court of appeals.

5

I think that's -- that's shown here,

6

where you have a record on the class

7

8

with the record.

9

specifically said only 10 days after the

12

And during that time, the court agreed

13

to suspend summary judgment proceedings, other

14

pretrial proceedings, and trial.

15

considerable pause in the proceedings so that

16

the district court would have a chance to

17

reconsider before the case went up on appeal.

18

And that -- I think that makes a lot

So this was a

of sense.

20

discouraged from reconsidering before it goes

up to the court of appeals.

22

And I think the courts should not be

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But there's nothing

23

inconsistent with the 14-day limit of seeking

24

permission to appeal and making a motion to

25

reconsider.

You could do both.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

MR. HERSTOFF:

It's true that you

2

could do both, but then you'd have the district

3

court and the court of appeals considering the

4

exact same order at the same time.

5

Court has long held that the district courts

6

and the courts of appeals should not be -­

7

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And this

Well, the court of

8

appeals says we'll wait -- we'll wait on the

9

district court's decision on the motion for

10
11

reconsideration.
MR. HERSTOFF:

The court of appeals

12

would have the discretion to stay their

13

proceedings, just like district courts have

14

discretion to stay their proceedings.

15

But -- but, still, you'd have the same

16

on the order that's up at both the court of

17

appeals and at the district court.

18

And I think it makes more sense to say

19

that when the reconsideration motion is pending

20

at the district court, there should be no need

21

to file a petition for permission to appeal.

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

understand the district court to be saying when

it set the motion for reconsideration?

to reconsider this decertification order and,

9

indeed, they suspended, the district court

10

suspended further proceedings.

11

12

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So the case was

The district court,

not specifically say that.

But we were -­

I'm sorry.
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

In the cases that

said mandatory, Kontrick, Eberhart, it said

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38

strictly applied, but the party who would

2

benefit from the rule can waive the rule or

3

forfeit it, but -- but both cases said, if it's

4

properly raised, as it was here, then it

5

applies.

6

MR. HERSTOFF:

That's true.

But

7

Kontrick also left open the possibility that

8

these rules could be softened on equitable

9

grounds, I think was the language that was used

10

in Kontrick.

11

I'm sorry.

12

And it makes sense.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

And this -­

I'm just

13

trying to figure out.

14

of tighten up the use -- loose use of the term

15

"jurisdiction," we -- we said that these are,

16

nonetheless, mandatory.

17

I mean, when we did sort

And for some of us at least, that made

18

sense.

But if it -- if the alternative to a

19

stricter application of the jurisdictional term

20

was that equitable claims are going to be

21

available across the board, I for one would

22

want to reconsider our loosening of the use of

23

"jurisdiction" because there ought to be some

24

area, I thought, where the claims -- where the

25

claim procedures were -- were mandatory in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

sense that Justice Ginsburg has just talked

2

about.

3

MR. HERSTOFF:

So I -- I -- I don't

4

think the claim processing rules are

5

necessarily subject to any equitable exception.

6

It's not necessarily subject to good cause

7

exceptions or excusable neglect like -- like

8

most softer deadlines would be.

9

Equitable tolling is different,

10

though.

11

American jurisprudence since the beginning and

12

even in England prior to that.

13

Equitable tolling has been a part of

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, yes, at

14

a time where "jurisdiction" meant what we used

15

to think it meant.

16

was equitable tolling but not across the board,

17

and the areas in which it did not apply were

18

much more expansive than they are now today.

19

In other words, yes, there

MR. HERSTOFF:

I think, back then when

20

equitable tolling did not apply, that those

21

were in circumstances, from my understanding,

22

where the time limit is what the Court today

23

would refer to as jurisdictional.

24

we have a non-jurisdictional provision.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Now, here,

Is -- is the upshot

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

of your argument, though, counsel, that so long

2

as it's a non-jurisdictional rule, equitable

MR. HERSTOFF:
position.

7

Congress couldn't

No, that is not our

We do not go that far.
JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Okay.

So if -- if

8

there is room for what the Chief Justice

9

suggests remains, why isn't this the paradigm

10

case?

11

through the rule-making committee have been?

12

In multiple places, in multiple ways making

13

clear through language like "must" and

14

expressly excluding times for appeal, I mean,

15

gosh, if this isn't good enough, what is?

16

I mean, how -- how clear could Congress

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, I think that -­

17

that as Your Honor referred to with my -- with

18

my co-counsel, Rule 26(b) specifically draws a

19

distinction between extending the time, on the

20

one hand, and, on the other hand, permitting a

21

late filing.

22

And here, if anything -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, we have

23

Robinson that takes care of that problem, he

24

says, so we have precedent there.

25

how -- how much clearer could the rules have

So, again,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

been but for maybe that one example, the

2

precedent plugs that hole?

3

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, I think the -­

4

the rules committee actually was a lot clearer

5

in another example where I think the rule would

6

not be subject to equitable exceptions, and

7

that's in Appellate Rule 4(a)(4), specifically

8

the 2016 amendment to 4(a)(4).

9

There, the Court changed the rule to

10

make clear that only a timely Rule 50 or Rule

11

59 motion, and it's not an untimely Rule 50 or

12

Rule 59 motion, would suspend the time to

13

appeal regardless of what the district court -­

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

15

think as a standard we should use?

16

say, if it's a jurisdictional rule, I guess

17

that's pretty unwaivable and nothing.

18

a non-jurisdictional rule, then equitable

19

grounds, but, certainly, Congress can stop

20

that, or the rules committee.

21

stopped it was it said, normally, you can

22

extend the time for good cause.

23

Well, what do you
That is to

If it's

And the way it

Now that's quite broad.

But there's

24

an exception for our case, which says you can't

25

extend it for good cause.

So here we have for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

good cause, here we have zero, and I thought

2

perhaps that Justice Ginsburg proposed a narrow

3

exception that would, in fact, make it not for

4

good cause but not zero.

5

circumstances sharply honed, which I guess

6

covers Justice Alito's Mars attack -­

7

(Laughter.)

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

And that's the unique

9
10
11
12

-- and various others

that are unusual but cry out, okay?
Now what about that?
advocating it.

I'm not

I want to know your opinion.

MR. HERSTOFF:

I -- I agree

13

completely, Justice Breyer, with -- with what

14

you're saying.

15

extension is not permitted for petitions for

16

permission to appeal.

17

It is true that a good cause

Rule 26 does not say anything about

18

equitable tolling.

Equitable tolling requires

19

much more than simple good cause.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

21

at sharply honed, special, unique

22

circumstances, how do you win this case?

23

Because what seemed to happen here is it was -­

24

I don't know if it was you, but whatever lawyer

25

went in for your side, within the 14 days, did

If, in fact, we are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

not even ask the judge to extend the time, at

2

least not in writing.

3

to say you are, from an equitable point of

4

view, in a unique circumstance.

5

MR. HERSTOFF:

And so it's pretty hard

Well, I do think that

6

the -- the Thompson rule applies here, because

7

10 days after the decertification order, the

8

district court held a status conference during

9

-- during which we asked for permission to file

10

a motion for reconsideration in writing.

11

at that time -­

12

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And

Counsel, on what

13

ground would we overrule the circuit's

14

rejection of that argument?

15

below.

It explicitly didn't rule on that

16

basis.

It held that you had filed the motion

17

after the 14 days.

18

disagree with the circuit court on that?

19

You raised it

What ground do we have to

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, you're talking

20

about with the Ninth Circuit saying -- saying

21

that unless an exception applies, the petition

22

would be barred?

23

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

24

MR. HERSTOFF:

25

Exactly.

So the -- when the

Ninth Circuit said that, it included within

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

that language a reconsideration motion that's

2

filed within the 14 days.

3

appeals said was that the decertification order

4

was made on February 20.

5

23(f) petition filed within that 14-day period.

6

And, therefore, unless an exception applies, it

7

would be untimely.

8
9

So what the court of

There was no Rule

So the court was saying, even if a
motion for reconsideration was filed within the

10

14-day period, it would be untimely.

So they

11

considered that an exception as well.

So -­

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

The -- the

13

unique -- we've talked about unique

14

circumstances.

15

one.

16

have been many fires, there hasn't been a

17

Martian invasion yet, but what do you think it

18

is?

19

Unique is defined as the only

There have been many hurricanes, there

Unique is not unusual, right?
So, if you're going to create an

20

exception for unique circumstances, it can't

21

mean the situation where judges misadvise

22

litigants about how much time they have.

23

doesn't happen all the time, but we've

24

certainly seen more than one case of that.

25

So, if you're going to say unique

Heritage Reporting Corporation

That

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

circumstances, what exactly does it mean, if it

2

doesn't mean what the dictionary says?

3

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, I think it -- it

4

is a unique circumstance where the district

5

court misadvises the party on how much time -­

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I mean, I've

7

seen dozens of cases where that has happened.

8

In some, if it's an equitable tolling

9

situation, it's typical that equitable tolling

10

is appropriate, although not always.

11

not unique.

12

So that's

Now, if you're going to say it's an

13

unusual circumstance, then I think you've

14

opened the barn door.

15

it's a circumstance where the judge is the main

16

villain in the missing of the deadline, well,

17

then that's something else, and maybe that's

18

better or -- or worse than unusual.

19

just seems to me that if you're -- you're using

20

"unique" -- perhaps the Court has used "unique"

21

as kind of a wiggle word that shouldn't have

22

any wiggle in it.

23

MR. HERSTOFF:

If you're going to say

But it

Well, I think that

24

applying this doctrine is consistent with the

25

federal rules, though, for instance, on Rule 1,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

and the rules are derived from the old equity

2

rules, so it makes sense that there is some

3

flexibility there when a district court

4

misinforms litigants about the time that they

5

have to file, especially in the context of a

6

non-jurisdictional rule like we have -­

7

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, then I

8

think you do have to say the exception is when

9

the district court misadvises the litigants,

10

rather than saying "unique" but not really

11

meaning unique, because then you get in a

12

situation that Justice Alito was talking about.

13

Most lawyers consider their case unique when

14

they run into something like this, and the

15

judges gives them a lot more flexibility than

16

perhaps the rules committee wanted as well.

17

MR. HERSTOFF:

I agree.

I mean, I

18

think this term "unique circumstances doctrine"

19

does refer specifically to the district court

20

misinforming it -­

21

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yeah, Mr. Herstoff, I

22

don't think this is your fault, right?

23

the court's fault in -- in putting a bad label

24

on something that it actually meant when it

25

meant -- meant something else.

But my

Heritage Reporting Corporation

This is

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

understanding of what the court has meant when

2

it's done this is not the attack from Mars or

3

Hurricane Katrina.

4

My understanding is that it was meant

5

to label a category of cases where the court

6

had misled the party into doing something, into

7

missing some kind of deadline.

8

understanding?

9
10
11
12
13

MR. HERSTOFF:

Is that your

Yes, I agree, Justice

Kagan.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So -- but -- but I

don't see where that is here.
MR. HERSTOFF:

Where that is?

Well,

14

the district court paused the proceedings and

15

specifically said that you -- that a

16

reconsideration motion could be filed by

17

March 12, 2015.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.

So he said a

19

reconsideration motion could be filed.

20

right about that.

21

could have been filed.

He was

A reconsideration motion

22

What he didn't say anything about

23

was -- was -- was what that meant for your

24

appeal right.

25

MR. HERSTOFF:

That's true.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But I

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

think there is a basic understanding that when

2

a reconsideration motion is pending, a party

3

does not need to seek appellate review on top

4

of that.

5

I mean, that's really what happened in

6

Thompson.

The district court did not say

7

anything about an appeal.

8

the motion was filed in ample time.

9

Court held that that was -- that was

It simply said that
And the

10

sufficiently misleading such that the appeal

11

was required to be considered on the merits,

12

even though -­

13

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

14

any doubt on Thompson?

15

MR. HERSTOFF:

Has this Court cast

In the -- in the

16

context of jurisdictional rules, yes, the Court

17

overruled Thompson for jurisdictional deadlines

18

and this Court's decision in Bowles but left it

19

intact for non-jurisdictional rules.

20

And I think with good reason, because

21

non-jurisdictional rules, I think, presumably

22

should be subject to or at least presumptively

23

subject to equitable considerations, such as

24

tolling, such as the -- what the Court has

25

referred to as the unique circumstances

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

doctrine, which I think is a subspecies of

2

tolling or estoppel.

3

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well -­

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought mandatory

5

-- the Court has said in -- in the Kontrick

6

line of cases mandatory means inflexible?

7

MR. HERSTOFF:

And that, I mean,

8

generally is inflexible.

9

advocating for a good cause standard here.

10

I mean, we're not

There has to be something more than that.

11

I think that a district court

12

misleading a party is more than simple

13

excusable neglect or good cause.

14

tolling is as well.

15

decision in Irwin, the Court said that statutes

16

of limitations are presumptively entitled to

17

equitable tolling and then went on to hold that

18

in the facts of that case, equitable tolling

19

was not established because the party -­

Equitable

I mean, in this Court's

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

21

MR. HERSTOFF:

Counsel -­

-- had established at

22

most a garden variety claim of excusable

23

neglect, so I think tolling is on a different

24

level.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- I -- I think -- I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

think you have two possible lines of response

2

to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I'm curious

3

which you choose.

4

So, if Thompson doesn't apply to

5

jurisdictional statutes, one could say it does

6

apply to mandatory but inflexible claims

7

processing rules because it's not a species of

8

equitable tolling at all; it is, in fact, a

9

rule of judicial administration that, when it's

10

our fault, shame on us.

11

Or one could say, yeah, let's be

12

honest, it's a form of equitable tolling and,

13

therefore, shouldn't apply, just as it doesn't

14

to jurisdictional rules, it shouldn't apply to

15

mandatory claims processing rules, but should

16

remain a viable option otherwise.

17

would harmonize Bowles with this line of cases.

18
19
20

And that

Which of those choices should we make
and why?
MR. HERSTOFF:

I do think that -- that

21

these rules presumably should be subject to

22

equitable tolling and not necessarily just for

23

the district court misleading the parties.

24

However, either way, the judgment should be

25

affirmed because here, in fact, the -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

court did mislead Mr. Lambert into thinking

2

that he had -­

3
4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How?

The court

didn't say one word about permission to appeal.

5

MR. HERSTOFF:

The court didn't, but I

6

think this is just like Thompson, where the -­

7

where the court said you had this amount of

8

time to seek reconsideration.

9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Don't the local

10

rules of many courts then miss -- also mislead

11

counsel because the local rules of many courts

12

would have motions for reconsideration that

13

could be filed within periods longer than 14

14

days?

15
16

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, then I think that

-­

17

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Under your

18

position, all the district court did here was

19

identify a date that was longer than 14 days.

20

The local rule for motions for reconsideration,

21

the local rules of many courts similarly

22

identify a date that's longer than 14 days for

23

motions for reconsideration.

24
25

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, I think on that

--

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

How would you

2

distinguish what happened here from a local

3

rule that's longer than 14 days?

4

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, I think here the

5

district court did set this -- this specific

6

deadline.

7

And I think it does -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

How would you

8

distinguish a local rule that has a date longer

9

than 14 days, a period longer than 14 days in

10

which you can file a motion for

11

reconsideration?

12

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, I do think that

13

-- that really Rule 59 comes into play here,

14

which says 28 days, but I think it is very

15

unreasonable to interpret Rule 59 to apply

16

here, but even if the Court concludes that it

17

does not, it's at least a reasonable

18

interpretation to say -­

19

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And the Rule 59

20

argument, just to reiterate, depends on your

21

Rule 54 interpretation, correct?

22

MR. HERSTOFF:

That's right, yes.

So

23

I -- I do think that at -- at the very least,

24

if a local rule gives up to a 28-day period to

25

seek reconsideration.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You could have the

2

same confusion of a local rule that gives

3

longer than 28 days, for example, the local

4

rule here for motion for reconsideration, but

5

then you're not within the 28 days of Rule 59,

6

right?

7

MR. HERSTOFF:

I think that's true.

8

The Court has not really had occasion to

9

address the precise contours of when a motion

10

for reconsideration is going to suspend the

11

time to appeal.

12

decided that have been in the context where the

13

reconsideration motion was filed within the

14

time to appeal.

15

consider it when the -- when it's been filed

16

outside, say, this 14-day time period.

17
18

The Court's cases that have

So it hasn't had occasion to

So that clarification is important
here to -- to consider that.

19

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

What do you do

20

with a local rule that has no time limit, as

21

the one here in a motion for reconsideration, a

22

motion is filed a year later or something like

23

that?

24
25

MR. HERSTOFF:

I think, under those

circumstances, it becomes a question of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

reasonableness.

Now if upon -- if the

2

litigation goes on and a year later you're

3

asking the court to reconsider its decision

4

based upon the exact same evidence that was

5

before the court a year earlier, I think that,

6

as an initial matter, the Rule 23(f) petition

7

is very unlikely to be granted because the

8

court of appeals is going to see that as

9

causing an unreasonable delay.

10

And as was discussed earlier in this

11

argument, the courts of appeals have absolute

12

discretion whether to consider this appeal or

13

not.

14

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

You know,

15

sometimes in these unique circumstances

16

situation, if you're focusing on judicial

17

conduct, what we find when we look into it,

18

it's a lot more ambiguous than you may think.

19

And I do think we have to be careful

20

about what we're requiring of the district

21

court judges.

22

situation like this and says, Your Honor, I'd

23

like to file a motion to reconsider next week,

24

is that okay?

25

me.

If somebody stands up in the

The judge says, sure, fine with

I don't think he should have to stop and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

say, well, let me research it and see if the

2

time is expired by then.

3

And then, if he says, well, if you're

4

going to file it next week, file it on Friday.

5

And it turns out Thursday's the deadline.

6

mean, the judge has misled you, the lawyer

7

would say, because he said I could file it on

8

Friday.

9

I

It turns out the rule says I couldn't.
So I'm not -- I'm not as comfortable

10

with an exception for cases where the court

11

misleads the parties because I'm not sure

12

that's as clear a case as you might think of

13

where the blame is justifiably placed on the

14

judge.

15

MR. HERSTOFF:

Again, I'm not even

16

sure I'm calling it blame.

17

the -- the parties' reasonable expectations

18

when a court -- when a district court has said

19

that they're going to reconsider.

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

I think it's just

There's nothing

21

misleading about that, I guess is the point

22

here, because the local rule had no time,

23

correct, for a motion for reconsideration?

24

district court set a time for a motion for

25

reconsideration.

The

There's nothing misleading at

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

all about that.

2
3

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, then -- well,

what's the -­

4

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

What's misleading,

5

I guess, is, in context, when you roll in Rule

6

23(f), which the district court said nothing

7

about, correct?

8
9

MR. HERSTOFF:

The district court did

not say anything -­

10

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

I mean, I just

11

don't think it's fair to say the district court

12

misled here.

13

that box necessarily.

14

I don't even think it falls into

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

The leave to file

15

a motion -- the motion for leave to file an

16

appeal, you didn't tell the judge you were

17

intending to do that, did you?

18

MR. HERSTOFF:

The Rule 23(f) was not

19

brought up at the status conference, that's

20

true.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how was the

22

judge supposed to play lawyer?

He's supposed

23

to tell you -- you ask him, let me file a

24

motion for reconsideration, he's supposed to

25

protect you and be your lawyer and tell you,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

you know, if you file it next week, you're

2

going to lose your time to appeal?

3

I don't know of any case we've ever

4

held where a judge has to tell you something

5

when you don't ask the judge about that.

6

MR. HERSTOFF:

And it's really not our

7

position that we're placing any kind of blame

8

on the district judge.

9

though, that when a district court says that

10

it's going to reconsider an order, that that

11

essentially renders the order non-final for

12

purposes of appeal.

13

It is our position,

And why would one file a petition for

14

permission to appeal when the district court

15

said we're going to take another look at this

16

order and perhaps change it.

17

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

It is -­

But can -­
-- it is a

20

non-final order.

non-final because the rules tell us it can be

judgment.

renders it not the district court's last word

it's our position that, under those

circumstances, it doesn't make sense to seek

appellate review when the order might be

10

When I say it's non-final, I mean it

The district

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You know, I suppose

12

I'm with you that it makes more sense to do the

13

motion for reconsideration before the appeal

14

and that that is true even when the appeal is

15

interlocutory, but, you know, not every rule we

16

have makes perfect sense.

17

And it just doesn't seem as though

18

you're off the hook from actually looking up

19

the rules and saying, well, look, this says 14

20

days.

21

days, or at least ask some further questions

22

about it, just because it sort of seems to make

23

sense to do a motion for reconsideration before

24

an appeal.

25

I better file this appeal within 14

MR. HERSTOFF:

Well, the rules

Heritage Reporting Corporation

actually do not specifically address

reconsideration motions, and it has been long

3

understood that a timely reconsideration motion

4

will suspend the time to appeal.

5

Now I think it would be a different

6

situation if, for instance, we were in a

7

bankruptcy appeal, which specifically says that

8

the time to appeal stops running only if you

9

file within 14 days under the bankruptcy rules,

10

and there -- there it was clear.

11

have rules that are silent with respect to

12

reconsideration motions.

13

And here you

So I think we go by the Healy, Dieter,

14

Ibarra line of cases, which say a timely

15

reconsideration motion suspends the time to

16

appeal.

17

was, indeed, timely.

18

time to appeal should be suspended and

19

therefore runs from June 24, 2015.

20

Rule 23(f) petition was filed 14 days later,

21

and the appeal, therefore, was improperly

22

deemed timely.

MR. HERSTOFF:

May I -- may I answer

the question?

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

7

MR. HERSTOFF:

Sure.

No, because we still

8

have equitable tolling and the Harris Truck

Lines and Thompson line of cases, so in either

10

circumstance the judgment should be affirmed.

11

Thank you.

Thank you,

14

Mr. Hueston, you have a minute left.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF JOHN HUESTON

16

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

17

MR. HUESTON:

Your Honor, in this

18

remaining minute, let me emphasize and direct

19

the Court's attention to PA 69 to 77, where the

20

short status conference took place.

21

And in that status conference, it is

22

notable that not only did the court not mention

23

Rule 23(f), not mention any sort of appellate

24

right, but counsel did not even mention 23(f),

25

nor even say the word appeal.

And, in fact, no mistake at all was
made by the judge in that case.

3

To have the rule that Lambert is

4

urging today would have a judge effectively

5

need to conduct a Rule 11 criminal colloquy

6

with counsel, asking if they're aware of all

7

sorts of potential related rights.

8
9

That is asking an impossible task for
a district court judge and an unfair one and

10

goes well beyond the acknowledged sharply honed

11

exception, which does not apply factually in

12

this case.

13
14
15
16

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
counsel.

Thank you,

The case is submitted.
(Whereupon, at 11:12 a.m., the case

was submitted.)
