Mr. Rosenkranz.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court:
The Ninth Circuit fixated on two words

12

in a two-sentence definition of "employer."

13

ignored how the second sentence relates back to

14

the first.

15

of the second sentence without considering the

16

first half.

17

relates to the foundational definition on which

18

the definition of "employer" is built.

19

It

It jumped right to the second half

And it ignored how all of this

Now, predictably, that wreaks havoc

20

with the statutory scheme, most notably, by

21

stripping public employees of crucial

22

protections like respondeat superior, and also

23

by treating public employers worse than private

24

ones in a statute whose purpose was to bring

25

parity to the two.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

Now, as our brief explains, the best

2

way to read the statute is from beginning to

3

end, but let me just start right in the middle,

4

as my colleagues do, with the -- with the

5

phrase that is causing all this mischief, "also

6

means."

7

Respondents do not dispute that that

8

term can have two alternative meanings.

It

9

could mean in addition, there's an additional

10

universe beyond that which is defined in the

11

first sentence.

12

elaboration of the preceding definition, along

13

the lines of "moreover" or "incorporates."

14
15

Or it could mean further

So how do we know which one is
intended?

16

The rest of the context makes clear,

17

and in particular, there are five separate

18

statutory signals, any one of which pushes the

19

reading in the direction that we've proposed,

20

aided by two canons of construction and the

21

interest in making sense out of

22

anti-discrimination law.

23

with -­

24
25

So let me start

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Rosenkranz,

what you -- what you say about making sense,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

perhaps Congress should have used the

2

formulation that was used in Title VII, where

3

it's clear, Title VII is absolutely clear, the

4

numerosity requirement goes to private and

5

public employers.

6

But this statute, ADEA, picks up on

7

the language of the Fair Labor Standards Act,

8

which has no numerosity requirement.

9

perhaps Congress should have done what you -­

So

10

you suggest, but by -- by using the Fair Labor

11

Standards Act language, rather than Title VII

12

language, because they wanted to do what Title

13

VII had done in 1972, they wanted to do that in

14

1974, why didn't they use the Title VII

15

language?

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, let

17

me start with the premise and then turn to the

18

ultimate question.

19

Your Honor's question is that Congress used the

20

definition from the FLSA.

21

The premise of the -- of

I urge the Court to look at the

22

definition in the FLSA.

23

page of the government's statutory appendix.

24

It is entirely different from this definition.

25

It is on the first

Why did Congress use a different

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

approach from Title VII when everyone

2

understood, at least everyone who was talking

3

about it understood, that the purpose was to

4

mimic what Title VII did?

5

I am attributing rationality to

6

someone who was obviously not doing his job

7

very well, but Title VII began with different

8

language, pre-amendment, from the language in

9

the ADEA.

Title VII began with language that

10

was not as expansive about the definition of

11

person, so here we have an extremely expansive

12

definition in ADEA, or "any organized group of

13

persons."

14

It is the most expansive definition

15

this Court has ever seen of "person."

16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Expansive in only

17

one -- expansive in only one way.

18

list up to the disputed "any organized group of

19

persons" all apply to private entities.

20
21

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That entire

No, not at all, Your

Honor.

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So set that at -­

No, Justice

24

Sotomayor.

Corporations -- this Court has held

25

in at least five cases that "corporations"

includes municipal corporations.

2

in every statute -- put aside those last four

3

words, corporations and associations, every

4

time this Court has encountered that

5

phraseology, it has concluded that -- that

6

political subdivisions are persons.

7

in Ricketts.

8

It did it even without a definition in cases

9

like Monell and in the federal -- in the False

10

This language

It did it

It did it in City of Chattanooga.

Claims Act -­

11

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, but here

12

it's not just persons; it's organized groups of

13

persons, and it's in a list of things that says

14

partnerships, associations, labor

15

organizations, corporations, and organized

16

groups of persons.

17

I just don't think it's a natural

18

reading to say, what, I belong to the City of

19

Bethesda.

20

Well, there's this partnership, this, and

21

Bethesda.

22

List organizations you belong to.

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, so two answers

23

to that, Your Honor.

First, even without that

24

language, this Court has found that -- that -­

25

striking that out, this Court has found that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

the definition before that language covers

2

political subdivisions.

3

Chattanooga Foundry, and Ricketts all found

4

that.

5

certainly an organized group of persons, land

6

owners under statute who get together to find a

7

common cause and collect taxes around -­

8
9

City of Lafayette,

But Mount Lemmon Fire District is most

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Counselor, even if

it's true in those cases, what's different from

10

those cases and this one is that the original

11

statute made clear that that definition was not

12

going to include states or federal government.

13

So given the sort of private nature of

14

most of the listing and the fact that the

15

statute on its face says it -- no matter what

16

you do, it's not states or government, I would

17

read it in its natural form, and I wouldn't

18

include it unless I'm told to include it

19

otherwise.

20

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, I beg to

21

differ with how the statute is structured.

22

we start with the definition of "person" in

23

subsection (a).

24
25

So

That is broad and expansive.

Subsection (b) then subtracts.

It

says it's not the federal government, oh, and,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

by the way, it's not states -- that is,

2

employer -- let me back up.

3

it's any person and, you know, 20 or more

4

people, 20 or more employees, and then it goes

5

on and subtracts the federal government and

6

states and local governments.

7
8

Employer then says

It makes no sense to subtract them
unless they were included initially in the -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, it makes no

10

sense to subtract them unless you never

11

intended to include them.

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your Honor, that's -­

13

that is certainly not the way this Court has

14

read it.

15

does it.

16

It's certainly not the way Title VII

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You assume an

17

ambiguity, that the statute can be read in two

18

ways.

19

below read it was not permissible.

20

saying a better reading is your way, correct?

21

You're not saying the way the court

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

You're just

That is correct, Your

22

Honor, but let me put it a slightly different

23

way.

24

not disputed that there are two possible ways

25

to read it.

I'm not just assuming the other side has

Our position is that when you take

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

those five statutory clues, which I've only

2

just begun to get to, the -- the only

3

reasonable reading is our reading.

4

So we've already talked about the

5

"persons" one, but there's more.

6

started with the very first signal.

7

that "also means" does not signify an

8

additional category of covered employers

9

because that's -­

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I would have
We know

Mr. Rosenkranz, if

11

-- if we disagree with you about the meaning of

12

"also," do you have any other argument

13

available to you, or is that the end of the

14

case?

15

of "also," meaning in addition to, do you lose?

If we -- if we adopt the normal meaning

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor, but

17

-- but let me just make sure, first, this Court

18

has routinely adopted statutory constructions

19

that defy the best dictionary definition.

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

That wasn't my

21

question.

My question is, if we take the best

22

dictionary definition, "in addition to," the

23

normal meaning, do you lose, or do you have

24

some other available argument?

25

delighted to hear it if you do.

I'd be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So I think we have

2

another argument, Your Honor.

3

means in addition, and so it adds agents, which

4

I'll get to in a moment, is completely

5

implausible.

6

next clause?

7

So "also means"

And then what does it do in the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

You use those words

8

a lot.

And your reply brief uses -- accuses

9

the other side of illusions, distortions,

10

disastrous and preposterous results,

11

contradictions and anomalies, pretty strong

12

language, and also contortions.

13

first page and a half of the reply brief.

That's in the

14

And I didn't see, though, and I guess

15

I expected to see, some sort of absurd results

16

argument, perhaps, that if we're going to use

17

that kind of language, but I didn't see any.

18

So it made me a little concerned.

19

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, let

20

me tell you what the absurd result is.

21

let's start with the "agent" clause.

22

So

The government's position is that

23

"also means" necessarily adds a category not

24

otherwise covered.

25

the classic agents?

If that is true, who are
Employees are the classic

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

agents.

2

That means employees are now directly

3

liable under the statute for any cause of

4

action on discrimination.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but that's -­

22

Is it disastrous under Title VII?

2

found in Burlington, that is not what the

3

"agent" clause does.

4

Why?

Because, as this Court

What the "agent" clause does is

5

incorporate respondeat superior liability,

6

which is to say -­

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That point was

8

made by the majority of circuits who ruled in

9

your favor.

Those circuits still had to deal

10

with the agent meaning and they've dealt with

11

it by addressing respondeat superior liability,

12

however they've dealt with it.

13

doesn't do away with that tension.

14

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Your meaning

Your Honor, our

meaning most certainly does.

16

complete disagreement with the government and

17

We believe it incorporates respondeat superior

21

We have a

And you can tell that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

14

the agent clause causes that mischief and that

2

it's -­

3

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

There's no -- no

4

agent involved in this case, so why should the

5

Court address that language, that the term

6

"also means" an agent of such person?

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Your Honor, for

8

the simple meaning that everyone has agreed,

9

and the Respondents have conceded in their

10

brief at page 32, that the phrase "also means"

11

has to carry the same meaning with respect to

12

both clauses.

13

and not ask what would "also means" produce if

14

you apply that to the first clause.

So you can't just jump over one

15

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

16

JUSTICE KAGAN:

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I -­

Mr. Rosenkranz -­
But I think

18

you get -- your argument comes back and bites

19

you, I think, because you just said they have

20

to be treated the same, 1 and 2.

21

Your theory with respect to 2, a state

22

or political subdivision, is that it's already

23

included in the first part of the statute.

24
25

So that would seem to be an argument
you have to make with respect to 1, the agent,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

that the agent of such a person is already

2

included in the first part.

3

So I don't see how your argument

4

answers the problem that you use to undermine

5

the other side's argument.

6

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, Mr. Chief

7

Justice, it does for the following reason.

8

What does the "also means" clause do?

9

avoidance of doubt clause.

10

It's an

It avoids doubt in

two different ways.

11

The first way is by adding that

12

"agent" clause and saying employers, the

13

aforementioned employers, that universe, are

14

subject to respondeat superior liability.

15

The second clause also avoids doubt by

16

making it clear that when you are talking about

17

employers, those persons defined in the first

18

sentence, you are including political

19

subdivisions and states.

20

And I have to emphasize that you know

21

that the "agent" clause is problematic because

22

of the extremes to which Respondents go to

23

redefine "agent."

24

third-party independent subcontractor, because

25

they cannot accept the possibility that, as is

They define "agent" to mean

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

clear under the common law for hundreds of

2

years, agents, the classic agent, are

3

employees.

4

So without the "agent" clause -­

5

excuse me, when you define the "agent" clause

6

the way Respondents do, you do end up with a

7

disaster.

8
9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Rosenkranz, in the

term "also means" in that sentence, you agree,

10

don't you, that the term is the same term as in

11

the first sentence?

12

is employer, is that correct?

In other words, the term

13

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

14

JUSTICE KAGAN:

15

employer also means?

16

choices -­

17
18
19
20
21
22
23
24
25

The term is?
Employer, the term

I mean, here are your two

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Yes, the antecedent

-JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- the term employer

or the term person.
MR. ROSENKRANZ:

I'm sorry?

If you

could just -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:
the second sentence?

What is the term in

Is it an employer?

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Oh.

Yes, the term

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

employer also means.

2

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Okay.

So it -- it's

3

just odd because you say that what this clause

4

is meant to do is to make clear that "person"

5

is defined in such a way as to include

6

subdivisions.

7

So what you're essentially doing is

8

converting the phrase which says the term

9

"employer" also means, and converting that into

10

the term "person," just to make clear,

11

includes.

12

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

No, Your Honor, no.

13

What we are doing is referring back to

14

employer.

So the first sentence says who is an

15

employer.

Who is an employer?

16

has at least 20 employees and that affects

17

commerce.

18

An entity that

Now that is a universe.

The term in

19

our view also means clarifies that within that

20

universe we're doing two things.

21

applying agency liability to that universe of

22

aforementioned persons who are now labeled

23

employers -­

24
25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

We're

But the clarifying

with respect to the subdivisions would not be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
18
1

necessary, except for the fact that there's

2

doubt in the person definition.

3

your doubt comes from.

4

that the person definition is not unambiguous.

5
6

That's where

It comes from the fact

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

That is one of the

sources of the doubt, yes.

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I don't -- I don't -­

8

what is the other source of the doubt?

9

all the source of the doubt, isn't it?

10

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

It's

Well, no, because

11

there are other -- there are other statutory

12

problems that get created completely apart from

13

that.

14

So, for instance -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

No, I understand that

15

you say that there are anomalies if done in a

16

different way, but the doubt arises from the

17

ambiguity of the term "person."

18

So that's why I'm suggesting that it

19

would be a strange way to resolve that doubt,

20

instead of to just say, by the way, a person

21

includes a subdivision, instead of saying that,

22

to say the term "employer" also means a

23

subdivision.

24
25

MR. ROSENKRANZ:
Honor.

Understood, Your

This is a strange statute that was

for that.

3

There is a reason

This -- this gets to one of my other

4

statutory clues, and that is when you think

about the -- the evolution of this statute, it

And it then -- this statute always had "also

what this Court -- I would say Manhart kind of

3

don't want a number attached.

4

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Well, we are going -­

5

JUSTICE BREYER:

They don't want you

6

to set up 100 subsidiaries each with one

7

employee and get out of the statute.

8
9

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So -- so let's just

be clear -­

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

Is it possible?

11

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

-- private entities

12

are always covered under this -- under this

13

statute.

14
15

JUSTICE BREYER:

No, I'm not talking

about public -­

16

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

Right.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

Private entities, it

18

says, the term employer is a person -- maybe

19

I've just gotten mixed up.

20

I don't think so.

It means a person engaged in an

21

industry who has 20 or more employees.

So what

22

I'm trying to imagine is through the use of

23

subsidiaries there is no company that has more

24

than 10 employees.

25

thing they might have wanted to do is to use

And to avoid that, one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

the word "agency" without a qualification that

2

the agency has to have 20 employees.

3

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

So, Your Honor, all I

4

can say is there's no reason to believe

5

Congress was ever focused on that -­

6

JUSTICE BREYER:

On that problem?

7

MR. ROSENKRANZ:

-- on that scenario.

8

That was never before Congress.

What was

9

before Congress and what this Court held as to

10

Title VII in Burlington is that that language

11

is about respondeat superior.

12

But let me get -- I've already

13

mentioned two clear signals.

14

third one, which is a variation on the agent

15

point.

16

Let me get to the

While we disagree on what the agent

17

clause does, everyone agrees that it does

18

something important.

19

to Respondents, it protects employees from the

20

independent -- from -- excuse me, from the

21

discriminatory acts of independent contractors.

22

At a minimum, according

So the question arises:

Why did

23

Congress supply that important protection only

24

to private employees and not to public ones?

25

Because that is the consequence of Respondents'

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

reading.

2

Fourth signal:

Affecting commerce.

3

And what Congress did with that phrase -- now,

4

for now, I am not making a constitutional

5

argument.

6

I am making a drafting argument.
In every one of these discrimination

7

statutes, Congress felt the need to provide an

8

explicit Commerce Clause hook.

9

private employers under the ADEA.

It did so for
It did so

10

for all employers, public and private, under

11

Title VII and the ADA.

12

Now one can have an interesting -- an

13

interesting constitutional debate about whether

14

that hook was constitutionally required, but my

15

point here is simpler.

16

necessary in every other context, so why would

17

Congress have left it out here?

18

Congress thought it was

And then the fifth statutory clue is

19

the statutory history.

20

described how the drafters got to where they

21

got, but let's look at two things.

22

And I've already

The first is how they got -- how they

23

changed the language in -- in 630(b).

24

took words that had a particular -- that were

25

on the exclusion side, and they moved it to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So they

statute in a way that makes that superfluous.

It is not.

6

statute.

7

major change.

8

It was absolutely essential to

It was essential because that was the

Now look at 630(c).

We don't have a

9

red line in -- in our brief on this one, but

10

you can see it in the government's statutory

11

appendix at -- excuse me, you can see it in -­

12

in our statutory appendix.

13

So the term "employment agency," it's

14

defined there.

15

it said "but shall not include any agency of

16

the United States or any state or political

17

subdivision of a state, except such term shall

18

apply," and -- and so forth.

19

It means anyone.

Originally,

Congress crossed out everything after

20

"the United States."

21

done this would have been to now include states

22

and political subdivisions within the

23

definition of employment agency.

24
25

The only reason to have

The only way that could possibly
happen is if they were persons to begin with;

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

and, therefore, if they were persons to begin

2

with, you flow them through subdivision -- or

3

subsection (b) and they are subject to the same

4

employee limit.

5

Now, if the purpose of that second

6

sentence was to take entities that were already

7

persons and, therefore, subject to that first

8

sentence, encompassed by that first sentence,

9

and make it clear that the proviso about the

10

size no longer applies, this was a very strange

11

way to do it.

12

If there are no further questions, I'd

13

like to reserve the remainder of my time for

14

rebuttal.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JEFFREY L. FISHER

21

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

22
23

MR. FISHER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

24

The plain text of the ADEA makes

25

absolutely clear that it covers political

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

subdivisions regardless of size.

2

nothing odd, much less absurd, about that

3

result.

4

And there's

And let me start with the text and

5

clarify one thing for the Court.

6

says that we do not dispute that "also means,"

7

the key statutory phrase here, can mean

8

different things.

9

do dispute that.

10

My friend

But the truth is we actually

The meaning of "also means" is

11

additive.

12

before.

13

found throughout the U.S. Code.

14

we cite the 32 other instances in the U.S. Code

15

where the phrase "also means" appears in a

16

definitional statute.

17

-- statutes use it in an additive manner.

18

I think perhaps the most telling one -­

19
20
21

It adds something that wasn't there
And the -- the confirmation of that is

All 32 of those phrases

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
doesn't.

In our brief,

One doesn't.

And

One

And how do you deal with that one?
MR. FISHER:

I -- if you're -- if

22

you're speaking, Justice Sotomayor, of the

23

consumer statute -­

24

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

25

MR. FISHER:

Uh-huh.

-- that my friend points

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

to, I think it does use it in an additive

2

manner, because that's a statute where it says

3

"consumer" means an individual who does certain

4

things or the person's legal representative.

5

And so that itself -- I'm sorry, also

6

means the person's legal representative.

7

itself is additive.

8

talking about, for example, a court of law

9

where someone's legal representative is the

10

12

This is not a statute

alter ego of the person.

11

That

That's a situation -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, you don't

really -­

13

MR. FISHER:

-- where it's additive.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

You don't really

15

think that what the statute meant is that the

16

legal representative was giving his or her

17

private information.

18

sense.

19

is giving the consumer's information to

20

someone.

21

violation, isn't it?

22

MR. FISHER:

It's not additive in that

It's sort of that legal representative

And so the legal -- that's the

I think that's right,

23

Justice Sotomayor, but it's still talking about

24

a different source than the previous part of

25

the statute.

And I think if there's one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

potentially ambiguous provision out of 33,

2

we'll still take that, and I would turn the

3

Court to the -- perhaps I think the most

4

telling example, which is the one at pages 12

5

and 13 of our brief, about elderly families.

6

And I think the reason why that's so

7

telling is because it gives a particular

8

definition and then has a qualification at the

9

end, "or is also handicapped."

And then it

10

says the -- the word "also" means such and

11

such, and then it repeats that phrase, "or is

12

also handicapped."

13

And so Congress, when it uses the word

14

"also means," it did exactly the opposite of

15

what my friend says you should read the statute

16

here to do, which is to carry forth those -­

17

carry down to after "also means" the original

18

meaning that had come before it.

19

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Could you deal

20

with this last example, the federal -- the

21

employment agency?

22

superfluous or there's a question whether a

23

state employment agency is still covered or

24

not.

25

It -- it is either

MR. FISHER:

I think, Justice

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

Sotomayor, the latter might be the case.

2

it's not -­

3
4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, it is

superfluous under your reading.

5
6

But

MR. FISHER:

The -- the federal

agency?

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

8

MR. FISHER:

Yes.

Yes.
And I think -­

9

well, it's -- it's not superfluous in the sense

10

that just as the key provision here, subsection

11

B, the federal government is backed out at the

12

end, in a situation where I think the better

13

reading might have been to leave them out in

14

the first place.

15

And I think the reason why you see

16

explicit references to the federal government

17

in both places is because -- for two things.

18

One is the Court itself has asked Congress in

19

various ways to speak directly when it talks

20

about federal government or states being on the

21

hook for one form or another.

22

And -- and, secondly, the federal

23

government is itself treated wholly separately

24

in Section 633(a) under a different regime of

25

the ADEA.

So the federal government is just

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

put aside in all these other provisions.

2

think that's what Congress was doing there.

3

And I

So we submit to the Court that "also

4

means" is simply unambiguous.

That's the end

5

of the case, just as the Ninth Circuit said it

6

was.

7

If the Court has any doubt about that,

8

I would urge the Court to look, as my friend, I

9

think, also urges, to the comparison between

10

Title VII on the one hand and the FLSA on the

11

other hand.

12

And I think -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if -- if Congress

13

had enacted the -- the ADEA provision and Title

14

VII at the same time, do you think it's

15

plausible that Congress would have said, you

16

know, when it comes to racial discrimination,

17

we're not going to allow a suit against a

18

government entity with fewer than 25 employees,

19

but when it comes to age discrimination, we're

20

going to include every government agency no

21

matter how small?

22

MR. FISHER:

I think absolutely,

23

Justice Alito, and the reason why goes back to

24

Lorillard versus Pons and the other cases where

25

this Court has described the genesis of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

ADEA.

2

So the word the Court has used is that

3

the ADEA is a hybrid.

4

substantive anti-discrimination law on the one

5

hand and a labor statute on the other.

6

that's borne out in the provisions of the ADEA

7

which borrow the substantive

8

anti-discrimination part from the Title VII

9

language, but the rest of the statute is

10

It's a hybrid between a

largely drawn from the FLSA.

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

And

And in -­

But that's quite -­

12

that's quite abstract.

13

a policy matter Congress would say that age

14

discrimination is more pernicious and more

15

widespread, so, therefore, we have to have a

16

tougher remedy there than we do with respect to

17

racial discrimination?

18

MR. FISHER:

Do you really think as

I think that's not

19

exactly the way Congress would have thought of

20

it.

21

elements -- and I am going to answer your

22

question directly, I think -- you find in Title

23

VII that Congress was concerned with

24

associational interests, personal associations.

25

In the legislative history, you find

So one of the things behind the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

numerosity requirement in Title VII is a

2

concern about forcing very, very small groups

3

of people to associate with individuals they

4

might not like.

5

nowadays when we're talking about race

6

relations and race discrimination, but it's

7

directly in the legislative history of Title

8

VII.

9

Now that might seem antiquated

On the other hand, this goes back to

10

the ADEA being partly a labor statute as well,

11

the -- the purpose of the ADEA is to bring

12

people into the workforce and keep them there

13

and to achieve full employment of older

14

individuals.

15

noted in the report this Court discussed in

16

EEOC versus Wyoming, that was not to stamp out

17

animus-based discrimination like under Title

18

VII but to achieve full employment.

19

And as the Secretary of Labor

And so the reason why Congress may

20

have decided to have public agencies regardless

21

of size on the hook on the -- on the age side

22

and not on the race side is because of this

23

associational interest.

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

Is this, Mr. Fisher,

the only federal statute that you're aware of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

that imposes an obligation on a small political

2

subdivision but not -- does not impose the

3

corresponding obligation on a small private

4

employer?

5

MR. FISHER:

No.

And let me point you

6

to two things.

7

component of the ADEA itself, which I think no

8

one disputes, covers federal governmental

9

employers regardless of size, so we find that

10

First of all, the other

in the ADEA itself.

11

And as to state and political

12

subdivisions, you find a close analogy in the

13

FLSA.

14

the FLSA has no numerosity requirements at all

15

on the private side in the FLSA.

16

that's strictly speaking true, but enterprise

17

liability under the FLSA depends on -- which is

18

the predominant form of liability -- depends on

19

an employer having at least $500,000 of gross

20

receipts per year.

21

Now my friend says in his reply brief

That's -­

So you have a kind of rough analogy in

22

that -- in that statute to -- to a numerosity

23

requirement.

24

that has to be of a certain size.

25

In other words, you have a firm

And I'd add, Justice Kagan, you asked

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

me just about federal, but as we cite in our

2

brief in a lengthy footnote, there are many,

3

many states, the majority of states, in fact,

4

that cover political subdivisions regardless of

5

size.

6

political subdivisions regardless of size and,

7

on the other hand, still have a numerosity

8

requirement for private employers.

9

Now take that one step -­

10

Of that group, about half of them cover

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

How are -- how are

11

those state statutes raised in comparison to

12

this statute?

13
14

MR. FISHER:

I didn't hear the

beginning, Justice Ginsburg.

15

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

The state statutes,

16

you -- you say that most states include

17

political subdivisions without regard to size.

18

And do we have language in what -- the

19

language that most states use?

20

to the language that's used in -- in the ADEA

21

or -­

22

MR. FISHER:

Is it similar

Well, Justice Ginsburg,

23

these citations are all collected in Footnote 6

24

on page 29 of our brief.

25

your question is, by and large, the state

And the answer to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

statutes actually use different language.

2

it's not a case where the states are merely

3

parroting what the ADEA already says.

4

So

I think of our count there are only

5

three states that have the exact same language

6

as the ADEA.

7

language that makes it clear in other ways that

8

they're distinguishing on numerosity terms

9

between one and the other.

10

The vast majority have other

And the thing I would add to that,

11

Justice Ginsburg, is that a handful of those

12

states had that distinction even before the

13

ADEA was passed.

14

So the thing that my friend says is

15

ludicrous for Congress to have achieved

16

actually was in state statutes already.

17

state legislatures across the country had

18

already drafted statutes like this before the

19

ADEA was passed.

20

Many

And so I think, Justice Alito, to

21

bring me back to the conversation that I was

22

having with you about the reason why Congress

23

might have done this to distinguish between

24

race and age, I will grant that Congress could

25

have reasonably made the other choice as well.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

I think that Congress could have

2

decided one or the other.

3

what Congress actually did.

4

had the FLSA on the one hand and Title VII on

5

the other hand.

6

identical in the sense that when you look to

7

the definitional provisions of the Act, you

8

found first a definition of the word "person"

9

and then you found a definition of the word

10

But the proof is in
And, as I said, it

And the two statutes were

"employer."

11

And so what did Congress do in Title

12

VII?

It amended the -- it amended the

13

definition of "person" to achieve, as Justice

14

Ginsburg pointed out, a very easy solution

15

where the numerosity requirement applied to

16

political subdivisions.

17

When it amended the ADEA, in the exact

18

same Act that it amended the FLSA, indisputably

19

to cover political subdivisions regardless of

20

size, it did the same thing it did in the FLSA,

21

which is amend the definition of "employer" and

22

not the definition of "person."

23

And I'd point this Court to its own

24

decisions in cases like Gross and Nassar which

25

say that we look to not just the language

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

choices Congress made and assume it's

2

intentional.

3

choices that Congress makes and we assume those

4

are intentional.

5

We also look to structural

And so, even if I had nothing but the

6

comparison between the ADEA and Title VII,

7

under those cases, I think that would be enough

8

to remove any doubt that the Court might have

9

about what Congress was trying to achieve here.

10

But, actually, I have something more

11

here.

12

closely related.

13

Congress made exactly the same decision in the

14

FLSA.

15

I have the FLSA, of which the ADEA is
And the Court -- and the

JUSTICE ALITO:

Would you say

16

something about what your argument means for

17

the "agent" clause?

18

means" and didn't put "includes," had it

19

written the term "employer includes any agent

20

of such a person," I take it that one could not

21

be an agent without having 25 employees.

22

If Congress wrote "also

But what -- where does your

23

understanding of this sentence take us with

24

respect to agents?

25

MR. FISHER:

Justice Alito, let me

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

answer that question, if I may, in two steps.

2

I want to first start with my point of

3

agreement with the other side, which is we

4

agree that the key question is whether "also

5

means" adds something even with respect to the

6

agent clause.

7

question for the Court to ask.

8
9

We think that's an important

But this brings me back to Justice
Breyer's question, which is I don't think there

10

can be any reasonable dispute that the "agent"

11

clause does add additional entities into the

12

category of employer, and it's not just the

13

below 20 thing.

14

More fundamentally, it's agents that

15

would not otherwise be covered by respondeat

16

superior.

17

Manhart, and we explain in our brief in cases

18

like Spirt, and there's also Footnote 1 in the

19

Solicitor General's brief, that explain that

20

some independent contractors, for example, and

21

that's just to use one example, are agents of

22

an employer but are not covered by respondeat

23

superior.

That's what the Court noted in

24

JUSTICE KAGAN:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

But how -­
Where do I look on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

that?

2

same thing that Justice Alito said, that if

3

we're not going to have numbers with B, we're

4

not going to have numbers with A.

5

Because I was bothered exactly by the

And I think your colleague says, well,

6

they didn't want -- they wanted numbers -- all

7

that A does is just make sure it's principles

8

of agency and he cites Burlington.

9

MR. FISHER:

Uh-huh.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

to see, no, they had another idea?

12

some agents covered who had fewer than 20 or 25

13

employees?

14

MR. FISHER:

So where would I look
They wanted

Well, Justice Breyer, I

15

don't think you'll find a sentence to that

16

effect in the legislative history, but let me

17

-- let me make -­

18

JUSTICE BREYER:

19

MR. FISHER:

Yeah.

-- clear on one thing,

20

which is the 20 -- the 20 employee thing is

21

just the very beginning of their problems.

22

The much bigger problem is an agent of

23

any size would not be covered but for that

24

clause that would not be under respondeat

25

superior principles.

Now my friend in the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

reply brief says that we distort the meaning of

2

independent contractors, but I'd urge you to

3

read the rest of the sentence that my friend

4

quotes in the commentary to Section 14-N, and

5

also to look at Section 2 of the restatement of

6

agency called independent contractor.

7

And in both those places, the

8

restatement makes clear that some independent

9

contractors, for example, a company hired to do

10

layoffs, choose who's going to be laid off,

11

administer our benefits plan and decide what

12

the criteria are for that, those kinds of

13

people are agents, but they're not necessarily

14

covered by respondeat superior.

15

So my friend, in his reading of the

16

"agent" clause to do nothing but clarify what

17

has come before, leaves a gaping hole in the

18

ADEA and also in Title VII.

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But I guess I wonder,

20

Mr. Fisher, how your reading of the agent

21

clause allows us to make this distinction that

22

both you suggest and the solicitor general

23

suggests between entities and individuals?

24
25

I mean, it says any agent of such a
person, and it doesn't on its face make any

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

such distinction.

2

doing that?

3

So how would we go about

MR. FISHER:

So I think there's two

4

questions you would ask if you had a case

5

dealing with the "agent" clause, Justice Kagan.

6

I think this is responsive to Justice Alito as

7

well.

8
9

The first question you'd ask is
whether any agent includes employees.

Now,

10

obviously, the word "any" might suggest that it

11

does, but, on the other hand, employees are

12

already covered under respondeat superior

13

principles once you've already given the word

14

employer.

15

So it would be kind of a mystery and

16

odd why Congress would have wanted agents to be

17

speaking about employees, especially when

18

another provision of the statute defines the

19

word "employee" and it's used other ways in the

20

statute.

21

So the first question would be whether

22

"any agent" means any agent whatsoever or just

23

non-employee agents that aren't already

24

covered.

25

If you answered that question against,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

you know, what I guess would be my position as

2

I stand here, you'd -- you'd still have a

3

second question, which is if individual

4

supervisors, for example, were on the hook, the

5

question would still be, how are they on the

6

hook?

7

And as we note and the solicitor

8

general notes as well, the Fourth and Fifth

9

Circuits have held, yes, they're technically

10

liable, but they're liable under something like

11

official capacity principles.

12

right back to the employer, as one would expect

13

in any employment arrangement.

14

So they flow

So you have two questions that would

15

get you off the train to -- to where my friend

16

would like to lead you with that clause.

17

But I think the fundamental thing that

18

I would urge to the Court is that you have

19

before you in this case a simply unambiguous

20

statute in terms of every word you need to

21

decide this question presented.

22

term "employer" also means a state or political

23

subdivision.

24

this case.

25

It says the

That's all you need to decide
And it is absolutely clear.

I'd urge the Court to resist the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

temptation to go looking elsewhere in the

2

statute for ambiguity as a reason why not to

3

answer this case as to what the statute itself

4

plainly says.

5

beginning and the end of it.

6

all that other stuff, if it ever comes back to

7

the Court, for another day.

8
9

And you can leave

If there are no other questions, I'll
-- I'll wrap up now.

10
11

And that's really, I think, the

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

Mr. Bond.

13

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JONATHAN C. BOND

14

ON BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES,

15
16
17
18

AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE RESPONDENTS
MR. BOND:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

it please the Court:
The Age Act expressly covers state and

19

political subdivision employers regardless of

20

their size.

That is true for three reasons.

21

First, that is by far the most natural

22

reading of the text, given its ordinary meaning

23

and consistent usage across federal law.

24

Second, Congress rejected the ready

25

template in Title VII adopted just two years

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

earlier that did exclude small state and local

2

government employers by putting the definition

3

or by putting government employers in the

4

definition of "person."

5

that and followed the FLSA template that it

6

adopted at the same time in 1974.

7

Congress didn't do

And, third, Petitioner's contrary

8

reading would leave a sizable loophole that

9

would allow any employer to evade the Age Act

10

by outsourcing discrimination to small agents.

11

And in order to avoid that problem, Petitioner

12

is forced ultimately to abandon the core theory

13

they offer of the text that treats the two

14

clauses the same way.

15

Now, in terms of the ordinary meaning,

16

we agree with Respondent that the language

17

"also means" and its usage throughout federal

18

statutes is clear, and it's clear that Congress

19

used it in that ordinary way because it didn't

20

follow the Title VII approach.

21

Now my friend on the other side

22

suggests that the differences in the

23

definitions of "person" in Title VII versus the

24

Age Act precluded Congress from doing the same

25

thing.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

Now those differences are actually

2

quite slight.

3

15 of the blue brief appendix, but none of

4

those differences prevented Congress in 1974

5

from doing the exact same thing in the Age Act

6

that a different Congress had done two years

7

earlier in Title VII if it had wished to do so.

8
9

You can see them at pages 6 and

There are slight differences, of
course, with the FLSA, but what's common to

10

them is that they address the problem in the

11

same way.

12

put governments in the definition of employer,

13

not subject to any numerosity requirement.

14

that's the common thread.

15

They put the definition -- or they

And

So, just to touch on the questions

16

that have reached the "agent" clause, that's

17

where I think a real vulnerability for

18

Petitioner's argument is.

19

Court doesn't need to address any of the

20

broader issues or resolve the outer limits of

21

that clause because it's not implicated here

22

and nothing in this case turns on it.

23

Now it's true the

But I think it's important to bear in

24

mind that whatever the "agent" clause means, it

25

can't mean what Petitioner is offering here,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

because that interpretation, if you hold his

2

interpretation to its logical conclusion, means

3

that any employer could evade the Age Act by

4

outsourcing to small agents.

5

The one thing we know the "agent"

6

clause is supposed to do from Manhart and other

7

cases in the Title VII context is to prevent

8

what Manhart called delegating discrimination

9

to corporate shells.

But if you take

10

Petitioner's reading seriously, it means that

11

the second clause merely clarifies the first,

12

so the 20-employee threshold reaches all the

13

way to the government clause in the second

14

sentence.

15

If that's true, it has to follow

16

logically that the 20-employee threshold

17

reaches the "agent" clause in the middle.

18

I realize the Petitioner in the reply brief and

19

this morning disclaims that result, but there's

20

no way to square that disclaimer with the text.

21

Now

It would mean that the 20-employee

22

threshold starts in the first sentence, skips

23

over the "agent" clause, and lands on the

24

government clause.

25

plausible way to read this statute.

And that's simply not a
And it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

also is inconsistent with Petitioner's core

2

theory that "also means" has to operate the

3

same way across both clauses here.

4

So I think from the ordinary reading

5

of the text and the way Congress has

6

consistently used it in this statute, there's

7

only one conclusion the Court can draw.

8
9

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, if we -- if we

follow the same plain text theory of

10

interpretation that you advocate with respect

11

to the provision concerning political

12

subdivisions, wouldn't that lead us to the

13

conclusion that an agent of an employer

14

includes the employer's employees?

15

agents of the employer?

16
17
18

MR. BOND:

Aren't they

So, Your Honor, again, you

don't have to address that here, but no -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

I know we don't have

19

to address it, but we have to have a theory, an

20

understanding of the statute that makes sense,

21

and you just made an argument based on the

22

"agent" clause -­

23

MR. BOND:

Sure.

24

JUSTICE ALITO:

25

MR. BOND:

-- did you not?

Yes, Your Honor.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

JUSTICE ALITO:

2

MR. BOND:

Okay.

And the answer to your

3

question is we don't think that it would reach

4

individual liability for the -- because of the

5

two additional questions that Respondents'

6

counsel just identified.

7

And just to -- to highlight those a

8

little bit more, in the meaning of "agent," not

9

only did Congress have no reason to use "agent"

10

in its broadest sense, because employees would

11

already trigger respondeat superior liability.

12

In this statute, Congress didn't use language

13

that it has used in other statutes like the

14

FLSA that lower courts and the Department of

15

Labor have read to include individual

16

liability.

17

So if I can point you to one example.

18

The FLSA, Section 203(d) at page 1-A of the

19

appendix to our brief says that an employer

20

includes any person who acts directly or

21

indirectly in the interest of an employer with

22

respect to an employee.

23

The FMLA, the Family Medical Leave

24

Act, uses the same language.

Lower courts and

25

the Department of Labor have construed those

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

statutes to impose individual liability in some

2

circumstances.

3

You don't see that language in the Age

4

Act.

And I think it's a fair inference that

5

Congress didn't intend to impose individual

6

liability in that circumstance.

7

don't need to resolve that, but that would be a

8

strong contextual reason to reject that

9

understanding.

10

Again, you

And, in addition, even if you

11

concluded that some subset of employees or

12

supervisors were agents in some circumstances,

13

I think you still would have to answer the

14

question that the lower courts have

15

consistently answered against individual

16

liability by determining is this individual

17

employee personally liable or is instead he

18

liable only in his official or representative

19

capacity.

20

And the idea behind that is simple.

21

If you are an employee and are counted as the

22

employer only because you're acting as an

23

agent, that is, only because you are exercising

24

the authority of the employer in varying the

25

terms and conditions of a particular employee's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

employment, liability naturally runs against

2

the employer whose authority you are

3

exercising.

4

And to resolve that question, you

5

would need to consider a number of principles

6

that govern remedies law, and you'd need to

7

take cognizance of potential spillover effects

8

for other federal statutes, which we think is

9

yet another reason not to delve into those

10

issues here, because the only question you need

11

to answer is does the "agent" clause add some

12

category of additional agents.

13

By its terms, it does.

And it must do

14

so to solve the problem that this Court

15

identified in Manhart and Ellerth and other

16

places.

17

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, is that true,

18

Mr. Bond?

19

theory, which is to say that this is just a

20

reference to respondeat superior liability and

21

basically says that the employer shall have

22

such liability for any agent, wouldn't that

23

include these corporate shells that you're

24

talking about?

25

Because, on -- on Petitioner's

MR. BOND:

So a few points on that,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

Your Honor.

2

if Petitioner is correct that the clause simply

3

codifies existing principles of respondeat

4

superior and agency liability, no, the employer

5

would not face liability for acts of

6

independent agents, at least in the ordinary

7

course.

8

respondeat superior liability, a principal is

9

not responsible for acts of independent agents

10

The general rule is that, unlike

unless you specifically intend the result.

11
12

First, if -- if Respondent -- or

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Independent

contractors, is that what you meant?

13

MR. BOND:

Or -­

Well, independent agents,

14

so agents that are not employees, non-employee

15

agents, which can include -­

16
17

JUSTICE KAGAN:
--

18

MR. BOND:

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

20

But even in the face

-- independent contractors.
-- of statutory

language that says the agent of such a person?

21

MR. BOND:

So -­

22

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I -- I mean, these

23

corporate shells are acting as the agent of

24

such a person.

25

MR. BOND:

So let's distinguish two

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

things.

2

urging that the clause would incorporate

3

respondeat superior and ordinary agency

4

principles which, under Restatement Section 250

5

of Agency and 409 of Torts, would not pick up

6

acts of agents who are not employees in the

7

ordinary course.

8
9

As I understand it, Petitioner is

Now, if what you're suggesting is that
the language or the reference to agents here

10

incorporates a broader theory of agency

11

liability, that still leaves Petitioner with a

12

difficulty of squaring how the two clauses

13

work, because he says the "agent" clause and

14

the government clause must operate in the same

15

way.

16

But you can't read the two clauses as

17

doing those fundamentally different things, one

18

creating a novel principle of agency law and

19

the other incorporating an employee numerosity

20

requirement that doesn't apply to agents in the

21

middle.

22

So -­
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I'm not

23

-- I'm not sure what's so bad about direct

24

agent liability.

25

the manager who runs the -- the shop, the

I mean, let's say you have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

factory, and he decides, well, I'm going to

2

fire everybody over 45, or whatever it is.

3

maybe the person fired wants to sue the

4

company; maybe the company's bankrupt.

5

what -- what's the big deal about -- it would

6

seem to me that that would allow you to sue the

7

person responsible for the decision.

8
9

MR. BOND:

And

I mean,

So we agree that it's not

so anomalous as Petitioner suggests.

There are

10

federal statutes that lower courts and agencies

11

have construed as imposing that kind of

12

liability.

13

why you don't need to delve into that here.

14

The answer is not clear.

15

that there are strong contextual indicators

16

that, in this statute, Congress didn't intend

17

to achieve that result.

18

that's the conclusion at the end of the day in

19

a case where it's properly presented, that

20

there is some individual liability, that's much

21

less anomalous than reading the text in a way

22

that no dictionary or other statute uses it and

23

creating a huge loophole for outsourcing to

24

agents of any size under 20 employees.

25

And that's, again, another reason

We think

But you're right, if

If the Court have -- has no further

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

questions, we ask that you affirm.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF E. JOSHUA ROSENKRANZ

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

7
8

MR. ROSENKRANZ:
Honor.

9

Thank you, Your

A few just brief points:
First, Mr. Fisher's explanation of

10

"agency" is at war with Burlington.

11

said that the reason that there is respondeat

12

superior in Title VII is because of the "agent"

13

clause.

14

This Court

Nothing else created that.
The difference between Title VII and

15

Title IX here is crucial.

16

has no respondeat superior liability.

17

Because it did not have an "agent" clause.

18

Gebser said Title IX
Why?

Now I'm not saying that there is no

19

liability for that third-party agent.

20

course, there's liability.

21

here doesn't just implement respondeat

22

superior; it implements agency principles as to

23

both employees and the -- the independent

24

agent.

25

Of

The "agent" clause

That doesn't mean that agents

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

themselves have to have 20 employees.

2

clear from the wording -- the wording of the

3

statute.

4

employer is anyone who has 20" -- "is a person

5

who has 20 or more employees and also affects

6

commerce."

7

So you start with (b), it says, "The

Then it says, "That also means any

8

agent of such person."

9

the employer who needs 20 employees.

10
11

That's

The "such person" is
The agent

does not need 20 employees.
So let me just go to an observation

12

about the relationship between the FLSA and

13

Title VII.

14

out that there's a distinction between the FLSA

15

and Title VII in this Court's jurisprudence.

16

It's a procedure/substance

Mr. Fisher and Mr. Bond both point

17

distinction, though.

18

substantive, this Court has typically referred

19

to Title VII as the analog.

20

Anything that is

So I recognize, Your Honors, that

21

neither reading is perfect, but it really comes

22

down to a choice between a reading that is, at

23

worst, mildly ungrammatical and one that is

24

wildly untenable.

25

to legislative drafters a level of grammatical

Respondents are attributing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

sophistication that is unrealistic.

2

Meanwhile, the list of problems that

3

Respondents are creating with their reading is

4

really untenable.

5

that Congress would have singled out public

6

entities for harsh treatment in a statute whose

7

whole purpose was to bring public employees

8

into the ambit that private employees occupied.

9

First, it is unfathomable

Second, Respondents rewrite the

10

statute so that "agent" means independent

11

third-party contractor and they say employees

12

are not agents.

13

wave away the problems that are created by that

14

reading.

15

regional circuits all agree with our reading,

16

and that is all moved away under Respondents'

17

reading.

18

You cannot just wave around -­

It is not peripheral.

Twelve

Third, Respondents have not explained

19

why Congress would have stripped public

20

employees of valuable rights such as respondeat

21

superior liability that private employees have.

22

The protection is not in the word "employer."

23

It's in the agency clause.

24

public employees under Respondents' reading

25

lose all recourse for the acts of third-party

But, at a minimum,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

contractors.

2

That is at least clear.

So, since there's a reasonable reading

3

of the statute that achieves Congress's stated

4

goal without creating any of this mischief,

5

that is the reading that this Court should

6

adopt.

7
8

If there are no further questions, we
respectfully request that the Court reverse.
