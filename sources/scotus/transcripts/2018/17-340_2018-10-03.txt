ORAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10
11

MR. BOUTROUS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
The First Circuit held that

12

independent contractor agreements are contracts

13

of employment and, therefore, they were exempt

14

from the Federal Arbitration Act.

15

of Section 1's exemption is contrary to the

16

plain meaning of the statute and its structure,

17

purpose, history, and context.

This reading

18

This Court, for many years going back

19

to before when the Federal Arbitration Act was

20

enacted, has said over and over again that if

21

Congress uses words like "employment" or

22

"employee" or "employer" in a statute without

23

further helpful definition, it intends for the

24

common law agency rules to govern that govern

25

an employer and employee relationship.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

In the Section 1 exemption, Congress

2

did not define or suggest it was coming up with

3

a new, creative interpretation of the word

4

"employment" or "employees," which was also

5

used in that clause.

6

decision -­

7

The First Circuit's

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

How about the word

8

"work" -- "worker" in the very clause?

Shall

9

apply to contracts of employment of seamen,

10

railroad employees, or any other class of

11

workers engaged in foreign or interstate

12

commerce.

13

Congress didn't use the word

14

"employees" if it meant employees.

15

much broader term, "workers."

16

MR. BOUTROUS:

17

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

18

inform what it meant by "contract of

19

employment"?

It used a

20

MR. BOUTROUS:

But it -­
Shouldn't that

I think it does, Your

21

Honor.

A contract of employment of a worker.

22

So, if the worker had a different type of

23

contract, a contract that's an independent

24

contractor agreement, it would fall squarely

25

outside the statute.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No.

But it said

2

it shall apply to any other class of workers,

3

not employees.

4

It used a much broader term.

MR. BOUTROUS:

It's -- Your Honor,

5

it's a residual clause that follows contracts

6

of employment of any other class of worker.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But what we're

8

trying to decide is what employment -­

9

"contract of employment" means.

And if it

10

meant only employees, Congress naturally, I

11

would assume, would have used the word "any

12

other class of employees," but instead it chose

13

a much broader word, "workers."

14

MR. BOUTROUS:

Well, Your Honor, I

15

think, as we have -- have argued, the fact that

16

the railway -- railroad employees is also -- is

17

mentioned right before that, seamen, which are

18

traditionally common law master-servant

19

employees, demonstrates the -­

20

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, except your

21

adversary has pointed out that under the Seamen

22

Act, it covered people who were not contracts

23

of -- seamen are not just people who are

24

employees; it also is the tugboat operator

25

who's on the boat guiding it.

It's other

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

people who are not simply employees.

2

MR. BOUTROUS:

But Congress, just five

3

years earlier in the Jones Act, defined seamen

4

under the Jones Act as actions in the course of

5

their employment, and as employees, this

6

Court's Chandris decision also uses the common

7

law definition of substantial connection.

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What -- what do you

9

make of the other side that says in the seamen

10

category, the -- the ship's surgeon, the pilot

11

qualify as seamen who are outside the Federal

12

Arbitration Act, even though they're

13

independent contractors, not common law

14

employees?

15

MR. BOUTROUS:

Justice Ginsburg, I

16

think the -- the physician example is a good

17

one.

18

Respondent didn't involve a question of

19

independent contractor or anything like that.

20

It was -- the question was could the captain,

21

basically, override the Hippocratic oath in

22

terms of the physician exercising his

23

independent judgment.

24
25

The case that has been cited by the

And I don't think the Court has to
determine whether every seaman is -- is an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

employee or not.

The question is whether they

2

had a contract of employment.

3

And under this Court's decision in

4

Circuit City, the Court emphasized that the

5

exemption to the Federal Arbitration Act for

6

contracts of employment should be given a

7

narrow construction and a precise reading in

8

order to defer to the pro-arbitration policies

9

of the Federal Arbitration Act.

10

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

More narrow in the

11

sense that it was limited to transportation

12

workers?

13

MR. BOUTROUS:

In -- in that case,

14

yes, Your Honor, that was -- that was the

15

issue.

16

120 to 121 of Circuit City, the Court in

17

talking about seamen, railroad employees, air

18

carrier -- the air carrier employees who were

19

added to the Railway Labor Act in 1935, I

20

believe, this Court said over and over again

21

these were employment relationships, talking

22

about the relationship between employees and

23

employers.

24

clearly contemplating exactly what the statute

25

says, that a contract of employment is a

But the overall thrust, if -- on page

So this Court in Circuit City was

2

independent contractor agreement.

3

It's not an

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, you keep

4

in your brief -- and the other side raises this

5

concern -- you -- you quickly shift the

6

discussion of -- of contracts of employment to

7

whether or not there's an employee/employer

8

relationship.

9

And simply because someone would be

10

considered or not considered an employee

11

doesn't necessarily answer the question of

12

whether it's a contract of employment.

13

think naturally of employing an independent

14

contractor.

15

People

So I don't know why -- the question is

16

not employee/employer.

It's employment.

And

17

employment in -- in many of these contexts has

18

a broader scope than the existence of an

19

employee/employer relationship.

20

MR. BOUTROUS:

It's absolutely true,

21

Your Honor, there are many different

22

definitions of employment out there, but as I

23

said, the Court's decision in National Mutual

24

Insurance Company versus Darden, which we've

25

cited, and in the Community -- Community for

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

Creative Non-violence versus Reid case, which

2

Darden cites, says that Congress -- we're going

3

to assume that when Congress uses "employee" in

4

Darden but in Reid the Court used "employment"

5

and said when those terms are used by Congress,

6

we -- we -- we assume Congress intended for the

7

ordinary terms to be used.

8

And here -­

9

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Except the problem

10

is that we don't really assume that because the

11

other side has prevented us -- presented us

12

with multiple cases, many of them in which

13

we've used "contract of employment" to mean

14

employees and independent contractors.

15

It's all contextual, isn't it?

16

MR. BOUTROUS:

Not really, Your Honor.

17

Most of the cases, the vast -- I'll give them

18

this:

19

cataloguing haphazard, in passing, uses of

20

"contract of employment" where it wasn't an

21

issue.

22

attorney and a client, a court years ago called

23

it a contract of employment.

24
25

They did a -- they did a good job of

So, in describing a case about an

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, what do we do

about the fact that, less haphazardly, your -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

your colleague on the other side has documented

2

that back in 1925, which is when the statute

3

was enacted, and I think you'd agree that we

4

have to interpret it as a reasonable reader

5

would have at that time, didn't necessarily

6

distinguish between independent contractors and

7

employees with the degree of care that the law

8

has subsequently come to use.

9

And maybe even that your own client

10

doesn't use.

11

speaks of employing, I believe -- I can't

12

remember the exact variation of the word -- but

13

it treats these independent contractors as

14

employing them.

15

According to its website, it

So what do we -- what do we do about

16

the fact that that is at least an available

17

reading still today and that there's a lot of

18

historical evidence at the time of the statute

19

in question that "contract of employment" may

20

have swept more broadly?

21

MR. BOUTROUS:

A couple things,

22

Justice Gorsuch.

First, I don't agree with

23

Respondent that -- that the independent

24

contractor/contract of employment distinction

25

was not well established.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

It was deeply embedded.

This Court's

2

decision in the Coppage case, which we cite in

3

our reply brief, specifically, rhetorically

4

acts as if everyone would know about this

5

distinction.

6

from 1920.

7

Contracts of Employment, and it made the

8

explicit distinction -- and this Court has over

9

the years cited Mr. Conyngton in its cases -­

We cited the Conyngton treatise
It had an entire chapter called

10

that contracts of employment were different

11

than independent contractor agreements.

12
13
14
15
16

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But other

treatises didn't?
MR. BOUTROUS:

We cited another

treatise, Your Honor.
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

But other -­

17

you're not -- you're not denying other

18

treatises -- other treatises didn't treat them

19

differently?

20

MR. BOUTROUS:

Well, they didn't

21

really -- to the extent they addressed the

22

issue, the distinction was well established,

23

Your Honor.

24

of authorities where it just wasn't a

25

discussion or an issue.

Again, Respondent has cited a lot

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

In the -- the need for a narrow

2

construction of Section 1 in order to further

3

the pro-arbitration policies of the Act, plus

4

the presumption that Congress meant what it

5

said when it said employment, that means even

6

if we come to a draw or even if they come up

7

with some other authorities, the background

8

presumption is that Congress meant contract of

9

employment.

10

And I think it's also important that

11

it's been nearly 100 years, and no court had

12

ever decided that the words "contracts of

13

employment," which are pretty clear, mean

14

something completely different.

15

The First Circuit and Mr. Oliveira

16

contend that those words mean agreement to

17

work.

18

wanted to say agreement to work, it could have

19

said that.

20

But if Congress, Justice Sotomayor, had

It said contracts of employment.

So I think it's just very clear from

21

the language of the statute that Congress

22

intended traditional employment agreements to

23

be the subject of the exemption.

24
25

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
the gateway question?

Clearly -­

Can you address

Who decides this?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

MR. BOUTROUS:

Your Honor, we believe

2

that the Court's cases like Rent-A-Center and

3

First Options and that talk about whether you

4

have a valid delegation clause, in the first

5

instance, the issue goes to the arbitrator

6

because the parties agree to -- to arbitrate

7

issues concerning what's arbitrable.

8

that's what this is.

9

And

We -- we admit, we concede, that it's

10

a bit different than some of the Court's cases,

11

so the -- the Kindred Nurseries case that -­

12

that ruled -- where the Court ruled that the

13

Federal Arbitration Act did apply to a

14

contract, one that there was a dispute about

15

formation, and the party there had argued that

16

because there was a dispute as to whether an -­

17

an agreement was formed, the FAA hadn't been

18

triggered.

19

But -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

But if Section 1

20

puts an entire category, even if you say it's a

21

narrow category, outside the arbitration act

22

entirely, it's exempt from the Federal

23

Arbitration Act, then how can you use the

24

arbitration act?

25

never come into play because agreements that

The delegation clause would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

fit the description, contracts of employment,

2

they're outside the Federal Arbitration Act.

3

That can't -- you can't use the Act to enforce

4

any arbitration.

5

MR. BOUTROUS:

Yes, Your Honor, that

6

-- that's Respondent's argument.

7

recognize it is a bit different than Kindred

8

Nurseries, but it's -- it's very similar in the

9

sense that the party there was arguing the

And -- and I

10

Federal Arbitration Act isn't triggered because

11

the agreement's invalid from the get-go.

12

But the main point I would like to

13

make on this issue about delegation is we trust

14

courts too.

15

district court did originally was to -- to rule

16

that correct -- first ruled correctly that

17

contracts of -- this was not a contract of

18

employment, so the -- that issue needed to be

19

looked at.

20

Our main concern about what the

And -- but then the court said there

21

would be discovery and then a trial to

22

determine whether the exemption applied.

23

we respectfully submit that the -- if a -- if a

24

court -- whoever decides this, an arbitrator or

25

a court, it should be done based on the four

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

corners of the contract and based on what the

2

-- whether it's a contract of employment or an

3

independent contractor agreement.

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

I thought the -­

5

the trial handler was supposed to determine

6

whether this was an independent contractor and,

7

therefore, outside the Section 1 exemption?

8
9

MR. BOUTROUS:

Exactly, Your Honor.

And -- and our point is that's the really

10

merits of the case.

11

argument is -- is that in -- in actual fact, he

12

was -- he was an employee in the way the

13

relationship in practice functioned.

14

The -- Mr. Oliveira's

So that's the merits.

So, if we're

15

required to have a trial in federal district

16

court about that issue, and -- and if New Prime

17

prevails and it's determined that he's actually

18

an independent contractor, the right to

19

arbitrate that issue would have basically been

20

defeated.

21

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Boutrous, you -­

22

you moved nicely to the merits, but just so we

23

haven't ignored where we've moved so quickly in

24

response to Justice Ginsburg's question, and I

25

share the same concern, so perhaps you can help

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1
2

me.
Before a court can do anything, issue

3

an order under Section 4 compelling

4

arbitration, that's what you want, is an order

5

from the district court compelling arbitration,

6

I would have thought it would have had to

7

satisfy itself that it had the power to issue

8

such an order.

9

And Section 1 has this carve-out.

And

10

why isn't it more like a challenge to the

11

delegation provision itself if you want to use

12

Rent-A-Center as your authority, as I believe

13

you do, rather than a challenge to the

14

underlying contract?

15

analogy, I would have thought the analogy would

16

have worked the other way.

17

If we're going to make an

MR. BOUTROUS:

Help me.

I -- I -- I think, Your

18

Honor, I have to say that is another analogy.

19

And it's -- and it's one that -- it's another

20

way the Court could go.

21

But, here, the -- the presumption's

We have an

On the face of the Federal Arbitration

5

exception.

6

over an issue, any issue arising from the

7

agreement, it would go to an arbitrator.

9

The

We agreed that if we had a dispute

And so it's not a question of
jurisdiction.

The federal district court, I

10

think, had the power, inherent power, to stay

of an agreement, aside from the Federal

asking on that issue for the Court to take

another step.

But I do recognize that we're

that point, it's the Respondent who's asking

for an upheaval.

every word in the exemption is a surprise word.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Now, but just

so you -- saying that the arbitrator will

decide arbitrability, there are different

degrees of arbitrability.

say, for example, if you have an agreement,

we'll arbitrate all disputes on the plant

whether it applies there.

And then, you know, the company builds

That's sort of

But if the issue is does the Act apply

at all, that seems to be on a different order

22

of magnitude.

23

to say that the arbitrator gets to decide

whether a court can decide -- compel

25

arbitration at all.

And it seems quite another thing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

19
1

MR. BOUTROUS:

It is a different

2

thing, Your Honor.

3

if the -- if the question is whether a district

4

court would decide this, we'd be happy to have

5

the federal district court interpret the

6

contract or this Court could -- could do it.

7

And -- and we -- as I said,

The contract is an independent

8

contractor agreement on its face.

So -- so I

9

-- I do think it is a different inquiry.

We -­

10

and this Court has never held that interpreting

11

that provision is an arbitrability issue that

12

can be sent up -­

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well, the -- the

14

reason that it's different is that when you

15

decide whether parties have agreed to arbitrate

16

arbitrability, is there an arbitration clause

17

or not, you're looking to their intent in a

18

contract document.

19

there are procedural bars to this arbitration,

20

you're looking to interpret a contract again,

21

which will have the thing there.

22

When you decide whether

All right?

Here, we are not doing that.

23

interpreting a statute.

24

-- well, all right.

25

seems to me, very different.

We are

And there is no reason

You see, I mean, it is, it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

As to the general question, if you

2

read this just off the bat, you might think

3

there is a whole category of arbitration called

4

labor arbitration, and labor arbitration even

5

in 1925 and before worked pretty well.

6

And so you might have thought that

7

Congress had in mind we're not talking here

8

about labor arbitration.

9

business arbitration.

We're talking about

And particularly labor

10

arbitration where we don't have constitutional

11

authority to act because that's what people

12

thought in 1925.

13

And so that is not just a dictionary

14

word.

15

trying to exclude arguments between employees

16

not in interstate commerce, et cetera, and

17

their employers from this statute.

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

to the question I asked a while ago.

2

understand you'd be perfectly happy to have a

3

court decide the arbitrability issue here?

4

MR. BOUTROUS:

Did I

Your Honor, we -- we

5

think that the -- that there's a -- as we've

6

argued, that this falls within Rent-A-Center,

7

maybe one step beyond, but if the Court were to

8

rule that independent contractor agreements are

9

not contracts of employment, but we need a

10

court, either this Court or the district court

11

to decide that, as I said, we trust courts too

12

to make that determination.

13

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I must

14

have missed it.

15

fighting over the question of whether a court

16

or an arbitrator should decide the

17

arbitrability in this case.

18

the first question presented.

19

I thought there was a lot of

MR. BOUTROUS:

I thought that was

That -- that is the

20

first question presented.

We stand on it, Your

21

Honor.

22

main problem we have with what the district

23

court ordered, the principal problem, was that

24

it was going to be a trial on the main issue,

25

in fact, the issue Justice Ginsburg mentioned,

I'm not abandoning it.

But the -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

that is this really an independent contractor

2

agreement; is it a contract of employment?

3

The statute focuses on the contract,

4

not on the activities.

And so the first step

5

we would respectfully submit, if the Court

6

rejects our argument about arbitrability, would

7

be to rule that this goes back to the district

8

court or this Court rules on -- as a matter of

9

law based on the contract, and then the case,

10

if -- if we're correct that it is an

11

independent contractor agreement, I think it's

12

-- on the undisputed facts, it is, it has all

13

the elements, then we go to arbitration and

14

then we litigate the issue -­

15

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is there any other

16

area of law where we take the party's label,

17

"employee" versus "independent contractor," and

18

give it binding effect?

19

for virtually every other purpose in tax law,

20

labor law -- I just don't know another area

21

where we take the form of the contract as

22

dispositive of a legal issue, of whether you're

23

an employee or an independent contractor?

24
25

MR. BOUTROUS:
can't think of one.

-- and on that point, Your Honor, in terms of

determining whether it -- it's arbitrable, my

19

only point was that whether it's the arbitrator

20

or the court, the inquiry should be, what is

21

this agreement?

22

on its face, the four corners of the agreement?

23

Is it a contract of employment

If -- if it -- if it is, then it's

24

exempt from the Act.

If it's an independent

25

contractor agreement, it's subject to the Act.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And then the arbitrator would do, Your Honor,

2

what you were suggesting:

was this a legitimate agreement, what was it,

With that, Mr. Chief Justice, I'd like

ORAL ARGUMENT OF JENNIFER D. BENNETT

11

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

12
13

MS. BENNETT:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

14

It's black-letter law that statutes

15

are interpreted according to their ordinary,

16

common meaning, not now but at the time they

17

were passed.

18

that in 1925, when the Federal Arbitration Act

19

was passed, the words "contract of employment"

20

were a general category for agreements to

21

perform work.

22

common law servants, as well as independent

23

contractors.

24
25

And there's overwhelming evidence

They included the agreements of

Whether you look at statutes, case
law, newspaper articles, even actual contracts

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

themselves, the result is the same:

2

majority of sources call independent

3

contractors' agreements to perform work

4

"contracts of employment."

5

The vast

And perhaps most relevantly, Congress

6

itself repeatedly used the phrase that way.

7

Congress passed multiple statutes

8

contemporaneous with the FAA that all used the

9

phrase "contracts of employment" to refer to

10

independent contractors' agreements to perform

11

work.

12

Prime has said nothing about these

13

statutes at all.

14

mountain of sources that use the phrase

15

"contracts of employment" to refer to

16

independent contractors' agreements to perform

17

work as people unthinkingly using the term that

18

way.

19

Instead, Prime dismisses the

But that's, in fact, precisely the

20

point.

Without even thinking about it,

21

everyone, from this Court to Congress, to

22

newspaper articles, to ordinary contract

23

drafters themselves, everyone understood the

24

category "contracts of employment" to include

25

the agreements of independent contractors, as

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

well as other workers.

2

JUSTICE ALITO:

That -­
Does the concept of a

3

-- a contract of employment involving a class

4

of workers -- and Justice Sotomayor focused on

5

the term "workers" -- a class of workers

6

engaged in foreign or interstate commerce,

7

apply to all independent contractors who are

8

engaged to perform some type of work?

9

MS. BENNETT:

It would apply to all

10

independent contractors who are engaged in

11

foreign or interstate commerce.

12

this Court has said that the class of workers

13

engaged in foreign or interstate commerce is

14

quite narrow, actually.

15

directly involved in transporting goods or so

16

closely associated to it to be assumed to be

17

essentially directly involved.

18

And this -­

JUSTICE ALITO:

It's people who are

So anybody who's

19

involved?

20

distinctions among the -- the types of

21

independent contractors who might be covered?

22
23
24
25

It doesn't -- there are no

MS. BENNETT:

No, Your Honor.

As long

as they're a worker, then -- then anybody is -­
JUSTICE ALITO:

For that -- but

anybody who does work is a worker?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

MS. BENNETT:

Correct.

That's

2

correct, Your Honor.

3

you look at the historical context and the

4

statutory context when this exemption was

5

enacted.

6

And this makes sense if

So Circuit City says that the

7

exemption was trying to achieve two goals.

The

8

first goal is Congress was trying to avoid

9

conflicts with preexisting dispute resolution

10

statutes.

11

resolution statutes in force at the time define

12

their scope functionally in terms of the work

13

that was performed, not in terms of the

14

worker's employment status.

15

And the preexisting dispute

And so, if the exemption depended on a

16

worker's employment status, it would create

17

exactly the kinds of conflicts that Congress

18

was trying to avoid.

19

So, if you look, in fact, at the

20

Transportation Act, which was the statute that

21

governed railroad workers at the time, and if

22

you look, in fact, at every dispute resolution

23

statute that preceded the Transportation Act,

24

they all define the phrase "railroad employees"

25

to mean a worker engaged in the work of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

railroad; that is, they defined it based on the

2

work that you did, not your technical

3

employment status.

4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

May I -- may I go back

5

to Justice Alito's question -­

6

MS. BENNETT:

7

JUSTICE KAGAN:

8
9

Sure.
-- and just give you a

hypothetical -­
MS BENNETT:

Sure.

10

JUSTICE KAGAN:

11

your argument includes this too?

12

that Amazon contracts with FedEx or UPS to ship

13

all its products and they want to send their

14

disputes to arbitration.

15
16
17

-- and say whether
So suppose

Does that fall within the Act or does
that fall within this exemption?
MS. BENNETT:

It would not fall within

18

the exemption.

It would be subject to the FAA.

19

And the reason for that is because the FAA

20

requires -- applies -- exempts, rather, a class

21

of workers engaged in foreign or interstate

22

commerce, not companies engaged in foreign or

23

interstate commerce.

24

wouldn't be considered a worker.

25

considered a company.

And FedEx isn't -­
They would be

JUSTICE KAGAN:

6

So -- so -­
Sorry.
-- just give me a

little bit more on that.

7

MS. BENNETT:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9
10

Sure.
In -- in every case,

we have to figure out whether a worker is
involved or a company is involved?

11

MS. BENNETT:

That's correct.

And in

12

most cases, that won't be difficult.

13

example, that's not a disputed issue.

14

seen very, very few cases where that is, in

15

fact, a disputed issue.

contracts.

21

And that's based on the text of the

The FAA says we exempt these kinds of

And so, if there are questions about

22

whether a contracted issue is the kind of

23

contract that's exempted, then a court has to

24

figure it out to determine whether the FAA

25

applies before applying it.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

And to return to the goals of the Act

2

expressed in Circuit City, so we have not

3

conflicting with preexisting statutes, and we

4

know that those statutes applied functionally.

5

They applied to people's role in work.

6

And I'll note also on -- on that first

7

goal, even if we interpret those other statutes

8

narrowly to apply solely to common law

9

employees, on Prime's interpretation, the FAA

10

would still conflict with the -- with those

11

other statutes, because even if those other

12

statutes applied only to common law employees,

13

what Prime is saying is the exemption doesn't

14

apply to common law employees.

15

whatever -- to people whose contracts say they

16

are common law employees, even if they're not.

17

It applies to

And so you'd have a whole class of

18

people, even on Prime's interpretation, that

19

would be subject both to these alternative -­

20

preexisting alternative dispute resolution

21

statutes, as well as the FAA.

22

contract was silent, anybody who was illegally

23

misclassified.

24
25

So anybody whose

And so there would be a conflict even
on Prime's own interpretation of these

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

statutes.

2

statutes, in fact, were applied functionally.

3

And, again, we know that these

The Historian's brief describes dozens

4

of cases in which the Transportation Act was

5

applied to independent contractors or people

6

working for independent contractors.

7

And -- and the second goal of the

8

statute, as Circuit City explains, beyond these

9

specific conflicts, is that Congress was

10

concerned generally with transportation

11

workers' role in the free flow of goods.

12

FAA was enacted in the wake of years of labor

13

unrest in the transportation industry that had

14

repeatedly shut down commerce.

15

The

And I want to note that this labor

16

unrest, Prime says that it was only common law

17

employees of the railroads.

18

not true.

That's, in fact,

19

The Shopmen's Strike, which happened

20

just before the FAA was passed, was caused in

21

large part by workers who were not common law

22

servants of the railroads that they were

23

striking against.

24

labor unrest and the havoc that Congress had

25

seen that people who are not common law

And so, given these years of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

servants could wreak, it makes perfect sense

2

that Congress would exempt workers based on

3

their role in the transportation of goods, that

4

is, their ability to shut down commerce, rather

5

than their technical employment status that was

6

listed in their contract.

7

It would make no sense at all for

8

Congress to treat workers who had the same

9

ability to disrupt commerce differently simply

10
11

because of what their contract said.
And I want to note that if we take

12

Prime's interpretation, that would also lead us

13

to absurd results in at least two ways.

14

on Prime's interpretation, if a worker's

15

contract is silent, that is, if it doesn't say

16

what your employment status is or not, then it

17

would be impossible to determine whether to

18

apply the contract at all.

19

First,

And, second, if a contract

20

misclassified a worker, illegally misclassified

21

a worker as an independent contractor, then the

22

FAA, unlike any other federal statute, would

23

depend on that illegal misclassification,

24

rather than the actual worker's status.

25

And so we have the text of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

statute, the context of the statute, and the

2

absurd results that would result, all leading

3

us, pointing us in the same direction.

4

And on -- quickly just on the first

5

question, I want to note that, I think, as Your

6

Honors understand, in general, we don't apply

7

statutes that don't apply.

8

is going to apply a statute, it has to figure

9

out first whether it applies.

And so, if a court

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

What of the

Petitioner's argument that, forget about the

15

FAA, that a court has inherent authority to

16

stay a proceeding pending utilization of an

17

alternate dispute resolution mechanism chosen

18

by the parties?

19

MS. BENNETT:

Your Honor, as this

20

Court has repeatedly explained, courts have a

21

duty to exercise the jurisdiction that Congress

22

has granted them.

23

are really under exceptional circumstances.

24
25

The exceptions to that duty

And one of those exceptions could be
an ongoing proceeding, but there is no ongoing

2

the duty -- the authority to just stay a

3

proceeding just because they want to or because

4

there might be some proceeding that happens in

5

the future.

6

Courts generally don't have

And I'll note that Prime did not ask

7

the court to use its inherent authority.

8

solely asked the court to rely on the FAA.

9

so the court has to decide whether the FAA

Prime

10

applies to know whether it can grant Prime's

11

request.

And

12

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

13

21

And I just want to -­

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, while we have

22

you here, you -- you -- in response to Justice

23

Alito and Justice Kagan, you raised a very

24

interesting point about the difference between

25

workers and companies.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

And similar to the kind of question we

2

have here presented between employees and

3

independent contractors, there are going to be

4

fact issues in either circumstance where a

5

district court's going to have to sort them

6

out.

7

Courts disagree over how summary those

8

procedures should be.

Let's say we're just in

9

-- in a world of workers versus companies.

10

would you expect the district court to sort

11

that out?

12

How

I mean, the FAA is supposed to resolve

13

these things quickly in a summary fashion.

14

Section 4 says if there's a dispute over

15

whether there is a contract to arbitrate, it's

16

supposed to go to a summary trial, not five

17

years of discovery and all the glories that

18

entails that we're familiar -- all painfully

19

familiar with these days.

20
21
22

But how -- how would you advise us to
write that portion of the opinion?
MS. BENNETT:

Your Honor, at first

23

blush, you could look at the contract, and it

24

would only require factual -- any sort of

25

factual inquiry, if there was a dispute about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

it, you know, say the contract was a subterfuge

2

or the contract doesn't say anything at all.

3

And in the few cases where this has

4

come up, I believe courts have resolved it

5

largely on declarations.

6

discovery would be needed to determine whether

7

a person performed the work himself.

8
9

And very limited

The question would be did the parties
contemplate that the individual who is suing

10

performed the work himself -- him or herself,

11

or did they contemplate that it would be a

12

company?

13

very limited discovery, if any at all.

14

And so that inquiry would require

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So is it safe to say

15

that we have at least common ground on one

16

thing, maybe a few things today, but at least

17

on this, that the proceedings may not be

18

limited to the form of the document before us

19

but should be summary in nature?

20
21

MS. BENNETT:
Your Honor.

Yes, I agree with that,

That's correct.

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23

what do you mean by "a company"?

24
25

MS. BENNETT:
not a real person.

What do you mean by -­

I mean anything that is

So, for example, a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

3

corporation would -- would be a company.
JUSTICE ALITO:

A corporation would be

a company?

4

MS. BENNETT:

5

JUSTICE ALITO:

6
7

Sure.
What if it's a sole

proprietorship?
MS. BENNETT:

Then the question would

8

be what did the parties contemplate, that the

9

person who owns the proprietorship would

10

perform the work himself?

And if that's true,

11

then it would be an agreement to perform work

12

of a transportation worker.

13

If that's not true -­

14

JUSTICE ALITO:

So some independent -­

15

I thought you said all independent contractors

16

would fall within this, provided that they were

17

engaged in foreign or interstate commerce in

18

the sense relevant under the FAA.

19
20
21

But now I think you're -- are you
modifying that?

So are you modifying that?

MS. BENNETT:

Yes, Your Honor, I'm

22

sorry, I misunderstood the initial question.

23

was talking about people who would be

24

considered workers.

25

So independent contractors who are

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

businesses would not fall within the exemption.

2

And that's based on the text of the exemption.

3

It has -­

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

5

businesses, what does that mean?

6

got you on corporations, but beyond that, are

7

we getting into a difficult area?

8
9
10

MS. BENNETT:

So, if they're
I mean, I've

I -- I think the -- the

-JUSTICE ALITO:

If it's a sole

11

proprietorship, if it's a partnership, but it's

12

-- it's in business.

13

MS. BENNETT:

I think it's easiest to

14

approach the question from the other direction,

15

which is to say, was this -- did the parties

16

contemplate that the person with whom they

17

agreed would personally perform the work?

18

if so, then it would be an agreement to perform

19

work with a transportation worker.

20

And,

If the parties didn't contemplate that

21

the person who agreed to do the work would

22

personally do it, then it wouldn't fall within

23

the exemption.

24
25

And so we don't need to decide the
exact definition of business; solely just is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

this an agreement for someone who is engaged in

2

commerce to personally perform the work.

3
4

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But to take one -- an

opposite extreme from UPS or FedEx -­

5

MS. BENNETT:

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.
-- you know, suppose

7

it's like Joe Smith Truckers, and Joe Smith

8

Truckers is Joe Smith and his brother, and -­

9

and the contract was with Joe Smith workers,

10
11

and he says "my brother will do the work."
MS. BENNETT:

So, if -- if the parties

12

contemplated that the brother would do the work

13

-- if the brother -- if the brother is the one

14

suing, he's likely not bound by the arbitration

15

agreement at all because he won't have been the

16

one to sign it.

17

the one to sign it.

18

The business will have been

If Joe Smith is suing and if -- then

19

the question would be, did the parties

20

contemplate that Joe Smith was agreeing to

21

perform work as a transportation worker, or did

22

the parties contemplate that Joe Smith was

23

agreeing that this company, somebody at this

24

company, would -- would perform work?

25

think that would be the question.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And I

Official - Subject to Final Review
44

And this is a really rare -- as this

2

case shows, where it's undisputed, it's a

3

really rare situation in which it would come

4

up.

5

company agrees to arbitration, then it's hard

6

to say that any individual who wasn't

7

contemplated in the contract would have agreed

8

to arbitration at all.

9

And part of the reason for that is if a

JUSTICE ALITO:

It sort of sounds like

10

what you're saying is that if the person is a

11

real independent contractor, then the person is

12

outside of -- is -- is outside of the

13

exemption, but if the -- if the entity is not a

14

real independent contractor, which is your

15

argument here regarding Mr. Oliveira, it's

16

different.

17

MS. BENNETT:

I -- I'm saying if there

18

are individual workers who are independent

19

contractors, and we know there were such

20

workers in 1925 as now, there are individuals

21

who are independent contractors, even if

22

they're bona fide independent contractors, they

23

would be covered within the scope of the

24

exemption.

25

What I'm saying is if there's an

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

agreement that's not of a specific person, a

2

worker, to perform work, then they're outside

3

the scope.

4

And I want to quickly address one

5

point that Prime said.

6

that none of the sources that we have cited are

7

in the context of distinguishing between

8

independent contractors and common law

9

servants.

10

Prime -- Prime says

And that's, in fact, not true.
We cite dozens of sources that are in

11

that context.

12

is about the law of independent contractors.

13

In fact, we cited treatise that

The reason that's not the majority of

14

sources we've cited is because we've also cited

15

dozens of sources in which -- in a bunch of

16

different contexts.

17

weight of authority in all of these contexts is

18

that a contract of employment was an agreement

19

to perform work.

20

And so the overwhelming

And we were talking about Wisconsin

21

Central before.

What Wisconsin Central says is

22

we look at what the ordinary, common meaning

23

is.

24

common person would have understood this

25

exemption to mean in 1925 is that it applied to

And it's very clear that what an ordinary,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

all agreements to perform work.

2

We don't look at the rare, isolated

3

instance.

We look at the overwhelming weight

4

of authority.

5

agreement is an agreement to perform work.

And that means that the

6

If there are -­

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

Suppose you win on the

8

issue of arbitrability, the court says "I'm

9

going to decide whether the exemption applies,"

10

but then you lose on the issue of the

11

interpretation of the exemption, the court says

12

"it doesn't apply to an independent contractor,

13

Mr. Oliveira's an independent contractor;

14

therefore, I'm going to order arbitration."

15

Would the arbitrator then be bound by

16

the determination that he is an independent

17

contractor for purposes of applying the Fair

18

Labor Standards Act?

19

MS. BENNETT:

No, Your Honor, for two

20

reasons.

21

initial decision of who the right decisionmaker

22

is.

23

decisionmaker is the arbitrator, then the

24

arbitrator could make that decision.

25

First, the -- it would just be an

And if the court held that the right

But the second answer is that if a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
47
1

court were to decide the question of -- if the

2

court were to hold that the exemption only

3

applies to common law servants, then it would

4

likely decide that question under the common

5

law.

6

different standard.

And the Fair Labor Standards Act has a

7

And so the question on the merits of

8

whether a worker is an employee or an

9

independent contractor is different than the

10

question that would be if the court interpreted

11

the exemption to be limited to common law

12

servants.

13

And on that point, I do want to note

14

that Prime cites, you know, a handful of

15

isolated instances, but, in fact, none of the

16

sources that Prime cites, in fact, support its

17

position.

18

look just to the contract to see whether

19

someone is a common law servant.

20

None of those sources say that we

At most, those sources use the phrase

21

"contract of employment" more narrowly than

22

what we would suggest the ordinary meaning is.

23

But none of them say that if there's reality

24

contrary to the contract, we would look at

25

that.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
48
1

And, again, so the -- both the

2

structure of the statute, the text of the

3

statute, and the history, all of those factors

4

mean that, in 1925, the ordinary person would

5

have understood this exemption to apply to all

6

agreements to perform work of transportation

7

workers.

If there are no further questions.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF THEODORE J. BOUTROUS, JR.

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

16
17
18

MR. BOUTROUS:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I want to start by saying we agree

19

with Mr. Oliveira's position that a

20

determination that this was an independent

21

contractor agreement and, therefore, could go

22

to arbitration would not bind the arbitrator.

23

Then we'd go to the merits.

24
25

Since counsel left off with the
language and history of the statute, let me

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

just go back to the statute.

2

"contracts of employment."

3

the Reid case, which is Community for Creative

4

Non-Violence versus Reid, this Court -- this

5

Court said, "Nothing in the text of the work

6

for hire provisions" -- it was the Copyright

7

Act -- "indicates that Congress used the words

8

'employee' and 'employment' to describe

9

anything other than the conventional

10
11

It says
And this Court -­

relationship of an employer and employee."
The Court then went on to say that

12

when Congress hasn't put anything in the

13

statute to suggest that -- something else like

14

any worker doing anything -- I'm paraphrasing

15

-- then we look to traditional common law

16

agency principles.

17

On pages 10 and 11 of our brief, we

18

responded to the -- the cases and authorities

19

that -- that Mr. Oliveira cited with, among

20

other things, this Court -- in the Coppage

21

case, the Court declared "does not the ordinary

22

contract of employment include an insistence by

23

the employer that the employee shall agree, as

24

a condition of the employment, that he will not

25

be idle and will not work for whom he pleases

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

but will serve his present employer, and him

2

only, so long as the relationship between them

3

shall continue."

4

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Was it Coppage v.

5

Kansas, shall not join a union?

6

contract at issue?

7

MR. BOUTROUS:

8

Your Honor.

9

Kansas.

Was that the

I -- I -- I think so,

And it was -- yes, Coppage v.

And -- and so the Court there was

10

clearly making the very distinction we're

11

talking about, that -- that it was well

12

established that a contract of employment was

13

what most people would think:

14

have an employer.

15

They can tell me when I come to work.

16

-- they can order me to perform tasks.

I have a job.

I

They can tell me what to do.

17

That was -­

18

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

They can

But the kind of

19

contract that was involved in Coppage v. Kansas

20

was outlawed by the -- the National Labor

21

Relations Act, wasn't it?

22
23
24
25

MR. BOUTROUS:

Your Honor, the -- I

don't know, Your Honor, on that point, but -­
JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Or Norris-LaGuardia

before that?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

MR. BOUTROUS:

But -- but the -- the

2

-- the reason we cite it, Your Honor, is that

3

it was well established what a contract of

4

employment was.

5

And -- and -- and the -- the other

6

point I wanted to make was on the alternative

7

dispute resolution provisions that Circuit City

8

talked about.

9

respect to each of them, first of all, Congress

Again, the Court said, with

10

with the exemption was not seeking to oust

11

certain parties from arbitration.

12

protecting arbitration because there were

13

alternative mechanisms.

14

It was

So the exemption itself is

15

pro-arbitration.

And in Circuit City, on page

16

120, 121, with respect to each of the

17

provisions it cited, the Court talked about

18

employment relationships, so with respect to

19

the Transportation Act that -- that counsel

20

mentioned; it talked about the employees under

21

the federal law, cited the Transportation Act;

22

Railway Labor Act, employees; the Shipping

23

Commissioner Act, employers and employees.

24

this Court and Congress were anticipating the

25

traditional employment relationship based on

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

the language of the statute.

2

And with respect to the scope of the

3

provision, in this case, the independent

4

contractor agreement is between New Prime and

5

the limited liability corporation that

6

Mr. Oliveira formed.

7

between two businesses.

So it is an agreement

8

And counsel's saying then we have to

9

look and see how the parties contemplated the

10

arrangement would function.

11

itself says that Mr. Oliveira could hire other

12

employees, could work for other entities.

13

gave him the right to do that.

14

face of the contract, it -- it gave him all of

15

those -- those rights.

16

But the agreement

It

So, from the

And -- and, finally, just with respect

17

to the definition of, you know, who's an

18

employee and who's not, because I do think it's

19

relevant.

20

-- what Mr. Oliveira did was take the word

21

"contract" and find the broadest definition of

22

contract; and then "employment," and find the

23

broadest definition of that and put them

24

together.

25

To divorce -- what -- what counsel

We cite Black's Law Dictionary, which

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

says, "A contract of employment," and this -­

2

tracking it back to 1927 -- "was an agreement

3

between an employer and an employee that states

4

the terms and conditions of employment."

5

But the broadest, this Court has said,

6

has striking breath -- breadth.

The broadest

7

definition in federal law of employees, in the

8

Fair Labor Standards Act, the very provision

9

that Mr. Oliveira is invoking here, and

10

independent contractors are not covered by that

11

definition.

12
13

So it would be anomalous in the
extreme to rule against us on these issues.

14

Thank you very much.
