Mr. Shanmugam.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K. SHANMUGAM

11

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
In the America Invents Act, Congress

12

transformed the nation's patent laws.

As part

13

of its shift from a first-to-invent to a

14

first-to-file system, Congress revised the

15

definition of "prior art" and clarified the

16

proper understanding of the phrase "on sale."

17

The on-sale bar, like the other bars

18

in the definition, reaches only a disclosure

19

that makes the claimed invention available to

20

the public.

21

with the plain text of the definition and its

22

legislative history.

23

predominant objective of the on-sale bar as

24

repeatedly articulated by this Court; namely,

25

to preserve the public's access to inventions

That interpretation is consistent

It's consistent with the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

that have entered the public domain.

2

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, it might

3

not be consistent with the actual meaning of

4

the word "sale," though, right?

5

MR. SHANMUGAM:

The critical phrase -­

6

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

If you're

7

having -- if you're -- if something's on sale,

8

it doesn't have to be on sale to everybody.

9

could be just I'm going to sell something to

10
11

It

you.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Well, the critical

12

phrase, Mr. Chief Justice, is not "sale."

13

is "on sale."

14

natural understanding of "on sale" is that

15

something has been made available for purchase

16

by the public.

17

It

And I do think that the more

And so, for instance, if after this

18

argument in the lawyers lounge I turn to my

19

friend, Mr. Jay, and I say, I see that you

20

didn't bring a coat today, I'll sell you my

21

coat for $5, I'm not sure that that would be

22

putting my coat on sale in the same way that it

23

would be if I turned around to the audience and

24

said I'll sell this coat to the highest bidder.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Why not?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I don't

Official - Subject to Final Review
5
1

-- and if it's sold, it's pretty hard to say

2

something that has been sold was not on sale.

3

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think that the

4

concept of "on sale," Justice Kavanaugh,

5

conveys some sense of broader availability or,

6

at a minimum, that there's some ambiguity about

7

that.

8
9

That is to say, I think I'm willing to
recognize that perhaps you could make the

10

argument that even offering something privately

11

to one person could be said to be putting

12

something on sale.

13
14

Our view as a textual matter is that
to the extent that there's any ambiguity -­

15

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Isn't it always

16

the case that if you offer it to even one

17

person or to a small group of people, it's on

18

sale?

19
20
21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think that I

would -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

22

not understanding that.

23

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I -- I guess I'm

I think I would say,

24

Justice Kavanaugh, that something can be on

25

sale regardless of how widely it is, in fact,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

sold.

2

in the shop window and no one, in fact, wants

3

to buy it and no one, in fact, buys it, it can

4

still be on sale.

5

So, for instance, if you put something

But, again, to the extent that there's

6

any doubt about the phrase "on sale" in vacuo,

7

I think that that doubt probably was eliminated

8

before the AIA by the surrounding phrases, all

9

of which, by Respondents' recognition, convey

10
11

some notion of public availability.
And then any lingering doubt was

12

completely removed by the inclusion of the

13

catch-all phrase in the AIA.

14

JUSTICE BREYER:

You said that the

15

opinions of this Court support you, but, of

16

course, you know perfectly well is you have -­

17

we only have Justice Story, Learned Hand, and I

18

guess various others, maybe John Marshall for

19

all I know, who -- who -- who said that that

20

isn't the sole purpose, that the purpose of

21

this on-sale rule including private sales is to

22

prevent people from benefiting from their

23

invention prior to and beyond the 20 years that

24

they're allowed.

25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

JUSTICE BREYER:

And -- and that's -­

2

so I read that, I had my clerk look it up,

3

seems right.

4

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Justice Breyer,

5

Respondents' whole argument before this Court,

6

I would respectfully submit, is really a junior

7

varsity version of congressional ratification.

8

No fewer than six times in their brief they

9

refer to the two centuries of precedent.

10

JUSTICE BREYER:

11

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Uh-huh.
I would respectfully

12

vigorously disagree with that, particularly

13

with regard to this Court's decisions.

14

me get to Judge Hand, but let me start with

15

this Court's decisions, starting with Justice

16

Story's opinion in Pennock.

17

And let

This Court has consistently

18

articulated the predominant purpose of the

19

on-sale bar as preserving the public's access

20

to inventions that have entered the public

21

domain.

22

Indeed, if you go back to Pennock,

23

Justice Story, at a time when the on-sale bar

24

was not yet codified in the statute,

25

articulated the purpose in precisely that term

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

both with regard to the public use bar and with

2

regard to the on-sale bar.

3

inventor shall put the invention into public

4

use or sell it for public use before he applies

5

for a patent, this shall furnish another bar to

6

his claim.

7

He said, if the

And all the way through to this

8

Court's decision in Pfaff, this Court has

9

referred to "the reluctance to allow an

10

inventor to remove existing knowledge from

11

public use" and has said that that purpose

12

undergirds the on-sale bar.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

14

And I -­
Doesn't commercial

exploit -- exploitation also undergird the bar?

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I don't think we would

16

dispute that that is one way of characterizing

17

the underlying purpose, and that is what Judge

18

Hand said in the Metallizing opinion.

19
20

JUSTICE BREYER:
can all be secret.

It's not very hard.

21

MR. SHANMUGAM:

22

JUSTICE BREYER:

23

And, of course, that

But I don't think -­
You have an invention

--

24

MR. SHANMUGAM:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I think to -­
-- that is practiced

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

-- well, I'm looking at the word "practice."

2

And it's not just one word.

3

practicing the invention.

4

the invention in such a way that the user of

5

the invention can't find out what the invention

6

is.

And you can practice

That's not uncommon.

7

MR. SHANMUGAM:

8

JUSTICE BREYER:

9

It's also

Let me say -­
And, therefore, we

have two that do not involve the public

10

awareness of the invention itself or how it is

11

produced.

12

MR. SHANMUGAM:

So let me say just one

13

last thing about this Court's decisions and

14

then address that concern directly.

15

I think that if you were to adopt our

16

interpretation under which public availability

17

is required to trigger the on-sale bar, just

18

like all of the other bars, you would not have

19

to discard any of the reasoning of this Court's

20

cases and you wouldn't have to change any of

21

the outcomes of this Court's cases.

22

that all of this Court's cases on their facts

23

would come out the same way.

24
25

We believe

Now, with regard to this alternative
formulation of the purpose, which I think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1

really first appeared prominently in Judge

2

Hand's opinion in Metallizing and then did -­

3

did get picked up in a couple of this Court's

4

decisions, I'm willing to accept that, when you

5

have a sale, there is obviously a commercial

6

aspect to that.

7

receives some consideration in response to

8

that.

9

The person who sells the item

But I don't think it's fair to say

10

that what Judge Hand was doing was saying that

11

the on-sale bar reaches all forms of pre-patent

12

commercialization.

13

over-reading of the on-sale bar.

14

I think that that is an

And I think that, critically, even our

15

interpretation of the on-sale bar obviously

16

substantially limits an inventor's ability to

17

profit from his or her invention because, if

18

you do have public availability and a sale,

19

that is still going to be prohibited.

20
21
22

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Shanmugam, is

it -­
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Our submission is

23

simply that the statute -­

24

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

25

would you please clarify one thing?

-- may -- may -­
I -- I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11

thought that one argument was that the AIA

2

changed the way it was.

3

"on sale" seems to apply -- you seem to say

4

there was no change; "on sale" never included

5

the secret sale.

6

MR. SHANMUGAM:

But your definition of

Justice Ginsburg, as I

7

said at the outset, I think that what Congress

8

did in the AIA was to clarify the proper

9

understanding of the phrase.

And I do think

10

that at least our argument concerning the

11

noscitur a sociis canon would still have

12

applied even before the AIA.

13

have the addition of the catch-all phrase.

14

Obviously, we

And I think, under this Court's

15

decisions construing materially identical

16

language, catch-all provisions do shed light on

17

the meaning of the categories that precede

18

them.

But in our view -­

19

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

20

MR. SHANMUGAM:

21
22

If that was a -­

-- in terms of what

the -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- if that was a

23

clarification, it was a terrible clarification

24

because there were a lot of efforts, as you

25

well know, to actually change the "on sale"

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1
2

language, and those all failed.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

I think, in fairness,

3

Justice Kavanaugh, I would say that this was

4

exactly the way to achieve Congress's dual

5

objective.

6

First -­

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You don't think it

7

would have been easier to just change it

8

directly, as many members of Congress tried to

9

do repeatedly and failed?

10

MR. SHANMUGAM:

I -- I think that that

11

is, with respect, an overstatement of what

12

members of Congress tried to do.

13

at most, as Respondents point out, there were

14

bills that would have deleted "public use" and

15

"on sale" from the definition.

16

I think that,

But I think that there was good

17

reason, actually, to retain those phrases.

18

the legislative history to which -- to which

19

Respondents point suggests, there was a

20

surrounding jurisprudence concerning these

21

terms which Congress may have wanted to retain,

22

things like the ready for patenting

23

requirement.

24
25

As

Retaining those phrases also made
clear that where the inventive embodiment is in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
13
1

the public domain, the statute reaches those

2

cases no differently from when the inventive

3

idea is in the public domain.

4

What Congress was trying to do in the

5

catch-all provision -- and the House and Senate

6

reports, the most definitive form of

7

legislative history, bear this out -- was to

8

achieve two objectives:

9

reached all forms of prior art, such as oral

10

presentations, PowerPoint presentations, and

11

the like, and also to clarify that any form of

12

prior art must be publicly available.

13

to make sure that they

And notably -- and this gets to

14

Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there

15

was a change in the law -- I do think that what

16

Congress was doing was abrogating some of the

17

outlying lower court decisions that had

18

extended both the on-sale bar and the public

19

use bar to cases where there was not public

20

availability.

21

And, indeed, the legislative history

22

identifies by name some of the public use cases

23

that had so held, cases like the Beachcombers

24

decision from the Federal Circuit and the

25

JumpSport decision.

We also point to some of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

the on-sale cases that had extended to sales

2

that did not involve public availability, cases

3

like Special Devices and Caveney.

4

And I think, Justice Kavanaugh, that

5

that's precisely why you should think that what

6

Congress did here was fit for a purpose.

7

I think we would certainly acknowledge

8

that Congress could have modified the language

9

of "on sale," but what Congress wanted to do,

10

we would respectfully submit, was also to fix

11

some of this outlying Federal Circuit case law

12

on public use.

13

Now, of course, that phrase "public

14

use" one might think would have inherently

15

conveyed some notion of public availability, as

16

Respondents themselves suggest in their brief.

17

But, at the same time, you had the Federal

18

Circuit extending the public use bar to

19

circumstances in which inventions were

20

displayed, and private parties, the JumpSport

21

case involved a trampoline in the inventor's

22

backyard.

23

there would not have been public availability.

24
25

These were cases where, in our view,

And so Congress, in including the
catch-all provision, did what Congress did in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

cases like Seatrain Lines and Paroline.

2

shed light on the meaning of the pre-existing

3

specified provisions, and to be sure, in those

4

cases, everything was enacted at the same time,

5

but, as a textual matter, you have to read the

6

statute as a whole.

7

It

And, again, Respondents' argument here

8

really rests on this notion of congressional

9

ratification.

The first part of that is the

10

part that I've already addressed, this notion

11

that there was some settled body of law saying

12

that you don't have to have public

13

availability.

14

never say that, this Court never did that.

And not only did this Court

15

But, of course, the second component

16

of any congressional ratification argument is

17

that you have to have statutory language that

18

was not changed.

19

dramatically revised and, to be sure, some

20

elements of the pre-AIA definition, including

21

the phrase "on sale," were retained, but at the

22

same time, Congress added the catch-all phrase.

23

It defined a claimed invention.

24

course, it shifted to a first-to-file system,

25

which largely addresses this concern about

And this provision was

And, of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

improper commercialization because, of course,

2

any inventor who engages in commercial activity

3

without applying in a first-to-file system runs

4

the risk that another inventor will beat them

5

to the Patent Office.

6

And that is a concern, I would

7

respectfully submit, that is particularly acute

8

in a context like this.

9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

On -- on the first

10

part of what you just said as to what the law

11

was, the amicus brief, the Lemley amicus brief

12

says the law has always treated secret sales

13

and uses as prior art.

14

with that?

15

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Are you disagreeing

I am disagreeing with

16

that.

17

government can offer its view with the

18

institutional heft of the Patent Office -­

19

there is no decision of this Court that would

20

have to be disturbed.

21

And, again, in our view -- and the

In our view, there are a handful of

22

Federal Circuit cases that would come out

23

differently if a public availability

24

requirement is applied.

25

And I want to say one more -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

JUSTICE BREYER:

What about Bonito

2

Boats?

3

while it isn't necessary for the holding, does

4

quote Learned Hand, and it does say it is a

5

condition upon the inventor's right to a patent

6

that he shall not exploit his discovery

7

competitively after it is ready for patenting.

8

He has to go ahead and patent it or keep it a

9

secret forever.

10

I mean, in Bonito Boats, this Court,

So an inventor who, in fact, in year

11

one has his invention ready for patenting, and

12

goes around from one person to another secretly

13

selling it to each with a confidentiality

14

agreement, is a person who is exploiting his

15

agreement -- his invention, and, therefore,

16

since he didn't do it through a patent, he

17

loses the right for a patent.

18

That seemed to me the clear -- pretty

19

clear rationale of Learned Hand, of why the

20

Court did that in Bonito Boats, of why Justice

21

Story said what he said, and I think it's that

22

that the Lemley brief was relying upon when

23

they made that statement.

24
25

MR. SHANMUGAM:

We are not disagreeing

that that can be fairly read to be a purpose of

modest one.

3

Respondents' submission, you have to think that

4

the on-sale bar really pursues that purpose at

5

all costs.

6

My submission is a much more

It is that, in order to accept

And part of the reason why we know

7

that that is not true is because Respondents

8

themselves concede that, if this arrangement

had been structured slightly differently, if

10

this had been structured as a right to profit

11

sharing rather than a -- a structure where you

12

have upfront payments followed by payments per

unit for any eventual product, if there even is

20

It's not the

There are experimental exceptions, for

21

example, and perhaps there should be other, if

22

not exceptions, at least care taken to be

23

certain that it is an exploitation of the

invention when it is a private sale.

25

I mean, to go that far seems

Yes.
I mean, I think that

17

we think that this Court should correct the

18

Federal Circuit's error, which is to say that

19

public availability is not required.

20

Now Respondents, we believe, have

21

forfeited any argument that there is public

22

availability here.

23

would be an easy case under a public

24

availability requirement, both because this

25

involved a sale to a single distributor, MGI,

But we also think that this

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
20
1

that was under an obligation of

2

confidentiality, and also because this was a

3

development arrangement of which distribution

4

was an eventual possible part.

5

There was not even a product at the

6

time of this arrangement.

7

think that this would be an easy case under a

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MALCOLM L. STEWART

15

FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE,

16

SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER

17
18

MR. STEWART:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

19

In the government's view, there are

20

two basic reasons that the transaction at issue

21

here shouldn't be held to trigger the on-sale

22

bar.

23

intended to use the drug for its -- that

24

planned to use the drug for its intended

25

purpose by administering it to patients.

First, MGI was not a company that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MGI

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

proposed to function as a financial

2

intermediary that would take title to the

3

Palonosetron but ultimately would resell it.

4

And, second, even as to MGI itself,

5

the transaction did not provide any assurance

6

that title would ultimately pass because the

7

terms of the deal were subject to various

8

contingencies.

9

the first point first.

And I'd like to focus on the -­

10

None of this -- none of the Court's

11

decisions in either the public use or the -­

12

the on-sale bar apply -- holding those bars to

13

apply have dealt with situations involving

14

distribution intermediaries.

15

one of those cases have involved fact patterns

16

in which the invention was actually out there

17

in the world being used for its intended

18

purposes, and that was what was held to trigger

19

the on-sale or the public use bar.

All -- all but

20

The only exception to that is Pfaff,

21

because Pfaff involved an offer for sale that

22

had not yet been consummated, and the Court

23

held that the bar was triggered even though the

24

invention had not yet been supplied.

25

But even in Pfaff, you had a firm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22
1

offer to Texas Instruments that proposed -­

2

that intended to use the component for its

3

ultimate purposes to be incorporated into

4

larger machines.

5

that intended to buy the product solely for

6

resale.

7

You didn't have an entity

And -- and I think in terms of how do

8

we usually understand phrases like "on sale" or

9

"available to the public," our reading really

10

conforms much more closely to usual public

11

practices.

12

with a new product like an iPhone, it's

13

manufactured.

14

wholesaler sells it to a retailer.

15

the retailer sells it to consumers.

16

train of transactions that constitute UCC

17

sales.

That is, if you imagine a situation

It's sold to a wholesaler.

The

And then
There's a

18

But, if you ask an ordinary speaker of

19

the language at what point did the iPhone go on

20

sale or become available to the public, you

21

would say that it's when consumers could buy

22

it, when the people who planned to use the

23

phone for its intended purpose -­

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:
consumer.

If you ask a

But if you ask in the industry to

distributors, they'll say the moment that Apple

2

was going to start shipping it to distributors.

MR. STEWART:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

That I didn't win

5

is irrelevant to me.

distributors were going to pick it up and ship

it out.

It was on sale the moment

MR. STEWART:

You -- you might use a

phrase like "on sale to distributors" or "on

10

sale to resalers" -- "resellers," but I don't

11

think you would use the phrase "on sale"

12

standing alone.

13

to describe the phone as being made available

14

to the public at the time that Apple was

15

accepting bids as to who could -­

16

And it would certainly be odd

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

This definition of

17

"on sale," to be frank with you, I've looked at

18

the history cited in the briefs, I looked at

19

the cases, I don't find it anywhere.

20

You're sort of giving "on sale to the

21

public" its meaning, but those are not the

22

words used by Congress.

23

said "on sale to the public."

24

might have to grapple with this.

25

said "on sale."

Congress could have

MR. STEWART:

It said -- it retained

the phrase "on sale," but it added the phrase

"or otherwise available to the public."

that served two purposes.

It functioned as a catch-all so that

MR. STEWART:

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Doesn't that

I'm sorry?
If that phrase has

17

an independent meaning, and you've just given

18

it two, then why don't we take the words

19

Congress used with their history?

20

didn't say "on sale to the public"; they just

21

said "on sale."

22

term that has a history, as a matter of course,

23

we look at that history.

24
25

Because they

And when you have a historical

MR. STEWART:

I -- I think it's

certainly appropriate to -- to look to the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

Court's -- to -- to the history, in particular

2

to this -- particularly to this Court's prior

3

decisions.

4

held the on-sale bar to be applicable to sales

5

to distribution intermediaries, then we might

6

say this is a fairly oblique way of overturning

7

those decisions.

And if this Court had previously

8

Our -- our key point is this Court -­

9

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So is that right?

If

10

-- if -- if you assume for a moment that the

11

law was pretty settled before the AIA, then do

12

you think that the AIA would -- that the

13

language added in the AIA would have been

14

capable of flipping that settled law?

15

MR. STEWART:

If you thought it was

16

settled by this Court's decisions that the

17

on-sale bar applied to this sort -­

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

How about if I say it

19

was settled because this Court had decided

20

Pfaff and because the Federal Circuit had a

21

number of cases?

22

MR. STEWART:

I -- I don't think

23

that's sufficient to treat the law as settled,

24

especially because there is evidence both from

25

the face of the statute, the fact that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

"otherwise available to the public" was added,

2

also from the legislative history, that

3

Congress was attempting to clarify that the

4

enumerated terms were ways of making the

5

invention available to the public.

6

I mean, the other thing I would say to

7

-- to follow up on something that my -- my

8

colleague mentioned is that one of the

9

justifications for the on-sale bar

10

traditionally has been prevent the inventor

11

from profiting before he is ready to put his

12

invention up for patent.

13

And that justification -- that

14

justification is neither sufficient nor

15

necessary on Respondents' view of the case.

16

That is, as Mr. Shanmugam pointed out,

17

Respondents themselves agree that there are

18

other transactions by which Helsinn could have

19

gotten money up front, could have gotten seed

20

money in return, for instance, for promising a

21

share of the profits.

22

triggered the on-sale bar.

23

Those would not have

The other thing is that, in the

24

Federal Circuit's decisions, it's not even

25

necessary that the inventor profit from the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

sale in order for the -- the on-sale bar to

2

apply.

3

patterns in which the inventor will ask an

4

outside supplier to produce physical

5

embodiments of the invention and deliver those

6

to the inventor.

7

The Federal Circuit has confronted fact

Obviously, the inventor is not

8

profiting from that.

The inventor is paying

9

money for the production.

And the court -- the

10

Federal Circuit has said that triggers the -­

11

that at least potentially triggers the on-sale

12

bar -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MR. STEWART:

15
16

So -­
-- because there's a UCC

sale.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, Mr. Stewart, I'm

17

going to ask you to accept my assumption, and

18

it's a big assumption, I realize that.

19

just accept the assumption that the law was

20

settled prior to the AIA and it was settled

21

Mr. Jay's way, not your way.

22

But

Then is the new language that the AIA

23

put in the statute -- would that be enough to

24

unsettle it?

25

MR. STEWART:

No, I think that would

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

be a fairly oblique way of attempting to

2

overturn kind of a settled body of law.

3

as I say, the -- the body of law that the

4

Federal Circuit has developed doesn't map onto

5

any policy justification.

6

But,

The other thing I would say about

7

Pfaff is that, in Pfaff, the Court emphasized

8

that the sale was what it referred to as a

9

commercial sale rather than an experimental

10

sale.

And the Court at some length discussed

11

the body of cases involving the experimental

12

use doctrine and the -­

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

14

MR. STEWART:

15

You -­

I'm sorry, Justice

Kavanaugh?

16

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

17

MR. STEWART:

Go ahead.

And the -- the Court has

18

recognized that even when an invention is being

19

used out in the public square in a manner that

20

is visible to the public, it's not the sort of

21

public use that triggers the public use bar if

22

it is being done for experimental purposes, to

23

verify that the invention will work as a stage

24

precedent to patenting.

25

And the Court in Pfaff strongly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

indicated, if a sale is made so that the buyer

2

can engage in experimentation, rather than to

3

use the product to achieve its intended

4

benefits, that won't trigger the on-sale bar.

5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You -- you

6

mentioned the legislative history, but, here,

7

isn't this a classic example of trying to

8

snatch victory from defeat in some of the

9

legislative statements?

10

In other words, there was this law

11

before, as Justice Kagan mentions, a huge

12

effort to change it, lots of proposals to

13

change it.

14

statements said on the floor on which you're

15

relying.

16

read as a whole, goes exactly contrary.

17
18
19
20
21

They all fail, and then a couple

I -- I think the legislative history,

MR. STEWART:

Well, to answer that,

let me point to -- to one of the things -­
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

What's wrong with

thinking that way?
MR. STEWART:

I think what's wrong

22

with thinking that way is that, as we've

23

pointed out in our brief, the -- the prior art

24

provision encompasses two conceptually distinct

25

ways of placing an invention in the public

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1
2

domain.
If the invention is patented or

3

described in a printed publication, that means

4

that the inventive idea has been made available

5

to persons skilled in the art such that they

6

would be able to make it.

7

and public use bars deal with situations in

8

which physical embodiments of the invention had

9

been placed in the -- the public domain.

10

And the on-sale bar

Now some of the proposals that you

11

refer to, Justice Kavanaugh, would have said

12

things to the effect of it has been patented -­

13

patented, described in a printed publication,

14

or otherwise available to the public.

15

I think, if that language had been

16

used and there had been no reference to on sale

17

or public use, it would have been at least a

18

permissible inference that the "otherwise

19

available to the public" referred solely to

20

circumstances in which the inventive idea had

21

been disclosed.

22

And that would have -- that really

23

would have overturned a great deal of this

24

Court's law concerning the on-sale and public

25

use bars because those can be triggered even if

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

the public is not aware of how the invention

2

works, so long as physical body -- embodiments

3

have been made available.

4

So I think Congress got the best of

5

both worlds by -- by clarifying that all these

6

things have to be public in some manner, but

7

also clarifying that making physical

8

embodiments available is sufficient.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF WILLIAM M. JAY

13

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

14
15

Thank you,

MR. JAY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

16

A product that is sold or offered for

17

commercial sale is on sale, as this Court has

18

consistently read that term.

19

meaning didn't change when Congress added a new

20

category of invalidating prior art to the

21

statute.

22

available to the public in other ways not

23

already covered by the statute.

24
25

That established

That's events that make the invention

So Helsinn's argument, as you heard
this morning, is that although it sold its

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

invention, that sale did not place the

2

invention on sale.

3

Helsinn place the invention on sale, it also

4

made the invention available to the public.

5

We submit that not only did

But I'd like to begin with first the

6

plain meaning of "on sale."

We think that the

7

reason that the statute uses "on sale" and that

8

this Court has always read it this way,

9

including in Pfaff, is to cover offers for

10

sale.

11

sales, then it wouldn't cover offers.

12

offers are important for two important reasons

13

-- for two key reasons.

14

If it just -- if the statute simply said
And

One, an offer shows -- the willingness

15

to place the invention on sale, to make an

16

offer to sell the product, shows that the

17

inventor is ready to commercialize the

18

invention.

19

commercialize the invention, and then the

20

second half of the Pfaff test is met, the

21

invention itself is ready for patenting, then

22

the inventor ought to be going to the Patent

23

Office and applying for a patent.

24
25

And if they're ready to

If instead the inventor wants to
commercialize the invention, deriving profit

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

from it, then the inventor can do that but

2

should not expect a legal monopoly that could

3

extend past the statutory term.

4

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, I think the most

5

serious argument you have to deal with is the

6

meaning -- the plain meaning -- the fairly

7

plain meaning of the new statutory language.

8
9

So you say "on sale" means on sale
publicly or on sale privately, right?

10

MR. JAY:

11

JUSTICE ALITO:

12

MR. JAY:

13
14

Right.

On -­
All right.

-- on sale, period, full

stop.
JUSTICE ALITO:

Okay.

So suppose that

15

the statute had been amended to read just the

16

way it does, except -- so it would -- with one

17

exception.

18

invention was patented, described in a printed

19

publication, or in public use, on sale publicly

20

or on sale privately, or otherwise available to

21

the public.

So it says the claim -- the claimed

22

That would be nonsense, wouldn't it?

23

MR. JAY:

I -- I think it would be

24

confusing.

That -- that's certainly right.

25

But I do think that it would specify that one

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

of the categories of invalidating prior art

2

would be on sale privately.

3

And in your hypothetical, I think this

4

Court would give effect to the choice that

5

Congress made, even though one of the items in

6

the list might stick out somewhat and not -­

7

JUSTICE ALITO:

It would be -- it

8

would be nonsense because the meaning of

9

"otherwise" is in the same -- in some other

10

manner, to do the same thing in some other

11

manner.

12

And you have -- what we have now after

13

this change is an enumerated -- is an

14

enumeration of a number of things that are

15

public, a printed publication in public use,

16

two things that are obviously public.

17

Then we have on sale.

And then it

18

says, "or otherwise available to the public."

19

And I find it very difficult to get over the

20

idea that this means that all of the things

21

that went before are public.

22

MR. JAY:

23

JUSTICE ALITO:

24
25

So two points.

Of course -­

That's what

"otherwise" means.
MR. JAY:

So, of course, you know,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

Your Honor sort of asked me to assume that this

2

is a statute that's being written from scratch,

3

and I think that that takes off the table all

4

of the history of the statute as it was before

5

2011.

6

But, second, even taking -- even

7

taking that off the table and looking at the

8

statute, a statute like the one that you've

9

proposed, the reason that your example is

10

different from this statute is that, in your

11

example, there's one category, on sale

12

privately, that doesn't even have any overlap

13

with available to the public.

14

And we've never disputed that many

15

sales do, in fact, make inventions available to

16

the public.

17

its own meaning, and one important part of that

18

meaning is offers.

19

But we do think that "on sale" has

And we think that structurally, if "on

20

sale" is to include offers, and we think there

21

is no way to read that definition to exclude

22

offers, offers are not generally going to make

23

an invention available to the public.

24
25

My friends on the other side in their
brief suggest that that might happen in a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

newspaper advertisement.

2

unusual to see in a newspaper advertisement all

3

of the details of a claimed invention

4

disclosed.

5

But it's extremely

So we think that the function of

6

"otherwise" in the statute as amended, again,

7

even taking off the table all of the history,

8

is to acknowledge that there is overlap between

9

the previous four categories and the new

10

category of invalidating prior art that's being

11

added, so as to make sure that the new category

12

doesn't swallow or change the meaning of a

13

prior one.

14
15
16
17
18

Let me illustrate that with an
example.
JUSTICE ALITO:

So -- so the new

category consists of offers?
MR. JAY:

The new -- sorry, the new

19

category consists of things that make the -­

20

that otherwise make the invention available to

21

the public.

22
23
24
25

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what would be

within that category?
MR. JAY:

An oral presentation at a

conference without slides, you know, PowerPoint

Official - Subject to Final Review

slides that get distributed.

2

example.

3

Tech Inventors Alliance brief is collaboration

4

among many people on an app -- an app -- a

5

collaboration app which is not on the Internet

6

and is not indexed and would not count as a

7

printed publication but ought to be the kind of

8

disclosure.

9

That's one

Another that's discussed in the High

I mean, the government agrees with us,

10

and I think, by the end of the briefing,

11

Respondent -- Petitioner has agreed with us

12

that this new category's primary function is to

13

create new invalidating prior art disclosures

14

that weren't invalidating before the AIA.

15

And we think that it would be strange

16

for Congress, by creating a new invalidating

17

category, in other words, narrowing the scope

18

of things that could be patentable, to

19

indirectly and by the -- the strangest

20

implication, narrow a category of prior art and

21

widen the scope of things that could be

22

patented.

23

I think it's -- as a historical matter

24

about this case, I think it's important to

25

understand that Petitioner had gotten three

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

patents before the AIA, all of which were

2

invalidated below.

3

sought cert on that, and, indeed, told this

4

Court at page 3 of the reply brief that it

5

could assume that that decision was correct

6

under the -- under the prior interpretation of

7

the AIA -- I'm sorry, of the "on sale" words.

And Petitioner hasn't

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

MR. JAY:

10

Mr. Jay -­

Yes.

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- you were cut

11

off before you gave an example.

I wasn't quite

12

moved by your baseball example.

So do you have

13

something else in something that's based in law

14

where "otherwise" was used in the way you

15

suggest?

16

And the second part of my question is,

17

will we be the only country that has a

18

first-to-file system that includes private

19

sales?

20
21

MR. JAY:

So let me answer the second

part first -­

22

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

23

MR. JAY:

Confidential-wise.

-- just because I think -- I

24

think -- I think it's a pretty straightforward

25

answer.

The on-sale bar itself is unique.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

The

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

other -- other countries don't have an on-sale

2

bar that includes public sales.

3

don't have an on-sale bar at all.

4

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

They just
So -­

I'm sorry.

5

Explain that to me, an on sale -- no -- there

6

is no on-sale bar -­

7

MR. JAY:

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

9

Right.
-- public or

private?

10

MR. JAY:

Right.

Sales are not a

11

category in the other countries' patent systems

12

that are discussed in the briefing.

13

made is that those countries don't rely on

14

secret prior art, but they also don't have an

15

on-sale bar at all.

16

The point

So, in this country, we have and have

17

decided -- and Congress has decided to retain a

18

category of invalidating prior art that -- that

19

-- that has, as the purpose, measuring whether

20

the inventor is commercializing the invention,

21

is ready to commercialize the invention, an

22

invention that, under the second half of the

23

test, is ready for patenting.

24
25

So -- so that is itself somewhat
unique.

And I think that's the answer to why

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1
2

you don't see this in other countries.
On -- on your -- on the first question

3

you asked, Your Honor, what I was getting to

4

with -- with Justice Alito about the -- the

5

addition of "otherwise available to the

6

public," rather than just "available to the

7

public," we think the word "otherwise" serves

8

to acknowledge that there is overlap and to

9

avoid this strange situation.

10

So, if the statute had said described

11

in a printed publication, dot, dot, dot, or

12

available to the public, one implication of

13

that might be, if there weren't a clarifying

14

word like "otherwise" to make clear that that

15

new category was a residual category intended

16

to catch things not already caught, the

17

implication might be that, well, gosh, in order

18

to give content to the other items in the list,

19

we better read them to include things that are

20

not available to the public, such as printed

21

publications that are not indexed, that are not

22

available to the public.

23

There is a lengthy -- an extensive

24

body of law on that.

So, for example, a Ph.D.

25

thesis that's on a shelf somewhere but is not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

indexed and not readily findable does not count

2

as a printed publication.

3

We think that the best reading of this

4

new category is that it creates a new set of

5

invalidating prior art and it does not unsettle

6

any of the prior categories, whether patented,

7

described in a printed publication, in public

8

use, or on sale.

9

And it certainly doesn't -- doesn't

10

disturb the basic policy justification for the

11

on-sale bar, which deals not with the stock of

12

public knowledge, precisely because, as my

13

friend, Mr. Shanmugam, and my friend, Mr.

14

Stewart, have both -- have both discussed,

15

putting an embodiment out in the public or even

16

offering to put an embodiment of the invention

17

out in -- in the public for money, meaning on

18

sale, that may not tell the public anything

19

about how the invention works.

20

JUSTICE BREYER:

Can -- can you answer

21

Justice Alito's and Justice Sotomayor's first

22

question?

23

but they're a little awkward.

24

meet, the sports meet will include football,

25

basketball, running, swimming, or otherwise -­

That is, I can think of examples,
I mean, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

or games that otherwise involve a ball, okay?

2

Or breakfast, a healthy breakfast

3

includes Fiber One bran flakes, fruit, tea, and

4

food that otherwise is a -- what do you -­

5

fiber heavy, you see.

6

is somewhat awkward, each of the ones.

7

But -- but each of those

So it's possible among these excellent

8

briefs -- I thought the bar really earned its

9

pay on both sides -- but, I mean, the -- the -­

10

the -- I -- I couldn't come up with a good

11

English example there.

12

maybe you have.

13
14

MR. JAY:

So I actually -- and thank

you, Your Honor.

15

(Laughter.)

16

MR. JAY:

17

The -- the example that we

thought of actually is -- is -­

18
19

So I thought maybe -­

JUSTICE BREYER:

There were an awful

lot of them.

20

MR. JAY:

There are -- is very close

21

to your -- your football, baseball, swimming

22

example.

23

statute said, you know, don't engage in

24

football, baseball, or swimming, full stop, I

25

think everyone would understand what football

And I think, in particular, that if a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

and baseball and swimming meant.

2

And if the -- if the statute were then

3

amended to add "or any other activity that

4

involves the use of a ball," that might be a

5

bit awkward, but no one would think that it

6

changed the meaning of swimming, that it

7

required the adoption of a atextual meaning of

8

swimming that doesn't appear in any dictionary,

9

or that it required anything, other than the

10

addition of -­

11
12

JUSTICE KAGAN:
another one.

13
14

Well, I'll give you

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it would be

JUSTICE KAGAN:

I'll give you another

nonsense.

15
16

one, Mr. Jay.

17

peanut butter cookies, pecan pie -- this is the

18

key one, ready -- brownies, or any dessert that

19

otherwise contains nuts.

20

the injunction if I buy nutless brownies?

21

So suppose I say don't buy

MR. JAY:

Do I -- do I violate

So I think that the reason

22

that that hypothetical -- so I think I would

23

say no.

24

if you -­

25

Do I -- do you violate the injunction

JUSTICE KAGAN:

In other words, can I

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
44
1

buy nutless brownies?

2

MR. JAY:

I think so -- I think you

3

can.

4

for that is that "brownies" is a -- is a term

5

that might or might not, you know, be read to

6

include brownies with nuts or -- or -- or

7

brownies otherwise.

8
9
10

And I think that the reason -- the reason

But I don't think that you have that
permissible reading of "on sale" here.

And, in

addition -­

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

You're saying it's not

12

even like a little bit doubtful what "on sale"

13

means?

14

MR. JAY:

Certainly not by the time

15

the AIA was -- was enacted, no, I don't think

16

that it was.

17

doubtful by -- by any dictionary that we found,

18

either when the bar was enacted or when it was

19

recodified in 1952, or when it was reenacted in

20

2011.

21

it's a permissible reading.

22
23

I don't think that it was

So -- so, no, I don't -- I don't think

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And in your -­

Because, in Mr.

Shanmugam's excellent brief, he -­

24

(Laughter.)

25

JUSTICE KAGAN:

-- he certainly seems

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

to think that "on sale" means something

2

different from what you thought it meant.

3

I guess what my hypothetical is designed to do

4

is to say, look, let's take a term that could

5

be read one way or the other and then let's

6

attach that "otherwise" language to it.

7

seems pretty clear that the "otherwise"

8

language would be doing something.

9

MR. JAY:

And

And it

So -- well, of course, it is

10

doing something on both sides' reading, and I

11

think that, you know, that it creates this new

12

category -­

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

14

MR. JAY:

15

JUSTICE KAGAN:

16

MR. JAY:

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

-- but -- right.
You know what I mean.

I do.

And -- but in that -­

17

in both of his excellent briefs, right, you

18

won't find any dictionary definition anywhere

19

of "on sale," no -- no engagement with the

20

meaning of "on sale."

21

cross-reference to the government's brief.

22

There's just a -- just a

And the government cites a dictionary

23

that says that "on sale" means available for

24

purchase by customers.

25

someone who buys something.

And a customer is just
I -- it certainly

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
46
1

doesn't mean available in an open, you know,

2

non-hidden way, and it doesn't mean available

3

to the entire world.

4

One sale to one willing purchaser has

5

always been an invalidating sale.

And I think

6

that the reason for that -- one reason for

7

that, this Court brought out in Pfaff is that

8

it gives the inventor, him- or herself, a

9

degree of predictability.

The inventor

10

controls when -- when she wants to place her

11

invention on sale.

12

If, instead -- if it were something

13

more ambiguous that involved when the invention

14

is not just sold by the inventor to a

15

wholesaler or sold by the wholesaler to a

16

retailer but, instead, when it was placed on

17

sale by the retailer -­

process.

Given your position, you have the wrong answer

to the brownies hypothetical, I think, because

hypothetical.
MR. JAY:

Yeah, right.

I guess maybe

I'm -- maybe I'm misunderstanding the

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

You're saying it's

6

MR. JAY:

I'm saying that "on sale" is

7

not ambiguous.

8

when -- when chosen for continued inclusion in

9

the AIA.

10

It certainly was not ambiguous

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Even though it

11

says "otherwise available to the public," it's

12

still not ambiguous?

13

MR. JAY:

Even though it says

14

"otherwise available to the public," it's still

15

not ambiguous, that's right, because it -- it

16

would take more than that.

17

agree with Mr. Stewart when -- when he answered

18

this question.

19

And I agree -- I

It would take more than that to

20

unsettle the meaning of a term with such a

21

lengthy history and would be a very indirect

22

way, as I think Your Honor brought out in your

23

question in the top half of the argument, to

24

accomplish that.

25

So whatever the definition -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
49
1

dictionary definition, of "brownie" may be, and

2

I guess -- I confess I'm not up on that, I -- I

3

think that the -- the meaning of "on sale" is

4

sufficiently unambiguous.

5

And it certainly -- it certainly is

6

not the case that "otherwise" is some

7

talismanic word that is used in statutes, you

8

know, to unsettle the meaning of -- of words

9

that come before it.

I think the best examples

10

that we can give are "the party or other

11

activity that damages the house" in Barnhart.

12

"Party" -- "party," of course, is not even a

13

term of art.

14

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Well, they cite

15

the Paroline case as an example of a case where

16

a term -- a statute was structured like this,

17

and the term in the catch-all then was used to

18

influence the interpretation of the preceding

19

terms.

20

MR. JAY:

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

22
23

It was -­
Why is that

different?
MR. JAY:

It was used as -- the Court

24

said, it was used -- it summarized what the -­

25

you know, what the preceding terms did.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

It

Official - Subject to Final Review
50
1

certainly wasn't used to change or unsettle a

2

preexisting meaning.

3

for a couple of reasons.

4

I think it's different

One, the Court said in Paroline:

5

Number one, that it might well have reached the

6

same conclusion even if that language didn't

7

appear in the statute because of the strong

8

statute presumption that remedial statutes

9

contain a proximate cause element.

10

And, you

know, that is on page 446 of the opinion.

11

And, then on the next page, you'll see

12

that the -- the Court has a paragraph dealing

13

with the -- with the other language, and it

14

does two things:

15

modifier because it is equally applicable to

16

each of the five categories that's come before.

17

One, it treats it as a series

That was kind of like the argument

18

that the other side was making in the court of

19

appeals, that "otherwise available to the

20

public" is a -- is a series modifier that

21

actually modifies, as a matter of English

22

grammar, the terms that come before it in the

23

list.

24

that's why we're not talking anymore about the

25

rule of the last antecedent.

And they've abandoned that argument, and

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51
1

And then the third thing was -- was

2

the point about summarizing the categories that

3

come before.

4

that "available to the public" is a fair

5

summary of "on sale" either as a matter of

6

ordinary English or as a matter of the

7

specialized meaning that this Court has given

8

it.

9

In this case, we just don't think

And I think that Mr. Shanmugam, you

10

know, suggested that, you know -- you know,

11

Judge Hand kind of created this, the policy

12

behind the on-sale bar, as being something

13

about commercializing.

14

goes much further back that than that, and I

15

would urge the Court to look at a number of the

16

late 19th Century cases, such as Consolidated

17

Fruit-Jar, in which the Court said that the

18

inventor is not allowed to derive any benefit

19

from the sale or the use of his machine unless

20

he begins -- unless he applies for patenting

21

within the then grace period.

22

But I think the history

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Mr. Jay, say we

23

disagree with you, just for the purposes of

24

this hypothetical, and think that the

25

introduction of the "otherwise" clause

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
52
1

introduced some ambiguity about what "on sale"

2

means now.

3

I understand the Patent Office has an

4

interpretation of the statute.

5

do with that, if anything, or should we ignore

6

it?

7

MR. JAY:

What should we

I -- I think that it -- it

8

would only be relevant if it had the power to

9

persuade.

This Court has never given deference

10

to the Patent Office on substantive questions

11

of patentability, on what it takes to overcome

12

the bars put in the statute by Congress where

13

Congress has said you may not have a patent if

14

X, Y, or Z.

15

Now this Court has any number of

16

decisions in which it has held that a patent

17

issued by the Patent Office in conformance with

18

the -- with the office's then examination

19

guidelines were invalid.

20

So we think it's entitled to

21

respectful consideration, just as the

22

government's amicus brief in this case is

23

entitled to respectful consideration.

24

respectfully disagree with it.

25

that -- particularly because it doesn't deal

But we

We don't think

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
53
1

with the meaning of "on sale" and, in its

2

attempt to reconcile that with the new

3

language, it -- its suggestion of this new test

4

about availability to the public, meaning the

5

ultimate consumer, that's not based in

6

anything, text or definition or history or case

7

law of any kind.

8
9

But -- so we think that a virtue of
our position is that you don't need to get into

10

the question of what it means to be available

11

to the public when you're considering a sale.

12

You know, a sale or an offer for sale is a

13

concept that's been baked into this statute for

14

a long time.

15

Mr. Stewart urged the Court to look at

16

a number of aspects of this transaction, and

17

Mr. Shanmugam, in sort of the -- the end of his

18

four-part litany of why this -- why this

19

invention was not available to the public,

20

mentioned that -- that this was a development

21

agreement.

22

And I would urge the Court to look at

23

part 1 of the Federal Circuit's opinion, which

24

deals with the question whether this was a sale

25

at all.

That's a pretty specific inquiry into

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

whether the preconditions for this sale prevent

2

it from being a sale, as that term is used and

3

has been used for many, many years.

4

The other side, of course, didn't seek

5

certiorari on that question.

We don't think

6

it's properly before the Court.

7

seek certiorari on is -- and if you look

8

specifically at the question presented, it

9

doesn't use "available to the public"; it

What they did

10

refers specifically to secrecy, to -- to the

11

existence of a confidentiality agreement, you

12

know, a third-party that is obligated to keep

13

the invention confidential.

14

That's the only manifestation of not

15

available to the public that they put in the

16

question presented.

17

that, you know, the government's not defending

18

that view, and we think that adopting that view

19

under which stickering a -- an offer or a

20

product with a confidentiality agreement, and

21

thereby taking it off the table for purposes of

22

the on-sale bar, would be an incredibly

23

problematic view for -- for a variety of

24

reasons.

25

And I think you've heard

One, it would be easy to do.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

Two, it -- it would seriously

2

undermine the purpose of the -- the on-sale bar

3

because it would allow not just isolated

4

commercialization but really rampant

5

commercialization.

6

And then the third -- a third point

7

about what -- what it means to be available to

8

the public, about whether this -- this

9

distributor should count, and this goes back to

10

a question that -- that Justice Sotomayor asked

11

about, you know, if you asked a consumer, you

12

know, what -- what would it mean to be -- to be

13

on sale.

14

I think if you ask a pharmaceutical

15

company what does it mean for your product to

16

be on sale, what that pharmaceutical company

17

would say is we're selling it to a distributor,

18

because, as we've cited and as we explained in

19

our brief, 90 percent of the pharmaceuticals in

20

this country are sold not -- not directly from

21

the manufacturer to a consumer but to a

22

wholesaler or a -- or a distributor.

23

how they're sold.

That's

24

And so the implications of adopting

25

this ultimate consumer test would be to give

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

the pharmaceutical industry in particular and

2

any other industry that operates primarily

3

through wholesalers and distributors a real

4

free pass from the on-sale bar.

5

And that -- getting back to the basic

6

purpose of the bar, that would undermine the

7

statutory term, right?

8

said in Pfaff, confining the duration of the

9

monopoly to the statutory term is one of the

The -- as the Court

10

two key principles of the -- underlying the

11

on-sale bar.

12

We think that because Helsinn placed

13

its invention on sale and it was willing -- and

14

part 3 of the Federal Circuit's opinion -­

15

opinion explains why it was ready for

16

patenting, so it had one year in which to apply

17

for a patent.

18

It chose not to do that.

And then, many years later, after the

19

AIA was passed, it went back to the Patent

20

Office and it tried to get -- and it got a

21

patent that would be subject to the AIA that

22

was, as the Federal Circuit explained,

23

indistinguishable from -- for -- for relevant

24

purposes, materially indistinguishable, from

25

the pre-AIA patents it had -- it had obtained.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

And it said that the sale that had

2

invalidated -- that was going to invalidate its

3

prior pre-AIA patents doesn't invalidate this

4

post-AIA patent.

5

Helsinn to say that it's not withdrawing

6

anything from the stock of knowledge by getting

7

a patent.

8
9

So I think it's difficult for

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Mr. Jay, would the

prior secret sale of an invention by somebody

10

other than the patentholder invalidate the

11

patentholder's patent?

12

MR. JAY:

I think the answer is yes,

13

but I -- I've not seen cases like that because

14

I think it would be exceptionally difficult to

15

discover, whereas the way that the sale in this

16

case came to light and the way in which sales

17

in patent cases generally come to light is

18

through discovery from the inventor.

19

You know, as the Court said in Pfaff,

20

you want the inventor to have control about the

21

timing and the choice to commercialize the

22

invention.

23

And so a rule that gives the inventor

24

control over that necessarily has to leave out

25

the possibility that someone else might also

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

have the invention and start selling it, but

2

that's not been an implementation problem in -­

3

in reality.

4

If the Court has no further questions,

5

I'm prepared to yield back the balance of my

6

time.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF KANNON K.
SHANMUGAM ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

13
14
15

Thank you,

MR. SHANMUGAM:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
Our fundamental submission today is a

16

simple one.

17

should not be read in a vacuum but, rather, in

18

the context of the surrounding language.

19

It is that the phrase "on sale"

And the fundamental problem and the

20

dispositive problem, I would respectfully

21

submit, with Mr. Jay's submission is that it

22

really would read the word "otherwise" out of

23

the statute.

24
25

I think that the hypotheticals that
were proffered to Mr. Jay make that clear.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

let me, at the risk of introducing another one,

2

point to this Court's decision in one of my

3

favorite statutory interpretation cases, United

4

States versus Standard Brewery.

5

case that involved the Wartime Prohibition Act,

6

which prohibited the use of grains to

7

manufacture, in the language of the statute,

8

"beer, wine, and other intoxicating malt or

9

Venice liquor for beverage purposes."

10

That is the

And believe it or not, there was

11

actually a case in which a party was making

12

non-intoxicating beer, and the question was

13

whether the statute applied to that.

14

Court said no, applying the very principles

15

that we are articulating here.

16

And the

And the Court's rationale was that the

17

qualifying words "other intoxicating" in this

18

act cannot be rejected.

19

Justice Day, if the intention was to include

20

beer or wine, whether intoxicating or not, the

21

use of this phraseology was quite superfluous.

22

In the words of

And I would respectfully submit that

23

Mr. Jay really has no alternative way of

24

reading the very familiar term "otherwise."

25

Mr. Jay today, as in his excellent brief,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
60
1

suggests that "otherwise" could be read to

2

cover situations in which there's some overlap.

3

We know that the public use bar and

4

the on-sale bar have considerable overlap in

5

many cases.

6

nonsensical for Congress to have said "in

7

public use or otherwise on sale."

8

make sense as a matter of basic English.

9

But it would, of course, have been

That doesn't

And Respondents can point to none of

10

this Court's many cases involving catch-all

11

provisions that support that approach to the

12

statutory language.

13

JUSTICE BREYER:

You have a whole

14

brief, I mean, you know, you have a brief -- I

15

mean, everybody's is excellent.

Okay?

16

But the point is that -- that there is

17

a brief which gives the instance of an inventor

18

who talks daily through the Internet, or

19

otherwise, to 60,000 people and he tells those

20

60,000 people about his invention.

21

And that, they say, and similar or

22

other circumstances, are what this last phrase

23

is meant to cover.

24

MR. SHANMUGAM:

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

Just as -­
Now that gives a

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1
2

meaning to it.
MR. SHANMUGAM:

Yes.

Just as in

3

Standard Brewery, right?

4

provision was presumably included for a reason,

5

to include other malt or Venice beverages.

6

That's always true -­

7
8
9

JUSTICE BREYER:
they'll say.

That catch-all

Sometimes.

So what,

Sometimes yes, sometimes no.

MR. SHANMUGAM:

-- with a catch-all

10

provision.

11

catch-all provision in Seatrain Lines, the

12

catch-all provision in Paroline.

13

cases consistently make clear that these sorts

14

of catch-all provisions identify a key

15

characteristic that the preceding provisions

16

should be understood to share.

17

from the legislative history that that was the

18

better view of Congress's intent here.

19

That would have been true with the

And yet these

And we know

And while Respondents have this very

20

convoluted explanation of the evolution of the

21

statutory language, the one thing they can't

22

point to is any legislative history that

23

construes the final version of the AIA in the

24

way that they suggest.

25

Now I want to say just a word about

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

this contrary argument about "on sale" which

2

really relies on interpreting "on sale" in

3

vacuo.

4

I made the point in my opening

5

argument that there are no cases of this Court

6

that would come out differently under our

7

interpretation.

8

suggest differently.

9

I did not hear Respondents to

And, Justice Kagan, to the extent that

10

you asked a question along these lines about,

11

well, can we put together Pfaff and these

12

Federal Circuit cases and get enough to get to

13

some notion of ratification, our interpretation

14

retains Pfaff.

15

Pfaff, because I think that that was a case

16

where there was availability to the public.

17

It retains both the holding of

It was a somewhat unusual product

18

because it was a custom-made product.

19

think Texas Instruments really was the sum

20

total of the relevant public, but I think the

21

outcome would be the same.

22

And so I

And our whole point about why Congress

23

used this final formulation, to respond to

24

Justice Kavanaugh's questions on this point,

25

was to retain the existing jurisprudence

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
63
1

surrounding the bars.

2

And, in particular, with regard to

3

Pfaff, Pfaff, as the Court will be aware,

4

articulated the ready for patenting

5

requirement.

6

that very much would continue to have force.

7

The experimental use exception to which Mr.

8

Stewart referred would also continue to have

9

force.

10

That is a requirement in our view

And that explains, I think, even the

11

legislative history, the little bit of

12

legislative history to which Respondents point,

13

and in particular Representative Lofgren's

14

statement, because, by retaining those phrases,

15

while adding the catch-all provision, Congress

16

made clear that that jurisprudence should be

17

retained.

18
19

The judgment of the Federal Circuit
should be reversed.

20

Thank you.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:
The case is submitted.

Thank you,

21

counsel.

I am sure

22

we'll come up with an excellent opinion.

23

(Laughter.)

24

(Whereupon, at 11:59 a.m., the case

25

was submitted.)
