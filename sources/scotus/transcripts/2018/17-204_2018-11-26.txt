ORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIEL M. WALL

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

9
10

MR. WALL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:

11

The only damages theory in this

12

monopolization action is rooted in a 30 percent

13

commission that Apple charges app developers

14

and which allegedly causes those developers to

15

increase app prices to consumers.

16

The case is barred by the Court's

17

Illinois Brick doctrine because the developers'

18

pricing decisions are necessarily in the causal

19

chain that links the commission to any consumer

20

damages.

21

If the commission increases beyond the

22

competitive level, but apps developers do not

23

change their apps prices, consumers suffer no

24

damages.

25

prices to pass on some or all of the

And if app developers do change their

over-charge, well, that is precisely the kind

2

of damages theory that the Illinois Brick

3

doctrine prohibits.

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Is there any -- in

5

-- in your view, is there any first buyer in

6

this picture?

7

MR. WALL:

8

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

9

Excuse me?
Is there any first

buyer in this picture?

10

MR. WALL:

Well, there's -- there's

11

two different buyers in this picture.

12

are the app developers who, by contract with

13

Apple, are buying a package of services which

14

include distribution and software and

15

intellectual property and testing and -- and so

16

forth.

17

There

And then the plaintiffs in this case

18

are the -- the buyer of the apps themselves

19

that are made with that package of goods and

20

services and -­

21

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

My -- my question

22

was within Illinois Brick, is there in this

23

case anyone who would qualify as a first buyer

24

with standing to sue Apple?

25

MR. WALL:

The developers, yes.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

Without a doubt, the developers are the ones

2

who, in the first instance, pay the 30 percent

3

commission.

4

I think it's -- it is -- it is

5

important to root the analysis in the common

6

ground, which has been conceded, that the only

7

damages theory is based upon that 30 percent

8

commission.

9

between Apple and the developers.

That is charged by contract

15

It's the customer who pays the 30 percent.

MR. WALL:

But there has always been a

17

18

developer before that, which has the pricing

19

decision of what the developer is going to do

developer, who, by contract, agrees that every

time it puts a positive price on an app, it

it.

10

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Apple took

30 percent from the customer, not from the
developer.

11

MR. WALL:

Apple collects the -- the

12

funds, but even the Ninth Circuit here agreed

13

that -- that the process -- the payment flow is

14

immaterial to the Illinois Brick issue.

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

Certainly, I wouldn't

16

think that's true, even if they concluded it.

17

And in a simple theory, I would have thought it

18

would have been in antitrust for at least 100

years.

claim is the monopolist.

the monopolist?

What you do is you look to see who you

2

Now I can't find in reason or in case

3

law or in anything I've ever learned in

4

antitrust anything that would conflict with

5

that.

6

And what I want you is to tell me what?
MR. WALL:

What conflicts with that in

7

this case is that the alleged monopolization,

8

which is over the distribution function,

9

allegedly first manifests in a 30 percent

10

commission.

11

30 percent commission.

12

Consumers do not pay the

There was an effort in the -- in the

13

district court to try to argue that -- that

14

Apple added that, but that was abandoned.

15

what we have here instead is a damage theory

16

that runs through the independent pricing

17

decisions of the app developers.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So

Does your answer to

19

Justice Breyer depend on what you said, that

20

the alleged monopolization is in the

21

distribution function?

22

the -- the Respondents now to be saying, no,

23

that's wrong; the alleged monopolization is in

24

the apps themselves.

25

Because I understood

In other words, the consumer says you

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

have a monopoly on apps.

You might also have a

2

monopoly on the distribution function, which

the app developers have to live with, but you

4

have a monopoly on apps, which the consumers

5

have to live with.

6

MR. WALL:

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So, in responding to

Justice Breyer, you said:

the alleged monopoly is the distribution

function.

12
13

Well, it's because

But I don't think that that's

MR. WALL:

Well, two points, Justice

Kagan.

14

First of all, it is correct.

15

the complaint repeatedly alleges at paragraphs

monopolizes the apps as software.

What you do is

20

you buy from the farmers and you tell the

21

farmers what you will pay the banana farmers is

22

a very low price plus 30 percent commission.

23

And then what you do is, when you sell to

24

banana consumers throughout the world, you

25

charge them that 30 percent commission, which

they say is a higher price.

9

And I give the same advice to

MR. WALL:

And we thereby have -­

But the difference here is

10

-- is that there -- there is -- there is no

11

third-party intermediary that is setting the

12

price and exercising its independent

13

determination as to whether any or all of the

14

initial over-charge, which is some part or all

15

of the commission, is going to manifest itself

in the app's price.

3

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, Mr. Wall, I

4

think you're avoiding the question a bit

5

because, I mean, the questions that are being

6

put to you by my colleagues are really, what

7

was Illinois Brick about?

8

vertical supply chain or, instead, was it about

9

a pass-through theory?

10

Was it about a

Now, in the facts of Illinois Brick

11

and, indeed, in the facts of all the Illinois

12

Brick cases that we've discussed, you had both.

13

So you didn't have to separate the two.

14

And now, here, you don't have both,

15

because this is not a vertical supply chain,

16

but there still is a pass-through mechanism.

17

So then the question is, does Illinois Brick

18

apply to that or not?

19

And I think what Justice Breyer was

20

suggesting to you, that as long as it's not

21

that vertical supply chain where the person is

22

not buying from the monopolist itself, here,

23

the person is transacting with the monopolist

24

itself, that that's what separates this case

25

from Illinois Brick and makes it entirely

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

different, notwithstanding that there's some

2

kind of pass-through mechanism involved.

3

MR. WALL:

I completely agree with you

4

that the key to this is deciding what Illinois

5

Brick was about.

6

case about vertical chains, or was it about

7

pass-through?

8
9

Was it simply a formalistic

And in answering that question, I
would begin with, first of all, with Hanover

10

Shoe, which is about a pass-on defense and

11

about the -- the difficulties in -- in the -­

12

the -- the potential complication of antitrust

13

litigation through pass-on defense, and then

14

the framing of the question in Illinois Brick

15

by this Court which said, having already found

16

that we will not allow a pass-on defense, we

17

are now confronted with the question to whether

18

allow pass-on to be used offensively.

19

It was 100 percent about pass-on.

The

20

vertical chain was the factual setting of the

21

case, and, indeed, Respondents' argument would

22

-- would have this Court believe that the

23

factual setting is the sum and substance of the

24

Court's reasoning.

25

JUSTICE ALITO:

Mr. Wall, could I ask

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1

you about what troubles me about your position,

2

and -- and it is this:

Illinois Brick was not

3

about economic theory.

It was about the

4

court's -- the court's -- the basis for the

5

decision was not economic theory, as I read the

6

case.

7

makes for an effective and efficient litigation

8

scheme.

9

It's the court's calculation of what

And maybe your answer to this question

10

is that the validity of Illinois Brick is not

11

before us.

12

light of what has happened since then, the

13

court's evaluation stands up.

14

But I really wonder whether, in

Take the third point that it makes

15

about that the direct -- the so-called direct

16

purchasers are the most efficient and most -­

17

in the best position to -- to sue.

18

If we look at this case, how many app

19

developers are there whose apps are sold at the

20

Apple store?

21

MR. WALL:

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

23
24
25

Tens of thousands.
Yeah.

Has any one of

them ever sued?
MR. WALL:

None have ever sued.

have been -- there have been plenty of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

There

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

disputes, but none has ever gone to litigation.

2

For that matter, no state or federal antitrust

3

agency has ever sued either.

4

We do not take that -- we do not take

5

the -- the absence of litigation as evidence of

6

an oppressed developer community that cannot

7

speak for itself.

8

of the matter is that nowadays major companies

9

suing their suppliers happens all of the time.

10

These -- you know, the fact

The idea that it -- that it -- that it

11

doesn't, which was decried by Judge Posner as

12

fanciful, has proven to be fanciful because it

13

literally happens all of the time.

14

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, Mr. Wall,

15

along those lines, I -- I take your point that

16

Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe might be read

17

about the economic realities of the

18

pass-through mechanism being important, rather

19

than the contractual formalities, whether it's

20

a sales agent or a formal purchase between the

21

manufacturer and the distributor.

22
23

And antitrust normally accounts for
economics, rather than forms of contract.

24

MR. WALL:

Indeed.

25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I take your point.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

But building on what Justice Alito had

2

in mind, Illinois Brick has been questioned by

3

31 states before this Court in an amicus brief.

4

You're asking us to extend Illinois Brick,

5

admittedly, only because of a contractual

6

formality and the economic realities are the

7

same.

8

of this question.

9

I'll spot you all of that for purposes

But why should we build on Illinois

10

Brick?

11

perhaps, given the fact that so many states

12

have done so.

13

Shouldn't we question Illinois Brick,

They've repealed it.

There haven't been a huge number of

14

reported problems with indirect purchasers and

15

direct purchasers receiving double recovery,

16

one of the problems Illinois Brick built on,

17

and the other one, which Justice Alito alluded

18

to, is direct purchasers don't always sue

19

because there's a threat that monopolists will

20

share the rents with the direct purchasers.

21

MR. WALL:

Right.

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

And indirect

23

purchasers may be better suited to enforce the

24

antitrust laws.

25

So long wind-up.

what to do with the Illinois Brick doctrine.

19

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Why?

Why is that

20

so if the Court created the doctrine in the

21

first place?

22

MR. WALL:

Because I don't think it's

23

fair to say that the Court just created it.

24

What the Court did was it applied the

25

foundational principle of all Section 4

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
19
1

jurisprudence, which is the proximate cause

2

principle of damages not going past the first

3

step, and then it -- it dealt with that in the

4

context of the potential for duplicative

5

pass-through over-charge claims, which are a

6

unique problem in antitrust.

7

It's not a general problem of all

8

damage theories.

But, when you have

9

over-charge cases -- and this gets to Justice

10

Gorsuch's point about the potential for -- for

11

duplicative recovery -- it's not hypothetical.

12

It's automatic.

13

It's mathematical.

If the first purchaser gets

14

100 percent of the over-charge because of

15

Hanover Shoe, anything else that is recovered

16

that gets added on to that is necessarily

17

duplicative, and that's what happens in the

18

district courts.

19

and the direct purchasers suing on whatever

20

theory optimizes their level of recovery.

You get the direct purchasers

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

How do we know

4

that?

How do we know that, given that Apple

5

really operates as a retailer in many respects

6

here, as Justice Kagan points out?

7

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

8

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

And how do we know

9
10

that the 30 percent charge is not affecting the
price?

11
12
13

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Well, you don't

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

In the same way

know -­

14

that any retailer that adds 30 percent would

15

affect the ultimate price paid by the consumer?

16

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

You don't know for

17

sure, but that's the whole point.

Here,

18

because app makers set the final price, they

19

have a choice to make:

20

over-charge and keep prices the same, in which

21

case the consumers aren't harmed at all, or

22

they increase their prices to recoup the

23

over-charge, in which case the app makers are

24

also harmed because they face a drop in sales

25

as a result of increased prices.

They either absorb the

But the consumers

are harmed then too.
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes, Your Honor.

And that's the whole point of Illinois Brick

7

the full brunt of the over-charge in the first

8

instance because of its pricing decision,

9

that's the party that gets the whole claim.

When you've got part of the

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But we have

11

ambiguity about what Illinois Brick means here,

12

and shouldn't that ambiguity, if -- if there is

such ambiguity, be resolved by looking at the

14

text of the statute?

Any person injured?

15

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes, Your Honor.

16

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

That's broad.

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And what I think

18

that Illinois Brick reflects is the type of

19

statutory interpretation that this Court has

20

engaged in in a variety of cases, including the

21

RICO cases, including the Lexmark cases, where

22

you interpret background principles of

23

proximate cause to be built into the statute,

24

including the rule that damages stop at the

25

first step.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Does it make a

2

difference, General, that -- that Apple is

3

influencing the prices here?

4

this is -- you're suggesting that the app

5

developers are just sort of setting these

6

prices independently -­

7

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Uh-huh.

-- but I'll give you

sort of two ways in which that's not true.

10
11

In other words,

The first way is this 99 cent
charge -­

12

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Uh-huh.

-- which you might

14

say, well, that doesn't matter because, you

15

know, it could be 99 cents or it could be

16

$100.99.

17

But, in fact, these are all low-cost

18

products for the most part.

19

has to end with the -- you know, the -- the

20

number 99 is saying a lot about the fact that

21

you can't charge 77 cents or 55 cents -­

22

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

23

JUSTICE KAGAN:

24
25

So saying a price

Sure.

-- or 32 cents.

So

that's one.
And the other is the entire allegation

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

here is that Apple is truly a monopolist on

2

both sides of the market.

3

to developers whatever price structure it

4

wants, and it's also able to dictate to

5

consumers what the nature of the sale is going

6

to be.

It's able to dictate

7

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

8

JUSTICE KAGAN:

9

Right.

And in that event, it

-- it sure seems as though, you know, Apple -­

10

you know, it happened to set up this commission

11

that puts it in the ambit of Illinois Brick,

12

but it could have done a thousand other things

13

that are essentially the same that would have

14

taken it out of the Illinois Brick rule.

15

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

16

take those points in turn.

17

pricing policy.

Sure.

And let me

First, the 99 cent

18

The first thing I'll point out is it's

19

not in the complaint, but we'll put that to the

20

side and assume that it's part of this case.

21

Here, I don't think it changes the fact that

22

the app makers still control the overall price,

23

and to the extent that -- to the extent that

24

Respondents are harmed by that, it's based on a

25

pass-through.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

Look, if I go to an auction house and

2

I have to bid in $10 increments, nobody thinks

3

the auction house is setting the price.

4

bidders are still setting the price.

5

here, the Respondents are -­

6

JUSTICE KAGAN:

7

in $10 increments and the -- and the true

8

alternative prices are $3, $5, and $7 -­

9
10

12

GENERAL FRANCISCO:
JUSTICE KAGAN:

The

Right.

-- then, indeed, you

are setting the price.
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

And, well, that's

13

my second point, Your Honor.

14

is based on a pass-through because app makers

15

are either going to round up or they're going

16

to round down.

18

injured at all.

by that.

2

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I -­

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

As I understand,

4

they're saying it's not the 30 percent; it is

5

what the price would be if we could buy apps

6

outside of this closed loop.

7

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I -­

8

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

And it could be

9

theoretically a lot higher than the markup, it

10

could well be within it, but the point is that

11

that 30 percent -- that 30 percent or whatever

12

that 30 -­

13

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Uh-huh.

14

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- percent figure

15

is, is not the measure of our damages.

16

as I understand -­

That's

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yeah -­

18

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

-- that they're

19

saying the developers may have their own claim,

20

their damages likely have to stay within the

21

30 percent, but we don't measure our damages by

22

that.

23

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

So, respectfully,

24

I'll disagree with that, and in explaining it,

25

Justice Kagan, I think I can also answer the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1
2

second part of your question.
The harm to the consumers here is that

3

they have to pay higher prices for apps, and

4

the reason they have to pay higher prices for

5

apps -- and, Justice Kagan, this goes to your

6

question -- is because Apple controls the

7

pipeline that connects app makers on the one

8

hand and iPhone users on the other.

9

And the way they exploit that pipeline

10

through their alleged monopoly is by charging

11

that 30 percent commission.

12

consumers are harmed here in the form of paying

13

higher prices is because the app makers decide

14

to increase their prices in order to recoup

15

that commission.

16

So the only reason

And, Justice Breyer, to your question,

17

the reason why this makes it different than

18

your hypothetical of Bill buys from Sam and you

19

have transactional proximity is because the

20

question isn't proximity between the parties

21

who are transacting with one another but

22

proximity between the antitrust violation, the

23

30 percent commission, and the harm to

24

consumers in the form of higher prices.

25

JUSTICE BREYER:

I wouldn't have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

thought that was the antitrust violation.

2

would have thought the antitrust violation is

3

having enormous market power achieved by not

4

patents and not skill, foresight, and industry

5

but, rather, anticompetitive or more

6

restrictive than necessary practices.

7

Alcoa -­

8

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

I

For sure.

-- Alcoa did not

10

charge higher than competitive prices, and

11

that's why Learned Hand said the easy life, not

12

necessarily higher prices, is the reward,

13

often, of monopoly.

Now -­

14

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

15

JUSTICE BREYER:

For sure -­

-- I would have

16

thought it's a matter for proof at the damages

17

stage whether, in fact, Apple, assuming they

18

prove it is a monopoly, has extracted higher

19

than competitive prices from those particular

20

people, the plaintiffs, or whether they've just

21

had the easy life.

22

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

23

JUSTICE BREYER:

Right.

Now I don't think

24

that's the stage we're at in this case.

25

you say right, right, right -­

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So, if

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

JUSTICE BREYER:

Well -­

-- then they must

win.

4

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

-- no -- so what I

5

wanted to say is that, for sure, the Illinois

6

Brick theory doesn't apply across the board,

7

but it does apply when somebody is bringing an

8

over-charge theory, as in Illinois Brick, as in

9

Hanover Shoe, and as here.

10
11

JUSTICE BREYER:

The -­
Have we had trial on

that?

12

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, where

13

you have that kind of over-charge theory, what

14

Illinois Brick says -- asks is, under basic

15

principles of proximate cause, is there some

16

party other than the monopolist that's standing

17

in between the plaintiffs' injury in the form

18

of higher prices and the monopolist's violation

19

in the form of the commission.

20

And whenever the price setter, the

21

ultimate price setter, is somebody other than

22

the monopolist, it's never the monopolist's

23

over-charge that is the direct cause of the

24

injury.

25

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But -- but if the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
31
1

app developer -- if Apple bought the apps from

2

the app developer and then added 30 percent to

3

it and sold it to the consumer, you would agree

4

that a claim could lie there, correct?

5

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Your Honor, I want

6

to make sure I understand the hypothetical.

7

Apple said -­

8
9

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

If

Apple's buying the

app from the app developer for a price -­

10

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Right.

11

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- Apple's then

12

adding 30 percent to that price and selling it

13

to the consumer.

14

Apple's doing that as a result of monopolistic

15

behavior.

The consumer alleges that

16

The claim lie?

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes, you can sue

18

Apple directly, but you can't sue Apple if the

19

-- if -- if Apple isn't the price-setting

20

party, but the app maker is the price-setting

21

party.

22

answer, Your Honor?

23

And that's why -- may I finish the

And that's why the key is who sets the

24

price, and it's very hard to manipulate our

25

rule because, under our rule, you actually have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32

to change the party that has the authority to

set the final price, and that's a fundamental

3

change in the nature of the transaction itself.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Thank you,

counsel.
Mr. Frederick.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID C. FREDERICK
ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FREDERICK:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice, and may it please the Court:
Apple directed anticompetitive

12

restraints at iPhone owners to prevent them

13

from buying apps anywhere other than Apple's

14

monopoly App Store.

15

paid Apple more for apps than they would have

16

paid in a competitive retail market.

17

As a result, iPhone owners

Under this Court's precedents, iPhone

18

owners have a cause of action under Section 4

19

of the Clayton Act directly against Apple for

20

those over-charges.

21

should be affirmed for three reasons.

22
23
24
25

The court of appeals

First, Illinois Brick is a bright-line
rule that Respondents easily satisfy.
Second, Apple directed its monopoly
abuses at Respondents.

So it's appropriate

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1

that Respondents can sue Apple for their

2

damages as a result of those violations.

3

And, third, Apple seeks to expand and

4

modify the bright-line rule of Illinois Brick

5

to deny indisputably direct purchasers an

6

antitrust remedy and to change the rule into a

7

standardless inquiry that will be hard to apply

8

at the pleadings stage.

9

Now, if I could return to the first

10

point, the direct purchaser rule is a

11

bright-line rule.

12

Illinois Brick and, importantly, a case that

13

has not yet been discussed today, in UtiliCorp,

14

in which the Court said Illinois Brick is a

15

bright-line rule for direct purchasers,

16

notwithstanding the economics that go into

17

that.

18

This Court said so in

UtiliCorp was a case that protected

19

the defendants, who were asserting that -- who

20

-- who were asserting that the -- there was a

21

break in the link of the chain.

22

This case is really the flip side of

23

that to protect plaintiffs who directly

24

purchased from the alleged antitrust violator

25

and are claiming damages as a result of that

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1
2

antitrust violation.
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

There's -­

3

there's one antitrust violation under your

4

theory, which is the increase, the 30 percent

5

increase that Apple imposes when it -- when

6

it's -- when, as you put it, it sells the apps?

7

MR. FREDERICK:

Wrong.

And this is

8

very important for the Court to understand.

9

The antitrust violation here is the monopoly

10

App Store.

11

anywhere other than Apple's 100 percent-owned

12

monopoly App Store.

13

Consumers cannot buy an app

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

But, when it

14

comes to the -- the 30 percent increase, you're

15

-- you're obviously saying the purchasers,

16

again, under your theory of the apps, are

17

harmed by that and recover -- can recover

18

damages for that, and also that the developers

19

are harmed by that and they can recover damages

20

for it as well.

21

In other words, to the extent it might

22

be said that Apple is a two-sided market,

23

they're -- they're subject to suit on both

24

sides of the market for a single antitrust

25

price increase that they're alleged to have

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
35
1

imposed.

2

MR. FREDERICK:

So, Mr. Chief Justice,

3

I think that your question kind of gets to the

4

core of a lot of the confusion here because, by

5

having a wholly-owned monopoly App Store, Apple

6

is able to distort the market at the supply

7

chain and at the retail chain for consumers.

8
9

We, representing consumer iPhone
owners, are suing only for the damages that we

10

incur.

11

competitive market price would be for apps.

12

That is the higher than what a

Our measure of damages is not

13

necessarily the 30 percent.

14

15

monopolist because it extracts -­

16

The 30 percent is

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

No, no, I

17

18

side of the market.

19

20
21

But you do think that the

4

No -­
-- for the

same -­

5

MR. FREDERICK:

-- I disagree with

6

that, Mr. Chief Justice.

7

the apps, if they have a claim, it is that

8

Apple has distorted the market for the supply

9

of apps in a way that hurts app developers'

10

Apple's supplier of

profits.

11

Their argument would be, if we weren't

12

suffering under the one monopoly store

13

constraint, we might be able to charge a

14

different price lower than 99 cents and be able

15

to get a direct purchase from an iPhone Apple

16

owner.

17

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, I think

18

you're just saying that the measure of damages

19

would be different between the two sides of the

20

market?

21
22
23

MR. FREDERICK:

And -- but they would

be different damages.
JUSTICE KAGAN:

In other words, you

24

are saying the consumer says, I'm paying a

25

higher price for the product.

It might be the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

entire 30 percent commission, it might be some

2

portion of the 30 percent commission, that's

3

super-competitive, but I'm paying a higher

4

price for the product.

5

And the app developer says:

Well, I

6

don't -- you know, that's irrelevant to me.

7

don't have to buy the product.

8

to me is fewer people are buying my apps.

9

I

What's relevant

And that represents some amount of

10

lost profits.

11

I mean, it is true that two people are being

12

able to sue because Apple is -- is transacting

13

with each of these people and each of them has

14

a gripe against what -- the way Apple has

15

structured the market.

16

But those two things are not -­

But the damages are entirely

17

different.

One is a measure of lost profits,

7
8

JUSTICE ALITO:

But if you read

So the 30 percent has

nothing to do with this?

9

MR. FREDERICK:

The -- what the

10

30 percent is, is an allegation that Apple is

11

monopolizing the sale of apps.

12

that because they can extract 30 percent on

13

every single sale, which only a monopolist

14

could do.

15

And we know

The 30 percent is not a measure of

16

damages.

17

Court that says you have to plead antitrust

18

damages with particularity.

19

of the ability to extract a monopoly rent, we

20

can say in good faith that they -- we are

21

paying more than we would pay than if a

22

competitive market existed.

23

I'm not aware of any case from this

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But the -- because

Mr. Frederick, I

24

think you'd agree that there can only be one

25

monopoly rent.

And then the question becomes,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

who's paying it?

2

And it might be spread partially

3

between direct purchasers and indirect

4

purchasers.

5

between the app makers and the purchasers of

6

apps.

7

that we've been wrestling with here.

8
9

It might be partially spread

And disaggregating that is the question

I guess here is where I'm stuck and
need your help.

You say that Illinois Brick is

10

a bright-line rule premised on the existence of

11

a contractual relationship between the buyer -­

12

the ultimate purchaser and the intermediate

13

seller, and that there has to be that kind of

14

relationship, rather than a sales agency

15

relationship like we have here.

16

But antitrust doesn't usually depend

17

upon such contractual formalities.

18

depends upon the underlying economics.

19

have a hard time distinguishing this case from

20

Illinois Brick in the sense of -- in the

21

question of economic pass-through and the

22

problems that it presents, the possibility that

23

the intermediate purchaser may absorb the

24

monopoly rent and not pass it along.

25

It usually
And I

Now that raises for me the question,

further question, and I -- I -- I'll wind it up

quickly, I promise, whether Illinois Brick is

a whole -- a whole bunch of things for you to

MR. FREDERICK:

Okay.

I'll try to

chew on them succinctly, Your Honor.

We haven't asked for Illinois Brick to

be overruled because we plainly meet the

bright-line rule.

We paid Apple and Apple was

That's the

If I could try

19

to answer your question with a hypothetical,

20

and if the Court would indulge me, suppose in a

21

competitive market the price for an app was 90

22

cents, not 99 cents, as Apple is charging.

23

It's 90 cents.

We would all agree, I

think, that the consumer can sue for the nine

MR. FREDERICK:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

5

I understand the 99

Okay.
Let's put that

aside.

6

MR. FREDERICK:

All right.

Now that

7

we've got that aside, let's look at it from the

8

developer's perspective.

9

If they had a claim -- if they had a

10

claim -- and I'm not saying that they do -- but

11

if they had a claim, they would need to show

12

the difference between the profits that they

13

would have achieved in the monopoly App Store

14

versus the profits they would have achieved at

15

a competitive market price.

16

And that depends on three factors,

17

okay?

18

would achieve between 99 cents and 99 -- 90

19

cents.

20

differences would affect their revenue.

21

the third is whether the commission was

22

30 percent in a competitive market.

23

One is the difference in sales that they

The second is how their sales
And

Okay?

So, if you take my hypothetical, the

24

damages for the developer, there are three

25

possibilities.

One is that it's zero.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

If the

Official - Subject to Final Review
43
1

commission went to 22 percent in a competitive

2

market, the developer takes home 70 cents just

3

as it does with Apple's 30 percent in a 99 cent

4

monopoly market.

5

developer has zero damages.

6

At 22 percent commission, the

The developer would have positive

7

damages if the commission were zero because

8

then the app developer sustains damages of 20

9

cents.

The developer would make the 90 cents

10

in the competitive market instead of the 70

11

cents that Apple is now passing along by virtue

12

of the monopoly market.

13

The damages would be negative, though,

14

if, in a competitive market, the commission

15

stayed at 30 percent because, there, the

16

benefits that would achieve by the monopoly

17

price of 99 cents give the developer an extra

18

eight cents per transaction.

19

So, in that way, Mr. Chief Justice,

20

the developer has a different claim that's

21

based on its lost profits.

22

irrespective of whether the buyer of the app,

23

the consumer, sustains damage for the nine

24

cents in my hypothetical.

25

And that would be

In your case -- and -- and Justice

MR. FREDERICK:

21

JUSTICE BREYER:

That's correct.
And you're adding one

22

thing.

One of the things that we want to use

23

in order to prove that they do have monopoly

24

power, i.e., the power to raise price

25

significantly above a competitive level, is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

they charge us so bloody much money.

That's

2

just a piece of evidence here, and we'll worry

3

later, agreeing that there's only one monopoly

profit in theory, as to who got what.

5

Now have I stated that correctly?

6

MR. FREDERICK:

7

Breyer.

9

Yes, you have, Justice

I mean, the basic problem in this case
as it comes to this Court is who gets to

10

complain about the monopoly App Store.

11

as the buyers of the apps from the monopoly App

create a different form versus function

was a competitive market.

We're paying the money.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

They say it would

20

be different if Apple purchased the apps from

21

the app developer and then added 30 percent on

22

the sale.

23

And why is that not different?

24

MR. FREDERICK:

Because it's

And here's where we part company

7

It's irrelevant

That's what the violation is.

That's

So, in the very hypothetical, Justice

8

Kavanaugh, that you posed to the Solicitor

General, the Solicitor General concedes we are

10

direct purchasers in a situation where the app

developer sets the price and they simply tack

12

on 30 percent by virtue of their monopoly

13

power.

14

It's no different here.

If you think

15

about it in -- in terms of what is actually

16

going on, suppose Apple dropped its commission

17

from 30 percent to 20 percent, but it

18

maintained the price restriction of a 99 cent

app.

MR. FREDERICK:

So we would still be

direct purchasers if, under your hypothetical,

17

we're buying it from Apple and then Apple is

18

engaging in the Justice Gorsuch form over

19

function situations in terms of how the money

20

gets moved around.

21

I think that the -- in that situation,

22

we are still directly purchasing and we're

23

still able to complain about Apple's violation.

24

And I think, under your hypothetical, Justice

25

Sotomayor, we have to keep the idea that Apple

Heritage Reporting Corporation

2

is still operating a monopoly App Store.
It's no different than if there was a

3

grocery store chain that monopolized the sale

say that that monopoly store outlet was able to

control prices and affect output.

Justice Sotomayor's question is a -- requires

What the Court decides doctrinally to

12

where I think you go to a different situation

if the case arises.

We

But, on your other point, I think it's

15

the other side that is actually asking for the

16

opportunity to use contracts in order to

17

distort or recharacterize matters in a way that

18

evades the Illinois Brick bright-line rule.

19

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well -- well, assume

20

for the moment that -- that I believe the

21

economics underlying the two arrangements are

22

very similar.

23

yet heard you give me a good argument why.

24
25

Hard to distinguish.

So let's just posit that.

I haven't

Then it

really is just about form, isn't it?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

1

MR. FREDERICK:

No, I think in that

2

hypothetical, I would be prepared to say if we

3

were paying the developer directly for the app

4

and the app developer could set whatever price

5

it wanted to set, okay, keep with me on that

6

assumption, the app developer operating in a

7

free market can set whatever it wants to set,

8

and then Apple comes after the app developer

9

and says, hey, you bought it -- the consumer

10

bought it through our store, we want whatever

11

we want, that becomes not a problem with the

12

consumer; that becomes a problem between the

13

developer and the app -- and the seller of the

14

app.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Ah, so pricing

control is really important to proximate cause

MR. FREDERICK:

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I beg your pardon?

is really important to proximate cause?
MR. FREDERICK:

No, pricing control is

22

not important to pricing -- to proximate cause

direct proximate cause, we're buying the app

25

directly from the app developer, and, remember,

is putting form over the reality?

13

Your point was that the other side

MR. FREDERICK:

That's correct.

And

14

-- and they're doing it in a way that is

15

particularly standardless, because what the

16

court in UtiliCorp held was that even when it

17

is absolutely clear 100 percent of the

18

over-charge is going from the natural gas

19

supplier through the utility directly to the

20

consumer, this Court held:

No, we're going to

21

keep the bright-line rule.

Only the utility

22

gets to complain about the natural gas

over-charge.

24
25

And it was that bright-line rule that
the Court said is going to apply.

And the

reason is exactly, Justice Alito, for the point

that you made, which is that it's about

Here, that's clearly the

And so, to -- to Justice Kavanaugh, to

10

finish off the point, what the other side is

11

essentially asking is that, instead of having a

because they don't have a test for what

your argument is that it doesn't seem to be

Now I accept, Justice Alito, that

14

there have been a lot of arguments and this

15

idea about the 30 percent has led to a certain

16

lack of clarity, but I think that the position

17

we have written in our brief is the best

articulation of what the underlying theory is

19

here, and that is that the Apple monopoly App

20

Store over-charges iPhone owners for apps.

22

rule of the end in 99-cent requirement in that

theory is what?

25

existed, or would it not?

In other words, would your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
55
1

MR. FREDERICK:

It would be still an

2

over-charge case, Justice Kagan, because the

3

theory economically is that, if you are having

4

to buy only from a monopoly, you are paying

5

more than you would if there was a, you know,

6

discount apps warehouse or you could buy

7

directly from the app's developer.

8

Our assertion is that, with multiple

9

sellers, multiple suppliers of the apps, we

10

would be able to buy them at a lower price.

11

It's that competition.

12
13

JUSTICE KAGAN:

So what's the

significance of that end in 99-cent rule?

14

MR. FREDERICK:

The significance of it

15

is that it informs the price elevation and the

16

price over-charge.

17

contrary to Apple's assertion, they are not the

18

agent of the apps developers.

19

that in their contract.

20

you get to Justice Gorsuch's form over

21

substance problem, because, at 99 cents,

they're telling the app developer, we're

9

direct purchasers of those apps.

10

JUSTICE ALITO:

If this case were to

11

go to trial as a class action, would every app

12

purchaser potentially be entitled to three

13

times the 30 percent over-charge, or would it

14

depend on the particular app?

MR. FREDERICK:

Your Honor, I -- I

16

think that -- I don't know the answer to your

17

question fully.

18

thought about how the experts are actually

19

going to try to prove it up.

20

I'll be candid.

I have not

What I would say, though, is that

21

they're probably -- what will likely happen is

22

that because there are apps that are sold at 99

23

cent, a huge number of them are free, but a

24

huge number are sold at 99 cents, some other

25

strata is sold for $1.99, some other strata is

Heritage Reporting Corporation

1

sold for $2.99 or $6.99, and I haven't put my

2

head around, to be perfectly honest, exactly

3

how you would carve up the damages on some sort

4

of a pro rata basis.

5

of the Clayton Act is that treble damages is

6

designed to deter antitrust violations.

7

But the idea, of course,

And so this Court has made very clear

8

in its cases that the point of having that

9

deterrence is to avoid having the monopolist in

10

this case act in a way that it's not penalized

11

for its monopoly behavior.

12

And if you were to suppose that it was

13

just a single damages problem, it would be easy

14

for monopolists to simply act, and, if they get

15

caught, they just simply pay over what they

16

caused in damage, but the idea behind the

17

Clayton Act's treble damages remedy is designed

18

to deter actions just like this.

19

And that is why Apple cannot point to

20

another e-commerce distributor that does what

21

it does.

22

out in the red brief, there is an alternative

23

to buying the product.

24
25

In every other instance, as we point

And, in fact, Apple doesn't even do
this with its own computer software.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And we

have pleaded that in the complaint, Mr. Chief

2

Justice, where we say that, if you buy

3

software, you can buy it open source and you do

4

not have to buy it through Apple's monopoly

5

chain.

6

So the iPhone app monopoly App Store

7

is a unique feature of the e-commerce setting.

8

Apple has found ways using technology and

9

contractual constraints to limit the

10

opportunity of a competitive market to

11

flourish.

12

If a competitive market did flourish,

13

the prices that iPhone owners pay would be

14

lower.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

22

MR. WALL:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.
I think I need to begin with the

23

experience I had in this case for its first

24

nine years, and that is it was about a

25

30 percent commission.

Paragraph 48 of the complaint is -- is

2

-- is the key allegation, which is the root of

3

the damages theory, which maintains that the

4

30 percent commission is a monopoly price.

5

It's called a monopoly price.

6

It's elsewhere called a

7

super-competitive price.

damages theory not just in part, not just on

9

the periphery, but entirely.

10

It is the root of the

The brief in opposition at -- at pages

11

5 and 12 make this unmistakably clear.

12

at page 5, the brief in opposition states:

13

"Respondents seek damages based solely on the

14

30 percent markup."

15

At -­

So whatever other attributes of this

16

case one may want to talk about that might

17

contribute to the liability theory, the injury

18

theory, the damages theory, is, in their words,

19

solely about the -- the 30 percent.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Wall, I have a

21

question about this Court's case law, and I'd

22

-- I'd like your answer to it.

23

If Apple had in every agreement with

24

an iPhone owner a provision that you can sue -­

25

you can't sue, you have to go to an arbitrable

forum in a one-by-one, then Apple would be home

2

free in this case?

3

MR. WALL:

We -- we do not have such a

4

provision.

5

agreements with both developers and consumers

6

state that -- that there shall be litigation in

7

the Northern District of California.

In fact, the -- all of the relevant

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Yeah, I -- I know

-- I know you don't, but suppose you did.
MR. WALL:

If -- if that were the

11

case, then this would be a matter for

12

arbitration, and I don't think it changes the

13

legal question.

14

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

And -- and it would

15

take this case out of this Court, put it in an

16

arbitrable forum, with a single complainant?
