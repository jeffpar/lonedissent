CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

We'll hear

5

versus Warren.

6

Mr. Cooper.

7

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

9
10

MR. COOPER:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:

11

In the PG&E case, this Court held

12

that, although the State of California had the

13

undisputed regulatory power to place a

14

moratorium on the construction of new nuclear

15

plants, it was preempted under the Atomic

16

Energy Act from using that undisputed de jure

17

authority as a means for indirectly and de

18

facto regulating the nuclear safety of nuclear

19

plants.

20

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Mr. Cooper, there's

21

something odd with using PG&E for your side,

22

because the bottom line in that case was no

23

preemption.

24

MR. COOPER:

That's true, Your Honor.

25

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

So to say, well,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
4
1

they had -- they said all this stuff along the

2

way, but the bottom line judgment in -- and

3

that was true in English as well -- no

4

preemption?

5

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, and -- and

6

the reason that the Court in PG&A came -- PG&E

7

came to that conclusion was it accepted the

8

court of appeals' interpretation of state law

9

that the purpose -- the purpose of that

10

regulatory -- that -- that -- the court's or

11

the -- California's exercise of regulatory

12

authority was not for the purpose of protecting

13

against radiation hazards, which is the -­

14

which is the line drawn in the statute between

15

what is federal and what is state.

16

So PG&E, Your Honor, as I say, in -­

17

clearly held that the state could not

18

indirectly -- use its acknowledged authority to

19

indirectly and de facto regulate a activity

20

that was in the exclusive authority of the NRC.

21
22

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:
it's -­

23

MR. COOPER:

24

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

25

What -- what if

And in this case -­
What if it's dual

purpose?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

MR. COOPER:

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

3

MR. COOPER:

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So how -- how does

that work?

8
9

That's true, Your Honor,

and -­

6
7

Which a lot of

things are going to be in this context.

4
5

Well, Your Honor -­

MR. COOPER:

Justice Kavanaugh, in a

case where it's a dual purpose, this Court in

10

PG&E said, is it grounded in the impermissible

11

purpose?

12

appeals have had no problem examining

13

situations where -- and that's going to be true

14

in most -­

Is it grounded in -- the courts of

15
16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but, Mr.

Cooper -­

17

MR. COOPER:

-- legislation.

18

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

-- Mr. Cooper, then

19

-- then we -- don't we get into trouble under

20

Shady Grove of guessing what the motivations of

21

a state legislature are and all the

22

methodological, epistemological, and federalism

23

questions that that raises?

24

about that?

25

MR. COOPER:

What do we do

Your Honor, this Court in

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
6
1

a variety of contexts is called upon to examine

2

the legislative purpose of a particular

3

enactment -­

4

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I know we do it in

5

the Fourteenth -- Fourteenth Amendment context,

6

for example, but I'm -­

7

MR. COOPER:

8

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

9

Yes.
-- I'm hard pressed

to come up with many other examples where we -­

10

where we look at a state legislative purpose

11

and -- and -- and decide its permissibility

12

based on our assessment of -- of legislative

13

motive.

14

MR. COOPER:

Well, Your Honor, and we

15

have not been able to find another statute

16

where Congress has prescribed a purpose-based

17

preemption standard.

18

But Congress has nonetheless, in terms

19

that are quite clear and in terms that this

20

Court in PG&E accepted and implemented, made

21

purpose the line between what is state -- what

22

is state and what is federal with respect to

23

the regulation of nuclear power development.

24
25

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

So we're just stuck

with purpose whether we like it or not.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

I -- I

Official - Subject to Final Review
7
1

-- I got it.

2

MR. COOPER:

3

bottom line, yes, Your Honor.

4

That's -- that's the

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But is PG&E perhaps

5

distinguishable on this basis:

6

there California was directly regulating the

7

construction of nuclear power plants,

8

prohibiting them, and that is an area under,

9

what is it, 2021(c) that's expressly preempted.

10

That at least

Here, you have efforts to regulate

11

mining, an upstream activity, that are not

12

expressly dealt with in the statute.

13

do we do about that?

14

MR. COOPER:

So what

Your Honor, I don't think

15

that distinguishes PG&E at all because, in

16

PG&E, the state was using its acknowledged

17

power to decide whether nuclear power plants

18

would be constructed.

19
20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Well, but that -­

that -­

21

MR. COOPER:

That's a (c) activity.

22

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

I'm sorry to

23

interrupt, but I just want to narrow the

24

question so that we might be more productive,

25

for -- for me, helpfully for me.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
8
1

There, California was regulating

2

construction.

And that's -- that's dealt with

3

by (c), but (k), I grant you, 2021(k), does

4

seem to have a carveout based on purpose.

5

MR. COOPER:

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

7

Yes.
You got me there,

okay?

8

(Laughter.)

9

MR. COOPER:

10

Yes.

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But I think Justice

11

White was saying, well, within the construction

12

world, all right, we have this carveout under

13

(k) that we have to deal with, and California

14

might regulate construction for purposes other

15

than safety considerations, for economic or

16

other considerations.

17

What do we do about it when -- when a

18

state comes along and says, I'm not even going

19

to regulate construction, I'm not even going to

20

get into that game, I'm not in the (c) game at

21

all?

22

look at anything?

23

this is just not an area that Congress

24

regulated?

25

agreement on how to regulate mining?

Why would we look at (k)?

Why would we

Why wouldn't we just say

Congress just couldn't come to

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
9
1

MR. COOPER:

Well, to come back to

2

PG&E, what the -- what California regulated was

3

not construction.

4

construction.

5

It -- it preempted

It pretermitted construction.

And what the Atomic Energy Act gives

6

the NRC regulatory control of is how a plant is

7

constructed.

8

California answered the whether.

9

So, before you get to the how,

And it -- and this Court acknowledged

10

that that was within its authority.

11

it couldn't do was use that de jure authority

12

over whether to effectively and indirectly

13

regulate the nuclear safety of the operation of

14

the plant.

15
16

But what

The State of Virginia is doing exactly
the same thing here.

17

It's using its -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose -- suppose

18

Virginia had said we think that the extraction

19

is a dangerous activity, so we are justifying

20

this ban on mining to protect the workers from

21

the hazards associated with mining, not with

22

milling or tailing, just mining.

23

Then I take it you would lose, right?

24

MR. COOPER:

25

yes.

I would lose, Your Honor,

I would lose if that was the State of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
10
1
2

Virginia's genuine purpose.
What the Congress has -- asks the

3

courts to do is to determine the purpose of a

4

-- of a state regulation, state regulations

5

ranging in the -- in this body of law from a

6

state very creatively denying municipal

7

services, such as fire and police, sewer,

8

garbage, to restricting access on its public

9

roads in order to -- to -- to -- to use those

10

sovereign powers in order to prevent the -- the

11

-- coming into existence the regulatory power

12

of the NRC in the first place.

13

And that is what PG&E says, quite

14

reasonably, states cannot do.

15

that, it would make a mockery -- as this Court

16

said in the National Meat Association case,

17

would make a mockery of the purpose-based

18

preemption standard that Congress has

19

prescribed.

20

If they could do

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I might just

21

be repeating Justice Gorsuch's question, but

22

you've conceded, if they talk about mining

23

hazards, that that's -- you lose.

24

appreciate the candor.

25

And I

But what if the legislation is written

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
11
1

to protect against mining hazards and of the, I

2

don't know, 60 members of the legislature, 20

3

of them say this is a great way to keep nuclear

4

energy out of the state and we should do that?

5

What is the purpose of that

6

legislation?

7

hazards, or do you look behind it and it says,

8

well, a third of them thought it was a good way

9

to keep nuclear power out?

10
11

Still to protect against mining

How -- how do you

analyze that question?
MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, the -- the

12

courts can't accept simply as written what the

13

state may say in terms of what the purpose is.

14

That's -- that's exactly what happened in the

15

Entergy case from the Second Circuit.

16

The -- the legislature in Vermont was

17

acutely aware of PG&E and acutely aware of

18

trying to avoid preemption.

19

face of the statute, it articulated non-safety

20

rationales for what was, the court of appeals

21

determined, its -- its concealed purpose, which

22

was radiation hazards of nuclear power

23

generation.

24
25

And so, on the

So the -- the courts really have to
look behind to see if, in fact, the -- the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
12
1

legislature is motivated and its purpose is a

2

prohibited radiation hazard.

3

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Is this going to

4

require deposing every single legislative

5

member?

6

MR. COOPER:

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

No, Your Honor.
Because what do

In a lot of these things, people
They don't say why.

Or they do

10

what one of my colleagues suggested, they give

11

mixed motives.

12
13

This is an odd way to read a
preemption statute.

14

MR. COOPER:

Your Honor, I know of no

15

case, that I'm aware of anyway, when this Court

and the federal courts go about the what is

17

ordinary business of trying to determine

legislative purpose, where legislators have

been deposed.

20

mind.

21

That is not what we have in

What the courts look to in these cases

22

are the standard, ordinary indicia of -- of -­

23

of objective purpose.

24

By the way, the text in this case says a lot

25

about that.

What does the text say?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review

But what is the legislative history?

What are the historical contexts of -- of the

3

legislation itself?

addressing?

5

What was the legislature

What -­

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But you would concede,

6

Mr. Cooper, that two states with exactly the

7

same statutes, it could come out different ways

8

because the legislative history was different

9

in the two states?

10

MR. COOPER:

It -- it -- it could,

11

Your Honor, if -- if the purpose animating the

12

legislature through the best good-faith

13

examination of the court's looking at that

14

issue came to the conclusion that, yes, this

15

genuine and non-prohibited purpose was the

16

but-for purpose, if you will, of the

17

legislation.

18

Yes, that -- that is -­

19

JUSTICE KAGAN:

It seems to present

20

real opportunities for gamesmanship as well,

21

sort of bad incentives for a state.

22

over your purpose?

23

MR. COOPER:

Just cover

Your Honor, and we've

24

seen that -- we've seen that in -- in cases

25

that have been decided in -- in this line.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

As

Official - Subject to Final Review
14
1

I was saying, the -- the Entergy case itself,

2

the legislature was very careful to attempt to

3

obscure what was, and the courts determined

4

quite properly, what was genuinely animating

5

the legislative body in that case.

6

And it's not unusual in this

7

particular area.

And when -- when Congress

8

determined to create a system of dual

9

regulation and drew the line between the

10

purpose of the state to regulate radiation

11

hazards, it was reserving for the federal

12

government that particular area with good

13

reason.

14

It was allowing the states to regulate

15

in the area of electric generation as they had

16

always done and to -- if -- if -- if the states

17

would have regulated this particular plant as

18

though it was a fossil fuel plant, then there

19

would be no doubt that its purposes were not

20

nuclear safety.

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But how are we

22

going to tell that in most cases?

Justice

23

Kagan's question about two state laws are going

24

to be treated differently based on our inquiry

25

or the federal court's inquiry into the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
15
1
2

subjective motive seems very odd.
The thing that concerns me about this

3

is, how is this going to work?

4

MR. COOPER:

5

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Your Honor -­
And -- and one way

6

would be, as Justice Sotomayor said, subjective

7

motivations depositions.

8

think, that that's not what you're looking for.

9

You rightly say, I

So what's -- what is it?

You ask

10

whether the state can articulate a legitimate

11

non-safety rationale, that's -- that's a

12

possible answer.

13

MR. COOPER:

14

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

15
16
17
18

That's -- that's -­
But that's too

low, I think you're going to say.
MR. COOPER:

You're right, I am going

to say that, Your Honor.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But then what do

19

-- what -- what is the answer, for something

20

workable that makes sense here?

21

that's what's bothering me.

22

MR. COOPER:

That's what -­

Your Honor, I think if -­

23

if you're -- if you're groping, if you were,

24

for a framework for courts to analyze this, it

25

seems to me the Court in Arlington Heights

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
16
1

produced a perfectly apt way for courts to

2

approach this.

3

If the -- the person, the plaintiff

4

challenging the preemption of the statute can

5

demonstrate that the prohibited purpose was a

6

motivating factor, then the state has to come

7

in and show that it would have been enacted

8

even in the absence of the motivating factor.

9

And, again, the -- the -- the Congress

10

drew the line here because it wanted to ensure

11

-- and this was -- purpose is actually in this

12

a narrowing preemption because, typically, if

13

-- if the state enacts a measure, regardless of

14

what its purpose is, that is an indirect

15

regulation of that which is exclusively

16

federal.

17

case, the court doesn't look into what the

18

purpose was.

19

properly.

20

As in the National Meat Association

It simply preempts it, quite

This actually takes -- takes the

21

standard preemption doctrine and its state -­

22

it's friendlier to the state's interests

23

because it allows states, as (k) explicitly

24

says, to regulate the materials at issue -­

25

source, byproduct, and special nuclear

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
17
1

materials -- for purposes other than protection

2

against radiation hazards.

3

But, when it comes to something that

4

dramatically important, protection against

5

radiation hazards of these nuclear materials,

6

the Congress wanted that to be exclusively

7

federal, and so it drew the line on -- on

8

purpose.

does seem to me that when you're talking about

obvious dual authority between the federal

from the separation involved in the PG&E

19

context?

20

So isn't the separation

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

So my -- my answer

21

to your question is no.

22

by reference also to the facts of some other

23

cases.

24
25

And if I could explain

Take Skull Valley, for example.
There, the state, everyone agreed, had complete

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
21
1

authority over the use of the roadways.

2

what the state couldn't do was effectively shut

3

down a spent nuclear fuel facility by

4

preventing any fuel from reaching the facility

5

in the first place by way of the roads.

6

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But

General, I -- I -- I

7

understand that's a nice Tenth Circuit case, so

8

well done.

9

(Laughter.)

10

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But it doesn't bind

11

this Court.

So what do we do about -- I'm

12

stuck where Justice Kagan is, and so it's not

13

going to help me to cite a Tenth Circuit case,

14

I'm sorry, colleagues.

15

(Laughter.)

16

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But I -- I want to

17

know from first principles why PG&E isn't

18

simply explained as a construction case.

19

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

20

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Sure.
And construction, I

21

don't see whether and how in the statute in

22

(c).

I see construction, period.

23

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

24

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

25

Right.
And California was

regulating construction in some fashion.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
22

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.

And I -­

Here -- here, it's

3

mining.

And maybe Congress should have

4

preempted in mining, instead of just starting

5

with milling, but it didn't.

6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

7

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

8
9

Yeah.
So why isn't that

the end of the case?
GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Because I think

10

the answer to your question is that neither

11

PG&E nor anything that we're arguing here is

12

really a nuclear-specific rule.

13

Take the National Meat Association

14

case, for example, a decision of this Court.

15

The federal government had exclusive regulatory

16

authority over slaughterhouse operations.

17

what the Court made clear was that the state

18

couldn't use its authority over the sales of

19

meat to reach into and indirectly regulate

20

slaughterhouse operations.

And

21

Here, the purpose inquiry actually

22

narrows the scope of preemption because not

23

only does the state have to use the authority

24

that it does have to reach into and indirectly

25

touch upon something that the federal

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
23
1

government regulates, it has to do so for a

2

very specific and impermissible purpose.

3

And I think that if you adopted a

4

contrary rule, unlike the one adopted by the

5

Fourth Circuit, it really is a road map for

6

completely undermining a multibillion-dollar

7

industry.

8

And that, Your Honor, is the reason I

9

was citing Skull Valley, not because I believe

10

that the holding obviously is binding on this

11

Court, because its facts show that a state

12

could simply shut down all nuclear activity by

13

designating the roadway leading up to a nuclear

14

plant as unsuitable for commercial trucking,

15

even if the only commercial trucks that ever go

16

up that roadway are to make deliveries to the

17

facility.

18

JUSTICE KAGAN:

But a problem -­

19

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, purpose is

20

usually a subjective concept, but -- and that's

21

what Congress -- that's the term Congress chose

22

to use in 2021(k), but is there a way of

23

understanding that as applying an objective

24

standard that doesn't boil down to rational

25

basis review?

So the inquiry wouldn't be what

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
24
1

was in the minds of these particular

2

legislators, but would a reasonable

3

legislator -- is -- do -- enact this particular

4

prohibition if its objective was not

5

disagreement with the federal regulations?

6

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes, Your Honor, I

7

think there is.

And -- and, Justice Kavanaugh,

8

I think this also goes to the concern that you

9

were raising as well.

10

I think that the way you would analyze

11

this is by looking at the text, the legislative

12

history, the historical context in which it was

13

enacted, and the plausibility of any

14

permissible non-safety rationale that the state

15

puts forward.

16

If the state puts forward a plausible

17

non-safety rationale and that rationale is not

18

otherwise foreclosed by the text, legislative

19

history, and historical context, then I think

20

the state wins.

21

The problem in this case is that the

22

Fourth Circuit effectively assumed that the

23

purpose of this law was to prohibit uranium

24

processing because uranium processing was

25

unsafe.

But it held that that was simply

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
25
1

irrelevant to the disposition of the case.

2

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

But, General, even

3

under your standard, we have a problem of mixed

4

motives, because every piece of legislation has

5

a variety of motives behind it.

6

of congressmen with a lot of different

7

purposes.

8
9

We have a lot

I'm not sure I understand how you're
going to solve the problem.

In Virginia, we

10

have in this record evidence that they're

11

concerned both about -­

12

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

13

JUSTICE GORSUCH:

Right.
-- environmental and

14

economic impacts from mining itself, as well as

15

with other things.

16

So what do we do with those cases

17

where, at the end of the day, it's

18

indeterminate?

19

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

So two responses,

20

Your Honor.

The first, which I'll get off of

21

quickly because I -- I don't think you're going

22

to find it fully responsive, is that you don't

23

have to address that here because the Fourth

24

Circuit refused to apply any purpose inquiry at

25

all.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
26
1

But, secondly, I think that the answer

2

lies in where the burden of proof is.

3

burden of proof is on those challenging state

4

law.

5

principal or predominant purpose of this law

6

was impermissible, then they lose.

7

The

And if they cannot establish that the

And so, here, the Fourth Circuit

8

refused to undertake any inquiry at all because

9

it effectively assumed that the purpose was in

10

Petitioners' favor but concluded that that was

11

irrelevant.

12
13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Any plausible

non-safety rationale, that's your test?

14

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I think, if it's

15

not foreclosed by the text, legislative

16

history, and historical context and they can

17

establish a plausible rationale at the time

18

that this was adopted, then, yes, I think that

19

--

20

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

So that answers

21

Justice Gorsuch's question because, if there's

22

at least one plausible non-safety rationale,

23

that's good enough or -­

24
25

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I think that

plausible non-safety rationale has to be

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
27
1

sufficient to sustain the law.

2

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

What does that -­

3

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

So, for -­

4

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

-- what does that

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

So, for example,

5

mean?

6
7

suppose that Virginia put forward a rationale

8

of we don't like big, huge, ugly holes dug into

9

the Virginia countryside, which is a very

10

plausible rationale.

11

particular area of Virginia they actually have

12

tons of big, ugly holes dug in the Virginia

13

countryside by way of coal mines.

14

But suppose that in a

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

I thought they

15

just said we don't want -- we've got too many

16

but don't want any more.

17

JUSTICE BREYER:

18

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yeah.
Well, Your Honor

19

-- and I think that that's exactly the type of

20

analysis that the statute itself requires when

21

it required that type of purpose inquiry,

22

because I do think otherwise -- otherwise, you

23

really are giving state and local governments a

24

road map for undermining a multibillion-dollar

25

industry.

Just one other example.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
28
1

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Well, General, you -­

2

you've been talking about the undermining of

3

this industry, but I guess a couple of things

4

is, one is that as long as there is this other

5

purpose or as long as the state can say that

6

there's this other purpose, it will just as

7

successfully be able to undermine the industry.

8
9

And then on the -- on the -- as well,
this statute does give the federal government

10

the ability to make sure that states can't

11

really undermine it if the federal government

12

wants a nuclear industry badly enough, because,

13

in addition to the fact that somebody can

14

import this material from another state or from

15

another country, the federal government itself

16

can mine for this material on its own lands, or

17

it can condemn lands and -- and do it with

18

newly acquired lands.

19

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

20

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Sure.

So there's a limit to

21

how far any state is able to undermine the

22

federal goal here if the federal goal is real

23

enough.

24
25

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

I agree, Your

Honor, but two responses to the first part of

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
29
1

your question, and then I'd like to address the

2

second part of your question as well.

3

On the first part of your question, we

4

assume that the states engage in good faith,

5

and we assume that the states aren't going to

6

misstate their reasons for doing something.

7

But I will tell you that it is a lot

8

more difficult for a state to, for example,

9

rezone all land that nuclear activity is taking

10

place on as residential, even if it's totally

11

unsuitable for residential dwelling, if they

12

know they're going to have to come forward and

13

justify that.

14
15

And may I finish the second point,
Your Honor?

16

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

17

GENERAL FRANCISCO:

Yes.

Briefly.
In my -- in

18

response to the second part of your question,

19

Justice Kagan, yes, the federal government can

20

in certain circumstances condemn land.

21

take not something like this case, but take

22

something like an ongoing nuclear facility

23

where the state is using, under the Fourth

24

Circuit's rule, its authority to rezone that

25

land as residential to completely obstruct it

Heritage Reporting Corporation

But

Official - Subject to Final Review
30
1

and shut it down.

2

It is a lot more difficult for the

3

federal government to come in and condemn an

4

entire operating nuclear power plant.

5

Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. HEYTENS:

Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
This is an obstacle preemption case

masquerading as a field preemption case.

is no field preemption here because of the

Commission does not and cannot regulate any

18

aspect of uranium mining, including the safety

19

aspects of uranium mining.

20

There

And there is no obstacle preemption

21

here because the Atomic Energy Act and the

22

Nuclear Regulatory Commission have repeatedly

23

reaffirmed that states have the ability to

regulate mining up to and including by banning

25

it altogether.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

They -- they can

regulate milling, correct?

3

MR. HEYTENS:

Excuse me, I want to

4

make -- the federal government regulates

5

milling -­

6

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

7

MR. HEYTENS:

8
9

Right.

-- Justice Kavanaugh,

yes.
JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Yeah.

So the

10

mining and milling occur together, correct?

11

other words, they occur -- you don't have

12

mining without milling; you don't have milling

13

without mining.

14

MR. HEYTENS:

In

Justice Kavanaugh,

15

there's a way -- the in situ leaching process,

16

they literally occur at the same time.

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

conventional mining.
MR. HEYTENS:

I'm sorry, yes, you have

to mill before you can mine.

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

22

MR. HEYTENS:

That's correct.
Right.

But -- but I think in

23

many ways what this case boils down to is two

24

questions about Pacific Gas, either one of

25

which is sufficient to resolve this case in our

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
32
1

favor.

2

The first question is why the Court

3

conducted a purpose analysis in Pacific Gas,

4

and the second question is what is the nature

5

of the purpose analysis that Pacific Gas did.

6

So let me take the first question:

7

Court do it.

8
9

why did the

The reason the Court did it is
because, as several members of this Court have

10

already flagged, Pacific Gas was dealing with

11

an area of overlapping shared authority between

12

the federal and state government.

13

the yellow brief dwells on this, so I want to

14

quote some of the language in the Court's

15

opinion that addresses this.

16

And I know

The Court said at page 194 of its

17

opinion that that case arose at an issue

18

involving the intersection of federal and state

19

authority.

20

of its opinion that it was involving the dual

21

regulation of nuclear-powered energy

22

generation, and the -­

23

The Court said at pages 211 and 212

JUSTICE ALITO:

Before you get too

24

deeply into that decision, which you have

25

addressed very extensively and well in your

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
33
1
2

brief, could I just ask you this:
Suppose the Virginia General Assembly

3

enacted a law that reads as follows:

4

General Assembly disagrees with the federal

5

government that uranium tailings can be safely

6

stored in Virginia and, for that reason and

7

only that reason, we are banning the practice

8

of uranium mining.

9
10

The

Would that be preempted?
MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Alito, we do not

11

think even that mythical statute would be

12

preempted.

13

explaining why we don't think that, and then

14

I'll explain why I don't think the answer to

15

that matters in this case.

16

And let me -- I'll start by

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, how would that

17

be -- I mean, doesn't that make nonsense of

18

2120 -- 2021(k)?

19

MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Alito, I don't

20

think it does and here's why:

21

predicate for 2021(k) is the existence of an

22

NRC-regulated activity.

23

I think the

2021(k) has to be read in pari materia

24

with 2021(b).

2021(b) also refers to purpose,

25

and it says that in a situation where the state

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
34
1

negotiates for the discontinuance of commission

2

authority, the state again gets the right to

3

regulate those activities for purposes of

4

health and safety.

5

And then 2021(k) comes along and says:

6

Just because you haven't gotten a 2021(b)

7

agreement doesn't mean you can't regulate for

8

other purposes.

9

JUSTICE BREYER:

So why -- why can't

10

the -- you know, the imagination allows you to

11

think of all kinds of things where they stop

12

the tailing.

13

plant can eat.

14

not going to be a real law.

15

No one who works in a tailing
All right?

You know, that's

But they can't eat, they can't have

16

electricity in the plant, they can't build it

17

in the first place because it's residential.

18

You name it, they have authority in all kinds

19

of places and all they have to do to stop the

20

tailings is they use this other authority

21

solely in order to stop the tailings, and you

22

say that's just fine.

23

MR. HEYTENS:

Well -- well, Justice

24

Breyer, I think there are two different reasons

25

why that's distinct from this situation.

JUSTICE BREYER:

I know the eating is

distinct, but what I'm driving at is the

general matter of -- of I were in a state

6

ways, my guess, is we stop tailings in our

you do it in a way that nobody can build a

And that's what they

say happened here.

17

MR. HEYTENS:

Yes, and I think the

18

answer to your question, Justice Breyer, goes

19

back to a point that Justice Gorsuch made

20

earlier.

21

about a plant, we are talking about dual

22

overlapping federal and state authority under

23

2021.

In that situation, if we're talking

JUSTICE BREYER:
question.

But that's not my

It's the tailings they can't

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
36
1

regulate.

You get my question?

2

MR. HEYTENS:

Yes, Justice Breyer.

3

JUSTICE BREYER:

A good lawyer, like

4

you, and he finds a different area, and it just

5

turns out that the regulation in this different

6

area will stop them from ever having tailings.

7

And that's why they did it.

8

that's my problem.

9
10

MR. HEYTENS:

Okay?

So -- so

Just -- let me try this

again, Justice Breyer.

11

When we're talking about a tailings

12

facility, we're in an area of overlapping

13

authority because NRC regulates tailings

14

management.

And at that point, you are covered

15

by 2021(k).

And the Court has to conduct the

16

sort of purpose analysis that's mandated by

17

2021(k).

18

Our submission is that this case is

19

fundamentally different because we are

20

regulating mining -­

21

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

But, when you're

22

regulating mining, you're always regulating

23

milling because you have the two together, but

24

you can't regulate milling, as you acknowledge,

25

but the two are interlinked in a way that I'm

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
37
1

not sure you can disaggregate in the way you're

2

doing.

3

MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Kavanaugh, I

4

understand that conceptually we -- we could

5

have a metaphysical debate about whether you

6

can separate mining and milling and whether -­

7

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

It's -- in the

8

real world, it's not separated.

9

MR. HEYTENS:

Well, Justice Kavanaugh,

10

in the statute, it's separated.

11

judgment, they're separated.

12

And in NRC's

I think the best evidence of that is

13

discussed in our brief.

14

Resources decision of NRC.

15

in which NRC is regulating an activity that

16

they have the authority to regulate.

17

milling process.

18

It's the Hydro
So this is a case

It's a

Right?

And NRC has argued that, as part of

19

their regulation of milling, they should take

20

into account background radiation that exists

21

because of previously un-NRC regulated mining.

22

And NRC says we can't do that.

We're

23

not allowed to take into account the

24

consequences of previous mining activities

25

because we, NRC, have no authority to regulate

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
38
1

mining.

2

regulate milling, we, NRC, can't regulate

3

mining.

4

that exists because of that previous mining

5

would constitute impermissible NRC regulation

6

of mining.

7

Even though we have authority to

And even taking into account radiation

And so I think regardless of whether

8

as a metaphysical level we could say milling

9

and mining are so inextricably intertwined that

10

the regulation of one is necessarily the

11

regulation of the other, I think both Congress

12

and the text of the statute, right, I mean, so

13

that's the other point, this statute from the

14

beginning has given NRC the ability to regulate

15

milling.

16

And in the entire history of this Act,

17

NRC has never once advanced the argument, as

18

far as we're aware, that says because we can

19

regulate milling, a fortiori we can regulate

20

mining because mining is inextricably

21

intertwined with milling.

22

In fact, NRC has aggressively

23

disclaimed that argument in a decision where a

24

great deal actually turned on that argument.

25

But the second question to raise,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
39
1

Justice Breyer -- to go back to Justice Breyer.

2

So I think the first reason that Justice

3

Breyer's example isn't covered by this

4

situation is that we concede, once we're

5

dealing with an NRC-regulated activity, a

6

tailings facility, 2021(k) requires some sort

7

of purpose analysis.

8

a purpose analysis in Pacific Gas.

9
10
11

That's why the court did

JUSTICE KAGAN:

And that's also why

Skull Valley is right?
MR. HEYTENS:

Yes, Justice Kagan,

12

because the vast majority of the activities in

13

Skull Valley were NRC-regulated activities.

14

And we have no quarrel with that decision

15

whatsoever.

16

But the other reason is even if -- so,

17

to go back to Justice Alito's hypothetical,

18

excuse me -- even if it appeared on the face of

19

the statute, the first reason we think that

20

that law is not preempted, and if that law's

21

not preempted, this law is obviously not

22

preempted, but even if the Court were inclined

23

to reserve judgment or to carve out an

24

exception for a law where that sort of purpose

25

is stated on the text or the face of the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
40
1

statute, there would be no justification for

2

unleashing the, all things considered,

3

subjective motivations of the state legislature

4

that we see in the blue brief and the yellow

brief.

6

And, here, I think what -­

that where we're looking to the future.

Name any judge in American history,

and who's been heard of, of course, we have a

25

wrong with looking at purpose here?

So what's
I grant

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
41
1

you a state legislature, unlike Congress, is

2

less likely to hold on the record hearings

3

about a statute, but then that would be a

4

reason for saying, when we try to determine

5

purpose, we do not look necessarily to

6

legislative history as written in committee

7

reports because there aren't any.

8

Now there Justice Scalia and I could

9

have a lot of arguments about whether you do,

10

whether you don't, but that's beside the point.

11

When you say don't look at purpose, there I get

12

off the boat because I think that's our job as

13

a court in -- in a relevant case to determine

14

what the purpose of the statute is.

15

it's easy.

Sometimes

Sometimes it's tough.

16

So what's wrong with what I just said?

17

MR. HEYTENS:

18
19

I think I have two

answers, Justice Breyer.
The first one is that when we're

20

dealing with a state legislature, which is

21

fundamentally, as you say, unlike Congress, and

22

it's unlike Congress in a different way.

23

state legislature does not have to show its

24

authority to do something.

25

Under our federal system, the

Heritage Reporting Corporation

A

Official - Subject to Final Review
42
1

challenger has to show why a state legislature

2

may not do something.

3

say is we'd have to know why would the purpose

4

of this law matter.

5

think, something that was brought up by Justice

6

Gorsuch, our fundamental view is, because

7

Congress does not regulate mining in any way,

8

in any shape, or any form, it does not matter

9

the purpose for which Virginia has chosen to

10

So the first thing I'd

And to go back to, I

forbid mining.

11

But even if the Court wanted to carve

12

out an exception for the case that we've talked

13

about earlier, I think -- I think, Justice

14

Breyer, you're absolutely right.

15

purpose of the statute is an Orthodox question

16

of statutory interpretation and should be

17

determined the way the Court normally does.

18

The face of this statute regulates

I think the

19

mining.

20

environmental and natural resources

21

consequences that flow from mining.

22
23
24
25

The face of this statute cites

JUSTICE ALITO:

And what does that

mean?
JUSTICE GINSBURG:
mean by that?

Now what do you

You had it in your brief.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Let's

see.

You said there was a plausible purpose

2

other than to prevent nuclear development.

3

And you say the possibility that

4

certain impacts of uranium development activity

5

may reduce or potentially limit certain uses of

6

Virginia environmental resources, and -- and I

7

-- I don't know what that means.

8
9

MR. HEYTENS:
Ginsburg.

Fair enough, Justice

I mean, I think -- we think it's

10

fairly apparent what those would mean in the

11

context of this situation.

12

This would be a massive earth-moving

13

mine operation.

14

the federal government's cert stage amicus

15

16

pounds of uranium, you have to displace one ton

17

of dirt to get one to five pounds of uranium.

18

There's a statistic that's in

This would be a massive disruption of

19

Virginia's stated view.

We're talking about a

20

fundamentally profoundly rural area of Virginia

21

that's building its economy based on

22

agriculture and tourism.

23

fairly obvious how that would have a

24

significant impact on Virginia's environment

25

and natural resources, which is why this -­

And I think it's

Heritage Reporting Corporation

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:

Well, how much

2

is -- I'm trying to envision -- you know, one

3

ton sounds like a lot, but a ton of dirt, how

4

-- how much is that?

5

probably not that much.

6

talking a truckload or what?

7

That's not -- it's

MR. HEYTENS:

I mean, are you

Perhaps, Mr. Chief

8

Justice, but our friends on the other side -­

9

it's also not one pound of uranium.

Our

10

friends on the other side say this deposit is

11

100 -- I believe it's 119 -- it's either tons

12

-- it's an enormous quantity.

13

They're not -- they don't want to mine

14

one to five pounds of uranium.

15

mine what they themselves describe as the

16

largest deposits of uranium in the continental

17

United -- in the United States.

18

JUSTICE ALITO:

They want to

Well, Virginia allows

19

coal mining and has a fair amount of coal

20

mining in the western part of the state.

21

could a court compare coal mining with uranium

22

mining and see if there's something that if one

23

is more disruptive to the scenery than the

24

other or one is more dangerous to miners than

25

the other, something like that?

Heritage Reporting Corporation

So

Official - Subject to Final Review
45
1

So you could ask whether it's

2

plausible that this was done for some reason

3

other than just the fact that Virginia

4

disagrees with the NRC that the tailings can be

5

dealt with in a safe way.

6

MR. HEYTENS:

And, Justice Alito, I

7

think there is an apparent and obvious

8

explanation that is all -- that the Court

9

doesn't need to do anything beyond -- it's

10
11

something the Chief Justice flagged.
There is -- Virginia could easily

12

decide that there is a world of difference.

13

mean, the analogy I've thought of here is the

14

removal of Ten Commandments monuments, right,

15

where Virginia could easily decide that there

16

is a world of difference between telling people

17

and companies and communities that have built

18

their economic livelihood around coal mining

19

that we are not going to shut those down and

20

disrupt the entire way of life in an area.

21

I

There's a world of difference between

22

saying that, and we do not intend to start a

23

massive mining operation in a part of the state

24

that has never had such a mining operation.

JUSTICE ALITO:

there is a well-known, sometimes laughed at,

And it brings me back to my answer to Justice

Kagan and Justice Ginsburg.

Excuse me.

The statements in the brief that they

where we say the Court should not consider

6

these hundreds of pages of statements where

I'm hearing is rationale basis review.

could vote for that?

16

what you're asking.

17

top of it introduces all of the complications

18

that Justice Kagan has alluded to, which is, if

19

we're going to start inquiring into purpose,

20

one state may not be able to do the same thing

21

another state may be able to do simply because

22

of our assessment of what was in somebody's

23

mind.

24
25

Is

Okay, fine, if that's
But to layer purpose on

And if we start looking at this
statute, I don't even know where to begin,

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
51

because it talks about the environmental and

2

local resource impacts of mining and milling

3

and tailings and everything else.

4

Now could a rational legislator have

5

done this only for concern about mining?

6

Maybe.

road of what's in somebody's head and

8

subjective intentions of even an imaginary,

9

hypothetical reasonable legislator, I don't

10
11

If I'm going to start going down the

know.
MR. HEYTENS:

Well, Justice Gorsuch,

12

we absolutely agree with you, which is why our

13

primary submission is that, because this is not

14

an area that's regulated by the federal

15

government at all, you don't do any sort of

16

purpose analysis.

17

That -- our primary submission is that

18

exactly what you just said, Justice Gorsuch,

19

that there's no warrant to do that, there's no

20

need to do that, and the Court shouldn't do it.

21

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

Well, except where

22

do we draw the line or how do we draw it

23

between the Skull decision and the Second

24

Circuit Vermont decision?

25

that the state were -- were alleged to be doing

There, activities

Heritage Reporting Corporation

regulated conduct by the federal government.

3

But one could say here, if you

4

prohibit mining, you're affecting milling or

5

disposal.

6

MR. HEYTENS:

Right.

7

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:

So how -- where

8

and how do we draw the line between that

9

regulation that we're permitted to look to

purpose for and that which we're not?
MR. HEYTENS:

Right.

The line, we

12

think, is straightforward.

13

text of the statute.

14

activity, because, in both the Skull Valley

15

decision and in the Entergy decision, the state

16

law was directly acting upon and regulating

17

something that is itself regulated by NRC.

18

It's based on the

It's NRC-regulated

The spent nuclear fuels facility in

19

Skull Valley was regulated by NRC.

20

21

22

now I want to bring up the roads provision

23

because Mr. Cooper mentioned them.

24
25

The Vermont

And the Court would do -­

They say there's this one provision of
the law at issue in Skull Valley that turns a

Well, I'D say two things about that

3

provision.

4

Utah did, all Utah did was to convert a road

5

from a county road to a state road, and that's

6

the only thing they did, there would be no

7

basis whatsoever for finding that law standing

8

alone was preempted by the Atomic Energy Act.

9

First, if that's literally all that

And to the extent that it operated -­

10

I think there was also discussion of the

11

National Meats case, which I think is

12

affirmatively helpful for us because, at the

13

end of the opinion in National Meat, the Court

14

got to the sales provision of the California

15

law and the Court said:

16

directly act upon the conduct that's regulated

17

by federal law.

18

an argument, and the Humane Society made the

19

argument, that's not preempted.

20

You know, this doesn't

And so I guess you could make

And here's what the Court actually

21

said in National Meat.

22

the way that the sales provision operates

23

within state law as a whole.

24
25

That argument ignores

California didn't enact the sales
provision as a free-standing provision.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

They

Official - Subject to Final Review
54
1

enacted the sales provision as part of an

2

interrelated series of laws that in the court's

3

language regulated the same thing as the

4

federal government, just in a different way.

5

And we think that's directly on point,

6

because when this Court CVSG'd in Skull Valley,

7

the Solicitor General's CVSG brief adopted that

8

precise rationale when it came to the roads

9

provision.

It said the roads provision has to

10

be analyzed as part of how Utah's entire scheme

11

is regulating the spent nuclear fuels facility.

12

You have to look at the scheme as a

13

whole and you have to look at how the entirety

14

of the series of interrelated laws work.

first, in this case, we're not talking about

10

11

material.

12

critically important -- I don't think I'm just

13

quibbling over terminology -- is because, when

14

we're talking about source material, both 2090

16

We're talking about source

JUSTICE ALITO:

Well, it goes on to

say the disposal of such other byproducts

18

source or special nuclear material.

19

MR. HEYTENS:

Correct.

But it -- but

20

you have to read that in conjunction with 20 -­

21

2092 and 20 -- 2095, both of which specifically

22

say that NRC jurisdiction over source material

23

does not even begin or commence until after

24

that source material is removed from the

25

ground.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
56
1

Congress was very clear.

They have a

2

belt-and-suspenders approach.

3

say that NRC can't regulate the transfer of

4

source material.

5

They don't just

That's 2092.

They go even further in 2095, and this

is an extraordinary provision.

NRC from even requesting reports about source

material until after it's out of the ground.

9

NRC has literally no authority over source

fact that the NRC has -- occupies the field of

regulation of source material?

After it leaves the

the critical distinction in this case because

20

our whole point that -- the predicate of our

21

argument -­

22

JUSTICE ALITO:

Yeah, but if the -- if

23

-- if a state law indirectly, surreptitiously

24

regulates the same thing, it would fall within

25

the prohibited field.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
57
1

MR. HEYTENS:

Justice Alito, I guess

2

I'd have to know -- I'd have to have a little

3

more information about what we mean by

4

"indirectly or surreptitiously regulates the

5

same thing," because it's certainly -- if -- if

6

we're talking about Petitioners' strong version

7

of that argument, that is completely

8

inconsistent with this Court's rejection of a

9

field preemption argument in Pacific Gas,

10

because think about the argument that

11

California -- excuse me, not California -- that

12

Pacific Gas and the federal government made for

13

preemption in that case.

14

Of course, allowing the nation's

15

largest state to prevent nuclear power

16

construction -- nuclear power plant

17

construction, of course, that is going to have

18

a profound impact on the civilian nuclear power

19

industry in the United States.

20

acknowledged that, and the Court said:

21

understand, California could do that, but we've

22

concluded that Congress has nonetheless given

23

California the right to regulate for economic

24

safety reasons.

25

for this Court -- this is what the Court

And the Court
No, we

And it is for Congress, not

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
58
1

specifically said in Pacific Gas -- if Congress

2

concludes that California is misusing the

3

authority that has been left to them, it is for

4

Congress to tell the state that.

5
6
7

And I'll just go back to the point
that -­
JUSTICE KAGAN:

But, of course, Mr.

8

Heytens, not for reasons having to do with

9

radiological safety.

10

MR. HEYTENS:

11

JUSTICE KAGAN:

Yes.
And I suppose one way

12

to understand this -- the preemptive field here

13

is that it surely extends to various kinds of

14

activities, and this is not one of those

15

activities, the mining.

16

But, in addition, it extends to

17

judgments about radiological safety, even

18

outside those activities, on the theory that

19

the NRC is the proper body to make judgments

20

about radiological safety and we don't want 50

21

states to be making their own.

22

So I suppose that's a -- a way to

23

explain the opposite position.

24

MR. HEYTENS:

25

I agree with that,

Justice Kagan, but I think the very last thing

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
59
1

you said shows why that argument can't possibly

2

be right.

3

NRC lacks the authority to regulate

4

even the radiological safety aspects of mining.

5

So the logical -- if you define the field that

6

way, the logical implication of that argument

7

is that there is literally no one who has the

8

authority to regulate radiological safety

9

aspects of uranium mining, because the NRC

10

can't do it, because the NRC has repeatedly

11

reaffirmed that they have no power to do

12

anything.

13

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

Aren't the

14

radiological safety issues posed by the milling

15

far more than the mining?

16

why you're concerned about the milling.

17

Justice Alito's point, it's a way to prohibit

18

the milling, you can't do that; let's prohibit

19

the mining, that way we prohibit the milling,

20

of the reason that Congress has given NRC

jurisdiction over the milling is because of

4

those various concerns.

-- on phrasing.

The Solicitor General said plausible non-safety

11

say plausible non-radiological safety

12

rationale?

13

I assume you would amend that to

MR. HEYTENS:

Yes, I would, Justice

14

Kavanaugh, and I think that's consistent with

15

what they've said in their briefing.

16

at the cert stage, they said we could regulate

17

mining, even the safety aspects of mining, as

18

long as we're doing it based on the mining.

I think,

19

And -- and to take your point, Justice

20

Kavanaugh, I think there's three possibilities.

21

There's the radiological safety aspects of

22

uranium sitting in the ground.

23

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

24

MR. HEYTENS:

25

Right.

There's the radiological

safety aspects of the mining process.

Heritage Reporting Corporation

And

Official - Subject to Final Review
61
1

there's the radiological safety aspects of the

2

milling.

3

reason you give NRC jurisdiction over the third

4

is the conclusion that that poses special

5

concerns.

6

I -- I agree with you completely the

JUSTICE KAVANAUGH:

It's all of the

7

concerns, isn't it, on radiological safety?

8

Almost all?

9

MR. HEYTENS:

I -- I want to amend it

10

to almost all, Justice Kavanaugh.

11

there's discussion in some of the briefing in

12

this case that suggests that there are

13

radiological concerns associated with the

14

mining process itself.

15

sitting in the -- excuse me -- a committee

16

report from 1946 says that, sitting in the

17

ground, uranium does not create radiological

18

safety concerns.

19

question of whether the process of digging it

20

out of the ground raises any radiological

21

safety concerns.

22

I know

Congress said that

But there's the separate

And I think there's at least some

23

evidence in some of the briefing that there may

24

be at least some radiological safety concerns

25

associated with doing that.

Without saying

Heritage Reporting Corporation

Official - Subject to Final Review
62
1

they're the same as milling.

2

And there -- regardless of whether

3

there are radiological safety concerns, there

4

are clearly a wide variety of health and safety

5

concerns associated with extracting massive

6

amounts of material out of the ground.

7

And so we think that, at the end of

8

the day, the purpose -- this Court has

9

reaffirmed repeatedly that the purpose of a

10

statute includes not only what it sets out to

11

change but also what it resolves to leave

12

alone.

13

And we think the single clearest and

14

completely dispositive decision by Congress in

15

this case was the decision it made in 1946 that

16

it reaffirmed in 1954 and has left undisturbed

17

until the present day, that the federal

18

government does not regulate uranium mining.

19

For that reason, Virginia's inherent

20

sovereign ability to control something as

21

fundamental as what material gets pulled out of

22

the ground remains fully intact, its ban should

23

not be preempted, and this Court should affirm.

24

Thank you.

REBUTTAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES J. COOPER

4

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

6

MR. COOPER:

Thank you, Mr. Chief

Justice.

7

And, Justice Kavanaugh, I want to come

8

straight to your point that you cannot mill

9

mining unless you have -- mill uranium unless

10

you have mined it in the first place.

11

There were two ways for Virginia to

12

prohibit milling and tailings management, both

13

of which they were concerned about.

14

weren't concerned about radiological aspects of

15

-- of mining qua mining any more than the NRC

16

is.

It's the milling and the tailings that

preemption.

23

They could do it directly.

We prohibit

There's no way it could do -­

JUSTICE GINSBURG:

Suppose -- suppose

-- suppose they say our rationale does have to

25

do with the mining, not the milling; we think

Official - Subject to Final Review

there are radiological hazards from -- from the

2

3

said that.

4

MR. COOPER:

Suppose they

Your Honor, they could

5

say that, but a court would have to look behind

6

it, would have to look behind at using all the

7

techniques that my friend, the Solicitor

8

General, has mentioned, including plausibility.

9

But, to come back, Justice Kavanaugh,

10

I want to make clear that the Court understand,

11

as Justice Gorsuch has referenced, that the

12

statute that banned mining had sister

13

provisions.

14

enacted a -- a uranium administrative group,

15

tasking it with the -- with the responsibility

16

to study uranium mining in -- in Virginia and

17

milling and tailings.

18

refer the Court to 185 through 187.

19

In the very same breath, Virginia

On page 185 -- I would

With respect to milling activity, the

20

capacity -- these are things that they're

21

supposed to study -- the capacity of the mill,

22

the process to be used in milling and ore

23

extraction, the reagents in processing

24

material, the method for conveying tailings and

25

wastewater from milling.

The next paragraph, with respect to

tailings management, the quantity and

3

characteristics of the tailings, the method of

disposal, treatment systems for the removal of

5

6

several pages -- pages.

7

The -- the courts below and my friends

8

for the Commonwealth have focused myopically on

9

the one sentence that is the ban.

What was

10

really happening here and the purpose of this

11

was to prohibit milling and tailings

12

management, the only thing that really

13

represents serious radiological hazards.

non-safety rationale.

17

Solicitor General.

19

like rational basis review, like any

20

conceivable thing that -- that the state could

21

bring forward or a judge could even conceive of

22

will do the trick.

23

This is the one place

That sounds too much to me

That's not what Congress had in mind

24

when it said:
