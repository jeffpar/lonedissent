ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS

MR. MORRIS:

We will have arguments

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court, the respondent, Nicholas

10

Romano, entered a plea of guilty in November of 1976 to

11

two felony counts of the transfer and sale of a

12

controlled substance.
The record indicates that Romano had sought to

trade 26 pounds of marijuana to a person who turned out

15

to be an undercover police officer in exchange for

heroin.

consequently keep Romano out of prison.

with any in which a person might ba sent to pris on, and

2

the ccurt also remarked that Romano’s past track record

was not very good.

Nevertheless, the court said, because this was

not a personal crime, a crime against a person, he was

brought about the revocation.

imprisonment, Your Honor.

Under Missouri law,

MR. MORRIS;

It is up to five years?
Excuse me?
It is up to five years.

17

ultimately reached the Missouri Supreme Court and was

summarily denied.

20

In any case, the Romano respondent filed

federal habeas corpus petition —

21

QUESTION:

22

MR. MORRIS;

Where is he now?
Mr.

Romano, of course, was

23

discharged as a result of the ruling of the District

24

Court.

25

QUESTION;

So he is free?

He is free.

As a matter of fact,

2

at the time the District Court rendered its ruling,

3

Romano was on parole.

4

incarceration, was placed on parole, and the effect of

5

the District Court’s decision was to discharge him from

6

parole supervision.

7

QUESTION;

8

MR. MORRIS:

9
10

How long did he serve before that?
He served approximately -- he

served from — approximately five, a little over five
years, I believe.
QUESTION;

11
12

He served a period of

And if the case is reversed, as you

would like it to be, what would be the result?
MR. MORRIS:

13

Your Honor, our basic contention

14

is that — and as

15

later, is that the revocation hearing was entirely

16

valid, and that being the case, we submit that he should

17

be restored to parole supervision.
QUESTION;

18
19

20

I will get into in much more detail

Yes.

For what additional period cf

time?
MR. MORRIS;

It is rather a substantial

21

additional period of time.

I think he is currently —

22

until the District Court’s decision reversing his —

23

overturning his revocation, I think he was scheduled

24

be on parole until the turn of the century, 2000 or

25

thereabouts.

to

1

The District Court in granting this habeas

2

corpus petition professed to find in this Court's

3

decisions of Morrissey versus Brewer and Gagnon versus

4

Scarpelli- a procedural due process requirement that any

5

revoking authority, revoking court or presumably a beard

6

in a probation or parole revocation case was required to

7

specify on the records that it considered various

8

alternatives to incarqeration,

9

said included driver training classes and public service

10

and restitution and such like, and that the court is not

11

only required to specify that it considered such

12

alternatives, but it must specify as to why it rejected

13

them.

14

which the District Court

The District Court in fact said if this was

15

not done on the record at-the time of the revocation

16

that the revocation is not only invalid but perpetually

17

so.

18

for an evidentiary hearing in which the state circuit

19

judge might have been called to testify about his state

20

of mind.

21

The District Court refused the petitioner's request

The Eighth Circuit affirmed this, what we

22

submit to be a novel principle even though it had

23

previously rejected a similar attempt in a federal

24

probation revocation case called United States versus

Burkhalter.

He left the scene, and about 12 hours later

QUESTION*

Any evidence taken on whether he

was under the use of drugs at that time?
MR. MORRIS*

No, Your Honor, there is no

12

evidence of that, and of course because Mr. Romano

13

absented himself for eleven hours, we have no idea as to

14

his condition when he was driving, which is not a direct

15

issue in this case, but it is something --

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Anything in the judge’s action that

indicated that he took that into account?
MR. MORRIS:

No,

Your Honor, it wasn’t

19

something that was discussed.

20

QUESTION*

As a matter of Missouri law, upon a

21

revocation, did the judge actually have any alternative

22

except to do what he did?

23

MR. MORRIS;

Well, that is a matter of some

24

uncertainty, Your Honor.

The petitioner and respondent

25

dispute, and Missouri law really hasn't settled whether

or not, for example, the court could reduce the sentence

2

that was originally imposed, instead of 20 years, put it

3

down to ten years.

4

appellate cases.

It just simply hasn't come up in

I believe it is safe to conclude that the

5

6

court could have changed the terms of his probation or

7

imposed some other sort of equitable remedy, not that

8

there is any direct authority for it, but that has been

9

the procedure in the past.

10

There has been no problem

with that.

11

The petitioners submit that the decision of

12

the Eighth Circuit below is not only not supported by

13

Morrissey and Gagnon but is directly contrary to it and

14

is net consistent with any reasonable due process

15

analysis .
QUESTIONi

16

Has there been any practice in

17

Missouri of violation of a condition of probation

18

automatically to reimpose the prison sentence?
MR. MORRISi

19

20
21

I am not sure I understand the

question.
QUESTIONi

When a revocation of probation is

22

sought and the only thing that is established is that

23

there has been a violation of the condition of

24

probation, automatically is there any practice of

reimposing the sentence?

MR. MORRIS;

Your Honor, I really have no

statistics on the subject.

done.

QUESTION;

6

MR. MORRIS;

It is just something — I

It is?
Yes, I think that is fair to

7

say.

8

probation revocations at the trial level, but I have

9

that impression.

10

I don't have any — I am not an attorney who does

In Morrissey and Gagnon, this Court

11

acknowledged a significant liberty interest in

12

revocation and probation and parole.

13

said, I think perfectly correctly, that there are two

14

stages to a revocation decision, the first being whether

15

a person is guilty of the alleged probation or parole

16

violation, and the second is what this Court called the

17

predictive and discretionary decision as to whether he

18

should be sent to prison or what other disposition

19

should be made of this person because of the violation.-

20

And the court

The Court stated that both of these questions

21

involve factual bases.

Obviously, the first decision,

22

the guilt decision is almost entirely factual, but even

23

when one is talking about a decision on sentencing after

24

one finds that a violation of probation has been

25

committed, this Court said it is important to know not

(202) 628-9300

1

only that some violation was committed, but also tc knew

2

accurately how many and how serious the violations

3

wer e.

4

Thus, this Court established a framework, a

5

procedural framework whereby the facts of the case, the

6

facts pertinent to both these issues would be reliably

7

and fairly determined.

8

the procedure it was requiring under the due process

9

clause in Morrissey as an informal hearing structured to

This Court described the remedy,

10

assure that the finding of a parole violation would be

11

based on verified facts, and that the exercise of

12

discretion would be informed by an accurate knowledge of

13

the parolee's behavior.

14

And this Court expressly in Morrissey rejected

15

the concern that this procedure that it was mandating

16

would impair or affect the exercise of discretion.

17

said, a simple factual hearing will not interfere with

18

the exercise of discretion.

20

doing in this case, and that is exactly what respondent

demands.

case that the facts of this matter were not adequately

23

developed, that the state circuit court was not fully

24

aware of all pertinent facts both pertaining to the

person's guilt of the revocation and to enable him to

Rather, what they are asking, and what the

Eighth Circuit is saying can be done and should be dene

4

as a matter of federal constitutional law is that for

5

the federal habeas court to look into the mind, based

6

purely upon the record, of the state revoking judge or

7

revoking authority and say that that court or authority

8

did net use the right mental process in arriving at its

9

conclusion.
And I submit respectfully that that is

10
11

completely beyond the contemplation and beyond the

12

policy that was stated by this Court in Morrissey and

13

Gagnon.

14

QUESTION*

Well, in the view of the Eighth

15

Circuit, Mr. Morris, was there some way that a trial

16

court could have satisfied this requirement, like making

17

findings of record or something like that?

18

MR. MORRIS;

That is how I understand the

19

Eighth Circuit and the District Court's requirement to

20

be, that the court is required to make some sort of

21

record statement by which it can be determined what it

22

was thinking about when it made the decision on

23

sen tencing.

24
25

It must say, I consider A, B, C, D, and E as
alternatives to incarceration, and I don’t think they

And again, that

5

Now, the respondent has very heavily relied

6

upon one passage in this Court’s decision in Morrissey,

7

and it was in the early part of the decision, in Part 1

8

of the decision, in which this Court said, as I just

9

mentioned before, that there are two stages, the stage

10

of determination of guilt of the violation and the

11

decision on sentencing.

12

He has not only cited this over and over

13

again, but he cited lower court state and federal cases

14

that simply quoted the language, as if the language

15

supports his conclusion.

16

petitioners submit, is that this language was a purely

17

factual statement in this Court's opinion.

Exactly the same thing could be said that this

21

Court said in Morrissey about a criminal trial.

22

could say that there are two stages in a criminal trial,

24

offense charged, and if he is guilty whether he should

25

be sent to prison or put on probabion or whatever the

Yet this Court has repatedly recognized in

2
3

cases too numerous -- I can cite several,

but this

4

Courth has well established that as a matter of

5

constitutional law one cannot review the sentencing

6

discretion of the state court unless the sentence itself

7

is inherently unconstitutional, or there is some other

8

due process defect.
This Court has, in Roberts versus United

9

10

States, United States versus Grayson, and other cases,

11

has acknowledged that that area is not a constitutional

12

question.

13

QUESTION!

May I ask, going back to my earlier

14

question, supposing the Missouri law really does allow

15

the judge to exercise a variety of options in this

16

situation, but the judge made a statement on the record

17

that made it perfectly clear that he thought he had no

18

option, that he thought he had to do it as a matter cf

19

law, and it later turned out he was wrong.

20
21

22

Would that be a ground for a collateral attack
like this on the sentencing.
MR. MORRIS;

Your Honor, I submit not, because

23

our position is that there is no and should be no

24

constitutional requirement that a judge consider

25

alternatives to incarceration.

That is at a stage just

QUESTION:

As long as whatever he does is

3

within the range of permissible conduct at the time,

4

then there is no constitutional review at all?

5

ME. MORRIS*

Well, I admit that is a rather

6

close question, because this Court has acknowledged

7

that, for example, in the sentencing context a sentence

8

can be invalid because the court employs an improper

9

information or impoper factual background for its

10
11

sentencing.
QUESTION:

Can that be taken away from him

Absolutely, Your Honor, I agree

18

it cannot, but that is exactly what this Court specified

in Morrissey and Gagnon, and that is exactly what it has

20

been providing.

21

QUESTION:

I suppose as a practical matter if

appellate courts.

chose to make to the appropriateness of the sentence.
MR. MORRIS:

Respondent had two attorneys at

8

the hearing.

Evidence was introduced, and there was

9

after the evidence full argument by both sides.

10

The other language in Morrissey that has been

11

relied upon besides the two step language, which again,

12

we submit, is not constitutional in its character, is

13

the admittedly constitutional requirement that the

14

revoking authority state the evidence it relied upon and

15

the reasons for revoking probation.

16

The respondent has sought to draw this into

17

what he believes to be the constitutional right to

18

consideration of alternatives to incarceration, yet that

19

requirement is easily understandable as permitting and

20

facilitating an appellate review of the decision to

21

revoke probation.

22

For example, in this Court’s decision in

23

Douglas versus Bruder, this Court held that due process

24

was violated because the person who was revoked, there

25

was no evidence to support a finding that he had

Particularly where you have multiple charges

2
3

of probation violation, obviously a finding is essential

4

to allow a court to make that sort of decision.

5

Similarly in Bearden versus Georgia, there had, to be

6

something on the record to indicate that the probationer

7

was revoked because he could not pay his restitution.

Tell me, at the revocation hearing,

did the respondent’s attorneys argue. Your Honor, you

10

12

alternatives and tell us why you don't adopt one of

QUESTION!

16

MR.. MORRIS;

No, sir, he -That argument was not made?
Nothing regarding the

17

appropriateness of a sentencing decision was said.

18

Their only theory at the revocation proceeding was that

19

he was not guilty of leaving the scene of an accident,

20

and that was their evidence, and that was their

21

argument.

22

There was nothing else.
In the present case, as far as the finding, a

23

finding requirement is concerned, there was only one

24

issue at this revocation hearing, and that was, again,

25

whether or not he was guilty of leaving the scene of an

accident
The court indubitably found and expressly and

3

extensively found that he was indeed guilty of leaving

4

the scene, and the court said based upon the evidence

5

that he discussed and the credibility of the witnesses

6

he discussed, the court said based upon this evidence,

7

this probation is revoked.

8
9

The court has by its finding, which is in the
Joint Appendix, in the last few pages,

the court has by

10

its finding stated the evidence upon which it relied and

11

the reason for revoking probation, and that is all that

12

this Court has ever asked of a revoking authority, be it

13

a court or a parole board.

14

Had respondent originally been sentenced to

15

imprisonment, there is no dispute that there would be no

16

requirement, and respondent has not attempted to dispute

17

that there would be no requirement that alternative

18

incarceration be specified by the sentencing court.

19

Although we acknowledge that there may be some

20

difference in terms of liberty interest, although

21

frankly I find it very hard to analyze what liberty

22

interest or what due process principles apply to

23

sentencing, because this Court really hasn’t directly

24

addressed it, we submit that the two decisions are

qualititatively the same, and in fact in many cases,

QUESTION;

Mr. Morris, what is your position?

15

Is it that the finding of the trial court and -- the

findings of fact and determination to revoke probation

17

simply implicitly meets a requirement that alternatives

18

be considered, or is it your position that no

19

alternatives need be considered, period?
MR. MORRIS*

20

The latter, Your Honor.

Our

21

position is that there is or there should be, there has

22

never been in the past, at least, any requirement that

23

alternatives to incarceration is a constitutional

24

question.

The purpose of the statement of the revoking
21

authority is to show that it has — the facts upon which

2

it relies to permit appellate review of its decision on

3

that subject, and that is pretty much the extent of the

4

stat ement.

5

There is no requirement according to the
1

6

state's position that there be alternatives to

7

incarceration considered because this is a matter no

8

longer of fact, which Morrissey and Gagnon cover, but of

9

discretion.

10

It should be clear, I think, why the State of

11

Missouri and the 19 other amici curiae states oppose

12

this holding of the lower court.

the notion of saying in every case in which one has a

20

new and creative alternatives that the revoking court

21

did not consider.

22

On top of that, we submit, and the respondent

has cited no cases, and we are not aware of any, in

This Court should require and should hold that

the due process clause, the Fourteenth Amendment

requires that trial judges should state on the record

whether alternatives should be considered before

10

make this holding and follow this holding for three

11

principal reasons.

12

First, it is the precedent of this Court, a

13

12-year precedent in the landmark decisions of Morrissey

14

versus Brewer and Gagnon versus Scarpelli.

15

cases this Court stated that alternatives to

16

incarceration should be considered before a trial judge

17

revokes probation.

18

state cases which have applied that rule, have it

19

applied it consistently and uniformly.

21

this issue.

There is a two-step rule

First is the issue of whether a probation

Now, do you think Morrissey against Brewer as

22

you interpret it would require the state judge in that

alternatives to imprisonment.

Yes, Justice Rehnquist.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

think it would be unconstitutional under Morrissey and

QUESTION;

Then you say that one of the

5

holdings of Morrissey and Gagnon is that a state may net

6

provide by statute for a granting of probation,

7

suspending imposition of sentence, granting of probation

8

on the condition that if probation is revoked for

9

violation of a condition, that you automatically go to

10

jail.

I think your interpretation would come as a

11

surprise to a lot of people.
MR. CHERRICK:

12

Your Honor, we submit that all

13

state and federal courts that have interpreted this

14

issue have held that, and as Justice O'Connor wrote in

15

the Bearden — excuse me — yes, in the Bearden

16

decision, that sentencing courts daily throughout this

17

land consider alternatives to incarceration.

18

that, we submit, because they are following Gagnon and

19

Morrissey.

20

QUESTION;

Yes, of course, counsel.

They do

However,

21

in Bearden, we had a situation of a person who was

22

unable to live up to the terms of probation through no

23

fault of his own, and Bearden in no way involved a

24

probation revocation based on conduct at which the

25

defendant was at fault, did it?

MR. CHERRICKi

Yes, Justice O’Connor.

2

However, the Court noted in Bearden that fault was not

the standard by which the alternatives to incarceration

requirement should be considered.

5

that Bearden stands for the proposition that this issue

6

must be decided, as the Eighth Circuit said, on a case

7

by case basis.

8
9

Indeed, we believe

There can be no bright line drawn as to when
alternatives to incarceration must be considered.

There

10

are an infinite amount of factual possibilities as to

11

what the underlying crime is and what the probation

12

revocation is.

13

on its facts.

14

That indeed is why Bearden was decided

The Court was able to look at those particular

15

facts and state under those particular facts that an

16

indigent who fails to make restitution, it would be

17

fundamentally unfair to revoke probation without

18

considering alternatives under those facts.

19

QUESTION:

Well, do you think it is

20

fundamentally unfair to automatically sentence someone

21

to the original sentence that is imposed after the

22

finding on the first offense after the probationer

23

commits a new crimiijal offense?

24
25

MR. CHERRICKi

Justice O’Connor, the fact that

a probationer commits a crime is not the issue in a

13

QUESTION;

revoked, no matter whether it is significant and whether

21

it has any relationship to the underlying offense,

22

whether it reflects that the probationer can no longer

For example, if a probationer does not report,

to whether Judge Whipple in this case considered

alternatives to incarceration at the revocation hearing,

3

but the record does say something very interesting, and

4

that is at the sentencing hearing Judge Whipple told Jim

5

Romano in no uncertain terms that he was prepared to

6

revoke the probation for any violation.

7

We suggest that while that possibly may have

8

been hyperbole on the judge's part,

if indeed Judge

9

Whipple thought that was the law, it violated Morrissey

10

and Gagnon and deprived Romano of his due process

11

rights, because on the face of it his conduct involved

in the probation violation had no rational relationship

to the underlying crime.

always freighted with the conditions of parole.

Certainly that liberty interest was burdened with the

it?
-HR. CHERRICK;

13

That is true, and the only —

and the condition of parole or probation in this case

15

that was relevant was the general condition in which

16

Romano stated, I will obey all the laws of the state cf

Missouri.

If this Court does not hold that reasons or

this Court in effect will be

saying that if a person runs a stop sign or gets a

automatically revoke probation, that that is

fundamentally fair.

Mr. Chief Justice, no, because

15

to significant due process rights.
A person who has been convicted of a crime has

been constitutionally deprived of his due process

MR. CHERRICKs

5

Justice O'Connor, as to the

6

remedial question, first, it is supported under Missouri

7

law, and under Missouri law once a probation term has

8

expired, the court must release the probationer from all

9

custody.

As that original probation hearing was

10

unconstitutional, Romano spent the maximum term of

11

probation is five years in

jail.

12

The trial judge in this case, District Judge

13

Cahill, an experienced judge -- sat on the state bench

14

for five years, and in the same position as Judge

15

Whipple, sat as a state judge in St. Louis — was well

familiar with this law and ruled that the probation term

17

had expired.
