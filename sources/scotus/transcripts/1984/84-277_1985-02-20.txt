PROCEEDINGS

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

I think you may proceed

whenever you are ready, Mr. Frankel.
ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN E. FRANKEL, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. FRANKEL:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court:
In 1981 in Widmar against Vincent, this Court
held that a public university, the University of Missouri,

10

where it had opened its meeting rooms to over 100 various

11

groups of students for various kinds of speech and dis­

12

cussion was forbidden by the free speech clause to deny

13

such a meeting room to a group of students, a cornerstone

14

group, wishing to hold prayer and religious discussions.

15

In this case here on certiorari to the Second

16

Circuit, that Court has held that the Village of Scarsdale

17

in Westchester, under the rule of Widmar and Vincent,

18

is compelled or required to allow a group of Christian

19

churches and their Christian adherence to place and leave

20

a creche or nativity scene in a small public park in

21

the center of the village for a period of two weeks or

22

so around the Christmas season.

23

QUESTION:

Mr. Frankel, I am concerned about

24

your interpretation of the Court of Appeals' opinion.

25

It seemed to me at least in looking at it the Court of
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Appeals said that the city could adopt reasonable time,

2

place and manner of restriction.

3

restrictions might incorporate a provision that unattended

4

displays will not be permitted in the park.

5

that such a restriction would be one that the city could

6

properly adopt under that opinion?

7

8

MR. FRANKEL:

Presumably those

Do you think

Your Honor, I think there are

various ways the municipality could approach this problem.

9

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that that opinion

10

would permit the city to adopt the regulation that I

11

suggest?

12

MR. FRANKEL:

13

QUESTION:

Very possibly, Your Honor.

It isn't true that the Court of

14

Appeals has required the city to permit unattended displays

15

such as a creche.

16

MR. FRANKEL:

Your Honor, it is as true that

17

there is such a requirement here as it was in Widmar

18

against Vincent which has been applied by the Circuit

19

to this case.

20

of Missouri, presuambly they could adopt time, place

21

and manner regulations.

22

abolished their meeting rooms.

23

When the case went back to the University

For example, they could have

What we say is in this case that what Scarsdale

24

has done without time, place and manner regulations so-

25

called is constitutional; that there is no such thing

1

required under the First Amendment as an open public

2

forum for unattended statues, symbols, structures, and

3

signs, and that therefore Widmar and Vincent does not

4

apply to this case; that the Circuit should be reversed

5

as things stand under the way that Scarsdale has run

6

its parks up until now.

7

QUESTION:

Do you think that the display of

8

a creche or a cross or something symbolic of that kind

9

is symbolic speech?

10

MR. FRANKEL:

Yes, Your Honor.

We have never

11

denied that.

12

agree to it, Your Honor, but we embrace it as I hope

13

to show in the argument as I might mention right now.

14

My friend says we dispute it.

This is a free speech case.

We not only

It goes off on

15

the free speech clause.

16

was a free exercise claim which was rejected properly

17

and properly abandoned.

18

At some earlier point, there

Under this conception of the free speech clause,

19

if Scarsdale in its existing situation with such regula­

20

tions as it has and doesn't have must allow a creche,

21

then it must allow a sign saying Vote Republican, it

22

must allow a swastika, it must allow a sign saying Support

23

Planned Parenthood.

24

QUESTION:

25

Well, I suppose if it is speech,

we don't normally suppress it on the grounds that some
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

people find it offensive, do we?

2

MR. FRANKEL:

We don't normally, Your Honor,

3

provided that you are dealing with a public forum where

4

people are allowed to express themselves in the manner

5

in question.
QUESTION:

6

Well, is the city park a public

7

forum?

Could anybody go out there and speak in favor

8

of Nazism or some other offensive topic?
MR. FRANKEL:

9

Yes, Your Honor.

It is a public

10

forum under Hague and the CIO and all the cases decided

11

by this Court up to now, but not for unattended symbols

12

that --

13
14
15

QUESTION:

Why doesn't the city just say that

and say we have a rule against unattended symbols?
MR. FRANKEL:

Your Honor, the city has said

16

it in the first case that raised the problem in a contro­

17

versial fashion.

18

to place a hammer and sickle in Boniface Circle and the

19

village had denied the request, it would have behaved

20

properly provided it stated a principle that as decent

21

and neutral.

22

If the first case had been an effort

As the Solicitor General of that city says,

23

the village, which is not a legal institution, not less

24

than the courts certainly, may proceed case by case to

25

the problems as they come before it.

1

This, in the whole history of Scarsdale, appears

2

to be the only object offered for placement on a park

3

that has been controversial.

4

In the prior history of Scarsdale there have

5

been about six kinds of things in the park and I might

6

say, I hope without arrogating, that I think the Scarsdale

7

park in this sense are like the parks of America generally

8

that all of us know.

9

communal and in some sense innocuous symbols like the

What you have had is friendly,

10

Red Cross, the United Fund, Community Fund, American

11

Field Service, and that is about it.

12

QUESTION:

Well, if the city rules, as you

13

described it, one that says we will not allow unattended

14

displays if they are controversial or if the engender

15

confronters.

16

MR. FRANKEL:

Your Honor, as of today I think

17

the fair answer to Your Honor's question is yes as the

18

rule is evidence by practice.

19

had one controversial symbol presented to it.

20
21

22

That is to say it has

I might say that in the non-controversial symbols,
even the Red Cross, the United Fund and so on as this
record shows, each one has been presented by the Village

23

Manager to the Board of Trustees and they have considered

24

each one for its aesthetic suitability which cities and

25

municipalities can do in the use of their property, and,

indeed,

2

then in terms of their impact, as the record shows, on

3

the sensibilities of the residents of the village and

4

it has made it determinations accordingly,

5

saying you may put the Red Cross on this piece of land,

6

not Boniface Circle, which is the place that has always

7

been demanded, but on some other park.

It is considered

Our record shows that nobody thus far has ever

tried to compel the village to emplace a symbol that

10

it believes in its local judgment is offensive to a large

11

proportion of the village residents for whom those parks

12

are held in trust for all of them, who all support it

13

and who all pay the expense of maintaining it.

14

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Frankel -- I think

15

you perhaps read the judge -- Judge Pierce's opinion

16

somewhat more broadly than I do.

17

at what seems to me the operative sentence on page 25A

18

of the Petition, the second sentence in the conclusion.

19

He says,

20

prohibiting the village from relying on the establishment

21

clause as a reason for prohibiting the erection of a

22

creche at Boniface Circle, a traditional public forum,

23

for a period of approximately two weeks."

24
25

I was just looking

"We remand for the entry of an injunction

Now,

if that was the reason the village gave,

surely it could come back and give any number of other

8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

reasons other than that that the Second Circuit would

2

probably sustain.

3
4
5

MR. FRANKEL:

Your Honor, I want to say two

or three things in response to that question.
First, Judge Pierce goes on and says "it is

6

remanded for action regarding a disclaimer sign or signs

7

and for other such action as is consistent with our deter­

8

mination herein."

9

Now, the location the court used in Widmar

10

could have been exactly the same one.

11

had relied on the establishment clause as its defense

12

against allowing cornerstone to use those rooms.

13

But, let me go further.

Missouri University

We argue that on our

14

first and basic proposition that Widmar does not apply

15

here, reversal is required without ever reaching the

16

establishment clause because we say that the notion of

17

an open, public forum in this case, which is a novel

18

case after all, has never been applied to require munici­

19

palities to allow in their parks unattended symbols that

20

are offensive to a great many of the people for whom

21

those parks are held in trust.

22

QUESTION:

But, might not that depend on the

23

reason you give for turning down the request for an

24

unattended symbol?

25

MR. FRANKEL:

Your Honor, we have given the
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

reason first, of course, in our brief, but if you look

2

through the record of this case you will find the reasons

3

and they are not stated in the form of legal brief.

4

The village trustees, including one rather eloquent and

5

articulate lawyer named Oman summarized their views under

6

a number of headings and the main was that to place this

7

Christian symbol in the shared park was unneighborly

8

and was offensive to a great many of the people who share

9

those parks.

10

11
12

Another reason given was, according to one
or more of the trustees, the establishment clause.
QUESTION:

Do you defend the right of the village

13

to refuse to place the creche for two weeks on the grounds

14

that it would violate the establishment clause?

15

MR. FRANKEL:

We do, Your Honor, but we say

16

that without that defense we win any way because just

17

as we argue that the village does not have to allow a

18

display like the one that was held "protective" in

19

Brannenberg and Ohio.

20

not have to allow a display showing some hooded Klan

21

figures and a sign saying Send the Blacks Back to Africa

22

and the Jews Back to Israel.

23

A village in Mississippi does

We say and assert that no village in America

24

has ever allowed such things and none is required to

25

under the free speech clause.
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

We say by the same token though -- I take the

1

2

example of offensive symbols that are more widely offensive.

3

We say by the same token this is true of the creche.

4

The creche may well be and is to a majority not a hateful,

5

but a cherished symbol.

6
7

QUESTION:

has allowed other uses of the park?
MR. FRANKEL:

8
9

But what if the village in the past

Your Honor, we have to look at

those and I might say if I had to take one case of this

10

Court's precedence to rely on I think I would take Perry

11

Association, both the majority and the dissent, and I

12

think we would win on either one.

13

it was held that the mail boxes were not a public forum

14

for communication of the kind attempted although the

15

incumbent union could communicate through them, the out

16

union, the minority union, could not.

sustained and the Court analyzed the kinds of public

18

property -- and that is what I use the case for -- that

19

we classify for this kind of purpose.

20

21

is the government property that is not a public forum

22

at all.

23

There you will recall

Now, that was

There is the open,

Now, I say that the park in this case, for

24

purposes of unattended structures and symbols, is not

25

an open, public forum; that the uninhibited, robust,
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

and wide-open debate that the First Amendment assures

2

for speakers and speech does not extent to cluttering

3

the parks with controversial symbols to stand there and

4

beguile or benumb the residents as they walk in those

5

places.

6

Therefore, I say that the doctrine of Perry

7

applies here and Perry said it didn't matter that the

8

alleged forum, the communication device given by the

9

government could be used by the YMCA and some other civic

10

kinds of associations.

11

12

13

certain kinds of communications you may be required to

14

allow similar kinds of communications.

17

18

tions to put up their signs and nobody disputes that.

19

If somebody with a similar sign wanted to put his up

20

or hers, I suppose the village would have to be consistent.

21

But, within the terms of Perry, it is not required that

22

the village allow a Klan symbol, a hammer and sickle,

23

a sign that says God Doesn't Hear the Prayers of Jews,

24

or any other of the kinds of expression that people

25

are free to make orally in public parks, but that we

2

of the First Amendment, under the decisions of this

3

Court which have never squarely reached this somewhat

4

interesting question and we say never should be.

we say that the Circuit must be reversed without ever

reaching its establishment clause argument though we

reach it.

QUESTION:

And,

But, you do insist that leaving

these unattended symbols in the park would be an establishment
of religion, is that your position?
MR. FRANKEL:

We do take that position and

12

let me say that I will try to reach it and I will reach

13

it in a few minutes.

14

QUESTION:

Because that seems to me to be

15

the heart of the Second Circuit's decision which was

16

that the city shouldn't be able to rely on the establishment

17

clause to keep --

18
19

MR. FRANKEL:

It is, Your Honor, but the Second

Circuit, with all deference --

QUESTION:

21

MR. FRANKEL:

I understand your other argument, but —
Well, it skipped point one.

It

22

skipped point one and that is why I make it point one.

23

You don't find a word in the Circuit's opinion whether

24

there is --

They did.

They certainly disagreed with your

Your Honor, the other ground that

MR. FRANKEL:

I will come directly to that, but

I want to preserve the important argument that you won't
find a word in the Circuit's opinion about a subject in

our view, rather eloguently treated by Judge Stewart in

2

the District Court, about the difference between an unattended

3

symbol setting on the land giving its message when its owners

4

aren't there, called the Scarsdale Creche Committee, though

5

the majority of its proponents don't even live in Scarsdale.

6

QUESTION:

7

MR. FRANKEL:

8

QUESTION:

That is the way you avoid Widmar.
That is the way —

At least you say Widmar doesn't cover

9

a situation like that.

10

MR. FRANKEL:

That is correct, Your Honor.

Now,

11

let me -- We say Widmar doesn't cover and logically because

12

it doesn't cover the Circuit must be reversed without reaching

13

the establishment clause, but let me reach it.

14

That, of course, brings us to last year's decision

15

in Lynch against Donnelly and I want to state quickly what

16

we think are the salient distinctions between that case

17

and this one.

18

QUESTION:

Before you get to that, Mr. Frankel,

19

I am not sure I track your emphasis on unattended.

20

they had two persons, one on each side of the creche, ringing

21

a bell or doing something, would that make any difference?

22

MR. FRANKEL:

Yes, Your Honor, it would.

Suppose

We think

23

as an exercise of the right of a live speaker to speak the

24

speaker may probably bring with him or her a symbol, a sign.

25

QUESTION:

Then you think it would be all right?

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. FRANKEL:

I think it would be all right,

because then it becomes clear that it is that speaker's

3

message that is being delivered.

5

QUESTION:
he leaves.

6

Here --

How about once the speech is finished,

He has to take the symbol with him.
MR. FRANKEL:

He takes the symbol with him, exactly,

7

and that has been touched upon in more than one of this

8

Court's cases, most recently Taxpayers against Vincent.

9

Let me illustrate a little further, Your Honor.

10

One of the Plaintiffs in this case, Mr. Charles Butler,

11

was asked and said he never goes down to Boniface Circle

12

even to look at the creche.

13

that the creche must be there but he is not there.

14

is there?

15

Honor?

16

half or more of the people who put it there don't even live

17

in Scarsdale.

Nobody is there.

This is Scarsdale's

MR. FRANKEL:

It says it is placed there by the

Scarsdale Creche Committee, the Scarsdale Creche Committee,
a private organization.

11

QUESTION:

Just as the --

So, it is a little hard if you look

12

at the sign to attribute the sponsorship to the city, isn't

it?

14

MR. FRANKEL:

No, it is not hard at all, Your

Honor.

16

record, find that it is a mingling of the public property

17

with this private message that gives a kind of sense of

18

sponsorship and identification.

And, many of the people, as is stipulated in this

QUESTION:

Well, do you think if the city allowed

20

a speaker on the subject of Christianity to speak at the

21

park that the people would attribute that sponsorship to

22

the city?
MR. FRANKEL:

No, Your Honor, they would attribute

24

it to that speaker, but, you know, in this case again we

25

have to use the facts of the case.

was offered by

a group of Christian clergymen the use of

church properties to rotate the creche upon and they said,

no, putting it at a church property would defeat the

ecumenical aspect of their creche.

5

couldn't you put a sign there and say this isn't this church's

creche, this is the creche of the Scarsdale Creche Committee.

7

No, that was not an acceptable solution and they are right,

Your Honor, because people walking by seeing the object

Well, they were asked,

Others say, well,

10

if it is the Scarsdale Creche Committee's creche, what is

it doing here?

12

The village must at least view it with benign

13

approval or acquiescence or something.

there undoubtedly and it is perceived as such by some of

15

the people who share the ownership of this municipal property.

16

And it was held to offend on that ground by a majority of

those people's elected representatives.

And, you have a court ordering

We say that is a significant

This Court sustained that judgment

Here, the local officials have concluded they

I do object to that characterization

10

of the opinion of the court below which again appeared at

11

least to say the city could have a neutral restriction,

12

for example, banning all unattended displays.

13

hard to turn that order of the court into what you say is

14

an affirmative order to display it.

15

MR. FRANKEL:

So, it is

Your Honor, until the Solicitor

16

General made that suggestion -- and this doesn't bind the

17

court — let me say none of the parties have felt that this

18

could go back and the Second Circuit could look at it again

19

and the Scarsdale board could debate it some more.

20

all construed the opinion as saying Scarsdale must allow

21

the creche.

22

Now, we could be wrong.

We have

Let me assure the Court

as a realistic matter that if this case goes back and it

is affirmed it will be deemed an order to allow the creche.

(Laughter)

11

MR. FRANKEL:

12

Oh, I think so, Your Honor, I think

I feel I have accomplished something,

Your Honor.

13

Let me pursue the distinctions of Lynch briefly.

14

Here you have a creche on the public land with all the problems

15

of aura and identification to which I have spoken.

16

you have a creche that in this circle stands quite alone

17

as the pictures show dearly in the record, is not surrounded

18

by all the things in the display involved in Pawtucket.

19

Our friends, with all the rollicking humor that we lawyers

20

enjoy, talk about count of reindeer and teddy bears and

21

so on.

22

and the Court wrote is that the constant emphasis on that

display it must be deemed in our view to be meaningful if

24

not decisive in itself.

record, you have a history of long, bitter divisiveness.

2

You have divisions in the Board of Trustees, you have voters,

3

including one of the Plaintiffs, saying our vote is affected

4

by the way the Trustees do with the creche, you have candi­

dates for office telling their position on the creche, and

we say you don't have the prediction that the Chief Justice

made in Lemon and Kurtzman but the fact of divisiveness of

the kind that is a factor in our view in establishment clause

questions.

10

Before I try to save two minutes, if the Court

11

please, I want to say that I repeat what I started with.

12

If we are wrong in our establishment clause position, if

13

the village may allow the creche, it does not follow that

14

it must and we think the Circuit has held that it must and

15

that it is wrong in that.

Thank you.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF MARVIN SCHWARTZ, ESQ.,

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

20
21

22

Mr. Schwartz?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the Court:
What the Second Circuit decided in this case was

23

that the only two grounds offered by the village for denial

24

of access to the creche were invalid.

25

which the village offered was the establishment clause.

The first ground

21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

The Second Circuit, I submit correctly, held that that

2

argument could not survive Lynch.

3

The second argument made by the village in the

4

Second Circuit and made explicitly in its brief was that

5

even if the establishment clause was not an adequate justi­

6

fication for denial of access, then the village could not

7

be required to post and to permit controversial devicive,

8

sectarian symbol.

9

The Second Circuit made no mention in its opinion

10

of that second ground and I respectfully submit that the

11

reason for that is that the ground is so devoid of con­

12

stitutional merit that it takes ingenuity and a facilty

13

and forensic skills such as only my friend possesses to

14

advance it.

15

It is significant, may it please the Court, that

16

the only effort to express a point of view which has been

17

denied by the Village of Scarsdale for its park, the only

18

effort to express which has been denied access is the

19

creche.

20

For more than 25 years every application to display

21

an unattended symbol in Scarsdale's parks has been granted

22

or the village Trustees have directed the use of a part

23

of the park system other than Boniface Circle.

24
25

QUESTION:

May I ask, Mr. Schwartz, your view?

If the village in response to the request had then adopted
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

a regulation saying no more unattended symbols in the park

2

and for that reason you may not show the creche, would that

3

have been permissible in your view?

4

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That would depend, sir, upon several

5

circumstances.

6

reasonable time, place and manner restrictions.

I agree that the village could impose

7

QUESTION:

8

given you a specific example.

9
10

Well, that is my restriction.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

QUESTION:

12

MR. SCHWARTZ:

QUESTION:
the question.

16
17

It is.
And, secondly, it would have to

justify a significant governmental interest.

14
15

But it would first of all have

to be content neutral.

11

13

Well, does it.

What could the village do if this

Court affirm?
QUESTION:

No.

I am just asking you under your

19

view of the law before we decide.

20

MR. SCHWARTZ:

22

You are just rephrasing

I am really interested in your answer.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

18

21

I have

I doubt very much, sir, that this

village could deny access to all of its parks for symbols
and signs of all kinds.

I find it difficult to perceive

23

a substantial governmental interest which would be so

24

served.

25

QUESTION:

Wouldn't there be something like a
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

governmental interest if the recital -- the preamble said

2

that in order to minimize vandalism with respect to

3

unattended symbols that no unattended symbols would be

4

allowed?

5

MR. SCHWARTZ:

In a village which has a history

6

for more than 25 years of freely permitted year after year

7

the banners of the Red Cross, a symbol of the Red Cross,

8

the banners of the American Field Service, the signs of

9

the United Fund, and when the village itself displays

10

Christmas lights and ornaments on its own lampposts,

11

village employees decorate Christmas trees in the lobby

12

of Village Hall, village employees ornament a living tree

13

in Boniface Circle where this creche sat for 24 years, it

14

seems difficult to me, though it is certainly conceivable,

15

and one would have to wait and see what justification the

16

village advanced, to determine if it advanced a significant

17

governmental interest.

18

But, standing here, may it please the Court, I

19

find it difficult to perceive a substantial governmental

20

interest which would be legitimately served by a total ban

21

of all unattended signs and symbols.

22

QUESTION:

Well, why can't the -- Supposing it

23

had pursued the kind of policy you say for the last 25 years

24

and it has resulted in having the creche up.

25

majority of the people in Scarsdale, let's say, are Jews

2

the parks used for any sort of symbols like that if they

3

have to put up a creche.

4

have a neutral policy that says at least in Boniface Circle

5

which is right in front of everybody, we are not going to

6

have anything.

7

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I don't see why they couldn't

Boniface Circle -- I believe the

8

village probably could say that there was a substantial

9

governmental interest to be served by banning all unattended

10

displays, but that isn't the issue in this case, Your Honor.

11
12
13

QUESTION:

I realize that isn't.

I don't think

that is what the village said.
MR. SCHWARTZ:

But, bear this in mind, Your Honor,

14

the village manager testified in this case by deposition

15

and his testimony is that in the 24 years the creche was

16

displayed at Boniface Circle there was never a complaint

17

that it was aesthetically displeasing, there was never a

18

complaint that it constituted visual clutter, never a

19

complaint that it interfered with traffic.

20

plaint ever made was that it was sectarian, divisive,

21

offensive, and unneighborly.

22

The only com­

It is difficult for me standing here to evaluate

23

whatever reason the village might advance when this Court

24

affirms for a new regulation.

25

reasonable in time, place and manner.

All I say is it must be
It must not be content

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

based or if it is content based, then there must be a

2

compelling governmental interest to support it and I can't

3

conceive of any.

4

QUESTION:

Why can't it say we just don't want

5

any content oriented messages in Boniface Park, it just

6

causes too much hassle, one side is yelling, the other side

7

is yelling?

8
9
10
11

We want to cut it out.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That may well be permissible but

it doesn't solve the issue in this case.

It doesn't solve

the issue in this case.
QUESTION:

Would you figure it would be consistent

12

with the Second Circuit's opinion and judgment if there

13

was an injunction entered on remand ordering the city to

14

allow this creche?

15
16

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I don't think the District Court

would enter such an order, Justice White.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Not under this?
I don't think so.

I think the

19

order would simply state that the village may not rely upon

20

the establishment clause or in its argument of divisiveness

21

or offensiveness.

22
23
24
25

QUESTION:

The Second Circuit has not mandated

that the creche be in the park?
MR. SCHWARTZ:

It has not passed upon regulations

which were not before it nor could it.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

The only reasons offered, as I said a moment ago,

2

were the establishment clause and offensiveness.

rejected those.

a regulation, someone will have to decide if it is a reason­

5

able regulation designed narrowly to support a substantial

6

governmental interest.

7

The Court

Now, if next year the village postulates

QUESTION:

May I ask, the statement that is quoted

8

at the end of your opponent's reply brief says that the

9

reason was it is inappropriate to use public property for

10

religious expression which is not necessarily saying it

11

woudl violate the establishment clause.

12

as a matter of community policy it is inappropriate.

13
14

Supposing they relied on that reason and no other,
what happens?

15
16

They just think

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I don't think the Constitution

would permit it, sir.

QUESTION:

That would not be a sufficient reason?

27
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that might be considered inappropriate to a large segment

2

of our community?

3

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I think that is impermissible,

4

Your Honor, for two reasons among others.

5

Amendment as this Court has construed it means anything,

is that inhibitions of expression may not be content based

absent a compelling governmental interest, so compelling

So your response to your opponent is

10

his horrible examples about the swastikas and all that,

11

those parade of horrors, yes, that is exactly what might

12

be done.

13

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Not necessarily.

I can conceive

14

of a content neutral, reasonable time, place and manner

Can it do that and yet deny access to Planned

I think not unless the First Amendment has

11

to be rewritten.

12

QUESTION:

Let me give

Let us assume that the Planned

So, your view is that this decision

13

means that Planned Parenthood has a right to put up the

14

kind of sign you describe in this park?

Can

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I would assume, Your Honor, no

16

matter what this Court decides in this case, no municipality

17

may inhibit speech on the basis of content unless it presents

18

a clear and present danger of disorder, unless it interferes

19

with other uses or unless, in the case of the explicit sexual

20

statuary which my friend envisions, it is unsuitable for

viewing by children.

difficulties of line drawing will not be obviated.

Yes, sir.

I don't see where the Red Cross has

ever said anything about Scarsdale.

MR. SCHWARTZ:

The banner --

Suppose it said we don't like the Jews

who live in Scarsdale.

20

MR. SCHWARTZ:

Unless that presented a clear and

present danger of breach of the peace which the Scarsdale

22

police were unable to deal with, I think there is a

23

constitutional right to put it up so long as other banners

are there.

which simply says the Red Cross or the Red Cross symbol

station in Scarsdale every March, the message which is intended

to convey is please give money to the Red Cross.

expression.

That is

What if Scarsdale said in Boniface

up a banner but we are not going to have anything else?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I think that is an unconstitutional

distinction.

Why?

21

we have opened is a place for signs supporting fund raising

MR. SCHWARTZ:

That, to me, is an expression of

24

a view and I think it is constitutionally impermissible

2

about a non-fund raising function.

3

the kind of distinction.

4

and this Court has held time and time again that only a

5

compelling, a compelling government interest can justify

6

a content-based exclusion from a public forum.

7

QUESTION:

I don't think that is

After all, it is content based

I take it from what you have said that

8

if only the creche as a symbol were allowed, but all other

9

faiths and religious symbols were prohibited that that would

10

not stand.

11

MR. SCHWARTZ:

12

Now, let me spend just a moment, if I may, on

13

the Perry case.

14

before the Court here.

15

I agree with that, Chief Justice.

That case has nothing to do with the issue

In the first place, the Court explicitly noted

16

that the mailboxes in the public school were not a public

17

forum.

18

of the viewpoint of the non-certified union, it was based

19

upon status.

20

Denial of access, the Court said, was not because

The most important thing, I think, for me to note

21

about the Perry case is the Court statement that a state

22

may use property for its intended purpose or restrict its

23

use so long as the regulation is reasonable and not an

24

effort to suppress expression merely because public officials

25

oppose the speaker's view.

That, may it please the Court,

access is denied and for no other reason that some

3

functionaries in the Village of Scarsdale find that the

4

view sought to be expressed is controversial, unpopular,

5

divisive and offensive.

6

Constitution does not permit.

What we have here is expression for which

I respectfully submit that the

7

On the establishment clause, if I may --

8

QUESTION:

9

Would you agree before you go on to

the establishment clause that there is at least theoretically

10

a basis for distinction between saying everything offensive

11

shall be banned and saying I will ban it because I disagree

12

with what you say?

13

MR. SCHWARTZ:

14

QUESTION:

There is a difference --

As I read the reason here, it wasn't

15

necessarily that they disagreed with the message of the

16

creche, they just thought this was an inappropriate use

17

of the religious symbol.

18

MR. SCHWARTZ:

I think the total effect of reading

19

the appendix is that it was rejected because some were

20

offended by its display, that it was not considered

21

neighborly to manifest a point of view which others did

22

not share or which made them uncomfortable, and that it

23

was thought to breach a wall which was thought erroneously

24

we now know to exist between church and state.

25

find that very much different than saying since I don't

constitutional difference.

QUESTION:

You don't think, for example, a Catholic

5

priest who would be clearly sympathetic with the message

could ever oppose having the creche in the village square?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

QUESTION:

Or is it just more specific?

MR. SCHWARTZ:

It is more specific, but the

11

significant thing to me is that it is in the context of

observance of a national holiday; that the holiday is

13

celebrated by people of all religious persuasions.

14

not only religious Christians who buy gifts and exchange

15

them and who exchange greetings of peace and goodwill, it

is our society as a whole.

Christmas has come to be a holiday with a wide-spread

this subject.
I think the Court should know that the turmoil

2
3

in Scarsdale which has grown begins in 1960, as the record

4

shows, and continues and accelerates and does not begin

5

with the lawsuit, the abortive lawsuit by the Civil Liberties

6

Union person.
I think in answer to a question put by Justice

7

8

Stevens, it should be said that this is not a case by any

9

means of viewpoint discrimination.

You just have to read

10

the somewhat anguished expressions of then Mayor Stone who

11

had once voted to allow the creche and came to realize its

12

significance standing there speaking for Scarsdale and

13

changed her vote, who is a Christian, who has a creche of

14

her own, to realize that this is not an anti-christian

15

expression.
You just have to read the statement of ten

16
17

Christian clergymen quoted at the end of our reply brief

18

against offending their non-christian neighbors, against

19

appropriating the public property for the practice of

20

religion, against mingling religion with the state, even

21

our own religion, to realize this is an effort to keep the

22

village free of the kind of division that has erupted and

23

is not in any sense a discrimination on the basis of view­

24

point .

25

I think with all the back and forth, the line
43

is clearly drawn and the potential significance for the

2

parks in the cities and villages of America ought to be

3

clean.

4

The first question is must they open those parks

5

to unattended structures, to swastikas, to creches, to

6

abortion controversies, or may they limit the parks as almost

7

all American parks have been limited to community symbols

8

that the people care about, restricting them in this fashion.
