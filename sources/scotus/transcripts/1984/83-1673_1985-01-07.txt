One of these statutory standards is the

at its decision.
Reversal also is in order if the employee may

7

8

demonstrate that the agency committed harmful error in

9

the application of a procedural rule set out in the

10

collective bargaining agreement.
The issue here is the application of this

11
12

harmful error rule to two federal employees who

13

undoubtedly engaged in sericus misconduct.

14

employed by the General Services Administration as

15

officers in the Federal Protective Service when their

16

employer received information that they had falsified

17

law enforcement records to cover up misbehavior and had

misused government property.

bargaining unit, elected to challenge this action by

25

filing a grievance through the negotiated procedure.

1

The case went to arbitration.

2

that —

The arbitrator found

3

QUESTION:

Excuse me, Mr.

Bothfeld.

4

Do most collective bargaining agreements in

5

the federal service have a grievance procedure that

6

concludes with arbitration?

7

8
9

MB. BOTHFELD:

Yes, they are required to

provide for arbitration.
QUESTION:

Do they have a standard form of

10

arbitration clause, or may they differ depending on how

11

the union and the agency negotiate?

12

KB. BOTHFELD:

They may differ. Your Honor.

13

In this case, the arbitrator found that the

14

employees had committed the acts alleged, and that those

15

acts fully justified the separation of the employees

16

from federal service.

17

The arbitrator also found that GSA had

18

misinterpreted its contract with the employees* union,

19

and that misinterpretation led it to commit two

20

procedural errors during the investigation into the

21

employees' misconduct.

22

The employees had not been informed that they

23

had a right to request the presence of a union

24

representative when they were interviewed by

25

investigating agents.

And the agency had delayed
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY. INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

unnecessarily before informing the employees that they

2

would be fired.
But the arbitrator concluded that these

3
4

procedural mistakes in no way prejudiced the grievance

5

case, did not affect the course of the agency's

6

investigation, and had no impact on the agency's

7

decision to fire the two employees.
Despite these findings, however,

8
9

the

arbitrator, in order to penalize the agency, ordered it

10

to reinstate the two employees in the Federal Protective

11

Service after they had served a two-week suspension.
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit

12
13

upheld

this decision.

The court accepted the

14

arbitrator's findings that the grievants had committed

15

the acts alleged and that those acts fully warranted

16

their being removed from federal employment.
The court also accented the arbitrator's

17
18

finding that the procedural mistakes had no effect cr.

19

the outcome of the case, and the court acknowledged that

20

the statutory harmful error rule controls arbitral

21

decisicns.

22

But the court went on to conclude that a union

23

may assert its own institutional interests during the

24

course of an individual employee’s adverse action

25

challenge, if that challenge is brought through a
6

negotiated grievance procedure.
As a result, the court found that an

2
3

arbitrator must set aside otherwise justified adverse

4

action

5

non-prejudicial procedural error if the arbitrator finds

6

that that error was in some undefined sense harmful to

7

the employee's union.

Could the government begin all over

again and remedy the defects seen by the court?
MR. ROTHFELD;

10

Your Honor.

It is not clear whether they

11

could,

Since the arbitrator and the Court

12

of Appeals imposed or took away the sanctions that had

13

been imposed by the agency to penalize the agency, it

14

might well be that the court would then find that the

15

agency would be circumventing its order if it attempted

16

to get around the penalty by reinstituting

17

procea dings.

18

So, it is not clear whether --

19

QUESTION;

On this holding of the Court of

20

Appeals, would it be correct to say that it wouldn’t

21

make any difference what the offenses of these employees

22

were?

23

MR. ROTHFELD;

24

QUESTION;

25

That is true. Your Honor.

It would be — they would be in the

same boat if they had been caught selling drugs, or

I think that is true.

The

focus —

4

QUESTION;

5

MR. ROTHFELD:

Purely a procedural problem.
The arbitrator focused solely

6

on the procedural mistakes that were made by the agency,

7

and in fact the actions of the employees in this case

8

were serious violations which the arbitrator noted cculd

9

be subjected to criminal penalties.
The case had been referred to the United

10
11

States Attorney, and he delayed taking action because he

12

believed that it could be settled through the agency

13

process.

14

affected by the arbitrator’s decision and the Court of

15

Appeals' affirmance in this case.

16

So, even violations cf law obviously are

QUESTION;

Mr. Sothfeld, what remedies dc you

17

propose for the union under your view cf the case tc

13

enforce the terms of the collective bargaining agreement

19

in this regard?

20
21

22

MR. ROTHFELD;

Well, there are two points to

make in response to that, Justice O'Connor.
First, most procedural violations will be

23

addressed during the course of an adverse action

24

challenge anyway, because any ccnseguential violation of

25

the collective bargaining agreement which had an effect

1

or might have affected the agency's decision will be

2

tak en into account and may lead to the overturning cf

3

advers e action.

4

In those cases in which procedural errors had

5

no eff ect on the agency’s d ecision, the Act gives unions

6

their own distinct remedial procedures that they can

7

use.

8

challe nging any violation o f the collective bargaining

9

agreem ent, and if it prevai Is, it might ask the

Any union can file a grievance of its own

10

arbitr ator to issue a cease and desist order to the

MR. ROTHFELDi

1

Well, the arbitrator certainly

2

can remedy in any way they find appropriate a violation

3

of --

4

QUESTION*

Well, including a — I thought I

5

heard you say earlier, including a cease and desist

6

order.

Against the agency?
MR. ROTHFELDi

7

I believe that would be an

8

appropriate remedy, if the arbitrator found that a

9

violation had occurred, and that that was a way to

10

redress the violation.
QUESTION;

11

Are cease and desist orders

12

something that private arbitrators can do,

13

thi nk ?
MR. ROTHFELDi

14

do you

Private arbitrators generally

15

direct the remedy to whatever violations have been

16

found,

17

the union is asserting its institutional interests,

18

as the statute clearly allows it to do for any violation

19

of the collective bargaining agreement.

20

and I think that — if this is an instance where

QUESTION;

and

Well, now, what about the past

21

misconduct, assuming the cease and desist order, whether

22

it is the Labor Board or the arbitrator?

23

about the past misconduct if it is the arbitrator who

24

wishes -- has the remedy of cease and desist?

25

MR. ROTHFELDi

What is dene

Well, past misconduct or past

(202) 628-9300

1

procedural violations that had no effect on the outcome

2

of the agency's decision, one thing the arbitrator

3

certainly cannot do is reinstate penalized employees.

4

The harmful error rule forecloses the arbitrator from

5

taking

6

that action.
So, to that sense, procedural violations won't

7

be addressed by the arbitrator except to the extent he

8

will prevent the agency from committing -- or direct the

9

agency not to commit further violations in the future.

10

I think,

Your Honor, the interpretation of the

11

harmful error rule that is provided by the Court cf

12

Appeals can only benefit one narrow class cf federal

13

employee under any reading cf the rule. An employee

14

whose adverse action was affected by procedural error

15

will have that action overturned.

16

And under any reading of the rule an employee

17

who brought his adverse action to the Merit Systems

18

Protection Board will have that action overturned only

19

if he can demonstrate that the procedural mistake had

20

some effect on the outcome of his case.

21

H|QUESTIONS

New, as I recall it, the

22

Congressional history here of this statute weighs

23

heavily in favor -- indicated Congress weighed heavily

24

in favor of arbitration, did it not?

25

MR. ROTHFELDi

It made provision for
11

(202) 628-9300

arbitration.

Yes, Your Honor.

QUESTIGNi

2

But there is much in the

3

legislative history that says that that is the preferred

4

course ?
MR. ROTHFELDi

5

Well, Congress recognized that

6

there are a variety of advantages to arbitration, and

7

certainly we don't dispute that.

8

and is often less expensive than litigation, and may

9

well be less acrimonious.

Arbitration is faster

But Congress did not make arbitration

10
11

preferred in the sense that it intended there would be

12

outcome determinative differences between arbitration

13

and appeals through the Merit Systems Protection Beard.

14

It was quite explicit on that, providing that they were

15

to be governed by the same standards and that — in

16

fact,

17

applied identically.

18

the legislative history said they should be

So, I don’t think arbitration was the

19

preferred method in the sense that it intended every

20

employee with a claim cf procedural error to go to

21

arbitration because he knew that he would win in

22

arbitration and might not win before the Merit Systems

23

Protection Board.

24
25

But that in fact is the only — the only
category of employees who are benefitted by the Court of

MR. ROTHFELD:

Or would it have had to file a

separate grievance of its own?
MR. ROTHFELD:

9

I think, Your Honor, that if it

10

had wanted to assert its institutional interests, it

11

would have been required to file a separate union

12

grievance, which the arbitrator might have consolidated.
QUESTION:

13

Well, if that is clear enough,

then

14

it was clearly out of bounds to give a remedy to the

15

union in this case.
MR. ROTHFELD:

16
17

I think that is correct,

Justice White.
QUESTION:

18

Is there something clear about that

in the

Act, or is there any — it is just clear because

the union is free to file a grievance of its own?

MR. ROTHFEID;

The union may independently

QUESTION:

No, no, but that is under the

collective bargaining agreement, isn’t it?

8

MR. ROTHFELD:

9

QUESTION:

Yes, that’s correct.

But hew about the route that the

10

non-union member may take before the -- what do you call

11

it, the agency or something?

12

MR. ROTHFELD;

Through the Merit Systems

QUESTION;

Yes.

Kay the union independently

MR. ROTHFELD;

QUESTION:

No, it may not.

In either —

Its only remedy is either tc gc

agreement, right, or go tc the Labor Relations Beard?

MR. ROTHFELD;

QUESTION:

22
23

Correct.

Those are the only two routes you

The employee is also given two routes.

2

But that isn't what the Federal

Circuit held, was it?
MR. ROTHFELD:

3

Well,

the Federal Circuit we

4

think incorrectly held that the union is a participant

5

or is an independent party to the employee's adverse

6

action charge through arbitration, and in fact, the

7

answer to your question is no.

8

QUESTION;

You just say that is plain wrong.

9

MR. ROTHFELD;

We do say that is plain wrcng,

10

not only because the union has its own independent

11

remedies, but because the adverse action procedures

12

place the focus on the employee.

13

net the union, which decides the forum for the

14

cha11ange.

15
16
17

QUESTION:

It is the employee,

And this remedy was imposed plainly

to benefit the union, not the employee.
MR. ROTHFELD;

Explicitly, Your Honor.

The

18

Court of Appeals opinion explicitly provided that it is

19

the union which is being benefitted.

20

In response to you, Justice Brennan, it is the

21

employee and net the union which chooses the forum,

Wasn't Congress focused on the

And if the employee — if the case goes to

10

arbitration and the arbitrator issues a decision adverse

11

to the employee's interest, it is only the employee who

12

can then appeal to the Federal Circuit.
The union has no independent right to appeal

13
14

on the employee’s behalf.

structure of the adverse action proceeding is focused on

the rights of the employee, not on the rights of the

Incidentally, do non-union members,

do they have — may they invoke the collective

12

While Congress certainly recognized that a

19

The Court of Appeals sidestepped all of these

considerations by asserting that the union's role as the

representative of the employee in an adverse action

challenge means that it can assert its own institutional

The Court of Appeals

apparently believed that the collective bargaining

vastly overstated.

In drafting the Act, Congress explicitly

balanced all cf these concerns and protected the

interests of unions by giving them their own set cf

The question is, does the arbitral award violate the

It is not disputed that if the award is net

The other employee, who was not directly

It is important to realize here the nature of

4

the di fferences between the arbitral context and the

5

Merit Systems Protection Board, and how Congress

6

specif ied in the statute arbitration and collective

7

bargai ning were to fit into the overall scheme.
Taking the latter first, in Title 7 of the

disput e that collective bargaining is of primary

11

import ance, and that the intent of the statute was tc

2

grievance procedures negotiated by the parties.

3

In view of the fact that the union is the one

4

who selects an arbitrator, in fact, invck.es, has the

5

authority whether or not to invoke arbitration, and the

6

union has the authority to negotiate the exclusion of

7

adverse actions from the arbitral process, the union

8

jointly with the agency selects the arbitrator, pays the

9

arbitrator, pays the costs of the arbitration, in view

10

of all of these circumstances expressed in the language

11

of the Act, the Courts of Appeals have found that the

12

union is an important party in the arbitral process, a

13

party whose significant interests are to be protected.

14

The government implies in their argument that

15

some kind of a per se rule is here involved, that any

16

kind of violation of a collective bargaining agreement

17

could cause an arbitrator to throw out this discipline

18

that has been imposed.

19

In a later case, Eevine versus Brisco,

the

20

Federal Circuit addressed this exact guestion, and held

21

that there must be a demonstration by the union of

22

prejudice to its rights, and the kind of demonstration

23

that the Court was talking about in Brisco was exactly

24

what occurred here, and they referred to this, the

In the face of Brisco, I think that this

argument of the government cannot really be given any

credence.

Is that it?

I would think, there would be a lot

MR. ROTHFELD;

9

I think that is true, Your

Honor.

At least the figures available from the GSA

indicate that many employees elect to go through

And to answer one of your questions, Chief

1

2

Justice Burger, there is no indication in the opinion of

3

the Court of Appeals or the arbitrator that the type of

4

crime or violation committed by the employees should

5

make any difference in the remedy that is provided,

6

because it is not the employee's situation which is

7

being considered by the arbitrator.
It is the violation of the union's

8
9

institutional rights.

And in either case, no matter

10

what the employee did, that violation presumably is the

I think two quick final points.

12

There

13

certainly is no reason to believe that arbitration will

14

be made meaningless in any sense if inconsequential

15

procedural errors cannot lead to the overturning of

16

adverse action action.

17

18

remedied before the board.

Any important violation

would be

In fact, coming to any other conclusion would

19

20

be entirely inconsistent with the Conoressional emphasis

21

on avoiding forum shopping.

22

forum shopping will occur if the arbitrators are

23

permitted to take into account the violations that the

24

board,

25

into account.

It seems undeniable that

by statute and by its regulations, cannot take

there are a variety of management rights that are not

negotiable with unions.

harmful error rule.
