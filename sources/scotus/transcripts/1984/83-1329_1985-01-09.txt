Yes, Your Honor.

That would be as opposed to what

The regulation does not require the beard to

Of course, in Wolff v. McDonnell and again in

Baxter v. Palmiciano, this Court rejected the notion

that due process requires such a statement cf reasons.

Why did he want the witnesses?

Well, Your Honor, that’ not clear

from the record as to why — why those witnesses were
requested.

In the record it reflects that, although Mr.

Real did not contest that he entered the office contrary

7

to the order of the correctional officer, that on

subsequent orders he was trying to leave, and that

MR. LEVIN;

Well, Your Honor, that may be a

good statement in mitigation, but in fact what occurred

here was the officer did issue an order which was not

under circumstances in which immediate obedience

But if he couldn't obey, in other

19

words, hasn't he asserted the defense that sounds rather

20

reasonable and he ought to have a chance to prove it?

21

ME. LEVIN;

Well, he -- I don't want to get

22

into the particulars of the record, but our position

23

basically is that under the circumstances, in fact, when

24

the officer had indeed ordered him not to come in in the

25

first place, and he did not comply with that order,
6

(202) 628-9300

1

although a number of other inmates whom he was with did,

2

was sufficient disobedience of an order, especially

3

under

4

circumstances such as these in which an assault

was taking place, to constitute the offenses charged.

QUESTION:

given

any of

Mr. Levin, there were no reasons

by the Disciplinary Board for its refusal to allow
the witnesses to be called?

8

MR. LEVIN;

9

QUESTION:

That’s correct, Your Honor.
And at the subsequent habeas

10

hearing in the State trial court, is it correct that the

11

State at that time offered no reason, no subsequent

12

reason or explanation?

13

MR. LEVIN:

Well, there was no evidence

14

presented by the State at that hearing.

15

our position that at that point, under the Constitution,

16

the judge had --

17

QUESTION;

Basically, it’s

Well, in addition to no evidence,

18

as I understand that, and I want you to rorrect me if

19

I'm wrong, the attorney for the State offered no

explanation at all.

21

22
23

MR. LEVIN;

That's correct, Your Honor.

There

was no explanation offered.
QUESTION;

So, on the surface then, the

24

Defendant may have had some plausible excuse for his

25

failure to immediately leave the scene, and yet the

2

3
4

Is that right?

Is that the posture in which

we review the case?

5

MR. LEVIN:

Well, Your Honor, the reviewing

6

court

did, I believe, have the administrative record

7

which

reflected what was before the Prison Disciplinary

8

Board during the prison disciplinary proceedings.

9

It's our position that, given the guidance of

10

wholly

11

the discretion of the board to properly deny witnesses,

12

based on the factors that are laid out in those

13

regulations, and the failure of Mr.

14

make any showing that the board failed to follow those

15

procedures,

16

the board to make that determination, and that in fact

17

at the hearing before the judge, there was no reason why

18

correctional authorities had to come forward at that

19

point with their reason.

QUESTION :
HR. LEVIN:

Yeah
Well, the reasons for the order,

the reasons for the charge of the offense in the first
place,

were before the court in the administrative

record and the disciplinary report.
QUESTION:

It said -- well, what was the

reason for the guard doing that?
MR. LEVIN;

The guard was in a prison office,

an off ice within the prison , trying to stop another
inmate's attack on another guard.

That's what the record

next door,

began to enter the office.

That's in the record.
That's in the administrative

That's in the disciplinary report.
QUESTION:

Well, that's all I was asking for.

QUESTION:

Counsel, what, in your view, would

the prisoner have to show to trigger some duty tc
respond at the habeas hearing in State court?
MR. LFVIN;

Well, Your Honor, in some of the

lower federal courts in successful actions under these
circumstances, what prisoners did show, for example, was
that there was a persistent practice on the part of
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

prison officials to never allow an inmate to call a

2

witnes s.

3
4

Certainly, if an inmate could make a prima
facie showing, for example, that the prison officials

5

were acting on a discriminatory basis with respect to

6

their decisions, that would be a showing that prison

7

officials were not properly exercising their

8

discre tion .

9

QUESTION!

Could a showing ever be made, in

10

your view, on an individual case that it was needed just

11

for evidence and there was no valid excuse no

12

discrimination alleged, no overall policy alleged?

13

ME. LEVIN;
*

Well, Your Honor, in the first

t

14

place, it's our position that the necessity with respect

15

to the evidence is not the end of the inquiry.

16

inquiry also has to go to, as this Court considered in

17

Wolff, to what kinds of risks would be involved

18

bringing that witness into the disciplinary hearing

room.

20

The

in

Second, with respect to your answer about the

21

individual case, certainly one can hypothesize

22

situations in which a prison inmate could make

23

allegations and prove through evidence that there was

24

some systematic discrimination against him or some plot

25

on the part of prison officials to set him up, and that

2

4

QUESTION:

Well, do you think that the case of

Hughes v. Roe has any relevance for our purposes here in
indicating that in the absence of some indication cn the

5

record that concern for safety of witnesses, for

6

example, or other prisoners was a concern that the State

7

has to offer at least an explanation of some kind?

8
9

?5R. LEVIN:

No, Your Honor.

I don't believe

Hughes v. Roe is applicable in this case or provides

10

much guidance.

11

alleged that he was placed into segregation without any

12

prior hearing whatsoever, and this Court held that that

13

was sufficient to survive a Pule 12(b)(6) motion to

14

dismis s.

15

In Hughes, of course, an inmate had

Under subsequent case law, Helms v. Hewitt,

16

decided by this case, it was made plain that under those

17

circumstances, a liberty interest might be implicated

18

and an

19

of a scenario is much — the scenario where an inmate

20

may not have a hearing where liberty interest is

21

implioated, may not have a hearing at all,

22

quite distinct from the situation such as this where

23

there is no question that hr. Real received his

24

hearin g.

25

inmate might be entitled to a hearing.

That kind

we submit is

There is no indication that the Prison

Disciplinary Board failed to follow what, on their face/

2

were fully adequate procedures, and where this Court has

3

indeed

4
5

/

held that the prisoner doesn't have the right to

have a statement of reasons, which is exactly the right
that the Supreme Judicial Court held that he did have.

6

QUESTION;

Well, of course,

the Supreme

7

Judicial Court seems to have held that, and I think

8

that's contrary to the — for myself, that's contrary to

9

the language in Wolff and in Baxter.

But it seems to me

10

the State is going further here, and they are saying not

11

only do we not have to supply written reasons in the

12

administrative record at the time the hearing is

13

conducted before the Superintendent, but if the

14

disciplinary hearing is later challenged for revocation

15

of good time on a violation of the constitutional rights

16

of the prisoner, even in court we don’t have to advance

17

any reason why the Superintendent didn't allow these

18

witnesses to be called.

19

And I think you run into a little trouble ith

20

some of the language in Wolff there.

21

don't have to give reasons means you don't have to give

22

reasons, as I read Wolff, at the time of the

23

disciplinary hearings, not that you cannot be judicially

24

called

25

I mean to say you

upon later to give reasons in a particular case.
MR. LEVINi

No, Your Honor.

We don't contest

13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that in the individual case, in a later judicial

2

proceeding to review the action of prison officials,

3

that where the prisoner makes cut a prima facie case
i

4 i
i
i

5i
6
7

that he's been denied his procedural rights, that prison
officials are going to have to answer that case as they
would in any ether habeas corpus case or a 1983 case.
Cur position is merely that where a prisoner

8

simply goes into court and says I didn't get a witness,

9

under this court's ruling in Wclff that's net enough

10

because, especially under these circum stances in

11

Massachusetts where the procedures which prison

12

officials follow are exactly those procedures prescribed

13

in Wolff, the Prison Disciplinary Board has that very

14

discretion to say you can request the witness but we can

15
16

i

deny it, and we don't have to tell you why.
So that it seems anomalous,

just as a matter

17

of pleading, to have a prisoner go into court and say,

18

well, it did exactly what they're entitled to do under

1S

the Constitution and under their regulations, but I want

20

to know more, I want them to answer me more; I want tnem

21

to justify themselves.

22

That, it seems to me, would be fairly

23

unprecedented just by virtue of general rules of

24

pleading, and —

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

You may continue, Mr.

Levin.
MR. LEVIN;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

6

may it please the Court, to resume with my response to

7

Justice White's question, in fact what the Supreme

8

Judicial Court did hold in this case is that the

9

statement of reasons to be given is to be given in the

10
11

administrative record at the disciplinary hearing.
Now, this Court has recently stated in Olim v.

12

Wakinakona that procedures do not exist in a vacuum.

13

They are not to be valued in and of themselves, but they

14

exist for a purpose, and that is to protect some

15

substantive right* in this case, it's the inmate's

16

substantive right or substantive liberty interest in

17

statutory good time.

18

Furthermore, this Court has noted that in

19

fashioning its procedural prescriptions, prescriptions

20

required by the Constitution, it is concerned that

21

government officials be guided by adequate procedures in

22

the generality of cases, and net with whether, when

23

guided by such

24

with which a court might later disagree.

25

procedures, officials make a decision

In this case, the procedure prescribed by the
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Supreme Judicial Court does not really bear any relation
to these principles.

The procedural requirement of a

statement of reasons is primarily focused on
safeguarding, if you will, another procedural
requirement; that is, the requirement cf the right to
call witnesses, that qualified right that this Court
enunciated in Wolff v. McDonnell.
Furthermore, and equally as important, the
impetus of the Supreme Judicial Court’s decision was
that it wanted a record that it could review basically
on a case-by-case basis to decide whether or not it
agreed

with what prison officials were doing.

3

One, in dealing with these cases, we wish to

4

stress, as Judge Friendly said in his article, seme kind

5

of hearing that we’re dealing with a system of mass

6

justice, and that prison officials in Massachusetts, for

7

example, in

8

proceedings at which prisoners were entitled to the full

9

procedural safeguards, presumably as you suggested,

1980 had almost 7,000 disciplinary

10

which would include an extended record, although that

11

record would be confidential.

12

Now, this may not seem like much in the

13

context of any one disciplinary proceeding, but when you

15

talking about resources that come out of other areas

During the disciplinary action involved in

21

this case, hr. Real was in the state prison on a three t

22

23

shotgun.

24

Correction issued a certificate of discharge from that

25

sentence and he made the discharge effective to July 19,

credi t .
From that date, from the July 19th date, Kr.
Real was deemed to have begun serving a five-year from
and after sentence imposed for a manslaughter offense he
committed while in prison, killing another inmate.
Mow, the Respondent has suggested that this
case is now moot because Kr. Real has received the
certificate of discharge from the three to five-year
sentence, that is,

the sentence to which the good time

at issue would apply.
But that’s clearly not the case, because if
this Court were to affirm the judgment of the Supreme
Judicial Court, returning the 150 days good time to Kr.
Real,

his effective date of discharge then becomes seme

time in February 1982.

The running of his five-year

from and after sentence is from that date, and Kr. Real
ceases to be in Massachusetts custody in February of
1987,

rather than in July of 1987.
Kr. Real clearly has a concrete interest in

this case which presents the Court with a justiciable
con tro versy.
If I might, if there are no further questions,
I’d like to reserve my remaining time.

It was at this point that Mr. Peal, while

16

leaving, was stopped, according to his testimony at the

17

hearing, was stopped by another officer who shook him

18

down and delayed him from complying with the order that

19

had been given to him.

20

The inmates which John Peal requested be

21

called in his defense were eye witnesses who would have

22

corroborated his version of what happened, and

23

therefore, in our view, would have given him a defense

24

to the charge that he had disobeyed an officer and also

25

the charges, in addition, that he had incited to riot

-

So we see there are two issues in the case;

21

one, whether or not due process is violated by the

22

arbitrary denial by the prison officials of the

23

witnesses on the facts of this case; and the second

24

broader issue, which is the issue as to whether due

25

process requires that the administrative record of a

And we think they are both separate, yet both

The second, broader one, we think is

unnecessary to be decided by this Court, because I think

the portion of the opinion referred to by Justice

Stevens on page 15, where the court in defining the

22

issue presented, indicates that the question is whether

23

federal due process requirements impose a duty on the

Board to explain in any fashion at the hearing or later,

25

why witnesses were not allowed to testify.

However, we think that the Respondent iray defend the

unnecessary for this Court to decide that issue.

proceeding, at which point when the inmate has made that
/
priraa facie case, the prison officials would have some
burden to justify the denial of witnesses.
In this case, we think that a primar facie

5

case was made, and it is difficult to see what more an

6

inmate could be required to do than to make a timely

7

request for relevant witnesses who could testify and in

8

this case provide a basis for a self defense claim.

9

The Petitioner's argument that there is a

10

greater burden defies common sense, and it also would

11

make that burden impossible to be met by the inmate.

12

It's difficult to see how the inmate could disprove the

13

reasons that the prison officials may have for not

14

calling a witness if the inmate can't even find out what

15

those reasons are.

16

The Petitioner argues that somehow the inmate

17

has a greater burden to go beyond making a showing of

18

relevance to his or her case, and to in fact disprove

19

any possible reasons the Commonwealth might have for not

20

calling the witnesses.

21

QUESTION;

Kr. Shapiro, what about Justice

22

O'Connor's suggestion made to your opponent, that

perhaps there should be reasons at least adduced in the

of the very volatility of the prison situation?

2

MR.-SHAPIRO:

We think that where the

3

Commonwealth makes a showing that that is a

4

consideration in the case,

5

Indeed, it would be appropriate, turning for a moment to

6

the question of requiring some statement of reason or

7

other basis to appear in the administrative record for a

8

similar requirement, and we have referred in our brief

9

to the regulations of the Federal Bureau of Prisons

10

that would be appropriate.

which provides just for such a possibility.

11

And in a case where the Disciplinary Board

12

concludes that documenting the reliability of an

13

informant upon which it has relied in a decision would

14

pose a

15

endangering that informant, the Disciplinary Board of

16

the chairperson of the Disciplinary Board may document

17

those reasons, but not provide them to the inmate*, that

18

is, to keep them apart from the inmate for the very

19

purpose of a subsequent justification in court, at which

20

time the reasons could be examined or the statement

21

could be examined in camera.

22

threat to identifying that informant or otherwise

So that the only serious claim that the

23

Commonwealth has made here that a statement of reasons

24

would

25

of an informant, there is a perfectly reasonable

interfere with security or endanger the identify

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

alternative which could be utilized so that those
reasons would not prejudice the particular informant
in vclv ed.
The other argument that Petitioner makes to
justify the prison officials in not having to make any
showing, either at the administrative hearing or
otherwise, is that an inmate's right to present
witnesses is not violated unless there is a pattern or
practice or a discrimination by the Disciplinary Poard
or the prison officials which go beyond the individual
case.
We think in Wolff v.

McDonnell, this Court

clearly stated that a witness has — an inmate has a
right to call witnesses unless the witnesses would be
irrelevant, cumulative, unnecessary, or pose a threat to
institutional security in some other way.
The argument that somehow the inmate could be
denied
overt

witnesses arbitrarily, so long as there was no
discrimination or pattern in practice, is simply

inconsistent with Wolff, and is unrelated to the reasons
for according an inmate that right to call witnesses,
which is to give that individual an opportunity to have
a fair hearing on the charges against that particular
inmate .
And why, in order to establish that that right

there is some pattern in practice, escapes me, and I

3

The Commonwealth's argument would also carry

6

the principle of deference to the expert judgment cf

7

prison officials too far.

9

presumed to have made a decision to deny witnesses in

What the Commonwealth, in

10

accordance with applicable regulations, and that any

11

inquiry into the basis for that refusal is unwarranted.

12

It's one thing to defer where prison officials

to the presumption that they have exercised a judgment

We do think that Hughes v. Roe is or should be

10

despositive of the case, because in Hughes the inmate

11

was held to have made a prima facie showing that he was

12

entitled to a hearing.

13

the present case, made no response, made no showing as

14

to any legitimate basis in adminstraticn for

correctional goals for denying that hearing, and this

Then, that inmate should be

1

With respect to the decision of the court

2

below on the issue of whether or not due process

3

requires that the administrative record of a

4

disciplinary hearing have some support for the decision

5

to deny witnesses, I'd like to emphasize first that that

6

decision is not inconsistent with Wolff.

7

In Wolff, this Court stated that an inmate has

8

a right to call witnesses, which may be denied if there

9

are certain legitimate considerations involved.

The

10

Court went on to say that although it would be useful

11

for the Board to give an explanation of its reasons and

12

make a written statement of those reasons in the record ,

13

at that time the Court deemed it unnecessary to require

14

thar.

15

The Supreme Judicial Court's decision, first

16

of all,'does not require a written statement of reason.

17

What it does require is that there be some support in

18

the administrative record.

19

more flexible requirement than a written statement of

20

reasons.

21

That requirement is a far

That requirement can be satisfied by reviewing

22

the record to determine whether the record itself

23

supports a decision to deny witnesses; for example, if

24

the request of the inmate himself or herself indicates

25

that the witnesses would not be relevant tc the
43

proceeding.

2

For example, the charge may be such that it's

3

clear that no witnesses could appropriately testify in

4

the case.

5

The Board, at a later review in court, could

6

rely upon that information which is obvious from a

7

review of the record itself to deny.

8

QUESTIONi

That would be pretty coincidental,

9

though, wouldn't it, when the record happened to support

else,

to call the witness.

the refusal of the — or due to the record,

MR. SHAPIROi

I don't think it would be

16

the cases, many cases, reviewing the record of an

adminstrative hearing will indicate what the issues were

18

in the case, why the witnesses were called, and why they

19

were denied.

20

I think that in, if not the majority of

So that although

there may be cases where a

21

statement of reasons or some explanation by the Board is

required, we think that there are many other cases where

the record itself will, upon review, provide an adequate

basis for a decision by the Board.

this case?
MR. SHAPIRO:

The written record of the

4

hearing consists of the disciplinary charge, and these

5

are set forth in the Appendix to this case, the

6

disciplinary report which is on page 13-A of the

7

Appendix, the report of the testimony and who testified

8

on 14-A, the decision cf the Beard on 15-A, the appeal

9

and che decision of the Superintendent affirming the

10
11

conviction of the inmate.
QUESTION:

So at least the administrative

12

report, as it's now done in Massachusetts, doesn't have

13

a transcript of testimony.

14

MR. SHAPIRO:

15

QUESTION:

There is no transcript.

Well, how could a

report of the

dimensions of,

17

sheerest coincidence, support a conclusion that

witnesses shouldn't be allowed?
