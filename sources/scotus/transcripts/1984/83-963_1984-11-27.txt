This is an appeal from a decision of the Rhode

The issue before you today is

10

whether the exclusionary rule should be applied to

Tiverton police entered the Attic Lounge pursuant to a

receiving a tip from a neighboring police department

that they wculd find stolen prcperty on the property of
