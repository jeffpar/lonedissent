DENNIS MUCHNICKI, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

Kcvacs.

We'll hear arguments

ME. MUCHNICKI:

Thank you, ur. Chief Justice,

8

may it please the Court, this matter is before the Court

9

pursuant to a petition filed by the people of the State

10

of Ohio, seeking a writ of certiorari to the United

11

States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

12

The people of Ohio seek reversal of the

13

determination that a bankruptcy court may discharge the

14

duty of a debtor to comply with the state court

15

injunction to abate a public health hazard by cleaning

16

up a hazardous waste -- a toxic waste facility.

17
18
19

In this argument, Ohio wishes to make three
basic points.
First, as a matter of public policy, the

20

decision below treats the goals of the bankruptcy system

21

as absolute values which transcend virtually every ether

22

matter of public policy, including the protection of

23

public health and safety.

24
25

Secondly,

as to the factual context of this

case, Ohio is not before this Court seeking compensation

for past harm or expenses, but rather we are attempting

2

to prevent future harm by obtaining compliance with an

3

injunction to abate an ongoing nuisance and health

4

h azard.

QUESTION;.

It's been abated now, hasn’t it?

6

MR. N UCHNICKIi

7

The drums — the drums that were -- the

No, it has not, Your Honor.

8

materials that were in the drums or that remain in the

9

drums have been removed, but the most serious problem

10

that still exists is the pollution of the ground water

11

which is used by the City of Hamilton for its water

12

supply .

13

And right now, as a result of the past

14

practices on that site, the soils of the site are so

15

thoroughly saturated with toxic wastes that they are now

16

an ongoina source of pollution, that every day more

17

pollution is leaching into the ground water and you have

18

a continuing violation.

But the receiver, under the state court order, has

QUESTION;

But Kovacs couldn't literally carry

cut the terms of the injunction.

He couldn't enter the

premises and take charge of it and carry out acts that

11

he thought were justified.

Because the State dispossessed him

of the property by putting a receiver in charge.
MR. MUCHNICKI;

They created — they put the

receiver in equitable possession of the property.
QUESTION;

Well,

I know, but he's the one that

20

sooner or later took some steps, but then the United

21

States took seme steps and removed the toxic wastes from

22

the surface.

23

Is that right?

MR. MUCHNICKI;

Maybe they should get it for that,

but isn’t that what they want from him?
MR. MUCHNICKI:

require the expenditure of money.

2

Yes.

Well, the receiver

joined in the original motion to have the state court

hold a hearing to determine the extent of Mr. Kovacs's

further obligations.

That was the hearing which the

Where is that injunction?

Is that

Yes, it is.

stating Mr. Kovacs is to continue to cooperate with the

MR. MUCHNICKI;

The record would show that he

has not cooperated in coming back to the state court the

way the receiver wanted him to, to further define his

or in

Now,

1

the Third Circuit, in the recent Penn

2

Terra case, recognizes that on its face, the bankruptcy

3

code recognizes that there are other policies which at

4

times are to prevail -- one of which, specifically

5

referenced, is protection of the environment.

6

In the automatic statutory stay provisions,

7

Congress said we did not want to interfere with the

8

states and their police power enforcement activities; in

9

the removal provisions, so that you cannot remove an

10

enforcement action to the bankruptcy courts in 28 USC

11

959E,

12

to operate in compliance with state law.

there is a specific provision requiring trustees

13

In the legislative history of section 105

14

dealing with discretionary stays, there is specific

15

reference to the fact that any discretionary injunction

16

must protect the legitimate interest of the state in its

17

law enforcement.

18

Thus, in Penn Terra, they recognized that the

19

bankruptcy code is one title of the United States Cede;

20

it does not overrule everything else.

21

Similarly, the court below did not recognize

22

the repeated holdings of this Court which have held that

23

there will not be a preemptive effect created --

24

preemption of state regulation, absent clear and

25

expressed congressional language.

And in the bankrupt

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Muchnicki, when you're talking

3

here,

4

of a claim in bankruptcy, aren't you?

you're talking basically about the dischargability

MR. MUCHNICKI:

5

We are talking about whether

6

the duty to comply with the injunction is a claim in

7

bankru ptcy.

8

QUESTION:

9

MR. MUCHNICKIs
QUESTION:

10

And therefore can be discharged.
Correct.

Well, certainly,

the first place

11

you'd lock for that is the bankruptcy court. I mean the

12

thing comes up under the bankruptcy statute, not under

13

any other statute.

14

MR. MUCHNICKIs

15

But in determining whether the — after you

16

look at the code and you see the definition of claim,

17

one then has to say is this obligation a claim.

18

what is the effect of that interpretation, particularly

19

when there’s no indication anywhere in either the

20

language of the code or in the legislative history that

21

injunctions to abate nuisances were to be construed as a

22

claim.

23

QUESTION:

That is correct,

Your Honor.

And

But if you say it's not a claim,

24

then presumably Ohio is not entitled to share with other

25

general creditors in the bankrupt's estate.
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

result here?

7

MR. MUCHNICKI;

Yes, we do, to a certain --

8

here's — yes,, we do, because it may wind up that, in

9

fact,

we do wind up sharing in the estate, in that the

10

estate has to be used to comply with the law.

11

not a -- we do not have a claim that we fit within the

12

priori ties.

13

We are

Now, for past expenditures -- for example, if

14

we were able to do the cleanup and had a bill, that till

problems, that is not a claim.

17

But in terms of having ongoing

QUESTION;

Under law, could the State move in

18

and undertake this and then, a little bit late, seek to

19

get reimbursement?

20

MR. MUCHNICKI;

It is unclear on that.

I

21

think Ohio law provides for a lien on the property,

22

that's all.

23

QUESTION;

For what?

24

MR. MUCHNICKI;

25

QUESTION;

A lien on the property.

Just a lien, not some positive

action ?

2

MR. aUCHNICKI;

3

QUESTION;

Bight.

Now --

Normally, in most states, if there

4

is a fire, for example, and a building is imposing a

5

hazard after the fire is over, falling debris and

6

collapsing walls, there is inherent authority in the

7

local governments to go in and take care of it if the

8

owners don't.

9

Now, isn't there something like that in Ohio?
MR. MUCHNICKIs

10
11

lien on the property.
QUESTION;

12

Yes, and what you get is a

Now -Well, a lien isn't going to take

13

care of the toxic wastes.

14

authority to go in and do this?
MR. MUCHNICKI:

15

Are you saying Chic has nc

I think it is not a question

16

of authority, Your Honor; it is a question of ability.

17

We don't have the ability to do it.
QUESTION;

18

Well, you can hire people to do

19

it.

20

down of a partially burned building, but they hire

21

somebody to do it if the owner doesn’t do it.

22

The city council doesn't go out and tear the walls

MR. MUCHNICKIs

The fact of the matter is, if

23

you look at the situation, I'll give you an example of

24

what Ohio is facing with leached toxic waste sites.

25

We have 28 sites right now on the national

We have 800 more that we are still

Well/ doesn’t your answer to the

6

Chief Justice's question suggest that Ohio is not

7

prevented by anything except lack of money from clear.ig

8

up this site, and what you're really concerned about

9

here is money.
NE. MUCKNICKI:

10

Well, yes, money will be

11

required to take up the site.

12

about is how Congress treated this, and what did

13

Congress decide in terms of the definition of claim?

But what we are concerned

14

And I think when you look at' that language,

15

the claim is to find, in terms of equitable remedies,

16

and whether we can compel the debtor to perform the

17

injunction,

18

says "an equitable remedy for breach of performance, if

19

the breach gives rise from an alternative right to

20

payment.”

21

the definition of claim for equitable remedy

Now, to begin with, the breach of performance

22

is a contractual phrase.

It does not refer to

23

violations of law.

24

difference between a contractual situation where two

25

people voluntarily agree to do something, in this

Indeed, when you think about the

17

(202) 628-9300

1

situation where the public has not agreed to have Mr.

2

Kovacs impose his obligations on the people of Hamilton,

MR. MUCHNICKIi

Well, Your Honor, let me give

you an example of what we encountered previously in the
bankruptcy court.

The first time we appeared -- when we

filed the mere motion requesting — for the hearing to
determine what his current status was,

and then the

debtor moved fo-r imposition of the stay, the bankruptcy
judge — his first question was why he should not hold
me in contempt.

And I didn't feel I had done anything

other than ask for a hearing, an informational hearing.
And the bankruptcy judge made it quite clear
that he construed this to be very broad, and therefore I
tend to think that if I were to file a motion to held
Mr. Kovacs in contempt, that would be viewed as an
attempt to compel him to pay and the bankruptcy court
would find me -QUESTION;

Well, I guess we don’t know that.

At least the Sixth Circuit in its opinion said that if
Ohio had elected to have a money penalty assessed
against Kovacs for the environmental damage he caused,
we would have faced a different question, and that would
not have been subject to the automatic stay.
MR. KUCHNICKIs
that.

The Sixth Circuit did say

But even if we go into that penalty, it does not

accomplish the cleanup which is necessary to protect the
public, and I think that is our primary concern here.

22

there is really only one point in time which is

MR. CALDWELL:

12

I think it's a necessary

characteristic, if you're talking about an obligation

here that involves the expenditure of millions of

The State has ignored the fact that throughout

the State settled for here was the surface cleanup.

what they found out was that maybe they didn’t make such

that nobody addressed that question.

Well, since the adoption of the

This site began, really,

QUESTION:

7

where you are enjoined from maintaining your wall cr

The cost of

6

QUESTION:.

Well,

I'm asking you whether y c ur

7

position is whether, ordinarily, equitable obligat ions

8

like this are dischargable?
MR. CALDWELL:

9

You can certainly make an

10

argument that they are dischargable.

11

history which has been quoted in here, more in the

12

State's brief and curs, tends tc indicate that wha t

13

Congress was concerned about was the dischargabili ty of

going to run into millions or hundreds cf millions.

20

MR. CALDWELL:

21

QUESTION:

No question.

Then, isn't the question of

dischargability in bankruptcy really academic, unless

But if the judgment,

Now,

there is one —

And that's the result of the

opinions below.
MR. CALDWELL;

Yes.

One point that was raised

in the State's reply brief that we, of course, couldn't

address, and that was the suggestion that if this case

2

is affirmed, this property will revert to Mr. Kovacs's

3

possession, and he'll be free to go back in business.

4

Well, that, of course, is absurd.

The State

5

court receiver has the power of sale, and presumably he

6

will sell the property to satisfy whatever remaining

7

financial obligations there are.
QUESTION:

8

Didn't the bankruptcy court take

f

9

charge of the property in the hands of the receiver?

10

MR. CALDWELL:

11

QUESTION*

12

No, they did not.

So Kovacs's property was never

committed to paying his bills?
MR. CALDWELL*

13

Well, you have to remember, you

14

have a piece of property, the toxic nature of it being

notorious all over the Midwest; do you really think that

Not formally, but he wouldn't

A trustee was appointed.

MR. CALDWELL:

HR. CALDWELL;

No, I don't think so.

May I ask a followup to a question

6

a claim within the meaning cf the bankruptcy statute,

then does that mean that the State is a general creditor

MR. CALDWELL;

MR. MUCHNICKI:

QUESTION;

Or to the trustee in bankruptcy.

12

MR. MUCHNICKI;

Well, here is the status of

13

the property.

The property — the Chem-Dyne is owned by

14

Hierco Realty, which is a partnership; it was part cf

15

the bankruptcy.

16

Kovacs and the Chem-Dyne Ccrporation which is net in the

ME.. MUCHNICKI;

I think on that suggestion,

that would certainly show where it is.

3

Also, as to whether there was a turnover

4

action, in fact, the bankruptcy trustee did file a

5

turnover action —

6

QUESTION:

What happened?

7

MR. MUCHNICKI:

— against the receiver, and

8

the receiver had to turn over the most important thing,

being like the tank trucks and the pumps and the things

that he was using to do the cleanup.

Well, I was simply responding

to the factual question that was raised.

20

previously given that the property would revert, and I

21

just couldn't see — understand that.

22

ME. MUCHNICKI;

That's all.

Well, it would be my

understanding, what the receiver apparently intends to

do is to file a motion to dissolve it, and at that pcint

the property will go back to Mr. Kovacs.
