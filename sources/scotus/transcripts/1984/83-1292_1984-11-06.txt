QUESTION;

Wouldn’t it be fair tc say that

2

most of the people who fail to register are opponents of

3

the registration process?

4

MR. ROSENBAUM;

Chief Justice Burger/ there

5

were hearings before a Congressional Committee as tc the

6

causes of individuals who did not register.

hearings before a Senate Subcommittee elicited a variety

of reasons,

persons were upset that their peers
Six separate reasons were

Political and moral objection was only one cf

Sc, it was net mere statistical happenstance

17

that the only individuals in fact prosecuted were

18

political or religious objectors.

19

the government’s policy, the Justice Department

20

recognized that investigating and prosecuting only those

21

who proclaimed their ncncompliance would result in a

22

skewed sample of non registrants, what the government

23

itself termed a not typical sample.

24

recognized --

25

QUESTION;

From the inception of

The department

What does that term mean in the

(202) 628-9300

1

sense cf skewed or non-typical?

2
3
4

MR. ROSENBAUM:

It meant that out of an entire

peel of nonregistrants, individuals whe had a variety of
reasons for not registering, the only individuals who in

5

fact would be selected, would be singled out, would be

6

these whe had actively protested, either by writing the

7

President of the United States or by speaking out

8

against the draft itself.

9

QUESTION:

But you are going to single out by

10

some method, have some system for prosecution, sc in

11

that sense any system is "skewed" in your terms, isn't

12

it?

13

MR. ROSENEAUM:

Any system singles out certain

14

individuals for in ve s tiga ti cr. and prosecution.

15

critical issue in this case is whether the government

16

can rely upon a policy which is activated only through

17

the exercise of political petition or speech.

18
19

QUESTION^

May I ask, of the total pool I

think you mentioned 500,000 or 600,000.

20

MR. ROSENBAUM:

21

QUESTION:

Yes, sir.

Hew many cf those have been

22

identified by the government as nonregistrants at the

23

time the 15 suits were filed?

24
25

MR. R0SENEAUM:

That is an interesting

question that goes to the nature cf the government's

enforcement policy.

2

seme 500 or 60C individuals had been identified by the

3

government's policy, but that wasn’t because the

4

government had sought a variety of methods to identify

5

individuals, and happene only as a matter of chance to

6

elect to find the individuals who had spoken out or who

7

had written the President.

8

9

In fact, only in the neighborhood of

The very premise cf the government's
enforcement policy was that it was not interested,

that

10

it showed no concern whatsoever for nonregistrants who

11

had violated the law in any other way.

12

law that the government was enforcing was a law that

13

made it a crime to not register when accompanied by

14

protest cr speech,

15

It was as if the

net the offense itself.

QUESTIONS

Is my recollection incorrect that

16

the government had explored various ways cf ascertaining

17

the identity of a much larger number of a pool?

18
19

MR. FOSENrAUMs

Let me answer that in two

respects, Justice —

20

QUESTIONS

21

MR. ROSENBAUMs

Is that true?
It is not true that the

22

government at the time that these individuals had been

23

prosecuted had in fact made a determination to

24

investigate or prosecute by any other system than the

25

passive enforcement system.
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

For First Amendment purposes, whether in fact

2

they had intended another enforcement policy is

3

irrelevant.

4

The cases from this Court from the very

beginning of analysis of the First Amendment have

5

consistently held that a First Amendment violation

6

exists by virtue of whether or not there is an impact on

7

the First Amendment.

8
9

That the government might have had good
intentions, might some day have wanted to investigate

10

other individuals has no bearing as to whether or net a

11

First Amendment offense had in fact been committed.

12

But the fact of the case is, as the District

13

Court found, and. it was not reversed by the Ninth

14

Circuit, that the government itself had not pursued

15

available alternative methods, that in February of 1982,

16

the government in a volume called Increasing Selective

17

Service Compliance, had examined other alternatives

18

besides the passive enforcement system, had found them

19

viable, reasonable.

20

concerned about were political costs.

21

The only costs it had teen

In March of 1982, eight months after the

22

government states to this Court that it was interested

23

in another policy, a memo was drafted from the Assistant

24

Attorney General of the Criminal Eivisicn to his

25

counterpart in the Selective Service Department which

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

said, the purpose of this memo is to explore whether or

2

not we

3

4

shall address, whether cr not we shall establish

That is at Page 294 cf the memo.

And when I

5

questioned David Klein, the Justice Department official

6

who had authored that memo, I said to Hr. Klein,

7

you write it in Harch,

8

that the government was intent upon a system?

9

And Hr. Klein’s response,

why did

'82, eight months after you say

at 798 and at 8C2 cf

.10

the record, was that he wanted to push the

11

decisionmakers, he wanted tc push Selective Service to

12

the maximum extent possible to establish an active

13

enforcement system.

14

QUESTION;

15
16

Hr. Rosenbaum, what was the

occasion for your questioning Hr. Klein?
MR. F.OSENEAUM;

It was in the course of a

17

hearing before the District Court on the question cf the

18

propriety of the prosecution system which the government

19

had employed.

2

individuals had been singled out by virtue of their

3

expression of political rights.

4

QUESTION:

Mr. Rosenbaum, it sounded to me in

5

looking at the record as though in the court below you

6

had proceeded on a selective prosecution theory, and

7

that up in this Court now you are approaching the

8

prcbleir iruch as you would in attacking a statute which

9

on its face burdens First Amendment rights.

10
11

Have you changed your theory and your
conten tions 1

argument that there was intentional discrimination,

that the Ninth Circuit was incorrect in reversing.

that intent present.

2

All the Ninth Circuit said was, there are

3

other justificatiors that exist, stated that the clearly

4

erroneous standard ought to be applied, but never

5

indicated why upon an analysis of the clearly erroneous

6

standard somehow intent would net be there.

7

But it is actually the government that has

8

shifted its argument in this Ccurt.

9

Circuit level and at the District Court level, it was

At the Ninth

10

conceded by the government that what was implicated in

11

this case were First Amendment rights, and it is only

12

the government for the first time arguing before this

13

Court that First Amendment rights are not involved ir

14

this case.

15
16

And of course the nature of the policy itself
is one that the government has recognized.

17

MR. ROSENBAUM:

Nc, Justice C 'Conner, the

15

govern irent' s argument that the third policy reporting

16

prevision doesn’t save the First Amendment matter in

17

this case for the government.

18

for example, that because there were these third

19

reports, there was the possibility, the possibility that

20

individuals could be identified who were not involved in

21

The government argues,

But the government itself recognized in a

23

variety of memoranda in this record that these who would

24

be identified by third party reportings would be the

25

vocal proponents of nonregistration.

There is not a single piece of evidence in

in the hearings which the government cites that

indicates that this individual was anything but

hypothetical, the individual who would be reporting

24

outside protected speech.

25

QUESTION £

But you concede that the stated

policy would have admitted that prosecutions would he

2

based also cn third party reports.

3

MR. ROSENBAUM:

I would concede that only if

4

we regard this case in a most abstract sense, and net

5

lock in the real world, as the government itself

6

understood, how in fact it would be enforced, that tbe

7

possibility of a significant number of individuals

8

reported by methods not related to use of speech,

9

exercise of speech, could be involved.

10

And, Justice O'Connor, in your decision in the

11

Minneapolis case,

12

and paper tax case, the Court there stated that a

13

special tax that singled out the newspaper for a unicue

14

burden, a unique disadvantage, would be unconstitutional

15

because of the special disfavor that it placed the First

16

Amendm ent.

Now, imagine in that case if Minnesota

responded to that decision and said, we will enlarge the

there was some evidence of the only piece of information

Now, once Selective Service got its pool cf

6

number was narrowed down to about 133.

Those were then sent to the Eepartment cf

8

Justice, and the U.S. Attorney would send at least one

letter advising cnce again cf the registration in lieu

10

of prosecution alternative, and then in most cases,

11

including the petitioner Wayte, there was also a visit

12

from an FBI agent advising him finally of this so-called

13

beg policy.

14

New, it is net surprising under these

15

circumstances that the only person who would be

16

prosecuted as a result of this process would be

17

protesters, but the only reason that it is not

surprising is because the government went the extra mile

to attempt tc implement what has teen its policy

I submit that the key to decision in this case

9

if it satisfies the requirements that this Court has

Nonregistration, by contrast, enjoys no

person *s desire not to register are irrelevant to the

First Amendment.
