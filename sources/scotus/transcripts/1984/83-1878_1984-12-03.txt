never have intended to subject to judicial review the

enforcement decisions of an administrative agency

7

without a clear statement tc that effect.

8

And that’s because this Court for more than a

hundred years has repeatedly held that the decisicrs of

MR. GELLEP.i

Congress has provided.

If Congress has provided a

instances --

QUESTION*

7

MR. GELLER;

It did not in that case.
There's a mandatory duty to

initiate rulemaking, for example, under many statutes:

the OSHA statute, the EFA statute.

If someone claims

10

that that was violated, then the question is obviously

as having a so-called anachronistic ring to

19

it.

The reasons for the settled rule against

20

judicial review of agency enforcement decisions are not

21

very difficult to appreciate.

22

to bring an enforcement proceeding is not simply a

23

mechanical task whereby the agency decides whether they

24

have probable cause to believe the Act has been

25

violat ed.

The decision of whether

hr. Geller,

what if in this case,

20

as I understand your position,

given by the agency had been simply, we have no

MR. GELLER;

Yes.
If the FDA brought an enforcement

proceeding and the states sought to have it dismissed on

the ground that this would not be within the FDA's

jurisdiction, then cf course the courts would have

13

something to review.

15

QUESTION;

16

You don’t think the issue is before

we could decide that in this case?
MR. GELLER;

I think there is a threshold

decision that is subject to judicial review.
