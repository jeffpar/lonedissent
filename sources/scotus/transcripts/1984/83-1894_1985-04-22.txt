We will hear arguments

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE STEPHEN GOLD, ESQ.,
ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLD;

Thank you, Chief Justice, and may

10

it please the Court, this case was precipitated by the

11

fact that the Pattern Makers* league, a union subject to

12

the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Ecard,

13

enacted through a referendum vote and then enforced a

14

constitutional provision providing "No resignation or

15

withdrawal from an association or from the league shall

16

be accepted during a strike or lockout or at a time when

17

a strike or lockout appears imminent."

18

The Labor Board in this case and in a

19

companion case involving the machinists union held that

20

rules of this kind violate Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the

21

National Labor Relations Act.

22

At that time the board was split two to two to

23

one as to the meaning, the precise meaning, I guess it

24

is fair to say, cf Section 8(b)(1)(A).

25

however, the board has made its position crystal clear.

Subsequently,

In the Newfield Porsche case, 270 NLRB Number 209, cited

2

by both parties, the board held that Section 7 of the

3

National Labor Relations Act "expressly grants employees

4

the right to refrain from any and all protected

5

concerted activities.

6

the" -- I am sorry -- "the right to resign union

membership."
And in a subsequent case issued just after

It is our position that the legislative

materials demonstrate that Congress specifically

21

the House wished to regulate in equal detail, and which

the Cenate was unwilling to regulate at that time on the

ground that the National Labor Relations Board should

The house bill was the first one to be passed,

6

and the major points which

7

attention to are the following.

8
9

I wish to draw the Court’s

First of all, the House bill not only retained
Section 7 of the original Wagner Act in basically the

10

form of the original language adding a "right to refrain

11

from concerted activities" to that original language,

12

but made that Section 7(a) rather than Section 7, and

13

added a new Section 7(b) that dealt with the rights of

14

members of labor organizations.

15

And the House Committee report made it plain

16

that this was a new Paragraph (b) and was intended to

17

assure to employees who we subject tc union control scire

18

voice in the

19

union's affairs.

The House bill then contained a Section 8(b)

20

which dealt with union interference with job rights and

21

a Section 8(c) which included Section 8(c)(H), which

22

provided that it should be an unfair labor practice tc

23

deny to any member the right tc resign from the

24

organization

25

at any time.

The explanations of the bill do net contain a

1

hint that Sections 7(a) and 8(b) are general terms of

2

which Section 7(b) and 8(c) were specifics, but rather

3

treat the regulations stated in 7(a) and 7(b) and in

4

8(b) and 8(c) as separate regimes.
The House bill as reported cut in Committee

5

6

and as passed on the floor was the same.

The Senate on

7

the ether hand did change the bill before it from

8

Committee to the floor.
The Senate bill contained -- the Senate

9

10

Committee bill -- excuse me -- contained no "right te

11

refrain" and contained nothing equivalent to Section

12

8(b)(1)(A), but rather only dealt with union

13

interference with the employer’s right to pick his own

14

collective bargaining agents.
And we knew why the Senate Committee bill was

15
16

so limited in a passage which we did not cite in our

17

brief,

18

legislative history of the Act.

but which appears at lage 408 of the two-volume

19

In the Senate report it is stated, "In the

20

course of its deliberations the Committee considered

21

many other proposals such as restricting alleged

22

monopolistic practices by unions, the formulation of a

23

code of rights for individual members of trade unions,

24

and a clarification of the problem of union welfare

25

funds.

"In excluding these natters front the purvies

2

of the bill, the majority of the Committee should not be

3

understood as regarding such proposals as unsound cr

4

unworkable, bur rather than the problems involved should

5

receive more extended study by a special joint

6

Congressional Committee."

7

The Committee was saying, we are not yet

8

prepared to regulate the union-member relationship and

9

rules regarding who will be a union member and who will

not in the sane way we are prepared to reaulate matters

11

considered in the Ccmmmittee bill.

12

Senators Taft and Ball stated that in one --

13

in four particulars, one of which is relevant here, they

14

wished to add to the Senate bill, and they stated that

15

they wished to add what has become the operative

16

language of Section 8(b)(1)(A), language providing that

17

it is an unfair labor practice to restrain or coerce

18

employees in the exercise of Section 7 rights.

19

Their supplemental statement did not take

20

issue with the basic exclusions from the Senate bill as

21

I have just read them.

22

were cutting into that area, but rather they stated

23

just as 8(a)(1) limits the right of employers to

24

interfere with job rights or to use physical force

25

against employees, so should there be a limit on

And that matter was made even more plain on

3

the Senate floor because it was called to the attention

4

of the sponsors of 8(b)(1)(A) that their provision could

5

be read to cut into the right of unions to deny someone

6

membership.

7

If you deny someone membership, you are

8

restricting his Section 7 right to form and join labor

organizations, and the sponsors of the legislation said

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE STEPHEN GOLD, ESQ.,

5

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS - RESUMED

6

MR. GOLDi

7

When we adjourned for lunch, I had brought the

Thank you, Chief Justice.

8

evolution of the Taft-Hartley amendments relative here

9

up to the point of the conference report, and that is

10

the ultimate moment in this story, so I was at least

11

well served ir that regard by the recess.
Very briefly to recapitulate, the House bill

12

13

as we have seen was one which first of all made no

14

claims that the right to refrain and its Section 7(a)

15

had anything to do with the regulation of the

16

union-member relationship, and which did regulate that

17

relationship in detail in a quite different provision of

18

the House bill, namely, Sections 7(b) and 8(c), and

19

which regulated in terms resignation in Section

20

8(c)(4).

21

On the other hand, the Senate bill in terms

22

disclaimed any intention to regulate rules concerning

23

the acquisition or retention of union membership, and

24

both the Committee report on the Senate bill and the

25

authoritative floor statement by the floor leaders who
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

were managing the bill on the Senate side said that the

2

Senate bill dees not reach "the requirements end

3

standards of membership in the union itself."

4

what Senator fall said on the floor.

5

That is

The upshot of the conference was that the

6

House bill was rejected with the following exceptions.

7

The right to refrain language was included in a unitary

8

Section 7, and the Senate bill Section 8(b)(1)(A) which

9

prohibited restraint or coercion with the exercise of

10

Section 7 rights and which contained the limiting

11

provise I have outlined was included in the bill.

12

The explanations of what the conferees did

13

break down into two parts.

14

something affirmative relevant here, and secondly they

15

did something negative.

16

First of all, they did

They explained the addition of the right tc

17

refrain as followed.

18

conjunction with the provisions of Section 8(b)(1) of

19

the conference agreement makes many forms and varieties

20

of concerted activity which the beard, particularly in

21

the early days, regarded as protected by the Act

22

unpretec ted."

23

That addition

"taken in

So, again, as was true throughout the history

24

on the House side,

the right to refrain was discussed in

25

terms of placing a limitation on what the board could
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

require, and as I am making it plain that certain forms

2

of coercive -- physical coercion would be unlawful and

3

not at all explained as having anything to do with union

4

membership.

5

Secondly,

the House conferees said Section

6

8(c) of the House bill contained detailed provisions

7

dealing with the relations cf labor organizations with

8

their members.

9

this section is included in the conference agreement,

One of the more important provisions cf

10

Section 8(b)(5), and has already been discussed.

That

11

was the provision on "extortionate initiation fees."

12

The other parts of this subsection are omitted

13

from the conference agreement as unfair labor practices,

14

sc both the affirmative, namely, the House said we

15

prevailed on one portion of Section 8(c) which became

16

the initiation fee provision of the conference bill, and

17

we did net prevail cn any cf the ethers.

18

unfair labor practices in the conference agreement.

19

They are net

In the first argument in this case, the Deputy

20

Solicitor General suggested that the House didn’t

21

concede on substance, but only tactically, that the

22

matter was left in general terms for future

23

determination by the Labor Eoard, that the agreement to

24

include the right tc refrain in Section 8(b)(1)

25

We have again, because I must say that I had

1
2

never contemplated that explanation of what the

3

conferees had dene in light cf the conference report and

4

the House conferees’ concession reviewed the legislative

5

materials and in the explanation cf Section 8(b)(5) by

6

Senator Taft to the Senate we have found the following,

7

which I would like to press on the Court.

8

to quote it.

I would like

In the House bill union initiation fees were

9

10

among ten previsions providing for certain rights and

11

immunities of members of labor organizations against

12

arbitrary action by the officers of a union to which

13

they belonged.

14

subsection in the House bill.

This was the sc-called bill of rights

The Senate conferees refused to agree to the

15
16

inclusion of

17

since they felt it was unwise to authorize an agency cf

18

the government to undertake such elaborate policing cf

19

the internal affairs of unions as this section

20

contemplated without further study of the structure cf

21

unions.

22

this subsection in the conference agreement

And I would remind the Court of the language

23

of the Senate Committee report which bears a striking

24

resemblance tc this language, namely, the Senate’s

25

reluctance at the beginning cf this process and the
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Senate's reluctance in conference as stated here to

2

acquiesce to the House's desire to give the board the

3

authority to regulate the union member relationship in

4

detail.
And the upshot, we submit, is that there is

5

6

nothing in this legislative history which supports the

7

assertion that the right to refrain was intended to

8

create a right to become a union member at will.
QUESTION;

9

Well, Hr. Gold, last time I asked

10

you the question that aside from the legislative history

11

the language of the Act would leave room for the board’s

12

construction.

13

HR. GOLD;

Justice White --

14

QUESTION;

Or you thought it did.

15

MR. GOLD;

I still do.

16

QUESTION;

But it is sc -- you have to look at

17

the legislative history to evidence that bars the

18

board's construction, not that supports it.

19

MR. GOLD;

Nc, I do believe that the board

20

QUESTION;

And I understand that your

21

quotation from Senator Taft is directed at that very

22

point.
MR. GOLD;

Yes, exactly at the point that we

24

know why the Senate refused to accept the House

QUESTION;

Dc you think that legislative

2

history bars shat would otherwise be a rational

construction cf

the Act?

NR. GOLD:

I believe it bars what would

otherwise be a possible construction of the Act if --

6

QUESTION;

I don’t mean if it were only, but

7

absent the legislative history, there would be room for

8

the board's construction, which means that et least it

is rational.
MR. GOLD:

Yes, I will not quarrel with that.

12

language and

13

argue that the language cuts against what the board is

14

doing,

15

art of dealing with matters that the legislature has

16

left open, and I have to say that there are ambiguities

17

in that language, just the way there --

18
19

If all we had was the right to refrain

the language of Section 8(b)(1), I

would

tut obviously the art of administration is the

QUESTION;

It seems they left an awful lot

open for the board to do.

20

MR. GOLD;

That is correct.

21

QUESTION:

They didn’t specify every kind cf

22

unfair labor practice known to man.

23

MR. GOLD;

Absolutely correct, but --

24

QUESTION;

And ordinarily, Mr. Gold, from this

25

lecturn, from counsel for the unions, including yourself

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

at times, there is a great emphasis placed on deference

2

tc the agency that Congress has entrusted with

3

interpreting and applying and fitting these provisions

4

to a very, very difficult, sensitive area.
HR. GOLDj

5

But I think it is also true, and I

6

hope it is tree, Chief Justice, that we have always

7

stressed, because it happens tc be correct, that the

8

ultimate touchstone is the intention of Congress.

9

Congress’s intention can be more clear and less clear.

10

There comes a point in which Congress has

11

spoken in sufficient clarity that the board may not

12

act.

13

QUESTION :

Do you know of some other Labor

14

Beard case where we have differed with the board based

15

solely on the legislative history, even though the

16

statute itself would permit that construction?

17
18

HR. GOLD;

Well, Curtis Brothers, on which we

rely most heavily, is the clearest --

19

QUESTION;

Is that the closest one?

20

MR. GOLD:

I think plainly the closest one

21

because the sequence is the same.

I would take it,

22

that Bell Aerospace is a case in which if the

23

legislative history hadn’t indicated what Congress

24

wanted to bring within the statute, wanted to leave

25

outside the statute, the board might have prevailed.

(202) 628-9300

too,

In ether words, Congress’s job is to say these

1
2

areas which it is leaving for administration and these

3

areas which it is closing to administration.

4

This Court has the ultimate authority in

5

reading the language against the background of the

6

legislative history to say when a subject matter has

7

been denied to the administrative authority, and we

8

believe that however much deference the beard is

9

entitled to in this instance the legislative materials

10

are toe clearly opposed to what the board did to permit

11

the result that the board reached.
And I wish in that connection to emphasize

12

13

that the board never even sought to confront these

14

materials.

15

refrain came from or about Section 7(b) or about the

16

fate of that section and Section 8(c), or about what the

17

conference report said.

18

There is not a word about where the right to

by what Senator Taft said.

The fact of the matter is that the first

requisite for deference here, namely, that the agency do

what is required of it, namely, to recreate the gamut cf

here .

Both on the merits then and for that reason

the hoard is entitled to no deference, and the hoard's

view is plainly opposed to Congress's view.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS

"compulsion by intimidating practices," and I quote

2

here, "to become or remain a member," and then the

3

famous 8(c)(4) again.

4

So what we have is a statute which legislated

5

not only belt and suspenders style,

The real

The Senate was concerned with three major

getting supervisors out from under the Act.

11

The House, although it was concerned with

12

those things, too, had other fish to fry.

It was very

13

interested in doing things like subjecting unions to the

14

antitrust law, in enacting a detailed bill of rights for

15

clearly internal matters, such as union elections and

16

free speech and dues and union pension benefits and sc

17

on.
And I must say I think it begs the question

18
19

entirely to treat this matter of the right to resign as

20

if it were a purely internal matter.
Now, true enough, the House receded on some of

21

22

these extravagant provisions they wished to enact, but

23

it is striking that the Senate did yield on two points.

24

First,

25

original bill.

the Senate accepted what it never had in its

29
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

It accepted the Section 7 right to refrain,

2

and it accepted it for the purpose of establishing what

3

Senator Taft describes as the right of a man to go back

4

to work if he wants to go back to work, and moreover it

5

accepted the louse Section 8(b)(1) which spoke of

6

coercion by intimidating practices in respect to certain

7

specific rights, and it expanded and broadened it, as

8

the House report said, to the present 8(b)(1)(A), which

9

speaks of outlawing such coercion as would prevent --

10

wnich speaks in general terms with restraint and

11

coercion with Section 7 rights in general.

12

So, what we propose is that the Senate moved

13

beyond the House's overly specific, often duplicative,

14

sometimes extravagant language to more appropriate, mere

15

general, almost constitutional language as befits a

16

statute which was intended to set the structure of unicn

17

management individual relations for years to come, and

18

in this spirit we must approach the board's ruling.

19

Is it inconsistent with that fundamental

20

structure and with, the decisions of this Court?

21

was some mention of the one other case in which an

22

argument based cn what isn’t in the statute somehow

23

should conclude that what is in the statute doesn’t mean

24

what it naturally seems to mean, and that was the Curtis

25

Brothers case.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

There

I should simply like to say that in the Curtis

1
2

Brothers case which dealt with recognition of picketing

3

it was not only a negative inference from the

4

legislative history that we worked with there but the

5

fact that there was a specific and narrow elaborate

6

treatment of that same issue in the final act as it war

7

enacted, and that is a very different matter from

8

negative inferences, from matters which were excluded cr

24

that in this extravagant House bill no one ever claimed

25

that the right to refrain dealt with anything other than

31
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

the right not to participate in union activity in the

2

first place, exactly what it connotes.
Secondly, the conferees did not, as my brother

3
4

Fried said, accept the House bill's Section 8(b)(1).

5

The confereees, as the conference report squarely said,

6

accepted the Senate’s Section 8(b)(1)(A) complete with

7

its provisio, which again was not a provision which was

8

never explained, but which was explained, explained

9

against the background of what the Senate Committee said

10

and explained on the floor.
And while the Deputy Solicitor General quotes

11
12

one statement made by Senator Foiling which indicates

13

that a focus cf the bill, of the proviso to Section

14

8(b)(1)(A) was on permitting unions to explel, there

15

were four explanations of the provision, the other three

16

far broader than that, and the confusion here is the

17

confusion between a core example and the limits of the

18

bill.

19

And finally, we would suggest to you that

20

there is no overall principle cf the statute which

21

creates a concept of free association of the kind that

22

is being discussed here.

23

The bill incorporates the normal concept cf

24

free association which this Court far later articulated

25

in Democratic Party of the United States, namely that

Everybody has a right to proffer his

5

the parties agree, and Congress in this Act said, as has

7

always been true, that unions could determine who would

8

become a member and what the terms of that membership

9

would be subject as the unions have always been to the

10

limits of the normal rules of private assication which

11

is, if you have nothing in your constitution, there is

12

no limitation, and on the other normal rule of
