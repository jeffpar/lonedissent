ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. LANDRY:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court;

Ms. Oberly, I think you

Respondent in this case was convicted cf being
a convicted felon in possession of a firearm.

The Court

10

cf Appeals reversed the conviction cn the theory that

11

the guns found in Respondent's car were the fruits cf an

12

illegal arrest.

13

ground s:

14

The court's ruling was based on two

First, the court held that investigatory

15

steps,

16

when the police reasonably suspect that a crime is

17

ongoing at the moment cf the investigatory step.

18

Because that was not the case here — Respondent was

19

stepped in connection with a rebbery that had teen

20

committed two weeks earlier — the court concluded that

21

this cculd not be a valid investigatory stop case.

22

commonly known as Terry stops, may only be made

The court then treated the case as an arrest

23

case and concluded that the officers who made what we

24

consider the step,

25

lacked probable cause for an arrest because the facts

neighboring police department saying that Respondent was

in connection with an armed robbery that had been

5

In our view,

the Court of Appeals' analysis

6

was fundamentally flawed by its initial ruling on the

7

scope of investigatory stops.

8

somewhat hard to believe that the court meant what it

9

said, because there is no decision of this Court that

We actually find it

10

limits investigatory stops to ongoing crimes, and in

11

fact the Court has repeatedly said, as have most cf the

12

other circuits, that a police officer having reasonable

13

suspicion may stop when he suspects that a crime is

14

being committed, is about to be committed, or has teen

15

committed in the past.

16

QUESTION*

Ms. Oberly, do you take the

17

position that a Terry stop could be made to investigate

18

a past misdemeanor offense?
MS. OBERLY*

19

I think that it probably could

20

be, Your Honor, although this here is a past felony

21

offense.

They certainly cculd, Your

And flyers come, just like informant's tips,
come in all shapes and sizes.
QUESTION:

Except that the police can control

12

what they put in the flyers, but you can’t control the

13

informer's tips.

14

MS. OBERLY:

Yes, Your Honor.

The testimony

15

in this case was that this type of flyer is as common as

16

a flyer that actually expressly indicates an arrest

17

warrant has been issued; and that the Kentucky officers

18

who made the stop found in their experience that this

19

type of flyer generally was followed by an arrest

20

warrant; and that one of the officers recalled having

21

been told that a warrant would be forthcoming in this

22

case.

23
24
25

All that testimony is in the joint appendix
from the suppression hearings.
QUESTION:

But if the flyer had said there is

have even stopped him?

3

MS. OEERLY;

Net necessarily, Your Honor,

because the flyer was issued six days before the

Then we switched -- the radio communication

switches to the despatcher trying to get information out

12

of Cincinnati records about whether there is or is net

13

the officers are following Respondent to where they

So that at the time they,

the officers, converge on where the Respondent is and

3

QUESTION;

Ms. Oberly, would it make any

4

difference in this case if the St. Bernard police in

5

fact didn’t have enough information to justify a

6

reasonable Terry step?

7

MS. OBERLY;

Yes, Your Honor, that would be

8

critical.

In our view where the Court cf Appeals went

9

wrong here was in focusing cn the information that the

10

Covington officers knew.

11

St. Bernard officers knew.

12

What’s relevant is what the

The district court here found that the St.

13

Bernard officers had er.cugh information -- had enough

14

probable cause to arrest the Respondent.

15

doesn’t have to reach that issue.

16

conclude is that the St. Bernard officers had reasonable

17

suspicion to justify a Terry stop of Respondent if they

18

had encountered him first.

19

This Court

All the Court has to

If they had, then what the Covington officers

20

are doing is basically acting as the agents of the St.

21

Bernard officers.

22

QUESTION;

And if the St. Bernard officers did

23

not have sufficient information in their possession to

24

justify issuance of the flyer, you would suggest the

25

evidence should be suppressed,

is that right?

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MS. OEERLYj

Under this Court's ruling in

2

Whiteley versus Warden, that would be the result, unless

3

-- and

4

the exception would be if the Covington officers had

5

somehow prior to the step developed their own

6

information to justify a stop.

we don't contend it's present in this case, tut

7

But since they were making the stop here

8

solely in reliance on the St. Bernard flyer, the

9

validity of that step turns back to the validity of the

10

issuance of the flyer.

11

QUESTION i

Do you take the position that the

12

St. Bernard police could properly ask another police

13

department to detain the Respondent until they got there

14

for something like that, or are you just asking this

15

Court to determine that a Terry stop can be made long

16

encugh

17

outstanding?

18

jy

to determine whether there is a warrant

MS. OBERLY i

For this case, we only ask that

19

you determine the latter, that the Terry step may be

20

made long enough to determine if there's a warrant

21

outsta nding.

22

QUESTIONi

Well, are you suggesting, then,

-23

that we’re to decide this case on the premise that the

24

stop by the Kentucky officers was only until they had

25

time enough to find out whether an arrest warrant had

1

When the first backup unit arrived, the

2

officer in that car immediately spotted part of the gun

3

in plain view in the car, and at that point the warrant

flyer completely drops out of the case and the basis for

5

everything that happened after that point is the

Covington officer’s own independent observation of the

gun in plain view in the car.

8
9

To sum up, it’s cur position on the two points
in the Court’s analysis that* Terry steps simply can't

10

rationally be limited to ongoing crimes; and second,

11

that this Court’s holding in Whiteley versus Warden

12

makes it quite clear that officers of one department are

13

entitled to rely on information supplied by officers of

14

a second department, so long as the first department has

15

the requisite reasonable suspicion or probable cause, as

16

the case may be, to justify the action that's taken.

\

17

QUESTION*

Us. Oberly, if you’re summing up,

18

does the record tell us — because these words "tcck

19

off” create an impression that may be inaccurate, dees

20

the record tell us the length of time between when the

21

vehicle started to move and when it was stepped?

22

MS. OBERLY*

It does not tell us precisely.

23

Your Honor.

But based on the radio transmission which

24

was going on at the same time, it had to have been a

25

period of two minutes or less.

All of this was

happening simultaneously.

2

QUESTION;

And as I remember it, the

3

magistrate indicated that one of the officers said there

4

had been no violation, no speeding in violation of law

5

that he observed before stopping him; is that right?

6

MS. OBERLY;

That's correct.

And they never

7

testified or attempted to justify the stop based on

8

their own observation of a violation of law.

9

QUESTION;

So should we judge the case as

10

though the words "took off” merely meant they have

11

started the vehicle in motion?

12

MS. OBERLY;

That is not the way I would judge

13

— it's not a common sense reading of the words "took

14

off."

15
16

QUESTION;

Well, what do you interpret them to

mean?

17

MS. OBERIY;

I interpret it, in the context of

18

a police radio transmission, that one officer says he

sees the suspect, the suspect saw him and immediately

20

took off, as an indication of flight.

MR. DRENNEN;

Mr. Chief Justice, members cf

13

This case, as it gets further along, tends to

14

get more and more blown out of proportion.

15

that we originally dealt with at the district court

16

level and the reason that the state court transcript is

17

before you and was before the district judge was to

19

did the officer mean by "take off."

20

The case

If you read Cfficer Eger's testimony on page

21

40 cf the joint appendix, his testimony was at that

22

point in time he said hello to Mr. Hensley, told him he

23

was obstructing traffic, and told him tc mcve along.

24

And he then got on the radio and made an inquiry as to a

25

flyer.

Now, it should be noted that then other

officers began their conversations concerning this, and

the despatcher said there is nc flyer.

again look back at their testimony, and their testimony

was that they didn't recall whether it had been two

months that they had heard it, two weeks that they had

MR . DRENNENi

I'm not asking you to lock

inside the officer’s head.

is that the situation is such that it is in this

QUESTIONi

Well, if the officer could

what had happened here at the time the gun was seen,

then don't we stop there?

13

HR. DRENNEN:

No.

Your situation is one cf,

14

number one, that an officer in his normal course of

15

business runs across many things.

16

just simply following up information — he sees the

17

individual, he is simply saying, look, someone wants to

18

talk to you — I don’t see that as necessarily an

19

abusive act on his part.

20

But when

If the officer is

22

that the St. Bernard police could not properly ask

Cne is Terry stops are not and cannot be

say that criminals are home free once they get away with

their crime and

It simply makes no sense to

would strongly urge that that aspect of the Court of

Appeals' ruling be reversed.

12

The second point is that it has long been

13

recognized by this Court and the Courts of Appeals that

14

police departments must and are able to cooperate with

15

each other; that it is not necessary that they

16

cross-examine each other about the basis of the first

department's knowledge.

18

And in this case there was no reason that the

19

Covington officers had to know precisely what the St.

20

Bernard officers had tc know.

21

the Court of Appeals required in this case.

22

the stop -- the arrest was defective because the

Covington officers did not have the personal knowledge

that the St. Bernard officers had.

personal knowledge is not required.
