CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER;

2

We will hear arguments

first this morning in Pattern Makers* league v. the

4

National Labor Relations Board.
Mr. Gold, you may proceed whenever you're

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAURENCE GOLD, ESQ.

8

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. GOLD;

9

Chief

Justice, and may it please

10

the Court, the question in this case is whether the

11

National Labor Relations Board is correct in its ruling

12

that all Union rules placing restrictions on the time

13

and circumstances under which a member may resign from

14

the Union are invalidated by Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the

15

National Labor Relations Act, as amended, is correct.
The facts which raise that question are

16
17

these;

18

its constitution and bylaws which we set out at page 3

19

of cur brief, the blue brief, which states;

20

resignation or withdrawal from an Assocication or from

21

the League shall be accepted during a strike or lockout

22

or at a time when a strike or lockout appears imminent."

23

The Pattern Makers* Union adopted a provision in

That provision was considered at the Union’s

24

convention in 1976 and then was sent to a referendum of

25

the Union's members, and finally approved and became

some eleven members of those local Unions put in

The Union, when the strike was finally

Charges were served, a trial was held, and the

9

10

result was that the case went to the National Labor

11

Relations Board on the allegation that the Union's

12

action in seeking to discipline these individuals for

13

violating the Union's underlying rule that engaging in

14

strike-breaking activity is unlawul as a matter of Union

15

law, violated Section 8(b)(1)(A).

16

QUESTION;

What panel did the Union impose?

17

MR. GOLD;

The Union imposed on the

18

individuals for engaging in the strike-breaking

19

act iv ity.

22

QUESTION;

The fines amounted to all of their

salaries earned when they went back to —
MR. GOLD;

My memory, Justice O'Connor, is

23

that the fines were in the amount earned while engaging

24

in strike-breaking activity.

25

And, of course, the question of the state of

(202) 628-9300

1

those fines is a matter for state law to determine under

2

this Court's decisions in the Boeing L Machinist case.

3

The validity of the fines,

4

in amount, and so on are a matter of the state law of

5

membership associations and the state law of contracts;

6

and the extent to which the fines are enforceable,

7

Court has held, is to be determined in that forum.

this

So all we have is in inchoate action by the

9

whether the fine's reasonable

subject to only one means of enforcement; namely,

10

a state court lawsuit to collect the amounts in question

11

with the law on what is collectible, a matter of state

QUESTION:

13
14

fact,

Do you know whether the fines, in

have been paid?

15

MR. GOLD;

My understanding is they have not.

16

QUESTION;

Well, could the Union expel these

17

members for failure to pay the fines so that they

18

wouldn't have to resort to state court collection

19

proceedings under state law?

20

MR. GOLD;

Yes.

There are, as we understand

21

the law developed by this Court from Allis Chalmers

22

through Machininsts Z. Eoeing, two lawful methods for

23

enforcing a rule against strike-breaking against full

24

Union members.

25

Obviously, unless the person chooses to join

the Union, to become a full Union member and be bound by

2

the constitution, the Union can’t take any disciplinary

3

action.

4

But if somebody, as in this case, and it’s

5

conceded, if someone joins a Union, becomes a full

6

member, agrees to abide by the constitution and bylaws,

7

then the Union has two choices;

8

which leads to expulsion; two, to take action which

9

leads to a fine which can be attempted

10

to be enforced

through court action.
Those are the only two options open to the

11

12

one, to take action

Union.
QUESTION;

13

N ow, has the Union p ermanen tly

14

giv en up the opportuni ty to expel here by imposing a

15

fine,

16

under its own constitu tion, say well, you failed to pay;

17

we ’ re go ing to expel y cu for that.

or could it, if the fine proved unc ollectible

MR . GOLD;

18

I presume — I 've ne ver seen a case

I presu me that a Union whi ch first seeks

19

of tha t kind.

20

a fine

21

that t he fine is too h igh an amount or pr ocedurally

22

imposed in an imperfec t way, would still have the option

23

of explusion.

The only arg ument

T

can see the other way is

that there is some cho ice of remedies or waiver by the

Onion.

I don't think that would be the rule.

Usually,

2

Unions seek to go one way or the other initially.

3

many Unions, the complaint, internal complaint filed

4

against the members, says what the penalty being sought

5

will be.

In

And some Union constitutions provide that if

6
7

the only penalty that can be imposed is that which

the

8

member has been given fair notice of, so that he can

9

make his determination whether to defend or not.
Some people faced with expulsion wouldn't

10

11

choose

12

later and try to collect a fine from them.

13

Union constitutions treat that issue in different ways.

14

tc defend, and It would be unfair to come around

QUESTION;

So different

I take it you will address the

15

question of judicial deference to the Laurence view of

16

the matter.

17

MR. GOLD;

Oh, absolutely, Chief Justice.

18

The argument we make here is that the language

19

and legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act shows

20

that Congress gave the most mature and complete

21

consileration to the entire question of the extent to

22

which the Labor Board should be empowered to regulate

23

the Union/Member relationship, and that in particular,

24

the House of Representatives proposed that it be an

25

unfair labor practice for a Union to limit resignation

1

in any way, shape, or form; where the Senate took a

2

quite different view.

3

demonstrates in this instance, as in many others, that

4

the House receded to the Senate.

And that conference report

In other words, our position here is that

5

6

Congress made a considered decision to deny the Labor

7

Board the authority to dictate to Unions what their

8

rules should be on who may join the Union, the

9

conditions under which that person may join, position,

10

the conditions under which he may be expelled, and the

11

conditions under which he may otherwise leave the

12

Union.

24

MR. GOLD;

All that the record shows, Justice

12

of tho se days to say I don't choose to be a member of

14

This is a narrow and pointed restriction on

15

the ab ility to resign, one which is attendant to a

16

p a r ti c ular moment of the utmost importance to the

17

organi zation, the strike period with its attendant

If that were a waiver, the Board says it's not

QUESTION;

Of course, your position is that he

That's right.

QUESTION;

MR. GOLD;

Yes.

Cur primary position is that

Congress made a basic judgment.
QUESTION;

Limited these rights to the extent

necessary to let the Union run its own affairs.

11

MR. GOLD;

That's correct.

12

QUESTION;

And I take it that you rest on the

legislative history.

14

MR. GOLD;

Yes.

15

QUESTION;

If there was nothing but the

MR. GOLD;

Yes.

The language -- it seems to

helpful to the Government, but —

QUESTION;

The language is hardly

Well, unless you are inclined to

22

say that if the Board gave it a permissible reading,

23

you'd think it.

24
25

MR. GOLD;
Justice White.

That is what I was about to say,

I don't think it is very helpful, but I
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

could not say

2

QUESTION;

That the language wins your case.

3

MR. GOLD;

Forces a decision in our favor.

I

4

do think the language cuts in our favor in two different

5

respects:

6

refrain from concerted activities, and it seems to us

7

the choice of the word "refrain" is a surprising one to

8

denote a right to join an organization which has a rule

9

limiting resignation, and say I will join, but I am

one, the section 7 right is a right to

10

joining free and clear of that rule, and I won’t respect

11

it and

12

then to leave at will any time I say.
So I don’t think the language pushes in the

13
14

Government’s direction.
QUESTION:

15
16

I have a right that Congress gave me to join and

You're very close to a waiver

argument there.
KR. GOLD:

17

I think that the argument -- and

18

we’ve gone back and forth in our minds whether or not

19

the argument is a waiver or an argument simply that this

20

is a narrow right, a right not to join in the first

21

place.

22

Secondly, Section 8(b)(1)(A) was not in the

23

Senate committee bill.

It was added on the floor by

24

Senators Taft and Ball, and in adding it they excepted

25

an amendment by Senator Holland, adding the proviso to
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the amendment, the proviso that says that nothing in the

2

body of the amendment which prohibits restraint and

3

coercion is intended to interfere with the right of

4

Unions to prescribe their own rules with respect to the

5

acquisition or retention of membership.

6

QUESTION:

Isn't this the kind of question

7

that traditionally, courts have traditionally given the

8

Labor Board a great deal of elbow room?

9

MR. GOLD*

I think that this is, Chief

10

Justice, the kind of question where the Board has the

11

least possible elbow room.

12

that I had to present to you was the bare language of

13

the statute, unexplained by its evolution and by what

14

its sponsor said, that this might be an area in which

15

the Board's expertise weighs heavily.

16

I would concede that if all

But that is simply not the situation here.

17

Congress was considerate enough, good enough to debate

18

these matters at great length.

19

as I was saying in the Senate, expressed statement by

20

the sponsors of Section 8(b)(1)(A) that they had no

21

intent to intervene in internal Union affairs and to

22

regulate the Union/Member relationship.

23

And what we see is (a),

And then when we move to the House, we find a

24

very different situation.

In the House, there was a

25

Section 7(a) in the House bill, very much like Section 7
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

now, including these words "granting individual

2

employees the right to refrain from concerted

3

activities," and a Section 7(b) which regulated, which

4

gave Union members rights,

5

organization.

6

vis a vis the labor

And in the House bill, there was a Section

7

8(B) which is very much like Section 8(b)(1)(A)

8

dealing with this general question of restraint and

9

coercion, basically physical coercion and interference

10
11

now,

with job rights.
QUESTIONi

Mr. Gold, was there any discussion

12

before or after or during the conference report with

13

respect to this specific problem?

14

MR. GOLD4

Yes.

15

QUESTIONi

Whether a Union could fine a member

16
17

for strike-breaking?
MR. GOLDi

No, Justice White.

I cannot say

18

that the discussion was in that specificity, but the

19

discussion was as follows.

20

of the statement of the House managers who would

21

certainly take the kindest view as to what --

statements do you most strongly relate?
MR. GOLD;

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

background to this statement
The House passed a bill that had a Section

2
3

7(b) which gave rights to individuals as Union members

4

and a Section 8(c)(4) which specifically stated that

5

Union members would have a right to resign at will, and

6

that it was an unfair labor practice to limit that

7

right.
The bill went to conference.

8
9

8(c) were dropped.

Section 7(b) and

The House conferees said Section

10

8(c) of the House bill contained detailed provisions

11

dealing with the relations of labor organizations with

12

their members.
One of the more important provisions of this

13
14

section, that limiting the initiation fees which a labor

15

organization may impose, where a permitted Union shop or

16

maintenance of membership agreement is in effect, is

17

included in the conference agreement.

18

8(b)(5) and, has already been discussed, the other parts

19

of this subsection are omitted from the conference

20

agreement as unfair labor practices.
The House managers had the political job of

21
22

going back

23

as was possible.

language says we tried to regulate internal Union

2

affairs; we succeeded in -- we tried to regulate

3

internal Union affairs in Section 7(b) of our bill and

4

8(c) of our bill; we saved Section 8(b)(5) on initiation

5

fees;

we lost on everything else.
Senator Taft told the Senate that with regard

6
7

to the scope of 8(b)(1) which he and Senator Ball had

8

said was not intended to get into internal Union

9

affairs, the conference bill was the same as the Senate

10

bill.
Now, the Board which admits that all of these

11

12

materials are embodiments of Congress’

13

be explained, says that while no one -- no one -- so

14

statel

15

was by adding the words the "right to refrain" in

16

Section 7,

the intent to create a right to resign at will, quite

happened to Section 7(b) and 8(c)(4).

But that’s an argument that the

22

what -- 8(c)?

23

MR. GOLD;

Yes, Your Honor.

24

QUESTION;

Failure to include that, that

25

supposedly limits the meaning of 7(a) is your argument?

Neither the House nor the Senate ever claimed

3

that Section 7 or 7(a) of the House bill or Section

8(b)(1) regulated internal Union affairs or this

5

particular aspect of internal Union affairs.
And indeed, unless the Board is correct that

6
7

Section 7(b) and 8(c)(4) of the House bill were

8

completely redundant, the fair inference is that both

the House and the Senate saw the issue of regulating

11

MR. GOLD:

12

I know that’s what you say, but
They lost that unfair labor

But that's the argument here.

The

13

argument here is precisely that while they lost that

14

unfair labor practice, that the Labor Board has the

15

power under 8(b)(1)(A) which was never claimed to give

16

the Board the power, the authority to recreate that

17

unfair labor practice, and to do so out of whole cloth.

at all.

constitution, and that union's have no right to take

2

diciplinary action against non-members without engaging

3

in a wrong.

4

The question here is whether the Board has the

5

power to truncate the Union member contract by

6

substituting its view that there is something somewhere

7

in some brooding omnipresence in the sky that says that

8

every Union rule limiting the right to resign is an

9

unfair labor practice.

10

And our point is that nothing in Section 7(a),

11

nothing in Section 7 as enacted, nothing in Section

12

8(b)(1), authorizes the Board to create that unfair

13

labor practice; that the provisio to 8(b)(1)(A) in terms

14

denies the Board that authority, and that the

15

legislative history shows that Section 7 was not

16

intended to give the Board that authority, and. that the

17

fate of Sections 7(b) and 8(c)(4) demonstrates that this

18

was not an issue of which Congress was unaware, but

rather an issue where there were two different views.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF CHARLES FRIED, ESQ.

19

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENTS
MR. FRIED:

20

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

21

please

the Court, having decided that a Union commits an

22

unfair labor practice by seeking court-enforceable fines

23

against members who have resigned to go back to work

24

during a strike, the Court considers today the Board

25

ruling that a Union may not accomplish precisely the

2

resignations by those who would go back to work.

3

Now, in considering that Board ruling,

4

respectfully remind the Court that the Court has

5

frequently said that the interpretation of the Act is in

6

the first instance for the Board, and that that

7

interpretation by the Board of its Act is due great

deference, so long as its interpretation is -- and I

case -- "not inconsistent with the fundamental structure

11

of the Act."
Therefore, I think it is helpful to consider

13

at the outset what the fundamental structure of the Act

14

is.

15

And surely there is nothing more fundamental tc the

the Congress sought to enlarge that

23

charter of liberties and tc add -- and I quote here from

24

the preamble of the Taft-Hartley Act -- "further rights"

25

-- and

I quote here — "to protect the rights of
21
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

individual employees in their relations with labor

2

organizations."

3

So that when the first part of Section 7 was

4

enacted, it protected the rights of employees, vis a vis

5

employers; the second part, which added the words "and

6

shall also have the right to refrain from any and all

7

such activities" created an enlargement and a symmetry

8

in speaking of the individual's rights vis a vis labor

9

organi zations.

10

Now, in the early days of Section 7 of the

11

Wagner Set, employers regularly came to the Board and

12

came to the Court to argue that they had made bargains

13

with employees in which employees had bargained away

14

those great rights, and they had made fair bargains,

15

reasonable bargains, bargains for a limited time only,

16

and that the employees had struck those bargains with

17

their eyes open.

18

And the Board and the Court regularly turned

19

those arguments down, saying that Section 7 rights

20

cannot be bargained away.

21

is National Licorice.

22

understanding of the fundamental structure of the Act is

23

that the right in the second part of Section 7 alsc

24

cannot be bargained away, no matter how fair the Union

25

provision is, no matter how limited in scope, and no

The great case in this Court

What the Board does here in its

(202) 628-9300

1

matter that the member entered into this bargain,

2

bargaining away his rights with his eyes open.

3

So there is a symmetry here and the structure

4

which the Board discerns seems to us to be a structure

5

which makes sense, which is a coherent structure.

6

Indeed, the only exception which Section 7

7

admits this right to refrain relates to Union security

8

clauses, and this Court was most emphatic over a

9

generation ago in the General Motors case, that

Union

10

may not, by Union security clauses, demand any more than

11

12

allegiance which does not submit an individual worker to

13

Union discipline.

14

QUESTIONi

That is to say, such an

Mr. Fried, has the Board’s

15

interpretation, present interpretation of these

16

provisions been a consistent one throughout the years?

17

MR. FRIEDj

Over the last dozen years,

18

Justice O'Connor, the Board in every major case has held

19

that a Union attempt to impose court-enforceable fines

20

on workers who would go back to work during a strike,

21

when those workers have indicated their desire no longer

22

to be affiliated with the Union, constitutes an unfair

23

labor practice.

24
25

So we don't have here some dramatic U-turn in
the position of the Board, but a consistent picture
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

which the Board has been elaborating since this issue

2

first surfaced, and a picture which this Court has twice

3

added its hand to the elaboration of.

4

Now, the Petitioners rely very heavily on the

5

provisio of Section 8(b)(A).

They rely on the proviso

6

which reserves to the Union the right to make rules

7

regarding the acquisition and retention of membership.

8

The Board's reading of that proviso, we submit, is a

9

perfectly natural reading, but also a reading which

10

carries forward a consistent, a coherent picture of the

11

structure of the Act.
For what it says on one hand under Section 7,

12

13

is the employee's relation to the Union is wholly

14

voluntary.

15

when he wishes.

16

reads it, what Congress is saying, it is voluntary on

the other side of the relationship also.

19

to say, expel the member when it wishes.

20

He may join if he wishes and he may leave
And under the proviso as the Board

The Union may

a member if it wishes and may terminate, that is

Thus, the Board's reading is a reasonable one

21

and makes sense out of the structure of the Act.

22

Petitioners' reading of the proviso would have the word

23

"retention" take on the meaning that the Union has some

24

kind of a power to hold onto a member who no longer

25

wishes to maintain his membership.

15

Well,

Mr. Fried, I take it that

16

your c olleague on the other side seems to agree that if

we war e just looking at the words of the Act and

struct ure, that maybe the Board has got a pretty good

19

case.

20
21

he claims requires that these words be given a different

22

meaning than you are urging.
MR. FRIED;

23

Justice White, if the

24

legislative history plainly indicated an intention of

25

the Congress to allow this kind of strike resignation
fining, we

would not be here, we would not have this case for the

2

third time before the Court.

3

Of course, the legislative history in our view

4

is really guite indeterminate on this point, which is

5

what presents the problem.

6

legislative history that we can come to an elucidation

7

of the meaning of the proviso are the words of Senator

8

Holland himself who was the proponent of the proviso in

9

its present terms to the Senate.

The closest, I think, in the

interpretation contrary to yours.

All you have to do is negative --

It would be helpful, I suppose, if you had
some support.

(Laugh te r.)

18

HR. FRIEDs

The greatest help. Your Honor,

19

which I find in the legislative history is Senator

20

Holland's own explanation of the function of the

21

proviso, for he says -- and I quote from a passage on

22

page 20 of the Petitioners' brief -- that "the function

23

of the proviso has to do with admission and explusion of

24

m em ber s. "

25

And that, of course, is precisely how the

admission and expulsion of members.

accomplish was to reserve to the Onion that same freedom

of action which Section 7 reserved to the individual

6

worker.

7
8

That makes quite

The relationship is voluntary symmetrically on
both sides.

9

QUESTION;

Mr. Fried, may I inquire at this

10

point, because it seems to me their stronger argument

11

does not necessarily rely on the proviso, but rather

12

relies on the fact that the House originated both the

13

words the "right to refrain” and the provision that was

14

deleted that said that this doesn’t affect the right to

15

resign.

16

And if you have those in the same bill that

17

originated in the House, does not that imply that the

18

right to refrain without the other would not encompass

19

the right to resign?

20

HE. FRIED;

Justice Stevens, I think that

21

the implication is wholly indeterminate in that

22

respect.

23

Congressman Hartley, described the Senate -- the final

24

Senate version as being broader in scope in general.

Would it not be true that within the House

MR. FRIED*

Legislation is frequently full

12

of redundant terms, of terms that go over the same

13

grounds in specific ways as well as in general ways.

14

And, therefore, I think what one must ask is whether

15

there is anything in the legislative history which, with

16

sufficient specificity, indicates that by dropping that

17

language the House members were attending to the point

18

which my brother Gold insists they were attending to, or

19

whether they viewed themselves really as acceding to

more general and admittedly more debatable language.

HE. FRIED;

10

It does help, Mr. Chief Justice,

11

but th e Court limits the Board to asking whether its

12

rea din g is not inconsistent with the fundamental

13

struct ure of the Act, and that is why we come back again

14

and ag ain to that fundamental structure.
It is our contention that the structure which

15
16

the Pe titioners urge is not a coherent structure,

wherea s the structure which the Board’s decisions

interpreting the end result.
Do you think that that case poses some support
for your opponent?
MB. FRIED;

It is evidently some support.

I

5

believe it is not sufficient support in the overall

6

context of what is being done.

7

words as he accepted Senator Holland's proviso.

8

accepted the proviso without objection.

9

perfectly understandable for, as he said -- and I quote

I recall Senator Taft's
He

He found it

10

-- his only purpose was, to quote, "outlaw restraint and

11

coercion as would prevent people from going to work if

12

they wanted to go to work."

13

That is how Senator Taft understood the

14

general structure of what he was doing, ane he thought

15

that Senator Holland's proviso fit into that structure

16

perfectly comfortably.

17

Now, therefore, I don't think we need to work

18

the elaborate inferences from enactment and failure to

19

enact which this Court was forced to resort to in the

20

Curtis Brothers case,

21

a decision in favor of the Board's ruling in this case.

22

which I think are not necessary to

I would suggest that the picture which the

23

Petitioners give of the word "retention" in that proviso

24

is a picture which is similar to the word "detention,"

25

that it means that a Union is empowered to hold on to a
32
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1
2

member who no longer wishes to be a member.
And the Petitioners understandably insist upon

3

the fact that after all here, so far as we know, the

4

Union member was well aware of this prevision either at

5

the time he joined the Union or after the League Law 13

6

was passed and when he had a chance to get out.

7

But these Section 7 rights, the Court has said

8

again and again, cannot be bargained away.

So the

9

picture that is being offered by the Petitioners is a

10

picture which the Petitioners, the Union in the Granite

11

State case also offered to this Court, and in their

12

brief they offered a picture of the worker as -- and 1

13

quote here from their brief — "a volunteer for military

14

service, under strict discipline for the duration."

15

Now, the picture which the Board offers of the

16

Union/Member relationship was well stated by Hr. Justice

17

Douglas in that same Granite State case, where he said

18

it was a picture "normally reflected in our free

19

institutions," the right of the individual to join or to

20

resign from associations as he sees fit."

21

The question for the Court is whether the

22

Board correctly understood the fundamental structure of

23

the Act as enacting the military picture of the member

24

as a volunteer for military service or Mr. Justice

25

Douglas's picture.
33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Now, the Petitioners go back to the law of

2

voluntary associations, and properly so, because the

3

great case in this Court on the whole issue of fining

4

Union members is the Allis-Chalmers case.

5

statute says not a word about fining Union members, it's

6

in that case that that right was established.

7

Since the

But the Allis-Chalmers case emphasized that

8

the power to impose court-enforceable fines was

9

predicated on the fact that the fined person "enjoyed

10

full Union membership," and that what was at stake was

11

purely internal -- internal regulation.

12

Now, the state law on voluntary associations

13

is said to clearly require, to clearly recognize the

14

right of a voluntary association to restrict the right

15

of members to resign.

16

Petitioners rely on the weighty authority of corpus

17

juris secundum.

18

And in this regard, the

I would engage in a battle of the giants here

19

and bring in the weighty authority of Am. Jur. Second,

20

which says that a member may lawfully resign at any time

21

from an association or club, and a bylaw which restricts

22

this right or makes the withdrawal subject to the

23

organization's approval is invalid.

24

Well, the fact of the matter is, I would give
no great weight to either of these weighty authorities

because the fact of the matter is that the common law of

2

voluntary associations is underdeveloped and in conflict

3

on the subject of whether an association may or may not

4

restrict an individual in his attempt to resign.

5

One thing, however, is quite clear; that those

6

cases -- and there are cases, common law cases, which

7

recognize an association's right to restrict a member's

8

resignation -- all make it quite clear that those

9

restrictions will be placed under the strictest court

10

scrutiny to see whether they comport with state public

11

policy of fairness.
The question which this Court must consider is

12

13

whether the issue, not of the reasonableness of a Union

14

fine,

15

the question of the outer perimeters of the Union/Member

16

relationship should also be remitted to 50 varying state

17

court policies, so that in one state such a restriction

18

is unreasonable; in another state such a restriction

19

does comport with public policy.

which the Board has with the Petitioners

of the outer limits of a Union's reach over those who

would not be members is no longer merely an internal

matter/ but becomes a matter for federal labor policy, a

a moment with the Court about the effects of this

10

Board's ruling, the Board's ruling on the situation of

11

Unions, because the suggestion is that this ruling is a

12

disast er.

13

It would seem, first of all, that we must

14

recall that this ruling is no great innovation.

15

all, this Court has said in Granite State and in Booster

16

Lodge that a Union may not offer the following bargain

17

to a potential member:

on condition that you agree, having resigned, not to go

back to work during a strike.

merely technical reformulation, they offer a member the

following bargain:

MR. FRIED;

It is a technicality. Justice —

MR. FRIED;

(Laughter.)

ME. PRIED;

QUESTION;

19

But it's a technicality which —
I didn't say it was unimportant.

The other matter which —
Let me ask you one question on

deference, if I may, Mr. Fried.

20

Do you think the issue is one on which, if the

21

Board had gone the other way, it would have been clearly

22

wrong?

23

Or could it have gone either way on this issue?
MR. FRIED;

Had the Eoard -- had the

Board

24

said that a Union may restrict in this unlimited way the

25

right of strike resignation, it is our contention that
37
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

this would be at war with the fundamental structure of

2

the Act.

QUESTION:

3
4

Yes, sir.
Would you say the same thing about

the 30-day provision that two members speculated on?
MS. FRIED:

5

Had the Board decided that a Union

6

is entitled to insist on certain formalities in

7

processing strike resignations, and maybe even including

8

a brief delay during which the Union absorbs the fact

9

that these men are,

10

in fact, resigning, that might well

be within the discretion of the Board.

11

But a restriction as extensive as 30 days

12

raises the very gravest doubts in our mind about it’s

13

consistent with those Section 7 rights and the notion

14

that those rights may not be bargained away.
QUESTION:

15

I suppose one could say that that

16

kind of 30-day provision makes it a harder case for your

17

opposition.
MR. FRIED:

18

It would be a harder case for our

19

opposition, but I don't believe, Mr. Justice Blackmun,

20

that it would be a decision which we would care to

21

defend.
I would like to simply underline one matter in

22
23

terms of the effect of this decision.

For, though the

24

Board adheres fast to the right of a member to leave the

25

Union

and escape the rule, the Court must remember that
38
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

this is not a costless option.

2

be the mandatory bargaining representative of that

3

worker, and in choosing to resign, he loses his voice

4

and he loses his voice most particularly in regard to

5

the question of whether he may participate in a vote to

6

take that unit out on strike, and he loses his voice in

7

deciding whether to accept a new contract -- a new

8

contract to end the strike.

9

The Union continues to

So there is a penalty, there is a price that

10

the man pays when he exists, when he exercises his right

11

under free institutions to exit.

12

Finally, I might say that over the years,

13

employers have found no more effective tactic in arguing

14

against Union representation than to urge that Union

15

membership is like joining the Army.

16

Now, it seems to me that the Board's ruling

17

here would establish once and for all the notion that

18

Union membership is a free relationship, voluntary on

19

both sides, and this may very well open the way to a

20

more solid form of solidarity, based indeed on the fact

21

of an intrinsic loyalty.

22

I thank the Court for it attention.

I would like to warmly impress on

the Court Judge Lernard Hand's injunction that the task

What is self-organization?

What is freedom of

association?

It is not, and was not in Congress's eyes,

13

the right of every individual to join the organization

14

if he wishes and to leave if he wishes.

15

very point of the proviso was to recognize that freedom

16

of association is a group freedom, and the group creates

17

its rules on who may join and who may not join.

Of course,

the

18

An individual who walks up to a Union and says

19

I want to join, but I won't abide by these rules, can be

rejected because Congress's view of the freedom of

association was the contractual view, the view stated by

22

this Court in Democratic Party of the United States, and

23

not the view that Mr. Fried creates out of whole cloth,

and that's the Board,
