question is that the result affects the extent of the

2

submerged lands belonging to Rhode Island and New York

3

as distinguished from the submerged lands of the United

4

States .

5

That arises because under a venerable doctrine

6

the states, each of them on the coast, own the beds and

7

banks of all inland navigable waters within their

8

boundaries, and by virtue of the Submerged Lands Ret of

9

1953,

10
11

they likewise own an additional three-mile belt

measured from the outer limit of those inland waters.
CUESTICH:

14

NR. CLAIECRNE;

It does not,

Justice White.

15

This case is entirely under the Submerged Lands Act, and

16

that Act simply governs the seabed and

17

thereof, the right to extract minerals and the right to

18

take resources, but net fishing, within that zone.

May I just follow up?

What effect

would it have on fishing rights, on electronic

7

ME. CIAIECRNE:

With respect to the latter

8

two, Justice Powell, I think I am correct in saying that

9

it would have no effect on the fishing rights or on the

10

right to exploit the subsoil of the sea, because in both

11

these respects the United States has declared for itself

12

ownership of a zone which goes either 2C0 miles cut or

13

to the edge of the continental shelf, and therefore

14

these areas now in dispute would in no event be open to

15

international exploitation cr tc international fishery

With respect to surveillance, I suppose that

1

MR. CLAIECRNE:

Justice Stevens, you have hit

2

upon the reason why it has traditionally been the policy

3

of the United States as a matter of international

4

relations to confine the high seas close to shore,

5

relatively close to shore, because of the interest cf

6

the United States in avoiding or wanting to avoid

7

setting a precedent which ether nations can immitate and

8

thereby clcse off the areas near their buoys tc

9

international navigation and as well to our surveillance

10

of their activities.

11

QUESTION

i

It is as Your Honcr -The government surely isn’t

12

concerned abcut any navigation problems as between it

13

and the states, is it, because certainly the federal

14

government can regulate to its heart's content in that

15

area.
MR. CLAIBORNE:

16
17
18

I think that is -- Justice

Rehnquist.
As I have indicated in answer to a question

19

from Justice Shite, it is ccmmcn ground in this case

20

that if Long Island is not an extension of the mainland,

21

then the inland waters behind long Island are restricted

22

to what are known as -- what is known as Long Island

23

Sound proper.

the back there are three charts.

KR. CLAIEORNE:

Justice O'Connor, it appears
9

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that at the time when the claim to Block Island Sound

2

matured as a historic claim, the general rule, although

3

it was net properly speaking a rule, but the tendency

4

was to treat waters which were closable by a line

5

something approaching ten miles only would fit that

6

description, and that line at the north between Orient

7

Point and Fisher Island and Napatree Point is a total of

8

less than ten miles, while a line from Nontauck Point to

9

Washkill or much less a line which would include Block

10

Island

would exceed ten miles, and indeed in one case

11

come to 24, or nearby, 24 miles.
Accordingly, those waters were not

Mr. Claiborne, what is the standard

13

"reserved respect and a tacit -- I am reading from Page

district judge sitting as a District Court, but except

2

for matters of credibility where his appraisal of the

3

witnesses must obviously be given more weight than what

4

can be determined cn the cold record, this Court has an

5

obligation to review the evidence to the extent that it

6

is challenged.

7

Here, we say that the Court need go no further

8

than the master's report, because we accept every

9

finding in that report, and so far as I am aware, there

10

is no challenge to any finding of fact in that report by

11

counsel opposite.

12

Accordingly, there is very little occasion in

13

this particular case for the Court to do mere than look

14

at the evidence as summarized by the master.

15

Now, the question whether Long Island is an

16

extension of the mainland,

17

question in this case, is one that has tended only

18

recently to arise and to arise — It is a troubling

19

development that every island somewhere near the shore

20

is now thought of — for being treated as not an island

21

but a peninsula.

22

which is the dispositive

If that tendency were to continue unabated,

23

the number of challenges, hence the original docket of

24

this Court would be severely burdened. Now, our brief

25

traces the history of this notion that an island can

sometimes be viewed not as an island jurisd ictio nally

2

but as an extension of the mainland mass.

It was intended as a very narrow exception to

4

the rule of geography.

5

in the

6

that if one were to take each of the waterways and treat

10

it as separating the mass into islands, Louisiana would

11

wash into the sea.
Accordingly, in that special circumstance , it

12
13

was deemed appropriate, and this was in a case called

14

Louisiana versus Mississippi in 1905, in which this

15

Court said, "To be sure, these are technical islands,"

16

speaking of the St. Eernard peninsula,

17

it as part of the land mass.”

"but we must view

The only other way in which the Court has

18
19

thought it proper to treat islands as part of the land,

20

21

what is the government’s position with respect to

MR. CLAIBORNE;

Justice Stevens, we don't have

24

to resolve that question here, because as it happens,

same
The record in this case does indicate that the

2
3

geographer cf the state — when asked that question in

4

depcsiticn -- he 'died tefore the trial and therefore his

5

deposition was introduced in evidence -- his answer was

6

that Manhattan and indeed Staten Island as well were

7

treated by the committee, the baseline committee which

8

drew the coastline of the United States, as water, as

9

islands and therefore as water because under the rule of

10

Article 7 an island wholly within an indentation is

11

treated as water, tut that is only true with respect to

12

an island, and not with respect to some portion of the

13

land mass.

14

r

It is obviously a- closer question whether

15

Staten Island and Manhattan Island are islands for all

16

purposes.

because there the separation is some seven-tenths of a

deflects the coast if it is treated as an extension of

I

2

say that we can win because of the close re latio nship

between Long Island and the mainland that is

is there because of the other factors which this Court

-- which I have enumerated, and because the Fast River

most workable definition of a hay is the Convention, and

9

the Convention, all the requirements of the Convention

10
11

were found by the master to apply to this area.
Also, the whole concept in international law

12

which permits a bay to be closed is the fact that it is

13

an area that is surrounded by land, it is closely

14

related to that land, and the reason it can be closed

off is because by closing it off you are not interfering

MR. CLAIBORNE;

A historic bay is one that

does net require a headland that is mainland rather than

No doubt because that area looks like and is
