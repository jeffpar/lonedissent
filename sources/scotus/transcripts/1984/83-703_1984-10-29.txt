tc the denial of Section 2.206 requests had to be

3

reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard first in

the District Court with the decision of these courts in

5

This system of judicial review devised by the

6
7

Court cf Appeals in this case,

which departs from the

8

practice followed in several of the circuits, finds no

9

support in the statutory language or legislative

10

history, and advances no identifiable interest tc tie

If the Court cf Appeals believed that the word

"proceeding*' generally applies only to formal agency

action, it plainly was mistaken.

MR. FOTHFELD ;

Absolutely.

The argument that

20

that,

21

and that on remand is the type cf issue that respondent

22

is free to argue with. The Commission abused its

MR. ROTHFELD:

Technically, I think that would

13

be a proceeding within

obligated itself ir Section 2.2C6 to respond in detail

16

to all the factual allegations or complaints presented

in letters to the agency, and to issue a formal opinion

proceeds on whatever is submitted to
