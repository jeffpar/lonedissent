MR. MURDOCK:

Well, not only our antitrust

act, Ycur Honor, but the decision, we believe, also is

19

unworkable because it assumes that when you bring --

20

when you file your first suit,

21

If I can use an example derived from the Fifth

our own experience that what starts cut as a consumer

Now, Justice Flamm's solution to this impasse

is to file two suits, a state court suit, the state

Then, if these do involve the same

some preclusive effect on the second suit, and that

means that any of the proceedings, or at least some cf

this certainly is not judicial economy.

on these claims, and unless this Court reverses the

2

Seventh Circuit’s radical claim preclusion decisicr,

3

they never will receive such a hearing.

4

The states of the Seventh Circuit have ally

5

demonstrated the strong policy objections to compelling

6

plaintiffs with both state law and exclusively federal

7

claims to bring their state law claims in federal court.

8

Indeed , the spectacle of state governments having to

9

litigate their state law claim in federal court is sc

10

objectionable that it ly itself discredits the Seventh

11

Circuit’s approach.

12

But the petitioners would emphasize in

13

addition the following three decisive points, any one of

14

which is sufficient to require the reversal of the

15

Seventh Circuit’s claim preclusion decision.

16

First, there is an overriding federal rule of

17

the nonpreclusion cf exclusively federal claims by

18

claimp preclusion as the result of previous judgments

19

when the previous tribunals lacked subject matter

20

jurisdiction over such claims.

21

Second,

as the states of the Seventh Circuit

22

have demcnstrated tc this Ccurt, Illinois'

23

preclusion rules have always recognized and applied this

24

same fundamental cculd have teen raised principle, which

Third, even if the Fourth Circuit's adoption

ME. SAWYIEEs

We helieve that just as the

16

states of the Seventh Circuit have stated, the Nash case

17

18

our position because of the material differences between

19

the Illinois antitrust statute and the Sherman Act and

the Clayton Act as well as the fact that no antitrust

action

was in fact brought In the state courts.

MR. SAWYIER:

You said that.
Unless the parties have received

6

a full and fair opportunity to litigate it in the

7

previous proceeding, then surely the initial litigation

8

of an entire claim no aspect of which could have been

9

litigated in the prior proceeding may never be

10
11

pr eclu ded.
The jurisdictional impossibility of bringing a

12

claim in the previous forum is the opposite of the full

13

and fair opportunity to litigate it which this Court

14

said in Kremer is necessary for preclusion.

15

The respondent has also been utterly unable to

16

respond to the petitioner's third point concerning the

17

materially different applicable standards of liability

18

and damages as between the Illinois antitrust acticr.s

19

that they might have brought but did not and their

action.

respondents once again to say anything in response

MR. SAWYIER;

opportunity to proceed in state court first and to

19

exercise their right to a state court forum for their

The petitioners believe that the true

unfairness is the fact

opportunity, much less a full and fair opportunity to

24

litigate the exclusively federal claim in

25

court forum, and yet the Seventh Circuit has held in its

the fundamental concept of a full and fair opportunity

Kremer, of course, laid down the general principle or

8

followed the Allen case in extending the general

principle of the full faith and credit requirement of

10

Section 1738.

11

But in Kremer this Court recognized that if

12

the parties had not had a full and fair opportunity to

13

litigate an issue in state court in the previous forum,

14

then there would be no issue preclusion, notwithstanding
