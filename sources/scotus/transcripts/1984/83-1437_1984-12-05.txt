for the $32,000.

The judge entered judgment on verdict

I believe this Court should ask

itself the

next question:

The first step in the solution to that problem is that

issue, and there is a body of law, obviously,

that is going to be measured.

QUESTION;

10

Not in this record, you don’t.

What’s the pertinent language

there?
MR. PETERSON:

12

The pertinent language there

13

is:

"fcr a sum," -- that is an adjective phrase, if I

14

recall my grammar in grade school -- "a sum, including

15

costs now accrued and attorney's fees," -- those are the

16

two things that are within the comma -- "of $100,000."

17

The sum is qualified by the phrase "costs new accrued

18

and attorney's fees."
It ccvers both components.

20

and I

think a successful attempt,

provision of the rule.

I could — I believe what I

could do, Justice White, is make the offer without
