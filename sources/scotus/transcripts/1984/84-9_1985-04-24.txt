ME.

NOLAN;

Thank you.

Nr. Chief Justice, and

may it please the Court:
In presenting the reargument for Petitioner
this afternoon, I would like to review briefly the facts

10

and the law, to take some time to comment on those

11

issues which were of interest to the Court on the

12

argument of this case, and to comment briefly on the

13

Lewick case which the Court decided last week and its

14

relevance to this case.

15

This case presents two very important issues;

16

the first, whether punitive damages are available under

17

EFISA; and the second, whether consequential damages in

18

this instance, including damages for emotional and

19

mental distress, are available under ERISA.

20

The district court, going with the great

21

weight of authority, held that they were not.

4

Basically, the difference between 502(a)(2),

5

the section at issue here, which provides for relief

6

there are no individual rights to recovery under 40S.

not available, but no other relief is available either.

MR.

NOLAN;

There is a reference or maybe a

10

couple to "make whole" in the legislative history.

11

Those references refer to the plan, as distinguished

12

from the beneficiary, and I think that the legislative

13

history on this is absolutely conclusive.

read the legislative history of Section 409 without

15

concluding that Congress intended to limit recovery to

Congress tied relief under 409

pretty closely to equitable principles of trusts.

which is what we’re talking about here, have all been

generally held by courts to be equitable and therefore a

reference to "legal" anyplace in the statute or anyplace

because ERISA

equitable relief, in that order.

I believe it deals with delinquent contributions, but it

2

of trusts that if money was to be awarded it was not as

3

damages, but tc compensate for something which should

4

have been done initially?
That is, the failure of the trustee to pay

5

6

payments due, when the decision went against the

7

trustee, was that in terms of damages or merely giving

8

the beneficiary what he or she had always been entitled

9

to?
MR.

10

NOLAN*

It was not, Chief Justice, in

11

terms of damages.

12

in terms of restoring to the trust that which it had

13

lost.

14

And

It was always or substantially always

the trust law also, with regard to the

15

equitable or legal issue that we're talking about, is

16

significant again, because Congress net only consigned

17

ERISA to be interpreted through equitable principles of

18

trust law, but Congress essentially codified -- and it's

19

acknowledged that it did throughout the legislative

20

history -- codified the trust law of fiduciary breach in

21

Section 409.

22

And

that law, of course, provided only for

23

equitable and. not legal relief, and there just isn't any

24

place for punitive or compensatory or consequential

25

damages under equitable relief.

15

importance as far as this case is concerned, the

expressly provided for by statute, requiring regulation

2

by the Secretary of Labor, providing in the statute

3

itself for full and fair review of any denial of an

4

employee benefit claim.

5

And that is where we would suggest that ycur

6

decision last week in the Lewick case is relevant.

7

Lewick of course was a preemption case, but it started

8

out as a suit for damages, for punitive and compensatory

9

damages for the alleged breach of a duty of good faith

10

and fair dealing in connection with an employee

disability claim.

12

Now,

This Court pointed cut in the lewick case the

advantage and

labor management relations, and it is of course no less

15

important in the employee benefit area.

16

suggest that the real relevance of the lewick case to

17

this case is i r. the Court’s comments about the

18

arbitration process and the central role that

19

arbitration plays in labor management relations, and

20

that that is analogous to the central role that the

21

statutory claim procedure plays here, because to hold

22

that damages were available under ERISA would undercut

and bypass the statutory claims procedure to the extent

that it would effectively become a dead letter.

NOLAN;

Court suits under (a)(1) or (a)(3)

9

that is actually the key question.

If damages were

10

available by suit under 502(a)(2) and 409 and were not

11

available in the claims procedure, the claims procedure

12

would not be an adequate remedy that would have to be

13

exhausted before going to court.

14

So the suit could be filed, not after the

15

claims procedure had been completed and exhausted, but

16

it could be filed at any point along the way or even

17

before the claims procedure would start.

QUESTIONS

So in

My understanding of the common law

6

going back to the eighteenth century is that punitive

damages were allowed in cases where compensatory damages

8

could not be proved, in libel cases for example.

9

your client has received compensatory damages under the

Put

Act, and you're asking not only for extra-contractual

11

damages but for punitive damages as well, and punitive
\

12

damages are wanted, I would suggest, on a totally

st3ndardless basis, unlike the criminal law which

for punitive damages in some situations.

There are statutory provisions

And my suggestion is that there’s grave doubt

about the constitutionlity of punitive damages in a case

like this.
MR.

18

BAKER:

If in fact there is an individual

Wade, the standard in the Smith versus Wade case was

whether or not a reckless standard would impose punitive

If I could respond to an earlier question of
