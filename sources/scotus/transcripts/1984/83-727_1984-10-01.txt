Hr. Attorney, General,

and application of Section 504 of the Behahilitation Act

10

of

1973, which

prohibits discrimination against the

11

handicapped in federally funded programs.

12

whether the Tennessee Medicaid program discriminated

13

against the handicapped by reducing the number of

14

inpatient hospital days provided each Medicaid recipient

15

in a fiscal year from 20 until 14.

At issue is

The district court ruled that the change did

16
17

not violate Section

50t.

A three-judge panel of the

18

Sixth Circuit in a split decision found a prima facie

19

violation of Section 504, reversed and remanded in order

20

to allow the state

to rebut the prima facie case.

21

The change which the Tennessee Medicaid

22

program took in this case was an across-the-board

deduction in inpatient hospital days from

that Title VI only prohibits intentional discrimination.

11

in this case, why that version of this theory is really

quite radically wrong.

14

the validity of the 14-day rule, or about the validity

15

of a reduction from 20 to 14 days.

And for that purpose I’ll start
