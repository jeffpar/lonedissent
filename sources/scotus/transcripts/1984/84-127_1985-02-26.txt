ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE E. WALSH, ESQ.

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. WALSH:

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

10

We are here on certiorari to review a judgment

11

of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

12

It reversed an order disqualifying two Los Angeles lawyers

13

for misconduct.

14

The first lawyer, Mr. Butler, was disqualified

15

on a finding that after a pre-trial — after a series of

16

pre-trial orders holding certain material inadmissible because

17

of its unfair, prejudicial nature, and after the venire

18

for the jury with which this case was going to be tried

19

had reported to the courthouse, he released this material,

20

this very material and nothing else, to a single correspondent

21

for publication in Washington's leading newspaper.

22

The District Court found that he did this with

23

an intent to circumvent its orders and to prejudice the

24

Defendant.

25

Allis was disqualified on a finding that he
3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

procured a statement from a crucial witness into an investi­

2

gation of fraud on the court with an intent to thwart that

3

investigation.
These findings were coupled by a third principal

4
5

finding of the District Court; that the removal of these

6

two lawyers would not leave the Plaintiffs unrepresentative

7

or ineffectively represented.

8

lawyers are leaders in the Bendectin litigation and thy

9

third is Mr. Jacob Stein, a former president of the Bar

Two of the remaining six

10

Association of this District and a bar leader by any

11

definition who lead the Washington back-up team for these

12

Plaintiffs.
One further point before I come to the question

13
14

of appealability and that is that the removal of these lawyers

15

occurred not during the trial but at a pre-trial phase where

16

there would have been any adjustment necessary to permit

17

the remaining counsel to absorb the full load of the case.
We would like first to go to the question of

18
19

appealability.

20

Court of Appeals, Flanagan against the United States had

21

not been decided by this Court.

22

and it held that disqualification of counsel orders in

23

criminal cases are not appealable prior to final judgment.

It was decided a year ago

There are two halves to the opinion as it was

24
25

At the time the appeal was taken to the

written.

The first half sets out very strongly the urgency
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

in criminal cases, but the second half measures disqualifica­

2

tion orders against the standards of Cohen and Coopers and

3

Lybrand and concludes that by their nature they cannot

4

qualify with the second and third tests of the trilogy

5

established by those two cases.

6

Without going to the question of whether a

7

disqualification order is conclusive assuming that it is

8

for the purpose of this case as the Court did in Flanagan.

9

It leaves the question is the order entirely separate from

10

the underlying case or not and this Court held that if a

11

showing of prejudice in addition to error is needed.

12

is not entirely separate because the prejudice would require

13

and examination of the trial record.

14

On the other hand, if an order is reversible without

15

a showing of prejudice the third test is not

16

is effectively reviewable after judgment.

17

It

met

and it

So, it seemed as soon as this came down that the

18

logic projected into civil cases as well as criminal and

19

a special brief was filed to point that out to the Court

20

of Appeals.

21

attempted to distinguish this Court's holding in Flanagan

22

and suggest a different rule for civil cases.

It, however, disagreed with our position and

23

Its first point — Incidentally, its discussion

24

of this begins on 20A of the Appendix to the Petition and

25

the distinction begins on 29A.
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Its first point was that if in a civil case as

2

distinguished from a criminal case to reverse a judgment

3

it would be necessary to show that the error was prejudicial

4

and that to show prejudice after trial in a civil case would

5

be extremely difficult and would, according to the Court,

6

would resolve itself into competing speculations as to whether

7

Lawyer No. 1 would have tried the case differently from

8

Lawyer No. 2.

9

In doing this it went back to holdings of Courts

10

of Appeals prior to Flanagan and it in attempting to show

11

why it would be more difficult to reach a decision as to

12

prejudice after final judgment in a civil case rather than

13

a criminal case.

14

is experience with minimum standards of effective repre­

15

sentation and that that type of -- that same question had

16

not been coming up in civil cases.

17

that was so esoteric that the learning in the criminal side

18

couldn't be adapted to the civil side.

19

It suggested that in criminal cases there

It did not explain why

And, we respectfully suggest that it exaggerates

20

the difficulty of reviewing for prejudice after judgment,

21

that it would not turn on a speculative, retrospective

22

comparison, it would turn on whether the Plaintiffs were

23

able to get lawyers of a comparable standing with those

24

they lost.

25

The holdings of this Court prior to Flanagan have
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

clear that effectively unreviewable doesn't mean just

2

reviewable with difficulty.

3

That wsa a holding in Firestone and in the Coopers and Lybrand

4

where they contention was a denial of class action treatment

5

will make it financially impossible to go ahead with the

6

case.

7

effectively reviewable and that the problems of financing

8

the case would not be accepted as a substitute for meeting

9

the Cohen trilogy.

10

It means truly unreviewable.

The Court said, notwithstanding that, it was

And, finally, it is very hard to show a difference

11

between criminal and civil cases except for this one added

12

experience that have been had in criminal cases reviewing

13

minimum effective standards, minimum standards for effective

14

representation.

15

17

QUESTION:

Well, how do the Courts of Appeals

stack up on this other than in this case?
MR. WALSH:

The Courts of Appeals prior to Flanagan

18

followed the Fifth Circuit in Duncan against Merrill Lynch

19

and all said —

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WALSH:

They said that was appealable.
They said it was appealable because

22

of the difficulty of showing prejudice after the appeal.

23

But, after Flanagan, the Fifth Circuit rejected its old

24

view of Duncan and said that Flanagan had changed that and

25

it was convinced that there was no difference between civil

(202) 628-9300

1

and criminal and it refused to follow the decision of the

2

Court itself.

3
4

QUESTION:

The Circuit just didn't lie down and

say Flanagan, they thought Flanagan was right or wrong?
MR. WALSH:

5

I don't know whether they went to

6

right or wrong but they — Judge Albert Rubin said it should

7

be followed and said that inasmuch as this Court has looked

8

at orders denying disqualification in criminal cases and

9

orders granting disqualification in criminal cases and orders

10

denying disqualification in civil cases that it would be

11

anomalous to say that this should be a different rule for

12

an order granting disqualification.

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. WALSH:

How about your old Circuit?
The Second Circuit -- The first case

15

that came up they said this raises a question that may

16

require re-evaluation of our earlier holding.

17

case said we are going to stay by our holding until the

18

Supreme Court tells us differently.

19

tion of the merits.

20

QUESTION:

So, the Second agrees with this case?

21

MR. WALSH:

It agrees only in the sense that it

The second

There was no considera­

24

was right.

QUESTION:

It did not itself by any

MR. WALSH:

2

QUESTION:

3

MR. WALSH:

4

QUESTION:

And it preceeded Roller.
Mr. Walsh —
Yes.
— I guess you agree that it is difficult

5

to establish or examine the question of prejudice after

6

the fact, after judgment.
MR. WALSH:

7

With great respect, Justice O'Connor,

8

it is a problem that comes with many kinds of error besides

9

this.

There is a certain element of speculation as to whether

10

any error is prejudicial or not.

11

but it is -- So, there is a

12

insurmountable problem.
QUESTION:

13

Some may be very glaring,

problem but it is not an

Well, suppose we were to agree with

14

you that an interlocutory appeal is not proper, but then

15

you get to the end of the line and you have this issue setting

16

there.

17

at that time so that the burden is really on the side that

18

tries the disqualification in effect?

19

What about the propriety of a presumption of prejudice

MR. WALSH:

That could be a feasible -- certainly

20

a rational position to reach.

21

and the Court below actually seems to be saying that,

22

because of the --

23

QUESTION:

If it goes in that direction,

I wanted to ask you that.

Did the

24

Court of Appeals in your view, even at the interlocutory

25

stage, apply a presumption of prejudice?
9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. WALSH:

What it seemed to say -- What it says

2

actually -- I refer to the paragraph beginning at the bottom

3

of the 31A.

4

at the trial to see whether error was committed here.

5

our judgment, the error is clear and then because of the

6

difficulty of proving prejudice it seems to say we don't

7

have to prove it, but then that, of course, brings in into

8

the other arm of the dichotomy of Flanagan; that if prejudice

9

need not be proven -- Excuse me, I misspoke.

What it said was that we don't need to look
In

If prejudice

10

need not be proven, then, of course, it is effectively

11

reviewable after final judgment and there is no excuse for

12

interrupting the District Court —

13
14

QUESTION:

That would just go to whether an

interlocutory appeal is proper.

15

MR. WALSH:

16

And, one more point on that.

Yes, Justice O'Connor.
In Coopers against

17

Lybrand, the proposal was made that there be a factual

18

evaluation of the burdens.

19

would be an indiscriminate standard for appealability; that

20

appealability couldn't turn on such fact finding.

21

And, this Court held that that

And, the Court below will get into that same box

22

if it tries to suggest that the clarity of error is going

23

to be a factor in determining appealability, that first

24

you must see the error clear or do I need further help

25

before deciding whether a case is appealable before judgment.
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

And, the same concept, if adopted, just as in

1

2

Coopers and Lybrand, would spread to other types of pre-trial

3

orders as well as this one.

4

If there are no further questions on appealability,

5

I will go briefly to the merits and just say that what

6

happened here is that notwithstanding Pullman and Swint

7

and other cases the Court of Appeals, as it says, felt that

8

the findings below were not sufficiently extensive or

9

explicit and it took the record and went through and made

10

the findings it would have found if it were trying the case

11

de novo.

12

13

QUESTION:

Did it hold that any of the findings

were clearly erroneous?

14

MR. WALSH:

It did not, Justice Rehnquist, it

15

did not.

16

record support for the finding of the District Court.

17

It never addressed the question of was there a

The critical findings as to Allis was one of intent.

18

Did he do what he did with an intent to thwart an investiga­

19

tion?

20

the time he did what he did and his credibility as a witness.

21

And, it is perfectly clear the District Court rejected him

22

as a witness.

23

the conduct of a true investigation, was not his purpose

24

and it had support for it because there were other witnesses.

25

All of these were hostile witnesses to the Defendant, but

This turned on credibility and on his knowledge at

It found his explanation for what he did,

11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

there were other witnesses who testified that, indeed, they

2

did have knowledge, that Mr. Allis' partner, Mr. Butler,

3

called people on that day and gave them the message that

4

Allis professes not to have had knowledge of.
QUESTION:

5

6

a moment?

7

MR. WALSH:

8

QUESTION:

9

Mr. Walsh, could I interrupt you for

Yes.
Because in addition to the factual

problem of this kind of a factual case, I was not entirely

10

clear as to the legal standards that the district judge

11

applied.

12

proceeding and during discovery somebody tries to frustrate

13

his opponent's efforts to get full discovery it is

14

disqualification?

15

What is it?

MR. WALSH:

Is it any time in an adversary

Not his opponent's.

I think there

16

is a misconception in the Court of Appeals that Ms. Janowski,

17

the witness involved, was a witness for the Defendant.

18

She wasn't.

19

her and leave her available for the Court, so it is the

20

Court's witness whose future is being thwarted here.

21

The Defendant tried to insulate itself from

And, it is not a suggestion that any time a witness

22

is impeached -- It is a mistake.

23

stances the Court concluded that the only rationalization

24

for what he did so quickly and in the form of the statement

25

took which was contrived that he had an intent to thwart

But, on all the circum­

the investigation.
QUESTION:

2
3

Is there any precedent for disqualifying

a lawyer for that reason?
MR. WALSH:

4

Well, to the extent that this is

5

obstruction of justice there are precedents and they are

6

in a footnote in our brief.

7

They are more dramatic types of obstruction like getting

8

a witness to leave town and things like that.

9

the same -QUESTION:

10
11

of the lawyer.

But, it is

And the remedy was disqualification

I can understand it as --

12

MR. WALSH:

13

QUESTION:

14

like that.

15

of interest.

16

as far as I see.

17

There are four or five of them.

Disqualification, yes.
— a disciplinary matter or something

Normally our disqualification cases are conflict
It is a little bit of an unusual situation

MR. WALSH:

It started about 40 years ago with

18

about a 100-year history in conflicts and a 40-year history

19

of discreet acts of misconduct.

20

QUESTION:

21

MR. WALSH:

I see.
Usually it has been used with discreet

22

acts of misconduct whether our co-counsel and whether out-

23

of-town lawyers where the forum only has one contact with

24

the lawyer in question and, therefore, less of a reason

25

for suggesting going to the Bar Association or something
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

like that.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Walsh, I am somewhat loathed to

3

ask you this question, but I think it is bound to be in

4

the back of one's mind.

5

Mr. Allis and Ms. Janowski and some of the attorneys in

6

your group a fairly common incident of the litigation practice

7

nowadays?
MR. WALSH:

8
9

Rehnquist.

Is this sort of brouhaha between

I wouldn't think that, Justice

Your Honor, the burden of proof --

10

QUESTION:

11

(Laughter)

12

MR. WALSH:

If it is, I am glad I went on the Bench.

Well, I won't say it has gotten any

13

better, but this was unusual.

14

happened to any of us before.

15

QUESTION:

16

MR. WALSH:

I don't think this had ever

By that you mean both sides?
I don't know about the other side,

17

but I think that they also were reacting to an unusual

18

situation, but the question was where one side tried to

19

preserve the witness involiate for the Court, the other

20

one was trying to destroy the usefulness of her testimony.

21

QUESTION:

One other question going to the legal

22

rules, do you think it is clear that a different standard

23

should apply to out-of-town counsel and a regular member

24

of the Bar?

25

MR. WALSH:

We don't urge that.
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION:

2

MR. WALSH:

You don't?
As to the standard of misconduct we

3

suggest it is best to keep that the same.

4

unusual situations I haven't seen, but the standard for

5

misconduct should be the same.

6

turn on the relationship between the forum and the lawyer.

7

A lawyer who is here for one case only is dealt with by

8

taking him out of that case.

9

QUESTION:

There may be

The sanction may very well

In terms of a remedy for misconduct,

10

would you say that it would not be appropriate to disqualify

11

a lawyer unless it were also appropriate to impose some

12

kind of discipline?

13
14
15
16
17

MR. WALSH:

Yes, even in a conflict case.

If

the lawyer resisted, there would be some -QUESTION:

And, in this case did the judge refer

the matter to anybody for disciplinary purposes?
MR. WALSH:

It did not.

It did not.

And, again,

18

this goes, I think, to the transient relationship between

19

the lawyer and the court and the case.

20

Coming to Butler, the Court below did not disturb

21

the finding as to intent.

That stands.

Nor did it really

22

reach the question of misconduct.

23

all of these things were so, that there was not a sufficient

24

effect upon the underlying case to justify disqualification

25

and that that should be restricted to truly egregious conduct.

It held that even if

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Now, in holding that Mr. Butler's conduct was

2

not truly egregious, the Court looked not to what he did

3

but to the article as it was published and suggested that

4

this was, indeed, a balanced article.

5

upon a definition.

6

very weak case and make them look equal, I suppose you could

7

say that is balanced.

8

tugging part of that story was pro-plaintiff and anti-defendan

9

And the worst part of the story the Court of Appeals didn't

Well, balance depends

If you take a very strong case and a

But, all of the emotional, heart-

10

even recognize which was the attribution to the Defendant

11

of responsibility for Thalidomide which crippled thousands

12

of children in Europe where it was sold by German and English

13

pharmaceutical companies.

14

Now, the Defendant is touched by Thalidomide because

15

it had licensed it and was testing it for introduction into

16

this country.

17

discovered was testing immediately stopped and -- but there

18

were some cases that arose from the testing program which

19

were settled.

20

misfortunes of having children with birth defects claimed

21

to have taken Thalidomide and those cases were tried out.

22

At the time its teratogenicity was

There other cases where people with

Now, Mr. Butler tried one of those cases and won

23

it and in the middle of this story is this discussion of

24

how he won a case for a legless child against the Defendant

25

who had sold Thalidomide.
16
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Now, it is not only a devastating reminder of

1

2

a 20-year old tragedy, but it is a -- Thalidomide is going

3

to be a source of daily discussion in the trial because

4

Thalidomide is the classic teratogen against all other

5

claims -- of which all other claims of teratogenicity are

6

measured.

7

So, it is not as though it is going to be a for­

8

gotten thing.

And a juror who has read the story, even

9

though he has momentarily forgotten it, this is all going

10

to come back as this horror of Thalidomide is reiterated

11

on an almost daily basis.

12

For those reasons, Your Honor, we -- It was really

13

the Butler thing that impelled our petition for certiorari,

14

that the message could go out to the profession that it

15

is not sufficiently egrecious to do this sort of thing;

16

that if you don't get your evidence in legitimately you

17

can use a newspaper correspondent to do it with you.

18
19

I would like to reserve the rest of my time for
rebuttal if I may.

more clearly the posture in which this case is here and

2

more precisely how it got through the two lower courts.

3

The District Court proceeded on a set of assumptions

4

about how it could decide the disqualification issue which

5

no one defends in this Court.

6

The District Court proceeded on the assumption

7

that because these lawyers had been admitted pro hac vice

8

they could be disqualified on grounds less substantial than

9

those that would be applicable to regularly admitted counsel.

10

The Court expressly said that in its opinion.

11

Court said further that precisely because of that reason

12

she was not going to go on to determine whether these lawyers

13

had engaged in any definable act of misconduct, any violation

14

of disciplinary rules; that it was sufficient in her view

15

if their conduct was "impermissible in the view of the Court."

16

So, that was the standard by which these lawyers were judged.

17

Was it impermissible in the view of the Court?

QUESTION:

And, the

Do you suggest that that judge did

not taken into account prevailing standards of the profession?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, Your Honor, the Court expressi

21

said that she was not making the assessment of whether these

22

counsel had violated the prevailing standards.

23

during the hearing, for example, she said to Mr. Allis while

24

he was on the witness stand -- this is page 166 of the Joint

25

Appendix -- I will not decide whether Mr. Allis violated

At one point

any canon of conduct.
So, we had sort of a standard list determination

2
3

that in the view of this judge this was impermissible and

4

that that is all it took because these lawyers were from

5

out of town.
Now, the Court of Appeals reviewed that and said

6
7

that is wrong as a matter of the local rules.

The local

8

rules are quite clear that once an out-of-town counsel is

9

admitted for the purpose of a case, that counsel is to be

10

judged by the identical standards that are applicable to

11

regularly admitted counsel.

12

and explained that that was the applicable situation.

The Court quoted from the rules

The Court then went on to say what he understood

13
14

to be required before lawyers could be disqualified in a

15

case.

16

they said, there must be a definable act of misconduct,

17

there must be a violation of the standard of conduct under

18

the disciplinary rules or of some rule of court or, indeed,

19

of some implicit powers that the court has to control its

20

own courtroom.

21

and can exercise a contempt power over them.

It said, look, the question here is, first of all,

It is understood that the courts have those

But, there must be one of those things before

a court can disqualify lawyers because, after all, what

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

to do so.

Disqualification is vitiation of that contract

2

to the substantial injury of both parties to that contract.

3

It was particularly aggravated in this case because these

4

lawyers had invested literally 6,000 hours in the preparation

5

of this case for trial and it was due to go to trial imminently

6

and their disqualification meant that people were going

7

to have to start over.

8

But, the Court said at a minimum to justify —

QUESTION:

10

11

I thought there were something like

eight lawyers representing the client.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

There are eight lawyers who have

12

entered appearances in this case, Your Honor.

13

them, including Mr. Stein, entered appearances solely to

14

represent the lawyers in the disqualification proceeding

15

when it was undertaken.

16
17
18

QUESTION:

Several of

Two others --

How many lawyers were representing

the client otherwise?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, what the record clearly

19

shows, and this is not contradicted, is that in terms of

20

preparation of the case on the merits for trial Mr. Butler

21

and Mr. Allis were regarded as the principal trial counsel.

22

They had done the yeoman's work -- They had done almost

23

all the major preparation.

24

work in preparation for being back-ups, assistants to Mr.

25

Butler and Mr. Allis.

Two other lawyers had done some

20
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

But, it is not disputable that they were the two

2

lawyers who were gearing up to try this case.

3

lawyers, this number that accumulates to eight, are lawyers

4

who were not participating actively in the present preparation

5

of this case on the merit.

6
7

8
9

The other

In any event, the Court of Appeals said we must
have a definable act of misconduct.
Secondly, the Court of Appeals said not every
definable act of misconduct should produce a disqualification.

10

There are ways to punish misconduct.

11

sanctions that the Bar can impose and there are sanctions

12

that the Court can impose through its contempt power.

13

There are obviously

Disqualification, unlike those punitive sanctions,

14

has the very unpleasant side effect that it deprives the

15

client of the lawyer of his choice and can do so in a way

16

that will be very injurious, which I want to get into at

17

some length.

18

So, said the Court, we agree with the Second Circuit

19

rule in Nyquist which has now been rather generally embraced

20

by the commentators and by several courts of appeals, that

21,

where disqualification is contemplated, its purpose is not

22

punishment of the lawyers, punish the lawyers other ways.

23

The function of disqualification is to assure that lawyers

24

will not, by remaining in the case, imperil the integrity

25

of the trial.

How much other options does a court

have when you are dealing with people admitted pro hac vice?

3

Where do the lawyers here practice, in California?

4

MR. GOTTESMAN:

5

QUESTION:

6

California, that is right.

That the District Court should refer

the matter to the California Bar for discipline?

7

MR. GOTTESMAN:

The District Court -- If these

8

people had done a wrong, and they had not, but if they done

9

a wrong, the District Court would have had the power of

10

contempt over them.

11

QUESTION:

If the District Court excerised the

12

power of contempt -- I have seen enough cases come up here --

13

then the yelling that, no, they should have just disqualified

them.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

15
16

No, we wouldn't be yelling that

at all.

17

QUESTION:

18

MR. GOTTESMAN:

It is a second guessing operation.
Well, there is a difference, Your

19

Honor, and this is what all the courts have said, you have

20

to decide what is the purpose of the disqualification?

21

Disqualification is not a form of punishment.

22

brief is emphatic about that in this Court.

23

contending that disqualification is a form of punishment.

What we are saying is disqualification is a
prophylactic.

It is a means to assure that there will not

be further conduct that imperils the trial.
QUESTION:

2

So, if it were perfectly outrageous

3

conduct on the part of an attorney at one stage of the case,

4

and yet he was obviously totally penitent and said I won't

5

do it again, the District Court would be obligated not to

disqualify him, even though he would have violated 15 canons

7

at the time he committed the outrageous conduct.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

If the District Court could not

imperil the integrity of the trial, that is correct, Your

of disqualification?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

It is now -- It started with the

5

for that.

6

in efforts to disqualify which don't relate

MR. GOTTESMAN:

But, when you are dealing with

Well, the question of whether

7

gamesmanship was at work here, Your Honor, is one that I

8

want to get to because it goes to the whole appealability

9

issue and the need for an interlocutory appeal.

But, even

10

if one were to say that they were not going to require the

11

second element and we firmly believe the second element

12

is correct, that disqualification is not a means of punish­

13

ing unless one wants to punish the client and there are

14

other ways to punish the lawyer.

15

16
17

QUESTION:
"deterrence."

You haven't mentioned the word

Because there are punitive sanctions

that can be used against lawyers who misbehave, there are

deterrents.

20

client, not only of the lawyer, and that is why the principle

21

has developed that disqualification should not be used simply

because there was misconduct by a lawyer, because the

23

implications for the clients are severe.

25

Disqualification is punishment largely of the

1

But I do want to say just a minute what the Court of Appeals

2

said about Allis and Butler and why it was not prepared

3

to tolerate their disqualification in this case.

4

I have indicated the District Court decision can't

5

stand.

Nobody is defending the approach by which the District

6

Court decided this case.

No one is defending it here.

But, Petitioner asked the Court of Appeals as

7

8

a first proposition to decide this case under the Rights

9

Standard.

They say you decide whether Allis and Butler

10

engaged in an act of misconduct and you decide whether the

11

District Court's result could be justified by the application

12

of the proper principle.
And, the Court of Appeals said, well, obviously

13
14

we can't do that if it turns on disputed issues that the

15

District Court didn't decide, but on this record there are

16

no disputed issues that are necessary for us to recognize

17

that, number one, Mr. Allis committed no act of misconduct,

18

no conceivable act of misconduct.

19

secretary came to him one day and made a statement to him

20

that the other side was trying to extract a false statement

21

from her with promises of money.

22

she did receive substantial sums from the other side after

23

that.

24

truth is that your client's case is genuine and she has

25

never said anything to me to the contrary.

What did he do?

Well, the concurring opinion raised

That would depend, first of all, on whether

10

the Petitioners were going to call Ms. Janowski at trial.

11

When that question was asked of them, they said that in

12

light of subsequent evidences that one might call of an

13

impeaching nature about Ms. Janowski's character they were

14

not at all certain they were going to call Ms. Janowski

15

at trial.

her, then Mr. Allis would not possibly be a witness.

And, of course, if they were not going to call

QUESTION:

Well, in any event, it wasn't decided

so he was a potential witness at trial, I guess.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Well, at some point the Petitioner

20

was going to have to announce a final decision on that point.

21

If the announcement that she was going to be a witness,

22

then the question, Your Honor, would have to be addressed.

23

In this case, the standard is that he must withdraw at that

24

point if it is obvious that he should be a witness.

25

QUESTION:

Do you think an order of disqualification

because someone is a prospective witness is immediately

2

appealable?

3

MR. GOTTESMAN:

That uniquely may not meet the

4

second of the three factors because then the question of

5

whether that judgment is correct, that is to say whether

6

the lawyer truly was needed as a witness, can't be made

7

until the trial.

So, as the Sixth Circuit said, this is the one
area where we can recognize that in a civil case a disqualifi­

13

Do you think that was correct in the

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I think there is a respectable

argument to be made for that position.

15

jeopardizes our position on appealability.

16

It in no way

But, the thing I want to emphasize is that Mr.

17

Allis did absolutely nothing wrong.

18

the District Court found that he was desiring to thwart

19

an investigation is not an accurate reflection of what the

20

District Court found.

21

as to Allis' intent is that he wanted to get a written ,

22

sworn statement from his secretary retracting what she had

23

told the other side and that is correct, because, after

24

all, she had told him what was told to the other side was

25

false.

The assertion that

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

And, he asked, are you willing to put that -- what you have

2

just told me in a sworn statement and she said yes.
So, the District Court found he had the intent

3
4

to take a statement from his secretary retracting what she

5

had told the other side.
Then the District Court announced what were a

6
7

series of legal propositions.

He had a duty not to do that.

8

Allis has the duty to investigate whether his client is

9

committing a fraud upon the Court.

He had no such duty.

10

The Court of Appeals convincingly demonstrates that he had

11

no such duty.

12

was engaged in a fraud.

13

porting the good faith of his client and his own secretary

14

was telling him things that supported it.

This is not a case where he knew his client
He had overwhelming evidence sup­

The Court then said in its conclusion on page

15

16

77A, because he had this duty and because he took a

17

retraction from his secretary, that can be characterized

18

as an attempt to thwart an investigation by the Court.
So, a notion that that was his state of mind and

19

20

that is what the Court has found is not accurate.

The Court

21

found only that he took a statement from a witness believing

22

it to be true which she was telling him was true.

QUESTION:
Mr. Butler's conduct?

6

Are you at some point going to discuss

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I would like to, Your Honor, yes.

Maybe I should do it now and do appealability at the end.

7

I would be prepared to argue at length that a

8

finding is not permissible that Butler had an improper motive

9

here.

He could not conceivably have thought that what he

10

gave to Morton Mintz was going to be in the hands of the

ultimate jury.

On the same day that the Mintz article appeared in the

QUESTION:

Did the District Court credit his version

of his motive?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

No, the District Court did not.

What I am suggesting is the District Court's rejection of

his motive based on nothing but her disbelief in an affidavit

11

that he filed is not sustainable on whatever standard of

12

review may be applicable here given that this is a First

14

It should be noted that —

MR. GOTTESMAN:

Why is it a First Amendment case?
Because the question of whether

MR. GOTTESMAN:

I am saying that if that evidence

is relevant to a paramount public issue which far transcends

5

this lawsuit as the safety of Bendectin does and -- this

6

is very important.

7

whenever evidence is ruled inadmissible, chuck it to the

8

newspapers, by no means, but when that evidence is relevant

9

to issues that far transcend that lawsuit as this does and

I don't mean to say lawyers can just,

10

when there is no substantial and imminent danger that it

11

is going to reach the jury in the case, then, yes, indeed,

12

that is protected by the First Amendment.

13

You would apply that to say a prosecutor

Well, in the context of a highly

visible trial where the whole community is reading the paper

about that and in this case where a jury hasn't been sworn

Then you can say with respect to any

QUESTION:

1

But that didn't prevent the court from

2

finding an order of disqualification of counsel was not

3

immediately appealable?
MR. GOTTESMAN:

4
5

It did not and I want to explain

why that doesn't apply here.
First, the coinfactors developed in civil cases

6
7

and what the court said is there are always weights on the

8

scale against an interlocutory appeal, heavy weights.

9

then over the years certain exceptions developed and the

But

10

Court was able to identify that.

When these three factors

11

are present, they outweigh the interest against an inter­

12

locutory appeal in a civil case.
Then the criminal cases came and as Flanagan

13
14

succinctly demonstrates the weights against an interlocutory

15

appeal are much, much heavier in a criminal case.
So, the same factors that would tip the scale

16
17

in a civil case aren't sufficient to tip it in a criminal

18

case.

19

been very few instances where this Court has been able to

20

find that that was so.

You need a lot, lot more and, indeed, there have

21

The second thing that is different -- and this

22

is key I think to this appealability case -- and that is

23

that there is no effective review of the disqualification

24

of counsel after judgment is entered.

25

The most persuasvie demonstration of that appears

1

in the Ninth Circuit's decision in Gough versus Perkowski

2

and since I won't have time to lay it all out I strongly

3

urge the Court to read that before deciding.

4

As they point out, what would the issue be on

5

appeal?

The issue would be whether the disqualified lawyer

6

would have gotten a better result for the client than the

7

lawyer who actually tried the case.

8

other prejudice finding courts make.

That is not like any

Ordinarily, if the issue is whether a piece of

9
10

evidence was improperly admitted, the court can look at

11

the record that was actually made, it can compare it to

12

the record as it would have been, and it can — it is not

13

easy, but it can determine what that difference is.

14

in this area, it is comparing a record that was actually

15

made to a total unknown.

16

other lawyer tried the case?

17

do much better jobs than others.

18

19

20

But,

What would have happened if the
Lawyers are fungible.

How would that lawyer

What tactical differences would have

It is impossible to make that assessment.

What

21

the courts of appeals have uniformly said -- not a one has

22

ever deviated from this -- we are not competent to measure

23

prejudice after a judgment when a lawyer has been disquali­

24

fied.

25

We can't do it.
The Ninth Circuit considered how could we go about

How could we get the other record to compare
Well, they said we could have a

The purpose of this is to show that it should have

10

So now the client is off to hire a third lawyer to make

11

this post-judgment thing.

12

Now the lawyers come in and they say with the

13

benefit of hindsight, to be sure, we would have tried this

14

case in an entirely different way.

15

jury arguers, we are much more articulate in the way we

16

present it, we would have called three experts, they didn't.

17

We would have done, this, that, and the other.

We have much more effective

22

things.

QUESTION:

It is unlike —

What if the Court would apply, as I

3

think the Court of Appeals did here, a presumption of pre­

4

judice?

5

MR. GOTTESMAN:

The Court here implied no pre­

6

sumption, Your Honor.

7

committed because a contract freely entered into between

8

two parties was vitiated without justification and the

9

Court said that is a wrong we can correct now.

10

The Court here said a wrong was

We are not

presuming that there is going to be --

11

QUESTION:

Well, I think I read it differently.

12

But assuming there is a presumption of prejudice at the

13

end, does that affect your argument?

MR. GOTTESMAN:

MR. GOTTESMAN:

QUESTION:

19

20

Well, if the Court said there

No, just a presumption of prejudice.
I guess I don't know --

— that affects the burden of proof,

of course.
MR. GOTTESMAN:

Right.

I guess I don't know,

21

Your Honor — The reason it is hard for me to answer that

22

is that I don't know what the implications of the presumption

23

of prejudice will be.

by arguments by the other side that say, look, this is a

good lawyer, why should we think he did any less or any

Then we are back in the same

This is not in our competence

That is why anything short of an absolute rule

6

that says you reverse if this happens does not protect the

7

client against the very serious injury that a different

8

outcome may be obtained and it will never be detectable

9

after the fact by any instrument the courts of appeals can

10

use to measure that.

11

I would point out one other thing, one terrible

12

consequence of that.

13

because the courts are all saying they won't entertain it

14

and if you can't get a pre-judgment appeal, there will never

15

be the articulation of what standards should guide district

16

courts in determining whether disqualification is proper

or not.

2

who want to delay a trial, the greatest thing in the world

3

is to file a motion to disqualify.

There is an epidemic of this now.

For people

And, if the district courts are governed by any

definable standards in ruling on those motions, everybody

is going to have an incentive to do that.

There is never

How do we know, let's

Maybe we can sell this idea to this judge.

9

It is only through the development of an appellate

10

articulation of what the controlling standards are that

11

we can ever have a definition of what district courts are

12

supposed to do and yet if this Court says there are no

13

interlocutory --

14
15

QUESTION:

Of course, part of that cuts against

the Flanagan rationale.

16

MR. GOTTESMAN:

It cuts against Flanagan for a

17

very important reason.

18

to go out and try to disqualify lawyers.

19

to get their cases to trial.

20

with disqualification motions.

21

In Flanagan nobody has got a motive
Prosecutors want

They don't want to delay it

But, in civil cases we know that there is an

22

epidemic.

23

an epidemic of disqualification motions, efforts to delay

24

trials by which every party has the interest in doing so.

25

And, we need to have standards to prevent that.

Every circuit is writing about this.

There is

it is that the nature of the claim made in Flanagan was

different.

5

is subject to being taken away if disqualification is proper,

6

but it is not subject to be taken away otherwise.

7

Here is the claim is the District Court has
Sure, it

In Flanagan the claim was that the Defendant's

8

Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights were violated.

And, as

9

this Court explained very succinctly and clearly, it was

10

an element of that claim that there be a conviction under

11

improper circumstances.

12

not that the disqualification itself was improper.

13

invoking the Fifth and Sixth Amendments the claim was I

14

am not going to get a trial that is a proper trial.

The claim, in other words, was

Because that was so, the Court was able to say

16

in Flanagan the second criteria, that the issue decided

17

be completely separate from the merits, is not present here

18

since it is an element of the claim you are advancing that

19

you ultimately be convicted in a way prejudiced you.

20

In our case, the claim being made is different.

21

The claim is we had a contract.

ORAL ARGUMENT OF LAWRENCE E. WALSH, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER — REBUTTAL

7

MR. WALSH:

8

the Court:

9
10

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

Unless there are further questions, I would waive
rebuttal.

11

QUESTION:

I have one question, Mr. Walsh, that

12

is prompted by Justice O'Connor's question about the whole

13

prejudice problem.

14

MR. WALSH:

15

QUESTION:

Yes.
Based on something you said in your

16

opening argument, would you think that there would be an

17

absence of prejudice regardless of who has the burden if

18

your client could show in the subsequent proceedings here

19

that there were other counsel equally well recognized in

20

the profession as those who were disqualified who would

21

take the work -- substitute their same rate of pay and all

22

the rest.

23

Would that disprove prejudice?
MR. WALSH:

Justice Stevens, we think it would.

24

I think prejudice can't be measured over whether one question

25

more was asked in cross examination or not, but with Mr.

Stein, who incidentally is committed for the full commitment

2

to these Plaintiffs —
QUESTION:

3

But then does it not follow -- If that

4

is an adequate disproof of prejudice, you will never have

5

prejudice in any of these cases because the Bar is big enough.

6

There is always another lawyer out there.
MR. WALSH:

7

Let me give an example that occurred

8

to me, Mr. Justice, where I think there could be a problem.

9

If a person from New York with not such a good case --

10

where we have a strong, emotionally charged case like this,

11

there would be no trouble getting the best lawyers in the

12

country.

13

came to the District from New York and didn't know the Bar

14

and one thing or another and if the lawyer who came down

15

is a friend to handle the case was disqualified, then I could

16

see a problem.

17

It goes to a question raised in Mr. Justice Rehnquist's

18

concurrence in Firestone, that a court would reconsidered.

19

There is nothing that forecloses further reconsideration

20

here.

21

But, supposing it was a weak case and a person

In that kind of a case I would think --

If Mr. Stein went to the court and became a judge

22

and others went to the Department of Justice and were not

23

available, even though the district judge might have strong

24

reluctance to police Mr. Butler for a 12-week trial, I think

25

there would be a basis for reconsideration on new evidence,

but that is the example I -QUESTION:

2

It seems to me you are saying if the

3

case is so weak that you don't care who represents the

4

plaintiff, why, you would not worry about it.

I don't think that.
You could file a motion in that case.
I don't mean to minimize the case

at all.
