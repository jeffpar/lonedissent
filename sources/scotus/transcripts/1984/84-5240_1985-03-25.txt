ESQ. ,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS
MR. KURZBAN*

Mir.

Chief Justice and may it

please the Court, this is a case about invidious

10

discrimination in enforcement of the immigration laws cf

11

the United States against black Haitian refugees who

12

were seeking political asylum in the United States.

13

For over ten years, immigration enforcement

14

officials in south Florida have applied the law with an

15

unequal hand and an evil eye,

16

Wo v. Hopkins, against Haitians seekino political asylum

17

as is their right under the statutes and treaties cf the

18

United States.

19

as this Court said in Yick

Although it has occurred in a variety of

20

contexts, this case raises the issue with

21

detention and parole and discrimination in that

22

detention and parole.

23

In the spring of

1981,

respect to

approximately 1,700

24

Haitians came to the United States flee ing the

25

politically repressive conditions and

the persecution cf

Nicaraguan refugees, such as Cuban refugees, who entered

3

south Florida at the same time, under the same

circumstances, and indeed, unlike other excludable

They said

bona fide standard.

2

QUESTION:

That -The question of whether the neutral

3

standards since adopted by regulation by the government

4

were complied with and as applied kind of a compliance

5

standard, is that what you understand?

6

NR. KURZBANi

Well, again, I honestly think it

7

is unclear.

8

whether or not it was discrimination with respect to the

9

400 people, but they paid lip service to that

I think they remanded it back to determine

10

discrimination because they did it under a standard

11

which in effect is a narrow standard, appropriate in

12

other contexts such as the substantive review of a

13

decision, as Justice Blackmun found in Kleindienst

14

versus Handel, of the Attorney General.

15

But it is not clear what the ultimate outcome

16

of that review would be, and in addition they gave no

17

relief to the 1,700 class members who have been released

18

and at the same time they lifted the injunction that

19

prevented the government from reincarcerating those

20

1 ,700.

21

So those 1,700 petitioners that are still part

22

of this class are subject tc being incarcerated again,

23

and we have no reason to believe, based on the

24

continuing pattern and practice of discrimination, that

25

Haitians who have suffered in south Florida based on
5
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that continuing pattern, that these Haitians will not be

2

redetained in a discriminatory manner.

3
4

QUESTION;

I guess the difference is that when

you started the action there were no government

5

regulations in effect governing the detention and

6

parole.

7

MR.

KURZBAN;

But there was a statute, Your

8

Honor, that said -- there was a facially neutral

9

statute,

1182(d)(5), and low-level immigration officials

10

enforced that statute in a discriminatory way.

11

no reason to believe today and in fact we believe that

12

they are enforcing their present policy in the same

13

discriminatory manner, and unless this Court makes it

14

clear that the Immigration Service cannot enforce a

15

neutral statute or regulation --

16

QUESTION!

Well,

We have

do we have the cart before

17

the horse a little bit, trying to decide the

18

constitutional issue before we know whether in fact it

19

is being discrimin atorily applied?

20

wait until that is decided before going off on the

21

constitutional ground?

22

MR. KURZBAN;

Normally don't we

Well, Your Honor,

I think in

23

some circumstances that is correct, but not in this

24

circumstance, for several reasons.

25

standard offers no relief for the 1,700 petitioners, as

First, the remand

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

I said.

2

the Court of Appeals remanded the case, they remanded it

3

under a facially legitimate and bona fide standard.

Secondly, with respect to the grounds on which

4

that standard is not sufficient tc protect

5

against race and nationality discrimination, because

6

that standard, while appropriate in the context of such

7

cases as Fiallo versus Bell and in Kleindienst versus

8

Handel, where the Court paid great deference to the

9

decisions of Congress and the Attorney General, is

10

inappropriate where Congress has spoken, where the

11

President and the Attorney General have spoken,

12

where low-level officials have discriminated anyway.

13

QUESTIONS

and

Hr. Kurzhan, is it your position

14

that the government may not discriminate in

15

administering the immigration laws on the basis of

16

nationality ?

17

HR. KURZBAN;

Well, Your Honor,

I think it

18

depends on who we are talkinq about.

19

of this record, where Congress required a facially

20

neutral statute and had one under 1182(d)(5), where the

21

President and the Attorney General both made it clear

22

that it should be an even-handed policy, where Congress

23

has specifically only given the authority to the

24

President under 1182(f)

25

distinctions under classes of aliens, on the facts cf

and under

Here, on the facts

7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

this case I think that immigration officials do not have

2

the right to make that distinction based on

3

nationality .

4
5

QUESTION*

Is that because of the regulations

and the statute?

6

MR. KURZBAN;

No,

it is because this Court has

7

always recognized that race and national origin

8

discrimination are suspect --

9

QUESTIONS

We've got two separate questions, I

10

think.

11

Congress pass a statute that discriminates in the

12

administration of the immigration laws on the basis of

13

national origin, but I thought from your answer perhaps

14

it is the second one raised here,

15

President have taken the position that there will net be

16

discrimination on the basis of national origin.

17

you don't get to the constitutional issue because the

18

low-level people are bound either by the administrative

19

regulations or by the statute.

20

The first is perhaps the abstract one, can

MR. KURZBAN;

where Congress and the

I do not know that that follows,

21

Your Honor,

because on the record in this case, they

(202) 628-9300

1

Moreover, when the en banc court of the

2

Elevent Circuit has made it clear that the United States

3

Constitution is irrelevant, they said no constitutional

4

review is irrelevant to race and nationality

5

discrimination.

6

that the Constitution applies in this circumstance is

7

important.

8
9
10
11

T think that the moral force of stating

QUESTION:

We ordinarily require something

more of a controversy than just a debte about moral
f orce.
ME. KUBZBAN:

That’s correct, Your Honor, but

12

there is a very live controversy here, with the 1,700

13

people who have been released and for whom the

14

injunction has now bean lifted by the en banc court’s

15

decision, who are subjected to being redetained, and in

16

Footnote 10 of the government's brief, they indicate

17

that they may very well redetain them.

18

And this Court has also recognized that the

19

mere cessation of illegal conduct, which we believe, by

20

the way, has not occurred here -- we believe the

21

government is continuing to discriminate, as they have

22

for ten years.

23

But the mere cessation of that conduct, they

24

are getting up here today and saying, we will not

25

redetain these people based on national origin, based on

1

the history of the Service's discriminatory actions, is

2

not enough to moot this case out.

4

When the Haitians arrived in the United
States, they represented less than 7 percent of the --

Well,

it may not be -- even if it

isn't moot, it may not be ripe, the constitutional

7

issue.

these 400 people until your remand is completed.

9

You really don’t know what is going to happen to

MB. KURZBAN;

Well, Your Honor, we believe it

10

is right because we are dealing with this case from the

11

standpoint of a continuing pattern and practice of

12

discrimination.

13

-- 70 percent of the aliens who were detained are

14

Haitian.

15

believe quite strongly that the Service is engaging in

16

the same pattern and practice of discrimination.

17

We know that 70 percent of the Haitians

We have no reason to believe, and in fact,

QUESTION;

Suppose the District Court gives

18

you just what you are asking for here, even if that

19

stretches the mandate, the remand.

20

MR. KURZBAN:

Well, what we are asking for,

21

Your Honor -- maybe it hasn't been made clear.

22

are asking for is declaratory injunctive relief, stating

23

that the Immigration Service cannot use the

24

impermissible criteria of race and national origin in

25

making determinations about parole.

MR, KURZBAN:

We wouldn't issue the injunction.
Well, I think if this Court

issued a declaration and remanded it back to the en banc

18

QUESTION;

You would just have another reason

19

-- you would just have another weapon to use against

20

lawless conduct , but there is already a weapon to use

21

against it.

22

this kind of application of the law.

23

There are laws and regulations that forbid

MR. KURZBAN;

That's correct , Your Honor, but

what we have here is a continuing pattern and practice

of discrimination, despite neutral statutes.

That is

the problem.

2

1980, for example, the District Court in another case

that the Immigration Service violated the statutes that

MR. KURZBAN;

I think given the history of

discrimination here, given that continuing pattern and

practice of discrimination, that it is necessary for

5

this Court to issue a declaration making it clear that

6

under the Constitution no race and nationality

7

discrimination isbpermissible.

8
9

The record in this case indicates an
overwhelming pattern of race and nationality

10

discimination.

11

has been wholly unregarded by the government on the

record of this case except for mere protestations of

13

innocence.

the Court, I assume that it goes without saying that

2

there is no warrant to vacate the judgment of the Court

3

of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in this case.

4

It is vary clear from the record in this case

5

that simply governmental discrimination was urged fcoth

6

before the panel and also before the en banc court, and

7

it was only the shift that was made really before this

8

Court and that came out during the oral argument before

9

the Eleventh Circuit that Mr. Kurzban is now emphasizing

10

the difference between the statutory remedy and the

11

constitutional remedy.

12

In any event, the Court of Appeals for the

13

Eleventh Circuit has clearly stated the law with respect

14

to the authority of the Attorney General and the

15

Congress to parole pending the determination whether

2

The reason is, and the whole case comes down

3

to the fact that the same rules that this Court has

4

pronounced over a period of more than a century

5

applicable to the decision whether to admit or to

6

exclude are also both from considerations of the

7

practical necessities of the parole decision and also by

8

the square holding of this Court in Mezei, which has not

9

been overruled, required to be judged by the same

10

st andards.

11

What I propose to do is to develop first those

12

rules that pertain to the entry decision,

13

14

our argument that the same rules apply to parole.

in the process, since it was our friends who asked the

MR. LEE:

Why don’t you first address the

Yes.

That, of course, gets us back

7

also to what I will refer t.o as the Ashwander point,

8

whether it should be resolved on some non-constitutional

9

-- whether the whole case should be resolved on some

10

non-constitutional ground as opposed to the

11

constitutional ground.

12

and normally that is the approach that ought

13

to be taken, and certainly we would have no objection to

14

the Court taking that approach in this case.

15

simply point out in fairness that this case may

16

different, because not only have the petitioners

17

switched positions in midstream, but also, as I read it,

18

the Ashwander approach is a discretionary approach that

19

says that we are not going to reach constitutional

20

issues unless we have to reach them, but it is not -- it

21

may be in this particular instance that the Court might

22

conclude, given the review of that District Court

opinion, that the likelihood that that court is going to

QUESTION;

General Lee, before you get into

3

the main part of your argument, I am still puzzled by

4

part of the en banc court’s disposition, which, as I

5

read Page 330 of this appendix, it contemplates a remand

6

to the District Court in order to determine whether the

7

people in detention are properly detained, and as a part

8

of that determination to decide whether there is any

9

discrimination going on.

10

Why did they do that?

11

MR. LEE;

I am not sure.

It m3y have been on

12

an assumption, Justice Stevens, that these 400 people to

13

whom Mr. Kurzban referred, who have got to be post-Judge

14

Spellman’s entry arrivals, are part of the class.

15

Now, Judge Spellman has indicated in a

16

footnote that that may not be the case, but it may be

17

that the Court of Appeals assumed that they were part of

18

the class, and therefore evidence could be introduced as

19

to them.

20

QUESTION;

Doesn’t that imply an unwillingness

21

to accept at face value the finding of no

22

discrimination?

23

MR. LEE;

Well, not necessarily, if you do

24

assume that the class applies to these post-judgment

25

arrivals, because there could be some additional facts -24

I would like to discuss just one of the

11

petitioners' bases for alleged distinction of the Mezei

12

case, and that is that in Mr. Kurzban's words, this is a

13

case about illegal discrimination, that this case is

14

different because there is an allegation of national

15

origin discrimination which in other contexts bring into

16

play heightened judicial scrutiny.

17

The problem with that argument is that it

18

comes about

19

that same argument that reliance by the excluded alien

20

on constitutional positions which in other contexts

21

entitle their beneficiaries to heightened scrutiny was

Indeed, if anything,

the reason.

MR. LFE;

The only difference is a time

QUESTION;

But you wouldn’t say that about the

8

difference between solitary confinement and general

9

10

MR. LEE;

Of course not, because those do not

11

pertain to the judgment whether to admit or not admit.

12

And

13

that is the dividing line in my view,
QUESTION:

Well,

and I think --

are they really identical,

14

Mr. lee, because presumably someone paroled could have

15

parole revoked and then be excluded, could they not?

16

MR. LEE:

Of course, and an alien once

17

admitted can also have that admission revoked, and can

18

be deported, but the point

19

faithfully reporting the decisions of

announced by this Court in Landon versus Plasencia is

down to Congress's constitutional authority.

Congress has done is to establish a constitutional rule

command that aliens are to be excluded, period, and then

11

it gives to the Attorney General the discretion to

determine in his discretion whether in certain instances

13

parole or temporary admission should be granted.

14

Accordingly, the issue is not whether the

15

petitioners are right or we are right concerning the

16

likely risk of admitting aliens prior to the time that

17

their entry decision is made.

18

whether Congress has the constitutional authority tc

MR. KURZBAN:

Lip service to what?
Lip service to the question of

race and nationality discrimination, because while

making a broad holding on the constitutional grounds,

6

then gave a very narrow standard of review, the facially

7

legitimate and bona fide standard, and under that

8

standard mere protestation of innocence, for example,

may be enough.

10

This Court has said when it comes to the

facially legitimate and bona fide standard that we will

not look behind the exercise of discretion.

practical point of how we would prove a discrimination

look behind that exercise of discretion.

Just frcm a

If immigration officials on remand were to

17

say, well, we did this because we did not discriminate,

18

or we did this because we believed that there was some

19

deterrent, under the standard enuncicated in Kleindienst

20

versus Mandel, which are appropriate when the Attorney

21

General may act or appropriate when Congress may pass a
