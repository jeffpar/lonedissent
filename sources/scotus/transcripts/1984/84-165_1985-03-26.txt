ORAL ARGUMENT OF ROBERT C. EPSTEIN, ESQ.,

7

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

8
9

MR. EPSTEIN;

Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Court, it is our contention that

10

Mr.

11

decision is joint management of the Continental business

12

in which he repeatedly referred to himself as a partner

13

and the fact that this was an entirely private

14

transaction unique between two individuals which in no

15

sense involved a public capital market, that these

16

collective factors require the conclusion that in

17

substance this was the purchase of a one-half interest

18

in a business, and that the transfer of stock was merely

19

incidental to the transaction.

20

Ruefenacht's right to veto every major company

We submit that the federal securities laws

21

were never meant to cover this kind of a transaction,

22

and

23

state court.

24

Honors, we rely fundamentally upon the legislative

25

history of the federal securities laws.

that Mr. Ruefenacht's claims of fraud belong in
As authority for our position, Your

3
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Mow, it is true, as was pointed out this

2

morning, that the legislative history does not

3

specifically address the sale of business situation, and

4

indeed both factions in the current judicial debate

5

acknowledge that Congress never specifically considered

6

the sale of business question.

7

However, the legislative history is replete

8

with an unmistakeable Congressional emphasis upon the

9

goals that the securities laws do seek

to achieve.

10

Those goals, reaffirmed in the legislative history as

11

recently as 1982, and as expressed by this Court in

12

Forman fundamentally were to protect the integrity of

13

public capital markets and to protect investors dealing

14

in those markets.

15

Now, the legislative history also indicates

16

that these goals emerged from a Congressional

17

recognition that the dispersion of corporate ownership

18

had led to abuses in the capital markets where people

19

who ran corporations were taking advantage of people who

20

owned corporations.

21

Most importantly. Your Honors, it was

22

recognized by Congress that the effects of such abuses

23

transcend the individual’s less, but rather chill

24

investment and capital formation generally.

25

It was also recognized by Congress that such
4
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

abuses could be perpetrated because the owners of

2

corporations did not have managerial control over the

3

operations of those corporations.

4

symbols of ownership but had no ability effectively to

5

influence the destiny of their investment or to

6

influence the operations or the profitability of the

7

corporation.
There is nothing, not one word in the

8
9

The owners held the

legislative history about protecting someone like Mr.

10

Max Ruefenacht, who engaged in a purely private

11

transaction, unique, as I said, between two individuals

12

which indeed involved stock which could not have been

13

publicly traded because it did not have a common or

14

equivalent value to most people.
QUESTIONI

15

Well, this argument would lead to

16

just saying that there isn't any private sale of stock

17

that was reached by the securities law.

We are a purely private

QUESTION:

Well, so are thousands of others

(202) 628-9300

1

that are covered, I suppose
MR. EPSTEIN:

2

Well, that may be so, Your

3

Honor.

May I point out that where the context is a

4

public context involving either an organized exchange cr

5

a public solicitation, such as was involved in Howey and

6

other cases, in our view, that goes so much to the heart

7

of what Congress was talking about when it passed the

8

securities laws that there ought to be coverage.
Where you are dealing, however, in an entirely

9
10

private context, the inquiry has to be a little deeper.

11

That is not to say that private transactions will

12

necessarily not be covered, but the inquiry is into the

13

economic realities of those transactions.
And if I may at this point, in further answer

14
15

to your question, Your Honor —

QUESTION;

1

Well, what if the stock isn't

2

registered?

It is just a small corporation.

3

some shares of a private company from another person, no

4

public — is that a public matter?
HR. EPSTEIN;

5

No, Your Honor.

I just buy-

The way you

6

have framed that hypothetical, no, that seems to be an

7

entirely private and unique transaction.
QUESTION*

8

Would that be covered by the

9

securities laws under your view?

10

MR. EPSTEIN;

Under my view, Your Honor, an

11

entirely private transaction like the one you just — I

12

would have to ask Your Honor some more questions about

13

the facts.

14

QUESTION;

You may.

15

(General laughter.)

16

HR* EPSTEIN;

The first question I would ask

17

would be whether Your Honor as the purchaser of that

18

stock in a privately held corporation --

19

20
21

QUESTION;

I would have to report it at a

certain way.
MR. EPSTEIN;

I understand that, Justice.

22

Whether Your Honor participated in some fundamental

23

sense in the activities of that corporation.

24
25

QUESTION;

I just bought the stock for

investment, and that is all I wanted to do.
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. EPSTEIN:

Assuming that to be true. Your

2

Honor, I would also ask whether this stock that Your

3

Honor bought was a smaller unit of a larger offering or

4

whether it was --

5

QUESTION:

No, it was just -- the stock has

6

been in these same hands for a long time.

7

was just tired of owning it, so he sold it to me.

MR. EPSTEIN:

9

QUESTION:

The fellow

Not covered, Your Honor.

Not covered.

10

MR. EPSTEIN:

11

QUESTION:

12

MR. EPSTEIN:

Not covered.

Is that the established rule or -Well, Your Honor, there is no

13

established rule.

14

reasons that we are here today, because there is

15

confusion, but on this point of public versus private, I

16

would like to raise and bring to the Court’s attention

17

the Superintendent of Insurance case, which has been

18

cited by my opponents all throughout this litigation as

19

standing for the proposition that private transactions

20

are covered by the securities laws.

21

That is,

I believe, one of the

It is true, as Justice Douglas pointed out

22

there, that that was a private transaction.

However,

23

there was an important public element to that

24

transaction, which was that the securities that were

25

sold in that case were Treasury bonds.
8
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

These aere securities that ware, if not being

2

publicly traded at that time, were certainly of a common

3

or equivalent value to most people, and therefore could

4

have been publicly traded, and therein, I submit to the

5

Court, lies an important public interest in that private

6

transaction.
Now, we submit, Your Honor, that there is

7

8

nothing in the legislative history indicating a desire

9

to protect someone like Nr. Ruefenacht, who, as I said,

10

engaged in a purely private transaction, idiosyncratic,

11

as between two individuals, which involves no public

12

captail market.
There is nothing in the legislative history

13
14

indicating a desire to protect Nr. Ruefenacht, who

15

jointly managed this company, and who was no more

16

dependent upon others in this business than one partner

17

is dependent upon another partner to use his or her best

18

efforts and inimmitable talents to make a business a

19

success.

20

Indeed, may I point out to the Court that

21

there was no one in this business who had more control

22

over profitability than Mr.

23

specifically point to Magistrate Peretti's findings on

24

the fact that Mr. Ruefenacht’s veto powers extended not

25

just to questions of capital structure of this company,

Ruefenacht, and

I

9
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

such as the issuance or transfer of shares, but also tc

2

operational decisions going right to the heart of what

3

this company's business was, namely, questions of

4

borrowing money and of the taking on of new product

5

lines.

6

We submit that this Court in evaluating this

7

transaction under the securities laws cannot ignore

8

Congress's goals simply because there was stock involved

9

in the transaction, but in effect that is just what the

10

Third Circuit did by looking only to the characteristics

11

of the stock and ignoring all of the findings found by

12

the magistrate.

13

We don't believe that the literal or

14

mechanical approach taken by the Third Circuit was ever

15

intended by Congress in the application of the federal

16

securities laws.

17

flexibility in application of the securities laws, but

18

does not say that the Court shall be flexible only where

19

the result will be to extend coverage.

20

The legislative history urges

Also, the context clauses, whether they be

21

viewed as relating to the economic context ofthe

22

transaction, as we believe this Court clearly held in

23

the Weaver case, or as relating to the linguistic

24

context of the statute, as the Third Circuit said, in

25

either of them, I submit to the Court that the context
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

clauses amount to Congressional caveats against

2

literalism and amount to a sufficient basis for the

3

District Court looking into the economic realities of

4

this transaction.
Finally, as we read this Court's decisions

5

6

from Joiner through Weaver, the Court has never taken a

7

literal or mechanical approach to the securities laws,

8

but rather has repeatedly cautioned against just such an

9

approach.

10

Now, I submit, Your Honors, that the flaws in

11

the Third Circuit's approach to the securities laws are

12

perhaps put best in focus when one considers application

13

of the securities laws to transactions in notes.

14

Under a literal approach, all note

15

transactions would be covered including mortgage notes

16

executed in connection with the purcnase of a single

17

family residence, and also including notes executed in

18

connection with consumer financing transactions.

19

But both sides of the current judicial debate,

20

including such eloquent proponents of the literal

21

approach as Judge Friendly and Judge Gibbons below, both

22

sides acknowledge that Congress just could not have

23

meant to cover those kinds of transactions, and as a

24

result both sides, with some variations, employ a case

25

by case analysis in the note context to determine which
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

note transactions implicate federal securities laws

2

concerns.

3

T submit to the Court that the very same type

4

of case by case analysis is just as essential in the

5

stock area for the very same reasons, namely, to avoid

6

sweeping within the coverage of the federal securities

7

laws a multitude of cases which involve no significant

8

federal concern but which happen to involve stock.

9

One of the concerns which led the Third

10

Circuit to rule as it did was what can be called the

11

line drawing concern, a concern by Judge Gibbons about

12

distinguishing covered transactions from non-covered

13

transactions.

14

I submit to the Court that that concern can be

15

greatly ameliorated by the decision in this case.

16

narrow holding here that Mr. Ruefenacht’s absolute veto

17

powers, joint management, and the fact that this was a

18

unique transaction, that those factors require a

19

conclusion that this was not a federal securities

20

transaction --

21

QUESTION:

ft

What is your — I know you say we

22

ought to look at the economic realities and all that.

23

am not sure I know even what you mean.

24

that you should look to see if the purchase is for

25

investment or for management or for what?

Is it your view

I

MR. EPSTEIN;

1

The objective of the

2

transaction, Your Honor, is one of the economic

3

realities.

4
5

That is precisely correct.
QUESTION-.

Well, which is it?

And here the -Which is

covered and which isn't?
MR. EPSTEIN;

6

There are gradations of cases,

7

Your Honor, and it is difficult for me to answer that

8

entirely in the abstract.
QUESTION;

9
10

I can say to Your Honor --

Well, if you can't, I don't know

what kind of a bright line you are drawing.
MR. EPSTEIN;

11

Your Honor, the line we are

12

drawing is between the kinds of transactions Congress

13

intended to cover and did not intend to cover.

14

see if I can -QUESTION;

15
16
17

That is fine.

Let me

Now tell me what it

is.
MR. EPSTEIN;

Okay.

When we are dealing with

18

"public transactions," and I put that term in quotes,

19

Your Honor, transactions which involve the public

20

capital markets, whether organized or not, I submit that

21

we are involved with a situation going so fundamentally

22

to the concerns of Congress that the federal securities

23

laws ought to apply as a general proposition.

24
25

Where we are dealing in private transactions.
Your Honor, the inquiry has to be into whether the
13

(202) 628-9300

1

purchaser in this case was dependent upon the efforts of

2

others or not dependent upon the efforts of others.

3

That inquiry involves two components as I see it.

4

QUESTION;

In general you are talking about

5

whether he is making an investment or whether he is

6

buying it to make money by himself.
MR. EPSTEIN;

7

8

Honor.

10
11

In a general sense,
QUESTION;

9

That is exactly correct. Your
that is true.

Well, refine it if that is too

general.
NR. EPSTEIN;

Well, there are two components

12

to that inquiry.

13

the control analysis that was performed by the

14

magistrate and by the District Court below, where

15

someone obtains the kind of control that Nr. Ruefenacht

16

obtained over a company.

17

Component Number One, as we see it, is

He is not the kind of investor that Congress

18

was seeking to protect.

19

vulnerable position which generates a need for the

20

special protections of the federal securities laws.

21

QUESTION;

He is not in that peculiarly

He didn't have an affirmative

4

22
23

control, did he?
HR. EPSTEIN;

He could not impose his will on

24

the Corporation, Nr. Chief Justice, that is correct, but

25

what he could do —
14
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

QUESTION;

He could veto.

2

MR. EPSTEIN;

That is exactly right, Your

3

Honor, and not only that, through his joint management

4

of the company as a result of his efforts in obtaining

5

sales and operations and so on and so forth, he had, as

6

the magistrate found, a fundamental influence over

7

whether this corporation did well or did not do well.

8

So he was anything but a passive investor in that

9

sense.
QUESTION:

10

You speak to the veto power.

11

veto cuts both ways, doesn't it?

12

MR. EPSTEIN;

The

Yes, Your Honor, in the sense

13

that Mr. Ruefenacht could not do anything without his

14

partner going along.

15

QUESTION;

Exactly.

16

MR. EPSTEIN;

That is exactly right, Your

17

Honor.

18

submit that Mr. Ruefenacht’s veto powers amount to

19

fundamental control going right to the heart of --

20

There was here a deadlock situation, but we

But it is also a good way to

protect his invetment, isn’t it?

22

MR. EPSTEIN;

In a generic sense of the term

23

"investment,” Your Honor, that is true.

In a generic

24

sense. Your Honor, almost anything that you buy can be

25

considered an investment to the extent that you expect

Yes, but a veto power doesn’t

investment.

MB. EPSTEIN:

It has just

You may not want to

That is true.

I suppose in the

Weaver case, Your Honor, the Weavers were in a sense

10

seeking only to protect their investment, but

11

nevertheless the Court found that their measure of

12

control simply over the borrowing of money was

13

uncharacteristic of the security.

14
15

If I may, I would like to turn to some of the
concerns that --

16

QUESTION;

May I ask a question?

17

MR. EPSTEIN:

18

QUESTION:

Yes, Your Honor.

We are all trying to grasp exactly

19

where the dividing line is.

20

then, I gather,

21

from the Securities Act?

You don't take the position

that every sale of control is exempt

22

MR. EPSTEIN:

23

No.

It is only if there is a sale of

control and the purchaser thereafter relies on the

If we are dealing in a totally

private setting, not a publicly traded security in any

14

sense --

15

QUESTION*

Not a publicly traded security.

16

MR. EPSTEIN;

Then it would not be covered,

17

and the fact that management was delegated to somebody

18

else makes no difference.

19

20
21

QUESTION;

So is every sale of control of an

unlisted security exempt under your view?
MR. EPSTEIN*

No, Your Honor.

I am not

22

making a distinction between whether a security is

23

listed on an organized exchange.

24

and I am sure there are, closely held corporations which

25

go into the "public capital markets" to obtain funds and

as a result of going into those markets they implicate a

2

federal securiies interest, in my view.
If there is some wide dispersion of ownership,

3
4

even though the security is not listed on any exchange,

5

the transfer of 100 percent of that security may very

Every sale

unlisted security, always exempt?
MB. EPSTEIN;

Yes, Your Honor, I believe sc.

I can't see a situation where it would not be.
QUESTION;

All right, then the next question

14

is, all sales of control of an unlisted security by

15

control block, 52 percent 30, or whatever it takes to

16

constitute realistic control of an unlisted security,

17

always exempt?

18

MR. EPSTEIN;

Yes, if -- yes, if that

19

security was not of a nature which could be publicly

20

marketable.

QUESTION;

Well, I mean, if it is a big

company, you are always going to be publicly marketed.
MR. EPSTEIN:

Well, if we are talking about a

24

security, Your Honor, which has roughly equivalent value

25

to most people, and I take that language from the Weaver

1

case, if we are dealing in that kind of security, in my

2

view, you start to implicate the kinds of Congressional

3

concerns that I have been trying to address.

4

So, I can't give you a categorical answer on

5

that point, Your Honor.

Your Honor is giving me a

6

quizzical look, and I am trying to give you the best

7

answer that I can, but I have to qualify it because

8

there can be no categorical rule, I don't believe, in

9

these kinds of situations.
As the Weaver court stated, it is important to

10
11

look to the entire factual matrix.

12

factual matrix, I submit, is the nature of the

13

instrument, whether it was idiosyncratic to that -QUESTION;

14

One element of that

I am assuming, you know, ordinary

15

common stock, you know.

16

idiosyncratic instruments.

We have just ordinary

17

stock.

But I still — I just really

18

don't understand your distinction.

19

I am net talking about

That part is easy.

MR. EPSTEIN;

Your Honor, when I talk about

20

idiosyncratic instruments, I am talking about the kind

21

of stock that was involved in this case, which had value

22

only as between Mr.

23

no widespread value to anyone else, had no equivalent

24

value, as I said before, to other people.

25

QUESTION;

Ruefenacht and Mr. Burkle, and had

Why didn't it have value to

somebody else?

You say they resold 10 percent to each

2

of ten people.

Why wouldn't that have value?

3

MR. EPSTEIN;

It would have value in that

4

sense, but it did not have the kind of value that

5

existed between these two people.

6

the facts that the magistrate found was that the

7

purchase price of the stock was in part related to Mr.

8

Ruefenacht rendering his services to the corporation.

9

For example, one of

That is an element of the uniqueness of this

10

transaction between these two individuals which is

11

different from a transaction we hypothesize where the

12

stock would be sold to somebody else.

13
14

QUESTION;

But you would come out differently

if it were a publicly traded security?

15

HR. EPSTEIN;

16

QUESTION;

Yes, Ycur Honor --

You would agree, sale of control of

17

a publicly traded security with management prerogatives

18

and all this is covered by the Act?

19

MR. EPSTEIN;

Yes, Your Honor.

Frankly, I

20

can't distinguish that conceptually from a tender offer

21

situation, because when you are dealing in public

22

markets, you get so much to the heart of what Congress

23

was talking about in the securities laws that I think

24

the securities laws do apply in Your Honor's

25

hypothetica 1.

(202) 628-9300

Now, to address some of the concerns of the

1
2

Court below, one concern was that application of the

3

so-called sale of business doctrine would lead to

4

anomalous results.

5

that the Third Circuit did not find that it would be

6

anomalous in this case or inconsistent with the

7

legislative goals in this case to disqualify the

8

transaction from coverage.

But may I point out to the Court

Admittedly, there have been raised in the

9
10

briefs and in the academic commentary a great number of

11

very perplexing factual issues, and we don’t purport to

12

address all hypothetical cases today.
What we do ask the Court for is a ruling on

13
14

this case, which we believe will set forth clearly the

15

applicable principles, and the so-called anomalous cases

16

we believe will in large measure take care of

17

themselves.

18

Also, the Court below was concerned about

19

devoting federal judicial resources to the economic

20

substance inquiry.

21

have a two-day non-jury hearing before the magistrate

22

devoted to the issue of control, but the projected trial

23

time that was save! by that inquiry was far greater than

24

two days.

25

Now, it is true that in this case we

Now, I cannot prove this, Your Honors, but I
21

submit to you that the vast majority of questions of

2

coverage under the securities laws will be clear.
Securities involved in organized exchanges,

5

offerings or purchases,

clearly covered.

those cases, in my view, are

Where there is a legitimate issue concerning

7
8

federal securities laws coverage, which I submit will

9

occur most frequently in the private sphere, I submit

10

that the resources devoted to that inquiry are well

11

worth the savings in federal trial time otherwise

12

devoted to questions or matters which involve no

13

significant federal concern, but which happen to involve

14

stock .
Finally, as I started to say earlier, the

15
16

Third Circuit was mightily concerned about where to draw

17

the line.

18

concern greatly in issue.

19

said, I hope this case will help to ameliorate, but I

20

don't believe that simply by adopting a mechanical test

21

which makes line drawing very easy is the answer to that

22

problem.

No.

You don’t mean either way.
Your Honor leads me to an

15

interesting point, and that is the point of common

venture which was raised earlier in the colloquy, and I

17

would like to tackle that one head-on.

18

difficult point.

19

It is a

As we pointed out, the federal courts seem to

20

be very confused about what is a common venture.

21

submit to you that there was no common venture in this

22

case, and as authority for that position I rely upon

23

Howey and I rely upon Weaver.

24
25

I

I point out to you that in the Howey case
where the common venture requirement was framed, the

several hundred.

3

I point out to you that in the Weaver case, in

at the end of the opinion on the fact that there was a

6

privately negotiated, face-to-face transaction unique as

7

between two individuals.

there was great emphasis

I suggest to you that juxtaposing those two
cases leads to the conclusion that where you have, as in

10

this case, a completely unigue transaction between two

11

privately contracting parties, that that is not the kind

12

of common venture that this Court has been addressing

13

over the last 40 years, and we therefore ask the Court

14

based upon the facts of this case and net upon

15

hypothesized concern or the single fact relied upon by

16

the Third Circuit, which essentially was that there was

17

stock involved in this transaction, we ask the Court to

OPAL ARGUMENT OF PETER STEVEN PEARLMAN, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE REPONDENTS

MR. PEARLMAN;

Mr. Chief Justice,

2

common stock of Continental Import and Export, Inc., I

3

submit that to accept the sale of business doctrine will

4

require this Court to disregard accepted principles of

5

statutory construction by ignoring the specific and

6

unambiguous language of the securities statutes, abandon

7

its own prior precedent and policy, and to adopt a

8

policy which is ambiguous, unworkable, not readily

9

definable, and which creates results which are arbitrary

10
11

and unfair in the extreme.
For 50 years, and through numerous securities

12

cases, the question of whether the federal securities

13

laws apply to traditional common stock has not troubled

14

this Court, nor should it now.

15

Ruefenacht has devoted the last four years of his life

16

to litigating just that issue.

Nonetheless, Mr.

Under those prescriptions, the shares which

entitled to remedies under the federal securities laws.
Petitioner submits that we must depart from

the letter of the statute, that we must ignore its plain

say perceived, I mean petitioner's perceived intent of

statute.
The simple introductory answer to that is that

it is not up to a Court to examine legislative history

20

examination of the legslative history does not avail

traditional attributes of stock, are securities.

This Court has said it in Joiner.

This Court

5

has said it in Tcherepnin, in Forman, and most recently

6

in Weaver, where this Court stated that the statutory

notes with a maturity of less than nine months.

includes ordinary stocks and bonds.

Nothing could be

more ordinary than the stock and the bonds which Mr.

attempting to engraft into the statute something which

is not there.

says plainly any stock.

Just the opposite is true.

We are

In fact, the attempt to toss out all other

18

portions of the definition other than that of investment

20

of legislative interpretation, but makes no sense from a

21

general common sense standpoint.

22

When this Supreme Court enunciated its opinion

23

in Howey, it specifically dealt with the case involving

24

an investment contract, and it said that the definition

25

of an investment contract is investment of money in a

I do not

believe that we should sit down and try and determine

what "notes” should be included within the statutory

I believe that the statutory definition

14

specifically excludes certain types of notes, notes with

15

a maturity of less than nine months, but I do not

16

believe that the statutory definition of notes permits

17

an examination into the underlying transaction.

18

I would suggest, however, that to the extent

19

that there is some confusion with respect to notes, it

may be that notes are a less commonly defined term than

foreclose further analysis
It may be that notes fall somewhere in

2
3

between, and it may be, although I disagree, and of

4

course, as I said, the case is not here today, but it

5

may be that with respect to notes, it is somewhat less

6

specific than stock.
It is perhaps somewhat vaguer and more akin tc

7
8

an investment contract, although not necessarily with

9

the same standard to be applied, and it may be that some

10

definition is necessary with respect to note, just what

11

a note is, what type of note we are talking about.
But there is no definition which

12

is necessary

13

with respect to traditional stock.

Stock has been

14

defined.

At least what this Court means by stock was

defined.

It was defined in Tcherepnin.

It was defined

So I do not believe that whatever problems may

17
18

have arisen in the circuit with respect to notes need

19

cause a problem with respect to whether or not this

Court should adopt or reject the sale of business

21

doctrine.

22

Until I came here or until I read the briefs,

23

I should say, in connection with this appeal and then

24

was reinforced a little bit this morning and then this

25

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

what the sale of business doctrine was.

2

sale of business doctrine was that you looked to the

3

economic realities cf the transaction and apply the

4

Howey test to see whether you fall into that category.

5

I thought the

I always felt it was impossible to really come

6

to any sort of a meaningful conclusion by use of the

7

Howey test because it necessarily excluded certain

8

things which no one had ever questioned were security,

9

such as Williams Act cases, such as many publicly traded

10

transactions, because obviously frequently when a tender

11

offer is made, there is the intent to control.

12

one of the major purposes for the tender offer.

13

That is

I now find out this morning that the Howey

14

test is not the sale of business doctrine, or vice

15

versa, because apparently under the version of the sale

16

of business doctrine which I heard today, you applied

17

the Howey test sometimes, but sometimes you don’t apply

18

the Hcwey test.

are dealing with publicly traded corporations, I guess.

you look at the Congressional intent, I guess, every

time a securities case comes tc court.
And having done that, you decide whether it is

publicly traded or privately traded, and then you have

to form your own concept of whether or not it is a

the Howey test cannot apply to transactions involving

MR. PEARIMAN;

11

Any sale of what is really

I recognize the problem that arose in

13

Forman, and without necessarily agreeing or disagreeing

14

with whether or not that was traditional stock and

15

whether it should have been considered stock, I

16

recognize that there are circumstances when having

17

called something stock doesn't mean that it really is

18

stock.

19

doesn't mean that it is.

You can suggest that the world is flat.

That

There are a number of policy considerations

20
21

which favor the rejection of the so-called sale of

22

business doctrine.

23

comes to mind, is the fact that the Securities Acts are

24

to be construed liberally to enhance their remedial

25

in ten t.

The primary, and the one that first

33
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

Certainly attempting to strike from the

1
2

definition something which is clearly there, something

3

which is unambiguously there does much damage to and

4

doesn't benefit in any way the remedial intent of the

5

securities laws.
The problem with control is something which T

6
7

have already discussed, and that is not only does any

8

test which is premised on control exclude transactions

9

which I don't think anyone would ever intend be

10

excluded, but it is very difficult to define control, as

11

to when the control was to be exercised, what is control

12

under any given circumstance, and the Ruefenacht case

13

illustrates that, I think, rather well.
There has been some suggestion that when a

14
15

person acquires control they don't really need the

16

protection of the federal securities laws, because they

17

have the ability to control the destiny of the

18

business.

19

I suppose the simple answer to that is that

20

the federal securities laws apply to fraud which took

21

place before you assumed your control, and about the

22

best you can do once you have assumed this control,

23

whatever it is, is to be in a good position to grab the

24

bucket and start bailing.

25

justification, however, for adopting the control

2

the Securities Act or in the Securities Exchange Act did

3

Congress suggest that sales of this sort of ordinary

4

stock were ever to he excluded from the securities

laws.
The petitioners' case rests in part on the

6
7

notion that only passive public investors were intended

8

to enjoy the protection of the securities laws, that

9

those who engaged in private negotiated transactions

10

where they have some ability presumably to extract

11

information for themselves are not within the protection

12

of the securities laws.
But Congress, I think, considered that issue

13
14

and reached a different conclusion.

15

Securities Act of 1933 contains exemptions from the

16

registration provisions of the Act.

19

22

registration would supply.

23

Section 4 of the

Congress made clear in the introductory phrase

24

to Section 4 that transactions excluded from

registration were included in antifraud protection.

I

1

think the arguments that petitioner makes here in this

2

regard were simply considered by Congress, and the place

3

it drew the line was between registration and antifraud

4

protection, not by excluding these private transactions

5

from the scope of the securities laws.
Petitioner argues that ordinary common stock

6
7

is not stock at all when it changes hands in a

8

transaction where the buyer acquires some measure of

9

control over the issuing company, but if this Court were

10

to adopt that theory, it would multiply the complexity

11

and expense of both SEC and private securities

12

litigation.
I would like to consider Commission litigation

13
14

first.

15

Commission enforcement actions would necessarily become

16

more complex for reasons having little or nothing to do

17

with Congress's objectives in enacting the laws.

18

Under the test the petitioner advocates,

Petitioner argues in essence that every time a

19

judge is confronted with a securities transaction, he

20

needs to make his or her own decision concerning whether

21

Congress intended federal protection to apply to that

22

tran saction.

23

Thus even if the Commission were to prove that

24

a violation had occurred under the ordinary meaning of

25

the laws, would still be open to the defendant trying to

Congress’s spirit or intent not manifested in the words

which provided a defense.

QUESTION*

Mr. Goelzer, if your view is

adopted by this Court, what is it likely to do to the

6

numbers of cases dealt with by the Commission?

MR. GOELZER*

8
9

Will it

If my view is adopted, I think

it won't have any effect on the number of cases that the

10

Commission deals with, since it has always been the

11

Commission’s assumption since 1933 and 1934 that any

12

transaction in ordinary stock is within the scope of the

13

securities laws.
The Commission would not typically bring an

14
15

enforcement action in a case involving a transaction

16

between two private parties simply because it wouldn’t

17

be a gcod use of our resources, although -QUESTION*

18

Is it likely to increase the

19

numbers of cases filed in federal courts, do you think,

20

to any significant degree?
MR. GOELZER*

21

I think not. Your Honor.

It

22

certainly wouldn’t increase them beyond what they were

23

before 1980 or 1981, since no Court had suggested that

24

this sale of business doctrine existed at all before

25

that time.

I think if the doctrine is adopted, if the

1

petitioner's position is adopted, we will have at least

2

the same number of cases, but they will all include a

long threshold consideration of whether control, a very

subjective and amorphous concept, existed in the case or

QUESTION;

What is the Commission's position

7

concerning notes, and what type of meaning should be

8

adopted for that word in the statute?

MR. GOEIZER;

10

earlier, this Court, of course, has not considered the

11

meaning of the term "note" in the —

No, I asked what the Commission's

position is.
MR. GOEIZER;

Well, as I would with stock, I

19

20

example, or f or consumer purposes.

I think it is not surprising that each term

has its own specialized meaning and its own body of case

7

there is no question, no one has suggested that it is

8

not conventional stock that is involved.
I think that a second way in which Commission

9
10

enforcement actions would be significantly burdened if

11

the petitioner’s position were adopted is that inherent

12

in that position is that each security transaction must

13

show that it meets the definition of investment

involve instruments that don't promise a share of

Rather, they promise a fixed return to the

The lower courts have disagreed concerning

19

whether a fixed return meets the profit element of the

20

Howey test, yet if it doesn't, such ordinary things as

21

long-term corporate bonds issued by blue chip companies

22

would be excluded along with irregular and unusual

23

instruments issued by individual promoters.

24
25

At best, the Commission would be forced to
relitigate all of this ground, presumably already

(202) 628-9300

suggested that there is a securities transaction fcr the

2

sellers but not for the buyers.

3

good result, and I would support it, but I think the

4

logic of the same transaction being or not being a

5

securities transaction depending upon whether you are

6

plaintiff or defendant, is illusive, and the issue would

7

undoubtedly be litigated in the lower courts and perhaps

ultimately brought back to this Court.
Finally,

uncertainty into business transactions.

All that, no matter how sophisticated the

16
17

advice they might get from counsel, all that will have

18

to await litigation in the federal courts over this

19

illusive and difficult issue of control.

20

Absent some clear directive from Congress that

21

the securities laws were intended to create this sort cf

22

uncertainty, or that it is a necessary consequence of

23

them, I think this Court should be reluctant to create

24

it.

25

For nearly 50 years, the business community,

the Courts, and the Commission have taken Congress at

2

its word, and assumed that any purchase or sale of

3

ordinary corporate securities, whether -- corporate

4

stock, whether between sophisticated or unsophisticated

5

parties, was within the antifraud protections of the

6

securities laws.
If petitioners or others believe now that that

7

8

determination should be changed, they should address

9

their arguments to the Congress, not the Courts.

This is

1

business concept is rejected, tha plaintiff’s lawyers

2

will be constrained to bring all cases that in any

3

tangential way involve stock and an allegation of fraud

4

in federal court.
Plaintiff’s lawyers, I submit, would be remiss

5

6

if not negligent in failing to bring those cases in

7

federal court so as to take full advantage of the easier

8

burden of proof under the federal securities laws and cf

9

the broader privity requirements.
Secondly, a great deal has been made about the

10
11

so-called structure of the securities laws and how that

12

supposedly indicates a Congressional intent on the sale

13

of business question.

14

argument for the simple reason that both sides of the

15

current debate recognize that Congress never considered

16

this question, and if Congress never considered this

17

question, I think that the better place to look for the

18

Congressional intent is not to the structure of the Acts

19

but to the legislative history of the Acts.

I submit that is an incorrect

Finally, the point has been made that control

20
21

or the passing of control should have no relevance

22

because fraud very often takes place before control

23

passes.

24
25

Well, there are several answers to that.
Answer Humber One is that as Congress saw it,

the dependence of the investor defines whether he was
44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

the kind of person that should, receive protection of the

2

securities lavs, and the passage of control defines

3

whether the individual was dependent.

4

Secondly, in the investment contract context,

5

in the Howey case nontext, I think all sides recognize

6

that the control analysis is very important to the third

7

prong of the Howey test, and it is important because it

8

gives courts a pathway to the legislative intent and a

9

means to evaluate whether the investor involved in a

10

particular case is in that peculiarly vulnerable

11

position which Congress sought to address.

12

Thank you, Your Honors.
