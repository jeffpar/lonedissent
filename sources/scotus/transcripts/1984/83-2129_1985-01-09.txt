were to be considered.

MR. BIZAR;

Now I start my argument with the

construction of the statute itself, the fact that there
are three provisions, three subdivisions, each of which
are preceded by the disjunctive "or”.

My brothers, in

their argument, in sugggesting the affirmants below,

the U.S. against Naftalin case, where Justice Marshall

2

speaking for the Court, said that the use of the wcrd

3

"or" at the end of a subsection or at the beginning of a

4

subsection prescribes a distinct, separate category cf

raiscon duct.

6

The second problem with or second defect in my

7

brother's argument is that there is nc clear, consistent

8

congressional statement that would suggest that 14(e) is

9

limited solely to misrepresentation.

10

Yes, there are statements by the sponsors and

11

others in Congress addressing the question of full

12

disclosure, but there are an equal number of statements

13

by members of Congress and the sponsor concerned about

14

the need to protect shareholders of the tendering -- the

15

target company with the need to have them act without

16

pressure, without the unwarranted techniques which are

17

frequently accompanied in tender offer fights.

18

QUESTIONi

The three words you were talking

19

about a moment ago are "fraudulent", "deceptive” or

20

"manipulative"is that right?

21

MR. EIZARi

22

QUESTIONi

23
24
25

That is correct.
Do you think there is any overlap

between "fraudulent" and "deceptive"?
MR. BlZAPi

No, I think not, Your Honor,

although it is somewhat unclear.

The reason for that,

S
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I

1

believe, is that if the Congress intended

2

"misrepresentation" be part of "fraudulent" or

3

"deceptive" I think they would have stopped with the

4

that
/

first subdivision,

which prohibits expressly and clearly

5

what they desired with respect to misrepresentation.

6

I think what Congress meant when they used

7

"fraudulent" and "deceptive", they were talking about

8

the very subtle areas that frequently arise in tender

9

offer fights in which they could not foresee the kinds

10

of conduct that might be wrongful, in which the

11

pressures would be placed on shareholders.

12

For example, they could lave had in mind this

13

Court's definition of fraudulent conduct,

14

time ago in Moore against Crawford,

15

of any legal or equitable duty which injures a party --

distinct different categories tecause I don’t believe

2

Congress meant, to have those defined as such.

3

what Congress meant to have is to allow the courts the

4

greatest leeway to ensure that the franchise given to

5

the target company shareholders would not be tampered

with.

QUESTION{

8

I think

And you say "manipulative", the

third word, does not require any element of deception?

9

MR. EIZAR :

10

QUESTIONS

That is correct. Your Honor.
That isn’t consistent with our

11

Court's construction of that word in that earlier, what

12

is it, the Santa Fe case.

I may,

We say that definitions given for

considerations are not necessarily the same

definitions to be given in

14(e).

^his Court has

22

repeatedly said that the same terms used in the

23

Securities Act in different sections do not necessarily

24

have identical meanings, but they can have different

25

meanings.

For example, for 16(b) purposes, a merger is
10

(202) 628-9300

1

not a sale, whereas for 10(b) purposes a merger is a

2

sale.

3

Now why should it be that there should be a

4

different consideration for 10(b) than

5

that for 10(b) the Congress and the courts are concerned

6

with the integrity of a purchase and a sale.

V’e say

They want

14(e) does not concern itself with trading

What 14(e) is concerned with, and this is

11

frequently lost sight of, is the right of the target

12

company shareholder to be able to make his choice as to

13

whether or not to elect to accept the tender offer or

14

not to elect to accept a tender offer, or to be free to

15

sell it someplace else.

16

And that choice is not to be tampered with.

17

Indeed, the congressional statements are replete with

18

the idea that there is a delicate balance that cannot be

19

tipped.

regulations under 14(e).

3

that 14(d) also prescribes the necessity for a tender

offer to contain full information, and the Commission

5

has issued tons of regulations under 14(d) requiring

6

full disclosure.

7

It may recall to the Court

But in 14(e) — and I only quote two of those

8

regulations — it requires, first, that the tender offer

9

be kept open for 20 business days, and in subdivision

10

(c) provides that when the tender offer is completed

consideration has to be paid promptly or, if it’s

that you are right, that you need something mere --

21

It would be helpful to me if you would explain

22

what elements you think your complaint alleges that

23

satisfy the reading of the statute you propose.

24

a little difficulty with why, other than breach of

25

contract and so forth, why you say it violates the

(202) 628-9300

I have

2

ME. BIZAR;

let me start by saying that none

3

of tha lower courts considered the question of whether

4

our complaint stated a claim fer manipulation.

5

assumed that misrepresentation was the necessary

6

element.

7

They all

We say the manipulation occured as follows;
When they cancelled the 51 percent subscribed

8

tender offer, not because of any event which had

9

occurred outside but solely by virtue of the

10

intervention of the El Paso management to induce

11

Eurlington Northern to make a better deal for the El

12

Paso management and caused a new offer to be made under

13

more restrictive terms in the sense of less shares,

14

while tying up the stock, the balance of the stock

15

needed to obtain control so that no one else, no ether

16

white knight would come in and offer a competitive bid,

17

that manipulated the situation vis-a-vis the El Paso

18

stock.

19

And, more importantly, we say what it did do

20

was take awary the results and fruits of the prior

21

tender offer.

22

which a tender offer is made pursuant to the

23

regulations, pursuant to the statute, full information

24

having been given, the shareholders of the target

25

company make their choice and tender, and

We say 14(e) has to cover a situation in

so that the

2

To have respondents then take away the fruits

3

of that choice tampers with the free choice that was

4

given to the shareholders under 14(e).

5

elements we say —

Now my brothers ignore the rule that a

attempt to assert a whole slew of other facts,

Now I think I have recited to Your Honors the
factual pattern.

My brothers try to argue that their --

10

that those kinds of things are really breach of

11

contract, breach of fiduciary obligations, and suggest

12

to you that those are best left to the state court.

13

say that that is clearly net that they have attempted to

14

isolate the transaction into different carts, but that

15

the transaction is a continuous one and running it

16

continuously through there was an attempt taken to

17

interfere with the franchise given to the target company

13

shareholders to make their election and, as a result,

19

damage occurred.

is to protect an offeror and its own

dollars to an acquisition effort from circumstances
which could defeat or frustrate the purpose of an

The shareholders were fully informed of these

other thing.

let me say one

At the time that this agreement was

entered into there’s a lot of talk, about us having the
shares locked up in our treasury, that we had the right
to purchase them.

We had no right to purchase those

shares at that time.
The shareholders had two more days in which to
withdraw their tenders.

The world knows that a lot of

things happen to tender offers in those two days.

If a

white knight or some other party had come in on one of
those two days, we have no right to buy those shares.
So just as we had the right under our contract to
terminate the tender offer, El Paso shareholders
similarly had the right under the Williams Act to
withdraw their tenders.
Both sides at that moment in time still had
the rights provided for them both by the Williams Act
and by the contractual provisions themselves.

So what

we did, what Burlington and El Paso did, was enter into
an agreement which -- a normal and typical acquisition
agreement which provided benefits for everyone.

The

benefit it provided for Burlington, first, is that we
were able to acquire the 50 percent interest that we had
sought to acquire.
Another benefit it provided for Burlington was
