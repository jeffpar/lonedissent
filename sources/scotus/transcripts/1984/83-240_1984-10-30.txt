Nr. Raywid, the counties are

Now, once having created such an entity under

21

the state ccnsitution of South Dakota, it cannot destroy

22

that entity, except with popular vote.

23

But perhaps the state need not have created

24

this county.

Having dene sc, and having conferred on it

25

governmental powers, the state is obliged

to respect

Well, obliged by the precedent of

2

States and the congressional statute -QUESTION:

3

It's one thing to say that Congress

4

has mandated these funds to the counties and

5

notwithstanding

6

and the state, the Congress wanted the counties to have

7

the final authority to say that.
That is certainly an understandable argument

based cn federal law.

But I understood you to make an

10

argument that federal law also somehow requires South

11

Dakota, the legislature to observe the county status

12

because there are provisions in the South Dakota statute

13

-- the South Dakota constitution that require it.
MR. RflYWIT:

14

Bell, I think that what the

15

federal statute attempted tc do was to confer authority,

16

discretionary authority for the expenditure of funds on

17

the local unit of government.
It then,

18

cf course, looked to the state

19

government as tc what units of local government had teen

20

created.

21

the State cf South Eakcta had created counties and

22

conferred upon them general governmental authority.

23

In South Dakota, there is no question but that
