ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. KUHLIK*

Mr.

Chief Justice, and may it

Mr. Kuhlik, I think ycu

The question in this case is who is the proper
party to control the attorney-client privilege of a

corporation in bankruptcy.

the corporation's management.

privilege.

16

Our position is

Control over the privilege rests with
The bankruptcy trustee

This case arises out of the demise of a

17

commodity brokerage firm, Chicago Discount Commodity

18

Brokers.

19

Frank McGhee, who is one of the Respondents in this

20

Court, had embezzled several million dollars in customer

21

funds.

22

Over a period of time, the firm's President,

And by the fall of 1980 the firm's finances

23

were in such disarray that the Commodities Futures

24

Trading Commission filed a complaint in federal court

25

alleging various violations of the Commodities Exchange

Act, and the same day that the complaint was filed the

2

brokerage firm, through Frank McGhee,

3

time its sole remaining officer and director, entered

4

into a consent decree with the Commission that provided

5

for the appointment of a receiver.

6

who was at that

John Notz was appointed the receiver and he

7

immediately took control of the firm’s operations.

8

quickly became clear to him that really the best course

9

for the firm was to file for bankruptcy and, pursuant to

10

an express authorization in the consent decree, he filed

11

a voluntary petition for liquidation under subchapter IV

12

of chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code.

13

It

closing out its contracts in an orderly fashion as

quickly as possible.

Pursuant to Section 766 of the code, the

8

trustee in a commodity broker bankruptcy must identify

9

contracts that may be transferred to solvent commodity

10

brokers, he must seek customer instructions, he must

11

make and meet margin payments daily, he must be prepared

12

to accept or to deliver commodities in contracts that

13

cannot be closed out before their closing dates.

14

QUESTIONS

Mr. Kuhlik, I’m curious about how

15

this process would work.

16

ultimately that a trustee in bankruptcy has the power to

17

waive the privilege for the corporation, is that limited

18

in any way?

19

power to waive it if it will somehow benefit the

20

estate?

21

Assuming that you are correct

In other words, is that qualified by a

And if so, is it somehow necessary that the

22

trustee would find out first what it is that’s going tc

23

be waived before making that decision, and how would

24

that be accomplished?

25

MP. KUHLIK:

You ask a number of questions,

obviously in a better position in this case than Frank

We feel that the trustee is the best

QUESTION:

Well,

He is

wouldn't the trustee have to

15

know what the communication was before deciding whether

16

to waive it?

17

MR. KUHLIK:

Well, not in all circumstances,

18

and I would note in this particular case that the

19

McGhee * s have asserted the privilege or instructed their

20

atto rney to assert it with respect to the trustee as

21

well.

22

In this particular case, the trustee had been

23

pursuing a number of adversary actions and the CFTC had

24

as well, and tfre trustee and the CFTC were both aware

25

that the McGhee's were the people who had primarily

20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

caused the problems with this brokerage firm.

2

wase quite apparent to the trustee that waiver of the

3

privilege in favor of the CFTC with respect to the

4

questions that were asked of Mr. Weintraub in this

5

deposition would be in everybody’s best interest.

6

And it

But I would emphasize here that this

7

proceeding arises out of the subpoena enforcement

8

action.

9

10
11

QUESTION*

Well, how does the trustee know

that without knowing what the information was?
MR. KUHLIKi

Well, he knows in this case from

12

his experience in pursuing other actions against the

13

McGhee’s and other insiders, that information concerning

14

access to the safe, loans to corporate officers and the

15

like, very, very unlikely that they would redound to the

16

detriment of the estate.

17

And what we’re talking about here is a

18

question of whether this will be in the best interest of

19

the customers, the creditors, the shareholders.

20

questions that were asked of Mr. Weintraub with respect

21

to which the privilege was asserted were questions that

22

could not possibly have hurt those groups of people.

23

The only people that could have been harmed were the

24

insiders who engaged — had engaged in fraudulent

25

transactions.
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

The

1

I would emphasize here that the CFTC is

2

statutorily authorized to seek disgorgement of

3

ill-gotten gains in a proceeding such as this.

4

was quite apparent to the trustee that the CFTC was

5

seeking to go along the same lines that he himself was,

6

which was to find the money.

So it

I
7

The customers had put up these funds for

8

margin payments, for deposits,

9

supposed to be separated — "segregated" is the word

and this money was

10

that*s used in the statute — and not used for any other

11

sort of trading.

12

And what happened here was that Mr. McGhee and

13

perhaps other insiders had used this money to trade on

14

their own accounts, and it was quite apparent that the

15

only way this money was going to be recovered was to

16

determine where it had gone, what the insiders had done

17

with it.

18

And I would emphasize, though, again that this

19

is a subpoena enforcement action. If the McGhee's had

20

wished to challenge the propriety of the trustee's

21

waiver, there was a place for them to do it and that was

22

in the bankruptcy court, not in the subpoena enforcement

23

court .f

24
25

QUESTION;

And what procedures are there in

the bankruptcy court to do that?

MS. KUHLIKi

Well, at any time, Justice

2

O’Connor, anyone may file a motion with the bankruptcy

3

judge alleging that the trustee has violated his

4

fiduciary duty, has not acted in the best interest of

5

the estate.

at the beginning of the action and he is constantly

subject to supervision.

8

9

chosen to --

10

The trustee, of course, has to file a bond

QUESTIONi

So that procedure would clearly

But really, the subpoena

11

enforcement proceeding and the bankruptcy challenge are

12

two different kinds of challenge, aren’t they?

13

based on the fact that the trustee is not acting in the

14

best interest of the estate, which I would presume to be

15

the bankruptcy challenge.

One is

16

The subpoena enforcement proceeding would be

17

that of the person whose testimony is to be' compelled,

18

and

19

claims that the trustee is not acting in the best

20

interest of the estate.

21

I don’t suppose that person is limited just to

MR. KUHLIK;

No.

I would suggest. Justice

22

Rehnquist, that he doesn’t have that option available to

23

him.

24

question here of whether the trustee has the power to

25

act for the corporation the way that in a non-bankruptcy

He has the legal option of presenting the legal

(202) 628-9300

proceeding, if the board of directors had waived the

2

privilege, for example, it could be contended that they

3

weren't really the board.

4

And of course, whether or not the information

5

was in fact privileged would be a question for the

6

subpoena enforcement court.

7

suggest that the -- clearly, the question of whether the

8

trustee acted here in the best interest of the estate is

9

simply not before this Court.

10

QUESTION*

11

MR. KUHLIK*

12

QUESTION;

13

But I would strongly

On these particular facts.
On these particular facts.
That should have bean raised in the

bankruptcy court.

14

MR. KUHLIKt

Yes.

There may be circumstances,

15

with procedural difficulties, where it may arise first

16

in the subpoena enforcement court, but this is not —

17

that question simply is not before the Court.

18

QUESTION*

Well, is the power of the trustee

19

to waive the privilege limited to matters concerning the

20

estate's claims and assets?

21

MR. KUHLIK*

Well, it's difficult to imagine

22

anything that would concern the corporation's causes of

23

action that wouldn't in some way be related-to its

24

assets.

25

QUESTION;

Well, I think, it’s conceivable that
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

there might be some that aren’t related.

2

any limitation?

3

NR. KUHLIK:

And is there

I don't see any limitation on the

4

trustee's power, his absolute power, Justice O'Connor,

5

to act for the corporation.

6

everything that the trustee is given the power to do in

7

the bankruptcy code.

8

particular case has not acted in the best interest of

9

everybody, that action may be challenged.

That is clearly implicit in

And as I say, if the trustee in a

10

The trustee in this case, like other

11

liquidation trustees, has the duty to maximize the value

12

of the estate for all of the parties in interest.

13

estate in a corporate bankruptcy is composed of all of

14

the corporation's property.

15

corporation doesn't have any exempt property.

16

Everything goes into the estate.

17

The

Unlike an individual, a

And most significantly perhaps, the estate

18

includes the corporation's causes of action, its

19

litigation.

20

bankruptcy rule 6009, the trustee takes control of the

21

corporation's litigation, both its causes of action and

22

its defenses.

23

Under Section 541 of the code and under

And it would be completely anomalous to

24

suppose that the person who is in control of the

25

corporation*s litigation does not have the power to
11
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

obtain and to control its communi cations with counsel.

2

It’s simply impossible to see how his function in

3

prosecuting causes of action could be carried out

4

without access to that information.

5

And in this very case, I would note that the

6

trustee has filed over time approximately 75 adversary

7

actions seeking the recovery of approximately £6

8

million.

9

Because in bankruptcy proceedings the

10

resources of the estate are often quite limited, it

11

would not be unusual for a trustee to cooperate with the

12

Government where, as here, it is apparent that the

13

Government is looking for the same thing that the

14

trustee is, which is the missing money.

15

sort of cooperation as we’ve been discussing was

16

contemplated here.

17

And just that

And after the trustee, at the CFTC's request,

18

waived the privilege, the district court- ruled that he

19

must answer the questions and the McGhee’s, Frank McGhee

20

who I’ve mentioned and his brother Andrew McGhee, who

21

was a minority shareholder in the firm and a former

22

officer, appealed to the Seventh Circuit, and the Court

23

of Appeals reversed, holding that the trustee does not

24

have the power, absolutely doesn’t have the power, to

25

waive the corporation's attorney-client privilege.
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

This

1

conflicts with decisions of the Second, Eighth, and

2

Ninth Circuits and virtually every district and

3

bankruptcy court to consider the question.

4

Now, our position really can be summarized in

5

a nutshell:

6

7

its officers if they’re authorized to so act by the

8

board.

The privilege of a corporation is

22

MR. KUHLIK;

Do you think the privilege

Justice O’Connor, I do not think

23

as a matter of course that in every circumstance a

24

bankruptcy trustee should be able to waive an

25

individual’s privilege.

There may be circumstances that
14

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 f ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

arise in an individual bankruptcy that require such a

2

result.

3

But my main point is that whatever the Court

4

does here will not require a result one way or the other

5

in an individual case.

6

QUESTION:

What if the third party asking for

7

the information in a corporate liquidation is some tax

8

commissioner, and suppose that the disclosure of the

9

information would have the effect of revealing some
i

10

taxes that might be due that would eliminate any hope cf

11

recovery by the creditors?

12

MR. KDHLIKs

Justice O’Connor, that’s exactly

13

the situation where the trustee would not waive the

14

privilege.

15

QUESTION:

Well, how is the trustee going to

16

know unless he finds out the answer first as to what the

17

information is?

18

MR. KUHLIK:

I would suggest the facts of this

19

case may be somewhat unusual in that the trustee did not

20

have the information before him when he made the waiver,

21

and that in most circumstances one would hope that the

22

trustee would have the information.

23

But even the nature of the request and the

24

requesting party would probably give a fairly good clue

25

as to what was being sought and what it might be used

If you make that as an alternative

That is correct.

If the Court

were to adopt that argument, we feel it would apply to

We believe that the most reasoned

approach to this and the one that makes the most sense

is tc find that the trustee is the management of the

the privilege is an asset of the estate and we present

that for your consideration.

Does it follow under your

management theory that if you have a reorganization and

the reorganization trustee employs counsel and gets

legal advice, that after the reorganization successor

MR. KUHLIKs

QUESTION;

I believe that would follow.

I think what you're raising, though, is

perhaps the possibility that attorney-client

that very briefly.

13

to apply the same rule in bankruptcy proceedings that's

Your Honor, all I can say —

As the law is now, what is

than the lawyer-client privilege?

QUESTION;

What else is it?
What this case --

What makes it so different because

a lawyer’s attached to it?
MR. EPSTEIN;

Because if the corporate

13

personnel, whether it be corporate officers or, as it

14

was in the Upjohn case, lower echelon corporate

15

employees, are not free to confide in the attorneys,

16

knowing that only when it's in the company's best

17

interests, not the creditors' best interests but the

18

company's best interests, that that's going to be

19

disclosed, you're not going to have that kind of

20

disclosure.

21

You're going to have a chilling effect.

22

QUESTION:

But I thought that once you took a

23

chapter 7 or any of the others, the trustee was acting

24

in the company's interest.

25

MR. EPSTEIN;

No.

I think as counsel put it

best interests of everyone.

I would submit, four Honor, if I

may, that the principal driving force behind the

trustee's decisionmaking, unlike pre-bankruptcy

11

management's decisionmaking at all levels the trustee

12

sides with the creditors.

13

management sides with, or ought to side with or they

ought to be removed, the owners' interests, and that is

a fundamental difference.

No, I don’t think so.

What happens to the privilege

then?

QUESTION;

That’s an excellent question.

Well, I don’t know why, if you know

8

that the inevitable result in 99 percent of the cases is

9

going to be liquidation and there's nothing that old

10

management can do about it, or dissolution, what’s sc

earth-shaking about saying the trustee can waive?

not sure he even has to waive.

14

I’m

There wouldn’t have to be a waiver after
dissolution, would there?

15

MR. EPSTEIN*

Well, I don’t know.

I see

16

nothing in the ethical guidelines that tell the lawyer

17

that he’s free to disclose just because of the death cf

18

the client.

19

most states the privilege survives the death of the

One other — if I may get back to the question

that Justice O'Connor asked my opponent earlier, in

submit that if this Court, whatever it says, if it goes
