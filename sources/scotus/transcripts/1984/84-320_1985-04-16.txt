ME. SMITH;

Mr. Chief Justice, and may

has been granted leave tc participate in argument tcday

13

with respect to the first question as to which

14

certiorari has been granted.
That question presents the issue of whether a

15
16

complaint which alleges that a tribal court has exceeded

17

its jurisdiction with respect to a non-member states a

18

federal claim for relief.

19

The second question presented by this case,

20

the substantive issue cf whether under the facts here

21

the Crow Tribal Court did exceed its jurisdiction, will

22

be handled cr discussed by petitioners' counsel.
I will briefly outline the facts that are

23
24

material to determination of the first issue in this

25

case.

The facts that I will be reciting have been taken

(202) 628-9300

1

Circuit’s refusal to find a valid federal common law

2

claim and Section 1331 jurisdiction was erroneous.

3

Montana fully recognizes that federal courts

4

can and indeed are required to determine independently

5

in each case the question of whether their jurisdiction

6

has been properly invoked.

7

Nonetheless, we find it significant that pricr

8

to the Ninth Circuit’s decision in this case, none of

9

the parties had challenged the existence of a federal

10

11

common law claim cognizable under Section 1331.
The absence of such a challenge is not

12

remarkable because of the admittedly interrelated nature

13

of federal lav and

14

Indeed , the United States in its amicus brief before the

15

Court in this matter has stated that all limitations cr

16

tribal power necessarily derive from federal law,

whether in the form of constitutional principles,

18

treaties, statutes, or rudimentary propositions of

19

Indian law.

QUESTIONS

Mr. Smith, is it your position that

21

the tribal court never has jurisdiction over a

22

non-Indian defendant in a civil case?

23

MB. SMITH;

Your Honor, the State of Montana

24

as amicus has taken no position with respect to the

25

second issue in this case.

May I ask,

Mr.

Smith,

We would still then have tc decide,

That is one of the issues here, isn't it?

12

MR. SMITH;

13

Well, you are correct, Mr.

J u stice.

14

QUESTION;

15

MR. SMITH*

And what is your view of that?
Well, the question of whether

16

tribal remedies need exhaustion in this case will be

17

discussed by petitioners' counsel.

18

that in this case the Crow respondents have indicated

19

their position on that question.

20

I can only suggest

Several of the -- all. of the Crow judges have

leur Bcncr, that is the positicr

that has been taken by the petitioners below.
The Solicitor General’s position with respect

3
4

to the existence of a federal common law claim in this

5

matter, cf course, merely reflects the Court’s own

6

statement in

7

which the Court stated that Indian law generally and the

8

scope of tribal retained powers specifically must be

9

determined with reference to the treaties executed by

Cliphant versus Suquamish Indian Nation, in

10

the executive branch and legislation passed by Congress,

11

which instruments beyond their actual text form the

12

backdrop of the intricate web cf judicially made Indian

13

law.

14

Consequently, irrespective of how the second

15

issue in this case may be decided, the first question

16

must be determined, we submit,

your respondents in this matter have alleged that Issue

Number 2 is really not ripe for determination by this

refused to exhaust their tribal remedies below.

MR. HARTMAN*

Thank you.

Okay?

All right.

Thank you.

And if we might develop that

15

train of thought for just a moment, if there was ever

16

any doubt that the tribal court would entertain a

17

jurisdictional challenge, it has been dispelled by the

18

rather unusual happenings that have taken place in this

19

case over the last several months.
As

20

recently as March

11th,

1985, Judge

21

Roundfsce has uttered his order and opinion that the

22

tribal court has jurisdiction to the exclusion of the

23

Federal Eistrict Court in this matter,

24

characterizes his relationship at present with Judge

25

Batten

and in fact

as one of hopeless impasse.
17
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

So, we would conclude our remarks on

1
2

exhaustion by stating that exhaustion may be an

3

available remedy when there is a meaningful opportunity

4

to take advantage of remedies.

5

no doubt, as has been argued throughout the entire

6

course of the case, that the tribal court dees indeed

7

believe it has jurisdiction, and that is what brings us

8

to this Court .
QUESTION;

In this case, there is

Sot the judge.

What made it an

7

emergency situation was, under the Crow tribal code, on

8

November 4, respondents Sage ard Net Afraid took the

9

position that they could go execute, actually execute

10

against physical assets of the school district.
This was discussed with the beard cf trustees,

11
12

and the board of trustees are aware that under Montana

13

law there will be no physical execution against assets

14

of a school district, and that ether procedures must be

15

followed.

16

The board cf trustees was terrified that their

17

school operation, which was in effect in October of

18

1982, was in immediate danger of disruption by reason cf

to Judge Batten that we didn’t have a meaningful chance

20

Parenthetically we might add that the

21

exhaustion argument that was made by Judge Wright in

22

this matter cited several cases.

careful review will indicate that they all arose under

24

the Indian Civil Rights Act, and that they involved

These cases do not apply to a Section 1331

find for that reason it is the contention once

9
10

again cf respondents that this Court should not consider

11

Issue Number 7 a ripe one for determination, but should

12

in fact remand.
We think

13

that there is a quick answer to that

14

claim.

15

respectfully your attention to the Santa Clara Pueblo

16

case decided in 1978.

17

And as a matter of fact we would direct

Even though that case arose under and pursuant

18

tc the Indian Civil Eights Act, one cf the individual

19

tribal officers who was sued, Officer Podia, made the

20

same argument that the individual tribal defendants are

21

making right now, the argument, of course, being that as

22

tribal officers they are immune from suit.

23

This Court held, however, in Santa Clara

24

Pueblo that Hr. Podia was not immune from suit.

25

should add that from the very time the Minth Circuit

1

accepted the briefs in this case until the present/ that

2

ycur petitioners have conceded that the tribe itself and

3

the tribal governing bodies are clothed with the

4

immunity suggested by the respondents.

5

It is our position, however, that under

6

authority such as Ex Parte loung and indeed the Puyallup

7

Tribe versus Washington Department of Fish and Game that

8

the individual tribal officers themselves are amenable

9

to suit for injunctive and/or declaratory review.

10

Indeed, had they not been joined in this

11

action they would not have had the opportunity to sc

12

aggressively and thoroughly litigate the issues which

13

are of importance today before the Court.

14

would have been in our view an unfair situation.

And that

15

So certainly there is no reason to avoid

16

deciding the ultimate issue in this case under the

17

doctrine of sovereign immunity as espoused by

18

respondents.

19

Finally, ycur petitioners have all along

20

alleged and believed that the case Fontana versus United

21

States should be the case which mcst closely focuses the

22

meritorious disputes in this matter, and I say that fcr

23

several reasons.

24
25

First of all, Montana, which was, I believe,
decided in 19P1, examined the very treaties and statutes
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

that are involved in this case, because it was the Crew

2

tribe as well that was involved in Montana versus U.S.
The holding, we suggest, of Montana versus

3
4

U.S. is that the exercise of tribal power beyond

what is

5

necessary to protect tribal self-government or to

6

control internal relations is inconsistent with the

7

admittedly dependent status of the tribe as a

8

quasi-severeign.
And the only way to get around that basic

9

10

holding is if one can find express Congressional

11

delegation to the contrary.
The analysis used in Montana which led to the

12
13

holding that

14

hunting and fishing on non-member land within the

15

reservation involved basically a three or four stepped

16

analysis.

17

the tribe was without power to regulate

First of all, Judge Fatten quite correctly

18

conducted a thorough research of any relevant treaties

19

and/or statutes enacted by the Congress which may have

20

given the Crow tribal court jurisdiction in this case.

21

He found none, and indeed we suggest that there are rcre

22

that cover the peculiar cases of this case — peculiar

23

facts of this case.

24

Therefore, arcther level of inquiry arose at

25

that time, and that is, was the school district on the

That would not be a case
