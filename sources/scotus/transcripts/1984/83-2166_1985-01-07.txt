BEHALF OF THE APPELLANT

MR. MORRISON;
please

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

the Court;
In 1977 in Bates v.

8

Nr. Morrison, I think

this Court held

the State Bar of Arizona,

that the First Amendment limits the

10

ability of states to prohibit truthful advertisements by

11

lawyers.

12

speech which had been established the prior year in the

13

Virginia Pharmacy case and set aside the disipline

14

imposed on

It then applied the doctrines for commercial

the lawyers who had advertised, in that case.
In

15

19P2 in R.M.J., this Court again was faced

16

with a case cf lawyer advertising in the mass media.

17

After reaffirming the four-part test for commercial

18

speech

19

in the Central Hudson case,

20

the discipline imposed on a lawyer which had been based

21

on troad prohibitions against lawyer advertising.

22

which the Court had enunciated two years earlier
the Court again set aside

Two years later the Chio Fupreme Court, after

23

paying

lip service to both Bates and P.M.J.

24

that they did not prohibit the

1

reprimand on the appellant Philip Zauderer lecause he

2

had run a truthful ad in 36 Ohio newspapers offering to

3

represent women who had been injured as a result of

4

wearing a Daikon Shield IUD, and he had agreed to

5

represent them on a contingency basis in suits against

6

the manufacturer of the device.

7

The principal basis for reversal in this Court

8

is that the Ohio Supreme Court failed to prove that any

9

of the charges against him met the stringent

10

requirements for banning truthful ads that this Court

11

has established in commercial speech cases as applied to

12

members of the bar.

13

In order to demonstrate why none of the three

14

charges against hr. Zauderer can be sustained, it is

15

first necessary to describe the ad briefly and then in

16

some detail to review the specific charges that were

17

made against him.

18

The Daikon Shield ad appears in several places

19

in the record, most prominently at page c of the

20

jurisdictional statement.

The ad begins by askina in

21

large capital letters "Did

you use this IUD?"

22

below and to the left of the ad is a picture of the

23

Daikon Shield IUD, which incidentally is quite a

24

different device from ether IUDs that were sold by ether

25

manufacturers, and hence the picture was a particularly

?.

nd then

1

important element in the ad, and the picture is admitted

2

by all to be an accurate representation of the Daikon

3

Shield e

4

The ad then goes on to discuss specific

5

medical problems that women who use the TUD made by the

6

manufacturer encountered, including problems resulting

7

from unplanned pregnancy as well as other medical

8

disabilities.
The ad then went cn to point cut that it,

9
10

quote,

11

injuries may have taken place seme time ago, which is a

12

correct statement of the law of Ohio because it has a

13

very liberal statute of limitations with respect to its

14

tolling provisions in injuries of this kind.

15

may not be too late to sue, even though the

Following that there was a discussion of the

16

fact that the Appellant ?1 r• Zauderer was representing

17

women in cases like this and that he was prepared tc

18

represent others cn a contingent fee basic, followed by

19

his name, his address, and a telephone number.

20

Now, in light of the accuracy of this ad, it

21

is rot surprising that the Appellee, the Disciplinary

22

Counsel of the Supreme Court of Ohio, stipulated that

23

the ad, and I am new quoting, "does not contain a false,

24

fraudulent, misleading, deceptive, self-laudatory cr

25

unfair statement or claim.”

Despite this stipulation,
5

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

the Appellee has charged Appellant with multiple

2

violations of the Ohio Code of Professional

3

Responsibility, and the Ohio Supreme Court has sustained

4

those charges in three separate respects.
The first group of these charges were

5

6

violations cf the code's antisclicitation provision.

7

Now, there are two related provisions in the Ohio Cede.

8

One prohibits lawyers from reccmmendina themselves for

9

employment to a lay person who has not requested their

10

advice , and that according to the Ohio Supreme Court ,

11

that applies even though the solicitation in question

12

here took, place solely through newspapers cf general

13

circulation in Ohio.
The second and related solicitation charge is

14
15

that the Appellant here gave unsolicited legal advice,

16

presumably, the advice that it may not be too late tc

17

sue, and that the Appellant then accepted employment,

18

based upon his advertisement which contained that

19

advice.

20

that restriction to newspaper ads of general

21

circulation.

And once again, the Ohio Supreme Court applied

The second set cf charges involving the Daikon

22
23

Shield ad against Appellant related to the fact that he

24

put in his ad an accurate illustration of the Dalkcn

25

Shield.

i

Under the Ohio Code, it is.a violation to
6
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

include any illustration ether than a picture of the

2

lawyer himself or herself, or a portrait of the scales

3

of justice.

4

restriction, the only question with that has been from

5

the start whether that broad prohibition violates the

6

First Amendment.

7

Since Appellant plainly violated that

The third set of charges involving this ad

8

relate to the contingent fee portion of the ad.

The

9

Ohio Supreme Court did not criticize Appellant for what

10

he said in the ad but for what he failed to include.

11

According to the Ohio Supreme Court's code of

12

professional responsibility, for those lawyers who

13

advertise in contingent fee cases, there are two

14

affirmative disclosure requirements that must be

15

contained in each ad involving a contingent fee.

16

if the lawyer uses the word "contingent fees" at all/

17

the lawyer must include the actual rates or the

18

percentages charged, and that is true regardless of how

19

many rates the lawyer has or whether the lawyer charges

20

different fees under different circumstance.

21

rates must be disclosed in the ad itself.

22

First,

All those

Second, in addition, in all advertisements for

23

contingent fees, the lawyer must state whether the

24

percentage taken by the lawyer is before or after

25

expenses, and that is true even where the lawyer, as in
7
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

this case, did not mention any percentages at all.
So in both cases, the mere mention of the term

2
3

"contingent fees” triggers two affirmative disclosure

4

requirements under the Chic code.
Before proceeding to the specific charges, I

5

6

want tc say a word about the benefits that this

7

advertisement conferred because as this Court has

8

recognized in the Virginia Pharmacy case, Pates, and

9

many other cases involving commercial speech, that

10

benefits are an important element, and that the benefits

11

accrue net only to the speaker but also to the listener

12

or the reader, and here in that case it is principally

13

women who had used Daikon Shield IUDs at some prior

14

tim e.
Here, we need not speculate about potential

15
16

benefits because the record at the trial in this

17

proceeding amply demonstrates that there were real

18

benefits to real people that directly resulted from this

19

ad.
Now, among those who bensfitted are the nearly

20
21

10C women who contacted Appellant after they had

read

22

the ai and after conferring with him agreed to have him

23

represent them in their lawsuit to recover for these

24

very damaging injuries from the manufacturer of the

25

IUD.

For some, like Beverly Carr, the advertisement was

2

between the Daikon Shield and the injuries that she had

suffered.

the picture of the Daikon Shield because she testified

5

that she ordinarily does not read the words in written

6

advertisements, and it was the illustration that act her

7

attenticn.

And for her, the key element in the ad was

8

That is nerfectly consistent with Hr.

Zauderer's own testimony where he told the tribunal that

10

he had previously run an ad for Daikon Shield plaintiffs

11

in which he had -QUESTIONj

12

Mr. Morrison, do you -- would you

Well, I certainly would say

18

that the analysis would have tc be the same, that the

19

commercial speech test would have to be the same.

20

would have to identify the interest being asserted.

21

would then have to determine whether that interest is

22

directly advanced by a prohibition, and third, whether

there are less restrictive alternatives.

2

something different from a lawyer.
My own view without having heard what the

2

there is such a law in Ohio, would be as

3

unconstitutional as the prohibitions are here, that

4

there are real public tenefits for people knowing about

it.

6

In addition, I would point out now, wr. Chief

7

Justice, that the A. H. Pobbins Company has recently run

8

an advertisement not simply for doctors but in the

9

general publication, which is attached as an addendum to

10

may have a Daikon Shield in them, to see their

3

to tha facts of this case.

4

The question then becomes does the First

5

Amendment permit the State of Chio to discipline a

6

lawyer for running this truthful ad, and to analyze that

7

question, we must go through the analysis in Central

8

Hudson of determining whether the interest is

9

substantial, whether the interest of the state is

10

directly advanced by these prohibitions, and are the

11

prohibitions more restrictive than necessary.
Turning first to the solicitation charges, we

12
13

agree with the Appellee that advertising is simply one

14

means by which lawyers solicit clients.

15

course, is only the beginning of the inquiry for

16

advertising is precisely what was dene in Fates and

17

R . M .J . , advertising in the mass media as it was true

the First Amendment.

The only difference between those cases and

principally because the state has been unable tc

At trial it offered no evidence in

In this brief in this Court,

7

it suggests that

8

the purpose of this restriction is to deter frivolous or

9

malicious lawsuits.

We agree, of course, that deterring

10

that kind of litigation is a proper end for the state in

11

various forms of regulation.

12

believe that the antisclicitation prohibitions, as they

13

are applied to mass media in this case, has any

14

likelihood of decreasing that kind cf improper activity,

15

particularly because in contingent fee cases such as

this,

Now, in addition, there are substantial

17
18

reasons to believe that there are other alternatives far

19

less restrictive than the prohibitions here that would

enable

Now, there is another aspect ct this matter

that undercuts the point that the Appellees rely on.

this Court recognized in cates, the major problem for

individuals who seek the services of a lawyer is that

messa g e?
MR. MORRISON;

2

That, cf course, is one step

3

this side of the Ohralik case where the Court was faced

4

with in-person solicitation ty a lawyer of a recent

5

accident victim while in the hospital.
My own view is that in person solicitation is

6

7

not necessarily something that can be prohibited or that

8

ouaht to be prohibited.

9

there are substantial potential dangers from in-perscn

Nonetheless, I recognize that

10

solicitation'in the form of overreaching, in the form of

11

persuading a person to sign a piece of paper that would

12

retain

13

the lawyer at that particular time
Ky own view would be that it would be very

14

important for the Court to explore other alternatives in

15

determining whether the absolute prohibition applied,

16

but I think that there is a clear line both in terms of

17

evidentiary basis for determining what the lawyer said

18

as opposed to -- as opposed to a written matter where

19

there is no problem.

20

QUESTION;

With respect to the clear line,

21

which side cf the line would the case fall on if instead

22

of a general ad like this you had a mailing list and you

23

had about 25 people’s names on it?

24
25

MR. MORRISON;

I believe that a mailing list

is constitutionally protected.

ME. MOREISON :

It is, but indeed, if Mr.

Zauderer had Xeroxed the ad which he had here and he

knew,

5

6

Shield IUDs, although in this case it is not clear how

7

he would do that, tut he simply engaged in test mailing,

8

he sent it to Occupant at such and such an address, it

9

seems to me hard to understand how the fact that it was

fcr instance, or he simply — he knew, for

10

a -- it came in a Xeroxed envelope, in an envelope as

11

These,

particularly, I submit, you are never going to see
information like that in an advertisement because that
is not the kind of realistic assessment that is going to
bring somebody into your office.
Furthermore, if this advertising is generally
all ewe d and becomes a common competitive tool, you are
not going to see any lawyers give legal advice which is
less optimistic about people’s claims than the advice
given by other lawyers in their advertisements.

There

is an example in New York for a recent case which New
York in fact upheld, although it was attacked on a
different basis, where someone wrote to victims of a
particular accident and said the liability of the
defendants is clear.
Now, I submit that the next lawyer who writes
to the same potential groups of plaintiffs, group cf
potential plaintiffs, is not going to say no, you should
sign on with me, I am doubtful about the liability cf
the defendants.
This use, therefore, will not only have an
effect on the legal advice itself, but it will make it
harder for a lawyer, having enticed the client in in the
first place, then to later inform him that perhaps the
claims are not. meretorious and should be dropped.
Now, in combatting these evils, .Chic, as I

exactly what rhis Court has encouraged in other cases.

NR. FARR:

7

Nc, I think what the government's

8

interest here is preventing people from using incomplete

9

information to bring people into the lawyer’s office,

10

and what they are saying here is that if you are going

11

to get into this subject as part'of a lure to get

12

people -- and contingent fee arrangements, of course,

13

are part of the lure -- that you simply have to give

it ?
But

23

I think the risk that they are aiming at is something

24

different than that, and I think this rule can provide

25

at least three kind of information.

First of all, it

40
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

puts potential clients on notice that there is such a

2

thing as fees and costs that they may he responsible

3

for, and I think this is particularly important because

4

it will undercut the notion that litigation at its worst

5

is just a free ride.

6

quite craftily, if no recovery is had, no legal fees are

7

owed by cur clients.

8

costs, maybe substantial costs, may be owed.

This ad, for example, says I think

Eut of course, the fact is that

Secondly, it puts people on notice that even

9
10

if you

win your lawsuit, what you recover may be eaten

11

up largely, entirely or more than entirely, by

12

contingent fees and costs, and that is particularly

13

true, of course, if the contingent fee is calculated

14

before the costs are deducted.
And finally, it allows consumers to compare

15
16

more readily among people who advertise contingent fee

17

rates.
Now, here, because it is possible to do sc,

18
19

the state has aimed at the problem not by banning

20

discussion of contingent fees in advertisements, but

21

simply

22

by requiring mere sceech.
So Appellant here was not faced with the

23

problem that faced the appellants in Eates, which is a

24

choice between no speech and some speech.

25

Court said in Bates, that is the preferred remedy.
QUESTION:

2

Mr. Farr, Ohio has a separate rule

3

prohibiting illustrations other than those named, does

4

it not?

5

MR. FARR:

That is correct, Justice O’Conner.

6

QUESTION:

And what do you assert is the

7

state's interest in prohibiting illustrations that are

8

accurate, which don’t fall within the two or three that

9

are permitted, the legal scales and the photograph of

10
11

the la wyer?
MR. FARR:

I think what the state is aiming at

12

in those cases or what the state is doing in those cases

13

is based on two assumptions:

14

as lawyer advertising goes, that it is the rare case

15

that a photograph or an illustration adds any necessary

16

information about legal services, and I think —

17
18

QUESTION:

first of all, that as far

Well, of course, it is alleged that

this is that rare case.

19

MR. FARR:

That’s correct.

20

QUESTION:

Now, what is the state's interest

21

22

in prohibiting an accurate illustration of this type?
MR. FARR:

I think the state's interest is

23

that it cannot look at every illustration on a

24

case-by-case basis.

25

the administrative mechanism to do that, and I think it

I don't think that the state has

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

would get into the kinds of subjective judgments that

2

are difficult, and I think in fact unfortunate for a

3

state tc make.
So I think what the state is saying is it is

4

5

the rare case where this will be necessary information.

6

In many cases, use of pictures will be abused, and we do

7

not have to make a case by case examination.

Hew is the administrative burden

any different than it would be in reviewing ads

generally?

12

in a way that would justify the restriction?

I just don’t see hew that adds to the burden

MB. FARR*

13

Well, I think it adds tc the burden

14

in the sense that first of all, to the extent that

15

information in ads simply contains the material that is

16

included and that is allowed by the Ohio ads, I don't

17

think

there is a great burden in reviewing that.

18

think

-- so what you are saying in the area of the

19

photographs I believe is that the possibility that we

20

may have a photograph that actually does communicate

21

useful information necessitates our going through all

22

photographs in order tc identify which ones those are.

23

And I think that is the kind of -- that 's the reason

24

that you have prophylactic rules in the first place, so

25

that you don’t have to make those kinds of case-by-case

a ban on a certain form of communicating information.

6

conceivably trade names would not in a particular case

7

mislead the public.

8

decided, and this Court said it could legitimtely

9

decide, is that in those cases, the risk is high enough

10

and the need is low enough because there are other ways

11

of communicating the same information, that we are going

12

to have a general ban on trade names, and the Court

13

upheld

it.

The fact that you cannot review

QUESTION;

Mr. Farr, I can’t resist asking you

24

about the series of exhibits that the Ohio State Far

25

Association itself put out with all the illustrations

violations of the rule.
MR. FARR;

3

There are gross

That’s right, and I think if the

4

Ohio Bar -- if an individual practitioner in order to

5

draw business to himself put those ads in, you would

6

have a different set of risks, and that that would he

QUESTION;

8
9

You would have a much more serious

violation, I suppose, than we do even in this case, tut

10

are you really persuaded that those ads that are put

11

there are really contrary to public interest, that

12

whole —

13

MR. FARR;

I'm sorry, which ads?

QUESTION;

The ones at the back of the joint

21

Each has a picture, each has some isolated bit of

Do you think those are really extremely
harmful ads that should be prohibited?
NR. FARR:

What I do believe, which I think is

22

responsive to your question, Justice Stevens, is that

23

ads giving legal advice as part of a selling pitch for

24

individual lawyers are definitely harmful to the public

25

interest, yes.

interest?
ME. FARR:

8
9

That's contrary to the public

What I am suggesting is that there

may be some ads which do provide a benefit to the public

10

interest, but the overwhelming burden is the other way,

11

that in general, once this particular use of legal

12

advice is allowed to be used as the selling tool, that

13

the public interest will definitely be harmed on

14

balance, and even the cases might prove helpful are

15

outweighed by it.
QUFSTION;

16

I think your most persuasive

17

argument on that point is that the advice is apt to

18

become

19

apt to be misleading advice because you are going to

20

give the more optimistic rather than the pessimistic

21

view of the case.

-- it is no longer disinterested and therefore

Justice White suggested, is confined to matters as to

QUESTION;

Well, I guess it -- the part ahcut

13

the touting doesn't really apply there, that touting

might cause the advice to be misleading.

MR. FARR;

That's right, that's rioht.

16

Now, what I am saying is that I think that the
f

17

risks are there in any ad.

Now, it may be possible that

18

there is an area that could be carved out definiticnally

19

for ads, the legal advice about which nobody could

One, I question how you would define that, and

21

22

secondly, I very much question how you could ever
