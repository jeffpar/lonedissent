ORAL ARGUMENT OF DAVID AARON STRAUSS, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. STRAUSS:

Thank you, Mr.

In 1981 Albertini, without seeking permission,

10
11

reentered Hickham.

He reentered during the base's

12

annual open house.

Now, during the open house, portions

13

of the base are open to the public and members of the

14

public do not need passes to enter those portions of the

15

base .

16

And the Air Force puts on various displays and

17

exhibitions designed to show the civilian members of the

18

surrounding communities what goes on behind the normally

closed gates of the base.

And

1

after having been ordered not to do so.

2

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

3

reversed Albertini's conviction, holding that it was

4

unconstitutional under the First Amendment to apply

5

Section 1382 in these circumstances.

6

Notably, there is scant mention in the Ninth

7

Circuit's opinion of the fact that Albertini had

8

received the bar letter.

9

undertook

a

Instead, the Ninth Circuit

relatively lengthy analysis of the question

10

whether Hickham, on the day of the open house, was a

11

public forum such that members of the public had a right

12

to demonstrate there.

13

After answering that question in the

14

affirmative, the Ninth Circuit concluded in a relatively

15

cursory discussion that it was immaterial that Albertini

16

was the holder of a bar letter.

17

Now, we sought certiorari because we believe

18

that the Court of Appeals' decision had unjustifiably

19

undermined what this Court has referred to as the

20

historically unquestioned power of a commanding officer

21

to exclude civilians from the area of his command, and

22

because we thought the Court of Appeals'

23

constitutional holding jeopardized the military's open

24

house program,

25

view — effort by the Air Force and the Navy to improve

2

communities.

3

In its order granting our petition, the court

4

requested the parties to address the question whether

5

Respondent's attendance at the open house was the kind

6

of reentry that Congress intended to prohibit in Section

7

1382.
Our submission is that the plain language of

Section 1382 is sufficient to answer that question in

our favor.

elements.

12

within a military installation after having been ordered

13

not to reenter is guilty of an offense.

14

Section 1382 has essentially three
It provides that whoever reenters or is found

Now,

in any ordinary sense of the words,

15

Respondent reentered Hickham in 1981. And if there is

16

any doubt about that, then there is certainly no doubt

17

that in the ordinary sense of the words he was found

18

within Hickham in 1981.

19

Respondent has never contended that Hickham is

20

anything other than a military installation.

21

Respondent admitted at trial in his testimony and

22

continues to admit that he received a bar letter.

23

QUESTION:

Mr.

Strauss,

And

I guess the Respondent

24

takes the position in his brief that the bar letter is

25

stale and no longer valid.

I

suppose even if the Court

6

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

were to agree with your position end reverse, that issue

2

would be open on remand?

3

MR. STRAUSS:

4

QUESTION:

That's right, Justice O'Connor.

You do agree, do you, that a bar

5

letter can be become stale.

6

your papers; do you still --

7

MR. STRAUSS:

8

QUESTION:

9
10

You did at one point in

Yes, we do.

We don't always follow the plain

language.
MR. STRAUSS:

I think the limitation on the

11

duration of a bar letter is found not in Section 1382,

12

but in the requirement that administrative actions be

13

reasonable.

14
15
16
17
18

And therefore, a bar letter cannot extend
beyond a reasonable time, and that is the limitation.
QUESTION:

Do you have any idea what the

Government's position is on a reasonable time?
MR. STRAUSS:

I think it would necessarily

19

depend on circumstances of each case.

20

think it is quite clear just from what we know in his

21

record, which was not even developed with an eye toward

22

establishing a reasonableness of enforcing this bar

23

letter, that it was reasonable to enforce it against

24

Respondent who, only two months before he reentered

25

Hickham for the open house, had engaged in what he

1

himself described as a clear-cut case of civil

2

disobedience that involved a sensitive area of another

3

base on Hawaii.

4

QUESTION:

Was a bar letter then — the

5

justification is something he did elsewhere, over at

6

Camp Smith?

7

MR.

STRAUSS:

The justification could be

8

something he did elsewhere.

If he had committed some

9

minor disdeed in 1972 and had done nothing between 1972

10

and 1981,

11

argument that it would be unreasonble to apply the bar

12

letter to him in 1981.

13

I would agree that he would have a very strong

But nothing like that is the case.

His act in

14

1972 was quite serious, and by his own admission, quite

15

apart from anything we might show where we put to the

16

test of proving reasonableness, he committed a series of

17

illegal entries and acts of civil disobedience between

18

1972 and 1971, which furnished reasonable ground for

19

extending the bar letter.

20

QUESTION:

May I just ask, because there's

21

reference to the March incident,

22

Hickham Air Force Base?

23
24
25

MR. STRAUSS:

is Camp Smith part of

My understanding is it's a

separate — it's a separate installation.
QUESTION:

So that even if there was such a

that wouldn't really apply to this

MR. STRAUSS:

He was — he had a bar letter

from Camp Smith as well as from Hickham.

5

QUESTION:

In

'72.

And then you also mention

6

in your brief, and they say it's outside the record, and

7

I was a little puzzled about it, that in March of

8

there was a bar letter mailed that he said was returned

9

or he didn't get, or something like that.

10
11
12

But that would be from Camp Smith, but not
Hickham?
MR. STRAUSS:

No.

Hickham sent him, as a

13

result of his actions at Camp Smith, the commander of

14

Hickham sent him another bar letter in March of 1981.

one,

it would be very herd to say it had died.

2

MR.

STRAUSS:

Well,

I think that's right,

3

although I certainly don't think it should be necessary

4

for a new commander to go through the formality of

5

reissuing all bar letters on file when he takes office.
QUESTION:

6

Did the Defendant in this case —

7

it was a bench trial, wasn't it?

8

MR. STRAUSS:

9

QUESTION:

That's right.

Did the Defendant make any argument

10

to the District Court as to the staleness of the bar

11

letter?
MR. STRAUSS:

12

He moved before trial to dismiss

13

the indictment on the ground that the bar letter was

14

stale.

15

the premise that the bar letter was sufficient.

16

That motion was denied and the case was tried on

QUESTION:

Does the record offer any

17

explanation as to why the second bar letter was returned

18

to the sender?

19

MR. STRAUSS:

The only explanation is

20

Respondent's statement when he Was asked did you get a

21

bar letter for your actions in March

22

never received one; no.

'81, and he said I

23

That is the state of the record.

24

QUESTION:

25

Any question as to the correctness

of the address?
10

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

MR. STRAUSS:

Not that I know of, although I

2

have to say those matters were not gone into this record

3

because it was assumed that the early bar letter Was

4

sufficient.

5

That would, of course, bear on the

6

reasonableness of applying the earlier bar letter to

7

Respondent in '81.

8

9

QUESTION:

May I just ask you to comment on

one other aspect of this?

If the Government

10

acknowledges, as I think you did in response to Justice

11

O'Connor, that there is an issue open on remand as to

12

the staleness, possible staleness of the bar letter, why

13

should that issue not be resolved before we go forward

14

and address th constitutional question?

15

MR.

STRAUSS:

It's quite possible, and in fact

16

I can see no reason why the Court of Appeals should not

17

have resolved it before it addressed the constitutional

18

question.

19

I would point out, though,

that if the Court

20

of Appeals' constitutional holding stands, not only Can

21

we not retry Respondent, which is not the case if it's

22

merely found that the bar letter was stale in this

23

record, but that has quite serious implications for the

24

open house program elsewhere in the Ninth Circuit which

25

is now constitutionally precluded from keeping off bar

letter holders who want to demonstrate.

2

QUESTION:

Mr. Strauss,

is there any procedure

3

at the base on open house days to try to exclude from

4

those who are coming in holders of bar letters?
MR. STRAUSS:

5

My understanding, Justice

6

Brennan,

7

letter holders from entering, so many people come on the

8

base during the open house,

lucky and spots someone whom he knows to have a bar

is that while the base regulations forbid bar

QUESTION:

11

Well,

if there's no procedure at

12

all,

I wonder about your argument that it's necessary to

13

prevent serious security risks.
MR. STRAUSS:

14

Well, this is an instance,

15

Justice Brennan,

in which we have to rely principally on

16

the possible deterrent effect and on people's

17

willingness to obey the law rather than on being able to

18

pluck these people from the stream of entrants onto the

19

base .
It may also be that there are other

20
21

circumstancs in which bases do not have so many people

22

and can screen.

additional basis for prosecuting someone if he does

QUESTION:

Incidentally, now that I have you

2

interrupted, the Court of Appeals relied on Flower

3

rather heavily, didn't it?

4

MR. STRAUSS:

5

QUESTION:

That's right.

And do I correctly now read your

6

brief — I looked back at your brief in Flower, and you

7

didn't concede the unconstitutionality of the bar letter

8

in that case at that time when we decided Flower.

9
10

Do I now read you as conceding that the use of
the bar letter in Flower was unconstitutional?

11

MR. STRAUSS:

We understand that to be the

12

burden of the Court's holding in Flower, and we accept

13

the Court's enlightenment on that.

4

to run through a military base.
That's not the case here.

5

It was, for all

This was still very

6

much a military base, even though it had large numbers

7

of civilians on it.

8

And the other distinction is that —

9

QUESTION:

Well, excuse me.

Was that the

10

reason that you suggest in your brief now that there

11

they were engaged in constitutionally protected activity?

12

MR. STRAUSS:

13

QUESTION:

14

MR. STRAUSS:

15

QUESTION:

No,

that's the additional —

That's additional.
Well --

But you also, at page 35 of your

16

brief,

if I read you correctly -- perhaps I don't -- I

17

thought you were conceding there that a person Can't be

18

prosecuted on the basis of a bar letter that was issued

19

because he engaged in constitutionally protected

20

activity.

21

I'm reading from your brief.

22

MR. STRAUSS:

Yes,

that is the other — that

23

is the second way in which Flowers differs from this

24

case .

25

MR. STRAUSS:

Our view for the issue — for

18

the reasons we explained in a somewhat lengthy footnote

19

in our brief -- are that they did not have a First

20

Amendment right to demonstrate during the open house.

21

Th situation was sufficiently comparable to Greer v.

22

Spock that the military should not be put in the

23

position of having to referee between possibly competing

24

groups of demonstrators on its own base.

MR. STRAUSS:

They did, Justice Brennan.

The

testimony at trial was that that was something done by

4

the desk clerk, although I have to say that when we were

preparing --

6

QUESTION:

Well, wasn't there also testimony

that the officer who detained him had been told to stop

8

the activities of persons carrying "anti-defense

10

MR. STRAUSS:

The commanding officer told the

12

there is some anti-defense demonstrating going on;

please do something about it.

Doesn't that smack of prosecuting

MR. STRAUSS:

I

don't think there is sufficient evidence that he was —

that anyone was apprehended for that reason.

Incidentally, Albertini had been on

MR.

25

MR.

He even taught there.

He says that he had been on and

off the base several times;

24

I think it

that's right.

Well, didn't he teach there?

STRAUSS:

According to his testimony.
16

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC,
20 F ST„ N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

We

1

have no record that he ever taught there.

2

he taught there.

3

that he ever reentered the base with the permission of

4

the commander or anyone else on the base.

5

But he says

He never -- what he did not say was

He simply, to judge from his testimony,

10

isn't that

in?

11

MR. STRAUSS:

I think clearly not, Justice

12

Brennan.

13

from the bar letter that the purpose of the written

14

permission requirement is to explain to the recipient

15

that he's in a different category from the general

public;

17

public, he has to obtain written permission to enter.

18

I think the entire -- it's perfectly clear

that whatever might be true of the general

Respondent's two arguments on the statutory

issue in addition to the one about the staleness, the

other argument Respondent makes is that Section 1382

didn't apply because Hickham was open to the public

during the open house.
The problem with this argument has come out to

some extent in my colloquy with Justice Marshall,

is

10

that many bases are always open to the public.

QUESTION:

And

That was the — those were the

15

abuses, the limited abuses which led Congress to enact

the statute;

right?

MR. STRAUSS:

Those were the specific things

18

that gave rise to the statute, although even Respondent

19

eschews any argument that you have to show that a person

20

was on the base in order to promote drinking or

21

prostitution in order to issue him a bar letter.

never suggested otherwise, that he can be issued a bar

a matter of fixed policy, has not allowed any indefinite

bar letters or indeed any that last longer than three

more than nine years before the 1981 open house.

taken by the Court of Appeals below that we have to

address,

isn't it?
MR. SIMS:

Well, Your Honor, assuming for the

5

moment that O'Brien is the right analysis, and the

6

Government suggests that it is,

7

and I would focus my argument on four criterion of

8

O'Brien -- whether the enforcement of bar letters

generally is greater than essential to fulfilling the

the relevant question —

Government's interests.

But if I could,

I'd

19

like to touch briefly on the scienter question because I

20

think it's plain that Congress intended to prohibit

21

reentry only in violation of a -- only a knowing

22

violation of an operative violator.

23

Again, every court prior to this

Case

24

required the Government to shoulder that burden.

25

this case, as I've indicated, the District Court

has
In

expressly held that such proof was not required, and it

2

made no finding in that regard.

3

Now,

both the United States Gypsum and the

4

Moriissette case make plain that the lower courts which

5

have unanimously required knowledge of an operative

6

order not to enter have correctly construed the

7

statute.

8
9

Morissette is particularly relevant.

There,

the Court held that no crime had been committed where a

10

defendant who collected spent shell case things on a

11

base believed they were abandoned, even in fact they

12

hadn't been legally abandoned.

13

no crime was committed if the Defendant believed that

14

the bar letter had been effectively abandoned by the

15

miltary, whether or not that belief is legally correct.

16

In this case similarly,

Now, as I have indicated,

the testimony is

17

that this man taught college courses on this base, had

18

conducted tours on the base, he had receipt of an

19

invitation in the newspapers and the radio inviting

20

everyone, without exception.

21

He knew of a recent decision of the District

22

Court there, Butler v. United States,

23

by President Nixon to the base which had appeared to

hold that when the base is open to the public for this

kind of an event, the public can come on, without

may have missed it, but in response to Justice Rehnquist

11

knowledge was totally irrelevant?
MR.

That's correct, Your Honor.

The

case does not come here on a finding that he believed it

13

was effective.

14

that that knowledge is irrelevant.

15

The case comes on a legal determination

QUESTION:

And the Court of Appeals not only

didn't decide the staleness question, but also didn't

decide that question.

18

MR. SIMS:

non-constitutional issues they bypassed in order to

the Government has brought this case here,

that this was a public forum and arguing that O'Brien

nevertheless requires that the conviction be affirmed,

that

SIMS:

Well, let me turn in a more focused

to the bar letter practice which I think makes plain
O'Brien doesn't cover this case.
Bar letters are issued, as we have indicated

13

in some detail in the brief, in extremely broad manner.

14

At some bases they're issued for all less-than-honorable

15

discharges, so that, for example, all homosexual —

16

people who are homosexual servicemen would get barred.

17

There's a regulation which apparently

contemplates the issuance of bar letters against people

who are misusing recreational jeep and snowmobiles on

military property.

QUESTION:

This bar letter was not for

purposes such as that, however.

8

that analysis in Taxpayers for Vincent and Grace,

9

whether or not the enforcement of this content neutral

rule is broader than necessary to fulfill the

11

Government's interest.
Now,

12

And the

is

in Clark and Taxpayers for Vincent,

in

13

finding the O'Brien test was essentially satisfied, the

14

Court was able to find that the O'Brien test was

absolutely satisfied because the determination of the

Court was that every additional demonstration overnight

17

or every additional sign was a marginal addition to the

18

precise evil that the Government had a right to

19

terminate, the esthetic evil, the protection of the

20

parks.

21

In this Case on the other hand,

if the

Government is correct that bar letters generally can be

enforced at open houses, there is no such focused

On the facts of this case, therefore, we think

13

it's clear that the Respondents were subjected to 1382

14

because the commander objected to what was being said

and with the objectives of their protest.

the relevance of the

the anti-defense character of their speech.

In cases even where the Court has found no

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER
MR. STRAUSS:

REBUTTAL

We brought the case here because

3

of the First Amendment issue, and it's our view that

4

that's the only issue that the Court need resolve and

5

should resolve.

6

As I said, the staleness question will be open

7

on remand, and before Respondent's position on that

8

question could possibly be accepted, we think we have

9

several substantial arguments that would have to be

10

considered.

11

that Respondent was entitled simply to ignore his bar

12

letter and go ahead and violate it.

13

For example,

it's not at all clear to us

If he thought it was stale, the bar letter

14

itself told him what he should do;

15

permission of the commanding officer.

16

commanding officer refused him permission,

17

challenge that decision which we concede is reviewable

18

in court under a properly deferential standard.

19

QUESTION:

And if the
he could then

May I ask you about the other

20

statutory issue, the intent issue.

21

your opponent's interpretation of the record that the

22

District Court ruled as a matter of law that intent was

23

irrelevant?

24
25

MR. STRAUSS:
Justice Stevens.

No,

Do you agree with

I disagree with that,

On page 41 of the Joint Appendix, the
54

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

District Court stated that the intent that is needed is

2

the intent present in intentionally and voluntarily and

3

knowingly entering the base and not stepping across a

4

line unwittingly.

5

Respondent conceded that he knew he had a bar

6

letter and that he knew he was on a military base.

7

our view is that is the intent;

8
9

QUESTION:

And

that it's --

What if -- just assume that the

other court might have taken the view that the Defendant

10

had to be aware of the fact that the bar letter had not

11

become stale and that he did convince the judge — just

12

assume it for a moment — that he had gone on several

13

times and therefore reasonably assumed that it was no

14

longer in effect, that there's a policy of three-year

15

bar letters and so forth.

16

Would that not present an issue of law that

17

ought to be decided before the conviction is finally

18

final?

19

MR. STRAUSS:

It would present an issue of

20

law.

21

One is that I'm not sure it was preserved on appeal.

22

don't think it was among the issued raised on appeal by

23

Respondent.

24
25

I would have two points to make, Justice Stevens.
I

And the other is that while it is an issue of
law,

I think the answer is extremely obvious, that a
55

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

1

defendant in a criminal case, especially in a

2

prosecution under a statute like this, does not have a

3

reasonable mistake defense,

4

Fitzgerald defense, that while he actually -- his

5

conduct was illegal, he has the substantial argument

6

that it was not illegal, and therefore he should escape

7

from the liability.

QUESTION:

a sort of Harlow v.

Even if — in other words,

there's

no distinction between what in fact is reasonable and
what he might have thought was reasonable in your view?
MR.

11

STRAUSS:

The question whether

it was

12

reasonable to continue the bar letter in force is an

13

objective legal question to be determined on all the

14

facts.

15

continue it in force, then Respondent is liable, and the

16

fact that he has a substantial argument in the other

17

direction is not a means for him to escape from the

18

liability.

19

If

it's determined that it was reasonable to

I know of no such principle in the law, and

20

certainly there's no reason to think Congress wanted

21

every defendant prosecuted under Section 1382 to be abl

22

to say in his defense, well,

23

24

reason, and this reason I thought that perhaps my

25

conduct was legal.

I know I violated the

And if his view was in good faith,
56

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

1

he would escape punishment.

2

that that was Congress's intent.

There's no reason to think

3

But as I say, these are the sorts of issues

4

including the question of whether that issue was even

5

preserved on appeal, that quite clearly we think should

6

be sorted out in the Court of Appeals on remand and not

by this Court at this time.
