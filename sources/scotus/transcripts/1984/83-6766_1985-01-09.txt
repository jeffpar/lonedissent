I’d maintain that it is still a

16

I find in Davis v.

17

that although the — what happened here, the district

court said this is the question left open by Davis, in

19

the opinion of, I believe, Mr. Justice Brennan, that the

20

court could conceive of situations wherein fingerprints

22

to do so.

In the wake of Davis, a number of states

passed statutes wherein under very circumscribed

circumstances, the police could go to a magistrate and

get what — I called it a mini-warrant in the brief —

prints.

MR. RAIDEN:

13

I think arguably there is a

problem.

16

had been passed in the wake of Davis.

17

that in light of more recent cases such as Dunaway v.

18

New York and Royer v. Florida that whatever might have

19

been suggested in the Davis opinion, that it could be

20

done without probable cause, it probably no longer is

21

constitutionally valid, and that probable cause would be

22

required any time you wanted to move someone, detain,

23

someone for that length of time.

MR. RAIDEN;

When they say in Terry that you

may ask identity, I’m not sure the purpose of inquiring

into identity is evidentiary in nature.

MR. RAIDER:

5

What I detect in Place and Royer,

6

Mr. Justice Rehnguist, is an element of exigency,

7

although I don’t find that specific word in the

8

opinions, because of the fact that these people come and

9

go in airports.

10

And if you don't find out what you're

looking for right now, it's gone forever.
QUESTION:

11

But --

Well, the decision announced by

12

this Court yesterday in Hensley permitted a Terry-type

13

stop just for identification purposes based on a flyer.

14

Now, if fingerprinting on the scene were used for

15

identification, how does that differ?
MR. RAIDER:

16

As I understood the opinion that

17

you announced yesterday, first of all, there had already

18

been an arrest warrant for the individual; is that

That is not correct.

He, was —

22

the reason they wanted to find his identification is to

find out if he was the person wanted.

I was mistaken,
