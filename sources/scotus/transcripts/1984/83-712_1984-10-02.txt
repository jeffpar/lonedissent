MR. NODES:

We will hear arguments

the Ccurt,

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

10

argued before this Ccurt that the Fourth Amendment

11

exclusionary rule should be held inapplicable to school

12

searches conducted by school teachers and school

13

ad ministrators.
Following argument, this Ccurt requested

14
15

additional briefing and argument on the issue of whether

16

under

17

case the vice principal's search of the student's purse

18

violated the Fourth Amendment at all.

We suggest that there was no ccnstituticra1

We argue firstly that the

And we believe that the standard which should

18

be applied to school searches should be lower than

19

probable cause, and in fact should be a standard cf

20

reasonable' suspicion.

21

QUESTION;

Mr. Nodes, assuming the

22

applicability of the Fourth Amendment, do you think

23

on this record there was prcbable cause for the search?

24
25

MR. NODES:

bes,

I dc, Your Fence.

that

I believe

that what we had in this case was an instance where a

4

1

person who was very, very reputable witnessed an action

2

which was a violation of a school regulation.

3

reported this violation to another person, who is also

4

reputable.

He

Sow, what he said was, he saw a cigarette in a

5

6

person’s hand, and I believe that it is pure common

7

sense to believe that when cne sees a cigarette in a

8

person's hand, that that person will also be carrying

9

cigarettes in a pack somewhere on their person.

10

Sc,

I --

11

QUESTION*

Or, that the person is holding it

12

in the hand because they intend to smoke it or are

13

smoking it?

Because they are going to smoke it?

MR. NODES*

14

Yes.

The fact that they have the

15

cigarette indicates firstly that they are smoking it,

16

secondly, that they have cigarettes, and I believe that

17

that is all the vice principal actually needed in this

18

cas e.
QUESTION*

19

Well,

Er.

Node, assuming again the

20

applicability of the Fourth Amendment, if you are right

21

that there was probable cause shown here, why should we

22

address the question whether something less would

23

satisfy?

24
25

MR. NODES*

Well, I believe for two reasons.

Firstly, I don’t believe that it is settled that

5

1

probable cause should te the standard tc which schccl

2

teachers should te held.

3

New Jersey Supreme Court found that there wasn't

4

probable cause and there wasn’t even reasonable

5

suspicion, even though we argued all along that probable

6

cause was present.

7

In this case, of course, the

The mere fact that we have met the highest

8

possible standard, cr that we argue that we have met the

9

highest possible standard which could be enunciated does

10

not mean that this Court could not set forth the

11

appropriate standard for lower courts to follow in

12

future cases.

13

I believe that --

14

QUESTION:

Or that this Court could disagree

15

with you that there was probable cause in this

16

particular case.

17

MB. NODES:

Very clearly this Ccurt could

18

disagree with that, and then it would be necessary tc

19

determine what lower standard would apply and whether cr

20

not we had met that lower standard.

21
22
23
24
25

QUESTION;
It was no smoking,

What was the rule of the school?
right?

MR. NODES:

There were school rules that there

was no smoking in certain areas.
QUESTION:

T.L.O. —

And she was' smoking in that area?

6

1

MR. NODES;

2

QUESTION;

3

Yes, that is correct.
Isn't that the end of the case?

Why do you have to go and search?

4

MR. NODES;

Well,

I think that, Ycur Hcncr,

5

the reason why we did go and search, and it may very

6

well be that we did not have tc gc and search, tut the

7

reason that we did go and search was that the principal

8

was trying tc be fair tc the student.

9

merely accepting the word of the teacher who said,

10

I saw

two students smoking, he had a —

11

QUESTION;

Well,

suppose that the teacher

12

reported that the child had cursed.

13

enough?

14

it, would you?

Would that be

You wouldn’t have tc get additional proof fcr

MR. NODES;

16

Bather than

No, I don’t believe that it world

be necessary to get additional proof.

QUESTION;

MR.

19

QUESTION;

20

MR. NODES;

Why dc you need extra proof here?

NODES;

I don’t believe that we had -Well, didn’t she deny it?
I do net believe we had to have

21

additional proof here.

22

wrong fcr us to obtain additional proof.
QUESTION;

23

That does not mean that it is

Well, I am just raising the

24

question.

Is it necessary tc violate somebody's rights

25

in order to add on to the necessary ingredients fcr

7

MR. NODES;

2

No,

would net advocate

violating somebody's rights in order to add additional

QUESTION;

5

I can understand -- you didn’t need

6

to search to get the -- I don’t mean conviction, the

7

action of the school board.

search.
MR. NODES;

You didn’t need the

tie could have -- the vice

10

principal could have disciplined T.L.C. without the

11

search.

12

somebody’s rights in order to get additional evidence.

13

I believe that the vice ' priroipal was atle to get the

14

additional evidence with absolutely no violation of the

15

person * s rights.

16

I do net agree that we had to violate

What the vice principal ended up doing was

mandatory, but appropriate then --

QUESTION;

she wasn’t smoking?

What is the defense to -- because

MR. NODES;

The defense was a total denial of

smoking, and the additional element --

3

QUESTION!

4

MR. NODES;

Did she say that?
-- that she couldn’t have leer

5

smoking then because she never smoked at all.

6

believe that by demonstrating whether or not this person

7

smoked, the vice principal had a much better idea of

8

whether cr net she was smoking cn that particular

occasi on .

10

And I

Yes, the vice principal could have said tc

11

T.L.O, T.I.C., I am going tc believe the teacher, whe is

12

totally credible, and I am going to assume without

13

checking anything that you are lying tc me.

14

vice principal tried to act more reasonably than that.

15

I thirk the

I think the vice principal tried to ensure

16

that the school regulations were followed, but at the

17

same time was also trying tc ensure that a possibly

18

innocent person wasn’t punished.

19

action of that type should be condoned rather than

20

criticized .

21

QUESTION;

And I think that an

All I can say is, schools are

different from when — when I went to

was in school.
MR. NODES;

9

I never got one hearing the whole

But this Court has now decreed

10

that in certain circumstances there will be at least

11

limited hearings, and I think that this is what the vice

12

principal followed .

13

before imposing discipline, and he didn't just give a

14

pro forma hearing and at the end of the hearing say,

15

okay,

16

He did give a limited hearing

new I am going to ignore what you said.
He checked what the juvenile had said, and he

17

checked what the juvenile said, in an extremely

18

reasonable manner, because we believe that at the very

19

least he had a reasonable suspicion that an infraction

20

had occurred, and that evidence of the infraction --

21

QUESTION:

May I ask you, in the prior

22

argument you seemed to accept the standard that the New

23

Jersey Supreme Court laid down.

24

you still do or not.

MR. NODES:

9

QUESTION:

10

That is not my question.

Do I accept the standard That they laid down.
Nc, I do not.
I didn't think -- you have changed

ycur position, haven't you?

11

MR. NODES:

I think that that is a proper

12

interpretation.

I believe that the name reasonable

13

interpretation is an appropriate name for a standard.
QUESTICN:

14

But the question,

I suppose, is

15

reasonable suspicion of what, and in ycur

16

it Is a suspicion of any violation of any school

17

regulation would justify a search, whereas they say it

18

has to be suspicion of a crime or of something, a major

19

disorder.

20
21

22
23
24
25

view I gather

Is that right?
MR. NODES:

No.

I believe that they said

crime or violation of school disciplinary regulations.
QUESTION:

Would seriously interfere with

school discipline or order.
MR. NODES:

Yes, I don't think that first of

all it would have to be a serious infringement, and

QUESTION;

3

MR. NODES;

Sc you disagree with that part.
Sc I disagree with that part/ but

4

mere than that, I disagree with their application cf the

5

announced standard to this case.

6

QUESTION;

I understand, but you also do

7

disagree with their standard.

8

I take it, that if there was reasonable suspicion that

9

the purse contained, say, a note or a diary or something

You would take the view,

10

that would disclose a violation of any rule, the rule

11

requiring students to be on time for athletic games or

12

something like that, they could still search?

13
14
15

MR. NODES;

I think that you have to evaluate

the need for the evidence and whether or not -QUESTION;

Well, the purpose is exactly the

16

same, to find out if there is evidence of infraction of

17

a school regulation that does not involve harm, physical -

18

harm or anything like that, just the child may have teen

19

late to school.

20

Could they search to determine that?

MR. NODES;

Yes,

I believe that they cculd,

21

provided that student is carrying that diary and that

22

information with them.

23

constitutionally permissible.

24

QUESTION;

25

I believe that that would be

Mr. Nodes, would

ycu believe that

if a reasonable suspicion standard is

applied, that it

12

1

would have justified a strip search cf the pupil in this

2

cas e?
KR . NODES:

3

I believe that when we are dealing

4

with what we are classifying generally as school

5

searches, we are talking about searches which would

6

normally be made for violations of school regulations

7

and school disciplines rather than law enforcement

8

search es.
QUESTION;

9

What standard do we apply to

10

determine the validity of the search, assuming one is

11

authorized?

How far can you go in the search?

HE. NODES;

12

1 believe that a search cf, fcr

13

instance, lockers,

items which a person carries into

14

school, cr searches cf clothing or. pockets would be

15

within the normal area which a teacher under the normal

16

functions cf a teacher could search.
QUESTION;

17

I believe --

Dc you think then that a male

18

teacher could conduct a- pat-down search of a ycung wcman

19

student at age 16

to find the cigarettes?

KR . NODES:

20

I believe that that would be

21

constitutionally permissible.

I would note .that as in

22

the area with airplane searches and with most police

23

searches, if it can be avoided, that simply is net

24

done.

25

occur.

I don’t expect that that is something which would

13

Now, if that does occur, if there is a

1

2

pat-dowr cf a female by a male teacher cr administrator,

3

or if there is a strip search, and that search is for

4

anything except a constitutionally permissible purpose,

5

if there is any evidence of harassment cr anything cf

6

that type, cf course, other actions can be brought,

7

same as they could against --

8

QUESTION:

9

the

Well, do you concede that there

would be a further requirement in any event that the

10

extent of the search itself would have to be reasonable

11

under

12

the child and the circumstances?

13

the circumstances considering the age and sex cf

MR. NODES:

Yes, I would agree with that.

I

14

would agree that we are not advocating strip searches of

15

students to find out whether or not they have been

16

smoking cigarettes, and I dcn’t think that that is what

17

is normally held to be a school search, a-nd in fact

18

believe that there are the laws, the regulations, and

19

possibly other parts of the Constitution --

20

QUESTION:

I

Well, I am more concerned with your

21

view of what the Constitution requires rather than ycur

22

view of what is normally done in the school scene.

23

MR. NODES:

I believe that the extent cf the

24

search cculd become part cf the standard, and while it

25

might be reasonable to search a person's pockets, search

14

1

a person’s jacket, the person’s locker, or person’s

2

purse for a certain item, it would not in many

3

instances, possibly the same circumstances, be

4

permissible to strip search the student.

5

I think it would almost never be permissible.

QUESTION;

If the school official suspected

would apply.

QUESTION:

Is there any regulation against the

MR. NODES:

QUESTION *

The difference between a man cr a

woman

walking on the street, downtown Washington, and a

5

student, a minor, in a school.

6

MR. NODES*

Well, I believe that there are

7

many differences between a person on the street -- I

8

believe that first of all there may be a difference

9

between a minor on a street carrying a purse —
QUESTION*

10

Well, we don't have to worry about

11

a minor on

the street.

12

the school here, and the comparison I am surprised you

13

haven't made in your analysis is that there is a

14

difference between a student who has been sent to school

15

by the parents and is required by law to go to school in

16

the school quarters and a person walking on the street,

17

an adult.
MR. NODES*

18

We are worrying about a miner in

Sell, I believe that when a

19

student is sent to school,

20

state takes on a responsibility for ensuring not only

21

that that student is educated, but also that that

22

student is safe and secure while in school, and that

23

discipline is maintained while in school.
QUESTION*

of course, the school and the

Well, Mr. Nodes, you think

there is

difference that the Fourth Amendment shouldn't

apply

at all?

HR. NODES:

3

QUESTION:

4

HP. NODES:

I believe -That was your first submission.
les, I believe that there is such

5

a significant difference in the function performed by

6

the school teacher during the school day that the Fourth

7

Amendment shouldn't apply.

8

would also be applicable concerning a reduced standard.

9

QUESTION:

Right.

HR. NODES:

10

However, the same arguments

The teacher does act in an ir locc

11

parentis manner during the schccl day.

12

possible that since the advent of mandatory compulsory

13

education up until a certain age, that the traditional

14

Blackstonian views and reasons for imposing the in Icco

15

parentis doctrine would no longer apply.
However,

16

Now, it is

when we leek at what is happening in

17

fact, it is clear that as far as the supervision of

18

juveniles, the teacher acts in loco parentis.

19

the student spends as much as a third cf his or her day

20

attending a public school.

21

teachers and administrators provide the only supervision

22

which that juvenile, that student has, and in many ways

23

they take the place cf and perfcrir the functions cf

24

pa rent s .

25

QUESTION:

Firstly,

During that period, the

That's correct.

17

1

QUESTION

And does that mean that their

£

2

authority then to make searches, if the Fourth Amendment

3

is completely inapplicable, extends to any kind of

4

search, strip search or otherwise?

5

MR. NODES:

I believe that if the Fourth

6

Amendment is inapplicable, cf course, the Fourth

7

Amendment would not itself fcrhid strip searches.

8

However, I think that strip searches are such an

9

egregious example,

and the courts, the Circuit Courts

10

have continuously held this, that there could quite

11

possibly be another constitutional violation.

12

QUESTION.:

13

MB. NCDES:

What one?
It is possible that under Rcshen,

14

for instance, this would be considered such an invasion

15

of the person's privacy, and such an unwarranted

16

invasion that it would be constitutionally

17

impermissble.

18

not be necessary to use that.

However, I think that even that, it would'

19

I believe that strip searches can be stopped

20

very easily without the Constitution, ar.d I might note

21

- that in many of the strip search cases there has been

22

either a finding of no ccnstituticnal violaticn cr there

23

has been no punishment of the violators.

24

primarily the cases say no punishment cf the violators

25

because of the circu Distances.

18

I believe

But for two reasons, those searches will he
stopped.

First of all, I believe that in all states

people are becoming more sensitive to strip searches
whether they are conducted by law enforcement
authorities cr by ether persons, and there are laws now
which limit even the authority of a police officer tc
conduct a strip search.
However, maybe even mere importantly, the
factors which were noted in Ingraham v. Wright by this
Ccurt -QUESTION!
argument,

Well, if I understand your

though, ?.r. fiedes, it is that because the

Fourth Amendment is 'inapplicable, nothing in the Fourth
Amendment can restrain a strip search of a student by a
teacher?
NR. NODES!

I believe that that would be

correct, yes.
QUESTION!

W-hat is the basis for that

argument?

You are saying they are not unreasonable

searches?

Is that what it is?

In terms of the text of

the Fourth Amendment.
MR. NODES!

As far as the text of the Fourth

Amendment, I believe that the Fourth Amendment was
directed at the state acting as the state.

New, in

certain circumstances I believe that the state can take

on a rcle which is traditionally held hy private

persons .

Sc what ycu are saying is, it is

It is not unreasonable —
Even a strip search is net

unreasonable .
NR. NODES:

Yes.

That is not unreasonable.

It would not be unreasonable for a private person, and
in this instant it is not unreasonable for the state.

Mr. Nodes, assume for a moment that

the New Jersey court is correct in saying that the

Fourth

18

standard was the appropriate standard for review.

19

Amendment applied, that a reasonable suspicion

Do you think that that means individualized

20

suspicion under the New Jersey rule, or would that mean,

21

for example, that if the school authorities suspected

22

there were drugs being used in the restrooms, they could

23

install two way mirrors or listening devices based on af-

24

generalized suspicion?

25

MR. NODES:

Your Honor, I think

24

that that

1

probably would be determined by the type of

2

investigation which they were attempting to conduct.

3

am not sure exactly how far they could go with miner

4

school violations.
QUESTIONi

5

I

Hell, I was curious tc knew what

6

you thought the New Jersey rule was, whether it required

7

individualized suspicion or something else.
MR. NODES:

8
9

I believe that the New Jersey

court was, because of the contours of this case, talking

10

about individualized suspicion, and they simply weren't

11

faced with a standard where a school had tc take care of

12

a situation, for instance, where knives were being

13

brought to school every day, and they might have tc

14

search students coming into the school to make sure

15

there were no knives being brought in.

16

That could raise a whole new set cf problems,

17

but the New Jersey court didn't have tc deal with those

18

questions in this case.
QUESTION:

19

Mr. Nodes, you are not adopting the

20

New Jersey ccurt standard, and I would le interested to

know your answer to Justice C'Ccnnor's question.

22

Supposing the school had reasonable suspicion that the

23

restroom was being used to smoke in, as was the case

here.

Could they put in two-way mirrors?

QUESTION;

9

Why would you need reasonable

23

MR. NODES;

There are many -That is a serious question.
I understand.
Apparently you don't.
I understand

that, but I would

24

assume that the two-way mirrors would replace the

25

mirrors which would already be up in the mens* room, and

26

1

I assume that that would be the mirrors in front of

2

which ycu normally stand to comb your hair cr make sure

3

that your clothing is appropriate, and things like

4

that.
I don't believe that the more private areas of

5
6

a men's room are going to have mirrors, two-way cr

7

otherwise.

8

in my question — I mean, in my answer.

So that was the assumption that I was making

In this case, we telieve that the problem with

9
10

the standard as enunciated by the New Jersey Supreme

11

Court,

12

that the court acted as if it were actually operating

13

under a probable cause standard, and as if it were

14

actually evaluating the actions of a police officer.

15

The Court first drew a line between a good

again, assuming the fourth Amendment applies, is

16

hunch and a reasonable suspicion.

They admitted that

17

there was probably a good hunch, but said that there

18

wasn't

a reasonable suspicion.
I believe it is very hard to draw a line cf

19
20

this type, and as I said before, I believe that at the

21

very least there was a reasonable suspicion in this

22

case.

However, I think mere importantly what the Court

23

should

be looking to is a common sense approach to the

24

problems that school teachers face each day while trying

25

to maintain order and discipline in schools .

27

And I don’t helieve that if the courts are

1
2

going to evaluate situations like this with the

3

strictness that they evaluate police officer searches,

4

that it is going to he possible for teachers, first of

5

all, to know what they can and cannot do, and secondly,

6

for them to he able to maintain any order and

7

discipline.
I think that a much more common sense approach

8
9

is needed in judicial review of the standard, assuming

10

that a reasonable suspicion standard is adopted.

11

believe that the vice principal in this case did take a

12

very reasonable and did take a very common

13

approach to ensuring that both school regulations were

14

followed and that a student wasn't punished

15

unnecessarily, and that the New Jersey Supreme Court

16

rather should have condoned this action, and viewed in

17

this light the actions of the school vice principal

18

totally appropriate and should have been affirmed ly the

19

New Jersey Supreme Court.

The State cf New Jersey suggests that no

The great majority of state and lower'federal

courts that have considered this question have agreed

15

with the Supreme Court cf New Jersey that searches

conducted by school personnel do come within the ambit

conclusion is constitutionally required.
As a matter cf historical fact, it is true

And certainly the question cf whether she smoked or not

12

the opposite approach, if the principal had opened her

purse and had not found a package of cigarettes, if he

had found nothing in her purse, that would not have

MS. DE JULIO:.

It may support it somewhat, but

I don’t believe that it is determinative, simply because

she could have been carrying someone else ’s cigarettes,

and I think we are talking about a chain of inferences.

7

Certainly there are any number of things which might in

about a chain of inferences, we have already gone three

10

steps away from the infraction at hand.

QUESTION;

18

May I ask this question?

We are

19

talking about standards a good deal.

Ordinarily police

20

officers or otherwise trained state personnel make the

21

judgments as to whether there are reasonable grounds,

22

reasonable suspicion, probable cause.
Is it your view that teachers should be held

to the same standard of good judgment as police

MS. DE JULIO;

MS. DE JULIO;

I think so, Your Honor.

Whatever the standard?
Whatever the standard,

because

4

I t hin k first of all that the educators operate in a

5

much more -- an easier environment than the police dc.

6

The police are frequently on the street dealing with

7

strangers and circum stances that are changing from

8

minute to minute.

9

The educator deals with a group of studerts

10

whom he probably knows very well, whom he will continue

11

to see on a daily basis, and in many instances has a far

12

better basis to make an informed judgment.

13

instances if he suspects, has a hunch that something is

14

going on that he feels might be a violation of the law

The teacher can simply

Dees knowing the student well

19

enable one to make a judgment as to what is reasonable

21

do you think?

22

MS. DE JULIOi

One of the factors which the

23

New Jersey court pointed to in assessing whether

24

reasonable grounds exist is the age, school record, and

25

past history of the student, and I think that these are

44

1

tools which sometimes the police are alle tc utilize in

2

their determinations of prohable cause, but I think it

would be, of course, appropriate to evaluate these

criteria in determining whether reasonable grounds

Dees New Jersey provide any special

The information was very fresh.
The fact of the students being

in, first of all, being together in the restroom, that

10

the cigarettes were not being seen being taken cut cr

11

removed, they were being consumed, and also the fact

12

that possession cf cigarettes, again,

by school rules.

14

Whereas a knife I would assume would be prohibited by

15

rules in every school, and a teacher would be well

16

within his or her rights to seize a knife, even if it

17

was seen just being displayed, and net being used in a

18

threatening manner toward another student.

There was no reason to seize them.

Absolutely not. Your Honor, and

I would submit that in the face of the eye witness

I would also suggest that the principal, if he

to investigate further,

only suggesting that in response to the concern that

18

Certainly it is quite correct that hindsight is better

19

than foresight, but once again I think that we have to

20

reccgni2e that we are net dealing here with an exigent

21

situat ion .

22

Smoking in the restroom is certainly an

23

infraction of school rules, and is certainly a problem

24

that the school had to deal with, but it just simply

25

does net rise to the level of a student possessing a

<48

1

weapon and threatening ether students, cr selling drugs

2

in the restroom.
There was no immediate harm.

3

It was net a

4

situation, as the police frequently have to contend

5

with,

where a split second decision had to be made.
QUESTION:

6

Well, I suppose you do agree in

7

general, though, that a school needs to respond quickly

8

and informally to violations of its rules by the

9

students, dc you net?

10

NS. DE JULIO:

11

QUESTION:

Certainly, but I --

Hew dc you think it would impact

12

then on that interest of the school to require the

13

assistant principal to drop everything and go down to

14

the police station and get somebody to authorize a

15

search ?
KS. DE JULIO:

16

I am not suggesting that that

17

should

be a requirement.

18

during

this appeal here argued that a teacher should be

19

required to get a warrant.

20

We have not at any point

In this particular circumstance,

I think what

21

I am trying to — the distinction that I am trying to

22

draw is between infractions of school rules which hawe

23

to be dealt with in some way but which do not implitate

24

a search, and which simply are not serious enough.

25

In day to day life there are many adults who

49

1

smoke cigarettes in places where it is not legal to do

2

so, but it would be difficult for a police officer tc

3

justify seizing an adult that he sees coming out of an

4

elei/atcr smoking a cigarette illegally and conducting a

5

sea rch .
The level of the infraction, the level of

6

7

harm,

the level of jeopardy is just simply net such that

8

we would authorize that type of conduct.

9

Certainly if the -- another New Jersey case.

10

State in the Interest of G.C., where the principal was

11

told by a student that another student was selling drugs

12

in the restroom, the court found that the principal

No.

What is the difference between the

mother and the teacher in your view?

11

MS. DE JUIIC;

Is that it, in your view?
MS. DE JULIO;

Yes, Your Honor,

I think --

with regard to the Fourth Amendment.
QUESTION;

In other words, the parent has an

20

inherent right to open the purse of the girl, but there

21

is no inherent right on the part of the teacher?

22

MS. DE JULIO;

Certainly the Fourth Amendment

23

would net be violated by the parent conducting a search

24

herself or himself.

25

QUESTION ;

Haven't you got a little bit of

51

1

state action mixed in with the mother's action when the

2

MS. DE JUIIOj

Hell, certainly, if it were

with as a Fourth Amendment problem.

But in a purely parental situation, where a

circumstances that we wculd not perhaps find tc be

QUESTION:

Would you have any problem with

22

metal detectors such as those we have outside the Court

23

being at the schoolhouse doer?

24
25

MS. DE JULIO;

Well, certainly that is well

outside the facts of this case, but assuming that

52

1

hypcthetically the cases allowing the use of a metal

2

detector on a general basis, such as the airport, cr

3

that line of cases, are based upon the idea that the

4

individual is voluntarily seeking the service that makes

5

it necessary for him tc go through the gate.
Here, with students, they are compelled tc

6
7

attend

8

metal detector, which is a mere minimal instrusion into

9

privacy, certainly, but the element cf choice is simply

10
11

school, so by forcing them tc walk through a

An adult can choose tc take a plane or net,

12

knowing that a metal detectcr is cne of these things he

'will have tc submit to, but a child is required to gc tc

QUESTION;

of knives in a particular schocl, nc metal detectcr?
MS. DE JULIO;

Well, certainly there would

18

have tc be seme shewing that this particular tool was

19

necessary, but apart from that, again, I think that the

20

distinguishing factor, the factor which makes that type

21

of search possible and constitutionally permissible in

22

an airport and not in a school is the element of

23

volunt ariness.

Is that the only difference, that

MS. DE JULIO:

I think that that is certainly

a significant difference.
QUESTION;

What about a prison?

Would you say

8

you can't have metal detectors at a prison because the

9

people going to prison aren't going there voluntarily?

10

HS. DE JULIO:

Well, Your Honor, certainly the

11

difference between a prison and a school is a critical

12

factor in the analysis.

13

inmates have no expectation cf privacy in their cells

14

based upon the nature, goals, and operations of a penal

institution.

to appear on behalf of the respondent.

But I think

6

That I think is

that the prison analogy fails also

7

because the lack of rights is part of the punitive

8

feature of prison, whereas certainly ir an educational

10

is considered part cf the educational purpose of

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEE - REUETTAI

16

HR. NODES:

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

17

please

18

just given concerning the distinction between a student

19

in a public school and a student in a private school has

20

some importance in evaluating the differences between a

21

juvenile and an adult.

22

the Court,

Very well.

I believe that the analysis which was

Last term in Shaw v. Martin this Court noted

23

that juveniles are continuously under seme form cf

24

custody or another, and this does not mean custody with

25

total liberty, and it doesn't mean custody except when

55

a

1

student attends a public school.
What it really means is that they are under

2
3

that fcrir cf custody and the amount of custody which

4

will ensure their safety and their wellleing, and that

5

is why society insists on adult supervision of

6

juveniles, and that is why society insists that the

7

juveniles do be under continual custody.
QUESTION:

8
9

on that?

Mr. Rodes, may I ask you a question

Supposing a juvenile, a young lady in this

10

case,

was riding in an elevator with a law enforcement

11

officer, and she smoked in his presence.

12

free to search her purse in the elevator?
MR. NODES:

13

Would he be

I don't know if a search of the

14

purse would be at all -- I don’t know if there is any

15

kind of a violation that has occurred under your

16

hypothetical.
QUESTION;

17

There is a no smoking sign in the

18

elevator.

19

should have made that clear.

20

There is a city ordinance against smoking.

MR. NODES;

I think the violation would be

21

smoking a cigarette, and in that case there would be

22

really no relevance at all to whether or not she had

23

additional cigarettes.

24
25

QUESTION;

What if she denied she smoked?

Just like this girl did.

HR. NODES;

I think that the vice principal

I think there would probably be

10

less need for the teacher tc search the purse, or if the

vice principal had directly seen it, there would be less

12

reason for him to do it.

13

that —
QUESTION:

that is something

What if the officer in my example

took her to the station, and then the person at the

station says, I would like tc search ycur purse.

he hav e done it ?
MR. NODES;

18

Could

I believe the further you become

19

removed from individual direct observation, the more

20

need fcr proof of credibility there is, and the more

21

need for credibility proof you have, the more necessary

22

the se arch.
QUESTION;

23

Is there anything in this record tc

24

show that the vice principal didn’t trust the teacher's

25

veracity ?

57

MR. NODES;

Nc, there isn’t anything to show

that he didn’t trust the teacher's veracity.

that that is something which is appropriate, and

he should not be criticized for, at the very least.

7

What there

which

But whether the Fourth Amendment is held

8

inapplicable or whether a lower standard is applied, we

9

feel that what is necessary is that teachers be giver an

10

immediate and effective means of conducting searches and

11
