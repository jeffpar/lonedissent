To return to the statutory background, the

should

have their income counted against these benefits,

Ycu say the Secretary has just

MR. PHILLIPS:

7

Ther

If ycu were tc take that

8

position, but that is net -- I mean, as we understood

9

the legislafive history of the 1984 amendments,

what

10

they said was that they were verifying the law to

11

endorse the Secretary's preexisting interpretation, and

12

that they had acted in 1981 in cutting the way they had

13

with the projections in mind as the Secretary had

14

created them.

SR. PHILLIFS ;

So it is just simply -- we come to the same

QUESTION:

7

What we say is that the

Ycu say because there is a

8

possibility of unfairness tc individual claimants that

9

you have some reservation about applying the traditional

10

rule that you decide a case that is still alive by the

11

most recent Congressional enactment, but then as I

12

understand it what ycu say is that putting entirely

13

aside

14

properly analyzing the legal materials available before

15

1984,

16

they were wrong on

the

1984 ratification that has been

referred tc,

the Court of Appeals should be roversea because
the preexisting law.

17

MR. PHILLIPS:

That is correct, Your Honor.

18

To return for a moment tc the 1981 statute and

19

why it is we believe -- and why the Secretary concluded

20

that the mandatory withholdings must be included within

21

the $75 cap, Congress did two things.

22

First, it removed the reason ally attributa hie

23

work expenses provision in 402(a)(7).

24

this Court had decided in Shea versus Vialpandc that

25

that provision referred tc all expenses, subject only tc

14

Prior tc 1981,

1

a reasonableness limitation that could be attributable

2

tc inccire.

3

Every state recognized that those expenses

4

would also include mandatory payroll withholdings.

5

Congress took that provision and added it tc 4C2(a)(3),

6

the inference seems tc me inescapable that Congress

7

intended tc include the mandatory withholdings withir

8

that provision .

9

Jhen

But any dcubt on that question seems to me to

10

have been resolved because Congress added the work

11

disgregard to earned income, and earned income also had

12

been well established prior tc the 1981 enactment as

13

meaning gross wages, and therefore Congress called for

14

the disregard tc come from gross wages.

15

Accordingly,

16

treatment of 402(a)(7)

17

to require the conclusion that mandatory withhcldirgs

18

must be within the -- were always intended in 1981 as

19

within the mandatory -- or within the $75 disregard.

20

the

two, the combination of the

and 402(a)(8)

seems to me clearly

That also comports well with the policy of the

21

1981 amendments.

Eirst Congress intended tc standardize

22

this process to avoid any kind of arithmetical errors or

23

potential abuse, and clearly a 5*75 standard disregard

24

eliminates any kind of problems that might otherwise

25

arise in case of handling specific individualized tex

15

1

itsms.
Congress eliminated that by including only $75

2
3

as the cap.

In addition, Congress meant to save seme

by including a $15 cat that was below the national

That is the force of the

affidavit.

9

If you exclude those mandatory withhcldir.cs,

10

then the national average drops below $75, which would

11

mean that this provision was in effect a bonus for the

12

recipients instead of a cut, as Congress clearly

13

intended.

14

Thus in our view there is no way to read the

15

action cf the Congress in 1S61 in terms of its statutory

16

history and in terms of its policy of

17

but to endorse the Secretary's in te re preta ticn .

18

reasons that I think are even clearer, and that I have

19

already discussed, the 1984 amendments essentially

20

ratified the Secretary's interpretation.

21

live controversy as to that, and that issue then can be

22

disposed of readily, and we ask the Court to do sc.

MR. PHILLIPS;

7

That’s correct, that’s correct,

9

the time prior to the issuance of the original permanent

10

injunction.

11

QUESTION;

I see.

12

MR. PHILLIPS;

I see.

And its enactment.

Sc that is

13

still in effect.

Moreover, if you were to dismiss the

14

writ as imprcvidently granted, we have the additicr.al

IS

problem of the petitioners from the other states where

16

the Courts cf Appeals had rejected the Ninth Circuit’s

17

interpretation who are alsc before this Court, and those

18

cases would have tc be resolved independently, too.
If there are no questions, then I would

reserve the balance of mv time.

think what is very striking

20

is to.lock at the reasons Congress was given for

21

enacting the work expense disregard in 1981.

22

Schweikert, the predecessor to the current Secretary,

the petitioner in this case, at the hearings held

1

reason for the work expense disregard was tc provide an

2

incentive for AFDC recipients tc find the most

3

economical way to ireet their work expenses.
As we have shewn in cur briefs, the average

4
5

work expenses for a working recipient in California

6

prior to the *81 enactment was $83.

7

full-time at the minimum wage in the typical AFDC

8

household would have had withheld for payroll taxes, the

9

basic cere payroll taxes, at least $75.

A recipient working

• If that is the case, the idea of having a $75

10
11

work expense disregard that would allow recipients tc

12

take some measures tc economize on their expenses is a

13

meaningless provision.

14

entirely by the mandatory withholdings over which

15

recipients have absolutely no control.

That disregard would be eater up

16

Secondly, in terras of the statement of reasons

17

for this particular provision, not for some of the ether

18

provisions that were enacted during the 1S81 legislative

19

session, was given by the Senate Budget Committee.

20

The Senate Budget Committee listed three

21

reasons, and we have cited these in our brief:

one,

22

that there was great variation among the states in

23

dealing with work expenses.

24

clear

25

mandatory payroll taxes.

The record in this case is

that there was nc variation with respect tc
Fvery state gave recipients a

19

1

credit for those expenses, and it did not count against

2

them in determining their eligibility cr benefit levels.
Second, there was a problem of administrative

3
4

complexity and opportunities for error.

There is almost

5

no problem of administrative complexity and opportunity

6

for error with respect to payroll tax withholdings.

7

Recipients must submit each month their payroll stubs,

8

and eligibility workers and state welfare departments

9

take from these payroll stubs the exact amount cf

10

withholdings that an employer has subtracted from the

11

gross income of recipients.
find third, there

12

vas a concern for abuse by

13

recipients in claiming work expenses.

14

courts below in this case have indicated,

15

withholding taxes is a paradigmatic example of the kinds

16

of items that are net subject to abuse and fraud.

you will, and declare either fewer cr mere dependents.
QUESTION.:

legislation.

11

by Congress on

There appeared tc be re concern, no focus
this particular issue.

This comes up as an issue precisely after

12
13

litigation is brought challenging the federal

14

government's interpretation of this provision, and the

15

1S£t enactment is enacted in response to HHS bringing

16

that litigation to the attention of Congress, and it is,

17

I think, striking to compare Congress’s attention tc

18

this issue in 1984 with its total lack of attention to

19

the issue in 1981.

New, the real heart of the problem in this

20
21

case is an historical interpretation that has been

22

endorsed by this Court, that has been ratified by

23

Congress on several occasions, of the meaning of what is

that the states were considering as the income available

That is what I

20

was to put recipients in a worse position because

And the interpretation of the 1981 provision

21

does precisely that.

In 1984, Congress enacted some

22

previsions that modified the harshness cf that impact at

23

the same time they enacted the definition of earned

income, so that the prevision operating prospectively

25

will net be as harsh on working recipients as it is in

Basically, what has happened in this case,

after Congress enacted, without the HHS Secretary in any

impermissible construction at the time of Section

It makes no sense tc force HHS and the state to

The alternative, of course, is to simply
