these injuries, and the State commenced a felony

MR. SULLIVAN;

16

The State was required to prove

either that as a result of unlawful operation of a

either been injured and sustained great bodily injury,

1

After his second conviction, the New Mexico

2

Court of Appeals reversed, applying double jeopardy law,

3

principles enunciated in decisions in this Court, to

4

hold that the prior convictions in municipal court for

5

lesser included offenses barred the subsequent vehicular

6

homccide prosecution.

7

In so doing,

the Court of

Appeals made four

8

distinct important findings.

9

argument advanced by the State that the necessary or

First, it rejected

the

10

essential facts exception of Diaz v. United States

11

applied,

12

to commence its vehicular homocide prosecution until

13

after that injured person had died.

14

to hold that the State was

justified in waiting

The Court of Appeals looked to the wording of

15

the New Mexico statute which permits the State to

16

commence: a felony prosecution.

17

QUESTION:

Mr. Sullivan, it's the judgment of

18

the Supreme Court of New Mexico that's being reviewed

19

here,

20

isn’t it?
MR. SULLIVAN:

Yes, Your Honor.

But the

21

threshold of the decision in the New Mexico Supreme

22

Court critically relies on what the Court of Appeals did

23

in this case and what it didn’t do.

24
25

QUESTION:

So you say it’s necessary for us to

understand the Court of Appeals’ reasoning in order to

The necessary and essential facts exception of

Diaz were rejected by the Court of Appeals because the

8

State could have prosecuted because the injury, causing

9

great bodily injury to the victim of that accident was

10

available,

11

traffic offenses were prosecuted.

12

was known to the State at the time the

Second, the Court of Appeals held that

the

13

reckless driving and careless driving offenses are

14

greater and lesser included offenses for double jeopardy

15

purposes. That's been conceded by the State throughout

16

the litigation.

17

Third, the Court of Appeals held essentially

18

that DWI and reckless driving are lesser included

19

offenses under every case of the felony offense of

20

vehicular homocide.

21

vehicular homocide statute defines the offense in terms

22

of a prior commission of one of three modes of driving

unlawfully;

24

under the influence of drugs, or driving-recklessly.

exception when you're looking at municipal court

11

convictions for lesser included offenses of a felony

12

prosecution which is later commenced in a court of

13

general jurisdiction in the State.

14

This morning, I believe we are focusing on the

15

Supreme Court decision, the decision of the Supreme

16

Court of New Mexico, which held that Diaz v. United

17

States is still applicable with respect to the

18

jurisdictional exception.

19

The Court essentially held that because the

20

Carlsbad Muncipal Court had no jurisdication over the

21

felony offense of vehicular homocide, its judgments on

22

the lesser included traffic offenses could not serve to

23

bar prosecution for that felony offense in the State

24

District Court, which is a court of general jurisdiction

25

in New Mexico.

the rulings of this Court, the lesser included offenses,

the traffic offenses, were clearly lesser included under

UR. SULLIVAN;

What did Waller hold?
Well, Waller rejected the

4

notion, as I understand it, that because of a doctrine

5

of dual sovereignty --

QUESTION;

That's all it rejected was

the dual sovereignty theory.

8

MR. SULLIVAN;

That's correct.

But the

express language of the opinion. Your fonor , was that

10

the court rejects the Florida court's conclusion that an

11

individual could twice be charged for the same offense

12

and tried for the same offense, both in the municipal

court or a court of limited jurisdiction and then in a

14

court of general jurisdiction.

Those are exactly the facts presented in this
case.

that may be, but all they

There would be no other basis

But there is nothing in Diaz that

different jurisdiction of courts in the same system.

2

MR. SULLIVAN;

3

QUESTION;

That's correct Your Honor.

So I don't think

it’s right to say

4

that the jurisdictional exception depends on the

5

exception of the dual sovereignty here.

sovereignty theory that Florida sought to defend in

is a distinguishing feature between them.

14

I agree, Your Honor,

QUESTION;

Well,

Robinson v. Neil didn't add

anything to that.
MR. SULLIVAN;

16

No, but on remand when the

ORAL ARGUMENT OF PAUL G. BARDACKE, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT

9

MR. BARDACKE i

hr. Chief Justice, may it

10

please the Court, I’ve listened to Petitioner’s argument

11

carefully and I do not see why it is fair for the

12

Defendant Fugate to have killed someone while driving

13

recklessly, and then to turn and say to the State, to

14

society, and the victim's family, that because the very

15

next morning he rushed into municipal court, pled no

16

contest to careless driving and DWI, that he then cannot

17

be brought to justice for the later vehicular homocids.

18

QUESTION;

Could the State have declined tc

proceed against him until it knew the outcome of the

20

injuries?

MR. BAPDACKE;

Almost identical, although the

Are you telling me, then, that the

16

municipal prosecution,

17

would have to proceed?
MR. BARDACKE;

18

even over the State's objection,

It would not have to proceed.

19

What the fact is is that the municipal charges could

20

have been dropped, and the State could have proceeded on

21

State charges which are similar.

22

ORAL ARGUMENT OF J. THOMAS SULLIVAN, ESQ.

15

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

16

MR. SULLIVAN:

The Court of Appeals in its

17

decision held under New Mexico statute 66A-101C,

18

vehicular homocide can be committed only by reckless

19

driving or DKI.

20

If you look at the statute that defines the

21

felony

22

it's predicated on a finding of either DWI or driving

23

while under the influence of drugs or a finding that the

24

Defendant drove recklessly.

25

the decisions of the court, lesser included offenses of

-- of vehicular homocide,

They are, by statute and by

It seems to me that this kind of multiple

protects against, the filing of a relatively minor

19

charge in a court of limited jurisdiction, and then the

20

subsequent filing of a greater charge with a minor

21

charga was clearly the lesser included offense.

22

To follow the attorney general's reasoning,

23

all significant or felony charges could be broken down

24

into constituent elements, could be prosecuted in courts

25

of limited jurisdiction; the State could evaluate the

Yes, but -It’s a misnomer to call it a
