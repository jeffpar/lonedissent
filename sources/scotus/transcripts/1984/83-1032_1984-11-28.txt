12

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
These consolidated cases present two issues.

There is an initial jurisdictional issue,

2

Ke dc net consider that it is,

3

because as we read the statute it seems to us that,

4

though there is jurisdiction in the FEC to raise these

5

issues, that the question in the statutory construction,

that Congress did not intend private parties to be suing

7

each other, is the same issue.

So we think that the two

11

to limit aggregations and expenditures of wealth by

purpose is to influence the outcome of federal

electicns.
Where presidential candidates have agreed to

Turning first tc the question of the purposes

13
14

of the statute, of what Congress sought to achieve, we

15

think

16

what the effects would be where it had passed the public

17

financing statute after years of debate, a statute which

18

limited expenditures, which prohibited contributions to

19

the candidates, and which created a system in which

20

public financing was net merely a subsidy tc the

21

candidates of the two major parties, but was seen as

only a

these would take over the role that had previously teen

2

held by large contributors, and it was one of the

3

factors that was very prominent in the debate in front

of Congress* indeed, as we have set it forth in cur

But Congress estimated and locked at the

question of whether, if you prohibited these private

11

contributions and came forward with public financing,

12

would there not be a situation

13

would come forward making expenditures which were not in

14

control of the candidate or in control of the

15

candidates' parties, but which would be done by

16

committees composed of the candidates*

composed of people who were, as I say, in the business

18

of raising and expending funds to influence the

elections.

21

Congress concluded that in that situation you would have

22

in effect a candidate who wculd be beholden to these

23

large aggregations of private funds, a candidate whose

24

campaign was limited to $40 million in this recent

25

election under public financing, but who looked out

the effect would essentially be the same, that he world

5

wind up in the election needing tc woo that private

6

money, needing to know that that private money would

7

come forward on his behalf, and thus would be in the

8

long run beholden to that private money in the same way

9

that he would have beer, beholden in the situation where

10

there

were private contributions.
QUESTION:

11

Couldn't Congress have achieved

12

pretty much the same result here without limiting the

13

speech of third parties by saying that, where this

14

contributing takes place by a private group that appears

15

to be coordinated, that the candidate will lose sc much

16

of the public financing as is represented by the

17

coordinated expenditures?
ME. STEEIE;

18

Congress -- I knew of no place

19

that Congress actually considered that as an

20

alternative.

21

considered a variety of ways of trying to limit this

Congress was the belief that was strongly argued that if

25

you did net reach cut tc the committees, that you were

1

going to have a difficulty with the standard of

2

committees that seemed to be composed of supporters;

3

that at some point — what they were always debating was

4

the reach of the statute, cf hew far it could reach.

5

And where they drew the line was to the very political

6

committees that are in the business.

7

QUESTION:

Well, my thought stemmed from the

8

fact that I think Congress would have been on a stronger

9

footing so far as the First Amendment is concerned where

10

it says, we're going to deduct some of the money we’re

11

giving you,

12

with the Government handing cut money, rather than

13

saying, we're going to forbid you from making a certain

14

kind of expenditures for speech.

15

to the candidate, where you're just dealing

MR. STEELEs

I think that the concerns that

16

Congress expressed throughout it were, however, there's

17

another countervailing interest, which is in not having

18

someone make a determination in the two months before

19

the election that the funding should be reduced.

20

other words, one of the things that Congress saw was a

21

system where there would be an immediate block grant

22

known in its amount to the candidate, and that there

23

would be a grave danger that you would be interfering

24

with the very speech of the candidate which the public

25

fund was attempting to support if you get into a system
10
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

In

1

where someone, the Federal Flection Commission cr scire

2

form of decisionmaker, would have to decide, well, that

3

group is so allied- with the candidate that we'll reduce

4

the candidate's funds.

5

And I think that they saw great difficulty

6

with systems that involve that kind of interference.
QUESTION:

7

8

Well, aren't we really talking

about uncoordinated independent spending?
MR. STEELE:

9

QUESTION^

10

Yes, we are.
I mean, I thought — can't the

11

Election Commission already get at coordinated spending

12

when it gets close enough that it can really be be

13

blamed

on the candidate?
MR. STEFLF;

14

I think that there is no question

15

that the Commission under the statute can deal with

16

that.

One, that there is tremendous difficulty in

17
18

I would say two things:

dealing with that in any period before the election.
QUESTION:

19

Yes.

To sustain this law, you're

20

going to have to convince that the Congress can do what

21

it did

to wholly uncoordinated committees.
ME. STEFIF:

22

in many terms.

Yes.

I think that Congress spoke

23

of it

They spoke of it as the fact that

24

they knew from past experience, they knew from their own

25

personal experience.

I mean, the debates are full of
11

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

indications that they knew in their own personal

2

experience the ways that private money would flow into

3

the system.
They had historical examples in front of them

4
5

of how previous statutes where they had had narrow

6

definitions of the terms "contribution” and

7

"expenditure,” where political committees sprang up,

8

that there was no ability to prove immediate

9

coordination, where there was perhaps no need for

10

coordination in the sense of direct contact about

11

expenditures, tut spoke of the need for control of

12

expenditures where they were dene by political

13

committees, particularly ones that comprised -- there

14

was a good deal of conversation about the presidents

15

clubs and things that were not directly in the control.
And that what Congress foresaw and what

16
17

Congress predicted, what Congress held long hearings on,

18

was the very questions that are presently before this

19

Court:

20

which would allow it to reach out and counteract the

21

evil it saw in political committees that were composed

22

of people who were supporters of a presidential

23

candidate?

How could it devise a system by some method

24

Eecause it felt that if it did net control to

25

some degree those, that it would have a system in which
12
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

T

you would have unlimited private spending, where the

2

candidate would be held back, where the candidates'

3

party is held back, and where the balance would be

4

overthrown .
And in that sense, I think that the *67

5

6

debates that we have set forth are very prominently

7

figured there, because the original Long Act was a

8

proposition which was passed by Congress in 1S66 and

9

which then in 1967, in a six-week debate in front cf the

10

Senate, was eventually made ineffective until further

11

legislation was passed.
The very subject in debate there was the

12
13

question of whether a subsidy to the two major parties

14

with no restrictions cf any kind on it, no restrictions

15

at that stage on contributions to the candidate's party

16

or to the candidate, a variety cf other restrictions, no

17

accountability.

18

sense,

19

control of that private financing in a public financing

20

situation.

21

The Congress debated the issue, in a

QUESTION i

How does the statute or the

22

combination of them reach an independent political

23

action committee not coordinated with anyone and net for

24

any candidate, but against a candidate, against any

candidate who supports X, Y or Z positions?

14

of statutory interpretation there, tut that the fact

15

that a negative expenditure can be to further the

20

to those.

As well as the question that was before the

hearings on it, had testimony in what was, I wculd

re-emphasize, a very bread constitutional debate.
It was net solely a constitutional debate

2
3

about the issue of the control of expenditures.

There

4

was also a constitutional debate about the propriety of

5

the check-off,- which this Court resolved in Buckley

6

versus Valeo.

7

check-off allow people to designate their parties on the

8

check-off, which was felt by many necessary not to

9

interfere with the political parties.

There were proposals to have the

There was also a very strong debate about how

10
11

to structure a public financing law sc that it would not

12

interfere with the rights of third parties, and one of

13

the factors, if there is no control on independent

14

expenditures, is that the subsidy that is then put ferth

15

puts third parties at a greater disadvantage.
QUESTION;

16

Well, Nr. Steele, notwithstanding

17

these concerns expressed by Congress, what about the

18

fact that in Buckley versus Valeo spending by political

19

associations was treated as expenditures entitled to

20

protection under the First Amendment, full protection?

21

Isn't that the problem that you have to deal with here?
MB. STEELE;

22

One,

I would deal with it in two

23

ways.

I would say that I think this Court's

24

analysis in Buckley versus Valeo made it very clear that

25

that was in a balancing test.

I do not think that this

15
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

Court has said in Suckley, I think, in subsequent cases

2

— I would cite to both the Eellotti case and the CABC

3

case — that this Court has spoken in terms of if

4

independent expenditures dc pose a danger -- and that is

5

of course the question that was in front of Congress and

6

in that sense is in front of this Court.
But that there is a difference in the

7

8

constitutional balance with regard to expenditures; that

9

the question is how these expenditures affect the

10

process.

11

balancing test there, rather than full protection under

12

the Constitution fer any expenditure of any kind.
QUESTIONj

13

And in that sense, I think that there is a

What was the second case you

15

I think that’s implicit in tcth.

16

The Berkeley case, we refer to it as CARC.

17

18

in both those cases, I think the Court dealt with the

analysis as the question was one of the governmental

interest balance.

gamut.

The second point that I would want tc make is

Dealt with by

It is a much narrower focus cf

10

that in this broad debate there was considerable concern

expressed by Congress,

13

allowing for individual and group speech and

asscciational rights tc come forward in the political

16

that is that is enshrined in the

They have been listed.

I don't want tc rur.

17

through them all, tut there are very significant ones.

18

First of all, under this very statute individuals are

19

not limited in their expenditures.

20

this makes the statute discriminatory.

21

Appellees argue that

It seems tc ire, tc the contrary,

what it shows

22

is that Congress was very sensitive to the balance it

23

was making, and in a Ccnstituticn whcse basic

24

protections are for individual rights, while you have a

25

question of whether these individual rights to associate

and to operate through a group have been curtailed by

2

the statute, nonetheless the very protection of

3

individuals to spend is of great importance.

4

There are also protections in the statute for

5

volunteer activities, for expenditures toward political

6

meetings and groupings.

7

Congress that this balance that it felt it was striking

8

-- and

9

There was a tremendous in

again, I refer to the fact -QUESTION.:

Let me interrupt you once mere, Nr.

10

Steele, because it seemed to me that in Euckley when the

11

Court upheld the prevision limiting contributions, that

12

one of the reasons the Court gave for doing that was

13

that individuals could cent rib ute to political

14

associations and pool their resources and gain

15

expression in that fashion.

16

And yet you're now saying that that aspect can

17

be curtailed as well.

MR. STEEIE:

of whether the limit is drawn tcc lew is essentially a

6

legislative one, but that the question of whether that

can be limited again is a question that was dealt with

in the contributions area.
I agree that one of the rights left there is

to contribute and tc participate in political

MR. FEIRSCNs

Mr.

Chief Justice and may it

please the Courts
With respect to the question that the Chief
Justice just posed about the dollar limitations, it

10

might be well to remember that in a somewhat analogous

11

provision of the federal election laws, Section 441(b),

12

the Congress applied an absolute prohibition upon

13

corporations and unions on expending any amount of money

14

in independent expenditures to further the electior of

15

candidates for federal office.

QUESTIONS

1

political expenditures since way, way back than

individuals have.

5

I don’t see how that supports anything about
what a political committee can do.
HR. FEIRSCN;

Well, Mr. Justice Rehnguist, I

6

think if you go back and look through

the NRWC case, the

7

rationale for why corporations have always teen treated

8

differently is their ability to aggregate wealth and to

9

use the corporate form.

In fact here, when we deal with

10

these particular Appellees, we are also dealing with the

11

corporate form and all the incidents that goes with it.

12

QUESTION;

Well,

to the extent you're dealing

13

with the corporate form, you can probably get them under

14

the section involved in NRWC, can’t you?

15

HR. FEIRSON;

No,' because that section dees

16

not — would not pertain here, inasmuch as under a

17

Federal Election Commission regulation they have

18

registered as a political committee and thereby hgve

19

taken themselves out from underneath 441(b).

20

essence the only difference here between the Appellees

21

in this case and NRWC, and

22

failed to register under the particular provision, the

23

particular regulation of the Federal Election Commission

24

that would have taken it out from underneath 441(b).

25

QUESTION;

So in

that case, is that NRWC

Well, certainly none of the

1

arguments, at least in reading Judge Eecker *s opinion in

2

the district court, suggest that all of these defendants

3

were corporations and that they should he subjected to

4

the corporate restrictions in the Act.
MR. FEIRSCN;

5

I think it is clear from the

6

reccri that both of the Appellees are corporations.

7

They are corporations almost identical to NRWC.

8

is, they are nonprofit corporations, they do not have

9

any members.
QUESTION;

10

That

Well, but Judge Becker

11

distinguished NRWC in his cpinicn on the ground that it

12

dealt with corporations.

13

argument at least wasn’t made to his court.
MR. FEIRSCN;

14

Sc it strikes me that this

I dcn’t believe that is

15

correct.

16

cannot distinguish

17

corporate form of the Appellees was indeed made to the

18

district court.

19

The argument on NRWC and the fact.that ycu

the corporate form cf NRWC and the

I think what Judge Becker was saying in

20

attempting to distinguish NRWC was, it is a different

21

case fcr the following reason;

22

corporations, when ycu’re dealing with corporations,

23

you’re dealing with an economic entity rather than an

24

ideclogical entity, and that was the basis of his

25

distinction.

He said that in

24
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

I think, that’s a faulty basis/ because NFWC is

1

2

not an economic entity, it is an ideological entity,

3

similar to the Appellees, which has in fact the same

4

purpose as the Appellees, which is to attempt to

5

influence federal elections.
By basic point is that if you look at what

6
7

NRWC was as an entity, their corporate form, how they

8

were structured, and ycu lock at the 441(b) prchibition,

9

which is absolute, it is very difficult, if not

10

impossible, to find any distinction between that case

11

and that particular party and these particular

12

Appellees.
They are all corporations, they are all

14

nonprofit corporations, they are all ideological

15

ccrporations.

16

input at all from theii contributors as to how they are

17

run or how they are managed or how the expenditures are

18

made.

None cf these three parties have any

So in the 441(b)

19

situation which was present

20

in KRWC, this Ccurt unanimously upheld a total

21

prohibition on independent expenditures.

22

in the Fund Act is a somewhat less restrictive

23

limitation, in that it does permit the $1,000 spending

24

limit.

25

What we have

And we would urge the Court to closely look at

16

QUESTION*

Hell,

why is that — why is one to

be preferred over another for First Amendment purposes?
BE. FEIRSCN;

I don't suggest for a second

that one is to be preferred over the other for First
Amendment purposes.

What I suggest is there has.to he a

balance between the two, and that this is not a black
and white situation where the Appellees come in and say,
our First Amendment rights have been violated and unless
you show me some compelling governmental interest you’re
going to lose.
What I’m saying is that before you even get to
the compelling governmental interest, this Court ought
to take into consideration

what are competing and

countervailing First Amendment values.
QUESTION*

A lot of that line of analysis was

followed by the Court cf Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit in Buckley against Valeo, and scuarely
rejected by this Court — the idea that you enhance
First Amendment values by subduing seme people’s speech
and' increasing other people’s speech.

We believe that it now reaches

that it was intended tc reach, only party-connected

3

expenditures for a candidate on his behalf or those that

4

were otherwise somehow coordinated with him, at his

5

request or suggestion.

6

the Court construes it that way, then Section 9012(f)

7

today is redundant and unnecessary, because since

8

when the Act was passed Congress has now characterized

9

such expenditures as in-kind contributions.

And

we readily concede that if

'71

In 1974

10

they did so.

12

read it that way.
But we are looking at Congressional intent in

1971,

15

since.

16

So now the Fund Act would be redundant --

and the Fund Act has net been tampered with
Congress has been silent.
We believe that the very wording of 9012(f)

17

itself supports our argument.

18

not all expenditures, not any expenditures, not

19

independent expenditures, tut only these which, if

20

would further his election.

It does not, for two reasons;

First, as Mr. Feirson pointed out, the FEC has

11

corporate expenditures contained in 441(b).

12

committees, which are defined in the Fund Act and in the

before this Court today if this Court viewed the FEC*s

We are not aware that

I would like first to deal with

the issue of the statutory interpretation.

We have set

forth in our reply briefs in footnotes 2 and 3 where we
think

that that was dealt with by Appellees in the court

below.
It seems to us that they effectively conceded
that the statute covers their expenditures, not only in
their papers to the district court below,

but in their

answer to the complaint, which stated that the
expenditures they would make -- it was also their
statement in the advisory opinion request that they
sought from the Commission.

having been the broad expenditure limit that was struck

down by this Court.

It seems very clear to me that, first

There was considerable

So that the concept

that Congress did net understand that these kinds of

expenditures would come forth in a publicly financed

system, one where there was an expenditure limitation on

16

the candidate, expenditure limitations cn his party,

17

prohibition of private contributions to the candidate,

18

limitations of contributions to the party, seems to me

one that is totally at odds with the nature of Congress

QUESTION:

What section of the statute would

HR. STEELE:

I would say that that would be an

interpretation of the statutory language that's involved
in this section, Section 9012(f).
