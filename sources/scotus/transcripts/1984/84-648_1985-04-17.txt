SNITOW, ESQ.

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER

MR. SNITOW:

Ws will hear arguments

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court*

9

The matter before the Court today arises out

10

of the district court’s dismissal of Plaintiff's claim

11

under the Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organization

12

Act, more commonly known as RICO, 18 U.S.C.

13

*58.

15

RICQ-type injury apart from that which would occur as a

16

result of the predicate acts had been pleaded.

The district court. Judge Glasser, dismissed the

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit

17
18

19

without

20

the issue, that there must be a predicate conviction of

21

either a predicate act or a RICO conviction.

22

our having the opportunity to previously brief

I suggest to the Court that if the Court of

23

Appeals’ position is upheld, then the RICO statute will

24

be for all intents and purposes no longer a viable tool

in the fight against systematic organized criminal

2

language of the statute clearly permits the type of

3

claim that was before the district court in this case.

4

Upon review of the Second Circuit's opinions

And I suggest to the Court that the very

5

and the various briefs which have been submitted to this

6

Court, what is most striking, I believe, is the creation

7

of artificial roadblocks that have to be read into the

8

statute in order to uphold the Second Circuit's

9

decision.
I respectfully suggest that the reading of

10
11

these artificial roadblocks into the statute has a much

12

greater effect than simply the question of whether

13

Plaintiff's counsel -- whether there will be a bar of

14

RICO Plaintiff's counsel, or whether the dockets will be

15

overcrowded.

16

Court in the Turkette decision, where the Court

17

recognized that if Congress has the power to cast this

18

kind of legislation we cannot in fact end the

19

legislation, we cannot end this type of claim, because

20

of concern for dockets.

I think those issues were decided by this

I think that what is at issue here is not only

21

the integrity cf the legislative process, where courts

engraft different conditions precedent that aren't found

10

public perception of this type of criminality, where we

12

create two classes, where we recognize that where an

13

enterprise is operated through a pattern of

14

racketeering, but suggest that if certain people don’t

15

fit into classical groups — La Cos Nostra, Mafia — if

16

that’s not the class, then you are immune, then you are

17

not subject to this particular type of statutory

scheme.

19

QUESTION*

What effect do you suggest this

20

would have on the criminal prosecutions under the

21

racketeering statute?

22

MR. SNITOWs

I think that the effect would be

23

that criminal prosecutors would be subject to placing

24

witnesses on the stand whom defense counsel could say

25

would be interested, and their sole interest would be

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

creating the predicate for later civil prosecution.

2

adds an extra burden to prosecutors being able to place

3

witnesses on the stand, who traditionally have very

4

little or do not have any legal stake in the outcome of

5

particular litigation.

6

It

I mentioned the Haroco decision, Your Honor,

7

fit the end of the decision, the court says that if we

8

felt that public policy was at stake here, if we felt

9

that there was some larger good to the Republic that had

10

to be served here, then we might engage in the kind of

11

pruning that the Second Circuit engaged in.

12

not the case.

13

Eut that’s

I submit. Your Honor, as a former prosecutor

14

that I have seen persons who have been defendants in

15

criminal actions, who have been granted the iargesse of

16

our laws in having evidence suppressed, honestly believe

17

and create the impression that they were innocent as a

18

matter of fact, rather than having been able to take

19

advantage of procedural safeguards.

20

I suggest that’s exactly what happens in this

21

Court, and the danger to lawyers who trivialize and

22

believe that they can say to a court that the type of

23

facts that are represented here are merely a routine

24

commercial dispute — that’s what's suggested by the

25

Respondents here, that this is a routine commercial

In footnote 3 of the brief, they suggest to

2
3

the Court that in fact there was only a technical

4

violation.

5

they have failed to say that when the Defandant was

6

convicted of a crime by a Nassau County grand jury, they

7

failed to suggest what particular statute they were

8

convicted under.

If you look at that footnote, curiously,

The statute under New York penal lav was

that that’s true here.

I guess it*s possible in your view that a single

20

22

one must litigate because one has been the victim of

criminal activity — not technical frauds, not garden

24

— if this statute is not available, the realities of

to go forward.

3

If the Court reads in the brief submitted by

4

the Attorney General of Arizona and makes reference to

5

the Posner article on the effect of this type of

6

litigation, the Court, must recognize that the realities

7

are that when cne walks in and accuses someone of fraud

— I think Congress understood this -- fraud through the

9

operation of an enterprise, the kind of sophisticated

13

criminality we're talking about —
QUESTION;

Counsel, wasn't this particular

statute kind of an afterthought in Congress?
MB.

SNITOWi

No, because I believe that there

14

has been some language -- if you ask whether

15

chronologically it came into the statute later, yes.

16

QUESTIONS

But the legislative history is

17

comparatively deficient when compared with other types

18

of general statutes.

the later

24

statements where they recognized that the civil damage

would reach outside, would reach outside cf

1

scheme her;

2

mere traditional organized crime.

3

And in one instance the Congress -- there was

4

a notation in the House that they understood that the

5

civil side was an important part of this statute, that

6

in fact it was an adjunct to the criminal, in fact

7

possibly more important than the criminal section,

8

because it provided an opportunity for the private

9

litigant to act as a junior attorney general in terms of

10

searching out this type of wrongdoing, one that I must

11

candidly say prosecutors in many respects aren't

12

equipped to deal with, can't deal with, don't have the

13

resources to deal with.

14

QUESTI ON s

Of course, you wouldn't — you

15

certainly couldn't regard Judge Oaks as one who is, as a

16

judge who is net sensitive to this kind of thing.

Then let me say this. Your

racketeering activity.

3

Honor, make it very clear that there are specific

4

And those trfo statutes, Your

And as the Haroco court in the Seventh Circuit

5
6

said very clearly, and as this Court recognized, it was

7

a carefully drafted statute and it is broad for a very

8

important reason -- because it doesn't wish to foreclose

9

the eight to bringing all who get involved in this type

10

of activity.
QUESTIONS

11

But if you prove two of these

12

predicate acts, you have proved a pattern and you have

13

proved the enterprise and you have proved the damage?

14

HR.

SNITOWi

15

QUESTIONS

That's correct.
And so this is just a statute that

16

permits people to have a civil recovery for the damage

done to them by criminal acts as long as there are two

18

of them?

21

HR.

SNITOUs

QUESTION;

Well, Hr. Snitow,

the initials

22

'’RICO’' apparently stand for Racketeer Influenced and

24

would be hacd to transpose that title to the kind of

3

so, and I will say why.

4

SNITOWi

QUESTION*

Judge Rehnquist, I don't think
I don't think so —

Well, do you think that the

5

Defendant in this case was either racketeer influenced

6

in the ordinary sense of that word or a corrupt

7

organization ?

8

HR.

9

SNITOWi

absolutely do.

Yes, Your Honor, I do.

I

I think that when — I think that

10

there's no difference than when someone who is a known

11

made member of a family, as the FBI may have dubbed him,

12

and someone else runs a boiler operation or a bustout

13

operation, it doesn't matter who the individual is that

14

does it .

15

QUESTION;

I agree with you completely.

I'm

16

not saying that any particular organization ought to be

17

above suspicion.

18

this as a case of business fraud, and you say it's

19

serious business fraud which resulted in a Nassau County

20

convict ion.

21

But you know. Judge Oaks described

But it still seams to me it's something of a

22

step to say that it's racketeer influenced in the sense

23

that Congress used the word in the title.

24
25

MR. SNITDWs

The only time they used it was in

the title, and the Congressional history, as we pointed
13
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

out, demonstrates that Congress, both the Senators and

2

the Congressmen, recognized that it would in fact be

3

used against others.

4

But more importantly, look, at the genesis of

5

the word "racketeering."

6

until the early sixties the FBI did not recognize the

7

traditional La Cosa Nostra family crime syndicates.

8

They are a creation — I*m not saying in fact a

9

creation, but I’m saying the concept of they as being

10

the only racketeers, they are of fairly recent vintage.

11
12

Traditionally, Your Honor,

The question of racketeering as that's
traditionally been known is an act, a type of conduct.
QUESTION:

13

Well, I am not sure I agree with

14

you.

15

"racketeering" means someone who earns a living or a

16

company that makes its way by corrupt practices.

17

I'm not sure how relevant all this is, but to me

MR.

SNITOW:

Your Honor, would I have the

18

opportunity to conduct greater discovery into the files

19

of Imrex to determine whether in the conduct of their

20

business with the other suppliers, directly with our

21

Federal Government, they had the right — or they were

22

involved in other acts of a similar nature?

23

first on the FBI taking an interest in random businesses

24

to determine whether in fact they've engaged in other

25

firms of racketeering?

Must I rely

precluded and limited cur right to documents.
QUESTION:

3

Counsel, did I understand you to

4

say that in 1960 our Government didn’t know what

5

racketeering was?
MR.

6

SNITOW:

No, Your Honor.

What you

7

understood me to say is there was a period of time that

8

the racketeering as that term has been used to suggest

9

the La Cosa Nostra, that type of activity was not

10

recognized by Hr. Hoover as the only form of

11

racketeering,

QUESTION;

What is the difference, really,

15

between your case and the hypothetical we've been

RICHARD JORDAN EISENBERG, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF RESPONDENTS

Mr Eisenberg.

MR.

EISENBERG;

Mr. Chief Justice, may it

please the Court;
The question here, the principal question
here, of course, is whether or not a civil RICC

10

plaintiff must plead and prove a so-called RICO-type

11

injury or racketeering enterprise injury to prevail

12

under Section

13

1964(c) of the Act.

Petitioner suggests that the imposition or the

14

adoption of the RICO standing requirement is merely an

15

abstraction in addition imposed on the law by various of

16

the iistrict courts simply because the courts don't like

17

the notion of the increased burden on them which would

18

occur as a result of a broad reading of the statute.

19

We say, no, contrary to Petitioner's

20

arguments, the standing requirement is essential to the

21

proper and just application of the law, and this Court

22

does have before it today what we think is a proper

23

basic definition of the term, the concept racketeering

24

enterprise injury.

25

Why do we say, first, that the racketeering
22
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

enterprise injury requirement is essential to the proper

2

enforcement of the statute as expressed by the will of

3

Congress?

4

why this is so.

There are at least three significant reasons

First,

5

the racketeering enterprise injury

6

staaiing requirement comports with the legislative

7

history

8

divined, an! it comports further with the stated overall

9

purposes of the entire RICO law, which is the giving to

and legislative intent as far as it can be

10

the Government enhanced weapons in the fight against

11

organized crime.
Second, we say that the imposition of 'the

12
13

racketeering enterprise injury standing requirement is

14

entirely consistent with the fact that the genesis of

15

civil RICO was in the concept borrowed from the

16

antitrust laws, that concept being an antitrust standing

17

requirement.
Third and finally, we say that the direct

18
19

result of a failure to adopt the racketeering enterprise

20

injury would in fact result in the use of the law for

21

purposes entirely beyond the consideration of the

22

Congress.

23

First, if I may return to the issue of why the

24

racketeering enterprise injury requirement is consistent

25

with the stated purpose and legislative history of the
23
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

statute.

2

the purpose of RICO as a whole, including the civil RICO

3

statute, was to enhance the ability of Government to

4

fight organized crime.

It is clear from the legislative history that

5

RICO as a whole, and specifically civil RICO,

6

was never intended, and there's no basis to claim this,

7

for the Congress to create a new federal fraud statute.

8

Nor was it intended as a recidivist statute, to give an

9

individual prosecutor additional sanctions against a

10

defendant who had committed two predicate acts or two

11

criminal acts, two felonies,

instead of simply one.

The stated purpose of the Congress in enacting

12
13

RICO — and this has been discussed by this Court in

14

Turkatte — was to combat the infiltration of organized

15

crime into legitimate areas of the national economy and

16

to combat criminally organized entities which prey upon

17

the national economy.

There is no question that,

mechanically the language of the statute, the single

commission of the two predicate acta can be claimed to

be the pattern of racketeering activity and there is a

that way because of the legislative history and the

2

purpose of the statute?

3

MS.

4

The principal reason why the enterprise injury

5

recovery must be clear from the statute is the analogous

6

construction of the statute taken from the wording of

7

the Clayton Act.

8

requires violation by reason of a violation of 1962.

9

That is, that "by reason of a violation of” language is

10
11

EISENBERC:

Indeed, correct.

Section 1964(c), as we have said,

entirely consistent with antitrust doctrine.
This Court in the Brunswick Corporation versus

12

Puerbo Bowl-O-Mat case discussed by Judge Oaks’ in the

13

opinion below made the point that there is an antitrust

14

standing requirement, that a distinction can and must be

15

made between those injuries intended to come within the

16

rigors of antitrust law and those which are beyond it.

17

We say the analogy is clear here.

There was

not intended

doctrine into civil BICO, but the concept that a

standing requirement separates the intended uses of the

16

On your standing point, Mr.

2

come before this Court.

3

there is a clearly usable basic definition of the

4

racketeering enterprise injury as it relates to Section

5

1964(c), and we have described it in our brief.

6

We do suggest,

however, that

If I may respond in a bit more detail, the

7

essence of it is as follows.

8

two basic patterns of conduct, conduct characteristic of

9

organized crime — and that is not the same as conduct

10

connected to organized crime associations; 1*11 return

11

to that in a moment.

12

Section 1962(c) separates

The two basic types of conduct are:

the

13

acguisition of or infiltration into a previously

14

legitimate business by criminal elements; and secondly,

15

the operation of an enterprise through a pattern of

16

racketeering activities.

17

We say that there are appropriate criteria for

18

determining what is conduct characteristic of organized

19

crime, and there are two basic criteria in this regard:

20

First, is the pattern of racketeering activity alleged

21

to include a hierarchy or internal discipline

22

characteristic of organized crime?

23

allegation that amongst those who are supposedly

suggest in this case there is none, and in the

cases there is no such allegation.

7

We

The second basic criteria which we say is at

8

the heart of the racketeering enterprise injury

9

requirement is the issue of corruption itself, and the

10

point was made, I believe by yourself. Your Honor, just

11

a few moments ago that the very title of the statute is

12

Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations.

13

We say the standing requirement makes a

14

separation between ordinary commercial disputes -- and I

15

do not mean to trivialize them as a class cr to

16

trivialize the dispute here.

17

there's a distinction between ordinary commercial

18

disputes and the racketeering influenced corrupt

19

organizations which were the target both of the criminal

20

and civil aspects of this law.

21

I am, however, saying that

then civil RICO is made out if in addition there are

claims of an internal hierarchy or internal discipline

But very, very few of these cases have gone to

We cite the example of one in the Fifth

I respectfully submit that the

This Court could conceivably say that a prior

24

conviction is not necessary, but that a civil RICO

That raises

It has other practical effects

I want to return just very briefly to the

argument made that the holding of the Second Circuit

9

reimposes through the back, door, so to speak, the

10

organized crime connection requirement.

11

not.

12

We say it does

The civil RICO plaintiff does not have to

plead a connection between the actors, the defendants in

that is not the same as saying the racketeering

With all due respect. Your

EISENBERG;

Sure, but Congress has made a

choice, it seems to me, in selecting the offenses that

it wants to treat as predicate acts and in reaching out •

19

rather broadly for the purpose of deterring this kind of

legitimate business activity by potentially organized

MR.

EISENBERG;

NR. EISENBERGi

Over a period of many, many

12

years, Your Honor, just as one example which we state in

13

our brief, the 10(b)(5) action, the implied right of

14

action under Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act has required

15

a purchaser-seller requirement and has imposed an actual

16

damages recovery.

17

Both those issues could be sidestepped by

18

properly pleading a RICO cause of action which simply

says the same facts which would ordinarily be fraud in

QUESTION;

Hay I ask you -- a comment you made

25

problems vith the statute that are talked about in the

21

MR.

EISENBERG*

That's quite so, Your Honor,

22

because the remaining predicate offenses go directly to

23

what is classically the problems of organized crime:

24

force, coersion, and corruption; the bribery statute,

25

the labor racketeering statute, transportation of stolen
41

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

goods, narcotics, prostitution, organized gambling, and

2

offenses of coersion and force, kidnapping,

3

racke teering .

4

Those are clearly the sum and substance of

5

what the Congress was concerned about.

By attempting

6

to, as Haroco says, I believe, cast the net wider, it

7

included in its wisdom, the Congress, additional

8

predicate acts which conceivably are the predicate acts

9

of racketeering, but ironically have been utilized to

10

bring this law to bear against clearly legitimate

11

enterprises and enterprises which, although they are

12

isolated events, even if criminal conduct, are clearly

13

not racketeering influenced corrupt organizations,

14

clearly not within the intended scope of the law.

15

QUESTION*

I think, however, that your

16

posit ion it seem s to me would also raise some problems

17

for the civil plaintiff even if you excise the

18

securities issue from the statute.

19

these garden variety crimes that you just spoke of, you

20

would still have to prove separately a damage from a

21

pattern of racketeering activity wholly apart from the

22

damage caused by those crimes themselves.
