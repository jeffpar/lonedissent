25

Ted Snyder, Jr., and I’ll be referring to hire, as we

In 1940,

They exercised it by giving a notice to fills

And

there is

9

no dispute that that's the only grant they purported to

10

terminate and, for our purposes, the only grant they

11

could

terminate.
Everyone agrees that as a result of the

20

They can license new recordings.

There is,

They can use it

Ihey
in

as I've said, an exception to what

21

reverts to them, and that's what the case is about.

22

That exception, the exception for derivative works,

23

rel ats s to sound recordings, in our case, a form of

24

derivative work licensed by Mills prior tc the

25

termina tion.

6

1

Prior to the termination, as I've said, the

2

net royalties were shared equally, 50/EC, under the

3

standard practice in the industry.

that under the plain words of that statute which Kills

5

contends Congress knew what it was doing when it wrote

The Circuit, as I say, reversed and reversed

7

1

and I’ll be returning tc this

on the basic

2

premise, as stated by the Circuit — that Congress did

3

not realize what it vas legislating abcut when it

4

legislated for the exception, was not aware of or did

5

net have in mind the standard or typical or common

6

multiple grant situation.

7

And our position on that, which I will enlarge

8

upon is, that you're dealing with a statute that was 20

9

years in the making, that the Circuit emphasizes

10

correctly was initially produced after long study by the

11

Copyright Office, and you have a decision of the Court

12

of Appeals saying that, throughout the 20 years of that

13

gestation, the Copyright Office which lives with

14

copyrights and the business relationships every day in

15

the week, didn’t realize that this exception would be

16

treating that standard or typical ar rangeme nnt, and that

17

Congress -- which was at this for ten years -- didn't

18

realize it either.

19

We say with respect to the Circuit that that's

20

a drastically wrong way to view the work of Congress and

21

to interpret a statute.

22

the Court would presume if it had no evidence of

23

anything abcut what Congress knew or didn't knew.

24
25

We say it is contrary to what

This Court has said more than once that if you
have nothing else to go on, a judge ought to presume

8

1

that the Congress knows what it's dealing with when it

2

legislates, knows what's ctt there in the world that

3

will affected by the statute.

4

QUESTIONS

Nr. Frankel, the language cf the

5

statute itself appears to be addressed just to the

6

single grant situation, author to the person who uses

7

the work.

8

to address the third party situation.

9

It doesn't, cn the face cf it at least, seem

MR. FRANKEL;

Your Honor, it doesn't say

10

anything about third parties, hut it is dealing with a

11

world where grants and subgrants are the order of that

12

universe.

It covers that universe -QUESTION;

13

Fell,

that's our problem, cf

14

course, hut how to apply this language which may net be

15

all that clear as applied to the third party situation?
MR. FRANKEL:

16
17

Let me come to that directly,

Your Honor.
If you look at that exception, it says "A

18
19

deriva five work, prepared under authority of the grant

20

before its termination, may continue tc be utilized

21

under the terms of the grant after its termination.

22

this privilege does not extend tc new derivative

23

works.”

And we all agree on that.

24

New, first, there's a matter cf --

What it is says is, "the derivative work,

10

prepared under authority of the grant before its

11

12

terminated is the grant from Snyder to Mills.

13

the only grant they could terminate.

Let’s be clear.

The only grant that was
That’s

14

Now, the only thing that the exception applies

15

to cr could apply tc is a derivative verk prepared under

16

authority of that grant, because obviously the exception

17

is referring tc that.
If you’re dealing

18

with a derivative werk t bat

19

was not prepared under the authority of that grant, but

20

seme other grant, it deesn't get intc the excepticr at

21

all.

The exception only applies to that situaticn.
New, cur friends say obviously what Congress

23

wanted

is to protect them -- and we agree it is -- the cnly way

ORAL ARGUMENT OF HARCLD R. TYLER, JR., ESQ.

20

ON EEHAIF CF THE RESECNEEN1

MR. TYLER;

21

Mr. Chief Justice, may it please

22

the Court, the Snyders contend that this argument, both

23

in the brief as well as orally, on behalf of Mills,

24

really avoids and evades the principal issue in this

25

case.

And that is the contention that the Snyders made

23

1

successfully in the court below, that there is

2

absolutely nothing in the statutory language, whether

3

it's in the basic reversion section or the exception

4

thereto, or any of the purposes of Congress in passing

5

this language, which can indicate that Hills, as a

6

publisher, is a benefitted class under this

7

legisla tic r.
There is just no language in this statutory

8
9
10

set of provisions which deals with anyone in the nature
of hills.
It is argued that the language is plain.

11

12

agree with that.

13

as is the Second Circuit accused of saying, that the

14

language is ambiguous.

15

is very clear.

We

We are accused, of course, of saving,

Ss far as it gees, the language

First of all, section 304(c)(6) says that all

16
17

of a particular author's rights that were covered by the

18

termination, terminated grant, revert to the author or

19

as, in this case where the author is deceased, to his

20

heirs .

21

Second of all, the derivative works exception

22

is very plain on its face.

It says a derivative work

23

prepared under authority of the grant before its

24

termination may continue to be utilized under the terms

25

of the grant after its termination.

24

1

Now, contrary tc Min's argument, the Second

2

Circuit did not miss the point here at all.

3

olserved that the real problem with the exception

4

language is that it was designed tc apply to a one-step

5

grant only.

is meant by a utilizer and, of course, points cur

10

correctly that there is not the exact word

12

talking about here is preserving the right, which is a

13

copyrightable right, tc someone such as a record ccnpany

14

who takes an assignment from someone in the position of

15

Now, it is to be noticed also that Mills dees

24

not like to talk about the precise grants which are

25

shown in the Joint Appendix in this case.

authors, that there is anything in the statutory

9

language here that gives one scintilla of a suggestion,

19 years in the new statute to benefit

10

let alone evidence, that Mills in its position,

11

bargained for the 56 years — and believe me, members of

12

this Court, they knew hew tc bargain tc get their value

13

— when way back in the 1940s they agreed

14

with Sr yde r .

20

or indeed anywhere along the line, focus on the

21

principal objectives which Congress obviously intended

22

here;

23

protection, especially for those authors such as Sr.yder

24

who, way back in the early 20s, long before this

25

split

first, to extend for authors a period of copyright

KB. TYLER*

Mr. Tyler -- go ahead.
Second,

if you'll bear with ire,

not to benefit a publisher like Kills, tut to benefit

the public, to give

8

copyrightable derivative works.

the public access to clearly

Now, if you will notice in the opinion cf

10

Judge Weinfeld, he really never talks about those two

11

purposes, and I maintain that what happened

12

turn to the core of his holding, he misconstrued really

13

what the interplay

14

language were all about.

assigned away his rights, the statute intended to

benefit the assignee as well as the author.

that is correct.

27

In other

words,

the Snyders are well aware, as they have been in

2

the court below and here, that subsection 304(c)(6) is

3

subject to this privilege tc derivative works

utilizers.
To that extent, the reversion is somewhat

in the Mills brief here and some significant part by us,

17

the point being, as I understand Mills, that the

legislative history, as they claim Judge Weinfeld feund,

19

is inconclusive.
We dispute that, simply because if you analyze

20
21

clearly what happened here, that beginning in the late

24

the rights of derivative works utilizers, particularly

It is true that right from that beginning,

Now, it was this kind of thing that Congress

10

is attempting to achieve.

The only thing that is at

that there would be an extension of 19 years, bringing

New,

that means that if you look at that

14

source and then you look to the terms of the second

15

grant,

16

company, that is why we say these are still important

17

because we do not agree with Mr. Frankel that there is

18

some sort of dichotomy in the law.

that is, the grants made by Mills tc the music

There isr't.

19

Under the new copyright reversion section, all

20

that has happened is that new Snyder is back, owning the

21

underlying copyright, in the place of Mills, and should

22

receive the

second

Under the facts in this case,

And that means that

That is correct.

But we don't

That's why we're arguing, contrary to

14

Mills,

15

Congress didn't write out the language which would cover

16

exactly this transaction.

that the only problem with this case is that

17

Mills says this is an argument of ambiguity.

18

We say no; all this is is a classic situation where an

19

appellate court is asked tc construe a statute, the

20

clear intent of which is there for all to see.

21

QUFSTION:

I suppose you could argue that the

22

terms cf the license are, by implication, made part of

23

the terms of the original grant, because Mills was

24

authorized to issue these licenses.

MR. TYLER;

That's the error that the district

That’s right.

We say that’s fine,

So to sum up, what we're really contending

17

here is, once again, that if you look at — well,

take

18

the reply brief of Kills.

19

all who will read or listen.

20

argue that there's cnly one grant, the terminated grant,

21

which is the subject not only of the termination or

reversion provision, but as well cf the exception.

They frankly exposed this to

25

this;

So, ironically, what we come down to is

Kills accuses the Snjders cf obfuscating,

42

1

distorting, in particular, distorting the language.

2

argue that, as the Court of Appeals fcelcw held, the only

way you're going to distort the language of the

So, to conclude, it's perfectly clear, if you

You'd demur to the accusation.
Exactly.

look at the language and you lock at the legislative

10

history, that the real question in this case is answered

11

by simply saying that Mills doesn't fit in the class

12

designed to be a part cf the exception.

13

Thank you very much.

14

QUESTION;

Mr. Tyler, may I inquire, befere

15

ycu sit down, the Snyders ir ary event, even if ycur

16

opponent's view is the correct one, could issue new

17

licenses after the termination and derive income from

18

new licenses.

MR. TYLERs

Yes.

I think, as Mr. Frankel said

this morning, we would agree on that.

Now,

what percent cf the income that you would

from the 400-and-seme preexisting derivative works, as

2

opposed to new licenses that the Snyders world issue?

3

MR.

TYLER:

QUESTION:

are you --

Hew great is the problem?

do the Snyders really think that all

ORAL ARGUMENT OE MARVIN E. FRANKEL, ESQ.

17

ON BEHALF CF THE PETITIONER - REBUTTAL

18

MR. FRANKEL;

If the Court please, starting at

19

the end of Mr. Tyler's presentation, of course we argue

20

that the termination prevision and the exception in the

21

statute refers to only one grant,

22

the terminated grant.

Of course, we recognize that there is a

23

sub-grant or license cc r tern p iated in the world that these

24

people lived in by the grant from Snyder to Kills.

25

addition, we net only acknowledge tut insist that in the

45

In

1

world

Congress addressed in this statute, multiple

2

grants are the typical standard arrangement; net just

3

twe, but three, four, five, six, to financiers from

4

creative people to financiers, to distributers,

5

exhibitors, et cetera.

tc

And when Congress wrete this exception to

6
7

provide that the derivative works may be utilized under

8

the terms of the grant, the terminated grant, what it

9

was saying is,

we can't visualize all the arrangements

10

out there.

What we are doing for former derivative

11

works is simply maintaining the status quo.

12

fairest arrangement we can make.

That's the

If the artist gave up the derivative work

13
14

right for a lump sum in the past, the artist gets

15

nothing.

16

up on the basis of 50/50 or S0/10, that holds under the

17

terms of the terminated grant.

18

The status que he Ids.

If the artist, gave it

I think, that's what we mean.

22

Are we fighting abcut an

If we weren't here, and if the copyright had

23

been extended as it had, derivative work owners would be

24

infringing that copyright by purveying their derivative

25

works unless they had authorization.

So I’m quite sure that although my answer was

inadequate before lunch, the reason they’re happy to go

along is that they need the license in order to be
