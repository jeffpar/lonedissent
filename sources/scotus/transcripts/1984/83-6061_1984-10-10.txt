ORAL ARGUMENT CF CHARLES G. WHITE, ESQ.,

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS (PRO HAC VICE)

MR. WHITER

We will hear arguments

Mr. Justice -- Mr. Chief Justice,

and may it please the Courts
This is a case of statutory construction.

10

The

11

statute involved is found in Section 2114 of Title 18 of

12

the United States Code.

13

attempted robbery cf anyone in lawful custody or control

14

of mail matter of any money cr ether property cf the

15

States.

16

The statute was amended cr had been amended in

17

1935 to add in the words "or any money cr ether property

18

of the United States" to what had previously been knewn

19

exclusively as the Postal Rcbbery statute affecting only

20

matters dealing with the Post Office.
The question before this Court is whether cr

21
22

not Congress intended to expand the scope of that

23

statute to encompass any custodian cf any money cr

24

government property that they would prosecute under the

25

statute .

3

New, the Government has, of course, adopted

1

2

that position based on what they consider to be the

3

plain reading and unambiguous wording of that statute.

4

Petitioners contend that in fact the statute is net

5

unambiguous and that the — it suffers from various

6

defects in the way that it’s werded, and we will be in

7

position to argue that.
In addition, petitioners feel that the

8
9

a

congressional intent is certainly relevant, and I would

10

say controlling, as to what it was that Congress

11

intended tc do when in fact they amended the statute.
Petitioners will also propose to this Court an

12
13

alternative, what we believe is in fact the plain

14

meaning of the statute that comports with congressional

15

intent; and that is an — that will involve the

16

application of an ancient rule, a well-respected rule of

17

statutory construction called the rule of ejusdem

18

generis .
Now, the facts in this case are not totally

In the Eleventh Circuit

Basically, the Government's

I had stated in the very beginning that I

7

8

intended to show that the statute was in fact ambiguous,

9

and I think that the way to understand it is to lock at

10

the way in which the Government is contending the

11

statute should be read.

contends, and the Eleventh Circuit seemed to accept this

argument at the time, that the use of the disjunctive

always establishes completely and wholly separate

categories of crimes.

that the plain reading of this statute establishes that,

Otherwise, you may have, in

what the petitioners contend, which is a statute

10

which was only designed to — to close what was

11

perceived in 1935 to be a loophole in the Postal Roblery

12

sta tute.

13

Now, how does this -- how does this work?

If

14

we take each different category that's separated by the

15

disjunctive, we have mail matter is the first category,

16

and there’s no dispute as to what that means.

the way back to 1792 that regards this particular part

19

of the statute, or "any money."

20

What was it that "any money" means?

There's a

Surely,

21

if the category has to stand by itself, then "other

22

property of the United States" is not going to be used

23

to modify "any money."

would be in the possession of those who would

for a long time.

The courts have — have ruled on this

Congress is presumed to have known what the

7

8

precedents were when it added these -- these other

9

categories to mail matter or any money or other property

10

of the United States.

They knew what a lawful custodian

11

of these matters were, and there’s no indication in the

12

statute that they intended

13

for determining what it was that constituted a lawful

14

custodian.

to set up any other standard

Now, the petitioners contend that these types

15
16

of problems are all based -- and really the reason why

17

we are here before this Court is because the Government

18

was able to convince the Eleventh Circuit, of course,

19

that there was only two clauses with the "or."

20

you look at the opinion below, which we have petitioned

21

this Ccurt to review, you will see that there is a major

22

glaring mistake t^at was made in that opinion.

23

is that the writer of that opinion presumed that there

24

was a comma between the words "mail matter" and the

25

clause

The separation is into three

Now, going back to the analysis of what kind

6

of any money they were talking about and other

7

government property, we now see that Congress must have

8

intended when reading the statute in its plain and

9

unambiguous fashion that somehow the various phrases

10

would be related to each other; that the different

11

categories that the Congress was intending to protect

12

would le related to each other.

QUESTION*

Mr. White, if the Court were to

14

agree with you in this case, what wculd be the effect on

17

the other offenses?

18

They were convicted of ether offenses

ME. WHITE:

Yes, Your Honor.

They were

which 25 years was for this particular offense, and

21

other sentences would stand as is, right?

6

MR. WHITE;

That's correct. Your Honor.

7

Now, to proceed, if I may, when you look at

8

the — at the statute as it's written, the different

9

categories, mail matter or any money or other property

10

of the United States, it's clear that you have a

11

specific term -QUESTION;

12

Mr. White?

You say there are three categories

13

there,

Mail matter is one, money is another,

14

and other property is the third?

15

MR. WHITE;

16

QUESTION;

That's correct.
Well, then -- but the word "of”

stronger if the word "of" appeared before "other

However, I think that the -- the basic position

on the point of ambiguity is really what we’re
discussing, and we’re playing with these words, and
we’re trying to figure out what exactly they mean when

guidance that those words give is sufficient to override

Mr. White, cculd the Government

have charged the Garcias under Section 2112 in this case?
MR. WHITE:

3

Yes, they cculd have, Ycur Hcrcr.

4

They could have charged them under 2112.

The question,

5

of course, that may be decided if this case is remanded

6

back is whether or not since they have also convicted

7

the Garcias under 641, theft of government property,

8

whether or not it would be appropriate at this point to

9

impose additional penalties under 2112.

10

All of what I’ve said before about the wording

11

in attempting to answer the questions of the Court tries

12

to get us past the threshold question which caused this

the committee reports, aside from indications of various

phraseology changes.

15

General reflected his concern that the law of 2114,

16

which at that time was found in Section 320 of Title 18 ,

18

that was very good protection for those custodians cf

New, it was a letter.

It wasn't drafted in

such a way that it was going tc -- the way the letter

was drafted was going to become law.

25

their brief made some issue about the fact that he says

Well, that makes a let cf sense that he would

just use the term "custodians cf money" when he’s the

Postmaster General and he’s writing a letter to the Post

Office Committee in the House cf Representatives, arc

he’s talking about concerns of his own which are fer his

What he was concerned about -- and the

House cf Representatives underscores this -- what he was

concerned about were people coming in and robbing pest

offices not of letters, not of mail matter, but of

15

loophole, that this loophole in the statute was covered

16

so that they could use the statute with its very

17

stringent mandatory sentence if a firearm or dangerous

18

weapon was used, they cculd use the statute to protect

19

postal employees or those who have lawful custody cf

22

And he wanted tc make sure that the -- a

This is really what got this whole statute

started, the whole amendment process started with this

24

letter , with this request that this loophole be closed.

25

New, Congressman Dobbins, as the Government

points cut, was never ordained a "fleer manager," in

2

quotation marks.

3

turn tc the Congressional Record and turn back a few

4

pages from where the various quoted excerpts on this

5

bill are, or move back — up a few pages,

that Congressman Dobbins was from the Post Office

Committee, and he was apparently in charge of

shepherding quite a few bills cut of that committee

one that they would turn tc when they wanted tc ask a

answer the question because, as he told them, he was

14

consulting with the lawyers, the attorneys that worked

15

for the Postmaster General trying to construct the

16

wording of a statute that would simply and easily close

does net necessarily mean that they weren't interested

in the result.

25

There was some

Well, one year before, one year before this

amendment was enacted,

the Congress considered a letter

2

from the Attorney General -- I believe it was to the

3

House or Senate Judiciary Committee -- regarding the

enactment of what later became Section

In that — in that letter, the Attorney General, of

course, as the case -- as this Court remembers from the

7

9

General mentioned that he was concerned, of course,

11

protecting law enforcement officers.
He mentioned in the back — back part of the

15

as well, and he mentioned specifically the Post Office

16

18

before this 1935 amendment,

19

for situations of this nature.

cf this amendment, looking at the ambiguity and

the two different ways in which the statute can he read,

it becomes clear that congressional intent would control

under these circumstances.

5

justified, it would cnly be incorrect if in fact there

6

was a manifest congressional intent to the contrary.

Government has the burden, I submit, cf shewing where it

Ur. Chief Justice, and may it

please the Court;
Our position is that Section 2114 means

exactly what it says.

no real dispute that their conduct falls within the

statute’s plain language.

3

these consequences, however, by suggesting that Congress

meant something other than what it said in Section 2114,

MR. GANZFRIED:

If they lifted his wallet and

That’s right.

QUESTION.:

14

Well, Mr. Ganzfried, under your

15

view,

someone who stele, fer instance, a hammer from GSA

16

could be charged under this, and then there'd be a

21

MR. GANZFRIED:

If it's taken in a robbery and

24

they use that hypothetical in their reply brief is tc

25

And I would say I suppose the purpose that

25

My answer to that is.

1

first,

if it does appear tc be unduly harsh, that’s a

2

question for Congress to determine; and second, it's too

3

broad -- it proves too much because it would be the same

4

in the

postal situation.
QUESTIONS

5

Well, you would say, I suppose,

6

that the prosecutor simply has a choice whether to

7

charge him under 2112 or 2114.
MR. GANZFRIEE;

8

9

That’s right.

The prosecutor

is certainly not obligated to rely on 2114.
QUESTION;

10

New, if we thought the statute was

view, when the Court could look at a legislative history

13

ME. GANZFEIED;

Now, could the Court

There's no rule of law that

14

says that the Court cannot look behind the plain meaning

15

of the statute, but ordinarily the Court will do so only

16

when it's seeking tc resolve an ambiguity on the face of

17

the statute.

18

We would also add that the Court has said in

19

the past that a statement of a purpose in the

20

legislative history does not necessarily mean that that

21

is the exclusive purpose.

22

reports had read as — as you suggest in your

23

hypothetical, it would not resolve the case.

QUESTION;

Sc even if the committee

21

QUESTION;

Mr. Ganzfried, if — if Jose Garcia

22

had been prosecuted under 2112 instead on the facts as

23

the jury found them in this case, could the trial court

24

still have imposed a 25-year sentence by just giving

consecutive sentences under 2112 and

As I said, this issue was not raised, but he

took no occasion to say 2114 requires a postal nexus.

It was taken only in Hanahan, and it was taken there in

7

circum stances where the 2112 option was available and

8

recommended to the Court that there be a remand for

9

resentencing under 2112 and to treat 2114 as a

10

miscitation in the — in the indictment.
We have since learned in the second Rivera

case in the Second Circuit that there will be occasions

13

when the 2112 option will net be available because there

had not been a completed robbery under 2114, only an

when there's seme uncertainty in the language.

23

Here there is no uncertainty.

Each category

24

is separate, and there is no common characteristic that

25

runs through the three categories.
37

In essence, we don't

have a statute that has a long list of specific items
followed by a catch-all phrase at the end.

In fact, the

case on which they rely, the Stever case, my
recollection of the statute in that case in 1916 was
that the catch-all phrase at the end said something like
"or other similar" items to the items that it pursued.
We have nothing of that sort here.
Kcw, as I said, there's no rule cf law that
prevents the Court from looking at the legislative
history.

Cur position cn that is that when you look at

it and you take the legislative history as a whole, it
supports us.

The view -- the view has —

About that issue,

too.

Presumably it has.

the legislative history tack

18

in

'35 was net extensive, and I guess that's why you

19

call it a snippet; but the prime sponsor and advocate at

20

the hearing was this Mr. Dobbins, and his language and

21

intent emerges pretty clearly, Mr. Ganzfried.

22

what bothers me.

23

pending bill is to extend the protection of the present

24

law to property of the United States in the custody of

25

its postal officials, the same as it new extends that

That's

He said, "The only purpose of the

39

1

protection to mail matter in the custody of the public

2

officials -- postal officials."

3

And it just seemed tc me, frankly, that was a

4

pretty good indication of what they had in mind.

5

then there were objections tc the language by a Mr.

6

Walcott who said, and I quote, "This is the worst

7

drafted till I*ve ever read," said he, and offered

8

suggestions for clarifying the language, but they

9

weren't adopted.
MS. GANZFEIEEj

10

Well, two things.

And

First of

11

all, one of the suggestions that Mr. Walcott made was

12

adopted.

13

concern about the significance of Congressman Dobbins*

14

comments is first of all that they have tc be understood

15

in context.

16

scope of the bill.

17

the terms that are at issue here.

18

criticism of the bill on an altogether different

19

subject, namely the mandatory nature of the 25-year

20

sen ten ce.

21

The reason that I — that I don’t share that

He was net offering an explanation of the
He was not offering a definition of
He was responding to

In responding to that in which he was pointing

22

out that the amendment was net changing it — the

23

statute as it already existed had a 25-year mandatory

24

sentence -- he added that all we’re doing is, as you

25

said, but he was not offering an explanation of the
40

1

meaning of the statute.
Second, another reason why the comment is not

2
3

entitled to that weight is that it's inconsistent with

4

the words of the statute, and it's inconsistent with the

5

report of the committee of which Congressman Dcbbirs was

6

a member.

7

colloquies are hazardous bases for assuming what

8

Congress* intent was.

9

available only to the -- or heard by the members who

11

language is — is what is actually presented to all

12

members cf Congress, commands a majority vote in both

13

Houses and is signed by the President.
QUESTION:

14

Well, sure, but this was in the

15

post office section of the code, and it was suggested by

16

the Postmaster.

17

they were worried about were these little substations

18

where often there was property other than letters in the

19

custody cf the substations like a little bit of money,

20

and people were coming in taking money from these little

21

substations.

And the evidence all shows that what

And that's really why it was passed.

MR. GANZFRIED:

22

Well, we don't know why it was

23

passed, but it seems to me it -- I mean we can't leek

24

into the inner workings of the minds cf the members cf

25

Congress.

All we can work with is the record that
41

they’ve left.

And in trying tc seek cut the trail

towards congressional intent, the largest and test
signpost we have is the words of the statute they
passed.

And it would seem tc me —

MR. GANZFRIED;

I — I don’t know what his

QUESTION;

May I ask you a guestion that I --

I haven’t really been able to think through?

I assume

-- particularly Justice O’Ccnncr's reminded us -- that
the Government actually did not make use of this statute
for anything except postal cases at least until after
1948, really in only a handful of cases since then.
MR. GANZ FRIED:

Well, I — I tried to find out

the answer to that, just how many cases there were that
42

1

were prosecuted under 2114, and unfortunately, we -- I

2

could not find any records to answer that, and sc the

3

response that I gave to Justice O'Connor was based on

4

what I could find in the reported decisions.

5

well have been prosecutions.
QUESTION;

6

There may

At least there weren't any

7

appeals.

But assume it, assume it to be the case in the

8

absence cf really definitive evidence that the practice

9

of the executive branch of the government was to

construe the statute as having been intended to relate

11

to postal nexus cases.
MR. GANZFRIED;

I won't

that question.

I think if — if that was Congress’

intent, first of all, it’s a simple matter for them to

That's right.

Well, since it's a case in

8

which

I — I believe that our position is rather simple,

9

we don't have to revise the statute, and I'd suggest

10

that in order to -- to read into the statute the

11

limitation that the petitioners propose, you would have

12

to revise the statute.

13

insert language that Congress certainly could have used

14

in 1935 and had at that point in numerous ether criminal

15

laws relating to the pest office.

You would have to read in and

I'll have to ask you a

QUESTION:

It's been delivered.

The letter's

been delivered.
MR. GANZFRIED;

It's been delivered.

I think

10

our position on that is that once it's been delivered,

11

it’s not mail matter under the terms of the statute.

12

QUESTION:

Sc if I open my neighbor's mailbox

13
14

MR. GANZFRIED:

Sbich would be consistent, I

15

believe, with our position under Section 1708 which

16

covers thefts.

17

QUESTION:

Dc you think that's perfectly clear

18

from the plain language of the statute?

19

that limitation is clear from the plain language of the

20

statute, that the lawful custody means the lawful

21

custody during the transit of the mail as opposed tc

22

some later period of time?

23

MR. GANZFRIED;

Do you think

I think it is, because I tbink

24

ordinarily once mail is delivered, taking the ordinary

25

meaning of the words, that cnce it's delivered,
48

it's --

it's a

letter, it’s not mail.

2

QUESTION*

3

HE. GANZFRIEDs

4

Oh, incidentally, there is one point that I

5

shouldn't sit down without commenting on, and that is

6

the business about this comma.

7

terribly important either way, but the fact of the

8

matter is that in the section of the statute that covers

9

what these petitioners did, there is a comma.

10

It's no longer mail matter.
Nc longer mail matter.

I don't think it's

It’s cn

16

17

I don’t think there was much to that argument to begin

18

with, but in fact, the comma on which it was based or

ORAL ARGUHENT OF CHARLES G. WHITE, ESQ.,

24

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONEES — REEUTTAI

25

HR. WHITE;

So

Just to set the comma business to

49

1

rest, the statute, as you can lock at it in its

2

entirety, contains several references to mail matter, to

3

money,

4

first reference, which is really where the focus of the

5

congressional intent has to — to do with, the very

6

first reference it says — it says "mail matter or any

7

money or other property of the United States," and there

8

is no comma there.

9

realize that — that the Government was quoting from a

The

So that — that’s something I didn't

different section of the statute than what we — we

thought we were talking about.
In any event, interestingly, the Government

12
13

said something very interesting.

14

-- it was for Congress to determine -- and this, I

15

believe, was in answer to Justice O’Connor’s question

16

regarding the -- between whether this was unduly harsh,

17

MB. WHITE;

Certainly.

Certainly, Your

However, the statement that Congressman Dobbins

25

made on the floor was directed exactly to this prevision
