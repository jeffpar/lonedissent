CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER:

2

Now we will hear arguments

3

next in American National Bank and Trust Company against

4

Haroco.
Mr. Egan, you may proceed whenever you are ready.

5

ORAL ARGUMENT OF DONALD E. EGAN, ESQ.,

6

ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONERS.

7

MR. EGAN:

8
9

Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please

the court:
Perhaps the best way to start is by telling you,

10
11

in contrast to what proceeded your lunch, what this case

12

is not about, and then to proceed to tell you what it is

13

about.
It's not about the so-called standing requirement

14
15

articulated by a majority of the judges in the Second

16

Circuit, which implies, and, indeed, requires, a prior

17

criminal conviction, either under RICO or under the predicate

18

offenses.

19

That issue was not addressed by the parties in the

20

Seventh Circuit nor was it addressed by the Seventh Circuit.

21

The second facet of the Sedima case has certain

22

comparable aspects to it, but it's by no means the same, or

23

do we necessarily adopt and follow the position taken by

24

counsel on our side of that case.

25

Now let me tell you what our case is about.

And you don't necessarily, then, take

the position of the Second Circuit?

I need not take that position, Justice

White.

I suppose, if you asked me whether a prior criminal

conviction was required, I'd have to answer you.

think the analytical mind that you will find in our briefs,
in contrast to that on the so-called Racketeering, or RICO,
injury, as opposed to the standing issue, is quite different.
And to respond initially to a question that you raised this
morning, Justice White, we believe that this is a statute
that, indeed, can and should be interpreted by this Court.
And we think that that task can be carried out within the
four corners of the statute itself.

14
15
16

The facts in this case are much like the
hypotheticals that Justice Powell posed to the counsel this
morning.

But I

This is a business dispute between a lender and a
borrower.

The lender in this case is currently with its

parent, the First National Bank of Chicago, the largest
bank in the Chicago metropolitan area.

The borrower was a

businessman.
Loans were made by the bank to this businessman, and
in connection with those loans, the contract between the
parties specified that they would be keyed to the so-called
prime rate, which is alleged in the complaint to be the
4

rate of interest charged by the bank to its largest and

2

most credit-worthy commercial borrowers for 90 day, unsecured,

3

commercial loans.

4

It is alleged that that contract was breached,

5

and that the bank, in fact, charged a greater rate of interest

6

than it should have.

7

This litigation is brought by the borrowers against

8

the bank, against the bank's then-parent, which was a

9

large commercial finance company, named Walter E. Heller,

10

which was then listed on the New York Stock Exchange and

11

by Ronald Grayheck, an Executive Vice President of the bank.

12

The complaint sounds, with the exception of RICO,

13

like the kind of thing that you'd find in any state court

14

in the land today:

15

that the bank breached an alleged fiduciary duty to its

16

borrower, and a claim under an Illinois consumer statute

17

that grants one attorney's fees.

18

a suit for a breach of contract, a claim

The RICO claims that are involved are under 1962(c),

19

relating to the conduct, as opposed to the acquisition and

20

maintenance.

The District Judge, on our motion, dismissed the

22

complaint for failure to plead a RICO injury.

An appeal was

(202) 628-9300

"A

1

any injury to business or property resulting from the

2

underlying acts of racketeering."
In other words, to go back to the discussion in

3
4

which you were engaged with counsel this morning, the position

5

of the Seventh Circuit, which was unanimous, and the Court

6

indicated no interest in holding a hearing en banc or rehearing

7

on banc, was simply that all you require are two predicate

8

acts under 1961 and proximate causality, which is basically

9

automatic.

10

QUESTION: And an enterprise?

11

MR. EGAN:

12

Effectively, what the Seventh Circuit --

13

QUESTION:

14

And an enterprise.

And you need something besides the two

predicate acts to -- an enterprise or not?

15

MR. EGAN:

No, Your Honor, you do not.

16

QUESTION:

Not under the Seventh Circuit?

17

MR. EGAN:

Not under the Seventh Circuit's analysis.

18

The Seventh Circuit, I think, made it abundantly clear what

19

they were doing.

20

out of the -- and 1962 (a) and (b), by implication, although

21

the case here relates only to 1962 (c).

22
23
24
25

They were effectively reading 1962(c)

It is our position that that interpretation of the
statute is unwarranted.
The standards to which this Court must adhere in
interpreting the statute are well known.

They are spelled

out in Mohasco v. Silver.

They require, one, an examination

of the language of the statute; two, a plain meaning of the
statute, not contraty to legislative intent; and, three, no
policy reasons not to follow that plain meaning.
The statute, at least superficially, seems to be
somewhat complex.

As a matter of fact, in one of the other

RICO cases that the Seventh Circuit has decided, it is
described as a treasure hunt.
But we submit that it is not all that complex, once
it is read as an integrated whole.
What is required in the first instance is a
violation of one of the two predicate acts.
Now, there was a good deal of discussion this
morning about two acts alone being sufficient, under RICO.

15

I would suggest to the Court that, while that issue is not

16

necessarily one that you need address, the definitional

17

section of RICO does not define a pattern of racketeering

18

activity as at least two acts of racketeering.

19

requires at least two acts of racketeering activity.

20
21

It says it

It can reasonably be inferred, it seems to me, that
you are dealing with a threshold without Congress having

22

addressed at what level the pattern of racketeering activity

23

or the number of predicate acts rises to the necessary

24

status for purposes of concluding that you do, indeed, have

25

a pattern of racketeering activity.

12

Now that middle ground, the one that must be
hurdled before one gets on to the injury issue, is what
is ignored by the Seventh Circuit's decision.

15
16
17

The net effect, as I mentioned a moment ago, is
that I, as the aggrieved victim, if you will, of a so-called
racketeering injury, need only establish two acts of mail
fraud -- taking the liberal reading of pattern of racketeering
activity -- and I've stated a RICO claim.

QUESTION:

Mr. Egan, a moment ago you said that

the Seventh Circuit had read out what you referred to as

QUESTION:

Did you make this argument in the

MR. EGAN:

We did not make this precise argument,

Your Honor.
QUESTION: So you're not attacking, challenging,

6

the Seventh Circuit decision on the basis that you

presented below?

8

10

MR. EGAN:

I would say we are not challenging

it on a different basis, Your Honor.
What happened in the interim was the Seventh

11

Circuit came down with its decision, and after the case

12

was argued in the Seventh Circuit, but before it was

13

decided, the Sedima trilogy came down.

14

The argument that we made in the Seventh Circuit

15

implicates the very same point I'm making here, namely

16

that the statute had to be read as an integrated whole.

17

The cases at that juncture, including the District Court

18

decision, from which the appeal was taken, adopted the

19

so-called racketeering injury really in a void, without

20

any analysis

In any event, the net result now, in contrast

MR. EGAN:

of standing, and their approach to the meaning of a
RICO injury was an "injury of the type that RICO was
calculated to reach."

to the extent that the

And this has

Mr. Egan, what, again, is it?- As I

understand it, the Seventh Circuit says you need a

18

Now, what more is it that you think 1962(c)

MR. EGAN:

Nineteen-sixty-two(c), by its very

19

terms, requires that after you have an enterprise, that the

20

enterprise be either conducted, or that the person conduct

21

the affairs of that enterprise, in other words, run it.

22

In other words, getting back to what you Justices were

23

asking this morning, isn't this statute really calculated

24

to take care of the person who goes out with illegal

25

gains and acquires a business, or someone who uses illegal

11
ALC-RSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

gains to maintain a business, or, lastly, someone who
2

steps in and conducts the business, runs the business?
3

QUESTION: Through through a pattern of -4

MR. EGAN:

Through a pattern of racketeering

5

activity. • But you must run the business.

You have to

6

conduct the affairs.
7

This is not dealing with incidental involvement,
8

and in a sense that gets you back to the point that
9

Justice Powell was making this morning and the implication
10

of mail fraud.
11

QUESTION:

Well, is your client, it's a bank

12

and it's a subsidiary of another bank?
13

MR. EGAN:

At the time of the operative events

14

here, it was a subsidiary of a commercial finance company
15

which was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
16

It was a subsidiary of First Chicago Corporation.

17

It was sold in the interim period.

QUESTION:

I think, metaphysically, I have some

took the position, although Judge Decker at the trial
level had disposed of the case only on motion to dismiss,
we had argued the enterprise person issue as well.
In the Seventh Circuit, we raised again the

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

enterprise person issue.

Judge Cudahy accepted our

2

argument in terms of the need for there to be a separate
3

person, separate from the enterprise, but concluded that,
4

yes, indeed, in response to your question, a subsidiary
5

could conduct the affairs of its parent.
6

QUESTION:

So you say what's missing in this

7

case is proof of conducting the affairs of an enterprise?
8

HR. EGAN:

Allegations sufficient, Your Honor,

9

to satisfy pleading requirements that, indeed, either
10

American National conducted the affairs of its parent by
11

charging a higher interest rate than it agreed to.

I mean,

12

that's the essence of this thing.
13

This is about as far

removed from mail fraud as you'll get.

14

Indeed, the action, the original action in
15

the pendent state counts didn't even contain a common
16

law fraud claim.

17

QUESTION:

Well, the question that you presented

18

for review here was whether a civil claimant has staffered
19

20
21

damages merely by reason of the defendant's commission
of the prescribed offenses, without more?
HR. EGAN:

That's right.

QUESTION:

Or rather by reason of the defendant's

22
23

inquiring, or conducting?

Do you think this question

24

substernes what you are arguing?
25

HR. EGAN:

No, Your Honor, I don't.

That's precisely my point.
My point is that what the Seventh Circuit
did was read the language that you'll find there, acquiring,
maintaining control of an interest in or conducting the
affairs of anoenterprise through.
QUESTION:

I think Justice White's question

was directed to whether you think the question you
presented for review fairly subsumes the point that you
are now making.
MR. EGAN:

Yes.

QUESTION:

Mr. Egan, may I ask you, I still

have the same problem I think Justice Rehnquist did.
It focuses on 1962(c).
Assume that the complaint alleges that you made

15

a lot of loans and that's part of the affairs of the

16

bank, to make loans, and that you did so by repeatedly

17
18
19

20
21

22
23
24
25

making false representations as to what the major
customers were getting, the prime rate, and, therefore,
you repeatedly committed mail fraud or telephone fraud
or something like that.
Why, then, would that not be a pattern of
activity, a pattern of racketeering activity, through
which you conducted the affairs of the enterprise?
MR. EGAN:

My position on that, Justice Stevens,

would be that that is no different than any other loan

No, Your Honor.

And it's a matter

of record that we didn't in this case, either.
QUESTION:

But that's what's alleged.

If, in

fact, you repeatedly and regularly made fraudulent
misrepresentations and mailed them out to satisfy the
mailing requirement.

I really don't quite understand

why that doesn't satisfy the definition under your
analysis of the statute.

Yes, but you don't regularly and

routinely make fraudulent statements in making your

MR. EGAN:

Well, I think that perhaps I can

best- respond to that by giving the Court an example of
an instance, and these are reported cases, in which you
did have conducting the affairs of an enterprise in a
fashion that did pass muster.

Indeed, one of them,

ironically enough, was the example that the Seventh
Circuit used in Schacht v.. Brown, which is one of the
cases that's routinely cited by the people on the other
side of this issue, and, indeed, one that troubled Judge
Cudahy when he addressed our argument in the Seventh
Circuit.
In that case, the Seventh Circuit specifically

found that the accountants and the insurance holding company
facilitated the maintenance of the business--that is, the
insurance company, holding company--well beyond the point
that it would have been able to do so by reason of fraudulent
reinsurance agreements and misstatements of its financial
condition.

QUESTION:

18
19

20

Well, I thought an awful lot of the

business of banks was making loans and charging interest.
I would think that you're really running your business when
you make loans and collect interest, aren't you?

17

of things, of what rate

you're going to charge someone interest, is not conducting

12
13

I think the making, the determination,

MR. EGAN:

That's certainly one facet, Your Hdnor.

But I don't think that goes to the essence of running your
business.
In Bennett v. Berg, for example, an Eighth Circuit
case, the Court concluded that the owner of a retirement

21

home had routinely defrauded people who bought retirement

22

contracts; that afterwards they had conducted the affairs

23

of the retirement home in a fraudulent manner and continued

24

to bilk money from these people.

25

I think that those examples come much closer to

My question is if, by reason of a series of

MR. HARTUNIAN:

(202) 628-9300

Petitioners' argument in this case really amounts
to a request to imply certain requirements of proof in
place of the absence of the words that Congress could
have used had it chosen to impose such requirements.

5

6
7

The words of Section 1962(c), which govern this
case, are very clear.

Any person violates RICO whenever

he conducts or participates in the conduct of the affairs

8

of an interstate enterprise through a pattern of racketeering

9

activity which is defined as several predicate acts.

10

Those words are clear enough.

11

Petitioners say that that is not enough.

They

12

say he must be a manager, and then, in the reply brief, they

13

shift it back to saying well, it's okay if he's a low level

14

person, I suppose upon being confronted with the fact that

15

this Court has already construed the word "conduct" in

16

other settings to mean low level people.

17

have to be a boss or a manager or a supervisor.

18

It does not

And now Mr. Egan comes before you and tells you

19

again that it must be some kind of managerial function

20

involved when the pattern of racketeering activities

21

22

occurred.
It's interesting that the Petitioners say that

23

if it is a nonmanagerial person, that person may still

24

violate the act if his activities had some "integral

25

relationship" and with the management of the enterprise.

25
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

And they say that that means the activities were the means
2
3
4

by which the enterprise is being managed, to quote from
their brief.
That's interesting, because what that apparently

5

6
7

means is that in order for the activities to come within
the act, the activities have to be directed by the management
of the enterprise or blessed by the management of the

8

enterprise.
9

Those requirements don't appear in the act.

And

10

what they lead to is what occurred to me last night as
11

amounting to a variation of the Nurenberg defense.

Because

12

according to Petitioners, a defendant can become exonerated
13

for his activities if he can demonstrate that he was not
14

acting under orders.
15

That's a bizarre kind of approach to the
16

statute, and it's a very strange kind of interpretation
17

to seek, particularly where what we're talking about when
18

we discuss the enterprise and its affairs is not whether
19

the enterprise is guilty.

The only issue in which the

20

concept of the enterprise is implicated is whether the
21

person was guilty of whatever it was that Congress said was
22

so evil as to bring it within the penumbra of this act.
23

QUESTION:

Mr. Hartunian, if an employees of,

24

for example, a bank conducted a pattern of fraudulent

activity, such as you have alleged here, but only for the

purpose of putting the money in his own pocket and not

2

going into the bank's coffers, would that meet the

3

statutory requirement?

4

MR. HARTUNIAN:

Since I think the test is -- and

5

I think it's clear -- the test is whether the frauds were

6

committed in the course of transacting bank business, those

7

facts are absent from the hypothetical as presented.

8

the person was engaging in some kind of fraudulent activity

9

which was bank business, then, clearly, there's no

10
11

reason to exonerate him.

Does that mean they were charging other

MR. HARTUNIAN:

Is that what you mean?

That's right.

The prime rate is an important benchmark which
relieves both sides, particularly the borrower, of going
shopping. If he knows what the rate of interest is at which
his bank is lending money to Chrysler, he may very well say
to himself well, that's good enough for me this week.

And

then when the bank says to him well, we'll charge you 1.5 perc ent
over the best rate which we're charging that week and we'll
let you know what that is, and he says fine, I accept that,
and they send him a bill saying' this week our prime rate is
10 percent, you owe us a point and a half more than that,
here is your bill for interest at 11.5 percent, and he pays
it, trusting them -- he doesn't know that's a lie -- they're
really charging 8 percent, that's really the correct rate.

Well, we haven't had discovery;

but it unsettles me a little to think that that's part of
the reason.

Because I think the theory upon which the complaint

is brought, which is important to analyze what this
statute means, doesn't require any discovery.

What the

statute says is that certain persons are liable, criminally
or civilly, and whether that liability attends depends, in
part, not only on these other requirements of whether the
predicate acts were violated and whether there was a pattern
connecting those predicate acts, but also to what extent
was he engaging in the business of an interstate enterprise.

14
15

That's

And the reason for that, I think, is that Congress
is establishing a nexus between the criminality and interstate
commerce.

That was obviously of great importance to Congress.
Before getting to that, though, I just want to

mention, quickly, that Congress could easily have used the
words Petitioners say belong in this statute.

Easily.

They are words familiar to all of us, all lawyers and all
members of Congress:

manage, supervise, direct.

But those

words are absent from the statute.
If Congress wanted to insist on any such element,

24

they could easily have used those words.

used the phrase "substantial relation to" or "integrally

Because, instead of using words

of constriction, words affording defenses--and, as a matter

would impose requirements on the prosecutor in the first
instance and on the plaintiff as a necessary element.
it's not just a matter of defense.

One question that came up this morning is whether

case.

13

the enterprise is primarily corrupt or completely corrupt.

And, of course, that is not the

It wouldn't make any difference to Congress whether

14

As a matter of fact, union activities are covered

15

in this statute explicitly, and I cannot imagine any

16

union ever, however corrupt it became, however involved in

17

criminal activities, any such union ever becoming primarily

18

involved in corruption, because it would always tend to

19

the business of negotiating contracts and doing many legal

20

things.

21

22

So that could not possibly have been Congress'
intention.

23

No.

24

The reason why Congress inserted the enterprise

25

requirement is as a vehicle by which to test the person's

If a person throws

The way that Congress decided to test whether

5

the monkeywrench is in interstate commerce or somewhere else

6

where Congress didn't have a vital interest at that time was

7

to see whether he was working on the affairs of that

8

enterprise.

It's as simple as that.

9

(A) and (b), Subsections (a) and (b) deal with

10

infiltration, and so the enterprise forms the vehicle to

11

determine what it is that needs to be infiltrated.

12

But (c) has nothing to do with infiltration.

(C)

13

deals only with the pernicious effects of criminality

14

on commerce.

15

Congress to consider not only whether the person was

16

involved in the affairs of an interstate enterprise, but

17

whether he was a manager, or whether he was carrying out a

18

policy.

19

It would be a strange thing, indeed, for

Congress wouldn't care about such things like that.
QUESTION:

Would Congress care if the employee

20

who did the overcharging was acting contrary to the express

directions of management?

No.

Congress would not care about

that either.

person, whether there's any racketeering activities is

be the one against whom a judgment would be made.

QUESTION:

There were'several questions asked this morning,
and I find myself so much at odds with the answers that I
feel compelled to answer.
First of all, I think the question was asked,
would it have an impact in criminal prosecutions if the
Sedima prior conviction rule were approved by this Court.
I must say it would have a slight, if any, impact,
and probably a good one, I must confess.

The impact would

be that complaining witnesses' victims would have more of
an incentive to bring cases to the prosecutor.
But, of course, that has nothing to do with
whether there is such a requirement.

The fact is that

there is nothing stated in the act.

I know of no case,

no statute, in which bringing a civil suit depends on a
prior conviction.

And Congress known of no such statute.

Had Congress had any such intention to effect
such a radical departure from the procedure, you know, with a}l
of the other statutes, virtually all of the other statutes
of the United States, you would think Congress would have
explicitly said so.
QUESTION:

Hr. Hartunian, do you agree that

your burden of proof of the predicate acts would have to
be beyond a reasonable doubt?
MR. HARTUNIAN:

No.

Were this not a fraud this, were this a case

39
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

involving some one of the other predicate acts, excluding
2

securities fraud, I would say that it's simply a preponderance.
3
4

What gives me pause about the fraud element is
that there are many cases, in particular there was one

5

Federal case, there was one case decided by this Court
6

in which it was stated that the traditional burden of proof
7

in fraud civil cases is clear and convincing evidence.
8

Another question that has been raised is what
9

constitutes a pattern?
10

A pattern is not defined in the act.

The word

11

"pattern" is not defined at all, and there is no attempt
12

to define the word.

The normal rule of interpretation

13

is that a pattern is what the ordinary usage of the
14

word means it to be.
15

QUESTION:

Do you think that it may mean something

16

more than a single episode conducted by mail?
17

MR. HARTUNIAN:

I think that in the single

18

instance in which there are two offenses, a single transactioh
19

in which there are two offenses, and that can happen
20

easily, that's probably one of the cases in which Congress
21

viewed the requirement as being more than two.
22

I admit there might be cases in which there are
23

more than two.

And what Congress was doing by saying it

24

requires at least two was making sure that no Court says
25

that the minimum is something higher.

QUESTION: And that’s one of the recommendations

2

in the ABA study, is it not, that we should look at what

3

a pattern means?

episode.

5

It may mean something more than a single

HR. HARTUNIAN:

The ABA study — and I think I

6

read the preliminary report -- I think is in error in

7

assuming that the way the law is written now, that any

8

two acts amounts to a pattern.

There has to be a connection.

9

That's an important difference.

And it has to be something

10

more than one transaction.

11

That makes sense to me.

The reason I talk about what makes sense is

12

because Congress left it open for interpretation by not

13

specifically defining the word.
But, at any rate, it may be three, it may be

14
15

four.

It depends on the facts, and it depends on whether

16

there is a connection between the events that make up

17

the pattern, as to whether or not a pattern exists.
One question raised this morning had to do

18
19

with the tital of the act and the obvious purpose.

20

Justice Rehnquist raised this question,
I'm sure, when you asked that, I remember that

There is no question that the underlying

6

legislation, was organized crime.

open to doubt that what Congress intended in the language,

8

in the act which was eventually enacted, was something

9

much broader.

But it is also not

The Congressmen's statements make that clear.

10

The fact that some of the Congressmen said we cannot

11

make this a status based offense, and then some Congressmen

12

teased others for even considering the idea of making

13

a status based offense because the Congressmen themselves

14

not only feel obedient to the Constitution and to the

15

decisions of this Court, but they, themselves, presumably

16

believe in its principles.

17

So Congress would not want to pass a status

18

based offense.

19

passed an act which it deliberately meant to embrace

20

people, far beyond organized crime.

And, therefore, that means that Congress

To put it in a nutshell, in the terms of our

23

case, Congress intended to deter fraud committed by

24

organized crime by deterring fraud, period, by any person.

25

QUESTION:

But that doesn't really explain

42
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

why it's entitled the Racketeering, Influence, and Corrupt

2

Organizations.

3
4

It was simply to deter fraud,

MR, HARTUNIAN:
no.

Well, that doesn't explain it,

But I think an adequate explanation for the title is

5

because that was the purpose for which Congress sat down

6

in the first place and talked about such a thing.

7

The war on organized crime has been going on for

8

more statutes than just this one.

9

pieces of legislation, some of which have been enacted

10

into law -- the Travel Act, the Hobbs Act, and I think

11

the Hobbs Act's predecesor was called the Anti-Racketeering

12

Act -- all of which were designed to deal with this problem.

13

There's no doubt that, up until the moment the statute

14

was passed -- not up until, until now -- Congress'

15

primary purpose was to deal with the pernicious influence

16

of organized crime.

17

There have been several

But that does not mean that Congress intended

18

that this statute apply only to organized crime. That

19

is impossible.

20

And Congress said that's not what they were

21

doing.

makes it clear that when it says "any person" who commits

23

the predicate acts, that's to be taken literally.

QUESTION:

The last thing you want to mention in

3

your whole argument?
4

MR. HARTUNIAN:

Yes.

5

QUESTION:

When are you going to discuss -- do we

6

assume that you don't want to say any more than what was
7

said in the prior case on the issue that the Petition
8

presented?
9

MR. HARTUNIAN:

I do want to say it.

I misspoke

10

when I said the last thing I want to say in the whole
11

argument.
12

The last thing I want to say in response to the
13

Petitioners' argument is that one of the notes Petitioners
14

made, one of the observations Petitioners made is that the
15

Blue Chip Rule and other rules of this Court will be
16

gutted by this statute.

If that were true, then that would

17

be the way it is.

But that's not true.

18

When Congress included a separate predicate act
19

called Securities Fraud, it's quite clear that Congress
20

meant that to be the exclusive predicate act for securities
21

fraud.

Otherwise, it would make no sense for Congress to

22

include both the mail fraud provision and the securities
23

fraud provision -- unless

in the unlikely case Congress

24

wanted a special provision to cover securities frauds
25

not committed through the use of the mails or the wires, or

44
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.
20 F ST., N.W., WASHINGTON, D.C. 20001

(202) 628-9300

1

telephones.

2

It would be a rareity and would not justify Congress'

3

putting in a special provision about securities fraud.

4

It's unlikely that such a thing could happen.

In addition, Congress restricted the securities

5

fraud provision to the sale of securities. That doesn't

6

cover the purchase of securities.

7

Now, with respect to the injury requirement, the

8

most important thing about the injury requirement, as

9

imposed by the District Court, and the reason why the Seventh

10

Circuit reversed it, is because, not only does it not

11

exist, not only does it not appear anywhere in the statute,

12

but no one, no one up until that time, had even defined

13

what it is.

14

District Judge said was that this is not a RICO injury,

15

and you have to have a RICO injury, and he didn't tell us

16

what it was.

17
18
19

The District Court certainly didn't.

All the

As we told the Seventh Circuit, we don't even know
if we comply, because we don't know what the requirement is.
Now, the only time I know of in which any

20

Court which took this point of view and dismissed cases for

21

lacking a RICO, a distinct RICO enterprise injury, was when

22

the Second Circuit described the hypothetical of the person

23

suffering from two arsons and, as a result, not being able

24

to get insurance.

25

incorrectly assumes that each person must himself be

The hypothetical, first of all,

4

victimized by two acts.

That's not required.

The focus of the pattern requirement is to
eliminate sporadic activity, to get rid of the case in which
somebody commits just one offense now and some other offense

5

unrelated, either because of time or a different kind of

6

offense, or something.

7

It's because Congress was typifying organized

8

crime, a thread which appears throughout the statute,

9

that the pattern requirement was imposed.

And for that

10

reason, since a pattern is required', then there really is

11

no sense to taking the view that the pattern is something

12

which, in and of itself, must cause injury to two people.

13

If a person brings himself within the statute

14

by his conduct, by committing a pattern, that's what Congress

15

was interested in -- not whether both offenses were

16

committed against the same person.

17

rationality to that.

There's really no

18

Host importantly, the pattern requirement does not

19

lend itself to a "but for" analysis, simply because Congress

20

did not, and could not

21

22

rather than the individual components.

23

have, envisioned injuried separately

But, in the last analysis, the most important

24

thing is that Congress, although it could easily have

25

enunciated such a requirement in words, didn't do so.

ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

There are ample, adequate reasons to account for why the

pattern requirement is in the statute, without making it

part of a "but for" analysis.
QUESTION:

Hay I ask one other question?

5

There is a certain area of agreement between you
6

and your opponent that the pattern is something different
7

from two predicate acts.
8

HR. HARTUNIAN:

Yes.

9

QUESTION: Supposing you had a pattern that
10

consisted of several acts, five or ten.

Do they all have

11

to be felonies?

It seems to me that, under your view of

12

a kind of connection and all, you might well have evidence
13

of a pattern that was not itself a predicate act, necessarily
14

MR, HARTUNIAN: Well, all the predicate acts are
15

felonies, except one.
16

QUESTION:

I know all the required ones are.

17

I'm just wondering, if you had a half dozen acts in
18

establishing your pattern, under your view the plaintiff
19

could recover if any one of the acts caused injury,
20

proximately caused injury.
21

MR. HARTUNIAN:

Yes.

22

QUESTION:

Whereas your opponent would say the

23

pattern itself has to someone or other

cause injury.

24

MR, HARTUNIAN:

Not only do we say that, but

25

if the person that we're suing goes and commits an act,

47
ALDERSON REPORTING COMPANY, INC.

(202) 628-9300

But

1

a predicate act, against each of nine or ten people, and

2

it had nothing to do with me, and then he commits his

3

eleventh act and injures me, if I show a pattern between

4

the acts, between the one in which he injured me and

5

any one or more of the prior acts, he, then, is liable to

6

me as a person under RICO, because he has engaged in a

7

pattern.

QUESTION: Since you've also been injured by a
pattern?

10

MR. HARTUNIAN:

QUESTION:

12

Well, you've been injured by a crime

that's part of a pattern?

I have not been injured --

MR. HARTUNIAN:

Yes, a crime that's part of a

pattern.

15

QUESTION:

And what do you think, in addition

16

to the predicate acts, is necessary to show, to prove a

17

pattern?

18

How do you prove a pattern?
MR. HARTUNIAN:

Well, I view a pattern as a

negative thing.

when the elements of which it is comprised are not

21

unconnected.

Now,

10

subject intent.

We do it by objective evidence. But

11

we can tell certain things about the relationship between
12

one act or another just by the profile and the attributes
13

by which they occur.
14

When we can infer something about act A from the
15

facts of act B, then I think we have a pattern.

If the

16

two have something in common --

it mightbe the victim,

17

it might be the purpose, it might be the method by which
18

it was conducted -- but if there is a connection, then,
19

such as to take him out of the realm of being the sporadic
20

violator that Congress wasn't concerned with, then that
21

connection comprises the pattern and satisfies the reason
22

why Congress inserted the requirement.
23

MR. HARTUNIAN:

Yes. But our view of "conducted"

2

means taking any part, because I think that's what

Congress clearly meant, and that's what this Court said
4

in Sunobry, United States v. Sunobry, about the use of
5

the word "conduct" in this same act, but in a different

title.

It's any person, whether it's a boss or a street

employee, a person who's a runner in a numbers game or
8

an unlawful gambling operation.

He is certainly a person

9

against whom this statute is directed.

He doesn't

10

conduct anything except drive his car up and back.

He

certainly is liable so long as he takes part in the

activities.

ON BEHALF OF PETITIONERS -- REBUTTAL
9

MR. EGAN:

Briefly, Your Honors.

20

Mr. Hartunian's presentation, like Mr. Hartunian's
21

brief, nowhere attempts to define what a RICO injury is.
22

Our position is that the RICO injury can only
23

be defined by determining what Congress meant when it
24

talked about conducting the affairs through a pattern
25

of racketeering activity.

1

Perhaps Justice Stevens and I part company
2

in terms of how intimately involved in the conduct of the
3

affairs of the American National Bank through a pattern
4

of alleged racketeering activity the setting of interest
5

rates may be.

But that's what the statute says.

6

And until and unless you do that, you can't answer the
7

issue which we bring before you, Justice White, namely,
8
9

what is a RICO injury.

That's the very same issue that

was addressed by the Seventh Circuit.

It's the issue

10

that this Court must address.
11

Thank you.
