the

The point of all of this is net that the Court

7

of Appeals was insufficiently school in the craft of

intelligence to prepare the correct definition for when

9

10

The point is that in the 19h7 National Security Act,

11

Congress assigned

that responsibility to the Director of

It is difficult for courts to obtain evidence

16

in the way they determine these issues, as was the

17

District Court in the Fitzgibbcn case which we cite in

5

appreciable, much as is the situation in this case,

6

where

7

especially when the passage of time may cause the

many cf the sources are 20 or 30 years old.
In conclusion, it is cur position that Section

8

403(a)(3) means what it says when it says that the

9

Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible

10

for protecting intelligence sources and methods frcir

11

unauthorized disclosure, and this plain language of

the two-part test crafted by the Court of
